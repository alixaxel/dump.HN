I&#x27;m not sure how accurate that is, but honestly even as a casual gamer I couldn&#x27;t imagine having access to that low a percentage of games. If I were running games on Linux I would have missed out on Rocket League which is now probably one of my all-time favorite games.<p>So, I guess I just don&#x27;t see the point of using Linux for games <i>at all</i>. The phrase &quot;cutting of your nose to spite your face&quot; comes to mind because I can&#x27;t think of one reason that isn&#x27;t purely ideological.<p>Anyway, the info about the Windows 10 upgrade has been out for some time.

Unlike the taxi market, it does not appear to reduce vehicle count or improve passenger experience via better service.<p>Better service in a regular route context comes mostly from dedicated right of way and platforms. The classic example is Curitiba&#x27;s bus system in lieu of a subway system It could not afford.

10060424,comment,10058199,10058723,0,0,norea-armozel,,,"I think part of the problem is that our welfare system is also very flaky. Take for example a single mother who isn&#x27;t working currently which takes in some amount of money from SNAP and TANF. If she takes a job immediately of any wage her SNAP benefits go down by some percentage (sometimes it&#x27;s small but sometimes it&#x27;s very large as much as 80% as it was for my sister) and her TANF benefits go away immediately. There&#x27;s no gradient or curve for the sun-setting of the benefits as her income increases. Even the &#x27;workfare&#x27; program is a joke because it doesn&#x27;t pay enough to make sure hypothetical single mother has enough to pay rent, groceries, and other necessities. And I&#x27;m not going to talk about daycare but it&#x27;s clear that&#x27;s FUBAR by default (it doesn&#x27;t exist in the US at least as I know of as a benefit).<p>So, if the US were to fix bottom end of poverty it would have to be in restructuring and probably centralizing the dispensation of welfare. I think no state or local government should be involved in the administration of said benefits since the lion&#x27;s share of the funds come from the US government itself (not from the budgets of the state or local governments). But the chances of that happening is about as good as my chances of winning the Power Ball.",1439564326

If a company manages to attract a community of people volunteering and contributing data, it&#x27;s wrong for that to be taken away. Hopefully it won&#x27;t be taken away completely in this case, but if the app is phased out, then you&#x27;ll just have to hope your data shows up within google maps in some form. You&#x27;re at their mercy. The data was collected by the community but it never belonged to the community.<p>There&#x27;s a broad principle here which I think we need to be more collectively savvy about. Community &quot;Crowd sourcing&quot; should always go hand-in hand with community ownership of the data. This means open licensing and offering of bulk downloads. There needs to be increased awareness, and strong campaigns against the behaviour of companies who recruit a volunteer community, but don&#x27;t give the data back (and I mean give it back properly, in a raw unencumbered open-licensed form)<p>Waze is not the worst example of this because I think a lot of waze contribution is in the form of very <i>passive</i> data collection. The value comes from algorithms rather than dedicated passionate contribution from volunteers. But even so. The community puts data in. The community loses the data in the end.",1439564318

If you can&#x27;t figure out how to communicate with people you see every day on those points, then I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re clever enough to figure out how to write code in the first place. You&#x27;re fired. Pack up your things and get out.<p>I&#x27;ve seen way too many organizations use &quot;we&#x27;re standing up&quot; to mean &quot;therefore, we&#x27;re having a productive meeting&quot;. I&#x27;ve seen places do 50-person standup meetings. Yes, they would go two hours. I&#x27;ve seen other places get the number of people right but do full-status-report standup meetings. Yes, they would also go two hours. That&#x27;s a quarter of your work day, probably half of your productive work day, just wasted on an emotionally draining process.<p>Last time I had daily status meetings that worked, I had my entire team in one room, we had a large whiteboard with every task we were working on between us, and when everyone got in, had their coffee, got through their emails, I would turn around in my chair, ask if everyone was ready, and we&#x27;d just go through the list. We would scratch things off when they&#x27;d get finished, so we always knew who was getting what done anyway, and everyone had their names next to what they were working on, so we knew what they were working on already. It was mostly just a chance for someone to ask for help on something. It took about 15 minutes. If new tasks didn&#x27;t fit on the board, they didn&#x27;t fit in the team&#x27;s workload.<p>I think there is something to be said for not placing the focus on individual contributors but on the tasks as a whole, on the team as a whole. My meetings didn&#x27;t pit people against each other, &quot;oh, Jim got 3 things done yesterday and has never been blocked on 1 thing for over a week, but Dave has made zero progress on his task since two days ago. Shame, Dave, shame. Let us not question whether the task was specified correctly or appropriately broken down.&quot;",1439563698

I recall reading that there were 6 different versions of the Service Pack update for Office 2000 depending on where you got them from, and they weren&#x27;t all compatible with each other.  Do you think after another decade of Monkey Boy and his winning business strategy of pitting all the departments against each other that they&#x27;ve improved?  Nardella actually seems like a grown-up, but he&#x27;s still a dyed-in-the-wool Microsoft exec.... less stupid certainly, but just as evil.<p>One of the biggest problems with Microsoft is that they are too big and disorganized.  They have no vision, and no guiding principle, other than maintaining the lingering shreds of their monopoly.  This is obvious from looking at the designed-by-committee, piecemeal UI for Windows, which is getting worse every release and not better.  The best you can hope for for any particular feature from release to release is that it&#x27;s just arbitrarily different and not broken or hidden or completely removed.<p>Windows clearly peaked with XP, but their UI peaked with Windows 2000.  The only reason 7 is liked is because they backed off most of the bad things they did with Vista, and the only thing, the _only_ thing I think is better in Windows 8 than any previous version is Task Manager, which is not something I use often.  But it is nice.<p>My #1 wish for Windows post-7 is that I could just use the &quot;Classic&quot; theme, but apparently Windows is now too sophisticated to do what it could do 15 years ago.   Their UX department has gone totally off the rails or maybe was taken over by wild monkeys.  Microsoft used to be _the_ place for good UI design back in the 90s.  They were very scientific about it, and their designs were very well-thought out, based on CUA, and an absurd amount of user-testing and most of all, consistent.  Not perfect, but they were very good.  But as soon as graphics cards could do more than 256 colors and Photoshop was invented, everyone went wild and UI became the lawless, Wild West funhouse it remains today.  Except in the past few years, everyone decided that the &quot;flat look&quot; is cool (news flash:  it&#x27;s ugly and hard to make out) and now we have UIs that are as usable and good-looking as Windows 2, but without the consistency.<p>I&#x27;d thought Microsoft had run out of sharks to jump with Windows 8, but they keep finding more.  But here&#x27;s the thing.  I still like Windows.  I just wish I could make Windows look at work like it did when it looked and worked well (I&#x27;m not referring to the underlying technology, which is presumably improving all the time, although I still think Windows 8 is absurdly slow compared to 7 and much worse compared to XP... and I have empirical evidence.  I do a lot of work in a Windows 2003 VM running on VirtualBox (long story) and it&#x27;s much faster than the Windows 7 host and doesn&#x27;t suffer from the, oh gee, everything&#x27;s going to go &quot;Not Responding&quot; for 30 seconds to 2 minutes for no apparent reason that I see with the apps (at least MS apps) on the host.",1439563661

He found out that because he wasn&#x27;t a government employee, those programs treated him like shit.[0]<p>> One of the things that has not been widely reported by journalists is that whistle-blower protection laws in the US do not protect contractors in the national security arena. There are so many holes in the laws, the protections they afford are so weak, and the processes for reporting they provide are so ineffective that they appear to be intended to discourage reporting of even the clearest wrongdoing. If I had revealed what I knew about these unconstitutional but classified programs to Congress, they could have charged me with a felony. One only need to look at the case of Thomas Drake to see how the government doesn&#x27;t have a good history of handling legitimate reports of wrongdoing within the system.<p>> Despite this, and despite the fact that I could not legally go to the official channels that direct NSA employees have available to them, I still made tremendous efforts to report these programs to co-workers, supervisors, and anyone with the proper clearance who would listen. The reactions of those I told about the scale of the constitutional violations ranged from deeply concerned to appalled, but no one was willing to risk their jobs, families, and possibly even freedom to go through what Drake did.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/snowden-not-all-spying-bad-but-nsa-program-divorced-from-reason/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/snowden-not-all-spying-bad-but-nsa-...</a><p>Every time I&#x27;ve been a contractor[1], I&#x27;ve been treated likewise.<p>[1]never been contracted out to a government agency of any level.",1439563124

That opinion puts you in the minority of the technical world, to say the least.<p>> Only solution i can see that really works is if the true sender &quot;breaks the bus&quot; when it detects a malicious sender is using it&#x27;s source address, as is done when you get ID-collisions<p>This is a solution that requires perfect implementation from every component.  As long as this is actually a specified behavior, written down somewhere that you have to implement to mark your part as &quot;CAN2-compliant&quot;, that would be OK, but I doubt that&#x27;s going to happen.<p>In general, though, I oppose requiring every node on a network operate perfectly to maintain security.<p>>  The bandwidth of CAN is quite limited so including cryptographic signatures with proper strength in every message is not an option.<p>So don&#x27;t include a signature in every message.  Nobody does that in the computer world, you authenticate a session.  There&#x27;s still no reason for the head unit to be opening up a session with the brakes, and the brakes should reject such a connection attempt.<p>I realize that this isn&#x27;t possible with the architecture of the CAN bus, but the CAN bus is just not suitable for nodes which are connected to the internet and broadcast wifi hotspots.  The failure case of a CAN bus attack is just not appropriate - once you&#x27;re on, that&#x27;s it, you can do anything.  There&#x27;s going to have to be some changes, and the sooner we accept that fact the sooner we can start working on a solution.  If we need a network with a cleaner electrical source and more bandwidth, that can no longer be driven with 8-bit micros on an unfiltered alternator, well, that&#x27;s the price of having nice things.  We&#x27;ll have to buy the $1 part instead of the $.30 part to get the power windows onto the network.

More likely you&#x27;d require node authentication (a function of the application layer, layer 7).<p>I have real doubts that manufacturers can/will implement airgaps and read-only circuitry properly.  Jeep tried, and now they&#x27;re doing a recall.  Auto companies are only starting to realize that they are actually in the business of computer security now, and it will be years before there&#x27;s been enough of these recalls for them to come to terms with the magnitude of this task.  The fact that they are still operating on the walled-garden concept - inside of which all messages are taken on face value - is ample evidence of this.<p>Real airgaps imply a severe degradation of functionality from what both consumers and auto companies have come to expect.  The days of your entertainment unit being able to control anything in your car will be gone, as will things like over-the-air firmware updates, remote door unlocks, etc.  This is just not going to happen in a feature-driven world.  And all it takes is for someone to leave one firmware-flash bit unset and the entire thing is worthless.  Expecting that airgaps and read-only circuitry will be implemented, and implemented <i>perfectly</i>, every time, is wildly unrealistic, and with that security model the failure case is <i>brutal</i>.

Cars are now connected to the internet and broadcast wifi networks, they can no longer blindly trust messages on their internal networks.  That&#x27;s the thing auto companies have to fundamentally come to grips with, regarding them now being in the business of computer security.  If you want cars to be on the internet, validating signing for messages, firmware updates, etc is not optional, regardless of what you would prefer.

In my experience, there&#x27;s a first &quot;wave&quot; of adopters that get to front-run the pack and build momentum. As in, earlier webpages (Maddox) or YouTube acts (Gregory Brothers) rose up when the signal to noise was still pretty good.

As explained in the article, the viewers through the app or through the web enable people to pick an avenue they prefer, and I think that&#x27;s a strength. Periscope reminds me of the fun of ChatRoulette without the hazardous free-for-all setup.<p>With the continually shifting avenues for marketing and performance streaming (Periscope, Tidal, etc) there&#x27;s a lot of opportunity for mid-tier acts to have a chance at a wider audience.

It&#x27;s better than the status quo. It&#x27;s better than what we have today</i><p><i>And by getting the community thinking, by coming together and trying to develop some kind of solution, some kind of standard, we can start developing things that will allow us to build a bridge to the next generation of what we need to protect us against the next generation of coming attacks, and there&#x27;s a lot of things that get in there.

Your diamond analogy is simply inappropriate.<p>We don&#x27;t say &quot;Aircraft grade aluminium costs are like diamonds, rather than hard drive aluminium platters.&quot; or &quot;Fission reactor grade steel costs are like diamonds, rather than...&quot; because this is an immensely silly thing to say that obfuscates the true cost of the material in question.<p>What&#x27;s more, we can generally discover the high end of the <i>true</i> price of the material in question with a little work. As I demonstrated in my replies to you, silicon wafer costs are <i>substantially</i> cheaper than equivalent diamond costs.<p>If you had said something along the lines of &quot;Due in part to the cost of silicon wafers, silicon-based data storage technologies are now and will be for the foreseeable future substantially more expensive on a per-GB basis than spinning rust or tape-based technologies.&quot;, I would have had absolutely nothing at all to object to.<p>> Consider the $0.24/die...<p>That figure is based on a particular die area. I would expect a flash memory die to be substantially smaller than a CPU die. This would drive the base cost per die down even further. Moreover, that figure was from <i>2009</i>. Up to date figures are required to really put a floor on chip prices. :)<p>> And [that 1TB SSD] competes against 5TB hard drives that sells for $100.<p><i>Sort of</i>. For every use that I have except for bulk data storage, I recognize the vast superiority of an SSD. The only HDDs in my computers are the ones I got for free with my laptops-turned-servers that don&#x27;t do much disk IO, and the disk array that holds my 5TB-and-growing Postgres database.<p>For the average computer user, I would strongly recommend replacement of the HDD in their computer with an SSD. If you don&#x27;t need to store more than 1TB of data[0], the performance gains over HDDs are just too great to use anything else.<p>I&#x27;m fairly confident that HDDs will be substantially cheaper per GB than SSDs for the foreseeable future. I&#x27;m -however- not convinced by your implicit argument that SSDs will always be -price-wise- unattractive when compared to HDDs. SSDs seem to be sold at the price-per-GB of the HDDs of ~3->5 years ago. We will <i>inevitably</i> see 500GB SSDs at the $80 retail price point.[1] This will make them a no-brainer for <i>every</i> big computer manufacturer. A really fast disk makes slow kit feel <i>really</i> <i>fucking</i> <i>fast</i>.<p>[0] In my experience, <i>almost</i> no non-technical user has more than 500GB of data that they care about on their machine at any one time.<p>[1] They&#x27;re only a little more than twice that price now.",1439561572

There&#x27;s also lots of tricks like getting a near-zero-down FHA loan, live there for a couple years, then move and turn it into a rental. Anyway, all that is looking at the individual person. If landlords were actually getting outsized returns, you would see outfits with tons of money going into it. There has been some of that, but not a ton, and that has the effect of increasing supply and reducing returns.<p>>>but you are also competing for a rent house from the other 1.2 million Americans that lost there in 2008<p>You seem to be assuming that those houses they lost were bulldozed or something. The amount of vacant housing increased by the exact same amount. Those houses were available for other people to buy (perhaps instead of renting) or to increase the stock of rental housing.<p>>>one landlord decided to go up in price and the others followed because that person was successful in doing so.<p>If there&#x27;s sufficient demand for everyone to raise prices, then it was underpriced before, or demand has increased, or supply has decreased. In any case, that&#x27;s just how markets work - it&#x27;s not the Evil Cabal of Price Fixing Landlords.<p>>>Most renters will stay where they are even if prices go up because moving has large physical, monetary, and opportunity costs.<p>There&#x27;s some inertia there, certainly. But it&#x27;s not at all difficult to shop around and see if your new rent is out of line, so it&#x27;s hard for landlords to get too far beyond the market.<p>Also, contrary to what tenants seem to think, smart landlords don&#x27;t casually kick tenants out. Turnovers are expensive (vacancy, repairs, cleaning), time consuming, and risky (the new tenant could be worse than the old one). Tenants that pay on time, don&#x27;t wreck the house, and don&#x27;t piss off the neighbors are like gold. Smart landlords only raise rents on good tenants when they&#x27;re pretty far below market.
