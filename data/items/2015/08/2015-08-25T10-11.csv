Hence, regulators try to limit the volatility of markets meet their stability preferences. Whether this is ultimately beneficial is an ongoing debate.<p>I would point out that in many cases enforcing artificial stability on markets can have negative outcomes. Recently, the +/-10% limits on daily stock price movements in China created situations where many stocks increased by 10% every day for over 100 days [0]. Such illusions of stability likely played a role in the recent bubble/crash in China. It could be said that attempts to regulate &#x27;stability&#x27; into markets merely leads to a masking of tail risk, which can be very dangerous.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9471858"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9471858</a>",1440499281

It&#x27;s a win win situation for lots of people like me to who wants to live in their country and contribute.<p>2) I live in the capital of my country and it offers better employment opportunities than rest of the country. As a result more people are coming here everyday and now the capital is very much burdened with overpopulation. The rest of the country has more room but underdeveloped. Now the only logical way is to develop the rest of the country at least to some point so that the local people can live there happily. In the development process its not possible to maintain a higher salary for every other people in rest of the country until the market becomes similar to the capital, because the yield and market size is not the same. And its not necessary as well, because better living standard can be ensured there with less money.<p>> because some remote developers are better<p>I&#x27;ve explicitly mentioned that we are considering two developers of same quality. Other developers equal to my caliber living in the US have access to more resources than I have, and I don&#x27;t want to leave my country, so obviously I&#x27;ll take advantage of my lower living cost. Quality doesn&#x27;t have any boundary but opportunity has. Toptal is getting a cut from my payment to find me the opportunity and I don&#x27;t see anything wrong with that :)<p>In any case, I don&#x27;t believe the right way to make someone understand is making an argument. It is only possible by setting an example and evaluating its success. If Toptal can make all the parties happy (their clients, developers and themselves) then they are doing it right despite all the exploit theory you bring on.

Especially with the GPIO library which is as thin as it gets (you can even redefine gpio_get_value, gpio_set_value etc... in the BSP if you want an extra-fast board-specific version). In my experience the overhead is really small actually and it gives you some nice debugging tools (the sysfs interface and debugfs entry in particular).<p>If you implement a GPIO controller driver using the gpiolib means that all other drivers and userland tools will be able to interface with you at no cost. If you write a device driver that uses a GPIO using the gpiolib means that you&#x27;ll be able to use your driver even if the GPIO gets wired on an external I2C &quot;expander&quot; or something like that.<p>Pushing your logic to the extreme one might as well get rid of the kernel and write on bare metal to make sure not to waste any CPU cycle or memory byte on a abstraction layer. What is a kernel in the end if not a set of standardized APIs?<p>It&#x27;s true that there&#x27;s some bloat in a few of the kernel&#x27;s APIs (the video comes to mind, although I won&#x27;t pretend I would be able to do it better) but that shouldn&#x27;t be a reason to &quot;always try to do without having to use all of these APIs&quot;. Unless you only write code that&#x27;s only intended to be used on a particular software configuration on a single board without any possible evolution or reuse it&#x27;s really asking for trouble in the long term.<p>If I have to integrate a third party driver and I see that they use some custom made GPIO interface instead of the standard kernel API I&#x27;m going to be very annoyed.",1440498777
