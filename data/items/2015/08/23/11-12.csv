Once I had the params & responses, I documented them on http://developers.punchh.com/<p>Now, \nthe docs there are 90% correct but sometimes they are out-of-date, wrong or have grammatical/typos in them which I fix but there is little bandwidth. I am wondering if I should outsource this work to technical writer(freelance/contract) to make sure API docs are solid as the will work on it dedicatedly vs my team who&#x27;s primary focus writing code.<p>However, I am still not sure if this a good idea. how do other companies make sure that their API documentation is awesome?

Vermont apparently produces more maple syrup than Ontario [2].<p>Anyway, the majority of maple syrup comes from Quebec, but does it really count as a culinary gift of Canada? Apparently maple syrup is a First Nations&#x27; culinary gift that existed before Europeans settlers arrived [3].<p>On the other hand, recipes for poutine and Nanaimo bars date only as far back as the 1950s, and butter tarts to 1900 (says Wikipedia).

10105294,comment,10103985,10104840,0,0,gozo,,,"It&#x27;s an opinion. It would be very tedious to preface everything with &quot;I think&quot;. It seem very common here to ask that everything be backed up if you don&#x27;t agree with it, but don&#x27;t ask the same thing if you do. Instead of dismissing comments, it would be better to ask for clarification or state why you are disagreeing. Especially as a moderator.<p>The accusation that my comment is &quot;made up&quot; is unfair, not only because it&#x27;s only as made up as any opinion, but because you make that conclusion based on your disagreement with one of my statements. That is a fallacy if anything.<p>My opinions both about copying and commercialization in SV is well founded on texts like &quot;A General History of Silicon Valley&quot; [0]. That China is doing the same thing SV did in the beginning, is based on my experiences in Shenzhen. The example of drones is based on the great interests in drones in the US[1] and the success of DJI[2]. My last opinion is based on conversations I&#x27;ve had with people from SV, who quite often judge China by very different standards than the US. &quot;ageek123&quot; made a fair argument opposing this.<p>If there&#x27;s anything that is frustrating on HN, it&#x27;s not accepting that people have a difference of opinion, background and experiences. Things aren&#x27;t given the benefit of the doubt to the extent they should, but instead downvoted, flagged, spammed into &quot;controversy&quot; or moderated. This creates an environment where discussions end up being about the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;.<p>I also find it somewhat strange that after more than five years on HN with essentially no interaction with moderation, a couple of days after I e-mail about moderation you make this comment which seems more &quot;aggressive&quot; than usual. Instead of things like &quot;makes grand claims without backing them up&quot;, &quot;couldn&#x27;t possibly know such a thing&quot;, &quot;you&#x27;ve made it up&quot;, &quot;wishful thinking&quot;, &quot;not what we&#x27;re looking for&quot; and &quot;cheap shots&quot; how about you either disagree[3] if you disagree or do moderation on point if you&#x27;re doing moderation. &quot;Please substantiate your critic so people have a chance to reply on something other than opinion&quot; seems quite apt. Not that this is a common standard on HN, but at least it would be making HN better.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/sv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scaruffi.com/politics/sv.html</a>\n[1] <a href=""https://hackaday.com/tag/drone/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackaday.com/tag/drone/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/05/06/dji-drones-frank-wang-china-billionaire/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2015/05/06/dji-drones-fr...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a>",1440330686
