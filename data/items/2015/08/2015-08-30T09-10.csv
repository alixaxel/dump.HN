So for the range that you get, you will spend much more time pumping. See the blog-post series above for more on that.<p>> and pay for it exactly the same way I do today<p>Because the infrastructure is many times more expensive than petroleum infrastructure -- and this is not just a matter of relative economies of scale, but a fundamental attribute of hydrogen -- you will need to pay much more to recoup those capital costs. Again, read the blog post series above (I&#x27;ll stop repeating this, but it holds true for every point).<p>> Only it will be clean.<p>Only at your tailpipe, which is a false form of cleanliness. Systemically, Hydrogen is dirty. Hydrogen production is <i>spectacularly</i> inefficient. The only remotely efficient way of producing it is to extract it from hydrocarbons -- in which case it would actually be cleaner to generate work by burning the hydrocarbons directly. Truly &quot;clean&quot; methods of hydrogen production (electrolysis of H2O) require copious amounts of electricity, which must come from somewhere, and again would be better used directly, via a battery-electric vehicle. Basically, any energy source which produces hydrogen could be used to directly power a vehicle, and would be 5x-10x cleaner by doing so.<p>> And I won&#x27;t involving changing my life to fit my car.<p>You have <i>already</i> changed your life to fit your car -- by driving to gas stations! Home-charging is a feature, not a bug.<p>Besides, if you really want to drive to a remote location to get a complete top-up of your range -- that&#x27;s what battery-swap is for. Battery-swap stations are far cheaper to build than hydrogen filling stations, and can give you more range, more quickly, than hydrogen pumping. And they are <i>truly</i> clean, not imaginarily clean.",1440928254

I&#x27;m not making a generalized abstract comparison, I&#x27;m making an energy consumption comparison.<p>When you eat a 10th of a cow per year (200g/day), you consume the same energy as one seat in a Paris-NYC flight, and the same energy as necessary to heat a house for a year, and the same energy as the Earth produces per year, per inhabitant. So, choose only one of those ;)<p>It&#x27;s not about saving tigers, kitties, noise or morality. It&#x27;s that the Earth doesn&#x27;t produce that much energy, so we&#x27;re not in a stable situation on the long term.<p>There are &quot;footprint comparators&quot; that you might have seen on the Internet: A European has a footprint of 2.5, which means it requires 2.5 Earths of wheat fields and uranium mines to feed, cloth and house everyone like a European. It takes 6 Earths to nurture someone like in the US.<p>So we can only sustain this pace of spending resources as long as we keep others poor (aka as long as Middle East/China/Asia don&#x27;t enter into a consumtpion society). That&#x27;s where I claim: We may have to take part with our cars in the future and therefore we&#x27;d better build our cities so that we don&#x27;t need to move around that ton of metal per person.<p>The side effects of emitting CO2, nuclear waste, wars in the Middle East or costing an unsuspected cost through taxes are just different forms of the same constraint, which can be studied through energy consumption in Joules per inhabitant.",1440928103
