However, these developers had a very arrogant attitude towards Docker: They wanted docker changed so that it would follow their design ideas for RHEL and systemd. They often made pull requests with poorly written and undocumented code and then they became very agressive when those pull requests were not accepted, saying &quot;we need this change we will ship a patched version of Docker and cause you problems on RHEL if you don&#x27;t make this change in master.&quot; They were arogant and agressive, when at the same time, they had the choice of working with the Docker developers and writting quality code that could actually be merged.</i><p>THIS. It was both amusing and sad to watch this happen time and time again.

U.S. Department of Energy currently states that there are ~10k public charging stations ( <a href=""http://www.afdc.energy.gov/locator/stations/?fuel=ELEC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.afdc.energy.gov/locator/stations/?fuel=ELEC</a> ). This also doesn&#x27;t even count the many private chargers on commercial property provided by employers to their employees. (ChargePoint&#x27;s commercial network has 20k stations as well.)<p>3) Most people will charge at home and start with 200 miles of range each day vs. filling up a 350 mile range gas tank once a week.<p>4) The cost to install a charger isn&#x27;t excessive: my parents spent about $600 to get an 80 amp breaker outfitted into their 25 year old home. The work was complete in a half day. (When they visit my home, they were able to plug directly into my 240V dryer outlet to recharge.)

That&#x27;s $9600/year. Throw in inexpensive food at another $800/month, and it would be $19,200/year, or a savings of $14,800 per year. Partner with a developer, guarantee the rents, and let the private sector fork over the capital for the building of WAY more than 500 units.<p>A lot of the cost is actually far more than $34k/person, by the way. There are charities that leverage this fact by finding chronic emergency-room users and getting them a home, food, and sometimes a companion animal. [1] When a homeless person checked into a hospital can cost $9000. An emergency room visit can cost $3700. [2] When someone has serious health issues, they can visit the emergency room multiple times a month; some end up costing the taxpayer $44,400 per year.<p>Apparently 90% of the homeless at any one time are just going through a bad spot in their lives. And giving someone a place to live can break the cycle of homelessness: You need to have an address to get a job, typically. You also need to be able to shower. Let them keep living in the cheap apartment if they want, but if their income passes a threshold then they need to start contributing to the room & board.<p>Or don&#x27;t force them to pay; food and shelter really should be human rights anyway.

The survey shows that about 15% of companies (at least for peeps showing up on our site) have some type of containerized application in production. That&#x27;s not a big number.

Looking at you, OpenStack. Yes, things are breaking fast with Docker - I&#x27;ve experienced them myself. Yes, new companies and offerings are joining the ecosystem daily - which can be maddenly confusing for users trying to understand the technologies.

10131482,comment,10129914,10130927,0,0,tbabb,,,"The difference between Reyes and path tracing is this:<p>- Reyes batches camera-visible geometry into grids of micropolygons and microvoxels. These micro-elements are then shaded using any method you please (which, in the case of Pixar movies since Monsters University, has been raytraced physically based illumination). The micropolygons are projected to the image plane and stochastically sampled, much more akin to traditional rasterization. There is no raytracing for camera-visible geometry, and all projections must be linear.<p>This style of doing things was to exploit locality in screen space. It assumes that the image can be broken into &quot;buckets&quot;, and the information outside the bucket can be destroyed when the bucket is finished. This used to be true when RenderMan was first designed, but now that everybody is raytracing their illumination, it is less of a useful optimization.<p>This also means that shading happens at discrete times. Usually everything is shaded at the shutter-open instant, so specular highlights will be smeared in an unphysical way, because their motion is not properly correlated with the geometry motion.<p>I should also point out that Renderman keeps an internal radiosity cache in Reyes mode, which is basically just stored colors of illuminated geometry. This cache is queried by raytracing when computing indirect illumination, and a cache of the whole scene is kept for each bounce. Pixar only uses one or two bounces in Reyes mode due to the heavy memory cost. Note that view-dependent indirect illumination is not possible with this scheme-- Second bounces (and deeper) are always diffuse only. (It is possible to avoid this, but it tends to be slow because Reyes makes all kinds of generally-untrue assumptions about its ability to batch shading which fall apart in second+ bounce shading).<p>- Path tracing fires rays for camera-visible geometry. In most path tracers, including RenderMan RIS, each ray hit generates a new shading exec. This means that time-jittering for camera motion blur also trivially produces time-jittered shading, so (among other things) moving specular highlights will be correct, and view-dependent indirect illumination is possible. Because of this live-shading aspect there is no radiosity cache, and so much deeper levels of indirect illumination bounces can be used (compare 8 bounces to Reyes&#x27; typical 2, for example).<p>Also, because camera-visible geometry is raytraced, it is possible to do interesting things like nonlinear projections.",1440703407

Haskell, OTOH, constructs the entire language around verification through types and pure functions, and everything else is secondary. I don&#x27;t know if the connection to C-H was made later or was a conscious design decision, but the result is the same from the user&#x27;s perspective.<p>> Theorem provers based on C-H are general-purpose logics that can be used for a lot more than just program verification<p>We&#x27;ve discussed this before, and I believe those uses are too niche for the Haskell approach to gain any significant traction.<p>> You can show that, quite literally, any &quot;true property&quot; of a program in your more complicated language is also true of the corresponding program in your simpler language.<p>Of course, but that is only useful if a human programmer writing in the more &quot;complicated&quot; (by your definition) language would use the &quot;simpler&quot; subset, which, by my definition, she wouldn&#x27;t do.<p>> There&#x27;s no need to solve the much, much harder (and poorly specified) problem of &quot;what is easiest for humans&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s not a mathematical problem with a clear solution, and therefore requires no robust specification -- just like architecture (of buildings), or any other UI design problem. We learn what works through trial and error and try to do better.<p>I find it hard to accept the point of view which considers UI to be a methematical puzzle, or, alternatively, that doesn&#x27;t recognize programming languages as UIs.<p>> but that&#x27;s an entirely different problem independent of semantic considerations.<p>From a UI design perspective, you can&#x27;t separate the two, because if the user fails to interact with the machine well, you don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a matter of design or presentation unless you empirically test it.",1440702826

10131423,comment,10129875,10131295,0,0,mikeash,,,"OK, then add &quot;and take reasonable breaks&quot; to the amendment.<p>Stopping for 20-30 minutes every 150 miles or so isn&#x27;t a burden for most people. Some people really like to push. But you really <i>should</i> be stopping that long, that often, regardless of what you&#x27;re driving. People don&#x27;t always do it, but they should.<p>As I mentioned in a comment elsewhere, the impact of charging time really depends on what you do in that time. If you can time your charging to coincide with a meal, for example, then the actual penalty from charging is zero. If you&#x27;re doing a 400 mile road trip and you can make your supercharging stop your lunch stop, then you&#x27;ll lose less time to charging than you&#x27;d lose to filling the tank of a gas car. Obviously that&#x27;s a big if and it&#x27;s not at all guaranteed, but the point is that this isn&#x27;t an absolute, and &quot;30 minutes to charge&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be thought of as being the equivalent of &quot;30 minutes to fill the gas tank.&quot;<p>Personally I love long trips in the Model S. Part of that is just because the car is extremely comfortable and easy to drive, which makes long trips much less tiring. I&#x27;m sure that would come with other cars in that price range too, so not something that&#x27;s exclusive to Tesla. The extra charging time has not so far been at all an issue. I&#x27;ve made three trips beyond the range of the car in the six months I&#x27;ve had it, and my total time spent waiting for the car to charge is zero. I&#x27;m sure that will start to become non-zero when I want to do, say, 500 miles in a day, but I still look forward to longer trips in it more than I did in my previous cars.",1440702756
