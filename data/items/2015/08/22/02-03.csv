My favorite pet example of this is MS versus Apple - the former has historically cared deeply about being backwards compatible, while the latter has gone through several hardware and software architecture changes that have required total rewrites from third-party developers.<p>The situation with Firefox is a little trickier, staying backwards-compatible for <i>web content</i> has always been an important goal, but anything living inside the <i>browser chrome</i> does not get the same assurances.<p>Right now extensions live somewhere between these two worlds, and we&#x27;ve had over a decade of experience with them so I think it&#x27;s time to carve out their own space, with dependable APIs that are more stable than the internal browser APIs, but faster-moving and more privileged than the web.",1440212378

However, past a baseline threshold for human survival it&#x27;s argued that a person&#x27;s subjective perception of well-being is relative to that of others around him. Objectively, we are many times better off than we were pre-industrialization in almost every way imaginable, but does that make us many times happier or more satisfied than people who are unaware of such a standard of living? The argument is that they would perceive their well-being as much worse if they were aware, even if nothing has objectively changed.",1440212375

The main problem is there aren&#x27;t many in widespread use, and they tend to be quite specialized, so you might not find one which you&#x27;re completely happy with.<p>2. Programs, or rather functions/procedures/subroutines should, with very few exceptions, be displayable on a single screen.   If they are larger, they should be split up.   This applies whether the language is textual or graphical.   Moving graphics around should make no difference to how a dataflow program executes.<p>3. Yes, it&#x27;s easier to develop a new text-based language, because so much research has been done on them, and you don&#x27;t need to develop an editor along with the language.   But there are hundreds in active use, which are constantly evolving.   If you want a new set of features, you can add it to an existing language or create your own dialect.   Visual code must have either a text or binary representation of the source which can be shared.   It may not be human-readable but that&#x27;s not the intention.",1440211694

What killed it for me was that for all the fun abstractions, they were so isolated in their own environment and disconnected from the operating system that it was not apparent how you would use them for anything real. Processing files, connecting to databases and other network resources, and interacting with the user are core practical services that need to be front and center to get new users to connect to your language, but if those elements are ghettoized into awkward libraries that don&#x27;t work as elegantly as the abstract parts of the language then you aren&#x27;t going to get traction, except for very specialized purposes.",1440211679

(Dataflow algorithms are directed graphs, with data flowing along edges between vertices, each of which contains a single processing step.)   This is because dataflow captures all the parallelism inherent in the algorithm without the programmer having to assign tasks to processors explicitly.   While text-based dataflow languages exist, the directed graphs which comprise dataflow programs are more naturally represented graphically.<p>Having started down the dataflow route, further advantages then manifest themselves: most program development can be done by drag and drop, rather than typing; strong type checking can be done while edges are being drawn; the directed graphs used to draw code can double as completely general data structures; and the graphics libraries used to develop the language can be made available to the programmer.<p>The visual dataflow programming language I am developing is described here: <a href=""http://web.onetel.com/~hibou/fmj/FMJ.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.onetel.com/~hibou/fmj/FMJ.html</a><p>Some visual languages, such as DRAKON and GRAIL, are based on conventional flowcharts showing flow of control, rather than flow of data.

No thanks. I&#x27;ve taken the bus numerous times in LA out of necessity, usually when my bike unexpectedly broke or I was just too tired to ride home, and it always sucks. I avoid it at all costs.<p>The subways are better, but not by much. They&#x27;re still insanely crowded during peak hours and not really any faster than driving when you factor in the time and effort it takes to get to and from the stations themselves. However, I&#x27;d take the subway downtown more often if it just ran later.",1440209153

In 2 weeks I&#x27;ll be visiting my family for a few months and I&#x27;ll be constantly working from home, so I thought it may be worth investing into an external display. I&#x27;ll be there for 3-4 months and I won&#x27;t be able to take it with me afterwards so I don&#x27;t want to spend too much - less than $1k and ideally less than $500.<p>1. Should I buy one of those 4K monitors? Are they worth it for development? Any experiences?<p>2. Should I buy a &quot;standard&quot; 1080p monitor? Should I buy two of those instead of a 4K?<p>3. Should I save the money and just keep working on my laptop like I&#x27;ve been all along?<p>Any experiences are appreciated.",1440209078
