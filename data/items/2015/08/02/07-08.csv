If I escalated or presented work to them, they would categorize it as a &quot;career&quot;, &quot;hobby&quot; or &quot;skill development&quot; and position it relative to their preferred activities in a way which induced anxiety and discouraged me from continuing. The only thing I wanted was basic interest or acknowledgement, and they consistently messed that up by wheeling every conversation directly towards their comfort zone. To this day, if I try to talk about a personal issue, they rush to provide unsolicited solutions and explanations. I finally managed to unlearn the explaining pattern myself as I got into my later 20&#x27;s, as my friends brought it to light.<p>So, at least at that time, I gave up on parental engagement and hid my life away in the computer instead, since at least there were people online, while weathering the (relatively mild, compared with others) storms of their own fancy. So too, I think, is the role of all of today&#x27;s devices - when the family doesn&#x27;t care, the screen fills in. It&#x27;s a symptom.<p>I think it&#x27;s right to set down rules at an early age. That is one thing I think my parents did do right, and the early years are probably more crucial overall. But they had no idea how to proceed from there - kids aren&#x27;t going to be exactly like their parents, and that requires a lot of listening when they get into adolescence and try to speak for themselves.",1438501749

We applied Assay\nof Transposase Accessible Chromatin with sequenc-\ning (ATAC-seq) to map chromatin accessibility in pri-\nmary CD4+ T cells isolated from standard blood\ndraws from 12 healthy volunteers over time, from\ncancer patients, and during T-cell activation. Over\n4,000 predicted regulatory elements (7.2%) showed\nreproducible variation in accessibility between indi-\nviduals. Gender was the most significant attributable\nsource of variation.&quot;<p>A sample size of 12 is small, but makes sense since this is a new technique which enables researchers to identify personal variations in accessible chromatin landscape in\nhuman T cells and trace their genetic, epigenetic, and disease associations.  In exploratory experimental science of this sort, sample size is not really a relevant measure.<p>But, even with the small sample size, the results were interesting.  In particular, this new technique demonstrates that there are significant differences in the genetic structure of the immune system, which appear to be sex linked. That is not a sexist statement, it is a fact.",1438499349

Getting incredibly lonely in a foreign city where I don&#x27;t speak the language and have no friends or coworkers, I was forced out into the wild to get to know people through any means possible. It was important for me to learn to connect quickly and deeply with people to have meaningful relationships fast enough to provide me any value before I moved on from that city to the next (about 2-3 months).<p>I was terrible at it for the first 2 cities I went to, but by the 5th I was surprising myself.",1438499215
