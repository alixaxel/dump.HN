First we take away street parking and left turns. Then we take away stopping / idling. Then we make carpool / high occupancy vehicle lanes and bike lanes. Then we convert lanes into transit lanes only. Then we completely prohibit cars / motored deliveries during rush hour.

An OAP with limited mobility will always require assistance day-to-day, and it&#x27;s the sort of thing robots are really bad at. OAPs are also growing in number, as life expectation increases. Another one: you will always need someone to help give birth - in fact, as hospitals are deemed too expensive and scaled back, we will likely need more nurses, since home-births stop them from sharing their time between patients. Again, this will not be touched by automation. I&#x27;m sure there are plenty of other examples.<p><i>>2. How much more can they grow ?</i><p>I think that&#x27;s more a function of our social organisation than technology. The real question is basically &quot;how can we pay these people?&quot; -- morality and common sense tell us that a lot of these activities should not be linked to profit, but that is economically challenging unless we rethink how money is created and distributed.<p><i>> We&#x27;re talking about 40% of jobs at risk due to automation in 20 years.</i><p>I find that number too high to be true. 10 or 20%, maybe; 40%, it&#x27;s really hard to believe - that&#x27;s 15 million people in the UK without a job, where currently we have 2.3million unemployed. It would mean basically 1 million newly unemployed people each year; I would argue society would not survive 5 years in such conditions, let alone 20.<p>In any case, I have no doubt we can create more office-based bullshit roles to offset the bulk of those losses (dedicated entertainment people in every office; corporate psychologists; continuous-change oversight; dedicated corporate tailors; and so on and so forth...).",1439894896

What standards are there for voting machines in the US?<p>A couple of years ago, a Dutch group of hackers (led by Rop Gongrijp) argued very strongly against the use of any kind of voting machine. Not because they&#x27;re so easily hacked (I assume the Dutch voting machines were fairly secure), but simply because they&#x27;re a black box and you simply have to trust that whatever comes out is correct, and there&#x27;s no paper trail you can verify to check whether it actually is correct. If they&#x27;ve been tampered with, you most likely don&#x27;t know, and even if you do know, there&#x27;s no way to correct it.<p>Netherland has very specific voting laws to ensure that elections are reliable and verifiable, and when voting computers were introduced, an exemption was added to the law because voting computers couldn&#x27;t possibly meet those rules.<p>The hackers successfully argued their case, so we&#x27;re back to voting with pencils again.

Most major metropolis and almost all US ones are designed mostly if not solely for cars, banning cars requires significant improvements to the transportation infrastructure in general, both adding public transport and making existing ways more walkable and cyclable. Even in non-US cities the transition tends to be rocky (e.g. I believe Paris is progressively making the inner city less drivable and further improving public transport, the transition phase is no fun as driving becomes very tough but not-driving is not a great option).<p>You also have to figure out stuff like deliveries and garbage collection, which generally require trucks going through.<p>But some cities are planning it, Hamburg is trying to become car-free within 20 years for instance. Freiburg also has the &quot;pilot&quot; district of Vauban which was laid out with peripheral car parks (owners must buy a parking spot or sign a declaration of no car ownership) and following filtered permeability (the further in you go the less convenient cars become, and the more convenient walking or cycling).
