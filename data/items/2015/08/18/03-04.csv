And it&#x27;s still too early to say anything about Overwatch.<p>I wholeheartedly agree that Blizzard has not made one bad game yet. On the other hand, we don&#x27;t need to hype up their success: several of their recent games have been kind of a ... flop, notably Diablo 3 and Starcraft 2. Both had really good sales on release (not necessary great on Blizzard scale), but the longevity is definitely nowhere near the long time plan they originally have. Starcraft 2 was supposed to become the king of Esport, yet LOL took the charge and firmly stay on top with a significant gap. Diablo 3 Real-money Auction house has to be shut down, and even the mighty WOW lost more than 3 millions subscribers in the last 2 quarters. Hearthstone, however is indeed an amazing success.<p>World of Warcraft is especially an interesting case, seeing that all the 2nd most popular MMO has never came anywhere near the popularity of WoW, it&#x27;s questionable whether MMO is an actually viable genre in the long run. Note that most other MMO in 2nd place come and go in waves, never lasting more than a few months to a year. The one with the most consistent number of subscribers (and growing) is Eve online, which is firmly in a niche and does not even have 10% of wow players.",1439870375

I had a few games lost to server issues, but they always refunded the entry fees whenever that happened and they let you keep any prizes you won, too.  The stability has improved quite a bit over the past couple of years, too, to the point where now the only problem I ever really have is wireless blips causing needless disconnects (do some retries on a timeout, folks!).<p>There was one day where v4 was down, so I got v3 to try to keep playing.  For all the people saying v4 is a step down, I want a hit of whatever it is you are on.  v3 seemed worse than apprentice, which I am pretty sure I played on windows 95 when it first came out.  I think the commentary on features/UI is almost completely dominated by people who are curmudgeonly and view any change as bad.

One example cited in the article says that for almonds, 129 calories were absorbed out of the 170 listed on the label. That&#x27;s a 25% difference. The article unfortunately doesn&#x27;t give a whole lot more info on how this tracks across various foods under various methods of preparation, but it would seem to me that if this difference is highly variable, it basically defeats the idea of fungibility of &quot;label calories&quot;, which seems to me to be the entire point of listing them in the first place. Granted, if you&#x27;re basically eating the same stuff, but just increasing or decreasing helpings, that&#x27;s not such an issue.<p>People might disagree with my reasoning here, but I&#x27;m not really seeing how I deserve downvotes.",1439869800

I had this experience.<p>It really works to establish this before you get married.<p>Since the journey you are on, as you say, it really works when your life partner buys into your vision.<p>You are going to be making choices about how to work, when to work, and with regard to the current burn rate of your life, and with regard to the value of future pay offs, that are vitally important for people in a relationship to agree on. If your partner doesn&#x27;t share your passion for this, or believe in you, how are they going to come on that journey with you? Will they be there for you and support you when you and your business need that?<p>Will they give you the extra runway by getting a job, or will they insist you chuck it in and get a job?<p>I mean, having a business is a lot of ways like having a baby, you are always working on it, and everything changes around doing it. And it really works for your partner and you to carry that weight together.<p>No one knows what&#x27;s going to happen, it could all work out. Maybe it&#x27;s simply differences in expectations that can be reconciled through communication. Or maybe it&#x27;s something more fundamental. At this stage tho, you don&#x27;t know.<p>My choice was to cut my losses quickly when it seemed like it wasn&#x27;t working. I would caution against that, since I feel that the marriage is an asset, because of your commitment to each other. When you got married, didn&#x27;t you vow to be there for each other, through sickness and health, and failure and success? So my recommendation after trying the opposite ( and it not working ) is just stick it out. Try to make it work, because that relationship could be so important to you if it maintains.<p>In my case, we divorced. Not, mind you, just because of a business. There&#x27;s always a mix of things, and both people are responsible. I think the main thing was simply not really emphatically communicating about what our expectations were, and also not really being so committed to sticking it out, we both chose to cut our losses. Well, at least we had the same efficient mind! Still I believe through lack of communication and commitment we didn&#x27;t quite work out exactly what it could have been. So persistence, could really be key.<p>Later I found someone who really did buy into my vision, and support me while working on the project. Objectively this person is far more compatible with doing this startup, tho the truth is, you never know how things could have been different, had you done them differently.<p>As other posters suggested -- maybe get some husband time to yourself, away from the wife and kid, cafe working, or cave working, or shed working, some time and place to be around other people who do share your vision. I think that idea of community really helps. Why? Because in a way you are asking your wife to be your community if you don&#x27;t get out there and rely on others as a community. And being around the energy of others can really refresh you and give you that mental reset so when you come home, it&#x27;s like a delineated time, and you&#x27;re all ready to go husband and daddy mode again.<p>It is a scary time. Maybe rethink feeling ashamed, tho. You&#x27;re trying to juggle doing a lot of things. You&#x27;re not doing anything wrong -- you&#x27;re just trying to make it work. That&#x27;s noble, not shameful.",1439869746

10077501,comment,10077222,10077222,0,0,stevecalifornia,,,"My friend and I spent about 5 years making an online collectible card game.   We started around 2003, around the same time that MTG was reporting scaling issues.  Their scale issues inspired me to architect a game server that was horizontally scalable-- theoretically infinitely.<p>Our game, from the start, was built to: 1) playable from the web with no client (1mb flash, I suppose) 2) bi-directional socket based to avoid polling and be snappy 3) server is scalable horizontally 4) adding complex cards and rules will not require a client update and would be easy.<p>We managed to complete all these goals and produce what I still consider to be our magnum opus of software development.<p>The scaling worked by having socket servers provide the end-point to the client, and then behind the socket servers were chat services, game services, trading services, card building services and deck services.  So, lets say we had 4 socket servers running: you and I might end up on different socket servers, but we could still play against each other because all the socket servers are doing is relaying your commands to a game server that is running our game.  In order to scale, we just add more servers.  (Also, if we get disconnected you can reconnect easily.  Also, spectating is easy.)<p>My friend came up with the idea of making the Flash front-end use generic commands.  So instead of the server telling the front-end &quot;Ship A attacks Ship B for 5 damage&quot; it says &quot;Draw a red arrow from Card #123 to Card #456 and display a red number 5&quot;.  This allowed us to make cards that did all kinds of crazy things without having to do anything to the client.  To implement a card that does damage to all of a player&#x27;s ships you just have to update the server to send the command &quot;Draw a red arrow from Card #123 to Card #456, Card #789, etc...&quot;.<p>Finally, the core game engine on the server was an event loop.  Thus, making new cards and rules was super easy because all you had to do in code was say &quot;I want this new card to subscribe to the Player Draw Card event, and in that event code: &quot;if drawer is this.owner, draw twice the amount as regular and then this.sendtograve.&quot;  I was continually blown away by what crazy cards we could make up and how little code it took to implement.<p>As we were creating this game our day jobs became more and more serious and when we finally had the final version complete we both agreed to burn the code and resources to DVD and put it on the shelve.  The idea of starting a new journey in marketing and building a company was overwhelming.  (Just three months ago I got it all running in the cloud with very little effort for nostalgias sake).<p>I still think about pinging WOTC and asking if they&#x27;d like to see what we have and maybe make use of it.  I knew WOTC had an online version of MOTG but I had NO idea it had so many rough patches or I would have been down in front of their office with a sign asking them to look at what we have.<p>If anyone from WOTC or other would like to see or talk about the game, feel free to message me.",1439869444

Learn Java and becoming an Android Developer.<p>But maybe you want to do a web stack.  You generally want some experience on the back and and the front end.  When in your learning, you don&#x27;t know what to use out of a bunch of tools, pick what is most widely used, and if it&#x27;s a tie, go with the older thing, or the simpler thing.<p>You will be learning Javascript, as well as HTML and CSS for the front end dev work, so for the back end Node.js, which is a server side javascript platform, is a good thing to learn. Express is one framework, but it&#x27;s most popular, and you want to pick up a popular stack.<p>Like Python?  Learn Django.  If the company you want to work for uses a microframework like Flask or something, they will still probably hire Django devs, but the opposite may not be true.<p>Like Ruby?  Ruby on Rails isn&#x27;t the only framework, but it&#x27;s super popular, and you want to get the skills, right?<p>Learn to use the command line (Mac, Linux, or cygwin if you have to stay on windows) to do things.  Sign up for Amazon&#x27;s free 1 year of cloud services, so you can practice setting up stuff over ssh and using git.<p>Learn git, enough to be able to put projects up on github, and to get them down onto your server.<p>In terms of front end, learn enough jquery to interact with a REST API and get data from it into your app.  Consider a front end framework like angular.  Learn bootstrap, which is a CSS framework, because again, its popular.<p>It&#x27;s not necessary to understand big O or data structures in detail for a startup job, but it might be to get hired. Knowing SQL is probably helpful eventually, but don&#x27;t worry if you don&#x27;t.<p>Why do I keep telling you to pick the popular thing?  Because startups want people who may not know the stack, but know how to use a stack and accomplish something.  You can get hired to do android dev knowing only IOS, or ruby on rails knowing django, or using react and backbone when you know angular.<p>Learning to program is hard.

But this, rather than convincing them that they hadn&#x27;t a clue how to write or operate MTGO, instead convinced them that they needed to double down.  For version 3, they decided rewrite the entire thing from scratch.  Sort of an unholy amalgamation of second-system effect, NIH syndrome, and the coding skills you&#x27;d expect from a company that had never made a computer game before.<p>Version 3 was hugely delayed, hugely overbudget, and...well...utter, utter crap.  The UI was worse, many features were lost, performance was bad, stability was terrible; there was literally no advantage over version 2.  It took them 5 years to launch it, more to make it playable, and when it was done, it was so bad I stopped player literally because I couldn&#x27;t stand the client any more.<p>Apparently there&#x27;s a version 4 now, but it&#x27;s basically just 3.1; they didn&#x27;t fix any of the core issues.  If they could bring back something that looked and worked like version 2, I might start playing again, but really, every version they released was some form of pathetically bad.  There&#x27;s literally a half dozen half-assed shareware deck builders from 15 years ago that had better UIs than any MTGO client has ever had.  :(<p>Even before Hearthstone, I used to wonder what might have been if Wizards had signed a deal with a &quot;real&quot; developer like Blizzard to build and run the game properly.  With the launch of Hearthstone, I think we know.  Oh well.",1439867359
