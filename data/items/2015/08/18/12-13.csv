10078922,comment,10078321,10078526,0,0,enraged_camel,,,"Yes, exactly. Mentorship is about <i>guidance</i>, not hand-holding. It is about asking questions the inexperienced employee may not have thought of on their own, but also letting them find the optimal solution on their own.<p>For example, if they are designing a backup solution for the first time, asking them &quot;what will the system do if the backup media is full?&quot; is good. Telling them what it <i>should</i> do when full is bad. By asking the question, you&#x27;re basically teaching them that there should be a contingency in case of failure. From there, a discussion on possible solutions can take place, where the mentor once again guides the employee to figure out the pros and cons of each approach.<p>That said, I&#x27;d never knowingly let people fail. Even without that, any good professional will have plenty of failures anyway. If they don&#x27;t, they are playing it too safe and aren&#x27;t learning some important lessons, and it might be time to assign them more challenging projects.",1439902678

That’s kind of hard to figure out.<p>However, the micro level version of the fallacy is, I think, not a fallacy at all, but very much true and can be disastrous for a great many individuals: “Labour-saving technologies increase unemployment <i>among people with my qualifications</i> by reducing demand for labour <i>for people with my qualifications</i>.” (The consequence may not be unemployment. The affected people more or less only qualify for jobs where no qualifications are necessary, probably leading to unemployment for some, a reduction in income for others.)<p>Put another way, while the labour market in general may be left intact, the effect on specific individuals may be disastrous. In that context luddites smashing up machines may be entirely rational for them personally, because even though the industrial revolution lifted large swathes of humanity out of poverty (eventually), along the way many individuals had to suffer greatly and it didn’t get better for them personally until they died. Maybe it got better for their kids or grandkids.<p>That’s one reason why thinking about macro level effects is not enough (but there may also be better solutions than smashing up machines, i.e. it may well be possible to get the positive macro level effects over longer time scales while also, through other means, reducing or eliminating poverty or suffering on a micro level).",1439901491

Some people do use stack-based genetic programming, so it would be fun to hook this up to one of those systems and evolve textures.<p>One nice feature in the above strand of research is that the output value, instead of being mapped to a greyscale, is mapped via a colour map to produce colour images.",1439901179

I mean, outside schools, that’s called collaboration.<p>I don&#x27;t think cheating is the big picture problem. I think it&#x27;s how we think of are tests. Imagine a test designed in such a way that you couldn&#x27;t cheat - or even that collaboration was ok - what would it look like? Could it be an open note/open book test?<p>The way I give tests to my students is open book/open note but not open neighbor. I do this because I&#x27;m realistic - memorization is not comprehension and whatever they did memorize will be lost 5 minutes after class ends (they have N other subjects that they need to memorize material for - even though I teach a core class they have much more important things to worry about). My tests are long and short answer but not hard - so if you have been comatose for the lectures you won&#x27;t do well (I have had people fail my tests...). Some teachers have the one notecard rule and think that they are clever tricking the students to memorize the material - they aren&#x27;t. You may retain some more information - but it&#x27;s still the core of the problem memorization != comprehension.<p>Yes I understand some fields do require memorization - such as history or the medical profession. But people don&#x27;t need to memorize the bubble sort or the binary search algorithms - it&#x27;s been done a million times and if anyone ever needed it for their career a quick google search would reveal this site [2]. Yes they need to understand it - but they don&#x27;t need to memorize it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://edtechnow.net/2012/01/20/sir-ken-robinson/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edtechnow.net/2012/01/20/sir-ken-robinson/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Binary_search"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Binary_search</a>",1439900599

That&#x27;s where I really began to struggle and start noticing shortcomings in my play. When I started working through Complete Modern Drum Set, which probably increased my proficiency on the set more than any other book, is when I really started to notice how much I struggled with it. A lot of that stuff wasn&#x27;t that difficult to pick up -- the linear patterns, time signature changes, playing off the beat, etc. But through in some odd hi-hat work and I just fell apart.<p>I never really struggled with some of the other stuff you mention though. Rudiments, keeping time, understanding tempos, and how notes break down, etc. That stuff came relatively naturally.

Honor systems don&#x27;t work and many of my professors didn&#x27;t care.<p>Very few people talk about what it feels like not to cheat and why students do it. So here goes:<p>I made it through college without cheating. My university actually managed to scare me from doing so with freshmen orientation. I focused on studying and making sure I took advantage of walk-in hours and student teachers. For a while I thought everyone was doing this. Then, as weeks passed in each semester the students got more and more brazen. During my years of school I was outright asked to share my test (sometimes during a test), I was offered payment and I was made to feel ostracized when I didn’t “help”. It sucked.<p>The worst part came when I would meet other honors students and find out how they got their high scores. I was surprised at how many of them cheated, to what degree they would cheat and how little they knew about their course work. This is when I found that there was no incentive not to cheat. Honors students got scholarships and were often given some very good internship opportunities.<p>Why would anyone not cheat? No one cares if you do. You’ll have an easier time. It doesn’t hurt your career. It also does wonders for your social life. My final two years I pretended to have low scores on tests so as not to be asked to help cheat. I kept my grades a secret and would often not look at graded papers in class.  I stopped talking about any of my classes with anyone that was in my major.",1439899525
