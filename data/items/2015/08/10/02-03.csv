10032447,comment,10031286,10031805,0,0,superuser2,,,">Ideally, it is intended to work like a machine with as little room for human discretion as possible<p>Actually, these laws are the most dystopian.<p>One concept that seems to have this design goal is strict liability: what you intended, what you believed, what elaborate conspiracies were created to deceive you, none of that matters. If you did it, you are guilty and will be punished, full stop. This is attractive because it&#x27;s much harder to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that someone did something &quot;with malice&quot; or &quot;intentionally&quot; than to prove that they did it. This tends to show up around youth sexuality, probably because that&#x27;s an area where social norms have changed quite a bit.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if the 17.5-year-old you slept with presented a fake ID saying she was 18, took the lead in all sexual activity, etc. It doesn&#x27;t matter if she shows up in court and begs the judge to let you go. People whose 18th birthday has not elapsed cannot give consent, full stop. Sex without consent is rape, rapists are bad people and should be made to suffer, so you&#x27;re going to prison and then on to the sex offender registry. Your judge, and the judges you appeal to, all think this is ridiculous, but their hands are tied because the law was written like a computer program that failed to consider edge cases. (Literally edge cases - those that fall near numerical boundaries. Some states have patched their legal systems to allow consent between partners who are close in age but under the normal age of consent. Some have, but only for heterosexual couples. Some still haven&#x27;t. My state actually tried and convicted two teenagers as adults for raping each other at the same time.)<p>Same with child porn. Child porn laws were created a time when taking and distributing a picture could only be part of a commercial publishing operation. Anyone who creates or possesses an image of a nude child is guilty of a child pornography offense. Seems reasonable. Now every teenager has an internet-connected camera in their process, and we found an edge case we forgot: the child pornographer is the child him/herself and the consumer is her long-term boyfriend, also underage. Still just as illegal and the same punishment is required. You would hope prosecutors would turn a blind eye, but &quot;the law is the law.&quot;<p>These rather salacious examples are the most high-profile, but I&#x27;m sure the same problems happens in more mundane areas of law as well.<p>At some point you have to trust judges and you have to empower bureaucrats to help people get out of obviously ridiculous situations. Laws are much more difficult to change than computer programs; there needs to be a reasonable amount of discretion for a manual override until the law can be fixed.",1439175495

We work with EM neuron images, we have a DNN trained on image patches that are quite small as the training cost is quite high. If I recall correctly, it was trained for months using 7x7x7 patches on several 100^3 voxel volumes. The output of the network was fractured, and at the time it was the best we could do. However, humans, because we can see the bigger picture, bigger than 7x7 patches on 2D image displays at a time, we can resolve the splits in the image segmentation that the AI is bluntly unable to. It&#x27;s worth noting that my lab uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) not recurrent neural networks (RNNs).<p>It seems to me that this is a technical problem of being able to train and run a large enough network to approach human abilities in pattern recognition.

Sugar by itself isn&#x27;t too different from what your body easily converts into sugars (that being all carbs besides fiber), and glycemic index/load values for foods vary a lot.<p>My point is that what is advertised, subsidized and promoted by the government is lopsided from what&#x27;s really ideal.  The food industry is both part of the problem and responding to consumer demand.  As to my body telling me something, that&#x27;s another point.... That being that not everyone notices or feels the affect as significantly even though it&#x27;s there.<p>It&#x27;s not just sugar, it having too much starch/grains in our diet as well... mostly the heavily refined foods.  People are also mislead into believing that some things are healthier when they really aren&#x27;t... fruit snacks, smoothies, etc are just about as bad as the sugary stuff, or worse if you consider the deceptive marketing.<p>I don&#x27;t think we should, as a society, ban any given food, but the marketing allowed, and the information distributed in education really needs to change.",1439172292

It&#x27;s not directly related to the size of the blockchain.<p><i>- I thought bitcoin was supposed to be decentralised – doesn’t a group of centralised developers have the ability to change everything about the currency?</i><p>It is decentralized.

It might be a choice to you and I, but by definition we aren&#x27;t addicts. Just like with alcohol or sex, we can do it without the need or drive to OVER do it, addicts cannot...<p>I do find in recent years and completely against all evidence, bigotry has come out strongly against people struggling with food addiction.
