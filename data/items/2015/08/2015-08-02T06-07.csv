9990030,comment,9989554,9989699,0,0,PhasmaFelis,,,"There was a wonderful story I read 15 or 20 years ago and unfortunately can&#x27;t find a source for now, that went something like this: Some random entrepreneur had made a bunch of money by buying textile plants and streamlining them, eliminating inefficiencies, canning redundant workers, so on and so forth. Flush with success, he decided he wanted to branch out into other industries that weren&#x27;t making enough money and needed to hear his gospel of efficiency, and bought a bunch of fiction publishing houses. He quickly discovered that he couldn&#x27;t do shit with them, because publishing is a business with razor-edge margins, and the publishers that weren&#x27;t run with machine-like precision had all gone out of business already.<p>If you want to &quot;disrupt&quot; the airline business, invent anti-gravity.

It&#x27;s not the only way of doing it. Disney most likely uses path tracing with next event estimation. This means that they start a path as explained in the video and they end a path by sampling a point on a light and then connecting the start of the path with the point to form a full path. This is one the techniques used by bidirectional path tracing (bdpt), this technique uses n vertices on the camera path and 1 vertex on the light path, but bdpt also uses techniques with s vertices on the camera path and t vertices on the light path. This means that there are multiple ways to sample the same path, so these techniques need to be weighted using something called Multiple Importance Sampling.",1438497992

Basically what we want to solve is a path integral (an integral over all paths), we do this using a technique called Monte Carlo integration (which basically means we use randomness). We first sample a path (using path tracing) and then we calculate the contribution of that path (which basically is the amount of radiance is carries divided by the probability of sampling the path) and then we add that contribution to the right pixel.",1438497604

9989985,comment,9988073,9989349,0,0,solidangle,,,"No that&#x27;s wrong. You do start tracing paths at the camera. The lens usually is extremely small and the rays that do contribute are highly directional, the probability of hitting the lens is extremely low and the probability of the hitting the lens in a direction that actually contributes to the final image is even lower. On the other hand there usually are many lights in a scene with a total area that&#x27;s much larger than the area of lens and most lights don&#x27;t have a directional profile. So you&#x27;re much more likely to hit a light than you are to hit the lens, hence we start at the camera and not at a light.<p>They do simplify things a bit though. Normally we don&#x27;t trace one path at a time, but we trace multiple of them. Each time we intersect with an object we do not only create another ray to continue to path, but we also sample a point on a light and we connect the two points by a ray to finish the path.

Lambda, and extension are the best features. You can design your API interface in the most expressive way. It help makes communication between objects much much easier.<p>For Android development, it is even sweeter, who likes keep using `findViewById()`. Kotlin-Android-Extension does that automagically.<p>I even write my own HTTP lib for Android entirely in Kotlin.

We carried binary groups and offered pretty good retention/completion but by then even the pirates had mostly ditched NNTP for torrents. At the time we estimated that we had maybe about a dozen customers accessing the server for non-binary / piracy use.<p>Going back further to why NNTP became irrelevant for discussion I&#x27;d say it was a combination of difficult setup for the average user and the lack of good free NNTP clients. Early web forums could offer discussion for free without the difficulty / expense of a NNTP client. As NNTP groups became more insular the miserable trolls were able to take over and ruin it for everyone. Almost every group I was active in during the late 90s deteriorated in this way. Just one mentally ill and/or very lonely person posting 50+ times per day could very effectively destroy a group.",1438496426
