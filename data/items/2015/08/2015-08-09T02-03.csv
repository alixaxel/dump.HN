10029303,comment,10028861,10028861,0,0,ketralnis,,,"If you use Python for anything remotely performance sensitive, I highly recommend giving Cython a shot. The trick is to find your computation-intensive inner loop stuff, move it off to its own module, add types, and go. It makes your build a little more complicated (i.e. most Python projects have no build process at all) but if you&#x27;re in the niche where it&#x27;s useful, it&#x27;s damned useful.<p>Here what it does. Take a look at this Python code:<p><pre><code>    import math
    def distance(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        return math.sqrt((y2-y1)**2+(x2-x1)**2)
</code></pre>
It looks simple, but it&#x27;s doing a lot behind the scenes. It respects __sub__/__add__ metamethods, respects and promotes between floats/longs/ints and even Bignums, it has to do a __getattr__ on the `math` object to find the sqrt function in the first place, etc (and can&#x27;t cache that because this is Python so you may have changed it in between calls). After every one of these calls, a Python exception is checked for, and many reference counts are incremented and decremented. Every now and then, the interpreter checks to see if it&#x27;s time to release/reacquire the GIL and if any OS signals have come in. And it does all of this by compiling Python to bytecode and running that through its interpreter.<p>Here&#x27;s the same code in Cython:<p><pre><code>    from libc.math cimport sqrt
    cdef double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2):
        return sqrt((y2-y1)**2+(x2-x1)**2)
</code></pre>
Cython takes that code and compiles it to this C code (a bit simplified):<p><pre><code>    #include <math.h>
    double distance(double x1, double y1, double x2, double y2) {
        double a = y2-y1;
        double b = x2-x1;
        return sqrt(a*a+b*b)
    }
</code></pre>
So now instead of running through dozens of intermediate internal Python functions, you&#x27;re just loading the numbers into your FPU and doing the computation there.<p>Of course, you&#x27;ve given up all of your Python dynamicness. Now this won&#x27;t work with Bignums, it can&#x27;t be monkey patched, and now you have a compiling step to running your Python code. You can do this to your existing code one function at a time, so you don&#x27;t have to give those things up for your entire project, just where it matters. And where performance matters, it&#x27;s a godsend<p>I ported a small number of pieces of reddit to Cython. Here are some simple examples:<p>* <a href=""https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/db/_sorts.pyx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/db/_s...</a><p>* <a href=""https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/utils/_utils.pyx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/utils...</a><p>* <a href=""https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/mr_tools/_mr_tools.pyx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/mr_to...</a><p>* <a href=""https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/wrapped.pyx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/reddit/reddit/blob/master/r2/r2/lib/wrapp...</a><p>As the underscore naming implies, these are only selected performance or compute sensitive functions factored out of their normal non-underscore Python modules which generally wrap them. These functions were coming up disproportionately in profiling because they&#x27;re called very often and/or do a lot of arithmetic, and afterwards they are entirely nonissues. Often something like a _sorts.pyx:_confidence call got over 25 times faster.<p>I&#x27;ve also talked about the downsides in a thread here[1].
