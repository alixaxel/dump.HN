Now, this week, could they smoke only N-1 per day? Next week, could they smoke only N-2 per day?<p>Maybe it seems excruciatingly slow, but is it really? Plan it out.

I recently purchased a 2009 Chevy Tahoe Hybrid because I think I can tweak the electric drive to produce a lot more power - My own version of Tesla&#x27;s &quot;Ludicrous Mode&quot; for the Tahoe, electric backed up with the 6.0L V8. My target is 1000 hp, 500 from gas, 500 from electric (for a 1/4 mile at least). Just driving the truck unmodified, I am thinking that the marketing people for that vehicle did a bad job. It was panned in the press, but is very fun to drive.<p>Stock the truck can do 28 mph on electric only. Not bad for a 8 seat vehicle. Once I get done tweaking it, I should be able to drive full electric when I want ( I have a 5 mile commute!).<p>Personally, i am excited about all the good electric motors out there.

The human brain/body are incredibly good at translating intended action into precisely choreographed movements combining multiple muscles. The question is how much of each type of motion to use; the more the work can be offloaded to the whole arm, and the more relaxed the wrist and fingers are, the more comfortable it is to do something for a long period of time. The fingers still do quite a bit of fine motion, regardless.<p>But my comment doesn’t even advocate any particular grip or hand movement technique; all I said is that those bits of advice from the Palmer school, under discussion by the top-of-thread poster, are applicable across various letter-shape styles.

10142334,comment,10141364,10141892,0,0,pron,,,"I&#x27;ll just note that the JVM part in that comparison is wrong. The main difference between BEAM and the JVM is that BEAM implements a much larger part of the language&#x27;s functionality in the runtime, while -- at least for many JVM languages -- that is not the case with the JVM. The JVM -- similarly to the CPU+OS -- directly offers a rather general programming model -- shared memory, kernel threads etc., only with the addition of an optimizing JIT and a GC. BEAM, OTOH, operates at a much higher level, much closer to the Erlang language. It offers a very specific form of GC, a very specific form of shared memory, and a very specific scheduler. All of these -- just like BEAM implements them on the CPU+OS, can be implemented on top of the JVM, which implements a lower level-of-abstraction than BEAM.<p>The comparison, however, compares BEAM to a programming model (offered by the Java <i>language</i>) that is very close to the JVM&#x27;s native, low-level, abstraction. That is a lot like comparing Erlang and C, namely comparing two things that are aimed at completely different levels of abstraction. And just like Erlang can be (and is) implemented in C -- which is a lower level language -- so too it can be implemented in Java.<p>Its preemptive lightweight processes can be implemented in Java, its scheduler can be implemented in Java (both have been, in fact), and even its per-process GC can be implemented in Java (although that&#x27;s probably unnecessary given new Java GCs).<p>The reason BEAM is implemented that way is not because it results in a better Erlang runtime, but that a very specific, high-level VM, can yield good(ish -- BEAM is a <i>very</i> slow VM compared to HotSpot or V8) results at relatively little effort because the high-level constraints imposed by the language are used to restrict the scope of the runtime, while the JVM has required a much bigger investment to provide superb result across a wide variety of languages (HotSpot with its next-gen JIT is comparable to V8 at running JavaScript and PyPy at running Python, and not too far behind gcc at running C). The price that BEAM has to pay for that decision is that going beyond the very narrow limits of execution profile it supports well requires implementing the code in C. Which is why most large Erlang applications are mixed Erlang/C applications (Erlang for the control plane, C for the data plane), while JVM applications and library require virtually no native code (aside from the runtime itself, which is also moving more and more functionality to Java -- the next gen JIT is written entirely in Java).<p>The difference between the JVM (at least HotSpot; there are lots of JVMs) and BEAM is that BEAM is a reasonable, Erlang-specific (or languages with similar semantics to Erlang) VM, while HotSpot is a state-of-the-art, general purpose(ish) VM, with many, many man-centuries behind it.",1440912169

The recruiter scheduled it after I solved a programming puzzle.<p>After initial introduction and some details about the company, I said that I am looking for at least x salary (say 100k). 
The recruiter asks my current salary which I declined to say. Recruiter asks again and tells that I have to reveal the salary now or later before the offer is made. I declined, told him that it is my policy to not discuss existing salary. We ended the call quickly with the recruiter telling me to email if he ever reconsiders my position.<p>- How to handle these recruiters who always insist on current salary?
