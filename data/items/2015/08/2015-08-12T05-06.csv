Instead of having to find 0-days for Adobe Reader on Windows, Evince/Okular on Linux, and others, they only had to find a flaw in PDF.js itself.<p>The PDF.js project was started largely because Adobe Reader has a horrible security track record and Windows users don&#x27;t keep it up to date. Well, Linux users don&#x27;t generally use Reader, and they benefit from package management, so they were just needlessly put at risk to protect others.<p>I have changed FF to open all PDFs with Evince, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.

10046254,comment,10041653,10041653,0,0,Animats,,,"As someone who works on tasks reported on the Wikipedia conflict of interest noticeboard, I&#x27;ve been dealing with the paid editing problem for some time. Wikipedia is worth some effort to preserve; it is, after all, the highest rated non commercial site.<p>Most of the conflict of interest cases are simple promotion of a band/company/product/self by one person, usually someone with no other editing interests.  Some are detected automatically by programs which check new Wikipedia content against the web for duplicates. Those are checked for notability, and many are deleted because they don&#x27;t meet Wikipedia&#x27;s criteria for inclusion. A few years ago, this was mostly a problem with garage bands; now it&#x27;s a problem with garage startups. Those are easy to deal with.<p>Then there are subjects where there&#x27;s unquestioned notability, and the subject of the article is trying to look good.  Those usually involve content that reads like a sales brochure. Sometimes it&#x27;s well-cited, but to weak sources.  A typical example involves a company trying to list every flavor in which their product is available.  The usual response to this is to delete promotional language and unnecessary product detail.  The result can be a cold but well-cited article about the company&#x27;s financial history.  For individuals, resume inflation can be a problem.  The requirement for a reliable source usually deals with that. Wikipedia, remember, is about &quot;verifiability, not truth&quot;.<p>Promotional editing can backfire. Badly. When promotional editing is found, standard procedure is to look in Google for other information about the subject.  If this turns up clear negative info, it will probably go in the article and stay there. Criminal convictions, regulatory actions, accident reports, investigative reporting, and criticism by consumer groups reported in the mainstream press tends to displace PR-type material.  If the person or company has done something really bad, their article is likely to focus on that.  This can result in frantic efforts by a company to make the &quot;bad stuff&quot; go away.<p>I was involved with the &quot;Banc de Binary&quot; mess, where the company was desperately trying to remove their legal problems. (The SEC and CFTC had booted them out of the US for a long list of blatant securities-law violations.  Banc de Binary is not a bank, or a broker; they&#x27;re an online casino set up to look like a brokerage. They&#x27;re the &quot;house&quot;; if you win, they lose, and they set the odds.)  Banc de Binary at one point offered $10,000 on eLance for someone who could &quot;fix&quot; the article their way. That was noticed and got press coverage.  After much discussion on Wikipedia message boards, the article ended up rather negative on the company, all their accounts were blocked, and many people have that article on their watch list in case somebody tries something.<p>That&#x27;s unusual; it seldom gets that bad.<p>That&#x27;s the blatant stuff. More subtle spin is hard to detect.  Minor changes to obscure medical or technical articles to make some product look good are tough to deal with, because they require subject matter expertise.  This is a growing problem.  But the usual procedures work; if only vendor X is mentioned, a search for a competitor may turn up vendor Y, which can be added to the article.",1439358718

However, at 14 the very same work was already outstanding when compared to my friends at the same age, because most of what they were doing was running around on the yard.

10046235,comment,10039933,10044709,0,0,toufka,,,"1) for the most dangerous of diseases, we tend to know their mechanism (gene(s) responsible), precisely because if they&#x27;re dangerous then they are interesting genes and have been studied in the lab already. That&#x27;s not to say we know everything - but that information about genes is currently not limiting (for the field).<p>2) But what you can do in a close environment of the lab with clean rooms, infinite cells, lots of time, infinite do-overs, 30% success rates, and single-cell type environments you can&#x27;t do in a live body.  We&#x27;ve taken apart enough &#x27;cars&#x27; to know how the engine mostly works - which are the ignorable parts and which are critical.  We&#x27;ve even practiced remaking certain parts, even being creative about making <i>better</i> parts (synthetic bio) to upgrade the engine - however - doing all of the above on a running car that&#x27;s going 60mph is a whole different story.  Currently, the largest challenge is delivering your genetic payload to exactly, and <i>only</i> exactly where you want it.  Nowhere more, nowhere less, nowhere wrong, and just right.  That delivery is key (and part of why Cas9/crispr is a big deal, it solves part of the problem (<i>where</i> in a genome)).  But even if we can target where in a genome, we still need to target where in an organism, and where <i>not</i> in an organism. Delivery is the current limitation. You are made of 3 billion base pairs of information duplicated between a few trillion cells; A 0.00001% mis-delivery rate of this absolutely stunning, perfectly designed new gene/part/function is likely unacceptable.<p>3) Aging is a lot of things depending on who you ask.  Generally mammalian cells are designed to stop growing - otherwise you&#x27;d be a thousand-pound sphere of goop at this point rather than a well-defined human with shape.  This is a good thing.  But it means there are built-in limits on how many times a cell intended to divide.  Imagine a book with blank pages up front and in back, where the copy machine can&#x27;t copy the covers, so it always skips the first and last page.  Human cells have about 60 blank pages before they start eating into the text (genetic code) at which point they hit their last life and just try to never die (senesce). There are things we can do to add more pages with genetic therapy, but you got to be careful you don&#x27;t cause rampant growth (cancer).  SO aging is tricky, and a huge frontier that we know very very little about (hard to do experiments where your mean time to finish the assay is 60 years).  But there&#x27;s nothing inherently intractable about the concept that gene-therapies shouldn&#x27;t be able to affect.<p>Small molecules (&#x27;drugs&#x27; as you think of them), are great at killing invaders - things that are distinctly non-human (bacteria/viruses/fungi/etc.).  They are not good at affecting &#x27;disorders&#x27;, cancers or other issues where your own body is over/under/mis-reacting.  For that you need to change/alter/upgrade the body&#x27;s own toolkit.  This ability is what synthetic biology promises - access to that toolkit.",1439358353

It&#x27;s spelled out in painful detail in ACPI 6, and it requires a Skylake CPU to work safely.  The Skylake CPU is a big deal: it adds a PCOMMIT instruction that tells the CPU and memory controller to flush data out to memory-like storage to make it durable.  It also adds a CLWB instruction that&#x27;s important to get good performance.<p>Linux drivers for these devices are starting to appear.  The devices can appear as block devices or (much faster) byte-addressable memory-mapped devices.  Somewhat surprisingly, not all existing filesystems work on the latter -- filesystems expect atomic sector access, not atomic byte access.<p>This thing does not appear to be one of those devices.  According to the FAQ, they appear as block devices (so no super-fast mmap access).  There are no obvious performance numbers on their website.<p>Most worryingly to me, they don&#x27;t explain how it&#x27;s reliably durable on pre-Skylake systems.  To the best of my knowledge, getting this kind of thing to work reliably pre-Skylake involves nasty (and slow!) tricks with the memory controller, a hackish thing called ADR (asynchronous DRAM refresh), or maybe even a really awful hack in which power failure sends the OS an NMI and the OS responds by flushing the whole system cache (with WBINVD) and hoping that the PSU can keep the CPU and memory controller alive long enough for the flush to work.",1439358076

People will immediately reverse engineer the compression method.<p>???<p>How is privacy and secrets an issue here?<p>In both cases (1) is the best choice if you don&#x27;t want your competitors to get access to your algorithm.<p>In the patent case its <i>easier</i> for 3rd parties to find the implementation details <i>by doing no work themselves</i>. It&#x27;s also <i>significantly more risky</i>.<p>In the non-patent case, people have to actually <i>work</i> to reverse engineer the implementation, sure, but then they&#x27;re free to use it. There&#x27;s also no risk in selling and distributing the product.<p>So, lets see here, things which are better, since <i>both</i> paths lead to the algorithm being made freely available in the end:<p>1 - Do research, at risk that you&#x27;ll get sued into oblivion the moment you publish & sell. Even if you don&#x27;t immediately get sued, you have zero temporary competitive advantage because you <i>just told every competitor what you&#x27;re doing</i>.<p>2 - Do research and have temporary competitive advantage once you release it?<p>The only people who win in the patent way is lawyers.<p>The &#x27;secrets are bad&#x27; argument is a straw man; first you setup the straw man (but then we would never get to know the secret details!!?!!), then you punch it a few times (but sharing knowledge is good! How will the global body of knowledge grow if everything is just secrets??).<p>It&#x27;s just daft.<p>So yes, &quot;It seems like some refinements to when you can sue might be in order&quot;; indeed; ie. never.",1439355692

There&#x27;s already tons of research out there on what make a song happy, sad, etc. - all that would essentially be needed are base sounds as a reference point and the software would create various versions of an instrumental by cycling through example or custom melody patterns whcih alter the pitch of those base sounds. With all the info that&#x27;s out there, I&#x27;m really surprised this hasn&#x27;t been done before. Would definitely need a team for this, but I&#x27;d love to get my hands dirty in between managing.",1439355645

It&#x27;s a hindrance to innovation. <--- yes, that&#x27;s a period<p>In your case, I think you argue that there is nothing special about lava stones, and in fact, dirt/mud contains many stones. Probably, including tiny lava stones, whose only real difference with the additional lava stone bits is size.<p>So, adding stones is not very novel. There&#x27;s also not much difference between a lava stone and a non-lava stone; if I can put in a non-lava stone, I can probably just as easily put in a lava stone. Is it not obvious that if I can put a quartz into a mud pie, I could also put a lava stone?<p>I guess the general strategy is to find the more general pattern and then show that the patent is just a specific instance of a larger, known pattern.",1439355638

They don&#x27;t come with any preconceived notions of what programming should <i>look</i> like and given an explicit, visual model of the computer, they quickly learn the small number of operations to write programs. More over, once they learn to do<p><pre><code>   LDA A
   ADD TWO
   STA A

   DAT TWO 2 <-- initializing variable TWO 


 then, this line of code

    A = A + 2
</code></pre>
in C or a higher level language makes soooo much more sense. That awkward phase of internalizing that &#x27;=&#x27; is an assignment operator and is different from another operator meant to test equality gets a lot shorter for a beginner.<p>Btw, this is the best online CPU simulator I&#x27;ve found for that use <a href=""http://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peterhigginson.co.uk/LMC/</a>  I&#x27;m shocked at how all the code academies and hour of code&#x27;s haven&#x27;t created a polished version of LMC (Little Man Computer... look it up).",1439355627
