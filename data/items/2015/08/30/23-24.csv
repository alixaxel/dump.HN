As simple a thing as putting one new instruction in between two existing instructions can be a multi-stepped process, creating temporary intermediate structures that work better.  But admittedly I didn&#x27;t power through (or rather, power through with the kid) to the other side, so it might have ultimately been simpler than textual syntax, even if it&#x27;s not actually easy.<p>Hopscotch, an iOS app basically like Scratch (<a href=""https://www.gethopscotch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gethopscotch.com/</a>), seemed significantly better in this respect.

It&#x27;s very much a date.<p>For a programming framework, it would be the dev community around it. First I see if there is a community forming, that&#x27;s a really good indicator if the technology is good and if it&#x27;s here to stay. Then I start building a small app with the technology and interacting with people in the community online and offline. If the technology is meeting my needs and the community members are pleasant and helpful then I&#x27;ll commit.<p>Not being able to use NPM modules directly is kind of a bummer, but they can be ported to Meteor Packages.<p>Looking through Feathers, it does not seem very beginner friendly and there is a lot of configurations needed. I believe one of the reason Meteor gained a lot of traction because it was extremely beginner friendly. As I developed more Meteor apps I have also been able to utilize advance features as well. There was something for everyone.<p>With regard to the funding, I think that is a good thing. Big name investors won&#x27;t invest in something they don&#x27;t think will be at least 10x better than what currently exist. If something is that much better there will definitely be a way to make money without compromising the product. Google is a great example. They display ads based on your search history. If I&#x27;m looking to buy some shoes, I wouldn&#x27;t mind ads about shoe promotions. I believe the lead investor is A16Z and Marc Andressen cofounded Netscape, so I have confidence in them.<p>Competition is great none the less, so I hope Feathers pressures Meteor to constantly be better.<p>Here is an example project I&#x27;m working on if you need some insight to Meteor&#x27;s capabilities.

10144770,comment,10142373,10142373,0,0,jcr,,,"Many addictions are thoroughly enjoyable but ultimately harmful. Smoking\nis one such addiction. Some people shy away from the term &quot;addiction&quot;\ndue to all of the horrible connotations, but absolutely everyone is\n&quot;addicted&quot; to multiple things. The addiction might be a substance like\nnicotine, or the addiction might be a mannerism, or the addiction might\nbe over-eating, or the addiction might even be a way of thinking, but\nnone the less, human beings are always creatures of habit.<p>There&#x27;s an old and jaded phrase, &quot;You&#x27;re unique, just like everyone\nelse.&quot; The same can be said about addiction, &quot;You&#x27;re addicted, just like\neveryone else.&quot; When put in such simple and straightforward terms, the\ncommonality of harmful addictions like smoking shines through. You&#x27;re\nnot the first person or the only person with a harmful habit. The good\nnews is that we can change our habits. The bad news is that changing a\nhabit takes effort.<p>The problem is not smoking itself since if only done on rare occasions\nit can be exceedingly pleasurable, instead, the real problem is the\nhabit of smoking. It&#x27;s the _repeated_ and _extensive_ exposure to smoke\nentering your system that eventually kills you. The rates of emphysema\nand cancer (lung, mouth, throat, stomach, colorectal, ...) due to smoke\nexposure are extremely high in poor places where people cook their food\nover open flames or burn wood for heat without adequate ventilation. If\nyou are a habitual tobacco smoker, then you&#x27;re certainly not the only\none killing yourself with smoke, and unlike you, many must endure the\nsmoke to get the food and heat they need to just survive. You have it\neasy. You have a choice.<p>The harmful habits are  reinforced by the positive feedback of pleasure.\nAnother old and jaded phrase, &quot;Too much of a good thing,&quot; comes to mind,\nbut the misguided phrase, &quot;All things in moderation,&quot; is dangerous. The\ntrouble with the idea of all things in moderation is some things are\nsimply too addictive to even try, so they pose an irrational risk of\naddiction. Nicotine is <i>_immensely_</i> addictive on a chemical basis. In\nfact, the neurotransmitter receptor often used to measure the addictive\nqualities of substances is actually named after nicotine:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_receptor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotinic_acetylcholine_recept...</a><p>You may, or may not, understand all the biochemistry involved, but most\npeople can understand the logic of how a simple chemical compound like\nnicotine can cause a pleasurable response, and the pleasure can lead to\na habitual addiction.<p>If you are already addicted to a pleasurable but harmful habit, a mental\ntrick to solve the problem is to decide to never quit, but also decide\nto break the <i>_habit_</i> of pursuing your addiction regularly. You can\nharness your inner procrastinator to your advantage by simply saying,\n&quot;Maybe I&#x27;ll have a smoke later,&quot; when the urge hits you. Over time, the\nbeneficial procrastination gets easier and easier. The common &quot;Smoking\nCessation&quot; products, both prescribed and over-the-counter, like nicotine\npatches, gum, and mints may be helpful in your procrastination efforts,\nbut be wary of the all too common problem of replacing one addiction\nwith another.<p>Some have claimed that &quot;electronic cigarettes&quot; (e-cigs, vaporizers,\nvape) are useful for smoking cessation, but I have not personally seen\nany peer reviewed research results to support such claims. Similar to\nthe proven &quot;Smoking Cessation&quot; products (patch, gum, mints), the e-cigs\ncan provide nicotine in a form other than smoke, but since the nicotine\nitself is addictive, you still have the same substantial risk of merely\nreplacing one addiction with another. The common claims nicotine infused\ne-cigs being harmless are pure bullshit -- There is a reason why all the\nmajor tobacco companies now have their own brands of e-cigs; they want\nyou to become addicted.<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26270431"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26270431</a><p><a href=""http://www.ccjm.org/cgi/doi/10.3949/ccjm.82a.14054"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccjm.org/cgi/doi/10.3949/ccjm.82a.14054</a><p>><i>ABSTRACT</i><p>><i>Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes)—devices that generate a nicotine\nvapor that can be inhaled by the user in a fashion that mimics the\nexperience of smoking—are increasing in popularity, and many people\nseem to view them as reasonable alternatives to nicotine replacement\ntherapy to help them refrain from smoking.

You don&#x27;t need\nto be a genius or even particularly adept in chemistry to realize how\nnicotine is carcinogenic due to how it reacts in the body. Without being\ntoo fancy or confusing, when Nicotine loses its methyl group, it becomes\nNornicotine which when exposed to mild acids (syliva, digestive tract,\nlungs, or even acids in blood) becomes Nitronornicotine (NNN) which\n<i>_IS_</i> classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer\n(IARC) as a Group 1 Carcinogen.<p>Smokers die of colorectal cancer, but it&#x27;s not due to being assholes,\ninstead, it&#x27;s due to simple chemistry that everyone can understand.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Carcinogen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicotine#Carcinogen</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methyl_group</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nornicotine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nornicotine</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Nitrosonornicotine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Nitrosonornicotine</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_1_carcinogen"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_1_carcinogen</a><p>Yes, wikipedia disagrees with me about nicotine being a carcinogen, but\nwikipedia is dangerously wrong. The above linked pubmed paper is a good\nplace to start reading (references) about the role nicotine plays in\ncarcinogenesis, but there is a lot more research out there if you dig.\nThe tobacco (and e-cig) industry is continuously doing everything it can\nto prevent nicotine from being properly classified as a carcinogen by\nthe International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The editing wars\non the wikipedia nicotine page between the tobacco industry and health\n(research) professionals are staggering and notorious. You do not need\nto be a conspiracy theory kook to see all the blatant corruption and\nmanipulation at work under the guise of fake &quot;neutrality&quot; on wikipedia.<p>Additionally, since nicotine is an effective appetite suppressant, you\ncan expect to be hungry. Unless you can avoid replacing the satiation\npleasure of smoking with satiation pleasure of eating, you will gain\nweight, possibly a lot of weight. In this overly image conscious world,\nthe very idea of possibly getting fat(er) can be reprehensible enough\nfor some to chose smoking over weight gain -- This is a false dichotomy.\nUsing a fallacy of false choice to justify a continuation of a harmful\nhabit is simply irrational. Human biology has evolved to both crave\nsalts, fats, proteins, and sugars for survival, so the risk of replacing\na harmful smoking habit with a harmful eating habit is very significant.\nOnce you learn to harness your inner procrastinator to defer smoking\n(indefinitely), you may need to also harness it to eat less by deferring\neating until later. Also, when you do mistakenly gorge yourself on food,\nyou&#x27;ll notice something extremely odd, namely, you&#x27;re still hungry, so\nyou&#x27;ll eventually learn how eating fails to actually solve the (new)\nproblem of a perceived hunger sensation/craving. Small snacks of low fat\ncottage cheese (or tofu) and fruit may help, and some healthy salt cured\nfoods like olives and pickles may also help. The goal is to have a small\namount of reasonably healthy food that checks off all the required boxes\n(salts, fats, proteins, and sugars).<p>Your friend may be (rightfully) skeptical, but one of the know ways to\nstop smoking is refusing to quit, and surprisingly, the procrastination\nmethod works well for breaking or changing all sorts of harmful habits.\nI wish your friend the best of luck.",1440977547

It is also undefined for hypotheses which do not hold.<p>Sure, you can walk through the motions, put some numbers together, and eventually produce a number between 0 and 1. However that does not mean you have computed a p-value. If you are testing a non-null hypothesis you have not computed a p-value. If you are testing a null hypothesis that doesn&#x27;t hold, you have not computed a p-value.",1440976058

It also makes these concepts very visual, which serves as great reference once you start working with text based code.  I&#x27;m a huge, huge fan.",1440975896

I verified that these are under the GPL copyright by doing XYZ. The license requires that there be a way for me to get the source code from you. Despite many attempts at asking CSR how to get the source code, I have received no answer. This appears to be copyright infringement. If I do not get a response soon, I will be contacting the copyright holders, who have a successful history of prosecuting copyright infringement cases.&quot;<p>Unfortunately, that would only help improve public empathy. There is nothing you as a customer can do directly because you are not a copyright holder and have no standing to sue over copyright infringement. Abstractly speaking (since we know this isn&#x27;t the case here), it could be that CSR has a special waiver to let them use binutils and gcc without having to follow the GPL. You do not know that, nor can you compel them to reveal if they have such an agreement.<p>At this point, your next step should be to read and follow <a href=""http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-violation.html</a> .",1440975703
