To create an accurate scientifically meaningful study you would want to study 4 groups:<p>1. Children of affected parents raised by their parents.
2. Children of affected parents raised by someone else, an unaffected relative, for instance.
3. Children of unaffected parents raised by their parents.
4. Children of unaffected parents raised by affected parents.<p>If you see elevated reaction to stress in groups 1 and 2, but not 3 and 4, then there is a clear biological causation here. However, if you observe elevated reaction to stress in groups 1 and 4, but not 2 and 3, then there could be something environmental going on. Basically, in order to properly help people, we need to first properly identify the problem. For instance, if the problem is biological, then a biological solution in a form of a drug might be effective. However, if the problem is environmental, then psychological help for the prospective parents might be highly effective.<p>I understand that victims of the Holocaust are very old by now and it&#x27;s very hard to come up with proper sample groups. However, unfortunately, there are many other horrible instances of inhumane things going on in the world, and many instances of people surviving through those situations.

However, the catch is that if you just grab the form elements on submit you have to keep the html elements. There are a couple options here:<p>1. The simplest way is to put an onsubmit in your form element that handles this.<p>Example:<p><script><p>var postForm = function() {
	var content = $(&#x27;textarea[name=&quot;content&quot;]&#x27;).html($(&#x27;#summernote&#x27;).code());
}
</script><p><form action=&quot;#&quot; method=&quot;POST&quot; onsubmit=&quot;return postForm()&quot;>
....
</form><p>2. The other way is to use an onchange for the summernote element. Every time it changes it updates the textarea with the appropriate code.<p>Example:
$(document).ready(function() {
    $(&#x27;#summernote&#x27;).summernote({
      onKeyup: function(e) {
        $(&quot;#summernoteContent&quot;).val($(&quot;#summernote&quot;).code());
      },
      height: 300,
    });
});<p>where #summernoteContent is your textarea.<p>EDIT TO ADD:
Now with that said, my biggest issue is that the documentation is not clear on many things. Especially the API. Summernote has a pretty good API available, but it is poorly documented and is constantly evolving.",1440359332

Deploying your product
Lean Canvas
Validating your idea
Customer Development

Lean Analytics

I think that&#x27;s a mistaken approach.  &quot;Social&quot; tools certainly can have value in an organisation, but there&#x27;s nothing magic about a Facebook clone (or web-based IRC for that matter).<p>Our position at Fogbeam is that ESN&#x27;s (Enterprise Social Network), in order to provide real value, have to do more.  That is, they have to connect with the things and ways that people actually get work done, and make it easier to find (information|people|documents|whatever) that you need to do something... in addition to the fluffier &quot;idle chit chat&quot; aspects.  If an ESN can do that, then it can provide value.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m biased, as that&#x27;s one of the ways in which our ESN approach differs from some of the others.  We have a tremendous focus on integration with other enterprise applications. And we use semantic web technology to do automatic semantic entity extraction from the text flowing around the system, so we can build a knowledge-base that helps people find related information.<p>I&#x27;ll be the first to say that a lot of companies have not received as much value from deploying internal social software as they might have expected.  We just think it&#x27;s (in part) because they used first generation social software that doesn&#x27;t provided the needed capabilities.<p>Another reason that companies fail to get a lot of value from this stuff is much harder to resolve: company culture and values.  Simply put, some organisations will NEVER get much value from social software because the internal culture discourages collaboration, and encourages knowledge-hoarding, competition, backstabbing, secrecy and what-not.  If Joe Manager at one of those firms puts in Yammer, or Jive, or Lotus Connections, or Fogcutter, or anything else, it&#x27;s going to fail.  In those cases, it has little or nothing to do with the technology.<p>(Disclaimer: I&#x27;m totally biased, as my company makes &quot;enterprise social software&quot;.

... A module can contain one or more module members, which are commands (such as <i>cmdlets</i> and functions) and items (such as variables and aliases). The names of these members can be kept private to the module or they may be exported to the session into which the module is imported.
There are <i>three different module types</i>: manifest, script, and binary. A manifest module is a file that contains information about a module, and controls certain aspects of that module&#x27;s use. A script module is a PowerShell script file with a file extension of &quot;.psm1&quot; instead of &quot;.ps1&quot;. A binary module contains class types that define cmdlets and providers. Unlike script modules, binary modules are written in compiled languages. Binary modules are not covered by this specification.

Objects that capture light.<p>2) The examples of &#x27;ugly&#x27; artifacts are just that, incorrect implementations. There should be no halo or shadow around objects, which is caused by not implementing a smart-blur, which is required for SSAO.<p>3) Even in scenes containing walls, SSAO is often better because - other than baked lighting - the alternative was just straight Phong illumination, which gives essentially a straight line profile using the technique the author describes. Analyze corners for regular Phong and SSAO in the same way, and you&#x27;ll find Phong is the worse of them.
For example, regarding the images where the author says &quot;And sure enough, the darkening is way less prominent here than I think it is visually..&quot; What is not realized is that, with basic phong rendering, those gradual curves >would be flat lines< since the surface normals are constant. So yes, the effect is quite subtle, but we are still seeing a profile curve which has a &#x27;curve&#x27; to it, and we notice (feel/see) that.<p>4) SSAO is now replaced by HBAO, and even further by VXGI (Voxel cone tracing) and other GI methods that truly solve wall corners in the correct way.
