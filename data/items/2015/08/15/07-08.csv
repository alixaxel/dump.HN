Three videos, hours of footage, and the same facts repeated all over again. He very often mentions &quot; tricks of the trade&quot;, especially when tearing down high quality measurement equipment, and that&#x27;s something one cannot easily learn from without spending the bucks to buy some yourself. But for actual education about basics, the.information density is much higher in , and time spent more efficiently learning from a good book.<p>As a physicist I&#x27;m much more fascinated by Ben&#x27;s applied science videos, they explain phenomena covering a much broader field. Also I think Ben chooses his words much more wisely, and therefore in the end is a better educator. The density of information hence is also much higher.<p>He lacks a Crocodile Dundee&#x27;s Knife, though... :-)",1439625407

(I&#x27;m looking at you, Particle Physics!) Many of the articles are completely incomprehensible to anyone with less than grad-level knowledge of the topic, which sort of renders the whole exercise moot. An encyclopedia is meant to be accessible to the ordinary intelligent reader -- say about high-school level.<p>I appreciate that much of the subject matter -- especially when it comes to topics like Quantum Physics or Particle Physics -- is actually completely counterintuitive and weird, and that it is only, really, properly described by the math. Nevertheless, responding to comments requesting lay-level clarity along the lines of &quot;you won&#x27;t understand it unless you get a PhD in it&quot; is not at all helpful, and merely reveals an attitude of arrogant superiority.<p>Many of the physics pages could really use the help of an editor who <i>understands how to construct an $English sentence</i> and is comfortable using imagery and allegory to explain the concepts, even though those may likely be inaccurate, misleading or technically wrong.

10064661,comment,10064445,10064589,0,0,javert,,,"Yes. The research and technology certainly exists in academia, though I don&#x27;t think it has really been commercialized. Whether it&#x27;s actually going to be better in practice is going to depend on your workload and hardware, but RMA on SMP with migration (i.e. not separating the cores) definitely stands a chance of being significantly better than not allowing migration.<p>Here is a relevant paper that comes to mind:\n<a href=""http://www.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/papers/pdf/ecrts13a-rev1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpi-sws.org/~bbb/papers/pdf/ecrts13a-rev1.pdf</a><p>All that said, when you talk about RMA (rate-monotonic analysis), you are talking about simply assigning static priorities to each task. So if a task with priority 1 is available, it will always take precedence over a task with priority 2, for instance. (Equivalently and without loss of generality, a task with a higher rate will take precedence over a task with a lower rate.) There is a (potentially) vastly better way to do it, which is with dynamic (instead of static) priorities. Most of the intetesing academic research for multicore real-time is focused on dynamic priorities. Again, that stuff certainly can be much better in practice, and is quite well-studied in academia, but mostly hasn&#x27;t been commercialized, as far as I know. That&#x27;s because, for real-time systems, you really want to do the dumb obvious thing unless you have no choice. I think we are increasingly going to hit the &quot;you have no choice&quot; threshhold as we try to push the boundaries of what we can do while (often) simultaneously scaling down hardware. A &quot;really really smart drone&quot; would be a good example of something that would hit that threshhold. Maybe even a &quot;really smart car.&quot;",1439624491

But, if the solution to crime is simply to catch every criminal immediately after they commit their crime, the question is how will you do that?<p>The real interesting part of this was the sobriety program. They found a way to identify bad habits at a relatively low cost. How to extend that model to other crimes is unclear. Parole basically exists for that purpose already, so the question is how it can be made more effective.<p>I just don&#x27;t really see a clear path to general crime reduction here.",1439622755

Really, you should just lose access to public roads. But license revocation is adulthood revocation for all but the privileged few in SF, NYC, and maybe Chicago. In most of this country you can&#x27;t get groceries or primary medical care without driving, and you certainly can&#x27;t hold a job or provide a normal life for your children. A five-figure fine and even a month or two in jail is many times less severe than permanent loss of driving privileges; that&#x27;s life-destroying (pretty much your only option is to drop everything and move to a high-cost-of-living area of a high-cost-of-living city to get adequate public transit coverage).",1439622433

All in all I don&#x27;t think improving this bit of syntax would actually mean this much, it&#x27;s only worth considering when you start a new language from scratch.<p>But the records names / TDNR issue, this <i>makes a real difference</i>, I&#x27;ll definitely take a look at Frege if I&#x27;ll need functional programming on the JVM ...as Scala just seems too scary for me.<p>Now, about what I proposed above, I meant the two examples as different cases of the same syntax, newlines should not really make a difference until after the &quot;=&quot;. So you&#x27;d use the second variant for pattern matching:<p><pre><code>    myFunctionFoo :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int\n    : 1 b c =\n        1984 - c\n    : a b c =\n        2*a + 3*b + 4*c\n</code></pre>\nBut it&#x27;s probably better to direct your effort elsewhere. I see that even Typed Clojure prefers to repeat the name of a symbol instead of bothering to rearrange everything else just to avoid this repetition.<p>...and it&#x27;s probably not worth spoiling the beauty of the ML-style-syntax for this. I admit it, I find it 10x easier to read either Lisps or C-syntax-like languages than MLs, but there is a beauty in the ML way, and math folks seem to love it, so better keep it that way :)",1439622144
