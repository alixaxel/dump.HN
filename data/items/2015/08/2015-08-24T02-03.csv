This person would help with sales, marketing, proposals, etc. Mind you, &quot;freelancing&quot; is a business. it has to be treated as one. When you offload it to someone else you are going to get short changed. Programmers seem to have an issue with getting projects. Which is understandable given how most of us don&#x27;t care about sales or marketing.<p>Having patents and lots of experience makes closing a project a bit easier. But it doesn&#x27;t really help when talking to the decision makers. There is an episode[1] of .NET Rocks podcast where they discuss marketing for programmers. Its full of good stuff and you will definitely get great insights from it. Go listen to it and go from there.<p>[1]<a href=""https://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1181"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=1181</a>",1440385184

Pyrenees has a lot of white gravel next to the road, which might be what you&#x27;re thinking of (but there&#x27;s also green grass, dry pavement, and fall colors on the trees.)<p>I wonder if there&#x27;s a framerate issue or something that makes times not really comparable system to system.  I can run that course in about 2:15 in much faster cars than the Carerra RS (2000 911 Turbo, GT1, 935, all carefully tweaked/upgraded) -- with an analog racing wheel and tons of practice.  I&#x27;ve seen youtube videos of people coming in at around 2:05 in those cars by running insanely tight lines.  I can&#x27;t imagine how you could be even faster than that in an RS, with a top speed that&#x27;s slower than what I take most corners at in my GT1.<p>And yeah, it&#x27;s a hugely high quality game, particularly for the era.  It was clearly a labor of love.  I&#x27;ve got a handful of games from the 1990-2000 era that I still play because nothing else captures the magic quite the same -- DooMII, Descent, and NFS:PU.<p>(Source port links: DooMII - Zandronum at <a href=""http://zandronum.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zandronum.com/</a> ; Descent - Retro at <a href=""http://descentchampions.org/new_player.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://descentchampions.org/new_player.php</a> )",1440385136

You&#x27;re basically left with a p inside a td, when before there wasn&#x27;t one.  I feel like if you press a key and then press delete, you should go back to the exact state you were in before (or maybe after pressing delete twice).<p>Another thing that bugs me is when elements that should be rejoined after a split are not rejoined.  For instance, if you inadvertently split a ul in two by hitting return one too many times, and then you press delete, with many editors you will now have two ul elements (and potentially weird spacing in the middle of the list in the final rendering).  Another example: removing and then re-adding italics to a paragraph that had been 100% italics before the edit.  Before, you had one i element, but now you might have three.  I&#x27;ve seen some editors handle these cases some of the time, but I haven&#x27;t found one that handles them 100% of the time.<p>In terms of features, I have always looked for the ability to visually edit Bootstrap or Foundation columns.

Part of the quality-based initiatives are to nudge providers (via reimbursements/penalties) to treat things while it&#x27;s early enough, both for the health of patients and cost reduction—instead of waiting for complications.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=DELSA/HEA/WD/HWP(2011)1&docLanguage=En"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentp...</a>",1440382786

The frontend will look the same. You can brows issues, downloads, wikis the same. You can even sync code using a DVCS client like svn, git, or hg.<p>i.e. all the data that was there right now will stay there until January.<p>Projects will still be able to be exported to GitHub via code.google.com/export-to-github. In addition, project administrators can still use Google Takeout to get a JSON dump of their projects issues.<p>There are a few projects that will stay read-write for a few months, for example /p/chromium and /p/android. These projects will keep doing their issue tracking on Google Code until a replace issue tracker is ready.<p>If a project needs some administrative action, such as deleting a project or setting up a &quot;project moved&quot; URL you can contact google-code-shutdown@google.com and somebody (most likely me) will twiddle the bits on your project.<p>Important note: All links to code.google.com will continue to work as normal.<p># Coming soon: The Google Code Archive!<p>Obviously deleting ~a decades worth of open-source project data and breaking millions of links would be a very bad thing. Nobody on the Google Code team wants that to happen, so we are working to ensure that doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Tomorrow we will hopefully launch &quot;The Google Code Archive&quot; which is a slimmed down frontend for Google Code that renders an archive of project data, served from App Engine and Google Cloud Storage.<p>This Archive site will continue to host public (and only public) Google Code project data years into the future.<p>While it is in beta, the Google Code Archive will use a different URL scheme than current Google Code projects. Later this year, we will have the Google Code Archive frontend replace URLs to the old project hosting frontend. So urls to old Google Code projects will continue to work, but be hosted from a new website. (But you should be able to switch to the old one if need be via URL parameter.)<p># What will happen after January 2016<p>After January 2016, we will turn down the old frontend and only serve data from the Google Code Archive.<p>The data that won&#x27;t be preserved is private data. Things like issues labeled with Restrict-View-* (which only project admins, committers, etc. can view). Or projects that are marked as &quot;Members Only&quot;. I haven&#x27;t analyzed the exact numbers here, but this doesn&#x27;t make an appreciable amount of the data on Google Code.<p>The big difference in January however is that we won&#x27;t have the DVCS frontends running any more. So you will not be able to sync project source code using svn, git, or hg. Another outcome of this is that we won&#x27;t be serving raw repo contents.<p>Hopefully that clears things up.

Whatever the reason for the crackdown now, it doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t manually try to track these embarrassing tweets and then publish them under fair use protections...in fact, the Anthony Weiner scandal, in which a user noticed an accidentally posted DM, was what sparked Politwoops in the first place. It&#x27;s just you can&#x27;t do it on a wide-scale, automated basis via API.<p>I&#x27;m kind of surprised Politwoops informal waiver lasted this long...or rather, that no one else has applied its open source code to the tracking of celebrities...if that had ever happened (say, as an informal service of TMZ or Gawker), I have no doubt Twitter would shut that down, as celebrities would be spooked by having their mistakes be essentially non-deletable...and their protests would carry a lot more notice than politicians&#x27;.<p>edit: Another relevant link: the unitedstates/congress-legislators repo, which is a crowdsourced listing (augmented by a automated framework) of Congress social media accounts: <a href=""https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators</a>",1440382141

However a lot of the high resolution satellites are in polar or nearly polar orbits so one satellite will see the whole Earth in a couple orbits. There&#x27;s just not a need to collect and process all that information unless there&#x27;s some reason to be looking at that chunk of land or sea. Generally they&#x27;d be focused on more pressing issues like monitoring other countries military bases instead of trying to find a mostly harmless ship in the North Atlantic.<p>If there was some reason that this ship was an actual threat to countries like the US or Russia who have the large high resolution satellite networks in place it probably would have been found pretty quickly. There just wasn&#x27;t a reason for the effort to be expended to look for it, the ship was old and being scrapped and wasn&#x27;t full of anything particularly dangerous to worry any of the countries that could find it.",1440382022
