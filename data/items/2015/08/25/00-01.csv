10113787,comment,10113413,10113413,0,0,rm999,,,"I switched from mostly using R to Python about a year ago for gluing together my data pipeline (from data source all the way to production models and frontends/visualizations). It hasn&#x27;t really impacted what I&#x27;m capable of doing or my productivity, except the standard extra googling that comes in the first couple years I use any language.<p>The main reason I went for Python is purely practical: it&#x27;s a language people outside my team will respect and deal with. It makes it easier for me to collaborate in many different ways: share tools with other teams, transfer ownership of my code, get help when I need it, etc. Data science at some companies has the reputation of &quot;hack something together and throw it over the wall for someone else to deal with&quot;. In my experience R only furthers this reputation. Which is too bad, it&#x27;s really great at what it does.",1440464326

10113781,comment,10113639,10113639,0,0,some-guy,,,"About five years ago I worked at Wells Fargo as a teller while in college.  During that time Congress passed a law prohibiting debit transactions from going through if there weren&#x27;t enough funds in the account.  Shortly after that we were told to start telling our customers about a new service called Debit Card Overdraft Service which was marketed as a &quot;convenience&quot; for customers when they were in a bind.<p>When I asked my branch manager about this service in person, he said he was told by his manager that the company was going to lose billions of dollars due to the new law and that this service was meant to alleviate those losses.  I filed an ethical complaint since I believed that it violated one of their Team Member Codes of Ethics regarding &quot;encouraging reckless financial behavior&quot;.  It pissed off my manager, which pissed off his boss, and then I had a round table meeting with them.  My manager then claimed that he never said anything about losing money, and that the new service was unrelated to the new laws passed in Congress.  Since I couldn&#x27;t prove he said those things I decided to drop it, but he told me I no longer had to advertise the service.<p>It still irks me that there was absolutely nothing I could do about the situation.  After I quit some of my co workers told me that they were told that the service was used to make up for lost revenue also, but they were afraid of speaking up since they didn&#x27;t want to lose their jobs.  I had less to lose because I was a college student studying CS.",1440464254

I do a significant amount of development involving PostgreSQL and I don&#x27;t think I would want to rely on this.  I don&#x27;t want to belittle the work in question, but as someone that can develop for the database, I have other, better techniques which can provide defensive in depth such as injection prevention while not relying on yet another third party extension.  I can set up stored procedure barriers, view barriers, and more between the data in my database and outside access from application tiers.  Some of these techniques provide injection prevention as a side effect and in those cases where I do have to consciously provide such protection, I can do so in a central point of access that can service distributed application tiers.<p>Having said that, there are many development shops that don&#x27;t have strong database development talent on hand and really treat the database as some black box where to stuff data.  In these instances, the database development centric approaches aren&#x27;t feasible as practical matter.  In these cases, I think such a tool can be helpful since at least it gives you the choke point.  Where you&#x27;d run into issues in this scenario is that this tool requires a learning period to know which queries are good and which aren&#x27;t.  When an application developer changes code, I would imagine that you&#x27;d have to address the SQL firewall training as well; a developer that might not be as comfortable developing for the database might not consider that factor and you might get some wonky deployments.

A split stream might seem complicated, but IMHO it&#x27;s an amazingly clean way of simplifying the problem.<p>---<p>The problem is not figuring out what sizes things are, but the routing. When you have 30+ instructions a cycle, you need to route a lot to a lot of different places. You also can&#x27;t do a parallel read since the size of previous instructions affects the placement of the next instruction - you will eventually fix this with routing but it&#x27;s not easy.<p>Consider a 30-wide instruction. Decoding it involves knowing where in the instruction stream it starts. This can only be known once the prior instruction is partially parsed.<p>Consider its later half - this can only be read after the first half is read. In your case, you actually only need to read the 2-bit prefixes but the difficulty remains.<p>With a split instruction stream, since there are two independent (at least until a branch) program counters so you have twice the contextual information. You already know where the second half starts from the prior instruction.<p>One more great thing about this is that the contextual information is preserved in jumps, without increasing the size of jump instructions. Even if prior instructions had metadata about splitting the next instruction for parsing (at yet more space wastage), this would be lost across jumps. That would worsen jump latency, which is a common bottleneck.<p>The above point is <i>way</i> more important if you expect a flow instruction almost every bundle, due to the massive ILP the Mill has.<p>---<p>> With instruction sizes of 1-4 bytes, you could store instruction sizes in 2 bits per instruction.<p>However, the Mill does not constrain its instruction sizes to multiples of 8 bits. This means either you&#x27;d lose that bonus or you&#x27;d need even more bits.<p>The Mill also splits which instructions are allowed in each half. Not only does this give you a free implicit bit, it again halves the amount of work for each decoder. This could probably happen with interleaved halves like you describe, but not without difficulty.<p>> For example, you could use 0x01 both for INC and ADD IMMEDIATE VALUE, where it means the former if the instruction length is 1, the latter if it is longer, with the size of the immediate determined by the size of the instruction. Would that be a net win?<p>The answer is no. The instructions codes are generated to be space optimal. I&#x27;m not sure how this is done, but it has been stated. They also leave it open for metadata like you mention to be included in each instruction stream, and in fact their blocks do have headers.<p>> creating those two streams that somehow must work together to do what a single statement sequence in the source code does<p>Given the instructions are disjoint and they only need synchronization at jumps, I would be very surprised if this was problematic.",1440462568

The expertise needed to bring a drug to market doesn&#x27;t currently exist within NIH funded entities.  They are trying to create it, but have been having a hell of a time.  Discovering new science and bringing a drug to market are two very different things.<p>2. The prize system has it&#x27;s own challenges.  First off, the prizes would have to be huge.  Lipitor sales were over $100B during the 10+ years it was on the market.  A $2B prize won&#x27;t mean much.<p>3. The biggest challenge with the prize system is how do you judge whether or not someone deserves the prize?  For example, if we offer a prize for a new antibiotic for multi-drug resistant bacteria, how do you judge whether or not the new drug met the goals?  Evaluating a new drug is not black and white at all.  What if it kills the bacteria, but is really toxic?  What if it works, but not for everyone?  Do they still get the prize?",1440462112

(Reusable bags usually aren&#x27;t  eligible for recycling, but when they end up at centers by mistake, they often wrap around and jam moving equipment.) Single-use bags can also pose health hazards to wildlife and livestock -- during a recent trip to Dubai, I heard a plastic recycler lament that ranched camels frequently die from ingesting the plastic bags that are constantly catching flight in the desert wind -- and even when they do wind up at landfills, they take centuries to decompose.<p>If the desirable outcome is to reduce overall usage of plastic bags then banning them is absolutely the right decision.<p>The evidence shows that people don&#x27;t value reusable bags highly enough. Which is understandable because stores only charge 10 cents for them (at least in the Bay Area). The solution isn&#x27;t to repeal the ban: it&#x27;s to raise the mandated price of reusable bags to something like $5. Tax undesirable behavior and it will go down.",1440461986

It makes an Indian curry in a large quantity and is managed by one operator who can probably handle 3-4 of these without breaking a sweat.<p>It has a large pot, a stirring method, and a few canisters above loaded with relevant ingredients. These arrive preprepared. Sliced onions, peeled and quartered potatoes, spice mixes, water, stock, yoghurt, pureed tomato, whatever. Each canister assesses weight. An app predicts demand (based on day of week) and instructs the operator as to the quantities required. He tips in the prepared onions, potatoes, etc - the required weight of each. The robot doesn&#x27;t have to peel or chop anything. The ingredients arrive in bulk.<p>The machine is given the recipe (basically temperature graph and time to introduce each canister. Oil, stir, stir, onion, stir for x minutes, potatoes, protein and so on. Imagine a Thermomix that you can preload with ingredients.<p>The operator has loaded up one machine, then does another, and another. While waiting, he starts to prepare packaging. As machines finish and switch to warming mode, he serves portions to packages and loads the delivery method which has backed up to an open window/door nearby. The vehicle is like a post office mailbox wall with a warming method - it drives up to a house indicating the order is in a particular box. The recipient grabs their order and a server is notified.<p>The operator back in the &quot;restaurant&quot; wipes down the machines as required. The app calculating servings auto-places orders for replacement ingredients based on what was used.<p>If you have a sole driver, most of that could be built and solved now. We could make a set of warming drawers that sideload into a stock van. We could build an apparatus that sits above a giant Thermomix or KitchenAid-type appliance.<p>I think the keys to it all are not trying to solve the most difficult bits of each equation. IMO, those are: robots that can prepare ingredients, delivery from street to the front door, and a menu that includes things that are difficult to produce and serve en masse. This approach could still handle countless stir-fries, curries, soups, and a few salads (a Thermomix makes a half-decent coleslaw in 3 seconds - we do it all the time).",1440460992

There&#x27;s clearly frustration with the extent to which people are tracked (often without their knowledge), and I don&#x27;t disagree with that at all.  Then there&#x27;s the point of &quot;well, is that extra data actually paying off to be worth the negative brand perception and invasiveness?&quot;  And the answer there totally depends on whom you ask and how you ask that question.<p>Taking an even further step back I can say that the entire point of advertising is and has always been to get a message in front of a target audience, whether it is driving sales, retaining customers, fending off competitors, promoting a non-profit cause, etc.<p>There are many channels to do that these days, and advertisers constantly struggle with the question of &quot;is this meeting our objectives?&quot;  The joke about not knowing which 50% of your ad spend is being wasted is very much alive and well today in a world the availability of data has vastly outpaced the mainstream advertiser&#x27;s ability to harness it.  So I&#x27;d say overall, the answer to the question around whether the extra tracking is worth it is largely a question mark when you get into the nitty gritty of it.<p>If someone asked me what the hardest part of my job was, I would say it is determining what the contribution was of a given channel/campaign/placement/keyword/ad/etc. to my end goals, ie. attribution.  The display industry is massive and make no mistake, we&#x27;ve come a long way in terms of understanding effectiveness.  Ultimately though, most advertisers who do any sort of branding campaigns will tell you that they don&#x27;t know definitively what value that contributed if you hold their feet to the fire on questions around attribution.  Did the personalized ecommerce retargeting ad really remind them to buy or would they have done so anyway? What&#x27;s the value of a view-through conversion? If a video pre-roll unit autoplays without sound, what is its value compared to a user-initiated play? Etc.<p>I say all of this not as an excuse (our industry has many issues, make no mistake), but to highlight the fact that as an advertiser, I honestly wish at times that it was as simple as the old glory days of Madison Avenue where the creatives ruled the roost.  Heck, I&#x27;d even be ok with the days before people realized the shortcomings of last-touch attribution what with ignorance being bliss and all that.<p>As an advertiser, I don&#x27;t want to spend my dollars where they are not effective.  I also don&#x27;t want to piss people off with it.  I recognize that is a hard line to walk and you can never please everyone.  That said, I don&#x27;t see things going away or drastically changing on the data collection side.  There are enough companies who have conclusively determined that this is a more effective approach for them than not using the data.  It will take either some revelation that their data is a lie and it is NOT in fact working, or it will take policy and legal action to get them to stop.<p>The broader question should be around finding other business models that work, and trying to find new approaches that remove ads from the picture.  People will vote with their wallets figuratively and literally, even if they disagree with you.<p>For those that hate people like me and my industry on principle, the current approach of finding technological solutions to limit data is a great start, and I can&#x27;t blame people for using them one bit.  I can&#x27;t say we&#x27;ll ever see eye to eye, but I can say that I respect your opinion because the industry as a whole has not done a great job of earning your trust.  I wonder if people felt the same way back in the days of Madison Avenue when ads first started encroaching on more and more media channels (despite the fact that many media channels only grew to their current popularity BECAUSE of advertising).",1440460912
