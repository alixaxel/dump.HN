Required Warning Before Exposure To Chemicals Known to Cause Cancer Or Reproductive Toxicity.<i></i> No person in the course of doing business shall knowingly and intentionally expose any individual to a chemical known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity without first giving clear and reasonable warning to such individual, except as provided in Section 25249.10<p>Again, from your source, California Code of Regulations,<p>Title 27, Article 6.

Further, the clear and reasonable warning you give should include specifically how that product will expose you to harmful chemicals (e.g. eating/drinking this Soylent will expose you to potentially harmful amounts of lead  [don&#x27;t know, we didn&#x27;t test it, lol!]; or, eating/drinking this Soylent will expose you to X.Y (m/c/k)g of lead, which is known to the State of California to cause cancer or reproductive harm).",1439758634

It&#x27;s not documented but it greatly helps catch zone allocation problems (OSMalloc/OSFree/buffer overrun) issues.<p>2. Use snapshots instead of rebooting. It&#x27;s much faster to revert back to a snapshot than to reboot your virtual machine instance after a crash.<p>3. If you use a shared directory between your instance and host machine for moving your KEXTs/other code, make sure to MD5 the files before loading. It&#x27;s very common for the instance to be using stale cached blocks.<p>4. While not necessary, I create a separate network interface that&#x27;s host only to debug on. I give it a static ip and add an entry to my host&#x27;s host file. It makes debugging instances easier to do since I can connect by name, i.e. kdb-remote vm0.",1439758517

Plenty of folks who live in low density residential areas don’t necessarily want to drive everywhere or live a suburban lifestyle, but are stuck there by housing prices in more urban areas. There could even still be a large number of single-family houses once you get 3–4 blocks away from transit stops, and they would be cheaper than they are now, because there would be less demand on them.<p>The whole city (and the whole Bay Area) has absurdly priced housing, and even in the southern/western areas of the city ($1500+/month per bedroom), rents suck up  a huge proportion of people’s income and middle-class folks are priced out. Young people who aren’t in the tech industry can only afford to live in the city if they cram several roommates into a tiny single-family house or flat and spend 50% of their income on rent, and many service workers in SF are commuting in from far outside the city. The middle-income people I know in SF are mostly still there through rent control, wouldn’t be able to afford it if they were just moving in, and are stuck in their current house/apartment unless they want to completely leave the city.<p>As someone who grew up in a suburb, my personal opinion is that suburbs may be friendly for “families” but they suck for people aged 9–25, 65+, anyone single, or anyone who can’t get around by car or doesn’t enjoy driving everywhere. Luckily the low density parts of San Francisco are still pretty navigable by bicycle, and have reasonable access to downtown, so they’re not as bad as many other suburbs.",1439757184

She grew up in serious poverty because she grew up in Germany during WWII and its aftermath. My father grew up in the Great Depression and fought in two wars. Having known serious privation, they both placed a high value on making sure people got fed well.<p>When I was growing up, my father was often unemployed for months at a time. But they had put a very large down payment on the house we lived in, such that their house payment was about 40% of what the neighbors were paying for nearly identical houses. We had a garden and a good percentage of the meat we ate was game, often hunted by my father.<p>So we tended to have not much money and generally had less income than the neighbors, but we ate a helluva lot better than other folks around us. I lived almost like people did 100 or more years ago, before work was about earning money per se, when it was much more about literally putting food on the table.<p>I have a genetic disorder. It was diagnosed late in life, at age 35. I think it took me that long to get sick enough to get diagnosed in part because I was fed so well and I continued that tradition after I moved out.<p>I am currently homeless, somewhat by choice and somewhat not. This has been on my mind a lot here lately: I wonder how much it is a real choice and how much it is a lack of viable options. The short version is that the options available to me failed to support my goal of getting well.<p>And I am getting well. A very big part of how that is happening is based on eating right. Part of the upshot of getting well is that my brain works better.<p>For six months, I was homeless in La Jolla, one of the two most expensive zip codes in the US. I was surrounded by college students from very wealthy families who did things like flew home to another continent for Christmas and told humorous stories about casually lost expensive electronics. These kids were often envious of what I was eating. They made remarks that made it pretty clear they really did not know how to properly feed themselves.<p>I don&#x27;t know the answer. But I don&#x27;t think this is about money per se. We seem to think wealth is about having lots of stuff. As a society, I feel like we have lost our way in some important way.<p>I wonder a lot how to solve that problem.",1439756246

Not very familiar with the app sandbox model, but what exactly would be truly innovative about it?<p>It is not part of any POSIX compliant UNIX.<p>It also pushes developers into a micro-kernel style of application development, which isn&#x27;t common in UNIX.<p>>  Also, it&#x27;s a hybrid of Mach, which is heavily anachronistic and clunky. DragonFly BSD, on the other hand, actually does through the vkernel mechanism.<p>Besides FreeBSD, I admit I hardly know any other BSD.<p>> I have no idea what you mean by the third one. Are you saying that the root user&#x27;s privileges are segmented into multiple subsystems?<p>In El Capitan, you can only be real root in safe mode. In normal mode there are paths (e.g. /bin, /usr/bin,...) and APIs that aren&#x27;t available even to processes running as root.<p>> You can write applications targeting any subsystem provided there are bindings, which there are. For instance, Python and Vala are heavily used in contemporary Unix-like DEs for application programming.<p>There is a big difference in being a first class language used in the vendor SDK and IDE, and a third party one used by some developers.",1439756065
