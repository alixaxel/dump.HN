I&#x27;ve never used SQLite for mocking but I&#x27;ve used HSQLDB for functional tests of an extensive ORM-derived DAOs that talked to Oracle in production in the past. It was pretty flawless. I.e. when running in Oracle emulation mode HSQLDB was pretty close to the real thing for our purposes. For a few tiny differences we had automatic script that would convert from Oracle schema creation file to HSQLDB &quot;Oracle&quot; schema creation file any time changes to the real schema were introduced.",1438696782

The reality is that battery tech is expensive, heavy, and delicate so hybrids still make sense. A near empty gas tank weighs nothing and a near empty battery weighs the same as a full one. This stuff gets a bit more complex as you look into how it really works. Not to mention the Volt comes in at pricing that&#x27;s half or even 1/3rd the price Tesla, depending on packages/trim.<p>The Volt is a great concept and the next logical step in hybrid technology.

From Project Xanadu to the BeOS to the WinFS it has been a recurring idea in computing and for a good reason, I think. However, as far I am aware no popular implementation of it for Linux, the BSDs, Windows or OS X exists.<p>In particular, I have long wanted to implement a tag-based file system. Tagging should be easier to implement than a full-on DB-as-FS and, importantly, it would be easier to interop with existing file systems and tools that talk to them.<p>My design ideas for it so far are as follows:<p>You can map each tag to a directory at the tagging file system&#x27;s mount point. Each of these N directories would then contain N-1 for each of the remaining tags to allow you to select files that have two or more tags. For example, the files with the tags &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; would be accessible through /tagfs/a, /tagfs/b, /tagfs/a/b and /tagfs/b/a.<p>In contrast to a DBFS accessed through, say, &quot;/dbfs/SELECT * FROM .../&quot; it would be possible to use &quot;ls&quot; to get the list of all the tags, to apply the POSIX permission model in a way that made sense and suchlike. E.g., the permissions of /tagfs/a/b/c could be an intersection  of those for &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot;.<p>One problem with this approach is in how ordinary (non-tag) directories would be  interact  with the directories that represent your tags. Not distinguishing them for the user would create a potential for confusing misfiling errors and  data loss on deletion. Distinguishing them by giving the tag directories special names (e.g., ones that begin with a sigil) or permissions would limit the system&#x27;s power. Extended attributes are not easy to see visualize in most GUIs, etc.",1438696312

Within alcohol, for every dollar the Australians spent on alcohol, on average, he/she allocated 65 cents on beer, 20 cents on wine and the remaining 15 cents on spirits.<p>* &quot;Consumer Insights&quot; [2]:<p>> In developed wine markets, people drink wine because they want to enjoy it, not because of the health benefits they might get from it.<p>(ha!)<p>> People attach different values to wines in relation to the occasion they are faced with. However, consumers with stronger personalities are less subject to normative influences.<p>(ha ha!)<p>> There are different segments of consumers in the on-line environment, with different level of skills and trust towards this form of retailing. Convenience and the price comparisons are attractive, but people still don’t like the fact that wines cannot be tasted and they are worried about the security of the transactions. This may change, but recent research still finds risk an issue. Online purchasing represents about 5% of the total wine market in developed countries.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.adelaide.edu.au/wine-econ/events/2030workshop/pubs/Selvanathan_WC0210.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.adelaide.edu.au/wine-econ/events/2030workshop/pu...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://research.wineaustralia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Consumer-Insights-discussion-paper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.wineaustralia.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04...</a>",1438696247

Good to see you around HN again.<p>Check this out: <a href=""https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/49440-Distribution-of-Income-and-Taxes.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments...</a><p>Specifically p.18 Figure 8.<p>Figure 8 shows that since 1980, real income has grown 174% for the top 1 percentile of earners, 56% for the 81st-99th percentile, and 16% for anyone earning below the 81st percentile. Also note that these are 2011 numbers, and that inequality has gotten worse in the past 4 years.<p>This is probably the most succinct and alarming graph that shows the degree to which inequality is growing and wealth is being transferred to the top 10% of earners in the US.<p>Historically, a strong middle class has driven housing which in turn powers consumption, the engine that powers America&#x27;s economy. [1] Housing construction was heavily subsidized on both the supply (construction) and demand (purchasing) front by the government after WWII - in 1940 only 44% of Americans owned a home whereas in 1960 62% could make this claim. Along with this spike in ownership came increased consumption of all goods that owning a new home implies - a car, a dishwasher, utilities, spending on children, etc.<p>Owning a home also reflects well on an family&#x27;s balance sheet: After paying off the mortgage in 10, 20, 30 years, the property is usually a middle class family&#x27;s most valuable asset by far.<p>With the decline of the middle class, less and less working class people will be able to afford to own a home. Instead, they will be forced to rent. [2]<p>The rich will invest in real estate as they have since the beginning of time, and will seek rent as a generally reliable form of earning a return on their capital. With employment numbers improving, but income staying relatively the same, we can foresee a picture of more people working just to pay the rent, and not having enough left over to afford a mortgage, kids, etc.<p>So to answer your question: the people with money will own the property, and the people without money will work to afford rent. Unless the government take serious steps towards reversing the rapid accretion of wealth to the upper quintile of earners, the future of housing for my generation looks very bleak in my opinion.<p>[1] <a href=""http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/jcr/31/1/236.full.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/jcr/31/1/236.full.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf</a>",1438695428

If they don&#x27;t like books, B+N now sells legacy music CDs, dvds, board games, legos, kids toys, chocolate bars, coffee, magazines, pretty much anything in the store can be wrapped up as a gift for someone else in a couple hours.

For example, someone who usually buys engineering textbooks and SF may never see a travelogue.<p>That&#x27;s a dumb criticism, since the merchandising of a brick-and-mortar bookstore typically does the same thing as that of an online retailer: presents whatever the store is trying to get rid of to everyone up-front, and otherwise presents people with things related to what they are searching for specifically, avoiding exposing them to the rest.<p>You can actively choose to browse (wander through a physical bookstore, click different categories for an online one) for the purpose of providing yourself opportunities for serendipity, but no bookstore is designed to encourage serendipity, because anything that does that is a terrible UX for most customers and leads to confusion, frustration, and not buying, and the store going out of business.",1438694042

In this case that meant loading some flash object. Embedding malicious flash is one of the easiest ways to get a person to run your code, but you need a popular site to do anything large scale. Yahoo is responsible in that they own a vector (their ad network paired with their popular web properties) that makes this large scale distribution trivially simple for the attacker.<p>Content providers (web property owners) <i>should</i> be responsible for the ads that get served on their site but, given how the ecosystem has evolved, they have very little control. The most a content creator can do is switch to a different ad network. This case is interesting because the ad network and the content property were owned by the same entity; switching networks makes no sense.<p>The quality/safety of ads is left up to the network and the ad creators. Obviously the creators cannot be trusted. The network has little incentive to police thoroughly (although it seems like Yahoo did take some action in this case). There is such a glut of ad real estate that individual content creators have effectively zero power to affect change. If one of the networks strove to promise a better experience for the content providers (and us; the ultimate consumer) it could cause content providers to switch networks. But that costs money and no ad network has the incentive to be first. They simply don&#x27;t need to in order to continue being competitive.<p>It will be interesting to see what happens in the next few years. It seems like companies (Apple in particular) are starting to try to gobble up as much content as possible. If enough providers sign on to such programs, these &quot;co-ops&quot; could have significant bargaining power with regards to the ad networks. But who knows what other issues will crop up. Today everybody has a website or a blog that they need to independently monetize via ads. Grouping together under the banner of a large company could work well for them, or they could effectively become web serfs. It&#x27;ll be interesting to see either way.",1438693855
