We would get as many things working as possible by the &quot;hard deadline&quot;, and our customers for these new products (who would be developers themselves and would know that these were new products for us) would understand that a gradual replacement of our old technologies was just good engineering, not a sign that our new products weren&#x27;t good.<p>But she told me with a smile that we were going to replace all of our Web apps simultaneously with a matched set of replacements showcasing what could be done with our new products (one of which would require using a version so new it wasn&#x27;t even feature frozen much less production-ready, to show off our coming features) and, as long as we were changing two critical layers of the stack simultaneously, we would change all the other layers, too, right down to the OS and hardware &quot;and just do it right&quot;.<p>And I assumed I was just laughing <i>with</i> her--yeah, yeah, very funny--until we both suddenly realized what was actually happening.<p>(And, I don&#x27;t work for her.

(Maybe a funny hack would be to create an ASCII tileset that recreates the appearance of a character-mode display?)<p>And it&#x27;s very hard for me to know at a glance what monsters are, but that&#x27;s presumably just a matter of experience (I immediately know what particular-colored versions of particular letters are, but I haven&#x27;t learned their equivalents in any tileset by heart).<p>Also, not being able to see the whole dungeon at once sort of loses information that NetHack users have traditionally (maybe unfortunately) had access to in character mode: if you can see the whole dungeon inside an 80x24 screen, you know in which directions it&#x27;s worthwhile to search for additional passageways and rooms that you haven&#x27;t discovered yet (because they have to be in directions that would fit on screen!).  In tileset mode with a partial screen view, you don&#x27;t really know where you are relative to the corners of the dungeon level, so you don&#x27;t immediately know whether it&#x27;s worthwhile to search or dig in a particular direction.<p>A couple of minor practical problems with the interface for me: it didn&#x27;t recognize Esc (for example, when prompted to choose a direction for the / command), and unambiguous # commands such as #untrap and #pray weren&#x27;t autocompleted.  It&#x27;s possible to work around the former problem by pressing any non-direction key.  For reasons that aren&#x27;t obvious to me, pressing any arrow key while on top of either an up or down staircase will result in taking the staircase.<p>I should say again that getting NetHack to run in the browser is a really impressive achievement.",1428868438

It will be interesting to see how domain real-estate follows the patterns exhibited in real-estate as the new TLDs become more ubiquitous; will there eventually be a revival of .com similar to the urban revivals we&#x27;ve seen? Or maybe that&#x27;s just stretching the analogy a bit too far :)",1428867624

Extraterrestrial mining projects from conception to first delivery is probably a 20-30 year timeframe. That is way, way outside of what could be reasonably financed on the open market.<p>On the other hand, if you could reasonably get a return on investment in the 5-7 year time frame, then there&#x27;d be no trouble getting financing for each step of the project. However that requires having liquidity events before you&#x27;re able to actually get resources to market, and the only way I see that to be possible is to sell some sort of contract valued by future revenue potential. You see the same problem in remote areas of the Earth where mining efforts take considerable planning, e.g. northern Canada. And we have solutions there: mining claims and a sense of legal ownership of resources that are still in the ground.<p>Break that mining project into 5 to 7 year chunks with a mechanism for contracts exchanging hands inbetween, and the free market will solve the problem of bootstrapping space settlement.",1428866471

Because several of these seem to be the opposite of what I&#x27;ve observed.<p>Testing with a mock object implies that the mock object can generate all the required output that the real object can generate that might have some effect on the consuming code. Not only that, but it assumes that the mock object generates the correct data in ways that cannot generate false positives in the test. This doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re only testing the client logic. You&#x27;re now testing the client logic using services that are ad-hoc and aren&#x27;t guaranteed to behave like the real thing. You&#x27;re testing a fantasy.<p>It is far better to test against the real database. Using a fixture, or a transaction, or some way to use the actual system with representative data. Mocks have their place in very complex services where this is practically impossible. But they don&#x27;t suddenly make things better for testing, or more atomic. IMHO, when you have to use a mock, it should be as a last resort, when you have to sacrifice fidelity for tractability. Your code is coupled in behavior to the services it uses, pretending it isn&#x27;t is just fooling yourself.<p>I have very much the same problem with people who write unit tests against, say SQLite databases, rather than the full DBMS. The complexity of &#x27;masking sure the database is connected and can be queried&#x27; is pretty trivial compared to the complexity of mocking a whole RBMDS interface. Good software engineering will, of course, limit the number of places the database interfaces with (I&#x27;m not suggesting code with SQL statements in strings everywhere, that&#x27;s a straw man). But I&#x27;d not accept mocked tests that exists just to avoid a database connection or because the developer doesn&#x27;t understand how to write a transaction.<p>So I don&#x27;t understand. Either you&#x27;re advocating a very bizarre, and seemingly pathological development style, or you&#x27;re consistently muddying the waters by comparing good programming in your chosen methodology with bad programming in mine, which just misses the point.<p>Here&#x27;s an example then. In your Person object, on a platform with reasonable transaction/fixtures support (like Django). Is it better to write your unit test using a mocked ORM layer, or a fixture with the test data in it?<p>> He is missing perhaps the main benefit of unit tests - which is that, when a bug arises, you can quickly eliminate many possible causes because unit tests against those parts of code have succeeded<p>I&#x27;ve no idea why this is somehow impossible. I write unit tests at various levels of abstraction. If I have module A, calling module B which calls module C, then I need tests for C, B(+C) and A(+B+C). If I get a failure in A, I make sure that there is a test in B that corresponds to the way A is using B, if so, it is a problem with A, not B. If B and C were mocked, I&#x27;d have no way of knowing if the problem was with the mock logic without having to test C, C-mock, B+C-mock, B-mock, A+B-mock.<p>> now has a dependency on all of the code which mutates it<p>This seems a bizarre claim. Does your code have a dependency on everything else that can possibly change what&#x27;s on the screen? If so, how do you deal with that?<p>That&#x27;s why pretending &#x27;global variables&#x27; = &#x27;all central resources&#x27; seems foolish to me.",1428865341

I.e. you build the full class string in code rather than defining separate CSS classes for each component. Your components are obviously named semantically and all relevant CSS styles / transitions / animations are defined inside the component code.",1428865333

For example, I recall hearing a lot of students use it all the time while nervously giving presentations, desperately trying not to de-rail their trains of thought.<p>As geeks tend to be more socially awkward, I&#x27;m fairly certain it actually has less to do with geekiness and more with lack of confidence -- I&#x27;ve seen decidedly non-geeks do it when they&#x27;re nervous.<p>As for the &quot;So, ...&quot; with a pause for dramatic effect:<p>I find that the implications tend to depend on context. I can confirm the use with the meaning of &quot;I will try to explain concepts unfamiliar to you using analogues hopefully more familiar to you and this is going to take me some mental effort&quot; but I disagree that this is specific to geeks, unless you define &quot;geek&quot; as &quot;someone more familiar with a given topic than you&quot;.<p>I can also confirm its use followed by a summary of what the other person said (&quot;So, ... you&#x27;re saying this is a bad idea?&quot;).<p>I don&#x27;t think the use to re-boot a conversation after an awkward pause or to change the topic is as common in German, though other fillers like &quot;Okay, ...&quot; tend to be used the same way.<p>The functions definitely aren&#x27;t unique to English and there is a lot of overlap in the words being used.

[1] He talked about how for certain periods of time, he completely forgot that he existed. Without having anybody to perform his identity to, he had no consistent self or identity.<p>> &quot;I did examine myself,&quot; he said. &quot;Solitude did increase my perception. But here&#x27;s the tricky thing—when I applied my increased perception to myself, I lost my identity. With no audience, no one to perform for, I was just there. There was no need to define myself; I became irrelevant. The moon was the minute hand, the seasons the hour hand. I didn&#x27;t even have a name. I never felt lonely. To put it romantically: I was completely free.&quot;<p>For me personally, this makes me think that the phenomenology of selfhood is very much dependent on perception and others. To be is to be perceived. In the absence of perception, the &quot;I&quot; dissolves.<p>Perhaps &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot; sorta still makes sense as long as you&#x27;re aware of the fact that you&#x27;re thinking. But as the Hermit describes– when you&#x27;re alone for a long enough period, and you&#x27;re not thinking about other people, or what other people will think of you when you return, or what letters you want to write for other people, &quot;I&quot; stops showing up. And therefore &quot;I&quot; does not exist. The entity that is the person is still hanging out in the forest, but he/it has no need for a name or any consistent identity.<p>_____<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201409/the-last-true-hermit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gq.com/news-politics/newsmakers/201409/the-last-t...</a>",1428865297
