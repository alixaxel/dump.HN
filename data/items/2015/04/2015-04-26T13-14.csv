9441756,comment,9441465,9441465,0,0,BadApple1981,,,"Having been in the industry for 15 years, and having been both a hard developer and an engineering manager, my two cents:
1- managing a team of engineers WELL is really hard, and requires a broad range of skills. Granted, there are a lot of bad managers out there, particularly in engineering.
2- managers aren&#x27;t getting paid for their productivity, or even their time. They are getting paid for judgment and accountability. They are accountable for the output of a whole team, and they can only indirectly influence productivity of each engineer.
3- I can say this because I&#x27;m an engineer- lots of engineers (in fact, many of the best ones) are immature and stubborn. That hurts teams, hurts feelings, and inhibits productivity. Don&#x27;t underestimate the difficulty in keeping things running smoothly on interpersonal issues.<p>To the above points, I was a manager for 4 years. My team members said I did a good job. Yet, after sweating in that position for that amount of time, I gladly took a 30% pay cut to be an individual contributor again.",1430056651

Syntax evolution <i>also includes</i> new strange word reorderings, deliberate word omissions, and deliberate word misspellings.<p>I disagree with the other comment about The Culture Industry as an explanation.  That&#x27;s not relevant.  Instead, people are trying to share extra meaning (emotion, irony, etc) through extra channels of new syntax manipulation.<p>Let&#x27;s say a writer wants to be sarcastic when writing out bad reasoning.  Examples:<p>Congress keeps buying tanks the Army does not need.  Why?<p>1) explicit labeling of concept with backreference:<p><i>&quot;It&#x27;s good because it maintains jobs. (That was sarcasm.)&quot;</i><p>2) HTML tag inspired syntax:<p><i>&quot;<sarcasm>It&#x27;s good because it maintains jobs.</sarcasm>&quot;</i><p>3) /s (inspired by Unix command line switch?)<p><i>&quot;It&#x27;s good because it maintains jobs. /s&quot;</i><p>4) grammar incorrect because of missing words<p><i>&quot;Because jobs.&quot;</i><p>(It&#x27;s as if the general public is creating syntax options in English to parallel the computer language verbosity of Objective-C and Java EE to terseness of Perl and Haskell.)<p>That type of word subtraction creates an interesting abruptness that conveys to the reader a meaning of idiocy or lunacy.  Similar phrases can be constructed like &quot;because freedom&quot; or &quot;because science&quot;.<p>Why is the TSA now performing mandatory cavity searches of preschoolers?  &quot;Because freedom.&quot;<p>The substraction of words may have been motivated by the mechanics of 2 thumbs typing on smartphones or the Twitter 140 char limit but I think even desktop users with 100wpm typing speed have adopted it.",1430056166

Executives come out on top because they control the money and payscales.  Sales is often second because they can very easily point to new revenues and say &quot;I brought that in&quot;.  Profit center staff (most Valley engineers) would be somewhere up there because they are at least creating the actual product that the business sells.  Support staff - cleaning, office managers, accounting - bring up the rear because they have the hardest time claiming responsibility for a share of the pie.<p>Within each of those groups you&#x27;ll see normal salary dynamics based on wider market forces and hierarchy.

I always had the impression that places like HN were quick to point out linguistic and grammatical issues, even when they might be viewed as pedantic. And even when the issue that is brought up is subjective, or otherwise based on (linguistic) ideology - like what might be the case in this case. Like for example use of gender-neutral pronouns, which seems to go contrary to normal use, but has some compelling arguments going for them. And although I might be wrong in my assertion that the author <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> refer to someone by such a spelling, am I really so pig-headed and obnoxious that I should be punished so harshly, vote-wise? I am not really whining about down votes (they can&#x27;t be taken back, anyway), but asking if someone should be down voted so much for simply being wrong about something? And being wrong without being willfully ignorant or lazy (like, to give a bland but current example, people who refuse to vaccinate their children in spite of monumental evidence compelling them to do so).<p>Or is perhaps the issue that the linguistic side-track is about a non-English language, on an English speaking site, and so is judged to be too off topic? In that case all I can say is that is completely on me if only that initial mention was enough to be too off topic. But it is only partly on me when considering the whole discussion, since discussions take on a life on their own. Especially when they turn out to be somewhat controversial. :)",1430053283
