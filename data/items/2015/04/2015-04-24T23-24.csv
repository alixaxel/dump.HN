9436595,comment,9436263,9436263,0,0,minthd,,,"A detailed criticsm/explanation of this is here:<p>&quot;Not OP&#x27;s fault, but the headline and the story itself are extremely inaccurate. This post should be labelled &quot;misleading.&quot;<p>The story&#x27;s deck says: &quot;Scientists at Cardiff University and Kings College London have found out what causes asthma and how to switch it off &quot;<p>This is not true. The researchers found a pathway that can trigger some parts of asthma, but the researchers do not claim that this is the cause of asthma. Most asthma researchers now believe that the disease has probably many different causes, all leading to a similar set of symptoms.<p>In the story itself, the reporter writes &quot;...researchers at Cardiff University and Kings College London identified which cells cause the airways to narrow when triggered by irritants like pollution.&quot;<p>This as well is not true. The researchers looked at airway smooth muscle cells, but it was already known that these cells are responsible for the constriction seen in asthma. What this team did discover is a type of receptor in these cells that can trigger this constriction.<p>&quot;Crucially, drugs already exist which can deactivate the cells. They are known as calcilytics and are used to treat people with osteoporosis. &quot;<p>These aren&#x27;t drugs, because none of them have been approved by any government agency. And they definitely haven&#x27;t been prescribed by any doctor to treat osteoporosis. In fact, many have been abandoned as possible treatments for osteoporosis. Also they don&#x27;t deactivate the smooth muscle cells. They deactivate the receptors in those cells.<p>Finally, the claim that asthma could be cured in five years is extremely problematic. First, even if these molecules get approved as asthma drugs, they would not cure the disease. People would still have asthma. They&#x27;d just have a new medication they&#x27;d take to prevent symptoms such as wheezing and breathing problems. And, going back to what I wrote above, this is probably not going to treat all asthmatics because there isn&#x27;t a singular root cause of the disease.<p>And the biggest issue here, and what the story leaves out, is that study, in part, involved studies of a mouse model of allergic asthma--one type of the disease. Mouse models are great for pointing in a direction, but they are not people. And for asthma, mouse models don&#x27;t have the greatest success rate in finding drug leads. So until there are clinical data on these compounds, it is way too early to call these treatments for asthma. And definitely not cures.<p>Again, this isn&#x27;t OP&#x27;s fault, but this story is extremely misleading.

9436592,comment,9436416,9436416,0,0,briandear,,,"I disagree with this nonsense. I was a photojournalist for Reuters during the tail end of the film era; 1996-2002 and the issue with black subjects had nothing to do with color balance but of the latitude of the film; we used Fuji almost exclusively and since I did tons of sports and low light spot news, It was mostly 800 speed occasionally pushed hard.<p>Shooting NBA meant I had mostly black subjects. The film didn&#x27;t discriminate: in most arenas if the time, we shot at 500/2.8; for a darker arena, we&#x27;d increase the processing time (or if we had an especially important shot, increase the chemical temperature, effectively overclocking the processing.) my point is that dark skin or light, the color balance made no difference; it was about exposure. Since we held shutter speed and aperture constant (2.8 was the fastest aperture for 400mm lenses and anything below 1/500th would get motion blur,) our exposures were relatively constant regardless of the subject&#x27;s skin color. The problem is if you have a bunch of white guys and one black guy, auto-metering would expose in such a way as to render the scene equal to an 18% grey card. So the black guy would be under exposed. However, if you took a photo with 20 black guys and 1 white guy, the white guy would look like he was made out of white light: he&#x27;d be dramatically overexposed because autometering it exposed for 18% grey. If you had used an incident light meter, generally the scenes would be fine because the meter wouldn&#x27;t be trying to &#x27;grey card&#x27; the scene.<p>As far as Jean Luc and his &#x27;racist&#x27; Kodachrome, I suspect that&#x27;s apocryphal. Kodachrome is notoriously difficult to expose correctly; meaning you typically want to expose for highlights because it has a very narrow latitude and blasting out highlights is a real concern. There&#x27;s nothing racist about it, it is just a very difficult film to light correctly, especially if he were shooting on location in Africa.<p>But what do I know, I am a white guy so I obviously don&#x27;t quite understand the struggle to make everything into some kind of racist conspiracy.<p>The fact is that if film were racist, Spike Lee and others would have been screaming about it. This is the first I&#x27;ve ever heard of this theory and I was a film junkie for a long time as well as a fan of Ernest Dickerson and Bob Richardson; never once have those guys mentioned racist color balance. The argument is just absurd.<p>If we want to talk about racism in Hollywood, we have about a million potential topics, but film stock isn&#x27;t one of them. What next, lenses are racist?",1429919881

Quitting a six-figure job, forgoing income for a year-plus, taking the risks of never getting liftoff or financing, taking another year or more at way-below-market angel-funded salary... this is not &quot;marginally more risk&quot; than someone who comes in with a salary from day one at a company that is in motion.  The early employee has much less opportunity cost (and -- worth noting -- can also pull out much more easily if things seem to be moving sideways).<p>Furthermore the theory of &quot;implied pot odds&quot; applies.  You&#x27;re not just getting the returns on the deal, you&#x27;re getting all of the career and relationship equity of having been a key player on a huge success.<p>I would argue that early-stage roles, if you can tolerate the opportunity cost over the near term, are one of the better deals going, and likely (though only arguably) better than being an under-ready founder with a high likelihood of failure.",1429919726

9436565,comment,9432949,9433854,0,0,kbenson,,,"I think it&#x27;s trying to be <i>too</i> magical.  At this point it either seems to work, or something triggers it&#x27;s pattern matching wrong and it&#x27;s really hard to figure out what or why.  I think giving back a <i>little</i> of the simpleness in favor of more control is worthwhile.  For example, if the example portions that were formatting were differentiated from the data matching, it&#x27;s not too complicated but intent is much clearer.<p>For example, if the rules were: example content must be contained within braces, and any braces within the example content need to be escaped, it&#x27;s clear.  At that point, your example becomes:<p><pre><code>  {example1.org}, {path/index.html}
</code></pre>
It would still probably just return &quot;wwwexample.4, g/hijklmnop&quot; for the last example though, because it&#x27;s ambiguous as to whether you want just the end of the url, or the whole thing.  Allowing regex markup for more explicit matching would make it clearer still, but your example still causes problems until you go all the way to positive lookbehind assertions.  At that point I need to learn all that, I might as well just use perl:<p><pre><code>  # perl -pe &#x27;s{.*https?://([^/]+)(/\S*).*}{$1, $2}&#x27; /tmp/foo
  example1.org, /path/index.html

It took whole separate scenes (riot grrrl, among others) to push those boundaries out to include more diversity. There are now reasonably large feminist hard core and punk scenes, as well as lots of off-shoots. I just caught Sleater-Kinney live a few days ago; they&#x27;re, I guess they might be called, second generation feminist punks, and they had a huge sold out crowd.<p>Punk and hard core were also occasionally ambiguous about LGBTQ folks, even though several quite important bands had gay members (Husker Du, The Dicks, Big Boys, etc.) or were vocally supportive of gay rights. Bad Brains, featured in this video, and among the best loved hard core bands in history, had a well-known falling out with MDC over some hateful comments H.R. (singer of Bad Brains) made about Randy &quot;Biscuit&quot; Turner from Big Boys. &quot;Queercore&quot; is now a thing that has a name, and being gay isn&#x27;t a thing to keep secret in the modern punk and hard core world. I don&#x27;t know if H.R. is still a homophobic asshole. Some people grow out of that stuff.<p>I think we can reasonably say that working and middle class white dudes aren&#x27;t renowned for being inclusive, but some try harder than others. And, of course, one could also argue that part of the reason there are few women or people of color is because this particular art form was born of a very specific experience...and that experience is that of a bunch of young, angry, working and middle class white dudes. Early hip hop scene films feature predominantly young, angry, poor, black dudes, probably for similar reasons.<p>That said, there are racist/sexist/homophobic hard core bands. There are hard core bands that actively promote white supremacy, various bigoted &quot;Christian&quot; values, etc. The bands featured in this video aren&#x27;t really among them, however. Even the &quot;skinhead&quot; bands in the film, like Agnostic Front and the Cro-Mags, are of the &quot;non-racist&quot; breed...maybe even anti-racist. I&#x27;m not deeply familiar with any of them, so I wouldn&#x27;t want to make too many sweeping pronouncements about how they feel about racism/sexism/homophobia (except the Bad Brains thing, because that story includes one of my favorite bands/artists as the target of their homophobia, so I&#x27;m familiar with that story).",1429917946

Our javascript implementation of Docker&#x27;s libchan library. It implements the same kind of semantics that Go channels have, but over the network, and using node streams. Since it is based on the capabilities of SPDY, it allows you to embed additional channels in messages. So i could request a page, but give you a return channel to write the document to. instead of waiting for the response.<p>- Graft [<a href=""https://github.com/graftjs/graft"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/graftjs/graft</a>].
Our attempt to determine what microservices taken all the way to the browser would look like. It&#x27;s a higher level library built on top of jschan. The idea is to be able to use node streams interchangeably on both sides of the pipe, with the communication managed by libchan ... and work invisibly over SPDY or websockets or whatever.<p>Unfortunately, SPDY was replaced by http2, which meant that libchan went under construction for a bit while the library support was figured out. At the same time, io.js happened. And now there&#x27;s a very fastly evolving streams spec that is feeding on the whatwg effort to standardise a stream spec for the browser and node.<p>I am going to take up the mantle again, but there needs to be some settling of the ecosystem first. =\",1429917097

Miserable job: two days opening at 7 am; two days closing at 11 pm; one day starting at 9am. I was working Sat-Mon-Tues-Thurs-Fri. I was off on Sunday and Wed. Look how miserable was it: low pay, odd timings, odd days off.<p>Then I found another job that was paying $13 per hour in 2002. It was a security guard job. I could read books at work, and walk around. Sure, it is a miserable job compared to a programmar gig; but better than my retail job.<p>If you are a student, working part time in retail or in any service job, your experience is not miserable: you are getting pocket money, after all.

If you are an adult working in these places, you see people without health insurance, working two jobs, lack of sleep, unhealthy people.<p>Psychological impact is tremendous. And journalists, researchers don&#x27;t compute the cost of psychological impact, as individuals bear the cost.<p>When I was working as a security guard, one day a colleague did not show up for work. A week later, we found that he died of cardiac arrest. This guy was a weightlifting champion in his younger days. He was paying child support, working two jobs: working 80 hours a week, in odd time schedules.<p>This working model is exported to other countries, to other industries from the service sector.

Levels of these cations in body fluids correlate with asthma severity. We show that polycations and elevated extracellular calcium activate the human recombinant and native calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR), leading to intracellular calcium mobilization, cyclic adenosine monophosphate breakdown, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation in airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells. These effects can be prevented by CaSR antagonists, termed calcilytics. Moreover, asthmatic patients and allergen-sensitized mice expressed more CaSR in ASMs than did their healthy counterparts. Indeed, polycations induced hyperreactivity in mouse bronchi, and this effect was prevented by calcilytics and absent in mice with CaSR ablation from ASM. Calcilytics also reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation in allergen-sensitized mice in vivo. These data show that a functional CaSR is up-regulated in asthmatic ASM and targeted by locally produced polycations to induce hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. Thus, calcilytics may represent effective asthma therapeutics.</i>",1429916617
