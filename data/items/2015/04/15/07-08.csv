9379469,comment,9376086,9379419,0,0,luch,,,"I live in France, where nuclear energy is dominant, and I can tell there are some serious issues with nuclear power.<p>First, nuclear can be extremely inefficient since it&#x27;s heavily centralized : I have friends working for energy distributors telling me they can lose more than half the energy between the power plant and the client&#x27;s house.<p>More importantly, nuclear waste disposal and power plant cleaning costs are heavily underestimated. I&#x27;ve worked for the CEA, the French nuclear agency where they invented the first French atomic bomb and reactor in the sixties, and some experiments aren&#x27;t still cleaned up yet in 2010&#x27;s (the current objective is to fully clean up the laboratory in 2025-2040). That is a massive cost which is not factored into the kW price.<p>I think decentralized technologies are the way to go regarding energy (using local loops and &quot;smart grids&quot;) even if they aren&#x27;t viable now (solar panels cost more in energy to produce than they give back during exploitation for example).",1429084708

The only thing I have to do now is get used to the emacs command equivalents for the quick edit jobs. For example, in vim I can open a file to a specific line, delete that line and then the first 5 characters of the next 50 lines, and exit the editor in just a few keystrokes, while in emacs I&#x27;d still be playing with C-h a and googling.

However, since the electricity business is slow moving, low margin and very capital intensive it&#x27;s clear why everyone is very interested in any new potentially disruptive technology. Imagine owning a peaker power plant that you&#x27;ve paid for in full using debt and generates a little profit each year under the condition that it can be amortized for 15 more years - if someone built the equivalent of a peaker plant made of batteries, even in 2025, you&#x27;d still go under.
