When words like &quot;the deal&quot;, &quot;in talks to buy&quot;, &quot;to acquire&quot;, etc. appear, it&#x27;s a pretty good bet that it has something to do with an acquisition, and also a good bet that volatility will spike.<p>A lot of people here are saying &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t bet $2.4M on that false positive rate&quot;, but that&#x27;s not how traders think.  You only have to be right more often than you&#x27;re wrong (or alternatively, very right to offset being wrong a lot more often) - &quot;betting&quot; is exactly what they do for a living.  It&#x27;s pretty much the perfect application for statistical machine learning - users never see how bad your algorithms are, and so it doesn&#x27;t matter if the quality is worse than a human as long as the speed is better.",1430027973

9440700,comment,9439286,9440699,0,0,humanarity,,,"<i></i>continuing<i></i><p>It&#x27;s like the universe at galactic scale: broadly the same in all directions as far as you look.<p>And if I&#x27;m on this one peak of many peaks, then if I go off searching, it&#x27;s likely I&#x27;ll find other peaks comparable to where I was. So the first unintuitive result is that search is likely to produce comparably stable conditions, instead of the &quot;shattering fear and chaos&quot; which may be feared to result from leaving a local peak.<p>The second result is based on the following observation: the peaks are distributed across a range of heights that&#x27;s modelled well by a bell curve (based on subjective metrics of personal utility). The very small and the very large peaks are rare. This has a number of relevant consequences. Firstly, it&#x27;s roughly as hard to fall off the cliff and into chaos as it is to ascend to the heights of huge success, which reinforces our first unintuitive result that search mostly preserves the equilibrium. Because comparable conditions are the most common, you&#x27;re more likely to keep finding them than anything distressingly (or delightfully) too different.<p>The second relevant consequence for our discussion of optimization of your lifepeak is because more successful and less successful than you are more rare, it&#x27;s unlikely where you are starting out in your search is anything close to a global optima. In fact it&#x27;s overwhelming more likely it&#x27;s just a normal peak, no matter what narratives you attach to it (like the story I told above, as good as that sounds, it&#x27;s still overhwlemingly likely that&#x27;s mostly normal). The great thing about this is there&#x27;s a whole bunch of peaks out there that are better than where we currently are. And we give can find them if we try. We give ourselves a chance to find them only if we try.<p>The other great thing about looking for higher peaks is, and this is similar to the argument about why you should only focus on the biggest problems, that great peaks are mostly unoccupied. The higher the peak is, the less life is up there, because it&#x27;s themodynamically harder to reach it.<p>And thermodynamics applies everywhere. Well, everywhere that matters for optimizing your life peak. I.e, it&#x27;s unlikely you&#x27;ll want to be on the edge of our knowledge inside the event horizon of a black hole. But personal utility is subjective, so...Maybe that works for you.<p>These two unintuitive results, first, that by searching you are more likely to find comparable conditions than worse or better ones, and second, that where you are is unlikely to be the best and there are other better ones out there that have paths untrod and are unoccupied, (peaks that are waiting just for you), provide a compelling reason for us to search from where we are.<p>And if you lay breadcrumbs, you might even be able to trek your way back.<p>This &quot;existence proof&quot; of a better life waiting over the horizon of travel, is not constructive.<p>It doesn&#x27;t actually tell us how to produce such a better life.<p>Tho, strangely, these results do offer some heuristic algorithms for search.<p>1. Because where you are is unlikely to be the best, you are better off pivoting if you are desiring a higher utility co-ordinate for yourself. And you don&#x27;t even have to worry about &quot;am I up to this&quot; because you were &quot;up to it&quot; to find your current peak, and given the relevant characteristics of the landscape (uniformity and scale), this means you are up to it to stumble, however hopelessly you may feel you stumble, upon comparable conditions elsewhere! If however, you have your heart set on &quot;better conditions&quot; then the corollary of this is that, while travel may &quot;open your eyes&quot; to lower energy paths through the landscape, the Universal Rules, uniformity and scale, mean that you will need a similar additional quantum of energy to raise your peak abroad as you will at home.<p>Let that sink in. It&#x27;s actually not going to be any easier, thermodynamically speaking in the aggregate, to get your life peak better if you travel far away than if you don&#x27;t. Because this is a law of aggregate statistics it goes hand in hand with all its individuated exceptions, and it still operates: broadly speaking, you&#x27;ve just as much chance of finding a higher peak in your neighbourhood than across the globe.<p>This unintuitive result has other nice corollaries in that it&#x27;s not really easier to make it if you&#x27;re overseas than if you&#x27;re at home, contrary to the sometimes myth that it is, a result which you can contribute as a reason to variously stay or to go, as you please.<p>So returning to our second algorithm heuristic for lifepeak search, it works to start by realizing that there will be additional energy requirements to improve your life, wherever you are.<p>Now, this is where it gets really interesting.<p>Someone has said that perspective is 80 IQ points. That simply presenting something from a perspective that works has huge utility in itself. Perspective is a super power. You can enhance or limit your inherent abilities with your choice of perspective.<p>In chemistry, we call this a catalyst. Perspective lowers the barrier of entry to different achievements, making it easier to unlock higher lifepeaks. Perspective flattens the energy landscape, allowing to see further.<p>And travel, can give you, perspective.<p>That&#x27;s probably one of it&#x27;s most powerful operations.<p>And it&#x27;s not some mythical hand-waving argument that travel gives you perspective just so, it&#x27;s actually because (cue hand-waving mythical argument) the conceptual lag between the apparent nature of things (their difference) in other places, and their unobvious inherent sameness (the Universal Rules), gives you space. You get mental space where even though you feel you are in a different place, you are actually in inherently the same place, aggregately speaking.<p>And when you have space you are free to move around.<p>And being free to move around is freedom to change your perspective. That&#x27;s the definition of perspective, mental space to move around in. And it&#x27;s the very appearance of things you find in travel (the apparent difference of which hides their inherent sameness), it&#x27;s the very lag before you catch up to that, before you learn that patterns, which gives you that mental space to gain perspective to flatten the energy landscape to trek your way to that new, higher, peak.<p>So being in the unknown is not mythically just better for you, it actually works by this mechanism to make it easier for you.<p>It&#x27;s still going to take more energy to get to a higher peak, though maybe you&#x27;re new found perspective has made that energy requirement less than it otherwise would have been, for you, and because you&#x27;ve learned something (by not yet learning how similar things really are) it is easier for you to go to that new higher life peak.<p>Time here to offer a word of caution. What makes it easier to go up also makes it easier to go down. And many a foreign expat in a faraway land has succumbed to one form of burnout or another. The fresh perspective is not a magical cure all: it&#x27;s a powerful tool, and it&#x27;s up to you and your choices what results you produce with that power you chose to give yourself. So if you&#x27;re thinking travel will solve all your problems, maybe it will, and yet just go cautiously that you have enough resourcefulness and resilience to keep yourself away from the chasms, because even though that landscape flattens now, when it finally straightens out as your learn the inherent sameness, those chasms will seem mighty deep, I imagine, so, buyer beware.<p>Finally, returning to the search algorithm heurstic suggested by this line of reasoning, we have: keep your eyes open, stay loose and let go, don&#x27;t try to see the sameness straight away, see the difference, because you&#x27;re going to catch up anyway and the longer you stay in the unknown the more perspective you have. This is the fourth unintuitive result: spend time in ignorance longer in a new culture, let the difference go to work on you. Learn less language, not more, because being in the dark will keep you on your toes and also keep your perspective fresh, and if you&#x27;re searching for that higher life peak, and fresher perspective is one of the things which works to have in your toolchain.<p>Now these two heuristic search algorithms we&#x27;ve presented:<p>1. Pivot. Just go\n2. Stay loose. Stay dumb,<p>(which conveniently seem to encode rigorously the very hippy traveler aesthetic practised by the most seasoned nomads and incurable wanderers -- likely hooked on the perspective high),<p>neither of these, guarantee you&#x27;ll find higher peaks, what you get is up to you. And maybe you&#x27;ll create your own algorithms to optimize your travel experience, or even to find higher peaks in your neighbourhood. That would be awesome. Heed the general principles above is likely a place to start with that works.<p>And, finally, something must be said to address this question.<p>What if you search and you find that you were at the apex already?<p>Sit up there and have a cup of tea? \nGaze down superiously at your surrounding kingdom and minions?<p>Or maybe you got to ask yourself, if you wanted to leave what was the Everest in that landscape, maybe you&#x27;re in the wrong space?<p>So, the remedy for that is ... more travelling to gain clarity for what kind of space might work better for you.<p>Peace out.",1430027776
9440699,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,humanarity,,,"Wow, I got my first &quot;That comment was too long&quot;. Okay, I&#x27;m breaking this into two replies because it&#x27;s just too good to not put here.<p>I ended up getting a better job overseas (paid to research and code what I want). And then I quit that and ended up getting an even better opportunity after travelling again, and after a fun period interning at a magazine, then making investment banker money for building an ecommerce site.<p>I think the more glibly you express it, (&quot;Quit your job! Travel the world!&quot; would have to be one of the more concise expressions) the more possible meanings that statement can encode, so the more open it is to interpretation.<p>I think the essence of being successful doing that (by essence I mean one main cause and requirement) is simply the willingness to leave one opportunity to find a better one.<p>From a thermodynamic viewpoint, the more you raise your energy (unbound state), the more possible energy states you can access. The more &quot;stable&quot; things are, the less energy states (read possibilities) you will access.<p>From an &quot;multivariate optimization&quot; perspective (how you maximize your utility over a couple of metrics relevant to you with the space of possibilities some kind of undulating surface) you are searching the landscape of possibilities, the willingness to &quot;pivot&quot; off a local maxima and begin searching again is a strategy that makes finding higher peaks possible.<p>Diving deeper, heuristically the landscape is large (there are many possible configurations of your axes of utility, i.e, many possible situations), and also mostly self-similar (because there are certain rules which operate in the world which cycle and combine to produce familiar patterns, for example, human psychology, means that, broadly, people&#x27;s reactions to a given situation will mostly be the same across cultures, and their motivations will be similar as well, such as in aggregate people are motivated by their fears (of not having enough, of shame) and by their ego (competing with other egos), and by their culture (social norms, shared history and cultural identity), and by what the narrative they choose for themselves (hero, victim, &quot;normal&quot;, &quot;outcast&quot;, &quot;individual&quot; roughly corresponding to high school film tropes, thou becoming more multifaceted and specialised with age -- people become niche experts at being who they are, is another way of saying habits become ingrained). So these personal identities and cultural identities drive people, and these identities are shaped by forces uniform across the world, and people drive the world, so the world, in most ways you look, is essentially the same. It is also very very different, yet the difference is obvious. The sameness merits mention because it is one of those &quot;hacks&quot; that is not always inherently obvious, and even when it is, there&#x27;s a lot of depth to the self-similar characters of different places, and a lot of utility to be gained by learning about what&#x27;s similar wherever you are.<p>So back to the &quot;optimization&quot; analogy, if we are walking a landscape that has two characteristics, it&#x27;s large and mostly uniform, there are some consequences suggested by these observations. If I&#x27;m on a local peak in a large landscape (i.e, I have one a many possible jobs in many possible places), and that landscape is mostly uniform, then there&#x27;s probably a lot of other peaks even a far way away.",1430027743

9440694,comment,9431368,9437773,0,0,dang,,,"Thanks for helping to improve HN! We need all the help we can get.<p>There has never been a rule against downvoting for disagreement on HN. (Perhaps the people who think this are mistakenly applying the rule from Reddit, a much better-known site.) But that doesn&#x27;t mean just any kind of downvoting is ok. For example, downvoting a comment that says 2+2=5 is ok (unless it was quoting Dostoevsky!) But downvoting a substantive comment merely because you don&#x27;t like the same things as the author is not ok. We see this a lot, for example, in programming language debates.<p>Some users want us to formalize the downvote policy in a precise rule, but we don&#x27;t have a precise rule. Here&#x27;s what we do say about downvotes. First, when you see a comment unfairly in the grey, be a good community member and provide a corrective upvote. Most comments that unfairly dip into grey get corrected this way.<p>Second, when you get downvoted, resist the temptation to strike back. Getting downvoted excites emotion. It stings a little, and the mind recoils from the idea that one might have deserved it. The way to respond as an HN user is to take the hit, review your comment to see what might have evoked it, adjust future comments when you see anything, and shrug it off when you don&#x27;t.<p>If you want more clarification of community norms around downvoting, I&#x27;ve been impressed by brudgers&#x27; recent few comments on it and by dragonwriter&#x27;s comments in <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9317916"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9317916</a>.

In those days (1991) we thought a cup in a keyboard would be too big.\nActually the new placement bellow not between the g and h key (long before it was a product) made the space for it... but we were to timid for the big style tops for years.  the first ones were a chloroniated butyl that replace the awful protoypes that were slippery santoprene%$&$#,,,, but the very sticky butyl (that saved the product from sure death) were actually formulated by my father as the last consulting gig of his life... \nunfortunately they absorbed oil over a few months from fingers ... I tried everything and the bumpy one is nylon trying to mimic the amazingly gripy fish skin we found in Japan... the larger cup and domes of today are better still!",1430024647

You or I could, if we had a lot of money, start making markets in any stock we desired to, just by getting a brokerage account and sending the right orders to the exchange.  A market maker is a participant like any other and may not be a formal role.)<p>What would probably happen is tweaking their risk exposure: be less willing to play large resting bids/asks for large positions close to the NBBO, and instead either resize them or layer them over several price points.<p>My feeling with regards to the fairness of this is that one should not offer to sell 4,000 PUTS for e.g. Zynga at $1 in May 2015 unless one is prepared to accept delivery of 400k shares of Zynga in return for $400k.  Some options market participant is signaling their willingness to do that, or something close to it.  They are theoretically responsible adults who know the risks.  If that trade blows up in their face, and they take to the Internet to decry the unfairness of it all, I will not be maximally sympathetic.  (Full disclosure: I was probably their counterparty a time or two buying the option on &quot;Zynga blows up in next short-increment-of-time&quot; and did poorly.)",1430024642
