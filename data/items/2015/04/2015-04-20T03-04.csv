The game was designed for and taken from study for use in this one -- the results were nearly the same. The other study came back with similar results due to the structure of the game favoring ADHD individuals for level 1 and favoring individuals without ADHD for level 2.<p><i>The results in the original study were nearly the same proportionally and the game was found to favor the performance of an individual with ADHD.</i><p>The linked study, in fact, goes on to misrepresent the study it references in stating it was conducted &quot;to quantify the performance of people with ADHD characteristics,&quot; when in fact the study stated it was conducted to describe &quot;the development and the testing of a virtual environment that is capable to quantify the influence of red-green versus blue-yellow colour stimuli on the performance of people.&quot;<p>The referenced study concluded: &quot;The game proved to be a user-friendly tool capable to detect and quantify the influence of color on the performance of people executing tasks that require attention and showed to be attractive for people with ADHD&quot;",1429502374

Including you, michaelochurch - perhaps especially you, since your view is pretty far off the mainstream.  Personally, I&#x27;m glad that you share your perspective, even though I disagree with much of it, because it&#x27;s only through having a dissonance of voices that we can get to some approximation of the truth.<p>But what you&#x27;re asking for in this thread, with the accusations about Dick Costolo and Evan Spiegel and then the claim that a moderator of the site holds a biased, rose-tinted view, is for readers to consider your view of reality as reality itself.  It is not.  It&#x27;s a <i>perspective</i> on reality, an interpretation, just like everyone else&#x27;s post is.  It&#x27;s fine to leave out the qualifiers and just assert a view as fact as a rhetorical device - I&#x27;ve certainly been guilty of this a lot, and PG does it all the time.  But most people, when an alternate viewpoint or interpretation is presented, will at least listen, consider their points, and possibly adapt their worldview.<p>It doesn&#x27;t advance the discourse or our understanding of the truth to say &quot;You&#x27;re just biased&quot;, because all it invites are posts that say &quot;No, <i>you&#x27;re</i> biased.&quot;  Duh.  Everybody is biased.  The point of critical thinking is to take in a bunch of different viewpoints, understand everyone&#x27;s biases (<i>including</i> our own), and then work out what&#x27;s actually going on.",1429502314

If you are trying to refactor some piece of code, you only have to make sure that the callers within the said class are modified to guarantee that the codebase is not broken.<p>I don&#x27;t think a lot of people understand that maintainers in the real world do not have the time to read and understand every line of your code. And the toughest part of doing software maintenance is figuring out how much you can safely ignore. I feel qualifiers like &quot;private&quot; were designed to help with this problem.<p>I also severely dislike the architecture proposed by the author with loosely coupled services talking over a socket. This style of code is only maintainable if you understand the entire system inside and out. For example, lets say the maintainer receives a ticket that says &#x27;Report X has wrong data&#x27;. She will start investigation with the question : &#x27;Why does it have wrong data ?&#x27;.

And they are going to do it, because they have to do it.<p>And for some of these people who are homeless, they are going to do what they do, because they feel they have to do it...<p>In any case, getting that thing, whatever it is, can go the easy way, or the hard way.

We can put incentives out there, punishments, and all sorts of things, but in the end, they really do have to resolve to do things differently, or it really won&#x27;t happen.<p>Every year, a few of these people get there.  One day, they see something, experience something that brings that resolution about!  And with that comes motivation, and with that motivation comes the doing of things differently.<p>Nobody but them knows when this is, and often they don&#x27;t even know when this is.<p>And until they get there, it&#x27;s the easy way, or the hard way.<p>If we look at the cost of this, those costs can be low, average, or high, depending on how often it&#x27;s the easy way or the hard way.<p>And when they get there, how much potential remains?  That too is determined by the easy way and the hard way.<p>So when we give, we are helping to pay down those costs.

It&#x27;s asking for two days per month in situations where there are presently <i>no</i> days per month. If someone in management is focused exclusively on what the next feature that&#x27;s being implemented is—what things cause a developer pain isn&#x27;t ever going to get captured by that. Probably at least half of the time, by the time I work out a bug in a third-party (or even first-party) library, I already have a hack or workaround. The cheapest thing, in the extreme short-term, is for me to just go with the workaround, and let every future developer experience the same pain. Of <i>course</i> this is a bad decision, but I suspect this is part of what is motivating the author of our manifesto.<p>Of course, the downside to <i>not</i> sending things upstream (and contributing to FOSS in general) is that developers end up solving the same stuff over and over again. I can, off the top of my head, think of a couple problems <i>I&#x27;ve</i> solved myself multiple time, across multiple employers. Wasted time.<p>edit: to be clear, I see your point, I think: the spirit here is what we&#x27;re after, not rigid adherence to 2 days / month, and it fair to say that perhaps the link should speak to that, lest someone read it too literally.<p>Also, keep in mind that it takes a good bit of work: if you patch a third-party dep, you need to somehow deploy/integrate that patch into your process in the meantime; you need whatever approvals internally you need to upstream the change; you need to ensure the patch is reasonable (e.g., not a hack) to upstream; you need to actually send to upstream and deal with any feedback from upstream (and in some cases, hope the upstream is even still alive). It can be several months later that upstream finally accepts the patch and cuts a release, and then you need to upgrade to that release.",1429500030

We have stupid unchecked nil object errors come up in our code bases all the time. Swift will ensure that does not happen again.
