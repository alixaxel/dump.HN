9326255,comment,9325796,9325796,0,0,whoopdedo,,,"Scroll bars stand in an uncomfortable place with one foot on the WM side and the other in the application. The user wants to be able to control the size, scale, and position of the window without asking permission from the app. (And who was the evil programmer who gave web sites the ability to disable zooming? But I digress.) But an app that&#x27;s at the mercy of the operating system for drawing its scroll bars is going to lose usability if it wants to provide infinite scrolling, or simulate a slide-show with vertical position. In those cases it would be better to let the app control the appearance of the scroll bars.<p>Which is to say, the regular window scroll bar that we&#x27;re familiar with is being overloaded for two different purposes: to interact with the app and to interact with the WM. Perhaps we should have two scroll bars to avoid this confusion?",1428289129

9326244,comment,9325501,9326025,0,0,zarriak,,,"A major advantage to putting libraries together is making the code that is able to be the glue between the different libraries. It usually is the part that defines the structure of the app overall, allowing you create solutions to your needs that are not available to you in large frameworks. You can implement the same things in Angular or Ember, but you will be sacrificing choices that will result in the problems present in the author&#x27;s article. The inherent formulaic approach lends itself to extending the use of things that worked in the code base to places they shouldn&#x27;t be. This is significantly decreased when you are handling the libraries, because they force you to think on a more fundamental level of the approach you need to take.<p>Take this basic idea of what an app does (I use code in this context to mean js that was written by you.)<p>Input -> The code -> Output<p>Frameworks: The code exists in all three areas, resulting in having to change all three areas of the code instead of one.<p>Libraries: The code exists separate of the input and output, allowing one to make changes to any of the three areas without having to change much (if anything) in the way the code works. This (in theory and usually in practice) also makes testing easier to develop even if the code wasn&#x27;t designed with testing in mind.",1428288957

9326242,comment,9325823,9326016,0,0,techjuice,,,"You make some great points, I have also corrected Dreamworks to Pixar.  Yes, there are over 7 billion people but everyone does not get the feeling of being average which is fine.  I used to have this feeling but destroyed it a long time ago by challenging myself and working with others to get a more well rounded perspective on things.  When I got this feeling it was due to not being challenged enough in life, or going to work and doing the same thing over and over again.  Nothing is more boring than stalling in terms of learning new things everyday and when you think of where will I be in 10 years and you see yourself doing exactly what your doing now with no new goals or achievements being met it normally changes you pretty quick. If you like to see what can happen if you really put some effort into trying new things and not giving up when it appears to get too hard, the results are normally breath taking.  These can be things like buying your first car with cash, creating a new product at work, helping a child learn something new, completing a community project, and many more things.<p>If you are competitive then striving to become the best you can be comes naturally.  Helping others on your way to the top also comes naturally as to make it there you have to have the help of others since it cannot be done alone.  The good life is relative to ones goals in life, thinking outside of the box goes against the status quo as it is a different way of doing something that has not been done.<p>Normally on your way to continuous self-improvement and helping build up others around you become a leader in your field, company, group, etc. without even thinking about it.  No need to try to be the next so and so, it is better to be yourself and enhance your potential at a pace that keeps you challenged and on your toes.  The world is better off with unique leaders, versus people not being their genuine self when trying to lead change and improve things for people around them.",1428288891

9326227,comment,9325501,9325501,0,0,ascotan,,,"Major issues I have with angular:<p>1. Doesn&#x27;t play well with jquery.<p>Digest cycles and event passing don&#x27;t mix.  With any significant jquery plugin you end up with $timeout(0) hacks (with or without the jquery being wrapped in a directive). Since jQuery is the foundation of pretty much everything, this is a torpedo that sinks the battleship.  In addition, pulling in jQuery plugins (awesome ones!) requires a major hackathon of wrapping the code in a directive, figuring out why the events are always triggering, then throwing some $timeout(0) hacks in there. ship it!<p>2. No concept of M (model) in MVC/MVVC/MTV/M??<p>Data in the directives, data in the controllers, data in the services. oh my! Once your app reaches a certain complexity you&#x27;ll be doing WTF&#x27;s as to where a $scope.variable is actually being defined. (Oh i see it was defined in a controller inside a directive that was inserted into the DOM dynamically via a controller!?...)<p>3. When things go wrong you have to dig too deep<p>Want to make a recursive directive? Good luck reading the docs on the $compile phase. There are too many times that when something goes wrong with angular, you end up in a deep well of tears trying to figure out why it&#x27;s not working.  This creates a productivity problem.<p>Minor issues I have with angular:<p>1. DOM pollution<p>old schoolers see adding non-standard tags in the HTML as &#x27;code smell&#x27; for the same reason that we no longer do &#x27;onclick=alert(&#x27;hi&#x27;)&#x27;. Part of the reason that this stuff was replaced with $(&#x27;id&#x27;).click() was that it created tight coupling between the HTML and the dynamic code.  By inserting non-standard tags into HTML which requires the use of a &#x27;compiler&#x27; you are no longer separating the concerns of &#x27;presentation&#x27;, &#x27;structure&#x27; and &#x27;dynamic code&#x27;. I personally find it distasteful, however, I can live with it (like a stinky roommate).<p>2. Slow unit testing<p>One of the most touted features of angular is it&#x27;s testability. However, 1) virtually every angular component out there has no unit tests and 2) testing directives and mocking out features is so time consuming that it brings development to a crawl. I find that the mix of time spent on testing vs coding is 50/50.  That is that for 1 day of coding you&#x27;ll put in a full day of writing unit tests.  The reason is that testing angular is so complicated that it takes that long to get it right. Unit tests are always a good time investment, and that investment is not 0. However, if feel that a 50/50 ratio is too high.  Testing should be faster to allow devs to be more productive.<p>3. Performance is easy to screw up<p>Reading some of the other comments I realized another minor issue.  Performance in angular is great. However, because angular doesn&#x27;t have any real organized (or patterned) way to create an app (you can make a controller or have a controller in a directive), you end in a situation where the way you have organized your code now creates performance problems.  This is true in any framework and with some training can be avoided. However, it appears that the critical mass for this issue comes much sooner than expected due to the perl-like anything goes feel to application structure.",1428288609

I get the sense that for millennials and younger music is just another kind of light entertainment, take it or leave it. Music for many gen-Xers including myself was practically religion.

9326213,comment,9325687,9325687,0,0,ChristopherM,,,"I have always billed hourly, daily or weekly.  I would never offer a &quot;project&quot; price.  The client never really knows what they want, they just think they do.  In order to properly estimate a project you have to know everything that needs to be done, then you have to draw up an iron-clad contract that prevents the client from claiming something new was, or should have been included in the price.  It also gives the client no incentive to be economical with your time.  By billing hourly their incentives are aligned with yours, they will want to waste the least amount of time possible in order to keep their billable hours down, they will drop features they really don&#x27;t need, they will be unable to deny payment claiming the project wasn&#x27;t completed.  After all they are paying for your time, not for the result.  The caveat of course is that you really have to deliver, and as you do they forget about the hourly billing.  As long as they have problems and you keep solving them, they will just focus on getting their pain points taken care of.<p>Something else to consider, if you want to make real money you are a &quot;consultant&quot; not a freelancer and certainly not a contractor.

For 5 years I could not pick up a single side gig because the potential client would always offer me a job, but refuse to offer me the gig they claimed I was coming in for.  I would always explain to them that I needed to make &quot;real&quot; money, trading one low paying salaried job for another slightly higher paying salaried job did not help me one bit.  I needed the ability to make 2-3 times what the typical senior software engineer makes.  They would get offended, I would leave.

The author talks about performance, but never addresses the fact that most juniors probably started in Python or Ruby. They didn&#x27;t have to care about doing things the most efficient way, and could probably just use a framework to do what they wanted to do without caring about implementation. This lack of concern is not rectified by any of the senior engineers, and only appears once they are required to do something outside of a framework that provides decent performance.<p>I don&#x27;t want to come across as rude, but it seems strange that hiring a junior developer and introducing them to web development doesn&#x27;t come with a guide on what to do or how to approach js. I don&#x27;t quite understand how researching deep enough into Angular to find out about performance tweaks doesn&#x27;t lead one to make a guide or tips for new hires. Sure, you can hope that they know what they are doing, but if you care enough to stop using a framework due to their bad habits it might be time to reflect and realize that the power given by a framework comes with more abilities and more pitfalls.<p>This trade off is clearly demonstrated when the author talks about the &quot;pit[s]&quot; that junior engineers fall into. They look at code and see it works for one use and just use it in the other case because they have seen it work. It isn&#x27;t all their fault that they are &quot;very good at copy and pasting&quot; because nobody has told them the steps to guide their code structure.
