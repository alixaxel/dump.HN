The fact that X86/64 runs on a bunch of electrical fluctuations is actually inconsequential and an implementation detail.<p>Any x86/64 processor built of transistors naturally needs to take into account the behavior of the transistors it&#x27;s made up of. But once you&#x27;ve gone above the micro-code/processor level, those details are fully abstracted.<p>Regardless what programming language you use, that is abstracted away identically and matters not.<p>However, the fact that registers in the process and memory locations exist and mutate is not something abstracted away from every language. It&#x27;s abstracted in some, but not others, so it&#x27;s valid to say that this difference is within the scope of the programming language.<p>That is why the argument differs.

We were just letting people choose their own passwords before, which I don&#x27;t think is a good idea. I really like it. My only annoyance, which isn&#x27;t really the fault of Diceware, is that for lots of passwords I am required to have a capital letter, a digit and/or a special character. Obviously this is to try and increase the entropy in the password, but I know that I have enough entropy in my diceware password and I just want something easy to type.<p>I also discovered the password strength estimator zxcvbn at about the same time. It&#x27;s pretty clever. It works out which password generation schemes could be used to generate your password and then uses that information to calculate the entropy correctly (assuming the attacker would know what scheme you used).",1428306413
