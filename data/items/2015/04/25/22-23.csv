9439824,comment,9439286,9439286,0,0,harmmonica,,,"After spending a couple of years traveling on and off after quitting a job, there are a few things I wish I&#x27;d known/asked myself beforehand.<p>1. In your daily life, are you typically happy/comfortable not having a schedule? You might say &quot;I&#x27;m traveling to get away from daily life,&quot; but longer-term travel is not like taking a vacation. It&#x27;s much more like daily living. If you&#x27;re happy not having a schedule in your normal life, don&#x27;t plan much when you travel. I didn&#x27;t even ask that question before I went traveling, but by nature I have a hard time not having a plan so I planned the s<i></i>* out of my travels (I picked destinations around the planet, bought plane tickets to a chunk of the first destinations, planned activities/goals along the way and even had future destinations in mind (zoom out on Google Maps and just dream/lust after places! You&#x27;ll almost immediately have a plan even if you don&#x27;t like planning!). Anyway, I&#x27;m super stoked I planned the trip. I would&#x27;ve been a bit bummed if I hadn&#x27;t, but as some posters here have said, planning isn&#x27;t for everyone and you have to know what you like. And of course you can have a bit of both.  Doesn&#x27;t need to be &quot;no plan&quot; vs &quot;plan every day,&quot; but structure, if you enjoy structure, is key. If you are too structured and are traveling to change yourself, of course ignore this advice.<p>2. Do you feel a need to accomplish things? I&#x27;m just going to go out on a limb since you&#x27;re asking this on HN that you like &quot;getting stuff done.&quot; You might be an &quot;enjoy the journey more than the destination&quot; person, but a big part of the journey is progressing/growing and so, again, related to schedule, plan on actually accomplishing some things while traveling.  My partner and I, though not particularly outdoorsy, took advantage of several months of traveling to do some short, but serious (for us) hiking and I have to say that absent those events during our travels we wouldn&#x27;t have enjoyed it nearly as much. It&#x27;s awesome seeing the world, and talking to the people who inhabit it, but the desire for accomplishment doesn&#x27;t go away when you do longer-term travel. Like I said, it&#x27;s not like a vacation (though of course we were happy to find ourselves on nice beaches after pushing ourselves to reach &quot;the top of the mountain.&quot; And your mountain can be hiking, learning a language, building an app, volunteering, etc. We just happened to want to see some epic nature)<p>3. Does my partner &quot;love&quot; me enough to not kill me if we&#x27;re on top of each other for months on end (and vice versa)? You can only ask this, of course, if you&#x27;re planning on traveling with a partner. You can always take breaks from each other, which is likely easier if you&#x27;re traveling with a friend instead of a romantic partner, but I think saying upfront what you&#x27;re both comfortable with is important<p>Apologies for the long post. Not sure if you, the OP, will read it, but if you want a spreadsheet with an around-the-world budget, hit me up and I&#x27;ll share a Google one with you. I think I still have it. The single longest trip we did during the 2 years was three months (far shorter than a bunch of the folks who commented), but I/we stayed almost right on budget the whole time, which is actually much easier than you might think because as long as you have some flexibility timing-wise you can always save money on the big-bucket items (air/travel, lodging, food).<p>Oh, one last comment... If you love travel, and have dreamed of doing it more extensively and think you can pull it off, just do it. The only frustrating thing about traveling (for people who really enjoy it!) is not being able to do more of it.",1430002590

That makes me slightly optimistic.",1430002548
9439821,comment,9437925,9439227,0,0,jules,,,"There are two approaches. One approach starts with the data and asks what algorithms can we find to infer something about the data, and the other approach starts with an algorithm and tries to find a dataset on which the algorithm infers something good. This is even more general than machine learning; in many cases you either have a problem and are searching for a solution, or you have a solution and you are searching for a problem. Often you need a mix of both (a bidirectional search if you will). It looks like this book is a mix of both.<p>In the end though the only thing that matters is whether a particular procedure has predictive value. Even with the most principled Bayesian analysis the model or prior are strictly speaking wrong (usually both), because the real world is complicated, so even there you&#x27;re only left with testing predictive performance in practice. Careful probabilistic modeling is only valuable insofar as it lets us focus our search for inference procedures on those that are more likely to work in practice. A good counterexample is deep learning, which does not (or did not) have a solid probabilistic justification, but works extremely well in practice.",1430002521
9439820,comment,9438811,9439695,0,0,barrkel,,,"One word: overdesigned.<p>One of the reasons I disliked HL2 so much was because my experience of it was so controlled and funneled. I felt like the designers removed my agency, and tried to ensure that there was one right way to solve a problem, to the point of punishing me [1], or worse, main-routing[2] me when I sought an alternative route.<p>[1] One location early on requires you to break into a tunnel to come up behind and flank a guard shooting down at you with a mounted gun behind a screen. The problem is that the fact that a flanking tunnel exists means that the designers had no reason to make him possible to hit; it is actually possible to kill him head on, but it&#x27;s difficult, and you will almost certainly take a lot of damage in the process (the punishment). The tunnel is just too damn convenient though, and breaks the suspension of disbelief; it&#x27;s too obviously designed in.<p>[2] I invented the word main-routing to describe a situation where, when you&#x27;re exploring shady nooks that you spot out of the corner of your eye, they look like they go somewhere interesting, so you go back to the main route to find out what the main stream does. But instead it dead-ends, and in fact that shady little corner you were exploring was the only way forward; what you thought was a secret shortcut was just the main route again, in a different guise. This is a double-whammy: not only does it break suspension of disbelief again, but it also punishes exploration. It teaches you that nooks are either dead ends that are pointless to explore, or that the main route will dead-end itself and you&#x27;ll be forced to explore the nook. Either way, you have no choice in the matter, so you&#x27;re better off sticking to the main route until it forces you to explore.<p>I really did not enjoy HL2. It was a cripplingly disappointing experience, especially after having played Deus Ex, which greatly increased my expectations from a game. Going back to playing a mute scientist with an alleged PhD yet whose only mechanism of interacting with the world is violence was like going back to the 90s.",1430002453

In my experience it seems a bit too narrow to generalize across companies but I know a lot of folks who have had some bad experiences at companies and then have extrapolated that to an entire industry. It has been interesting meeting folks at IBM who have 20+ years at the same company. Atypical of Silicon valley folks but not unheard of[1].

And while that can work it sets a tone for your relationship with the people in the company that does not work to your advantage, and can sometimes be a handicap down the road as you re-encounter people with whom you have previously worked.<p>Companies are communities of people. Communities have norms and values and expectations. It is always uncomfortable when you don&#x27;t fit in with the community, and some people are better at &quot;finding their people&quot; than others are.

TLDR: it worked, one did, and I had an awesome four-month trip in the process.<p>I subletted my room in NYC for a bit more than I paid, bought a plane ticket to Goa, and started there. It was the right decision insofar as it&#x27;s a very soft landing in India, which can be a fairly difficult place for a lot of people. After two weeks and some research. I moved on and spent time in a bunch of different cities in India and Nepal; most days I would simply sit and write code in whatever hostel or home stay I was at, eat cheap street food for lunch, and generally be really, really productive. When I felt like it, I&#x27;d go take a walk or see something cool in the area or take a couple days and go on a short vacation somewhere else (e.g. I would never have wanted to spend much time in Agra, but it&#x27;s a short overnight trip from Jaipur to go catch the taj mahal at dawn and then explore agra fort and take a walk before getting on a bus back).<p>It&#x27;s actually the perfect vacation -- traveling can be really stressful, always trying to get to the next place, cram in all the stuff you have to see, etc. You wind up doing crazy things like exhausting yourself taking overnight buses to save time and hostel costs. But I spaced out what could have been a 3-4 week trip across four months, and it was relaxing, productive, interesting, and fun. I got pretty well into each of my projects (all of which involved acquiring new skill sets), figured out the one that had legs and was right for me, and turned it into my next startup.<p>The toughest part was in Kathmandu, where at the time power cuts were 14 hours a day, and of the 10 hours with power, they were mostly at night. But it was actually nice -- I got up early every morning with a charged laptop, worked until the thing was nearly dead after the power had gone out, went to a rooftop cafe to read for a while, went back and worked/charged again for a while, went for a long walk, and got back with enough charge left to last until the power came back on.<p>Overall, a pretty great life.",1430000118
