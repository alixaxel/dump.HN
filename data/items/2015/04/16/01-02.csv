After months of prodding from my girlfriend to go vegan, the book &#x27;Abundance&#x27; and the chapter on the water inefficiency of factory farming is what finally turned me.

9385476,comment,9382513,9385381,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"No, my point is that &quot;hard drugs&quot; like heroin are vastly more dangerous because users cannot use properly whilst the drug remains illegal. It&#x27;s a manufacturing and usage problem. Opiates are rather tame as far as side effects go, and avoiding overdoses isn&#x27;t terrifically hard <i>if you have the right stuff</i>. Users don&#x27;t want to waste precious medicine, nor die. With precision markings, there&#x27;d be vastly less problems reaching the right level of usage. Instead, users are admonished to &quot;do a test shot&quot; each time, which, through laziness or practical concerns, gets ignored and someone falls out.<p>But let me understand you: Are you saying that if someone is in pain, their respiratory system just ignores opiates and they can take large doses even if they&#x27;re opiate naive? Does this work retroactively, like if you don&#x27;t have Narcan handy can you just snap someone&#x27;s leg to save them? (And then, with a broken bone, they&#x27;d certainly get medicated - double win!)<p>Sarcasm aside, do you have a citation for this claim?  That opiate tolerance doesn&#x27;t matter in face of pain? That there&#x27;s a &quot;fundamental difference&quot; in the effect? I&#x27;m truly interested in hearing about that (feel free to contact me via my profile if this thread is too long).<p>Everything I&#x27;ve read and experienced says otherwise. I&#x27;ve talked with some users that were taking opiates for cancer pain management, or for otherwise long-term pain, and they just as happy to take them as unlicensed users (though perhaps a bit more cautious in admitting so). In personal experience from acute trauma leading to a hospital team applying morphine, I went from screaming in pain to absolute noddy-head bliss. I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s the exact effect people are seeking.",1429149329
