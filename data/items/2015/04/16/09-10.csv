Ansible has a blue million modules, but so many of them are incomplete or downright useless. The <i>cron</i> module can handle cron.d files, but it still tries to manage individual lines in the file and tracks state with comments. It can easily get confused and add multiple entries for the same cron job. Puppet had the same problem. The solution is obvious: just make it barf a pre-made file into /etc/cron.d. But why does no CM actually <i>do</i> this?<p>Over the last year I have spent a lot of time using Ansible, and I&#x27;ve eventually given up on the <i>cron</i>, <i>sysctl</i>, <i>service</i> and <i>get_url</i> modules and resorted to running commands or copying files. This isn&#x27;t very clean and it can be brittle, but the alternative of fixing the modules is off the table. The debugging or logging support in most modules is literally non-existent.<p>There also seems to be a pretty serious scaling issue with the way Ansible processes its inventory, even when using the (absolutely essential) _meta optimization that provides the entire inventory in one command. This is at only a few hundred hosts and tens of thousands of variables.<p>Contrast this with Puppet: while there are a great many things I hate about it, the dependency system and ability to define your own types inside of the DSL was pretty powerful. Too bad that you eventually had to get down to writing Ruby modules to do certain things. Also too bad that they built it as a client-server system, allow you to export resources between hosts, and took forever to make the execution order deterministic.<p>The final nail in the coffin for CMs and me is that Ansible (along with Chef, Puppet, Salt) try to do so much but have no concept of absolute state enforcement. The host should always either be in state A or B; the CM system should be able to move in either direction between A and B; and it should never be left in a state inbetween A and B. With Ansible it&#x27;s quite possible to get permanently locked into a middle state, since it may die before handlers are run (which are then never triggered in subsequent runs).<p>Building these tools is admittedly harder than it looks, but the fundamental building blocks of a CM system aren&#x27;t that tough. So many recipes boil down to literally a three step process: install package, copy config file (templating is super nice), start service. Stop trying to play nice with local modifications, the whole point is that I want you to enforce state absolutely -- local modifications are the enemy!<p>I wish there was a CM that focused on getting this stuff absolutely right and then made it easy to build on top of that.",1429177010

If it does work, it also acts as a brake on iterative improvement because your system already works, why risk failure by trying to make it more optimal? Also if you have a proven system, people start making bigger and bigger bets on it&#x27;s success (more expensive payloads, for example), so the cost of any failure goes up.<p>If you aim for optimal design form the start, you&#x27;re almost bound to experience failures. That&#x27;s because say there are 100 parameters you need to tone and you aim for the estimated optimum for all of them. Statistically, half of those estimates are goign to turn out to be sub-optimal. As you iterate on the design, you fix those untill you end up with a truly optimal design. At each iteration, you have a positive incentive to make the necessary changes.<p>Depending on the cost of failure, this can be more expensive than aiming for a conservative, over-engineered design to start with, but not necessarily. Over-engineered systems, for a high chance of initial success, are by definition more costly than optimised designs and there&#x27;s still a non-zero chance of initial failures anyway.",1429176203

While it&#x27;s not a NeXT company product, it was a third-party product for their OS. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s more likely they borrowed ideas from it, if anything. But given they had Sherlock (where the initial version predates OS X), I&#x27;d say it was initially more of a re-imagining of Sherlock.",1429175054

The quality of the community cookbooks varies wildly from &quot;pretty good&quot; to &quot;toxic waste,&quot; and the likelihood of getting fixes upstream fast enough to reflect back into one&#x27;s own environment is generally low, even for good maintainers.<p>And Chef&#x27;s strict adherence to X.Y.Z semver for cookbooks (even though cookbooks don&#x27;t fit semver well) and inability to declare &quot;my cookbook foo_prime can be used whenever cookbook foo is called&quot; makes it near impossible to maintain your own branch while you wait for your fixes to make it \nupstream.<p>This makes it difficult to try to get things done when you encounter a cookbook that just doesn&#x27;t work quite right.
