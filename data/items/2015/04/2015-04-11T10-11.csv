9359070,comment,9354922,9354922,0,0,bayesianhorse,,,"Stop all restrictions on immigration in the developed world! Not out of kindness, or even basic human decency, but because these restrictions don&#x27;t work any more.<p>Look at the US: 18 billion dollars are spent each year for enforcing immigration laws. The result? anywhere between 7 and 30 Million illegal immigrants, which are essential to the country&#x27;s economy, but unable to work, seek the best medical attention or raise their socioeconomic status.<p>In Germany, we have a new kind of &quot;dynamic&quot;. Our constitution grants a right to asylum. Because of that right, every application has to be reviewed, even though two thirds of them are rejected. The first problem is that the bureaucracy is completely overwhelmed by the applications. Second problem is that even the rejected Applicants can&#x27;t be deported, for sheer impracticality of scaling the &quot;deportation&quot; machinery by several magnitudes.<p>Of course, this state of affairs has drawn the attention of even more people smugglers and potential immigrants, raising the burden on our immigration enforcement. It didn&#x27;t have to be Germany, who was stuck in that cycle first. It could have been France. Italy and Greece aren&#x27;t stuck because they essentially tell the immigrants to go to Germany or risk being mistreated.<p>In Germany, these asylum seekers are not allowed to work ever. Which means they have to be paid some form of social support. In my belief, paying social support is cheaper than dealing with the consequences of about a million human beings prohibited from earning a living in a legal way. But even cheaper would be to allow them to work, like they actually want to do.<p>But alas, the majority of citizens in the developed countries have fear of immigrants, so they will have to learn what I just described the hard way.",1428749564

The Parallel Old Gen collector is more efficient in that regard (i.e. provides more compute-throughput) than CMS, Zing or G1, but it is not concurrent and thus you have longer STW pauses compare to the latter collectors.<p>The concurrent collectors trade some throughput for latency by occupying additional threads for concurrent work. Due to the additional synchronization actions (more atomic instructions, read/write barriers, additional cleanups during shorter STW pauses) they are less efficient in overall CPU cycles spent.<p>So it certainly is a tradeoff.<p>Of course a collector that can burn more memory bandwidth and CPU cycles will generally lead to lower pause times, so in that sense increasing throughput of the collector is good for latency.

9359012,comment,9358256,9358256,0,0,kriro,,,"I have worked with Prolog a bit so FOL is somewhat familiar (I wouldn&#x27;t call myself an expert by any means). FOL is quite an amazing tool to reduce the problem space in well defined environments. I enjoy board games and rules based FOL AIs are pretty well suited in that domain. Modelling non-trivial domains as a set of rules is pretty tough though (+Gödel applies). Creating game like structures for everyday stuff is one of my remaining AI research interests (the idea being that expert knowledge can somehow be modelled as AIs that compete in the game and thus be made comparable).
The &quot;Inductive Logic Programming&quot; chapter in &quot;Prolog Programming for AI&quot; (best intro Prolog book imo) is very interesting and has lead to a couple of entries in my todo list :)
Non-Standard logics are also very fascinating.<p>I love &quot;AI A Modern Approach&quot; but the chapter on PGMs wasn&#x27;t the best in my opinion.
