It is a work in progress and currently in an alpha stage. Try it out here: http://richbuild.com<p>&quot;We/I&quot; in the following description refer to the two-person team.<p>In short:<p>*	This is going to be a commercial project<p>*	We want to get some general feedback from you<p>Rich Builder editor goals:<p>*	Build content fast & efficiently<p>*	WYSIWYG, live and uninterrupted editing<p>*	Rich & customizable widget base - focus on content creation with variety beyond linear text & images<p>A few highlights:<p>*	It&#x27;s platform agnostic. Initially it will plug in to WordPress, Drupal & Joomla, custom frameworks later on, too<p>*	It can be used as is as a full featured content editor out of the box on top of your website,<p>*	but you can build a website/theme around it from scratch as well.<p>*	It is highly customizable. You can plug in your own widgets, styles, UI effects and more.<p>*	Each widget is customizable to some extent but with an aim of not overdoing things and keeping it simple<p>*	Think of it as more than <i>rich text</i> editor but less than <i>photoshop</i><p>In general we&#x27;d like you to take a look at it and send usage feedback our way. What you like/dislike the most in particular. Some notes:<p>*	In the current preview some widget options are a bit clunky to use. They may feel cluttered and non-specialized.  We&#x27;re working on providing option-unique interfaces for some of them and cleaning things up already.<p>*	Widget base is simple right now, blueprint-ish even, we will be gradually extending it to eventually include widgets such as sliders, external feeds (twitter, flickr etc) and more.<p>*	We are aware that there are other tools similar to this one out there already on the market. Our is a bit different, not better (neither now nor never perhaps) but different.<p>Other than that we will appreciate your insight regarding anything. Thanks!",1430099884

It&#x27;s quite common for people to use a different spelling in their &quot;English&quot; professional life. Sometimes this is å->aa, other times it is even just å->a.

It probably seems that way because you&#x27;re missing the subtext of this advice.<p>At worst HR/Legal will recommend that you get fired, at best you aren&#x27;t on their radar. There is a very low chance that HR will go against your manager and fight for you. They just aren&#x27;t incentivized that way: their job is to protect the company, not ensure fairness. HR people are awarded for cleaning up messes, not for interfering with the management structure. They risk more downside to support a single employee. In general HR departments are in a position of weakness when compared to management in companies.<p>His priority is to stay at the company, not make a change. The best way to maximize his chances of staying at the company is to not make a ruckus and do what his manager says. If he wanted to maximize his chances of making a change, however, the best way would be to go to his manager&#x27;s manager. His manager&#x27;s manager is actually incentivized to ensure his reports are doing good/non-illegal work. His chances of getting firing go up by taking that route, but in the slim chance his manager&#x27;s manager has detected these sorts of problems in the past and is currently waiting for the straw that broke the camel&#x27;s back then he might be successful.<p>I&#x27;m not advocating not making a change in the company, I&#x27;m just being logical w.r.t. to keeping his job right now. The spirit of my advice is &quot;die another day.&quot; Right now he has very little influence to actually make change. Better to advance those goals once he&#x27;s in a more stable position in the company. For him, the stakes are too high to risk martyrdom.",1430096688

But just because there is variation doesn&#x27;t mean that the generalization is wrong. Generalizations are just that: statements about a larger phenomenon that necessarily ignores internal variation.<p>I don&#x27;t think Sal Khan ever insinuated that there has never been a single non-factory model educational system in the West in the last ~150 years. If that&#x27;s the proposition you&#x27;re trying to refute, you&#x27;re arguing against a straw man.<p>What I think Sal Khan was getting at -- and what I think the other authors mentioned in the article are trying to say -- is that the general social milieu from which the modern educational system arose was biased toward excessive standardization, categorization, and homogenization. After all, that was the world view of industrial modernism. Standardize everything, bin things into neat categories, and throw away products that don&#x27;t meet the spec.<p>When you&#x27;ve got an entire generation obsessed with that modernist hammer, everything looks like a nail, including education. No wonder modern schools (and prisons, as another commenter mentioned) ended up with uncanny similarities to modern factories. It needn&#x27;t have been intended. It needn&#x27;t have been a conspiracy. It needn&#x27;t have been imposed from the top down. It could have just emerged spontaneously all over the place. That&#x27;s how trends and world views work.<p>Nowadays, commerce is king. Everyone is obsessed with ROI, everyone wants to hire an MBA, everything is explained in terms of supply and demand, and every relationship looks like that between a buyer and seller. Just like the industrial mindset gave birth to last century&#x27;s schools, this new mindset is shaping today&#x27;s schools. Schools, and universities in particular, are becoming more and more like a business. Students and parents are being treated as customers, and are being ripped off just like Comcast customers. But the commercial mindset hasn&#x27;t replaced the industrial mindset; both are alive and well, interacting with each other in very dangerous ways.<p>Just because there are exceptions doesn&#x27;t mean that this general trend doesn&#x27;t exist. In fact, it would be very strange if a society&#x27;s mindset didn&#x27;t influence the design of its educational institutions.
