Lets say I don&#x27;t like exceptions, and that I don&#x27;t mind implementing library code on my own, would turning GC off impact anything else?<p>You can turn off the GC in the sense that memory allocation will always request more memory from the OS instead of occasionally starting a collect cycle. However, you can alternatively use manual memory management (malloc/free, allocators/RAII on top of that, etc.), which will never trigger the GC.<p>> How is the story for deploying executables to mac/win/lin?

Raise and slaughter animals in the most humane and painless way without regard for economic cost. (omnivore&#x27;s dilemma way)\n3. Do not raise any animals. Eat a 100% plan based diet. (vegan way).<p>There is no scenario where animals can trade enduring pain for anything. We are talking about domestic animals. They are born because we facilitated it, with the expectation of a gain from such activity.<p>I can see why people would want to be vegan, and while I do not share those opinions I respect them. But, if everybody thought like that, most domestic animal species would go extinct in a few decades. Most people would stop raising them, and if a few misguided folks would release flocks in the wild, those are in general not prepared to occupy an ecologic niche. They will either die off or wreck the environment of the region they were released at.<p>So, between options 1 and 2. The animals are going to die anyways, because if we did not expected to eat them, nobody would have bothered raising them. The only question left is how much suffering are they to endure in the process of dying. Proponents of #1 say this does not matter as long as the plate is full. Proponents of #2 say it is morally right to eat less meat in order to ensure the animals get killed in a more humane way.<p>How does your previous comment fits in that debate?",1430105362

We just make everything more competitive, more stressful, less... human.<p>But Capitalism also allows people a great degree more freedom to do the things they want.  Are there constraints?  Sure.  Is it perfect?  Clearly not.  But there are many who justify themselves by the works they produce.  I don&#x27;t ordinarily think of myself as that, but when I was an electrician, I used to construct things, build things.<p>I still get a sense of pride whenever I&#x27;m home and can look at the light poles that I jackhammered the foundations from, directed the concrete pouring of, wired to main, erected with a crane and bolted into place.  There&#x27;s an odd sense of pride that I have every time I see them.  That&#x27;s something I did.  And yeah, it&#x27;s pretty trivial, but I get value from it.<p>In a capitalist system, not only can I prioritize how much I choose to work, but I also have the luxury of choosing what I do, where I can contribute the most value.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve studied it very much, but compared to assigned work for whatever the normal amount of pay is, I very much prefer the freedom of working more for more money, or working less for less money, in a field of my choosing.<p>I can then allocate that money to the items I prioritize most dearly to me.  I never have as new a phone as my peers seem to, but in their stead, I have some very nice guitars that I gain great enjoyment from.<p>I&#x27;m not yet convinced that there a non-capitalist system exists that affords me such choices.  Without incentivizing at least some people to go out and get work done, it seems unlikely to me that there is wealth enough to sustain our collective frivolities.  And sure, looking out the window doesn&#x27;t cost a whole lot, but guitars do, and so do canvases and paints.",1430103751

I haven&#x27;t read a technical book in several years, because it&#x27;s so much easier to find what I want online. But I read nonfiction whenever I have the time, or want to decompress. I have no problem switching between hyper-multitasking and deep focus.<p>Perhaps the author never fully learned that. I wonder if it&#x27;s age-related. Or maybe I&#x27;m the odd one: ADHD/bipolar with hard-won focusing skills ;)",1430103719
