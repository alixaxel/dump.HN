It&#x27;s pretty interesting.<p>To be honest, I only read it because one of the authors is Nassim Taleb and I liked his books.<p>Anyway, the gist of it is that there are different kinds of risk. Some risks can be calculated with certain probabilities, and you can do cost-benefit analysis with them.<p>For example, you should only spend money on a security system for your home or business if the cost-of-being-attacked times the probability of attack exceeds the cost of the system, right?<p>However, there is another kind of risk for which you can&#x27;t do that, because their cost is so high that nobody will live to tell the tale and collect the statistics (extinction events), or maybe they will but it will be too late (global financial crisis).<p>The paper argues that monocultures present that kind of risk. You can&#x27;t calculate &quot;probability of massive blight that kills all our genetically homogeneous food&quot; for example because we don&#x27;t have much of a sample size. And by the time we do have the sample size, it will be too late.<p>Then, the paper points out some other risks and explains why the risks of artificial selection are different from the risks of GMO. Long story short, it&#x27;s because a bad mutation in a &quot;natural&quot; crop only kills a few people before they realize that they should plant something else.",1430268691

A large percentage of their customers are probably just average &quot;webmasters&quot; who are using CloudFlare to improve security and page load times for their WordPress sites and whatnot. They&#x27;re comfortable with clicking around the website to get the result they want, but if you just gave them an API and some npm packages to access it, it would take them several hours to get the same thing done. They might do better the next time, but if that initial friction hurts CloudFlare&#x27;s conversion rate, why bother?<p>We&#x27;ve been seeing the same problem for several years already with *nix desktop environments and applications. Some rockstar programmers and designers collectively decided that they&#x27;ll optimize the graphical UI for newbies and hide all advanced features in a bunch of manually editable config files, command-line flags, or (heaven forbid) the source code itself. Result: newbies are happy because the UI is simple and streamlined. Advanced users are happy because they can still do what they want to do. But a lot of semi-advanced, I&#x27;m-still-learning users in the middle of the bell curve are pissed off because they see no reason why they shouldn&#x27;t be able to use a mouse to get work done. And since we&#x27;re talking about a bell curve, that&#x27;s a lot of pissed-off users.<p>Many people here on HN have warm fuzzy feelings toward the concept of mashing keyboards all day long.

We are expected to formulate standards for grading, inform the students of these standards, and follow them when assigning grades.<p>A relatively standard term for grading in ways that does not follow announced standards is &quot;capricious grading&quot;. And many -- perhaps most, perhaps all -- U.S. universities now have official policies against it. Egregious violations of such policies would be grounds for various kinds of penalities/punishment.<p>That is not to say that cheating is irrelevant. For example, every syllabus I write contains the line, &quot;Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated, and will be dealt with according to [my school&#x27;s] procedures.&quot;<p>In another comment, user hn_ says, &quot;A syllabus is <i>not</i> a contract.&quot; This is correct. That means that a syllabus is not enforceable in a court of law. However, <i>university policy</i> may still dictate that a syllabus is an ironclad statement of how the course will be conducted.<p>So, for example, I have seen a student make a complaint against a professor and take it up the chain of command. The first question asked by each of the administrators the complaint came to was, &quot;What does the syllabus say?&quot; If the professor is found to be acting in accordance with the course syllabus, then the student has a much harder time making a case -- at the very least.<p>A related issue, which seems to be an important one in the case mentioned in the article, is that grading standards are generally to be applied individually. There is such a thing as group work, of course; in such cases we make it clear that each person in the group is judged by the performance of the group as a whole.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know how accurately this article is representing the actual events that occurred. But if Horwitz really is assigning individual grades based on a nebulous judgement about the class as a whole, then I would say he is clearly guilty of a violation of professional ethics. What &quot;the class deserves&quot; is simply irrelevant to an individual&#x27;s grade.",1430268395

Example:<p><pre><code>    type Adder interface {
      Add()

    type VectorAdder interface {

For a while my internalized borrow checker would throw red flags on me tossing around data indiscriminately, but I learned to ignore it as far as Go code goes. I was able to quickly share state via pointers without worrying about safety, which was quite useful.</i><p>I haven&#x27;t gotten very far into the article yet, but this paragraph sent up a huge red flag for me. GC does not make the code safe. All it does is ensure that values don&#x27;t get destroyed while they&#x27;re still referenced. But you still run the risk of data races. If you&#x27;re writing single-threaded code then this is fine (because single-threaded code doesn&#x27;t have data-races), but the program being written here is a concurrent program.<p>Obviously you can write safe programs in this fashion. But you still have to think about safety. The difference is the compiler doesn&#x27;t verify safety for you, which means you can write code fast without worrying about the compiler yelling at you, but your program may have race conditions in it.<p>Anecdotally, a few years ago when I was active with Go, a program of mine would segfault about once a <i>month</i>. It was a command-line utility that I ran maybe a few times a day. The segfault was so sporadic that I could never figure out what was going on. Then Go 1.1 introduced the data race detector. Using that, I was able to discover that the Go runtime was actually spinning up two goroutines when I thought it was only using one (servicing the stdout and stderr of a child process), and the one buffer object I was writing to turned out to be written to from two separate threads. This usually worked, but on that rare occasion it would lose the race and overrun the buffer. This is a bug that plagued me for half a year, and I&#x27;m really glad that the Go team created that data race detector because I never would have figured out what was going on without it.

9455876,comment,9453381,9453381,0,0,Animats,,,"Having written in both Rust and Go, I found that a very good article.<p>The big new idea in Rust, of course, is the ownership model and its compile time borrow checker. That&#x27;s worked out surprisingly well.  I expect to see that idea appear in future languages.  One could have a Go-like or Python-like language with a borrow checker.  It&#x27;s not inherently tied to Rust.<p>As a practical matter, programming in Rust is more likely to hit problems with type checking than borrow checking.  Ownership problems are usually with your own code. Type problems often involve code written by others, and changes to other modules often induce type errors.  Because Rust has type inference, and because it&#x27;s often not obvious what the type inference engine is doing, Rust can have rather abstruse type problems.  Go is rather straightforward in that area.<p>Go lacks generics and templates. This simplifies the language, but the lack of generics then has to be worked around. Go has too much use of &quot;interface{}&quot;. Bolt-on compiler passes such as &quot;go generate&quot; and the protocol buffer compiler have been added. Both are used mostly to get around the lack of generics.  Rust has very powerful generics and templates, so powerful that they tend to be over-used. Everything seems to need a generic. Rust is starting at the cruft level it took C++ 20 years to reach.  This may or may not work out in practice.  It may be necessary to restrain Rust template enthusiasts from getting carried away.<p>Error handling in both languages is via return values.  Go is straightforward, with multiple return values being the normal approach. The Rust mechanism, involving Result<> and Some<> types, is rather clever, but results in wordy code to do simple things.  Too much Rust code goes into putting things into Result and Some objects, then analyzing and dismantling those objects.  It&#x27;s not clear that leaving exceptions out of Rust is a win.  Negative experience with C++ exceptions may have motivated that design decision.<p>Rust has Resource Allocation Is Initialization (RAII).  Go does not.  For both languages, problems come up with resource release.  Go has &quot;defer()&quot;, which is kind of clunky and can&#x27;t be encapsulated, while Rust has destructors called when something is deallocated.  In both cases, it&#x27;s hard to handle an error at resource release time.  Destructors that do anything non-trivial are usually troublesome.  Both languages have this problem.  Languages with &quot;with&quot; (Common LISP&#x27;s &quot;(with-open-file ... ...)&quot; and Python&#x27;s &quot;with FILEOBJ as HANDLE : &quot; have fewer headaches with resource release errors, since they occur in ordinary code, not at some special destructor time.",1430266671
