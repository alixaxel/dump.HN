I can&#x27;t speak for the OP, but I can say that I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s sometimes easier to explain <i>sensitivities</i> as <i>allergies</i> to people who don&#x27;t understand the differences. So, giving that poster the benefit of the doubt, I&#x27;ll assume they either don&#x27;t know the difference themselves, or they DO know but don&#x27;t want to split hairs on the matter in case someone doesn&#x27;t know.<p>As a personal anecdote along these lines and since discovering my own sensitivities to canola (and rapeseed oils in general), I&#x27;ve learned that simply calling it a &quot;sensitivity&quot; doesn&#x27;t always convey the need to avoid certain ingredients. So, sometimes I tell people instead to &quot;think of it as a food allergy,&quot; which they usually understand.<p>I think that at least part of the problem is that, to a layperson, <i>sensitivity</i> doesn&#x27;t sound as urgent or at least is suggestive of &quot;optional avoidance.&quot; For some people, chemical sensitivities are anything <i>but</i> optional avoidance...",1429156725

The incumbents have such sky-high development costs that reusability seemed like an impossible task to do economically. Last time anyone tried they came up with STS, which was highly capable but ultimately dangerous and ruinously expensive.

I know your pain, as I recently went through the subscription hell (confirm emails, error checking, change credit card, valid_until, webooks, accounting stats, etc), but this is the core of your company and it needs to be right. Stripe was actually the easy part, it is all the scaffolding around it to make subscriptions work, which is extremely painful. If this out-sourced saas goes out of business tomorrow, you are royally screwed, has a security issue, screwed, hardware failure with data loss, screwed, bad service, customers are screwed, you are screwed, etc, etc. There needs to be a better way I know, I&#x27;m just not sure this is the answer, and it is just way to risky.<p>Having said all that, I think <a href=""https://www.ccbill.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ccbill.com/</a> does something close to what you are looking for.",1429155410

In this case, it&#x27;s not the suspect that made that choice to prevent law enforcement from gaining access.<p>> Encryption on devices with the relevant hardware instructions is basically free; the user receives no practical benefit from not using it. What purpose is there in presenting the user with a choice that every rational user will make the same way?<p>It&#x27;s not free - encrypting data always comes with the risk that you&#x27;re going to lose the means to decrypt it.  I can think of two people I know who in one case put full disk encryption on their cell phone and in the other case put full disk encryption on their laptop.  After rebooting a week or two, both had forgotten the passwords they used and lost all of the data on them.  Neither of them encrypt their devices anymore.<p>Encryption can make data recovery a pain in the butt.  I&#x27;ve had encrypted e-mails in my mail archives that I&#x27;ve discovered that I no longer have the private key for - it got replaced a year prior, the new key got migrated to a new computer without the old one, and the old computer eventually got wiped and repurposed.<p>Yeah, it was my mistake for not backing up my old GPG key.  I&#x27;d put a hefty share of the blame on my two friends as well for their encryption woes as well.  But that&#x27;s the point - we make mistakes, and strong encryption isn&#x27;t very forgiving.  It&#x27;s a trade-off that not everyone is going to make, especially for data they don&#x27;t consider sensitive; I&#x27;ve lived with people who have to go through password recovery every two weeks or so.  Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t encrypt something that I&#x27;m only going to access once every 5 years or so; I&#x27;d use some other solution like making an unencrypted backup on some removable media and storing it in a secure place.",1429154447

The list goes on, pretty much everything is expensive over here, even digital products with zero shipping or handling costs are triple or more the price in the US. For example I pay $70/month for 200GB of &#x27;broadband&#x27; that peaks at 500kb/s and is totally incapable of streaming video. My mobile phone costs $95/month and I get 5GB of data.",1429153694

But it&#x27;s not completely fungible by any stretch of the imagination.<p>I don&#x27;t know enough about the water system and the patterns of shortages to understand the prevalence of direct competition between sets of users.  Of course a weird thing is that municipalities may have locked in particular sources, so there may not be anyone in competition with us at all (for example, we in San Francisco have near-exclusive access to Hetch Hetchy, so water demand from farmers elsewhere in the state isn&#x27;t likely to threaten our municipal water supply, at least not very directly).<p>I guess I need to learn more about the extent to which different users actually compete with one another.  Clearly livestock farmers in the Central Valley <i>are</i> in competition with crop farmers there for the same water resources, but their competition with city dwellers for sources of what might have been human drinking water is a thornier question.",1429153631
