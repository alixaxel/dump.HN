The latter absolutely needs javascript (or your application language). If your site is part of the former category though, you should make sure that you keep your focus on the content; all else is secondary.<p>Also, I&#x27;d argue that the application-based web is still a minority compared to the content-based web, and you should check what side your site is really on.",1429880391

Doesn&#x27;t mean the people back then had the same emotions or those were the ones that brought the reform.<p>Reading about the treatment of slaves in the South today will get a huge emotional response too, but that was not how slavery was abolished then -- it took a whole civil war (and decades of struggles with prejudice, Jim Crow laws, KKK and segregation).<p>><i>As for his flatly contradicting himself, opening his own book a practically random page brings up the following quote from a contemporary (Damhoudere) complaining that Foucault&#x27;s executioners exercise &quot;every cruelty with regard to the evil-doing patients, treating them, buffeting and killing them as if they had a beast in their hands.&quot; The fact that executions were public spectacles did not mean that people approached them with expectations of justice.</i><p>Where&#x27;s the contradiction? What some public figures and intellectuals said of the executions is not the same as what the public sentiment about them.<p>To continue with the same exampke, that&#x27;s in the same way that there were several prominents pro-abolitionists in the South, but that was not the prevalent sentiment of the people there.",1429878829

Hardware came first and then at one point early on they have to decide what toolset/frameworks will be used for lowlevel and toplevel applications. But really there is not a lot of choice at all: either do what the others do and develop for Windows and as such assure customers will come in, interoperability with other hardware is easy and so on. Or do &#x27;the right thing&#x27; and go open source which has the benefit of open source but that is about it. Good luck finding customers willing to embrace your product and use it in their production lines if it runs on some, to them, alien platform of which they couldn&#x27;t care less what license it has and if there is no straightforward way to make it work together with the hardware they currently own.

Does this indirectly make a case for paying a vendor real money to manage their product properly? All vendors we work with provide installers that handle installing any dependencies. Updates are a few clicks. Occasionally we run into a vendor who provides installation/upgrade instructions, that involve manually copying files and hand editing config files. We replace those vendors. Error-prone people should not be doing manual file copying/editing or dependency checking, tasks that computers are dozens or orders of magnitude more competent at. This is B2B stuff where businesses should manage their product or risk getting sued out of business. The current environment seems to be that using free or opensource products is &quot;free, with purchase of a team of consultants&quot;. Why not just pay the money to a vendor to provide, and support, a real product? It seems backwards to call this a sad state of sysadmin. This is like Boeing providing its leftover parts and a 9000 page manual on 747 assembly, and people complaining about the &quot;sad state of mechanics&quot;. That&#x27;s backwards.

The reality is that teaching critical thinking doesn&#x27;t scale nicely, because it requires an intimate dialogue; the process of rigorously critiquing ideas is a two-way street. In today&#x27;s institutions, where professors lecture to classes of
200+ students, this simply isn&#x27;t possible.<p>In the article, the author claims universities have abandoned their roles as centres of critical thinking due to capitalistic forces. While I think this is true, I also believe that our collective attitude towards university shares the blame. Unfortunately, college is seen as the only legitimate path to success after high school.<p>If students had more opportunities to explore their interests, instead of being funnelled into university, perhaps universities could re-establish themselves as institutions where critical discussion takes place.",1429877785

    small,

There may be exceptions, but the typical setup is that the central bank prints physical money solely as a reaction to demand by banks (who need it to stock their ATMs). From an asset point of view it is an entirely neutral operation that is irrelevant to the state&#x27;s fiscal position.<p>In some countries (including the US), <i>coins</i> are minted by the treasury and then sold to the central bank for distribution. In those countries, the state does profit from seignorage - but only of coins, so it tends to be irrelevant in practice (modulo the occasional amusing trillion dollar platinum coin debate).",1429877292
