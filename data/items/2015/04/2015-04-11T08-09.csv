Some of them subtly painted, but generally that. In time, I simply stopped attending any. Whenever my employer needs me to learn something new, I end up suggesting buying me two books on the subject and letting me take three days off to study them. Cheaper and far more efficient.<p>I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re covering in the chapter about the Linux foundation, but the second chapter sounds <i>extremely</i> useful to me. A lot of people who come from a Windows or often an OS X background don&#x27;t really grok:<p>* That you can -- and <i>should</i> -- chain program together, not rely on the feature set of a single one<p>* That, when in doubt, you can look at the source of the program if you can read it<p>* That there are other release models at work other than &quot;One major version ever X years and $osnameUpdate in between&quot;, and you need to know what you can expect from each<p>* That the kernel and various bits of userspace are separately developed and packaged, which has repercussions over what practical systems look like.",1428742607
9358915,comment,9355486,9358839,0,0,bachback,,,"I agree that there is a lot drivel, but I&#x27;d extend that to Bitcoin discussions also, where rarely economic underpinnings get discussed.<p>There is this notion of a contract. In a democracy a valid contract is an agreement (say between 2 parties) which is enforceable by courts and executive. Enforceable means that there is a cost of cheating. Even the most simple purchase contains a purchase agreement. If Alice walks into Bob&#x27;s store and takes something without paying, then this is what we call theft (although the precise details of theft can be argued about ad infinitum).<p>In the real world when we enter agreements, we usually know to some extent who we are dealing with (Alice knows Bob&#x27;s store). What would an arbitrary agreement over a network look like? That&#x27;s hard to say. An analogon of a court is some arbitrary human decision, which can serve as an input. In Bitcoin there is no notion of an agreement, only cash transactions (and some limited facilities for escrow).<p>I believe that the concept of an oracle, and several other crypto-terms like Zero-knowledge proofs are an academic dead end. For my purposes I&#x27;m assuming that most people who want to use crypto systems don&#x27;t understand or care about these things. There will be a great need for mapping abstract concepts to useful tools, such as an GUI operating system maps very abstract physical calculations and processes and makes them usable. I suspect 99% of Bitcoin users don&#x27;t understand public-key cryptography, much less Elliptic curves and distributed systems. &quot;Key&quot;, &quot;signature&quot; and &quot;coins&quot; are useful metaphors.<p>What is already happening are the first beginnings of joint stock ownership developing (DAC&#x27;s) with mixtures of online formal agreements and informal agreements. Voting is not a panacea, but it helps. That&#x27;s the kind of contract that can be developed in the short term.",1428742582

It helped me realize that there is no better time for me to launch my startup and that I am more than ready for that.<p>It was my first application and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m ever going to apply to YC or this kind of big incubator again.

They have their own library and macros which do all this stuff, and when they read the question they instantly see which technique they need to use and boom they&#x27;re done. You have to remember that these people have been practising this stuff from a very early age, and that in many cases, spending hours and hours becoming good at this is their only way out of a crappy life (Eastern Europeans). However, being good at competitive programming has very little correlation with being a good software engineer (I think there is some analysis done by the likes of Google or Microsoft which proves this, I will try to find the link later).",1428741387

You could only do deterministic concurrency, which is not what you want in many cases, e.g when you use concurrency to mask latency. For example how would you define a lock or mutex if all races are forbidden? You need race conditions, but you want them in homeopathic doses, you want them constrained and tightly controlled.<p>I also doubt that concurrent programming patterns like <i>dynamic</i> deadlock detection and removal are amenable to a type-theoretic analysis in linear-logic based systems such as Caires & Pfenning&#x27;s.",1428741275

The documentation claims it needs a 10MHz CPU. I tried it on DOSBox and it was able to play through the PC Speaker, but when slowed down to 4.77MHz-equivalent speed it just failed to make any noises at all. If you have a link to another program (or different version of MODEdit) that can play on PC Speaker at 4.77MHz I&#x27;d love to check it out and see their techniques.",1428739469

Don&#x27;t recompile binary whose sources didn&#x27;t change, don&#x27;t copy file which is already there, and so on. Because those operations add up to hours as the project grows.<p>If we didn&#x27;t mind waiting for hours each time we build, then of course, a shell script that does `rm -rf target` then assembles everything from scratch would be significantly more straightforward and readable.",1428739460
