9450701,comment,9448073,9450220,0,0,christianbryant,,,"I&#x27;ll reply to everyone at once here since the same concern for the most part is being conveyed.  1) Regardless your personal definition of &quot;pedophile&quot; or &quot;terrorist&quot; I believe there are crimes that a solid selection of persons across humanity can agree are not acceptable.  But I realize there is no universality of beliefs, so I will be flexible here.  I&#x27;m actually not saying you _should_ cooperate with law enforcement, only that, accepting that the law is _supposed_ to be upholding human decency, then we _ought_ due to moral responsibility help them.  But... 2) if we do that, must we also sacrifice anonymity and the right to privacy?  All the examples below illustrate that what we ought to do can often get us harmed; so the solution?  3) Vigilantism on the part of conscientious Tor operators; that is, boot the offenders, release the data to the public that they are trying to keep private, and let someone else deal with them.  What, you believe that some sacred law among the cyber underground has now been broken?  In prison, they kill pedophiles.  This is not snitching but a combination of self-preservation (getting law enforcement off your scent) and universal justice (because there must be crimes &quot;we&quot; can &quot;all&quot; agree aren&#x27;t conducive to a healthy life, a progressive universe and the continuation of the species as advanced.",1430200753

As wondering if you&#x27;re in a situation where your axioms are inconsistent, well that&#x27;s actually the world mathematics lives in.  Godel&#x27;s Incompleteness Theorems show that, besides some weak axiom systems, the only systems of axioms that can prove they are consistent are the ones that are inconsistent. So we can only tell when systems are inconsistent, never when they are consistent.  You just kinda hope it&#x27;s not all inconsistent.",1430200745

It is such an elegant solution to a common problem (text parsing and productions). It is <i>also</i> a functional language.<p>XSLT is also a functional language. An XSLT processor is expected to implement a standard (as opposed to jq and awk) - but that&#x27;s a minor difference.<p>It is when you are required to blend the disciplines that the limitations sneak up on you. In powershell it works the same regardless of whether I process data from JSON, from XML, from line-oriented text, from CSV, fixed columns or or from database queries. Sorting, grouping, comparing, mapping, presenting, converting - it is  the same skill set.<p>That is not so say that something like PowerShell can or should replace tools like awk, XSLT or jq. It should not. Period.<p>But for tasks where one has to use several formats, the lack of a sufficiently strong inter-command protocol causes the tools to bloat and include functionality that has nothing to do with the core task. Consider, for example, why jq needs a &quot;@csv&quot; function (called a &quot;format string&quot;) - and @html, @sh, @base64!<p>My claim is that those functions have nothing to do with JSON processing.<p>The equivalent in PowerShell is handled by ConvertTo-Csv, ConvertTo-Html, Out-String or the [Convert] class.<p>It really comes down to a n*m problem. jq is just one tool that implements csv or html formatting (m formats). There are n tools (jq, awk, xslt, ...). Should they all use the same rationale as jq and implement csv formatting? Or should they stay away from that and just concentrate on the core task.<p>In PowerShell the equivalent of jq - the ConvertFrom-Json cmdlet - just converts from JSON. Regardless of whether the objects were converted from JSON, line-oriented text, database queries, fixed columns, XML - the output formatting is handled by tools that are optimized for that.<p>If I&#x27;m dissing anything it is the limited inter-command protocol of traditional shells. In this day and age we process complicated structures that are not easily expressed in line-oriented plain text.",1430198623
