The Thais gave it up without a fight. The French colonzied it and never gave it back. When they left it became what is now known as Laos.",1428595162

If it is okay to buy it, it is okay to sell it.  If it is okay to sell it, it is okay to produce it.  If it is okay to produce it, it is okay to acquire the raw materials and precursors (i.e. grow cannabis, grow mycelium, grow ergot, buy pseudoephedrine).<p>If there is a possible malicious use or purpose, you can only criminalize that chain as far back as the last link in an innocent use or purpose.  If you criminalize methamphetamine, you cannot also criminalize pseudoephedrine, because it is still a decongestant cold remedy, which is an innocent purpose.<p>In my view, you cannot separate links from the web of commerce by outlawing an intermediate activity and pretend that the orphaned innocent activities are not affected by it.<p>I think those laws previously mentioned are thus aimed more at influencing policing activity.

9348213,comment,9347089,9347353,0,0,MichaelCrawford,,,"Your reply is precisely why I reposted what at first was a comment.  I am quite devoted to my writing, however I regard as my worst fault that I quite commonly lose my readers.<p>I have done this to you.  What I&#x27;m going to do about it - and this was my plan but I couldn&#x27;t say so within HN&#x27;s 2000 character limit - is to write up a well-researched article that addresses my thesis in far more depth.<p>No, I&#x27;m not saying that anyone will spend more money on advertising.  That&#x27;s part of the problem, you see.  I don&#x27;t know in much detail but I can readily see how there would be a largely fixed proportion of the GDP that goes into ad spend.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is that there is less advertising money to go around, among those who publish ads.  Three ways to address this are for ads to get cheaper - that is, to charge less money per-click or per-impression - or for ads to become &quot;more effective&quot; in the sense that the click rate for the average ad is somehow increased.<p>The third way is for there to be a greater total quantity of ads.<p>Compare the web advertising you see today, as opposed to what you saw when I myself started with adsense in 2004, and compare again to the simple banner ads that were typical when I first used a banner-exchange service back around 1997 or 1998.<p>In 1998, a commercial website could make good money with one single tastefully design IMG link banner ad per page.  That&#x27;s how I flogged my consulting business - I wrote lots of technical articles, each with just one banner ad that linked to my resume, then later to a page that described my business.<p>In 2003, I spent a month quite obsessively researching and writing what turned out to be a hugely popular article on legal music downloading, as well as the history of copyright in the US, as well as how to approach copyright reform.  The real meat of that article for most readers was a whole bunch of laboriously researched links to sites where one could download such music legally - such as my own piano tracks.<p>For the most part, at the time such legal downloads were from indie musicians such as myself, offering their MP3s so as to draw traffic and organic links to their sites.<p>So I wrote that in 2003, then let it sit on autopilot for a solid year before someone suggested I try AdSense.  That&#x27;s why I was able to get three grand that first month.  It averaged $3,500.00 for about three years then slowly declined, eventually it totally tanked I expect as a result of iTunes offering DRM-free music downloads.<p>There is no doubt whatsoever that the success of iTunes is due to my article.  That really is what I was hoping to achieve.  I wasn&#x27;t trying to promote &quot;free music downloads&quot;.  No: I was promoting &quot;legal music downloads&quot;.  That&#x27;s quite a different thing.<p>Were I to write an article like that today - to spend a solid month working 24/7 to research it, emailing hundreds of people with the request that they critique it, then to spend a solid year posting the link all over G-d&#x27;s Creation...<p>... how much do you expect I could earn in adsense?<p>Even were I to publish it ad-free for a year, I expect I&#x27;d get somewhere between ten and a hundred bucks per month.<p>The problem we&#x27;ve got is that advertising does not do anyone any good whatsoever, unless someone spends some real money on something they need or want.  The businesses who sell things that people need or want pay for advertising so they can move their products or services.<p>The growth an ad spend is, over a period of about ninety years, almost but not quite strictly proportional to the GDP, with the constant of proportionality being 0.02.<p>$advertising = 0.02 * $GDP<p>(Roughly)<p>What I&#x27;ve been seeing since the subprime meltdown, is that many people know that lots of money can be made, somehow, in high-tech, yet many of these same people really aren&#x27;t that sophisticated with high tech.  Quite commonly I see - especially at LinkedIn - posts that say things like &quot;Can you suggest any iPhone programming tutorials&quot;.<p>I&#x27;d be down with that if the poster had ever written any software of any significance.  But I see lots of queries like that from people who can&#x27;t even get Hello World to build, let alone run to completion.<p>Also a common problem today is that while we do have job growth, we have terrible underemployment.  Back in the day, few people held part-time jobs.  If you were offered a job at all, you could reasonably expect forty hours.<p>A bookkeeper whose name will never escape my lips once told me that employee benefits must be equally given to all employees, otherwise the benefits will be taxed as salary.<p>This has to do with that, during World War II, the US Government imposed wage caps so as to keep down the cost of war materiel.  The armaments firm needed a competitive advantage to attract new employees, so they started offering health insurance, then somehow managed to keep Uncle Sam from regarding that insurance as hourly pay or salary.<p>However the requirement to pay benefits equally to all, does not apply to part-time workers.  So today we even see experienced managers working part-time.  I find that to be the case in many of the cafes and restaurants I frequent.<p>So you&#x27;re working part-time, you get no benefits, higher education is collassally expensive and would burden you with usurous student loan debts.<p>How could you possibly feed your hungry child?<p>The very-common advice at WebmasterWorld is to do just what I did: write article about what you already know, care about or are at least willing to learn - then publish ads alongside your written content.<p>That worked really well up until the subprime meltdown.<p>But what we see now are vast numbers of people working diligently, feverishly - desperately - to write such content, then publish those ads...<p>... but the total ad spend is still 2% of GDP, despite that the number of webpages is growing far our of proportion either to the overall GDP, or to the net-connected population of the world.<p>Rather than &quot;working smarter, not harder&quot;, these unsophisticated webmasters are working harder, by using canned javascript and the like to post &quot;Like Us On Facebook&quot; the instant I visit an otherwise intriguing article I find on HN, or quite commonly they solicit my email for their newsletter.<p>I am quite commonly cool to subscribe to newsletters - but only AFTER i&#x27;ve read ENOUGH articles to convince me that the newsletter will be of value to me.<p>If I really do Like an article, I&#x27;ll post the link directly on my own Facebook wall.  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve ever just clicked a Like button in an article.<p>There are all kinds of ways for online advertising to be made more effective with some time, effort and insight.<p>What I see are the kinds of desperate measures that result in famine victims eating their seed corner.<p>Please let me be clear: I am grateful for your response.<p>My actual hope is, if not to actually prevent such an economic collapse, at least find some way to contribute to its prevention by bringing my concerns to the attentions of those who are in positions to do something about it.",1428593306

Gruber exists only to entice and encourage others to want, desire and do all things Apple. His post history is demonstration of this.<p>It doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s paid directly by Apple, but benefits from Apple&#x27;s success. He&#x27;s not a &quot;tech blogger&quot; he&#x27;s an &quot;Apple blogger&quot;. If he was being paid directly he&#x27;d be an astroturfer. I&#x27;m using &quot;shill&quot; very precisely here.<p>> The market right now can be divided into two sections; things like the Pebble, and watches-with-apps (Apple Watch, Android Wear). For the latter category, which way you go entirely depends on what sort of phone you have,<p>But he <i>does</i> compare it. This article is not an analysis-in-a-isolation. He explicitly compares the Apple Watch to regular timepieces, and in such a way that it generally compares favorably to those devices -- then he spends a few paragraphs excusing why it&#x27;s not that great of a watch.<p>He doesn&#x27;t compare it against other smart watches or other fitness tracking devices <i>at all</i>, but both are market segments the Apple Watch explicitly markets towards, which he spends almost 1/6th of this essay talking about. It&#x27;s not that I think the Apple Watch would fare poorly against those other devices, but that it brings up uncomfortable questions about the entire segment that Gruber isn&#x27;t prepared to talk about because Apple hasn&#x27;t told him how to talk about it (either directly or through their marketing and advertising channels).<p>> so a comparison arguably isn&#x27;t particularly worthwhile.<p>Why wouldn&#x27;t a comparison be worthwhile? They all have significant product overlap, the Venn diagram of all smart watches is almost a circle, while the Venn diagram with traditional watches is not. Yet he chose to spend 1,000 words on the regular timepiece comparison, and zero words on the market segment. I&#x27;m positing that this wasn&#x27;t an accident. It&#x27;s an easy comparison to make against the rest of the offerings in the segment.<p>- The battery life is better than just about any Android Watch on the market<p>- It&#x27;s not as good as a Pebble<p>- But the screen and functionality is better than a Pebble, and most of the Android watches on the market<p>- The styling of the Apple watch appears to be better than other competing watches on the market<p>- But this comes at a cost, it&#x27;s among the most expensive devices in the segment<p>- You also have to be in the Apple ecosystem to use it<p>There, that&#x27;s easy. My mini-comparison review even makes the Apple Watch look like a good choice. It&#x27;s because that&#x27;s what a critical analysis looks like. You don&#x27;t set the outcome of your review then fudge in 6,000 words to support it.<p>By not doing that there&#x27;s only a few possibilities:<p>- In all the years that smart watches have been out, he&#x27;s never bothered to even check one out, showing an extreme lack of interest in the segment, he&#x27;s only now interested at all because Apple has put one out. This is useless.<p>- Now that he has an Apple watch, he could go to the his local electronics store and just use the novel technique of <i>looking</i> at a few competitors and give some impressions. He didn&#x27;t and this is also useless.<p>- He <i>did</i> do the above, and doesn&#x27;t want to write about it, because several years into the market now, the competitor&#x27;s offerings are more mature and compare better to the Apple Watch. By not writing about this issue, he&#x27;s shilling and is useless.<p>- He already decided to write a positive review about the Watch. This is preordained, since he <i>always</i> says positive things about Apple products. He acts like the rest of the market doesn&#x27;t exist or is irrelevant, but $20 Casio watches are. This is useless.<p>The only useful thing he could have done, <i>at minimum</i> is say &quot;I&#x27;ll be doing a comparison test against the rest of the market in an upcoming article&quot;, at a maximum is use some of his 6,000 words to compare against the entire rest of the market.<p>But he doesn&#x27;t and all we know is that Gruber wants you to think he thinks the Apple Watch is good.",1428592933

I think they dismiss declarative approaches with too broad of strokes, but there is always room for frank discussion of lighter, straightforward approaches that get the job done. This overlaps with Codecademy&#x27;s messaging architecture with React presented by Bonnie Eisenman at React Conf [1], except Codecademy took it a step further and dynamically generated the mediator linkage using mixins pertaining to the views in play for a given screen.<p>We pretty much write desktop apps in this style but run into problems in some complex situations, so I am parsing this for clues to where we may be letting problems sneak in. The rule that programmatic UI updates never raise events may be such a clue, indicating some views are doing too much direct interaction with both local state and subviews.<p>Question: are there rules to apply to this architecture to help with data modularity up and across the view tree? A lot of the work around React right now has to do with creating techniques to avoid passing state across levels that don&#x27;t directly depend on it. For example, communicating an event two levels up without involving the intervening parent or communicating across subviews that don&#x27;t share a common parent. As I read the OP, you have to pass the event all the way up and the state all the way down, coupling the dataflow and triggering rerenders pretty much all along the path.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM6wXoFTY3o&feature=youtu.be"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM6wXoFTY3o&feature=youtu.be</a>",1428592588

However, that&#x27;s the risk that Pincus took in signing these contracts in the first place.

Of the two parks I worked at, one was completely fenced off from deer while the other had small sections fenced off to study the impact of deer on forest regeneration [0]. The caged park had a number of rare plants and if deer got in (which happened pretty frequently), we would drop everything and corral them out of the park. The second park was much too large to cage, but the park system allowed hunters to hunt during certain times of the year.<p>[0]<a href=""http://co.monmouth.nj.us/documents/127/deer_annual_report_2013_2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://co.monmouth.nj.us/documents/127/deer_annual_report_20...</a>",1428592167

However, there are much better options these days for targeted developer video courses (e.g. Egghead, Tuts+, Laracasts, etc.).

If someone makes a conscious decision about what they would like to do with their own body, and that includes having sex in exchange for money, then that is their prerogative and they should have the opportunity to do so via a well-regulated &quot;system&quot; of sorts.<p>&quot;Illegal pornography&quot; is too general a term for this type of discussion. Sodomy is still illegal in many places throughout the world, including fourteen states in the US as of April of last year, but is something that can be a very enjoyable experience for everyone involved. If the &quot;illegal&quot; pornography involves individuals who are capable of making a conscious choice about the acts they engage in, then yes, it should be legal. If the &quot;illegal&quot; pornography involves coercion and/or rape of anyone, or animal, involved, then no, it should remain illegal.",1428591653
