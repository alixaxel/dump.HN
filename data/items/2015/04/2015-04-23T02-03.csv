9424759,comment,9420991,9420991,0,0,varunjuice,,,"Thanks for writing this. I&#x27;m no veteran of startups but I did have the privilege in a previous role of seeing near failure up close, working very hard to ensure we grazed the graveyard, and are now (my former team that is) growing steadily.<p>The items you highlight are common across almost all startups, so the lessons I draw are meaningful across the board.<p>1/ Design startups for speed. There is no way in hell you will get rid of false positives. You need to make sure you survive enough till you hit a true positive. This does NOT mean writing more code faster. In fact, this means do NOT write any code if you can avoid it. Learn though extremely cheap means even if the means only return 10% of the signal of a working product. If people don&#x27;t absolutely fall in love with the prototype, it&#x27;s not going to work.<p>2/ Don&#x27;t be blinded by big names. Big name customers love to stay in the know about what is going on. They also have inflated self worth. Go after the small guys, and start using that to beat the drum around the big guys. In a past role when I was selling, I was walked out of the building by a VP who called in to get rid of me. 2 years later they called me because smaller competitors had better products than they did.<p>3/ Engagement with a small feature matters a LOT - I agree with your take that deepening engagement for almost all companies prior to growth is a bad idea. It is relatively easier to find a &quot;feature&quot; 1 user likes, and then scale it out to other users, than deepen engagement with that user.",1429757412

It&#x27;s getting an unfair advantage by using techniques that your opponents wouldn&#x27;t use.<p>Consider this: Imagine a fighting game which is unbalanced. &#x27;Unbalanced&#x27;, here, means that one character is so inherently better that using it is a victory condition in itself; maybe it can spam a really effective move without giving the opponent a chance to retaliate. Whatever the details, the person who chooses that character is guaranteed a victory assuming they play to win.<p>In that case, the community of people who play that game would effectively ban the character to make the game as it is played more balanced. Anyone who picks that character would be unable to find opponents, and everyone else would restrict themselves to the characters which offer both players a chance to win.<p>My point is, in that not-entirely-contrived scenario, doing something the game software allows <i>is cheating</i> because it is <i>something the game community has agreed to be cheating</i>. Cheating has little to do with what the un-hacked code allows. In fact, in this case, hacking the code to remove the unbalanced character (or, more likely, to make that character unavailable on the selection screen) would <i>remove</i> a possible cheat, making the hacked version <i>less</i> amenable to cheating.<p>David Sirlin wrote a book called &quot;Playing To Win&quot; which touches on a lot of what I just talked about.

9424627,comment,9423545,9423545,0,0,mikekchar,,,"Very interesting to reflect on the amount of time needed to write a technical book on a programming language.  If I compare that to amount of time taken to write code (and forgive me for the horrible KLOC metric), I think one could easily average about 300 lines of good C++ code (including tests) per day on a new project -- probably more if you are working alone, but let&#x27;s keep it conservative.  So about 37.5 lines per hour * 1350 hours = ~50KLOC.  Say half of it is tests, so that&#x27;s a medium sized app.<p>I don&#x27;t know why, but writing a book seems waaay more effort than churning out ~25 KLOC of tested C++.  I guess it is what you are used to...<p>* 300 lines per day is what I averaged over a multi-year period when I was a C++ programmer.  But that was more than a decade ago, so I&#x27;m guessing it would take less lines of code with &quot;Effective Modern C++&quot; ;-) (and yes, I measured it for interest sake...)",1429754682
