Think how React influenced the changes in rendering models of Ember, Angular, etc.<p>Always baffles me how HN crowd can at the same time revere Lean/Agile mindset, and at the same time despise the same principles applied to the tools ecosystem. To me it&#x27;s obvious that to make progress of any kind multiple attempts are needed. Naturally only few of all those experiments will survive, the thing is nobody knows which ones.",1430128787

We&#x27;ve had one accident where a bottle exploded in the hands of a college of mine. He got a good scar up his arm, but nothing deadly. He had to get sewn, but that was about it.<p>Most often though, if you fill up the bottle with too much nitrogen, it won&#x27;t explode. It&#x27;ll just freeze up and slowly disperse through whatever cracks are present. If it didn&#x27;t explode over night, it probably wouldn&#x27;t have at all.<p>I suspect it might have started to fizzle due to air leaving the bag, or due to a small leak, which is pretty harmless. Nitrogen explosions of half-litre bottles are very large, and can shake the ground 20-30m away. I can test it later today if time permits and upload a video, but overall, it would&#x27;ve been much clearer if it went off.<p>Edit: to people saying the cap is the weak point: 9/10 times it&#x27;s the bottom that gives in first.",1430128718

Nearly all admins and auditors both immeditally jump to the list of checks, and start going down the list. It can be  manually, or with an assessment tool, but for every instance where the value in bit position &quot;X&quot; doesn&#x27;t match what&#x27;s in the book, it&#x27;s a &quot;finding, and must be changed&quot;.<p>I think tools like these are useful, but they&#x27;re almost always used in the wrong way. I tell my admins that these tools aren&#x27;t to assess the risk to a system (which is far more complicated a measurement than a single checklist) but an awareness tool. The lists are to make you aware of services and entries you&#x27;re exposing in the system. They&#x27;re not inherently vulnerabilities if they&#x27;re part of a well-conceived service who&#x27;s proper operation and potential risks have been accounted for.

If a person without many assets(expensive home--mainly), and just has unsecured debt; a straight chapter 7 is something a lawyer could guarantee.(As long as the client is completely honest?)

Most of these books need a lot of time to skim, read, reflect, exercise, etc.<p>For example, surely he is going to recommend math books. It can be argued that most of the value of a math book is in its end-of-chapter exercise set, and that takes time. If discrete mathematics book A is more amenable to a 30 minute random page read and book B has a lot of insight in working through the questions after chapter 7, how can he reliably evaluate that, across a lot of published books in the area? And then jump to grammar, and then to programming languages, and then to best practices, and repeat that?<p>I mean, I love these posts, because they give me a list of books to research and &quot;collect&quot; in a wish list.

Fair enough, and for this reason a language-specific PM will most likely have more libraries available, so I concede that point.
