Although Xamarin.Forms isn&#x27;t really stable (We experienced quite a lot of regressions with each new version)   neither is Corona.<p>Corona is nice if you have a lot of custom graphics, but if you are going for pretty standard user interaction, you will spend a lot of time recreating what exists on other platforms.<p>For both Xamarin.Forms and Corona you will run into the limitations, but with Forms it is much easier to adjust those with native code.<p>I think the main issue with Corona is that they are more focussed on the game case (for which it works)<p>Finally, I really started to appreciate C# after doing Lua, PHP and JavaScript for years.  Especially on a complex app, the static typing really helps making changes to code you did not write yourself.",1428231585

9323686,comment,9317916,9321959,0,0,ZenoArrow,,,"&quot;I&#x27;m starting to think maybe the problem is that you&#x27;re charmingly naive (and I mean that well): you&#x27;re a genuinely positive person with thick skin and an earnest desire to communicate.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s one of the highest compliments I&#x27;ve ever received! Even naïve sounds heroic to me in the way you put it. Thank you very much!<p>&quot;Maybe today that reacted badly with a gruff and grumbling persona&quot;<p>Maybe, but it wasn&#x27;t completely uncalled for. For what it&#x27;s worth, I understood the risk of asking for clarity with a leading question, it&#x27;s not the first time it has backfired. Sometimes I forget people need to vent freely, as I often want to cut to the core of the matter. It&#x27;s possibly a sign of impatience, I&#x27;ll try to give people more time in the future.<p>To be clear, whilst I certainly do desire peaceful resolution of conflict, I&#x27;m also interested in the truth. Whilst all truth is subjective, it should bear to stand up to a certain amount of scrutiny. You&#x27;re quite right that mreiland made a level-headed comment about writing people off and subsequently got written off, my only real feedback was that such a response was predictable. The reasons given for writing off were slightly different (writing off idiocy vs. writing off intolerance) but at the core it&#x27;s the same issue, in that to give is to receive in return. I don&#x27;t know mreiland&#x27;s history, and maybe he/she has more reason than most to write some people off quickly, all I can say is that it&#x27;s a vicious cycle. I hoped some exploration of it could help change that cycle, but it didn&#x27;t work out this time, no problem, time for me to let it go.<p>Thank you for your thoughtful response throwawaymaroon, it was very much appreciated.",1428231168

Always. The Jews weren&#x27;t persecuted in Germany without justification. And there were always pretexts for every lynching of a black or asian person in the US. But those justifications and those pretexts always skipped more than a few steps of logic. In every case the &quot;out group&quot; is made to live up to impossible, unrealistic standards of perfection of which failure to live up to serves as justification for them being ostracized and segregated, nevermind that those standards aren&#x27;t ever applied with the same intensity for members of the &quot;in group&quot;.<p>You can&#x27;t just blithely use this &quot;oh, everyone is at fault in this whole mess, tut tut&quot; excuse to remove the blame from the people who deserve it.<p>The fact is that women have long faced double standards that were impossible to live up to. Moreover, they have long faced a heightened level of abuse, especially online. This whole thing is nothing new, it&#x27;s just an escalation, an intensification, for what&#x27;s been going on, often without much publicity, previously. I have numerous female friends who&#x27;ve been avid gamers for, in some cases, decades, and they all have stories that I have not experienced. Stories of creeps, stories of unwarranted excessive abuse and intense threats of violence. I&#x27;ve only had one semi-serious threat made against me online in my 20 years of using the internet, but women have routinely faced such threats for years and years.<p>This is not at all a recent thing. Kathy Sierra spent years maintaining a low public profile due to online threats against her. She&#x27;s just one of many similar examples. There is a pervasive sub-culture of misogynist assholes who have been actively fighting the influence of women in &quot;tech&quot;, and there is an even larger group of idiots who don&#x27;t realize that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening and pretend like it&#x27;s just a small problem or some sort of schoolyard tussle where everyone is at fault to some degree.",1428231099

Less than 20% of milk produced in the US uses rBGH, and most health organizations, including in Canada and Europe, agree that milk from rBGH/rBST cows is safe for humans.  The reason it&#x27;s banned in the EU and Canada is because it&#x27;s a health risk for cows, not people.  And the reason you&#x27;re not likely to get US fresh milk in those countries has more to do with transportation costs than production standards.<p>If I had to guess, I&#x27;d say the most likely reasons for flavor differences are 1) different pasteurization techniques 2) fat content 3) consumption temperature (you can&#x27;t taste sugars as well when they&#x27;re cold).",1428231081

C isn&#x27;t moving at the pace C++ is so given that most (all?) of the OpenBSD base is C and sh, LTS will work with base, no problem. It&#x27;s important too that developers are rather happy with what C99 brings to the table so it&#x27;s a solid reference point for any LTS compiler that would/could happen. It&#x27;s ports, I think, where the problem is. A lot of that code is C++ so you need compiler and std lib implementation to be able to handle it. But there are two problem.<p>First one: the quality of ports varies from project to project. There&#x27;s code out there that depends on certain gcc-specific extension, compiler quirks, bugs, you name it. C++ is insanely complex and features just keep piling on. I bet the moment C++17 is available some projects start using certain features because they can. In this case C++ is a moving target and it&#x27;s hard to imagine LTE C++ compiler for open source projects.<p>Second one: AFAIK only gcc&#x27;s standard library has support for all of the wacky constructs C++ requires. You&#x27;re probably out of luck if you try to compile C++ code with thread local storage intermingled with exceptions and you want to depends on non-GPL musl or bionic (which would be important for projects like OpenBSD). And there&#x27;s code depending on that in ports, you can bet on it.<p>Until these problems are solved[1], OpenBSD won&#x27;t migrate. LLVM could become the LTS compiler for projects that would benefit from using it, but it doesn&#x27;t look like a complete operating system is a project that would fit.<p>[1] plus some others, like backends available for more than x86/64, arm, mips, PPC, Sparc and z (or whatever the list is today); OpenBSD supports quite a few esoteric platforms",1428229883

Since you are using &quot;parts&quot; of the universe(like photon/electron beams, stones, chopsticks) to measure other parts of the same universe, of course there are limits on your precision and artifacts within those measurements. Lets do a gedankenexperiment; imagine that you just entered a porcelain shop but your vision is based on arbitrary-sized plastic projectile gun and a (smart)detector wall that detects all projectiles that bumped of a scanned surface within a certain angle. Now there is only a range of momentums(velocity/weight combinations) that would let you scan that environment within an acceptable resolution - the point is that you can&#x27;t have an arbitrary resolution(either there is air-resistance or unavoidable damage to the environment or or).. I&#x27;ll jump ahead a few steps and go right to the underlying question, and that is whether the universe is deterministic or not - which in context of the above is actually pretty straight-forward(again, personal view) - since as &quot;inhabitants&quot; of the universe we want to measure we are bound to use parts of the universe to do our measurements, newtons predicable clockwork universe indeed has its limitations(and I really don&#x27;t see why this is such an issue when c is accepted without friction, if you have no problems dealing with c why on earth do you have such problems with this which directly follows). Regardless of whether we live in a deterministic universe or not we can&#x27;t have arbitrary resolution so from practical point of view - for us - its the same as if the universe &quot;at-its-core&quot; was not deterministic(there is no way to get that probability line under control when time increases). Now as a pure philosophical question, whether our universe is really deterministic or not depends on the model we use(in &quot;bubble-like-multiverses&quot; there is no interaction between universe-bubbles possible hence deterministic, in eternal inflation models it gets spread from deterministic to non-deterministic but for all models with interacting universes - only your imagination is the limit, seriously, very potent drug) All in all, one thing is sure - we are the universe experiencing it self sooo enjoy",1428229488
