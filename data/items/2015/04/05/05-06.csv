9323259,comment,9322797,9322797,0,0,MCRed,,,"I think a more interesting question is, how has the ROI of college changed over the past 40 years?<p>The cost has gone up much faster than inflation.<p>The number of people going to college has also risen dramatically.  This means there are a lot more college educated peers competing with you in the workplace.  This means that the college degree is not as rare, and thus has lower scarcity value.<p>Finally, I think it&#x27;s quite possible the quality of the education has declined significantly in the past 40 years.  When I was in college, almost 30 years ago, I was appalled at how the university focused and spent so much of its money on a losing football team (in a zero sum situation where the other schools were always going to be abel to massively outspend it and had larger pools of students to recruit from) ... and in the decline in the education.  I remember sitting in a class and learning about how universities were started by tradesman who banded together and hired experts to teach them, and I thought &quot;Man, I wish I could go to a school like that&quot;.  Since then I&#x27;ve seen nothing but an increase in these efforts... I&#x27;ve see the quality of a CS degree (based on the people who I interview for jobs who have them) decline.<p>So the formula is:  More Cost, Less Value, Lower Quality = Lower ROI.<p>If things don&#x27;t turn around, at some point College will be a losing proposition.<p>Of course, this presumes that the education colleges give can be obtained elsewhere.<p>Which brings up another point MOOCs, and online access to open source frameworks have really changed things in the past 30 years.  30 years ago we were buying our compilers (CodeWarrior for life!) now they and our frameworks are open source and well documented.  The books are cheaper-- $40 to Oreilley rather than $120 to the campus book store (or are my prices out of date?)<p>You can learn more modern technologies better than going to college and spending 4 years on Java and C++.<p>Then there&#x27;s the MooCs. you can learn CS fundamentals by video, along with people all around the world.<p>I think we&#x27;re close to that tipping point.",1428213330

I bring it in with npm, then copy the bootstrap.less and variables.less into my own project (updating the references to those in the node_modules path)... this lets me do quite a bit in terms of not loading the kitchen sink, while still being flexible.<p>As an aside, I&#x27;m not quite sure why less hasn&#x27;t won over sass...  By nature of less being JS driven it is much closer to best in breed tools you need anyway for web development (npm) in my opinion.  It kind of bugs me that to do modern web development, you are likely to want/need to have Node (or io.js), Python and Ruby installed.  I tend to stick to Node based tools (there is sass for node, but it brings in a binary module).  This isn&#x27;t to be expressly negative, just that I&#x27;m surprised there&#x27;s still broad support for both less and sass... with sass having a bit of an edge in the greater community, it would seem.",1428213318

It basically holds true for any product: price doesn&#x27;t increase linearly as quality goes up.<p>I go to college in U.S., and a lot friends of mine attend one of the best universities in China. I have the freedom to take practically any course in the university, and my friends basically know what their four years look like before freshman year. I never worry about finding seats in the library, and my friends sometimes have to camp outside before it opens near finals. I have plenty of resources (Profs, TAs, advisors, peer tutors) when I get stuck, whereas my friends mostly have to figure it out on their own. I&#x27;ve been living in singles since freshman year, and my friends have dorm rooms that are slightly larger than mine, but with four students living in it. They don&#x27;t even have shower in the dorm and have to go to a communal facility. Their bathrooms are dark, dirty and don&#x27;t have bowls (squat toilets), while ours are some of the cleanest I&#x27;ve seen.<p>On the other hand, I pay almost $50k in tuition alone each year, while my friends pay <$1000.

The official Intel/AMD manuals make no reference to octal either, using only binary and hex.<p>As an aside, ARM opcodes are (mostly) hex-structured with 4-bit fields, while MIPS, POWER, and SPARC are not amenable to any standard number base except binary (5- and 6-bit fields.)",1428213277

What about all the error cases?<p>If you&#x27;re writing for the web, it&#x27;s clear you can&#x27;t even try to really understand how everything works in all cases across all machines.<p>Few programmers really understand how computer memory works, but if everyone were to read this guide (<a href=""http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf</a>) and really learn it throughly, the net benefit probably wouldn&#x27;t be that great vs other things they could do with that time.<p>It&#x27;s great fun to track down every last misunderstanding or bug, but it&#x27;s probably not worth it over the long term.

This is useful for a number of reasons:<p>1) If you made the bug, you probably have some misunderstanding of the system that will be fixed when you understand the bug.<p>2) If you&#x27;re spending your time fixing an actual bug, then the misunderstanding empirically matters because this mistake has been made and actually affects someone.<p>3) You tend not to accumulate a lot of superstition in your code, which makes the code much easier to read.",1428212079

9323228,comment,9322797,9323128,0,0,mdasen,,,"Economists sometimes talk about different types of quality: actual quality and perceived quality.  There has been a lot of spending that has been directed toward perceived quality at American Universities.  That includes a lot of new buildings, a lot of maintenance, etc.  In a certain way, it becomes a race to spend more.  The more you spend, the better students you can attract, the better your status is and your alumni and industry donations are.  All of this spending to entice 16 and 17 year olds to choose your university over another based on a cool study area, the prospect of free concerts, lots of student life staff to talk to and handle your needs, etc.<p>In the United States, university education is extremely hierarchical.  If you&#x27;re fairly well off (parents earning $120,000/year), you can easily get a free education at one of the top schools.  However, go to a school closer to 25th and there will be fees even for those whose parents earn less.  I don&#x27;t think most countries third-level systems are nearly as hierarchical.  As such, it&#x27;s a big deal for universities to compete for students (and students to compete for universities) in the US.<p>A lot of that probably comes from American universities being completely independent of one another.  I mean, sure, Imperial College London is independent from University College London, but they&#x27;re ultimately responsible to the UK government.  I don&#x27;t think unbridled spending to court students from one government institution to another (via perceived, not actual quality) would really be looked upon well.<p>To be fair, the lack of coordination can also put American universities in an awkward position.  As soldiers came home and took advantage of the GI Bill, universities greatly expanded their capacity to teach them.  As that large increase in students dropped off, universities were left with a lot of excess capacity.  A lot of the increase in spending can be traced back to that period as universities tried to keep their enrolment steady.<p>Ultimately, American universities are a combination of school and summer camp.  Generally students live in university-owned dorms, they eat in university-owned cafeterias, and go to university-sponsored social events.  All of that costs money, but in a competitive environment where students travel across the country to go to the university they perceive as best (that let them in), those costs are necessary from the university&#x27;s perspective.",1428212073

There you mark down what you want and how many pieces each. Fill out like three of them and submit them to your server after you&#x27;ve got your drinks settled, and you should get them pretty quick. If they don&#x27;t have these cards, you may not get your order quickly.<p>Sometimes it&#x27;s hit or miss; check the reviews online first. Back where I grew up in Florida there was a place where you&#x27;d get your order in less than two minutes, but the quality wasn&#x27;t very good.<p>For an &#x27;authentic experience&#x27;, you want a simple place with an old japanese guy or two behind a bar watching a baseball game on a tiny tube TV, possibly with some shouting going on. This is super rare in the US from my perspective, but I have found a few places like this in south florida, so you may have luck elsewhere too.<p>For just a &#x27;good sushi&#x27; experience, you want either a japanese convenience store that makes sushi to order, a super pretentious expensive place pretending to be a high end sushi/sake bar, or a place that randomly has a really well trained chef that imports really quality ingredients [which is typically only pretentious expensive places]. Food blogs are a good resource, though they can often be more pretentious than the restaurants.<p>I like to try out new places and order either chirashi or whatever the chef&#x27;s nigiri special is, maybe with tuna or beef tataki beforehand to see their prep skills. Most places that don&#x27;t have japanese chefs fuck up the tataki, and you can usually predict the rest of the quality from there. If you don&#x27;t get paper thin slices or they come back over-seared, your sushi is gonna be sub-par.<p>Note: the best sushi i&#x27;ve ever eaten in my life was last year at the now-closed Barracuda in the Castro, so don&#x27;t overthink it, just order some nigiri and see what happens.",1428210369
