Creativity and opinions matter. It&#x27;s not just preventing crime.<p>The inevitable risk is that the government or corporations could use this information advantage, and not really prevent crime at all since criminal would be even more careful. It could turn into situations of black and white like in china where saying something would put you in trouble.<p>Although it is true that the NSA should be able to investigate data when there is reasonable suspicion (a good example is finance, dealing with large amount of money should mean you&#x27;re being monitored), I don&#x27;t think it should be mandatory for all civilians.<p>Civilization implies a social contract, but is it really a good idea to have more and more dependency and supervision by government ? I think not.

This is something over which the user can retain full control without involving third parties.  As it should be.<p>TLS might have encryption that works well enough to &quot;secure a connection&quot; but if I am not mistaken it still has no reliable way to verify an endpoint (recipient) is the one you want it to be.

The German economic recovery after WW2 should have been a blueprint for how to deal with the Greek situation. Germany received both cash infusions (the Marshall plan) and benefited from the deferral of debt (the London Agreement on German External Debts) that required Germany to only repay debts when a trade surplus allowed for it. It was a strategy that allowed both economic growth <i>and</i> debt service. Instead, Greece was strangled by an austerity regimen that impeded economic growth and as a consequence also made it impossible for Greece to fix its debt issues.<p>Yes, the Greek government <i>was</i> cooking the books when it joined the Euro, but as you correctly point out, that doesn&#x27;t even come close to starting a couple of world wars. Policy-making should focus on fixing economic problems (that 99% of the population aren&#x27;t responsible for), not exercises in finger-pointing.",1433519437
9666189,comment,9664203,9664916,0,0,nemothekid,,,"The GP is right, I started using Cassandra right before they got a hardon for &quot;CQL&quot; and the docs used to explicitly layout the data model when using the thrift interface. (The Thrift data model is basically what you get when you use COMPACT STORAGE, we still using CQL). Simply put, I bet the 30x increase in performance is <i>not</i> because they used COMPACT STORAGE, and is because Map/collections have terrible performance, and COMPACT STORAGE forced them describe the data the &quot;right&quot; way.<p>Instead of using a map (or COMPACT STORAGE), they should have defined their schema upfront (one of the limitations brought on by not-SQL). However if they didn&#x27;t want to do that then COMPACT STORAGE is obviously a better solution than using a Map.<p>To answer your question about COMPACT STORAGE, standard CQL basically does the work for you (in terms of parsing the &quot;xsv&quot;) but you have you define the schema upfront (as in, you have know all the map keys before hand). The reason they tell you not to use COMPACT STORAGE is for those cases where you don&#x27;t need a dynamic schema, using COMPACT STORAGE doesn&#x27;t really get you anything.<p>Lastly, IMO, I wouldn&#x27;t touch CQL Collections or COMPACT STORAGE unless absolutely necessary.

We are big users/consumers/fans of Cassandra at Spotify. We have approximately one crap-ton of Cassandra clusters with several metric crap-tons of data. But we have an entire team that provides support and tooling around Cassandra. We contribute upstream, and have employed core Cassandra contributors in the past.<p>In return we get a datastore that scales pretty much infinitely with our data sets, has performance characteristics that we are now well aware of and are able to reason about, and provides us cross-DC replication and topology-awareness. It took years to get to this point though, and to build the operational expertise required to run Cassandra. Only recently have we gotten to the point where teams are able to self-service provision their own Cassandra clusters.<p>This is a resilient, scalable solution, but if I were to quit tomorrow and start a five-person startup, there is no way I would consider C* as a workable solution.",1433518004

In everyday life many societies classify populations into groups based on phenotypical traits and impressions of probable geographic ancestry and socio-economic status - these are the groups we tend to call &quot;races&quot;. Because the patterns of variation of human genetic traits are clinal, with a gradual change in trait frequency between population clusters, it is possible to statistically correlate clusters of physical traits with individual geographic ancestry. The frequencies of alleles tend to form clusters where populations live closely together and interact over periods of time. This is due to endogamy within kin groups and lineages or national, cultural or linguistic boundaries. This causes genetic clusters to correlate statistically with population groups when a number of alleles are evaluated. Different clines align around the different centers, resulting in more complex variations than those observed comparing continental groups.&quot;<p>In short it&#x27;s saying genetic traits can be statistically correlated with population groups (race) but variations of traits that are different within population groups can actually be more complex than those observed when compared with people outside of their race.<p>This is literally exactly my argument.

The most obvious counter-example is that the US and the UK spend the same amount of tax money as a percentage of GDP on healthcare; the former gets limited programs covering a minority of the population, the latter gets a universal health service (albeit obviously with limitations).<p>2) On what basis do you say that no large scale NGO disaster responses work out well? I would say that is an incredibly difficult conclusion to draw.",1433516421
