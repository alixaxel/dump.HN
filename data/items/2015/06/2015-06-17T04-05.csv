But I wonder if that&#x27;s the right direction for them to go.<p>Object storage is a hard area to compete in.  Amazon drives prices very low and when you&#x27;re talking about object storage, durability is really important.  Rackspace and LiquidWeb charge $0.10 and $0.08 per GB which is around 3x more than Amazon charges.  I&#x27;m not sure Linode offering object storage for $0.08/GB would attract much business.  HP offers it for $0.09 and Joyent for $0.043.  Linode customers can use S3 for their storage in many cases.  The case it doesn&#x27;t work for are workloads where you&#x27;re going to want the data more local like running Hive queries off S3 data.  Would an expensive Linode S3 competitor be worth it?<p>A memory optimized plan could make a bit of sense, but then Linode would really need to hammer out what CPU you&#x27;re paying for on the standard plans.  A lot of VPS providers are giving you &quot;vCPU&quot; ratings, but who knows what that translates to.  Linode tells us that their servers use Ivy Bridge E5-2680 v2 processors.  But how many?  Let&#x27;s say that it has two processors.  That means 20 cores and 40 virtual cores via HT.  OK, how many Linodes can fit on one of these boxes.  At least 96GB of Linodes.  If it&#x27;s 96GB of Linodes, 96 1-GB Linodes would mean 96 vCPUs - way more than there are processors.  However, 1 96-GB Linode would have 20 vCPUs, less than the processors have.  Amazon is a lot more through about what CPU resources you&#x27;re getting.  If Linode were to make a distinction between high-memory and high-CPU instances, you&#x27;d want it to be more than just &quot;cores&quot;.  If you&#x27;re creating a compute cluster, the compute resources you&#x27;re getting matter.  Maybe this is more of a generalization of your suggestion: Linode needs to provide more resource options <i>and</i> make what resources you&#x27;re paying for clearer.<p>A CDN would be an easy add-on for Linode, but without object storage, is it that interesting?  I&#x27;m sure Fastly or someone else would let Linode white-label, but is it so important to have a CDN from the same provider that does your other infrastructure?<p>I think some of these are wanting Linode to be something that it isn&#x27;t.  Amazon has made AWS into a general store for compute, network, and storage stuff.  You want to analyze petabytes of information?  Stick it onto S3, bring it down to compute nodes with the right balance of IO, memory, disk, and CPU to do your analysis, etc.  Linode is more &quot;you want a VPS?  We have VPSs!&quot;  And they&#x27;re pretty great at it.  They&#x27;re fast, the SSDs are wonderful, and they&#x27;ve been a reliable member of the community for over a decade.  Heck, you can even get a load balancer to handle 10,000 simultaneous connections for $20.  The stuff you need to run a decent site.  Digital Ocean, who likely has more funding at its disposal, hasn&#x27;t gone beyond this.<p>Maybe it will be the next step for Linode (and DO).  To get there, I think those VPS providers will have to get more serious about what resources a user actually gets.",1434515629

Personally I always recommend this for any employment contract. The cost of one decent lawyer for an hour vs. the potential risk that an employer sneaked something irrevocable and completely disproportionate in? It&#x27;s not even close.<p>That said, I once had exactly the described problem: post-acquisition, new company wants to adjust a lot of contractual wording on things like IP heavily in their favour, at a software business where many of the staff are also creative outside work in one way or another. Most of my colleagues didn&#x27;t realise the implications of the proposed IP clauses and in particular the potential impact on their time outside office hours until these dangers were pointed out, but many strongly disliked the new terms once awareness was raised.<p>Without getting into details I possibly shouldn&#x27;t, let&#x27;s just say that what the acquiring company&#x27;s lawyers or HR people would like to happen will probably be outweighed by a significant proportion of staff from the acquired company refusing to sign the oppressive deal and threatening to walk. If you can reach critical mass, management is likely to step in and do what they have to so they can protect the new investment and CTA. In the end, the wording of the relevant sections in our new contracts was identical to the corresponding sections in our old contracts.<p>Incidentally, probably one of the biggest mistakes of my professional career was sticking around for too long after I already knew what kind of business the new employer was from their initial behaviour.

Fireworks is(was) very good at dealing with web assets,it was easy to write macros and extensions in JS, Dreamweaver has good templating capabilities (a bit like static site generators) which makes maintaining complex layouts on multiple pages really really easy for web designers.<p>The issue with Dreamweaver is obviously the fact that it&#x27;s out of touch with modern web design (very little support for CSS frameworks and pre-processors, text editor below average, and of course Adobe succeeded in killing the best thing Macromedia had achieved,creating an awesome community around its products).As for Fireworks it&#x27;s dead.<p>So designers like me are always watching for alternative tools that could replace these. There is a serious need for innovation in that space. I don&#x27;t think the UI for such a tool should be 100% web based however.",1434514444
9730030,comment,9726341,9729848,0,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Primary incentives embodied in the patent system include incentives to invent in the first place; to disclose the invention once made; to invest the sums necessary to experiment, produce and market the invention; and to design around and improve upon earlier patents.<p>This is two goals, stated as four:<p>1. There should be more technology developed under a patent system than otherwise.<p>2. People should stop keeping their technology secret.<p>> Main article: History of patent law<p>> Patents were systematically granted in Venice as of 1450, where they issued a decree by which new and inventive devices had to be communicated to the Republic in order to obtain legal protection against potential infringers.<p>Goal #2 is the origin of the system, and the only goal that the system directly addresses.<p>So let&#x27;s take a common example of a trade secret protected by American law: a company&#x27;s customer list.<p>I don&#x27;t see the argument that businesses wouldn&#x27;t bother developing customers in the absence of trade secret law. Nor do I see why protecting that information is in the interest of anyone outside that particular company. It&#x27;s definitely <i>contrary</i> to the interests of the customers.<p>The Uniform Trade Secrets Act explicitly states that it&#x27;s intended to protect businesses who believe that their information is nonpatentable:<p>> &quot;In view of the substantial number of patents that the courts invalidate, many businesses now elect to protect commercially valuable information by relying on the state trade secret protection law.&quot;<p>And hey, for secrets like a customer list those businesses are surely correct. But <i>who cares?</i> Trade secrets are by definition something the business felt was worth the effort of developing regardless of patentability concerns. Any hypothetical benefits to society are, at best, extremely precarious -- <i>that&#x27;s why we have patent law</i>. Trade secret protections are an undisguised, pointless giveaway, and they undermine the goals of the patent system.",1434514431

Which, to be honest, was the reason I qualified the statement as &quot;in the US, ...&quot;<p>> In the US, you have Fox News. Whatever you might think<p>> about the message Fox News is sending out, they control<p>> the message that people hear. In general, the media<p>> controls the narrative. A small number of media outlets<p>> are the real beneficiaries of free speech. In what way<p>> are their opponents able to speak?<p>I would consider that more a question of Freedom of the Press, although it&#x27;s certainly intertwined with Freedom of Speech.  And there&#x27;s an old quote that &quot;Freedom of the Press only applies to people who have one [a press].&quot;  Luckily, it&#x27;s been getting cheaper to get a message out to, potentially, millions of people.  Occasionally, bloggers embarrass professional reporters.<p>> A small number of powerful elites have unrestricted<p>> control over what speech people actually get to hear. ...<p>><p>> It&#x27;s not too much better than that in the EU but at least<p>> we can prevent a television station or media baron or<p>> cult leader from broadcasting hate speech.<p>I don&#x27;t think the &quot;at least&quot; is something to be happy with.  I realize that the governments currently running France, Germany, Britain, Switzerland, Spain, Portugal, Greece, etc. are more trustworthy than, say, the Russian government.  But you have something of a guarantee that -- no matter how much you trust your current government -- eventually politicians you don&#x27;t trust will take control.  If a government has the authority to punish media owners or reporters, then eventually that authority will be abused.",1434514416
