I had an amazing relationship with my prior banker who happened to be with Bank of America and it got to the point that he couldn&#x27;t help us with anything even a simple notarizing of an important document because it didn&#x27;t  originate from his branch. He used to waive stupid fees for teller help etc but couldn&#x27;t anymore. Given the amount of money I was pushing through his branch I also got very good terms personally before, not anymore.<p>So I switched to a smaller bank, not tiny but where we could get better service and have been much happier.<p>I researched carefully, PNC, TD, BBT and a number of regional banks. Finally went with PNC and have been really happy. And while they aren&#x27;t perfect they really do stress the local relationship and do their best to help out.

The 5.x branch is better in every respect (yes, bugs, but that&#x27;s fixable). This project is breathing life into a version of the lib which <i>really</i> should be dead. I think this is a net negative for Qt.<p>- Why is this the first most of us in the Qt community hear about it? The project is basically coming out of nowhere, imposing itself as this shiny new thing when it has critical flaws and the only point of contact is an email address and a forum with 0 posts in it. Feels like it was developed in complete secrecy.<p>- (minor) Autotools build system, really? You&#x27;re not going to get much respect about this from most Qt devs. Why not just use cmake?<p>- I&#x27;m concerned about the entire way this project came forward. You don&#x27;t have a git repository. You claim you will but claiming things is easy - the question it immediately raises is <i>why</i> don&#x27;t you have a git repository yet? (And this comes back to what I was saying earlier about developing this in secret).<p>The lack of a repository is the second most important issue after 4.x, I think. Git repos aren&#x27;t just &quot;the code&quot;. They&#x27;re insight into how development happens (are commits clean and readable? is it easy to contribute?), insight into <i>who</i> contributes (is it a corp? how many people are working on this?), into whether upstream changes are being pulled down, etc.",1433908047

It is not. The function of the notation is to preserve and communicate an abstract musical idea.<p>That idea is then interpreted by musicians and becomes a &quot;performance&quot;. For example, in a jazz context 8th notes would be played &quot;swinging&quot;, in a similar fashion to the &quot;notes inegales&quot; of baroque music. In early music in general, the idea is that the notes convey only the gist of the music, and the performer is expected to elaborate on them with ornamentations and diminutions.<p>This double life of the music, as an eternal abstract idea and an ephemeral, momentary sound happening, is perhaps the defining characteristic of the classical European tradition.",1433907689

Exploded upper stages, debris from collisions, discarded separation bits and pieces, no-longer-active satellites.<p>4000 is still a large number, especially at a higher LEO altitude where junk lasts forever.

But we don&#x27;t want to split the baby and force them into bankruptcy either.

Lenard and Stark enjoyed the Nazi support because it allowed them to undertake a professional coup for their preferred scientific theory. Under the rallying cry that physics should be more &quot;German&quot; and &quot;Aryan,&quot; Lenard and Stark, with backing from the Nazi leadership, entered on a plan to pressure and replace physics positions at German universities with people teaching their preferred theories. By the late 1930s, there were no longer any Jewish physics professors in Germany, since under the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 Jews were not allowed to work in universities.&quot;<p>&quot;It is occasionally put forth that there is a great irony in the Nazis&#x27; labeling modern physics as &quot;Jewish science&quot;, since it was exactly modern physics—and the work of many European exiles—which was used to create the atomic bomb. Even if the German government had not embraced Lenard and Stark&#x27;s ideas, the German antisemitic agenda was enough by itself to destroy the Jewish scientific community in Germany.&quot;",1433906842

I am the founder of  Control  , a Stripe partner, and the company referenced in this thread.<p>First off, I would like to point out an obvious fact : this is my first post ever on HN. I have observed /admired all of the great discussions on HN for years and have never felt as though I have had anything  useful to contribute (or maybe I was a bit intimidated :)  However, a couple people messaged me  about the thread that has been materializing here- so here I am! I hope I can add an interesting or insightful perspective.<p>Yes, Control has an iOS  dashboard for Stripe merchants. And an Android app. And  a web app , and we have  an iWatch app in development. We have a number of areas where  we are building out a set of capabilities for businesses to manage their payments better. In fact, we have a number of really cool ideas in our pipeline I think anybody who manages payments will find very , very interesting. Contact me to see our roadmap !<p>I have known that Stripe was building an iOS app for months (as Cristina pointed out , since September 2014) and I believe  this is great! I think a free app for Stripe customers looking for very simple functionality is a smart move by Stripe. And the design is sensational, well done!<p>At Control, we are focused on building out  many more capabilities that I believe businesses will find valuable  . For example (just to give a flavor of our thinking):<p>- Real time alerts on transactional behavior indicative of potential fraud occurring 
- Expanded CRM tools in iOs, Android, and web 
- The ability to manage Stripe, PayPal , Dwolla, and more from 1 app<p>We have a number of payment platforms in our radar we want to build business apps around (we already support Paymill in Europe and nearly done integrations to PayPal,  Conekta and PIN Payments). However,  Control deliberately built  around Stripe first because:<p>a. Stripe/Cristina has supported our business model from Day 1 and 
b. I truly believe Stripe&#x27;s approach is the most significant innovation to happen in the payments industry in the last 10 years, because of their philosophy of opening their APIs to the broader developer /app ecosystem. We love Stripe and we love being able to add value to their customers<p>We are proud to be a Stripe partner and hope to continue growing and innovating alongside with them.<p>I should point out that one of our investors /advisors is the Hootsuite CEO, Ryan Holmes. The best advice Ryan gave me was not too worry too much about the prospect of Stripe releasing a free app,  but to keep innovating and building distinctive value.  Hootsuite&#x27;s business wasn&#x27;t materially impacted   when Twitter  launched their free app . I think this is a  good analogy of our position.",1433905990

Seeing as how this is an LEO constellation and not GEO one, and that internet requires bidirectional communication instead of a pure receiver they&#x27;ll be more complicated and expensive than satellite TV for sure. I just don&#x27;t know enough about the current hardware to know if it&#x27;s within reach of the average consumer.<p>(BTW, I find it likely that even if the ground stations ate cheap enough to be privately owned, they&#x27;ll be more like a cable modem than an 802.11 chip - a relatively expensive stationary piece of equipment that you hook up to an 802.{3/11} network in the home.",1433905519

I know there is tons of code to read, and absent of further guidance I should just dive in and get started. But in the interest of learning:
How do you find &quot;good&quot; code to read? How interactive should the reading be? Are there ways to find a progression of stuff to read - simple to complex? Know of any &quot;reading lists&quot; to follow, maybe even a code-reading curricular plan?
Thanks in advance.",1433905262
