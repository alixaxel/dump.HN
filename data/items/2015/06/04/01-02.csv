Buying and renting are easily substitutable strategies and thus by basic economics the prices are equivalent except in speculative bubbles (renting is cheaper) and in panic crashes (buying is cheaper). Since the prices are generally equivalent it makes sense to buy a house if one would prefer to not be subject to landlord-externalities and/or if one would prefer to own one&#x27;s housing outright 30 years in the future, when retirement looms.<p>None of this has anything to do with student loan debts.

9656969,comment,9647929,9653821,0,0,vidarh,,,"How is that relevant? That coal plants deaths are spread over the entire world does not make them less lethal.<p>The deaths caused by Chernobyl is a tiny blip compared to coal no matter whose estimates you pick.<p>In 2010 alone, estimated deaths from US coal power plants alone was 13,000, with a huge number of other bad health effect (20,000 heart attacks for example) [1]<p>In the 3 decades from Chernobyl we can extrapolate to maybe ~350k-400k deaths from US coal plants alone.<p>The number of deaths due to Chernobyl on the other hand, is rarely estimated higher than the low tens of thousands. The number of cancer incidents attributable to Chernobyl is likely far higher. E.g. estimates of an excess 7k thyroid cancer incidents in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia by 2005. But only a small number of those have died of cancer so far (the number <i>will</i> likely increase, but the reduction in overall life expectancy is still modest).<p>In 2005, the UN predicted 4,000 deaths due to Chernobyl [2]. Greenpeace countered with a claim of up to ~300k deaths total[3] (based on a combination of an estimated 93k deaths in Belarus and 60k deaths in Russia due to cancers, and an additional estimate of potentially another 140k premature deaths in the following/coming years).<p>Even if we accepts the Greenpeace claims, as the upper boundary, more people have likely died due to US coal plants alone than due to Chernobyl in the years since Chernobyl.<p>And the US is not the biggest consumer of coal. Already well before 2000, China had surpassed US coal consumption. Tack on India and Russia, and the US coal consumption is only 1/3 of that used by the top 4 countries. Go to the top 10, and the US coal consumption made up ~25% by 2000, and as far as I know <i>dropping</i> as a percentage of overall consumption due to dramatic continued growth in places like China. So even just looking at the top 10, it would not be unreasonable to quadruple the estimates of excess deaths from coal from the above to 1.4-1.6 million in the 3 decades from Chernobyl.<p>But of course these plants were going for decades before that, and will continue for decades to come, and many of these countries have far more lax rules than the US when it comes to emissions. The reality is that worldwide deaths from coal likely are equivalent to <i>Greenpeace&#x27;s</i> idea of Chernobyl every 2-5 years.  On the other hand, if the UN predictions are right, <i>US</i> plants alone are as lethal as 3 Chernobyl&#x27;s every year, and coal worldwide is equivalent to somewhere well above 12 Chernobyl&#x27;s every year.<p>Now, it is reasonable to bring up that Chernobyl is only one plant, but the point is the difference is damage scenarios: Nuclear plants kill when something goes wrong, and something goes wrong exceedingly rarely, leaving us able to name the ones attributable to 90%+ of nuclear power related deaths.<p>Coal plants, on the other hand, silently kills every day, around the clock, during normal operation. Chernobyl, even accepting the worst case estimates, does not lift nuclear even into the same league. Even if we replaced coal with Chernobyl type reactors, with the same lax safety procedures as at Chernobyl, rather than opt for the much safer designs and processes that were the norm even back in 1986, we&#x27;d still kill far fewer people.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.rmi.org/RFGraph-health_effects_from_US_power_plant_emissions"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rmi.org/RFGraph-health_effects_from_US_power_plan...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2013/04/chernobyl_death_toll_how_many_cancer_cases_are_caused_by_low_level_radiation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/explainer/2...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/chernobyl-deaths-180406/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/che...</a>",1433382251

All spy agencies conduct activities which are clearly illegal under the laws of their target countries. But are these activities always &quot;wrong?&quot; Conversely, spy agencies may conduct activities which are legal under their own laws, but are morally wrong -- harassment of MLK, for example.<p>And &quot;unambiguously legal&quot; is overselling the point: PPD-20 includes offensive capabilities amounting to acts of war -- which would presumably be illegal absent congressional approval. China surveillance includes illegal surveillance of US nationals and well as mass surveillance, which is arguably inappropriate policy. Tempora is a program conducted by the UK -- arguably illegal as signatory to EU treaty. Spying on Germany is likely to support economic espionage, which would be illegal under WTO treaty, etc. Al Jezeera is a journalist organization, which provides a useful Arab propaganda counterpoint to US propaganda, and is not itself a sponsor or advocate of terrorism. The various spying methods exposed are executive overviews and lack sufficient technical detail for implementation, and are thus appropriate for public policy discussion.<p>The US state security apparatus is also not elected -- yet it clearly does control policy through overclassification and outright misrepresentation of its activities to congressional oversight.<p>Were Mr. Snowden&#x27;s actions illegal? Yes, clearly, but that is a question of no meaningful value in this context, as most NSA activity is illegal somewhere, and some NSA and FBI activity is clearly illegal within the US.<p>Were these actions wrong? That remains to be seen.<p>Even if they were wrong, is there a net moral benefit which could excuse the costs? That is a complicated question. Do the fruits of NSA, CIA and FBI espionage achieve their stated goals? Is US foreign policy successful? Does the US reliably achieve its military objectives?<p>So, rather than yet again repeating the mistakes made over the last 100 years -- with some exceptions, an otherwise disgraceful litany of paranoia and short-sighted pragmatism -- perhaps it is a good time to reexamine politically whether foreign policy as practiced by the US is appropriate and efficacious. The responsibility for this interminable chain of dismal failures must be accepted by the US government and US electorate as a whole. The status quo -- mindless subservience to nationalism, patriotism, and religion along with a generous dose of political amnesia -- is completely unjustified at this point.<p>This discussion cannot ever fully occur when the mechanisms informing that foreign policy are forever hidden from political debate by a veil of overclassification motivated by criminal activity.<p>Mr. Snowden has caused that debate to begin -- his stated intent. One could therefore reasonably conclude his actions are moral and justified as well as illegal under US law. US law is therefore the problem, not Mr. Snowden.",1433381930
