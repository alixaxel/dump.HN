Con 2: They focus on not requiring sync, and concessions were made for this (a bunch of defaults, as well as con 1 from above) when they really actually do require sync. The password counter and password type (strong, weak, etc) both need to be synced to actually derive a password.<p>If we&#x27;re going to have to sync these to reliably store our passwords, then why not just go with an actual password manager without any of these arbitrary limitations?<p>I&#x27;ve been using 1Password and its been working out great for me.

9789423,comment,9788253,9789350,0,0,nrinaudo,,,"While this is true, I find the meta tag to be a horrible pain in the ass.<p>If you have to parse some HTML that you get over an HTTP connection - you&#x27;re writing a crawler, say, or you want to extract RDFa metadata, you have to deal with the following, surprisingly common case: both the header and the html document contain encoding information, and they disagree. The RFC states that you should trust the header, but in practice, that&#x27;s certainly not always the case - nor even, in my experience, is it the case the majority of the time.<p>If you decide to use the meta tag, that means that you have already strarted decoding your byte stream, get the encoding, then need to re-interpret the bytes you&#x27;ve already read. I have seen a lot of pages that declared their encoding <i>after</i> the title tag.<p>What&#x27;s worse, you can&#x27;t know whether you have a meta tag until you&#x27;ve parsed the whole head, which can be huge with hundreds of kilobytes of inlined javascript and css.<p>The argument that you should just read the first 1024 bytes and assume utf-8 if nothing is found is just not satisfactory - I want the encoding of the documents I&#x27;m parsing to be correct all the time, not when the remote host follows the rules. If I&#x27;m writing a crawler, the remote host cares nothing about my needs and I&#x27;m the one suffering from my unwilingness to be flexible.<p>So, yeah. Don&#x27;t use the meta encoding tag, and trust your user agent to save the html code in a sane (utf-8) encoding. There is no reason to store encoding information in an html file, just like I doubt your source code always starts with a preprocessor instruction declaring the encoding that the compiler should use.",1435391123

9789390,comment,9776263,9782711,0,0,pdkl95,,,"(apologies for the late reply)<p>You <i>really</i> shouldn&#x27;t ever run under the C locale unless your need to support older (pre-locale/unicode) software or data of the same vintage. Doing so defeats the entire purpose.<p>You&#x27;re confusing issues here: locale support lets you parse text. Your &quot;file&quot; example is not relevant, and would be part of something like gettext(3). Yes, gettext can be configured <i>from</i> the locale, but that is a separate feature from what I was talking about.<p>The locale support is how you automatically handle lexing the input stream, which is why I brought up the character classes that, unfortunately, most people seem to ignore, resulting in broken text support.<p>If you properly support locales, you program will support the user with LC_ALL=&quot;fr_FR.utf8&quot; typing their floats as 3,14 automatically.<p>The fact that your program expect a <i>field name</i> to be &#x27;file&#x27; is unrelated, but is something the user could learn by 1) reading your man page, 2) reading your <i>text output</i> and copying it (if appropriate), or 3) reading your error messages that you should be generating when you see &#x27;fichier=&quot;foo.txt&quot;&#x27; when you were expecting &#x27;file=&quot;foo.txt&quot;&#x27;. Note: if you used [:alpha:] to lex the input, you would automatically be able to <i>extract</i> the incorrect word for your error message when a user in LC_CTYPE=&quot;jp_JP&quot; enters &#x27;ファイル=&quot;foo.txt&quot;&#x27;.<p>I believe the problem here is related to a confusion of <i>lexing</i> with <i>parsing</i>. The various locale features solve the lexing problem, but you still have a parsing problem no matter the syntax of how the data is serialized. You have to check that /[[:alpha:]]+/ was &#x27;file&#x27; not &#x27;fichier&#x27; or &#x27;ファイル&#x27;, just the same as you would have to check the output of your XML parser that the <file> tag was not <fichier> or <ファイル>, just the same as you would have to check that a binary field was 0x0003 or whatever the flag value was.<p>You may be looking for a way to automatically discover the <i>semantics</i> (schema) that another program expect - and that would be a nice feature - but that is generally orthogonal to the  <i>syntax</i> used for IPC. (must like how XML can be converted to YAML/JSON/BSON/etc). It is also a far more complicated feature, and I&#x27;m not sure it can ever really be <i>solved</i> (halting problem, possibly), but maybe a &quot;good enough&quot; solution could be created.",1435389896

9789371,comment,9788088,9789326,0,0,adrusi,,,"<i>Perl suffers from having too many magical operators that makes it hard to reason about a snippet of code.</i><p>Certainly a matter of personal preference, but a sprinkling of operators isn&#x27;t so bad once you&#x27;re acquainted with the language. Yes it&#x27;s possible to weave a mess in perl, but most of the time you&#x27;re just dealing with code that might have a few sigils preceeding an identifier, not ASCII soup.<p>I&#x27;d say the real issue is weak typing (implicit conversions between primitives, using strings for many things where some more specialized data type would have been more appropriate) and variable scope problems. These can lead to hard to locate bugs. Worse is the culture in the perl community of manipulating the VM&#x27;s internals and generating code at runtime and all kinds of other extremely dynamic behaviors. It&#x27;s amazing what perl lets you accomplish there, but when some package you got off CPAN does something weird and then something goes wrong, it can get really weird.<p><i>Recently I learned that Javascript doesn&#x27;t handle modulus on a negative number correctly among other things.</i><p>That&#x27;s not really true. Javascript doesn&#x27;t have a modulus operator, it has a remainder operator, and it is completely valid as a remainder operator. The &quot;%&quot; operator is usually called the modulus operator, but it originated in C where prior to C99 its behavior on signed integers was undefined, and on signed integers modulo and remainder are equivalent. So javascript didn&#x27;t want undefined behavior so they picked one definition and ran with it, it just so happens that C99 chose the other definition and it stuck.",1435389138

That&#x27;s plenty to encode all existing, pre-historian and future characters mankind knows about. There&#x27;s even an unofficial section for Klingon. Indeed, Unicode is big enough to allow for unofficial, private-use areas.</i><p>The private use areas only encode about 137,000 codepoints (U+e000 to U+f8ff & U+f0000 to U+10ffff) and are running out quickly. Most of U+e000 to U+f8ff is used by many different private agreements, and some pseudo-public ones like the Conscript registry which encodes Klingon, linked to in the article. Conscript also uses a large chunk of plane F to encode the constructed script <i>Kinya</i>, i.e. the 3696 codepoints in U+f0000 to U+f0e6f, see <a href=""http://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/charts/PDF/UF0000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kreativekorp.com/ucsur/charts/PDF/UF0000.pdf</a> . It takes up so much room because it&#x27;s a block script like Korean Hangul and is encoded by formula just like Hangul. Each Korean Hangul block is made up of 2 or 3 jamo: one of 19 leading consonants, one of 21 vowels, and optionally one of 27 trailing consonants, giving a total of 19 * 21 * 28 = 11,172 possible syllable blocks, generated by formula into range U+ac00 to U+d7a3. Kinya also uses such a formula to generate its script, and I&#x27;m sure many other constructed block scripts will make their way into the quasi-official Conscript Registry. I&#x27;m even working on one of my own.<p>In fact, rather than filling up U+f0000 to U+10ffff, such conscripts only need to fill up the first quarter of it (i.e. U+f0000 to U+f7fff) for Unicode to run out of private use space, because the remainder (U+f8000 to U+10ffff) is needed for a second-tier surrogate system (see <a href=""https://github.com/gavingroovygrover/utf88"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gavingroovygrover/utf88</a> ) to extend the codepoint space back up to 1 billionish codepoints as it was originally specified by Pike and Thompson until it was clipped back down to 1 million in 2003.<p>So Unicode is not &quot;plenty to encode&quot; or &quot;big enough to allow for&quot; all known, future, or private-use characters.",1435388510
