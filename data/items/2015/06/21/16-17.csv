Is this question actually &quot;What happens if you cross the event horizon of a black hole?&quot;  BH&#x27;s aren&#x27;t discrete things, right, the gravity of them (at least outside the EH?) is a continuum, no?  Which would mean, pedantically, that we are already &quot;IN&quot; all the BH&#x27;s now, just too far away to care.<p>Also, I find this &#x27;stretching&#x27; argument a bit mind bending.  Do we think this REALLY happens?  If the gravity delta between my feet and head (assuming I&#x27;m heading in feet first, and if Ender&#x27;s Game has taught us anything, why wouldn&#x27;t you?) is so great, wouldn&#x27;t I just get literally ripped apart?  I&#x27;m not actually made of a stretchable material.  Or is the gravity stretching the SPACE I&#x27;m in and I&#x27;m going with it and wouldn&#x27;t notice?<p>Lastly - Hawking Radiation.  I understand, probably incorrectly, that this is a manifestation of quantum fluctuations happening RIGHT AT the EH, and one particle flies inside the EH goes in, and the anti-particle outside the EH doesn&#x27;t then get annihilated by it, and escapes, leading to an apparent radiative effect.  If this is the case, why does the ANTI-particle always have to be the one that escapes?  Why not the opposite?  My question here is, wouldn&#x27;t the particle/antiparticles that get split happen in equal amounts for a net zero radiative effect?",1434905951

Apple&#x27;s move is to cut record labels massive control grip on the market, not to rip off the artist. Taylor Swift is in a very unique positions to have a very lucrative record deal with her label. Most artists don&#x27;t, that&#x27;s why you are hearing from her and not others.<p>It was the same situation with Metallica and Napster. They got the majority of the money from their record sales. Most artists are just interested in the massive distribution these platforms offer, so when a relatively small act shows up in your town you might have heard of them. The live show is were most acts make any money anyway.<p>Many years ago, I recorded a number of albums with different bands. On average, for every $10 album sold, I would get 10 cents, paid to me after the label recoups costs. When you aren&#x27;t Taylor Swift, that is the deal most artist are offered through a record label.",1434905878

Chris knows this. I had discussions with him (many many years ago, before he ever started at Apple) about GCC&#x27;s register allocation approach vs what he was thinking of doing for LLVM.<p>There are actually only so many good approaches to spill code /rematerialization/live range splitting you can use.

Whether we like it or not, we&#x27;re quickly shifting into a world where art is only viable as a labor of love. Everything being digital means copying is free. Scarcity has gone out the window. Now if only our increased productivity and automations led to lesser and lesser working hours, we&#x27;d all have a lot more time for artistic endeavors on the side.<p>But yes, it&#x27;s becoming increasingly difficult to sustain yourself solely as an artist. Life isn&#x27;t fair, unfortunately.<p>Would the world be better if we had purely gratis art? I don&#x27;t know ... the production values would certainly be a lot lower.

9754052,comment,9670802,9712044,0,0,nmrm2,,,"No, that is not my entire argument. (However, ASIDE: when every advanced nation disagrees with your view on morality or pragmatism, it does not mean you a wrong, but it does mean you should closely examine your line of reasoning for both pragmatism and consistency with reasonable and well-grounded moral standards. Of course the democratic consensus of all of these countries can be wrong, but it&#x27;s worth taking pause. That&#x27;s all. END ASIDE.)<p>Here is the argument that I have been expressing in various forms and you don&#x27;t seem to understand or provide cogent counter-points to:<p>PRAGMATIC CLAIM: Employers are allowed to &quot;discriminate&quot;/select based upon <i>non-intrinsic signals of</i> characteristics relevant to the job at hand.<p>WARRANT: This is necessary for society/businesses to function because otherwise, it would be prohibitively expensive to hire people using anything other than coin-flips.<p>MORAL STANDARD I: In order to use a signal as the basis for a hiring decision it should be both a) non-intrinsic, and b) signal something relevant to the task at hand.<p>EDUCATION MEETS THIS MORAL STANDARD:<p>a) CLAIM: Education is non-intrinsic<p>WARRANT: It is something you seek out and work to earn, not something you are born with. (The issue of ensuring universal access is entirely separable (and something I support, btw).)<p>b) CLAIM: Education signals something relevant to the task at hand<p>WARRANT 1: Technical background is assured through testing in relevant coursework -- testing that you would have to (at great and impractical expense to the business) reproduce in order to make informed hiring decisions.<p>WARRANT 2: Education can also serve as a signal of necessary problem solving ability, communication skills, etc.<p>MORAL STANDARD II: Any moral constraints placed on the set of available signals should not make it prohibitively expensive for business to function.<p>EDUCATION MEETS MORAL STANDARD II: Because it&#x27;s a cheap signal to use as an initial filter.<p>BANNING THE USE OF EDUCATION WOULD FAIL TO MEET MORAL STANDARD II: It would require companies to essentially require a comprehensive examination that is well-proctored etc, which is a pretty huge burden for the company and -- besides -- basically would amount to credentialing anyways because any reasonable firm would outsource this.<p>Other relevant claims:<p>CONSISTENCY CLAIM: There exist signals that meet both standards.<p>WARRANT: Education can be used to select a small number of applicants, and the cost for choosing among those should be marginal wrt the value-added by the employee.<p>CLAIM: These moral standards preclude the use of race/sex/age discrimination.<p>WARRANT: these are all intrinsic features that are explicitly forbidden",1434905658

In his view (from what I remember; my recollection could be somewhat incorrect) most of the classical academic research on it is solving the wrong problem. Most formulations of register allocation are graph coloring algorithms designed to answer the question &quot;is this function colorable using K registers without spilling?&quot; The algorithms for handling the case when you <i>do</i> spill usually don&#x27;t have as much thought put into them. But this is emphasizing the wrong aspect of the problem in practice; for almost any interesting function on the commonly used architectures (x86/ARM), the answer to the theoretical question is trivially &quot;no&quot; (because there are relatively few registers), and the most important practical problem is how to spill effectively (including deciding whether to spill versus split versus rematerialize, etc.) As I understand it, that&#x27;s the idea behind LLVM&#x27;s (relatively) new greedy allocator [1]: the graph-coloring part of the problem is simple, and the focus is on spilling and splitting, problems that the classical academic literature has tended to put less emphasis on.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://blog.llvm.org/2011/09/greedy-register-allocation-in-llvm-30.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.llvm.org/2011/09/greedy-register-allocation-in-l...</a>",1434904955

9754007,comment,9750808,9753861,0,0,pron,,,"> But some languages are so different that they change the way you think about programming, and those new ways of thinking improve your skill in every language.<p>I absolutely agree -- I never said that learning new languages is useless -- it&#x27;s just that there are other things you can learn that are much (<i>much</i>) more useful.<p>For example, decent familiarity with various algorithms and data structures (the more the better), OS architecture and hardware architecture will also improve your skill in every language, and will do so to a much greater extent than knowing Lisp, Haskell, Prolog and Python. The reason is that different programming languages differ in the abstractions they provide and the way they&#x27;re used to express algorithms. But abstractions -- while very important -- are secondary to the algorithms themselves.<p>I&#x27;m saying this from the vantage point of roughly 20 years of experience, after having learned (to varying degrees) Lisp, Haskell and Prolog. Yes, they help. But knowing that other stuff helps so much more.<p>I find that it is younger programmers who tend to equate a program with its code, while more experienced programmers learn to separate the two: the code (which is very important), and the program itself -- the stream of machine instructions that get executed on the CPU and its interaction with other hardware subsystems and the OS. Today I can get a very good feel for what a program does -- and how elegantly it does it -- without even looking at the code or knowing what language it&#x27;s written in, but simply by running it in a profiler (or several), although the profiler should be appropriate for the language. I find that &quot;profile elegance&quot; is even more important than &quot;code elegance&quot;.<p>Code elegance is sometimes subjective and is almost always language dependent. Often, migrating abstraction concepts from one language to another really hurts code elegance; chief among those offending imported concepts is the monad, which has much better alternatives in imperative languages -- in fact, I&#x27;m giving a talk precisely about that in the upcoming Curry On/ECOOP conference in a couple of weeks.",1434904788

The way people are talking about it, it doesn&#x27;t really come off that way.<p>Sometimes I wonder if SOPA would have gone through and achieved the purposes it was set out to do - yes, let&#x27;s be ideological for a moment and talk about the purpose vs the potential abuse.  A lot of websites that harbor piracy are no now no longer available, and it&#x27;s way more difficult to pirate your favorite music.  What would that world be like, for consumers and artists?<p>Maybe more artists would pull their music from the streaming services, which were formed to fight piracy.  Now all of a sudden that 9.95 per month you pay for music isn&#x27;t so great, because not everyone is on there.  The streaming services were built as an alternative to a crime - piracy.<p>To me the end result would be simple:  The average user would have to pay more for their content, and that money would flow more into artists pockets, and those who work in artistic industries, which would reinforce more and better artistic creation.<p>I am probably one of the few:  I pay for all of my content, and not on streaming services.  I don&#x27;t buy singles, I buy the whole album.  When a friend opens a business, I don&#x27;t immediately ask for a deal.  I go in, and pay full price, and try to support that friend as best as I can.  I may be old school - I pay for things, I am happy to pay for things.  I want to financially support people who create things, because I want more people to have a means to be able to go out, create, and be rewarded for their work.",1434904065

UMG probably negotiated an even higher advance in exchange for permission to launch the 3 month free campaign.  UMG / BMLG should be sharing this advance payment with their artists.  Taylor knows this so a good question to ask is:  What % of the advance is Taylor receiving?  The answer is probably none because most artists receive nothing from these advance payments.  Even the hugely successful ones.  So why is Taylor writing this letter?  She is extremely smart and has a brilliant team of advisors around her so she knows about the advance that Apple already paid UMG.

The lead developers used git and IRC chat a lot. After being hired my friend began to test a new product they were working on and submitted some changes to github, they accepted the pull request and my friend submitted a few more finding all sorts of bugs. At this point the lead developers started to argue about how the changes were unnecessary and that my friend needed to learn more about how their product worked, what was rude is that they were publicly arguing while leaving him out of the conversation. No words directed at him, just conversation <i>about</i> him. A few weeks later they realized their project really did have a lot of bugs and pushed through a large change with many of my friends bug-fixes in it without giving him credit or even so much as a thank you.<p>The lead devs would pal around and make inside jokes and ask my friend to do all sorts of work while leaving him &quot;out of the loop&quot; as if he were some &quot;lackey&quot; for them to boss around and not really part of the team.<p>Not too long after he started working there the team told him he needed to attend a &quot;conference on sensitivity in OSS&quot; halfway across the country.

And while others have questioned your tactics during the job posting phase, I&#x27;m willing to bet you&#x27;ve put as little thought into the phase before that as well. Are you blogging, speaking at conferences and meet ups or putting out open source projects? You need to be putting significant effort into making your engineering brand mean something to the candidates you&#x27;re trying to reach so that in the brief moment when they&#x27;re deciding whether to send you their resume, you&#x27;ve given them some reason to believe that you&#x27;re an above average place to work.<p>It amazes me that in a field that preaches understanding the customer to build a product that resonates, we haven&#x27;t bothered to look at the hiring process the same way. And it should be even easier to do considering our target market is made up of people very similar to ourselves. When I started hiring, I didn&#x27;t have much success until I started to look at what type of ads resonated with me and the ways that I went about looking for work. I spent weeks going through job postings collecting ones that I felt I&#x27;d apply to if I didn&#x27;t have a job and then started to look for themes.<p>One theme I found was that they didn&#x27;t follow the 3-part format with a description of the company, description of the skills desired and description of the likely tasks of the position. And not one of them included the bit about &quot;working closely with the product manager&quot;...there&#x27;s no surer sign of uninteresting work than that cliché.<p>But biggest theme I found was that I had heard of and formed a positive impression about the companies posting the ads I was interested in. A good example of a relatively small company that I feel has done a good job with this is Segment.io. They&#x27;ve discussed their transition from primarily NodeJS to Go very publicly as well as a few other technical topics which led me to investigate their Github repository a few months before. So when I saw one of their ads, it immediately registered as one I would have applied to if I needed work.<p>And lastly, I realized that I haven&#x27;t found a job from a job posting in over a decade. It&#x27;s really a pretty crappy way to connect with employers. Every job I&#x27;ve gotten since the downturn has been the result of either a referral from a former coworker or a pre-existing connection that I&#x27;ve made with others from the technical community. I realized during the downturn that if something like that happened again, I wanted to be prepared, so I started building connections that I could reach out to to find work. Those connections are such a better way to find work since it&#x27;s essentially like sending a proxy you trust through the interview process to weed out the companies that aren&#x27;t worth working for. And those connections are also a great way to bring find great people to bring into any work quality work environment.<p>Hiring is hard for people who aren&#x27;t willing to put in the effort or want to see it as a process that you only put effort into during the hiring phase. It gets significantly easier when you view it as a continual process to position yourself (or, more accurately, whoever is your employer at the time) as an appealing place for your ideal candidates to work. Put yourself in their shoes and design your hiring process in the customer-centric process you&#x27;re probably already using for your actual produce and you&#x27;ll be a lot more successful.",1434903694

A massive campaign was waged to get society to buy into the concepts that growth (not sustainability) is needed, and that productivity is important. This also coincided with the growth of consumerism, as people started thinking they needed more stuff.",1434903165

In short, the MediaWiki software gave power to the initial users of the software, who were mainly men. As the site grew, the software was not updated to devolve power to other groups, such as women and minorities, in part because the dominant group thought they were/are doing good work. In Wikipedia might is right and the end justifies the means. It&#x27;s not just women, men find themselves routinely harassed on Wikipedia, and that&#x27;s IMHO a fault of software, that doesn&#x27;t have enough checks and balances on its various power structures. I came to realize this empirically because my site, which also crowdsources news and biographies, has up to 80% female participation.
