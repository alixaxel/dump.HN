For that, you had to license J2ME from Sun under different conditions. If you ever had the misfortune of targeting J2ME, you&#x27;d know why it was a no-brainer for Google. I shudder to imagine writing Android apps using J2ME.<p>It is prudent to note that Google didn&#x27;t write its own implementation from scratch: they took advantage of Apache Harmony (by erstwhile Sun frenemy: IBM).

They are responding to advocacy of a course of inaction (not developing taxi apps). The comment thus has some value, even if you disagree with it&#x27;s conclusion.\n2) You are advocating banning people for saying things. This puts a burden on you to make the case for why they should be banned. You don&#x27;t explain anything about what was so bad about the comment, but simply insist that it must be obvious by inspection.\n3) You assert that anyone who isn&#x27;t offended by the comment is &quot;fucking blind&quot; and not &quot;an essentially decent human being&quot;.

If the tanks were &#x27;unzipped&#x27; quickly enough, the fuel and oxygen might not have had time to mix to a stoichiometric ratio that supported combustion.<p>Looking back at a gif of the incident, there was a pretty impressive amount of fire. Initially when the oxygen hit the first stage exhaust, causing the unburnt RP1 to burn (all the &#x27;extra&#x27; flame that appears in the exhaust plume), and then there is a fair amount of fire at the front of the vehicle a second or two later (I assume the second stage RP1 tank failed at that point).

Yes, it has held true regardless of which country or where I biked, regardless of complexity of the intersection or how crowded the area was with other cyclists and pedestrians. Your immediate side needs to be vacant and you need to have a general awareness of your surroundings (which is irrelevant to your speed, you should have a general awareness of your surrounding whether you are going 5km or 20km).<p>You brought up pedestrians and &quot;more complex intersections than canyon roads&quot;. I brought up examples of streets I&#x27;ve cycled on that weren&#x27;t a canyon road and were <i>packed</i> with pedestrians.<p>You mentioned that (1) I had never learned how to bike and (2) That town/city intersections greatly differ from canyon roads.<p>I demonstrated (1) to be false and asserted that I continue to bike to this day. My mental model of what it is like to stop is still fresh, not 10 years outdated. My argument is that (2) is false, the <i>only difference</i> between the two is the <i>acceptable safe speed of travel</i>; hence the speed limit reference.<p>Braking (and the &quot;difficulty of doing so&quot; being even a &quot;slight <i>problem</i>&quot;) is bullshit. That&#x27;s my assertion after nearly two decades of biking. It&#x27;s a slight <i>inconvenience</i> that the cyclist should respect laws that are in place <i>to prevent them from being hit by a car</i> or prevent them plowing into a pedestrian/other cyclist. But <i>because of laziness or entitlement</i> they choose to <i>ignore these laws</i> and don&#x27;t brake where and when they should.<p>There is a reason why cyclists are perceived as &quot;entitled pricks&quot;. It&#x27;s because, as a whole, they generally act <i>like entitled pricks</i> and then try to explain away why they act so entitled.<p>I&#x27;ve approached intersections where a pedestrian can walk in front of me from behind a bush. I exercise caution and slow my speed as I approach; such that in the event a pedestrians walks in front of me at the last moment I can brake in time to avoid hitting them. I&#x27;ve had to bike on a single-width bi-directional street where I have to avoid cars turning in blind T-intersections and avoid getting in the way of other pedestrians and cyclists. Intersections where my only knowledge of upcoming potential hazards comes from an intersection mirror [0] 15 meters ahead.<p>None of these scenarios change the difficult of coming to a safe and complete stop when exercising one&#x27;s best judgement to maintain a reasonable and safe speed. If one isn&#x27;t going &quot;120 in the 40&quot; there is no reason why they cannot come to a safe and complete stop.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.thejapanfaq.com/mirror.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thejapanfaq.com/mirror.jpg</a>",1435620507

I can almost guarantee you that Apple will at some point (possibly later this year?) include an NFC chip in the iPad line-up with a new app that will allow you to receive payment with Apple ID.  Also the fact that they are making an Android application for Apple Music leads me to believe they will support Google Wallet or any NFC payment method as well.",1435619049

It also shows that the engineers who implemented Google&#x27;s project had been tainted by exposure to Java.<p>I think that&#x27;s one of the key points. How can you claim a clean-room implementation, when there are (small) portions that have been directly copied? It weakens the case for the rest of the code.",1435618980

But when you take a broader view than the latter half of the 20th century, most of the technological progress that <i>actually made our lives better</i> were the results of targeted effort: wastewater treatment, antibiotics, essentially all medications. We didn&#x27;t get to these things accidentally.<p>Maybe those technologies were <i>expensive</i> at first and came down in price with adoption, but that&#x27;s <i>different</i> than making the claim that if we just work on <i>whatever rich people want today</i>, we&#x27;ll automatically get to places that are beneficial for society. Want to help the third-world feed itself? Perhaps you should invest your resources <i>in that</i>, not in a silicon valley nutri-shake startup.<p>Hell, most of <i>your</i> examples are cases where the military did something to solve a <i>known problem</i> that was too expensive (or too speculative) to be left to private industry. How you turn that into an argument that our best-and-brightest should be working on ad-optimization eludes me.<p>This industry, I swear: we whine about the loss of space exploration, and wonder what happened to our flying cars, but we brush off criticisms when someone invests millions of dollars in the sixty-seventh niche food-delivery service for the SF bay area.

In fact the kind of smart grid that would be needed to deal with such widely varying local loads would almost certainly be more expensive than just maintaining what we&#x27;ve got.<p>It&#x27;s worth remembering that electric generation started out as a very local and independent thing.
