A serving of oats as indicated by the packaging is 3/4 cups or 65.7g of oats by weight.  That works out to a whopping $0.1647 per serving.  Prices are fairly average if not a little higher where I live so yes most people can get oats for $0.20 a serving.  The secret is probably not buying at whole foods.<p>Honey can be a bit more expensive, for me it&#x27;s about $0.012 per gram when not on sale.  I use around a tablespoon in the morning so that&#x27;s about 21.25g by weight which gives $0.255 in cost.  Once again, that&#x27;s hardly unmanageable on a daily basis.

9670776,comment,9670359,9670593,0,0,briandear,,,"Compound interest? Where? The interest rates are such that inflation would destroy whatever gain you have. Nearly all savings accounts are paying an annual yield of less than 1%! That means WITH compounding, you&#x27;re looking at a 1% or lower gain. Inflation is typically between 1-4%, with 2% being the benchmark in terms of financial planning, though admittedly in April, we had slightly negative inflation, but that trend won&#x27;t continue.<p>Investing is the only way to build wealth. It&#x27;s impossible to save your way to financial freedom. If you make an average of $100K per year from age 30-60, that&#x27;s $3 million in income. Assuming about 35% in state, local and federal taxes, that leaves you with $65K per year. Now, you&#x27;re saving 10% of that per year, that&#x27;s $6,500 saved per year. With a 1% rate, at the end of 30 years, you have about $229K. Assuming you live to be 80, that&#x27;s $229K that needs to earn enough to pay your bills. Even if you saved 20%, you&#x27;d still not even have $500K at the end of 30 years.<p>With the same 20% savings rate and some reasonably smart investing (12% returns,) then you&#x27;d end up with over $3.5 million over the same period. If that investing is in real estate, you could potentially earn that gain tax free (or tax reduced) because building depreciation percentages can generally exceed the &quot;profit&quot; from real estate cashflow. On top of that, a 1031 exchange means you can keep selling and trading up to larger and larger real estate without paying a capital gains tax, which means you build even more net worth that can then be leveraged to buy more properties. Most millionaires get there because of property, very, very rarely because they save their way to it. A typical middle-class wage doesn&#x27;t lend itself well to saving your way to millions. The math just doesn&#x27;t work, the tax code also doesn&#x27;t support it.<p>Frugality isn&#x27;t the key to success. The $30 you save by washing your own car is peanuts compared to the value of that time doing something more productive (like sourcing real estate or researching investments.) Frugality can actually cost you more money because of the time-value of money. But admittedly many of us have inherited our parents/grandparents&#x27; Depression Era, middle-class ethos.

If a runaway shopping cart dings it, I&#x27;d just shrug it off and buy another one and donate the imperfect one to my landscape gardener.<p>On the other hand, Elon Musk bought a $1 million Mclaren F1 after the 1999 zip2 sale netted him ~$20 million.  Like I said, everybody&#x27;s risk profile is different and most people including me do not think he&#x27;s fiscally irresponsible.<p>I think the nuance that&#x27;s getting lost in translation is my idea of &quot;affording&quot; to buy an exotic car.  Yes in mathematical terms, $10 million subtracting $300k leaves plenty left over so one can buy without requiring a loan and still be &quot;wealthy.&quot;<p>However, my idea of &quot;afford&quot; also <i>includes the state-of-mind</i> after one pays for it.  I&#x27;d like the luxury of not giving the super car no more thought than a Toyota Camry.  If I&#x27;m paranoid about the car, I can&#x27;t &quot;afford&quot; it no matter what my bank account says.  The car is ruling over me instead of the other way around.  The cost of ownership is too high (this includes &quot;mental costs&quot;).   The threshold isn&#x27;t &quot;<i>how much money I need to buy the car without a bank loan</i>&quot; but &quot;<i>how much money so that the car feels disposable.</i>&quot;",1433598293

Take for example, voting rights. When an offender completes his/her sentence they are expected to become contributing members of society and not recommit crimes. As part of this, common sense would say the individual should get a job and work hard at that job. So you expect an offender to get up go to work and pay taxes, but you don&#x27;t expect the offender to have a say in how those tax dollars are spent by being able to vote. There are also political motives for permanently stripping voting rights, but that is whole other conversation not suited for HN.<p>We live in a society where punishment for breaking the law becomes a moving goal post. Offenders are set up to fail in reentry in the US legal system, thus the high recidivism rates we experience. Fortunately there are many programs that are working to reverse this trend, but the fact of the matter is that until we stop moving the goal post on when the punishment ends the problem will never be 100% solved.",1433598174

CRISPR/Cas9 techniques do not give us anything we couldn&#x27;t do before--- after all there have been TALENs and zinc finger nucleases for quite a while. It just made the process of designing a new nuclease system much, much cheaper. However, no endonuclease driven system is going to be efficient at introducing mutations consistently. The basic problem is that these systems require the cooperation of the genomic repair systems of the cell. There are several ways which these repairs are mediated, and only one (homology directed repair) yields the desired outcome. That this happens at a low rate, and requires the introduction of DNA templates only diminishes the overall efficacy and multiplexity of the process.<p>Even when flooding cells with preassembled Cas9/gRNA complexes that are immediately active, the overall rate of homozygous introduction of the target mutation is in a few %. Knowing this, I find it hard to believe that CRISPR will be how we ultimately engage in high efficiency genome modification. It depends too much on the biology of the target system.

Presevent encourages political engagement and enables greater transparency in the American electoral process.<p>How does Presevent work?<p>Users of Presevent are shown the geographically closest upcoming events, so that users know when presidential candidates will be in their area. Presevent also lists the events&#x27; RSVP availability and cost of attendance. Users can add events directly to their iOS calendar, to remind them to attend the events they find most compelling.<p>How does Presevent change American politics?<p>With Presevent, users will have access to the information they need to hear the messages of Democratic and Republican presidential candidates across the United States.<p>Many presidential candidates purposefully limit the availability of information about their events to guarantee an audience of supporters, not curious voters. Additionally, media coverage of upcoming events often gives less precedence to candidates who lack large war chests, establishment endorsements, and other resources, which further compounds those candidates&#x27; disadvantages.<p>Presevent levels the playing field.

I would argue, in fact, that the field of book history owes a great deal TO digital humanities which exposed the nature of the book as a writing technology with unique textual affordances. A large amount of digital humanities work is centered on how to capture &quot;bookness&quot; in the digital realm including digital editions of just about any literary text, the Textual Encoding Initiative, etc.",1433595895

Multiple homes make sense for those who are frugal enough to restrict vacations mostly to the second home, which if well-located can appreciate in value faster than inflation. Frugal families often have such assets that appreciate, rather than expenses or possessions that depreciate.",1433595877

9670632,comment,9669166,9669754,0,0,kephra,,,"imho, starting a new language with Boehm GC is a very bad design choice. It means, that one just allocates memory, and does not care for managing it. Even worse, it prevent linking any library, e.g. a 2nd thread running Lua+C, that cares for its own memory, because Boehm GC runs over the complete memory, not only the one the language has to manage.<p>You basically need 3 types of memory: First for the objects in your language, 2nd for foreign light weight objects, where you only know a pointer, and 3rd for foreign heavy weight objects, that gets their memory from your GC.<p>> it uses stop-world<p>A fully concurrent GC is impossible, if variables are mutable. Regardless how tricky your GC delays the problem, there will come a point, where it has to stop all threads to collect the edge cases. This creates the GC dilemma, because currently only number of cores and amount of memory becomes cheaper, while single core performance stayed same for nearly 15 years.",1433595702

It makes it seem like some mind boggling amount of money but mathematically, it really isn&#x27;t that much.  A person classified as &quot;millionaire&quot; could be tagged that because of <i>total net assets</i> and not the <i>liquid cash</i> in a bank account.  E.g. a $500k house + $500k IRA/401k + $25k car is a &quot;millionaire&quot;.<p>But let&#x27;s say you have a <i>multi-</i>millionaire (e.g. 2 million dollars).  That might be $1 million in cash in the bank.  That&#x27;s still not much money because:<p>- it&#x27;s not enough to park $1 million of principal into risk-free US T-Bills and live off the current interest rates of < 1%.  That&#x27;s only $10k income per year which is less than minimum wage.<p>- if your child gets an expensive health problem like leukemia or spouse gets cancer, your medical bills could blow past the lifetime cap of the health insurance policy and therefore, you have to drain your savings to pay for expensive treatments.<p>- non-Ivy League schools can cost $50k per year.  If you have 2 children and you want to give them the gift of college education without being burdened with student debt, that&#x27;s at least $400k.  And to stay at $400k, it would require the parents to be &quot;cheapskates&quot; and not fund any extracurricular trips like ski vacations and Spring Break parties down in Mexico.<p>The millionaires that have less than $10 million definitely have to be &quot;frugal&quot; and watch their money.  Consider than NBA star Allen Iverson earned $200 million and blew it all away.<p>At $100+ million, one can start getting frivolous and maybe buy a Ferrari. However, $2 million is not enough cushion to live off interest income and be 100% worry-free from unexpected life events.  One would still have to work somewhere to keep adding to the nest egg.",1433595658
