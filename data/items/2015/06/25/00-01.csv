9775390,comment,9773263,9774129,0,0,dang,,,"In most cases, we unkill the thread so it stays open for comments, but do not turn off the rank penalty. Occasionally, though, we do turn it off. Some easy cases are when a good article has a bad title and people were flagging the title (solution: change the title and turn off flags), or when there is evidence of a flagging ring (solution: turn off flags and ignore future flags from the offenders).<p>The harder cases are posts like this one, where the community is divided on a political question, some want it on HN and others don&#x27;t. In that case we usually stop short of overriding the rank penalty. The voting and flagging systems have been in a stable equilibrium for years, and we&#x27;ve learned that it&#x27;s a mistake to fight that very much or very often.<p>But we do do it sometimes, I&#x27;d guess maybe 10% of the time (but haven&#x27;t looked at the data). For example, sometimes an article is so substantive and otherwise so obviously a good fit for HN that it doesn&#x27;t seem fair to the community to let the flags have their usual say. Sometimes a thread turns out to be unexpectedly high-quality and not a flamewar. And sometimes a story is of so much interest to the community that we couldn&#x27;t stop it even if we wanted to (a recent example being the Strange Loop/Yarvin thing), in which case we turn flagging off for hopefully the best submission on the topic and treat the others as dupes.<p>In the end, there&#x27;s no escaping editorial judgment, though not every HN user shares your positive view of it. We try not to over-exercise it, but never doing so would be suboptimal for the community. There&#x27;s a tragedy of the commons paradox in there somewhere.",1435193902

We just use it as a base filter and then build coaches into the most qualified people over time.<p>2) Some people need light changes, some people need harsh truth. Recruiters ignore the latter and treat them as lost causes. I don&#x27;t mean to say we&#x27;ll disrespect people -- sorry if it came across that way!<p>3) We&#x27;re building a network of helpful experts (see <a href=""https://jobstart.co/experts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobstart.co/experts</a>). We&#x27;ll give people tips on how to explore their own network, connect with our experts, and do generic things such as attend meetups/events. Depends on the coach and the candidate.<p>4) Hmm, I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to explain this part properly and it&#x27;s admittedly a bit difficult. Have you ever been sent a specced candidate by a company? What was that experience like -- good or bad? In our experience, it&#x27;s almost always been bad. Usually it&#x27;s so bad they don&#x27;t even get the position requirement and candidate aligned properly, let alone send an outstanding candidate. I think some of this comes back to point #1, having the engineer-coach understand the specs, and letting the candidate themselves even do some initial contact. We don&#x27;t run the entire job search for you -- we&#x27;ll intro you to some companies, sure, but we&#x27;re also going to teach you how to get better conversion % on your own efforts.<p>&quot;that acts and behaves the way a recruitment company is meant to behave&quot;. I disagree with everything in that sentence. Everything is temporary and no company or service is meant to act in any such way. Startups thrive only by finding creative ways of doing things.",1435193873

Iran has rapidly growing population from crazy unsustainable birthrates as part of the national policy of extreme oppression of women. California has and unsustainable mass immigration overwhelm its environment even as the native population wisely reduced birthrates to a sustainable level.<p>Most of the water is captured in reservoirs and diverted to agriculture.

It will run practically forever on every machine on which &quot;long long&quot; is 64 bits. It will likely terminate in finite time on a machine in which &quot;long long&quot; is 32 bit (there&#x27;s undefined C overflow behaviour, so it might never terminate). And it will do so with zero additional space.<p>A tail-call equivalent (the only kind of loop available in Scheme, for example) will -- without TCE/TCO -- overflow the stack on a 64-bit integer-or-more (e.g. Scheme&#x27;s arbitrary precision numbers) on every machine built so far. It will likely do the same even if ints are limited to 32 bit - although a machine with >16GB ram is likely to complete a 32 bit run with reasonably optimized language runtime and stack allocation scheme (neither of which is common - x64 ABI red zones would require >128GB just to do the 32 bit count with full stack frames).<p>If the int goes to 128 bit, all the memory chips ever produced in the world (and likely all those that will be produced in the next 20 years) would not be enough to stop this program from overflowing its stack - much unlike a TCE/TCO/C version.<p>In my opinion, something that switches between bounded and unbounded memory requirements should not be called &quot;optimization&quot;, but to I guess to each their own.",1435191494

This sentiment is nonsensical. Scientific funding often funds more than just salaries, and when it does fund salaries, those salaries are almost always modest. Furthermore, many of the salaries it funds are for non-scientists: technicians, software engineers, etc. The tired trope that scientific funding is primarily funnelled to wide-eyed loners who produce nothing but &quot;useless&quot; abstract ideas is demonstrably inaccurate. And to the extent that this caricature is accurate, Simons himself is a counter-point to the argument that this is a bad model.<p>2. This sentiment is impractical. Basic science is important to society as a whole and there&#x27;s almost always no way to become ultra-rich doing basic science(++). <i>All</i> of society benefits when a good lot of our best and brightest go into science (rather than e.g. consulting or finance). And the best way to ensure that great minds go into science is to ensure science remains funded so that it is possible to work on truly important problems.<p>3. This sentiment is intellectually bankrupt. A great mind following its dreams without prioritizing financial reward is responsible for most of the major scientific developments that make it possible for you to bash their would-be descendents from behind a keyboard.<p>4. This sentiment is morally bankrupt. Punishing passionate people who give up highly lucrative careers to do something that is good for humanity is nothing short of vindictive -- <i>I hate my work day so everyone else has to as well!</i><p>(edit: As an aside, you really think CEOs don&#x27;t like the rush from having lots of power and making important decisions? They may work long hours, but I guarantee most of them <i>fucking love</i> their jobs. I also bet there&#x27;s a pretty strong correlation between top-of-clas software engineers who command high salaries for their expertise, and software engineers who love their job.)<p>(edit2: Furthermore, science has lots of drudgery and hard, frustrating work to it; it&#x27;s not all sitting in an office and drinking coffee. The idea that scientists unequivocally work on fun problems all day and never bash their heads against the wall to solve problems that they&#x27;re more extrinsically than intrinsically motivated to work on is also pretty wrong.)<p>(++) Simons explicitly answers the question in his interview: No. Nothing we do at Renaissance -- no matter how impressive from a finance perspective -- is useful to science.
