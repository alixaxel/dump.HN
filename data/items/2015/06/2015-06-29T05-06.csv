OpenVPN has a significantly higher attack surface, especially if you consider things like XSRF on the Admin GUI. You&#x27;ll almost certainly need a hardened and updated OpenSSH in any case, so using a VPN can only possibly increase your attack surface.<p>My own opinion is if you have few enough servers and no other reason for a VPN, then expose SSH on a non-standard port or use a port knocker, and use something like this article&#x27;s MFA solution.<p>The non-standard port or port knocking is really just to keep spam out of your logs. Since authentication requires a 4096 bit private key, you&#x27;re not worried about brute force in any case.",1435557583

Now, in 2015, very few people would say that.<p>To be fair, I&#x27;m at least consistent in that I think human experimentation is prudent and should be done, precisely because I think it&#x27;s unethical to stall some of the research questions it would answer.<p>Of course, we actually /do/ human experimentation, including experimentation we&#x27;re not sure will work or which is not directly consented to by the human, moderated by the utility we get out of it and the risk to the human.<p>>  But still, it&#x27;s an issue of ends justifying the means.<p>What else is there to justify (or condemn) them?<p>We are but passing minds, waves cresting and breaking in a sea of chemicals. I view it as a duty to try and see as many healthy and happy minds as I can, and to be a net increase on that.<p>There simply is no reality except the one here, and our net impact on that all that matters. There&#x27;s no cosmic tally after about how good you meant to be.<p>So while it would break my heart to, I would push down the plunger to kill everyone one of my pet rats so I didn&#x27;t have to see so many skeletal faces in the children&#x27;s cancer ward anymore.<p>> I don&#x27;t know if humans have the right to effectively (metaphorically) cannibalize other species in order to improve our own, just because we&#x27;re more intelligent.<p>At the end of the day, my views are really the emotional, monsterous ones: I simply value human lives at over a million rats to a human, so I&#x27;m willing to kill billions of them a year on the alter of saving those children. Once I have that valuation, the rest is pretty easy deductions about what allows the advance of research in the biochemistry.<p>So I&#x27;m curious: do you not regard the people who die through your inaction to be your fault? and if they are your fault, how many human children is a rat worth?",1435557528

Shouldn&#x27;t they be being taken care of by the state anyways?<p>They are not actually communist; they are an authoritarian state controlling a capitalist economy. They started down that path in the late 1970s under Deng Xiaopeng.<p>Before that, the state did a very poor job caring for its citizens. Millions died of starvation, persecution, and other ills. Look up the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, two government programs, as examples.<p>After that, probably never in the history of humanity have so many in a time and place escaped poverty as those who have in China.

9796606,comment,9795085,9796433,0,0,modeless,,,"You&#x27;ve been able to port cell numbers to Google Voice for quite some time now, independent of Project Fi. It&#x27;s a $20 one-time fee. You get all your SMS, MMS, and voicemail messages in Hangouts, both on phone and desktop. Replying to SMS and reading transcribed voicemail on a desktop is quite nice. You can also make and receive voice calls from your number on desktop as well.<p>Since GV is a cloud service and independent of your phone, you can do all of these things from a desktop even if your phone has no service or a dead battery. For example, if you are overseas and you don&#x27;t have cell service you can use WiFi to send and receive calls and SMS, from your phone or your laptop, using your normal number. Of course you get all other Google Voice features like call recording, ringing multiple phones, sending specific numbers to voicemail, low international rates, etc.<p>You can also use Hangouts Dialer to make Google Voice calls over data from your phone, without using plan minutes. This is optional, but it has the advantage that you can use T-Mobile&#x27;s $30 unlimited data plan as an unlimited everything plan and potentially save a ton of money. Data service is not as reliable as native voice, but cutting your bill in half is pretty compelling.<p>Downsides are few. The big one used to be that MMS didn&#x27;t work, but it&#x27;s finally fixed. There may still be some oddities with group MMS in Hangouts. The Hangouts Android app kinda sucks, but there&#x27;s supposedly a redesign on the way. SMS happens over your data connection, which is less reliable in places with bad service like crowded stadiums. Porting your number will end your current carrier contract and you&#x27;ll have to start a new one if you want to continue using your cell phone; depending on your contract this may cause early termination fees and/or your cell phone may be unusable for a few hours during the transfer.",1435557038

Without funding, the line between failure and not is way more blurry;  but you fail the same.  Sometimes those failures come with emotional problems, sometimes not.    When failures don&#x27;t come with emotional problems, cleanup is easy.  Get a job and do financial cleanup.<p>When the failures come with emotional problems, well, then it&#x27;s harder.  For me?  I think it&#x27;s a bad idea to go to my contacts when my performance is below a certain level, because... I&#x27;m just not performing up to my usual standards, and actually doing a job with people who expect me to perform at the level of most of my friends would be a challenge when I&#x27;m fully functional.  And when I&#x27;m really messed up? expecting me to perform at the level I&#x27;ve been capable of performing at in the past is a bit unrealistic.<p>But, the problem is that my job is absolutely central to who I am.  I&#x27;m not going to get better until I get a  job and feel like I&#x27;m making forward progress at that job.  That&#x27;s just how I work.<p>So... personally?  I go through body shops when I&#x27;m like this.    Why?  Mostly because employers don&#x27;t go for the body shop until they&#x27;ve exhausted their contacts.   They don&#x27;t know any more good people, so they&#x27;ll settle for warm bodies.    And depressed-me can meet those standards, usually.  I&#x27;ll probably even have enough skill-margin for them to put up with the downsides of me still being messed up.<p>And eh, I&#x27;ve had good luck with getting help from the managers;  I mean, my big problem is staying on-task, and that gets way worse when I&#x27;m not in a good place, mentally, and my experience?  managers in those situations seem to be pretty cool with me asking them for help with that sort of thing.  I think they know the score, too.  They know they&#x27;re gonna get second-raters from the body shop, and they&#x27;re willing to put some effort if it looks like some effort can turn you into something useful.<p>When the economy is good like this, most of the gigs you will find are &quot;contract to hire&quot;  - meaning you work for them for a year, and if the economy is still good in a year, they&#x27;ll offer to hire you on full-time, which gives you a nice path forward, if you still need training wheels after the first year is up.     When the economy is bad, that expectation isn&#x27;t set, but the rules are about the same either way.<p>Oh yeah, to get a body shop job?  put your resume on DICE.   take the calls, listen carefully, reject jobs you aren&#x27;t qualified for (the body shops aren&#x27;t qualified to do that, and you will go to a lot of interviews for jobs you aren&#x27;t qualified for if you don&#x27;t take charge of the filtering)<p>But yeah, especially if you are in the bay area,  body shops are like a million times better than e-lance",1435556626

What I took from it is: buildings are like anything, we can&#x27;t just imagine them in abstract and have them turn out perfectly.  Reality is messy, people are complex; there are a hundred things you can&#x27;t imagine up front that need to be attended to before a building really meets the needs of its inhabitants.<p>In that light his argument for bricks vs concrete is that bricks are very easy and low-tech to adjust after the fact.  Concrete is amazingly resistant to change.<p>Having said that, maybe we just need another set of robots for sawing up set concrete, but I&#x27;d call that a harder problem than printing it in the first place, and perhaps bricks still have a role to play in the interim.",1435556269

9796580,comment,9796029,9796029,0,0,seism,,,"Preparation goes a long way to create a great event. Start planning at least 3 months in advance. Do pre-hackathon meetups, where people already start brainstorming projects. On a wiki, have lists of data sources, resources to get started, links to the best tools, and example projects. In e-mails to registered participants get people excited and thinking ahead and perhaps contributing or voting up ideas on a project site.<p>All this will make your mix-and-matches easier, because the more people have a good idea of what their aims are at the hackathon, the easier it will be for others to join in and collaborate. Especially if you have hundreds of teams.<p>As to the actual format of the mix-and-match, I&#x27;ve seen it all as participant or as organiser, and there is no best way to do it. In smaller groups, post-it-note or chalkboard brainstorming works well to get people to agree on one idea. For larger events like yours you should have people there to challenge participants to use an API or dataset or device, solve a particular problem, work in a particular way. You could even have people hang up posters of what they plan to work on and let the crowd sift its way through. Or you could leave it completely open, just distribute people into groups and let them have at it, like at some dinner parties.<p>Closing thought: set your expectations well. Your sponsor must have a vision for the hackathon, otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t sponsor it. Support them in making this vision clear to yourself and others involved in organisation, and finally make sure the participants are well aware of what they are there to do. Then put in an earnest effort into making the event great: be there, make sure people are having fun, build an atmosphere of empowerment and community, using whatever has worked best for you in the past (e.g. food, music, ambiance, geek toys, VIP visitors, ...).<p>And let us know how it goes! :)",1435556204

When it lands on my site I can decrypt it and know who sent that click to me and note it. Then, on conversion, pay that person.<p>The challenge this system has is that it doesn&#x27;t let you throw your ads into a distribution bucket and wait for them to land on some site that is buying some traffic from some traffic provider. You have to know the sites (and presumably their IP addresses) where it lands. I need a relationship between the site showing the ad, and me. Then I can be sure that anyone who clicks on that ad, and then buys something from me, I can credit the sale to that site.<p>What is useful (and to some extent different) about this scheme is that you can compute ad spend against revenue generated. There is no &#x27;fraud&#x27; because you don&#x27;t pay unless someone &quot;converts&quot; (the term for making transaction). What it does do however is cut off all the shady ad networks and packagers and skimlinkers and what not because they don&#x27;t add value for a large brand like Macy&#x27;s or Target or Amazon.<p>So a blog like TechCrunch with a relationship with Target can give target an exact number of how much business has arrived at Target because of their ad on Techcrunch stories. And Target can compute exactly how much revenue the clicks that landed there from TechCrunch generated. And from their existing understanding of life time value of a customer who has landed on their site and made a purchase, they can price the value of that advertisement fairly precisely. TechCrunch gets feedback on how much their ads are worth to Target and can choose to make every ad a target ad if they think it will maximize revenue, base on the <i>performance</i> not on the click through rate. Target could lie about conversions, but that would be self defeating in the long term (they want people to land on their site and want people to carry their advertising).<p>If we learned anything from the meteoric rise of Google as an advertising behemoth it is that people will pay for metrics and demonstrable results.

If they want the next kit they pay $20, but they also have to give the previous kit to a noob first. The second kit would how them how to get all the components/compounds they need generally free or cheap.",1435554343

PS2 VU programming was in some senses more complicated - on NUON you just had to stuff as many slots in a packet as possible e.g. you could write a jump to self and had like 20 slots for instructions in there (the jump packet itself and 2 delay packets, each was 6 or 7 instructions possible if memory serves) but on PS2 you had to be more clever with hiding latency between dual pipes. A loop on PS2 would be processing several items at once, eg stage 1 for the current idex, stage 2 for the previous index and the final stage for the current index - 2.<p>Programmers at the time were okay with this and it was actually fun. The tools though were much better for the competition, on PS2 I could set break points anywhere (even on memory reads) and see the DMA streams in the debugger, on NUON it was pretty much debugging with prints except you had to write the print yourself :)",1435554272

We didn&#x27;t make any money and while we did have a few interested clients, to keep going we needed funding that didn&#x27;t come. End of the day, it was the wrong product. Period.<p>So - lesson learned.<p>I did try odesk/elance for a while but you can&#x27;t make any money from it. My work is more embedded, and systems programming and the jobs on places like odesk are suited for very low end webdev. (The good webdev work isn&#x27;t on odesk). As a result, they are very low paying.<p>I called that quits pretty quickly and started looking for a job. It took me a couple of interviews (including bombing the first one) before I found work. I&#x27;m pretty happy now. It pays the bills, but I am saving up for my next startup sometime in the future.<p>In short, don&#x27;t be disheartened.
