We coders are trained for abstracting things, but real world requirements sometimes change and your perfectly abstract module needs some non-generic functionality.  Of course, there are software engineering techniques to solve these problems, but hey you didn&#x27;t foresee these changes and now need to bill your client for these adjustments.<p>So the trick is achieving a good balance between redundancy and dependencies.  This is probably what seniority means in software development.",1434538751

There are a number of scenarios where opt-in doesn&#x27;t make sense. For example, imagine a system that used facial recognition in a retail setting to detect shoplifters and alert management to their presence. If you had been caught stealing in the store in the past, you would be enrolled into the system by the retailer. Each person entering the store (as seen on their already existing surveillance systems) would be checked against that database of shoplifters. How realistic would it be for the retailer to get written opt-in consent from the criminal?</i><p>I agree with the EFF is opposing this type of system,  Retailers should not be allowed to &quot;enroll&quot; people in a Scarlet Letter system.  The Credit System is already fucked up enough with very limited recourse for people that abuse it to extort consumers.<p>Retailers should not have that kind of power...",1434538629

When we reach just mildly confusing queries, the differences are very noticeable. One example from the top of my head: Searching for &quot;devise&quot;, a popular ruby gem, yields several unrelated results before the actual Gem on DDG, while Google has the Github page as first result.

9730975,comment,9730492,9730492,0,0,d--b,,,"This article is very important. I encourage everyone to read it, as it raises a lot of good points.<p>In my opinion, the problem it describes come from the vagueness of the concept of elegance, and how counterintuitive it is. It doesn&#x27;t even have to imply modules or anything like that. In the simplest form it boils down to:<p>Would you rather write:<p><pre><code>    if (a) {\n        doSomething();\n        if (b) {\n            doSomethingElse();\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nor<p><pre><code>    if (a && b) {\n       doSomething();\n       doSomethingElse();\n    }\n    else if (a && !b) {\n       doSomething();\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOf course, there is no true answer to that question, and it always depends on the context. But many programmers will never ever consider option 2. And that is for two good reasons: 1, you make one more test, and 2 you duplicate the function call do doSomething(), so your program is larger. So mathematically speaking option 1 is more elegant, it&#x27;s shorter, it&#x27;s faster, it&#x27;s lighter, what&#x27;s not to like?<p>Well, multiply the ifs and the elses, and you will soon find out that option 2 is much more readable and changeable, which is the more elegant solution to anyone who&#x27;s an engineer rather than a mathematician.<p>The tension it describes is that in every programmer is a mathematician and an engineer endlessly conflicting. This should be a good guidance for which style to use. Is this code a math code, or is it engineer&#x27;s code. When you can answer that question, you can decide which style to write your code in.",1434538249

This is ofc. hard as it requires a lot of self experimentation to pinpoint most likely agent involved.<p>As analogy, if you find yourself gluten intolerant, you will probably tend to avoid the thing rather then thinking that you should simply ignore it as that is your nature.<p>There is no evolutionary benefit in being obese (there is some merit in being slightly overweight with aged individuals) - you predispose yourself to myriad of problems (diabetes, CHD, low vitamin D content, bone stress etc.), you limit your agility (which was not good idea back in time) and so on. So there is NOTHING natural in this.<p>Plus, you actually don&#x27;t have to starve - ketogenic diet mimics starvation effects without the actual starvation. I lost 25 kg before 5 years using it and gained 7 afterwards because of my later life choices (extremely sedentary lifestyle and adoption of higher level of carbs). What I learned is that carbs obviously don&#x27;t agree with me and that my mass starts to rise very fast as soon as I adopt more of them without exercising (which would redirect those carbs to muscles, not fat, if done in proper time frame).",1434535686
