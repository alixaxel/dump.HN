It implements Clojure&#x27;s type inference in the editor, so method calls are accurately resolved to the right method based on the number and types of the parameters, and completion takes this into account so that you can explore Java APIs almost as well as with Java in IntelliJ. Cross-language navigation and Find Usages works - in Cursive you can navigate from RT.var() calls to the Clojure code, and Find Usages from Clojure will find the RT.var() calls. This also works for other JVM languages - there are quite a few Cursive users with mixed Clojure/Scala codebases, and this all works there.<p>You can search for all usages of a particular keyword, and it will also find all local bindings destructured from it using :keys. Namespaces will be auto-required during completion based on examples elsewhere in your project, not hard-coded config. This works in the REPL too - you can type str/tr and when it&#x27;s completed into str/trim Cursive will automatically (require &#x27;[clojure.string :as str]) in your REPL.<p>One other nice thing is that since Cursive works from source, pretty much everything that works for Clojure works for CLJS too.<p>There&#x27;s lots more along the same lines, hopefully this gives you an idea. Again, there&#x27;s nothing wrong per se with Emacs&#x27; navigation, but IntelliJ just provides a much more sophisticated infrastructure for it. Obviously elisp is Turing-complete so all this could in theory be implemented but it&#x27;s much harder, as Yegge describes in the article I linked in my other comment. The clj-refactor guys are doing a great job but the lack of a good indexing infrastructure is going to mean that a lot of this functionality is hard or impossible to implement.<p>Emacs is a great choice for a lot of people and if you&#x27;re willing to invest the time to trick it out and maintain it, especially for Clojure you can get a really nice environment. But probably the feature that most people like about Cursive is that it just works out of the box, and stays working with no messing around and no development of your editor required. And WRT my original comment - to say that Emacs has the most sophisticated runtime analysis is just wrong.",1434509998

9729830,comment,9722726,9725955,0,0,icefox,,,"Binaries are built automatically these days using tools like Jenkins, Travis.ci, etc and not by developers.  There are many ways to solve this problem such as the build bot making tags in a repository that isn&#x27;t the main one, but suffice it to say developers are not making the binaries so using a developer account to push the tag from the build machine seems like a permissions bug and letting developers push tags also would risk someone accidentally deleting a tag or pushing a tag that is wrong or can&#x27;t be reproduced by the build server.<p>Another example is having a machine the mirrors a perforce, svn or other rcs.  This bot will push up the mirror to a single branch called say &#x27;svn-mirror&#x27;.  You want to make sure that the mirror bot is the only one that can ever touch this branch.  Again the mirror could be its own repo and no one else could be allowed to do anything, but users like to have the mirror along side the other main branches that they can push to.<p>I can give you a dozen &quot;edge case&quot; examples, each of which I have seen not only desired, but required.  Lack of fine grain permissions are one of the three reason why companies (not individuals) will abandon an existing Git server and replace it with an alternative.  (See <a href=""http://benjamin-meyer.blogspot.com/2014/10/so-you-want-to-build-git-server.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://benjamin-meyer.blogspot.com/2014/10/so-you-want-to-bu...</a> for my full writeup)  And you can&#x27;t say it is hard to implement either, these permissions are nothing but cascading ref based permissions.   A user or group has permissions to read/write/delete a ref or ref regular expression.  Honestly just copy what gitolite (which has no frontend so it constantly being passed over) does and you will be ahead of all of your competition.<p>Add fine grain permissions to GitLab and I would recommend exploring going through the major hassle and pain of replacing Stash with GitLab, that is how valuable of a feature it is.  Eventually Stash and the other Git servers will have this capability, might as well beat them to the punch and take some of their customers.",1434509106

Protocol decoders are really great.<p>Little endian is more natural for data structures.

I also have a special interest in information systems of the 1950s and 1960s - the era of the &quot;information explosion&quot; - and have been reading many papers and essays from that era.<p>What you say about the Gray Lady is true, but only a part of history. I&#x27;m also old enough to remember Walter Cronkite&#x27;s &quot;And that&#x27;s the way it is&quot; signoff. You might remember that Johnson is said to have said &quot;If I&#x27;ve lost Cronkite, I&#x27;ve lost Middle America&quot; after Cronkite&#x27;s &quot;Report from Vietnam: Who, What, When, Where, Why?&quot; editorial.<p>&quot;The New York Times (primarily) really replaced the Catholic Church as the cultural maypole.&quot;<p>That is nonsense. For one, it&#x27;s American-centric, as &quot;The Times&quot; of London (and source for Times New Roman) used to be much more important on the world stage than the NYT. The NYT both started later than The Times, and derived its name from the London paper. Remember, it was The Times (of London) which first reported on Krakatoa, which was the first major natural disaster to appear after the world-wide telegraph was put into place. Not the NYT. And London was the world center in telecommunications.<p>For another, the US was anti-papist long before the NYT started. The Catholic church was not a &#x27;cultural maypole&#x27; in the US. (And how delicious to use the pagan maypole to describe the Catholic church! But do you mean &#x27;touchstone&#x27;?) We were still wary about Catholicism in 1960, which is why Kennedy declared &quot;I am not the Catholic candidate for President. I am the Democratic Party&#x27;s candidate for President who also happens to be a Catholic. I do not speak for my Church on public matters – and the Church does not speak for me.&quot;<p>Early American anti-papist leanings come from its British cultural heritage. Great Britain was institutionally anti-Catholic since the Act of Supremacy of 1534 and restrictions against Roman Catholics were still in place until full Catholic Emancipation in 1829.<p>It&#x27;s easy to prove me wrong. The NYT started in 1851. Can you demonstrate how the Catholic church was an important &#x27;cultural maypole&#x27; in the US before then?<p>> I think we agree TV was a major technological creation and certainly changed society but it did not challenge the newspapers for social power and influence<p>Yet there are articles like &quot;The Kennedy-Nixon Debates: When TV Changed the Game&quot; describing the growing social power and influence of televion <a href=""http://time.com/26035/kennedy-nixon-debates-1960-the-tv-landmark-that-changed-the-game/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://time.com/26035/kennedy-nixon-debates-1960-the-tv-land...</a> .

Plus you need it to survive for the life of your production run.<p>On a large scale, this means using hardened steel[1[ milled or EDM&#x27;d from a solid block. The texture of the inside of the mould cavity directly determines the surface finish of your parts, so it needs to be polished mirror smooth, even though it&#x27;s probably not flat.<p>Then it gets even more fancy.  The moulds usually need channels bored through them  as close as possible to the cavity, which will allow coolant to be pumped through to set the plastic faster so it can be ejected.  Some complex shapes also have internally embedded heating elements to keep the plastic liquified for long enough to reach where it needs to be.<p>Then you have the ejector mechanisms, usually some pins driven pneumatically to push the solid moulding out of the fixture at the end of the cycle. They need to retract to precisely the right depth during moulding otherwise you end up with those little dimples characteristic of IM parts.<p>And it gets crazier still: some parts will have embedded metal or other plastic parts such as bearings or threaded screw inserts. These get inserted each cycle by a robotic fixture when the mould is open. It then closes up and the plastic is injected around them.  Doing this with multiple types or colours of plastic is the &#x27;double-shot&#x27; technique that lets you put rubberised grips or other embedded features into things.<p>Oh, and time is money, so each part is ejected as soon as possible to start on the next cycle, so everything has to be incredibly delicately choreographed, but left long enough that you get a decent yield of useable parts.<p>When I learned about all of that (and probably a whole lot more I don&#x27;t know), it makes sense how expensive the whole thing is upfront. There&#x27;s also the costs incurred by your factory in shutting down production to change out the tooling to run your job.<p>One of the coolest things I&#x27;ve seen online is Kenneth Maxon&#x27;s home-made injection moulding rig[3] (although just about all the other things he does are pretty astounding too. I&#x27;d claim it&#x27;s only technically home-made because he lives there ;p)<p>[1] Protomold[2] get away with doing it a lot cheaper because they mill moulds out of aluminium, which is much less durable but entirely acceptable for short production runs.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.protolabs.com/injection-molding/fundamentals-of-molding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.protolabs.com/injection-molding/fundamentals-of-m...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.users.qwest.net/~kmaxon/page/side/mold_mach_137.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.users.qwest.net/~kmaxon/page/side/mold_mach_137.h...</a> [4]<p>[4] WARNING: serious 90&#x27;s webdesign, and sadly a lot of broken images.",1434506972

CF is not an ISP, but it is a in-between that simply provides services to help keep sites online and fast. CloudFlare is content-agnostic in this way.<p>I guess the weakness of my argument in that regard is that if CF is confronted with information showing that their service, even passively, is aiding illegal activity, and they refuse to intervene or investigate- that becomes a problem. Because even with the service being passive, it&#x27;s still aiding (without intent), but their refusal to intervene makes it seem like they have some intent to continue aiding the activity.<p>Man, what a mess of words this turned out to be, sorry.",1434506940

They had an ISA or microcode layer that all apps were compiled to. Then, that was compiled onto whatever hardware they ran on. When IBM switched to POWER processors, the just modified that low layer to compile to POWER processors. That let them run the old apps without recompilation of their original source. They used this strategy over and over for decades. Always one to keep in mind.<p>Going further, I think a team could get interesting results combining this with design-by-contract, typed assembly, and certified compilation. Much like verification condition generators, the compilation process would keep a set of conditions that should be true regardless of what form the code is in. By the time it gets to the lower level, those conditions & the data types can be used in the final compile to real architecture. It would preserve a context for doing safe/secure optimizations, transforms, and integration without the original source.",1434506641
