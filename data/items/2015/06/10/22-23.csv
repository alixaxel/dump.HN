Well, because those were <i>your</i> believes and most likely not the true depiction of who Max Howell is.<p>Have you worked or interacted with Max at all? I bet you not. If you did, you will see that he&#x27;s not the egotistical and arrogant person that you depicted. [0]<p>To me, Max was just really frustrated and venting on the fact that Google passed on him because he failed in a whiteboard session of an algorithmic question, disregarding the fact that he has been proven to be a great developer who can ship code and a track record of teamwork and tremendous contribution to the open source community. And you know what, I am pretty sure Max can solve that whiteboard question with a little bit of preparation. It&#x27;s unfortunate that Google interview process is designed to judge people on a simple algorithmic question. So, Google&#x27;s loss on this one IMMO.<p>While I completely disagree with you on most of your judgements, I do agree with you on one point, that is, it&#x27;s probably not going to be a fit (scientist vs. engineer). It&#x27;s okay for companies to screen out experienced developers/engineers on academic knowledge, even though it&#x27;s silly.<p>PS: I am not sure where the &quot;90%&quot; came from, but it&#x27;s not &quot;absurd&quot; to believe considering Google&#x27;s standard equipment issue has been predominantly Macs in recent years[1].<p>PPS: Max applied for an iOS developer role not a scientist role.<p>[0] <a href=""https://github.com/mxcl?tab=activity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mxcl?tab=activity</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://bgr.com/2013/11/28/mac-chromebook-google-employees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bgr.com/2013/11/28/mac-chromebook-google-employees/</a>",1433977162

And the point where things get confusing for me is that architecture is reasoning about structure in general, where as implementation is reasoning about structure in specifics. So there is nothing architecturally significant about byte codes with respect to computer architecture, other than you can simulate a variety of architectural choices by how you define your byte codes.<p><pre><code>   > So every program needs to be wrapped in an \n   > additional VM?\n</code></pre>\nNo. The point was that your blog post conflated computer architecture with an implementation choice made by a particular vendor. Many vendors have chosen to create implementations which make implementing self modifying code difficult. They have their reasons, and you elucidated on two of them, rights management and security.<p>That they have done so, gives them some benefit, and it comes at some cost to you, the developer.<p>When looked at from a cost / benefit point of view, I would be interested to read about how those design choices constrain your ability to deliver a compelling game experience, or a needed capability. To often these things are only discussed in terms of what they do for party A or party B and rarely do we get some thinking on what we cannot have because of the constraints imposed by their implementation choice.",1433976585

This takes many forms, from street confrontations with fascists, protests at book readings and other events, and also disrupting fascist conferences and similar.<p>Anti-Racist Action is the organization that has developed the most tactical and strategic influence in this space, not by design, but by chance (and it largely doesn&#x27;t exist anymore). Disrupting fascist meetings by denying them space by getting hotels to drop them is the bread and butter of any ARA chapter. It&#x27;s the easiest thing to do, and most modern tumblerites aren&#x27;t willing to get in the streets with a bandanna and a baseball bat, so it&#x27;s what gets done now. And in fact, it&#x27;s likely that this sort of thing happens because ARA activists got involved in more liberal groups, etc., and the tactics just trickled down.<p>Personally, I have developed political differences with the &quot;SJW&quot; orthodoxy myself (though obviously in the other direction), and have seen the effects of this sort of attack applied on a social level. It has made my own work slightly more difficult, because I have to pick my comrades more carefully to ensure that they won&#x27;t alienate me from my network. But this isn&#x27;t a big deal for leftists, because there are already so many camps that are mutually oppositional that you&#x27;d need to do that already for some of your politics anyway. What&#x27;s new in the last few years is having that extend away from your class alignment. (This is an answer to a question you didn&#x27;t really ask, which is how the &quot;SJW&quot; community itself is affected by this, though it is what came to mind when I asked myself how I felt about it.)<p>As far as this issue and other similar issues are concerned, I&#x27;m overjoyed that, as you put it, a climate of fear exists for fascists, misogynists, racists, and similar. I hope that this continues and only worsens for these people.<p>I&#x27;m happy for many reasons. The first is that it has, as you&#x27;ve said, made privileged people afraid. I think this is only the beginning. Privilege creates safety, and as it is removed, I think the unsafety of the oppressed will in part come to the currently privileged classes. But if I could flip a switch and make every man feel the persistent, gnawing fear that a woman has of men, I would in a heartbeat. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider whether the consequences were strategic, I would just do it.<p>I&#x27;m also happy that these people are achieving real victories. This is nearly impossible to do in a post-reformist landscape, and so the people involved in getting this fascist kicked out of this conference will have a real victory under their belt where their friends who are campaigning against some law that will inevitably pass or for some reform that will inevitably never happen won&#x27;t. I hope that these victories can motivate people into taking more action. Burnout is a huge problem in activism and successes stave it off.<p>I would not say that I set out to defeat a &quot;discourse-stifling&quot; monster. The monsters I set out to defeat were patriarchy, capitalism, and white supremacy. These systems violently oppress, they don&#x27;t &quot;stifle discourse.&quot; In fact, they LOVE discourse! When people are discoursing, they aren&#x27;t in the streets. I&#x27;ve seen so many promising movements hobbled by reformism that I&#x27;m glad the possibility no longer exists, though that isn&#x27;t at all the fault of SJW-outrage (and is rather a consequence of the fact that the economy is in large part so perilous that nobody can afford the concessions that were previously won by reformists). So if discourse is permanently removed as a tactical and strategic option for future leftists, I&#x27;ll consider it a victory.<p>You might be unsurprised to find out that free speech is not valued on the left or among &quot;SJW&quot; groups. I suggest you research this further, because I can&#x27;t communicate to you in a single hacker news comment why this is, or what theoretical basis it has.",1433976328

This re-orders the code&#x27;s side-effects, which is why Haskell has to enforce the correct ordering using datatypes like IO.<p>- Ban such uses. Just use &quot;if&quot;. If that&#x27;s not good enough, propose a language extension and wait for it to appear in compilers.<p>- Use thunks. To delay something, wrap it in a function. To force it, call the function. This works, but splits our values into two worlds, causing a combinatorial explosion of decisions to be made (should condition be a thunk? Should we return a thunk?):<p><pre><code>    (defun unless (condition branch)\n      (if condition\n          nil\n          (branch)))\n\n    ;; Works\n    (unless keep\n            (lambda () (delete-file &quot;foo.txt&quot;)))\n</code></pre>\n- Implement a macro system. This acts on the syntax, before it&#x27;s been evaluated into a value. This is splitting &quot;callable things&quot; into two worlds, functions and macros, rather than all values. This actually isn&#x27;t an issue most of the time; since functions&#x27; APIs vary so much already (arity, return values, types, etc.)<p><pre><code>    (defmacro unless (condition branch)\n      `(if ,condition\n           nil\n           ,branch))\n\n    ;; Works\n    (unless keep\n            (delete-file &quot;foo.txt&quot;))\n</code></pre>\n- Do everything with syntax rewriting! That&#x27;s what languages like Pure and Maude do. In effect, everything&#x27;s a macro. It takes discipline to ensure execution follows a straightforward path though (which usually boils down to &quot;write everything as if they were functions&quot;)",1433975886

On the other hand, there are statically dependently typed languages that collapse the type and value level, letting you make things like type functions. There is also multi-stage programming -- why choose between evaluating code at runtime or compile time when you can choose to evaluate it at compile time, runtime, or any arbitrary stage in between?

9696009,comment,9695102,9695547,0,0,peteretep,,,"Rambling weirdness stream of consciousness, but, yeah you might well be right... how hard can it be to reverse a binary tree? Isn&#x27;t the &quot;real&quot; solution to sound out the solution as you go, and let the interviewer know what you&#x27;re thinking?<p>I&#x27;ve never attempted to do this before, and my compsci is real weak, to the point where I&#x27;m going to make an educated guess about what a binary tree even _IS_ so... Let&#x27;s start with what is a binary tree? Presumably we have a tree where every node has zero or two child nodes. Clue is in the name. In fact, that&#x27;s an implementation detail, so let&#x27;s say we have a tree where every node has a place two hold a left and a right node, where either can be null. Guessing that in order to be useful, the nodes need to hold a value. We need to choose a language here, and I know a miniscule amount of Go, and surely the cool kids at Google like Go, so:<p><pre><code>    type Node struct {\n        Value int\n        Left *Node\n        Right *Node\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd so now we can do something like:<p><pre><code>    n := Node{ Value: 50, Left: &Node{ Value: 30, Left: &Node{ Value: 10 } }}\n    n.Right = &Node{ Value: 80 }\n</code></pre>\nNow what does it mean to &quot;reverse&quot; a binary tree? Are we simply swapping all Left values for Right values? It feels a bit like there might be a trick here. So let&#x27;s draw a binary tree with some numbers, and think about what reversing it might look like:<p><pre><code>           Input                    Output\n\n            50                        50\n        40      60                60      40\n      35  45  55  65            65  55  45  35\n</code></pre>\nActually, that looks pretty reasonable to me, and that&#x27;s a straight flip of each Node&#x27;s pieces. I had wondered if I might need to only swap at every other depth, but this just looks like simply swapping over the left and the right branch will work fine.<p>We can either iterate or recurse here, right, because it&#x27;s a nested data structure, and I once read almost the first two chapters of SICP, and I&#x27;m pretty sure those are the options. So, let&#x27;s have a quick think about the memory / performance implications of that. I cannot think of a way we can avoid visiting each node here; perhaps there is one, but cards on the table, I can&#x27;t think of one. So let&#x27;s assume we have a runtime cost that will grow linearly with the number of nodes. If that&#x27;s the case, I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s what the cool kids call O(n) - maybe that&#x27;s O(1), but I&#x27;m sure Wikipedia can tell me.<p>So the mechanics of switching any given Node looks pretty easy:<p><pre><code>    nr := n.Left\n    n.Left = n.Right\n    n.Right = nr\n</code></pre>\nThat should handle nil no problem too. But we also have to switch the children. If my original assumption about having to talk to every node is correct, what the question really wants to do is know if we can do this in a way that isn&#x27;t too much of a memory hog. Now a simple recursive method would do this, for sure:<p><pre><code>    func (n *Node) recursiveReverse() {\n        nr := n.Left\n        n.Left = n.Right\n        n.Right = nr\n        if n.Left != nil {\n            n.Left.recursiveReverse()\n        }\n        if n.Right != nil {\n            n.Right.recursiveReverse()\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nBut while I know _NOTHING_ about how Go&#x27;s callstack works, I bet it doesn&#x27;t do magical optimization to stop it simply growing and growing and growing, which I think the cool kids call &quot;tail optimization&quot;. At this point, one turns to the interviewer and says &quot;How big do these trees get?&quot;, and makes some point about simple and elegant solutions to problems that make developers lives easy, because hardware and processing power is cheap. Let&#x27;s assume the interviewer doesn&#x27;t let you off the hook so easily...<p>Let&#x27;s take a second to think about the memory consumption of what we&#x27;ve got here. At the moment, we add a new ... thingy (are they called frames? I have no clue) to our callstack for each child, and our worst case scenario then is the maximum depth of the tree. No-one has told us if our tree balances, but I suspect that if it does, you could then describe the max-depth using a formula involving `log` and the total known nodes. Wikipedia would know.<p>What else could we do? You could keep an explicit stack of nodes you knew you still needed to be visited, and go depth first. My gut feeling there is that you could write this where you get a worst-case scenario of your stack getting as big as the deepest node, plus one or two. If you wanted a truly iterative approach, you would need to store a pointer to the parent in each Node; there&#x27;s a memory (or storage) cost to that too, so how often do we actually need to reverse the binary tree? That&#x27;s a question to think about.<p>Given all this, then, one comes down to: what&#x27;s the relative memory pressure that each frame in the call stack exerts, as opposed to pushing a pointer on to the end of an array in Go? Oooh, Go arrays are immutable, so actually you need to think about slices, unless you already know the size of the tree, and can preallocate exactly as much memory as you need. I wonder if there are memory implications there? With my commercial hat on, again, how much does this actually need optimizing?<p>Anyway, those are the considerations that come to mind; it would be worth checking Wikipedia for a nice iterative approach here, or if there&#x27;s a sensible known algorithm. I&#x27;m going to stick with the recursive version I had above as my whiteboard version.<p>Did I get the job?",1433974871

I walked away from Fallingwater thinking that the house was a beautiful representation of the juncture where nature and architecture meet and nothing more. Then I emailed Neil Levine, a professor of history and architecture at Harvard University, to ask for an interview.<p>> Levine replied promptly, but to my dismay, he told me he was too busy to talk. Furthermore he mentioned that I would do better not to engage with jargon like “organic architecture.” I was slighted, yes, but also intrigued.<p>> In 2011 Levine published an essay titled “The Temporal Dimension of Fallingwater,” where he argues that time—and not just nature—is crucial to Wright’s design. This temporal element was a direct consequence of the natural setting. The stream, including the waterfall, isn’t only a place where the horizontal meets the vertical, but also where the motionless meets the turbulent, the silent meets the thundering, and the finite meets the infinite. The stream is some combination of both sides. By placing the house above the falls, Wright furthers this juxtaposition.<p>It&#x27;s worth understanding here that just because Levine has a Ph.D. doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s right or the author of the article is wrong. Levine&#x27;s imperative as a research scholar is to come up with different and novel ideas about the architecture he studies, and as such, when looking at a long-studied work like Fallingwater, it&#x27;s no surprise he might try to come up with a new opinion.<p>But ultimately, it&#x27;s just an opinion, and the barrier of evidence for such opinion is pretty low. It&#x27;s not math where there are proofs, it&#x27;s hypothesizing about the meaning of something which is experienced subjectively. One could make persuasive statements about the intentions of Wright, or about the experiences of people experiencing Wright&#x27;s work, but to talk about a building as if it&#x27;s objectively a temporal work is just wankery. And if Levine wants to argue that point as if it were objective truth rather than an interesting way to view Fallingwater, that makes him a wanker.",1433974551

Everything guides you towards good development practice; of course you could manage your scripts in the same way, but you&#x27;d have to do so by hand, and with the best of intentions I&#x27;ve never seen any team that used scripts have the discipline to manage them properly.<p>Good developers can make good things with bad tools and bad developers can make bad things with good tools yes, but even so, tooling and defaults are extremely important.",1433974545
