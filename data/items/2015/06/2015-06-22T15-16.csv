I did look at BJTs (in fact the whole thing started because I wanted to teach myself about &quot;proper&quot; transistors) but working out what resistor values to use to cope with varying fanouts/ins etc was too scary for me. One of the fundamental drivers when making design choices was that I really really want it to work when its built, it&#x27;ll be heartbreaking if/when it doesn&#x27;t, so I try to favour robustness.<p>The single MOSFET is also, I&#x27;m currently guessing, the cause of the slow speed. If you look at how the professionals (chip makers) do gates they tend to have two versions of the logic, one driving the positive case and the other driving the negative using both P and N MOSFETS. So the output is actively driven either way. My circuits only actively drive in one direction and rely on a pullup resistor (the 10ks) to generate a 1 output. Halves the number of transistors I need, but cripples the speed. I need to do some experiments to prove/disprove that.<p>I am planning on putting the design files on the website.<p>And I&#x27;m in Cambridge UK as opposed to Cambridge MA.",1434988777

Even for a company like Google, which routinely does this.  There are a zillion horror stories resulting from their closed allocation policy, like the hardware guy who was given a job doing vaguely hardware related Python programming.  Without the option of moving to another team for 18 months per Google&#x27;s policy (<i>de facto</i> if not <i>de jure</i>), he had no choice but to quickly resign to avoid ruining his career.<p>And I should mention what happened in my last job, where I wasn&#x27;t able to do that, and the boss I was assigned to, who had absolutely no buy in, he wasn&#x27;t given a choice about my working for him, took an <i>instant</i> dislike to me.  That did not end well.<p>Echoing the theme of this subthread, for my last N jobs, in all but one recruitment I was substantially lied to.  The one before that said I&#x27;d get enough time to review the org&#x27;s <i>long</i> abandoned legacy software before a very firm (government contract) commitment to how long it would take to make it viable again.<p>Before that, the manager didn&#x27;t reveal she&#x27;d taken an offer to move to a subsidiary that was splitting off.  She guilelessly told me that the previous attempt to hire someone in my position failed because she&#x27;d mentioned that.  That job ended when<p>The company before that had a pattern of hiring a &quot;second&quot; techie only after the current one had given notice, without telling prospects they&#x27;d soon be responsible for it all.<p>Two before that I learned later that my boss didn&#x27;t want to hire me, but I was the only one who passed his whiteboard programming test (which for me was so easy I hardly remembered it by that time) and the company would have otherwise died, and I was fired as soon as they convinced the guy they really wanted to move from SV back to the D.C. area.<p>Before that, I joined a company just as a couple of devil investors took it over with what we soon enough learned was the express intent of owning <i>all</i> the company; they deliberately sabotaged the launch just to have 100% of nothing (granted, this was investor betrayal, in the denouncement 13 of us simultaneously resigned).<p>Before that, no bad faith can remember, at least starting out, and those jobs and organizations were substantially more successful.  If this sort of thing has indeed become a pattern, we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised by general economic stagnation, whatever the other secular causes there might be.",1434988766

However I have read some of Britain First&#x27;s facebook pages and the comments there are hateful, vitriolic and most of the time barely literate.<p>I actually agree with most of what you said here. I believe that Islam does have some serious structural problems, along with many other religions. Muslim friends say that indeed the Quran is pretty transparently calling for non-muslim&#x27;s death, and it seems to be seized upon readily as the raison d&#x27;être for many of these terrible groups.<p>As for the asian sex grooming, this is exactly this kind of thing that far right groups jump on. Suddenly it&#x27;s muslim grooming gangs vs a group of men abusing children. Don&#x27;t forget that within the Catholic church there has also been widespread abuse that&#x27;s been covered up <i>by</i> the church. Somehow there isn&#x27;t a pervasive implication that being Catholic means that you&#x27;re more likely to be a child abuser. In case there was any doubt, yes grooming children for sex slavery is more despicable than whipping up hatred for an entire religion based on said abuse.<p>I believe the way to counter &quot;lumping people together, generalizing and stereotyping&quot; or othering is precisely to point out the flaws in logic and call it bigotry and hatred when you see it.",1434988702

Here’s an insightful paragraph from James Hague’s blog post Organization skills beat algorithmic wizardry:<p>When it comes to writing code, the number one most important skill is how to keep a tangle of features from collapsing under the weight of its own complexity. I’ve worked on large telecommunications systems, console games, blogging software, a bunch of personal tools, and very rarely is there some tricky data structure or algorithm that casts a looming shadow over everything else. But there’s always lots of state to keep track of, rearranging of values, handling special cases, and carefully working out how all the pieces of a system interact. To a great extent the act of coding is one of organization. Refactoring. Simplifying. Figuring out how to remove extraneous manipulations here and there.<p>Algorithmic wizardry is easier to teach and easier to blog about than organizational skill, so we teach and blog about it instead. A one-hour class, or a blog post, can showcase a clever algorithm. But how do you present a clever bit of organization? If you jump to the solution, it’s unimpressive. “Here’s something simple I came up with. It may not look like much, but trust me, it was really hard to realize this was all I needed to do.” Or worse, “Here’s a moderately complicated pile of code, but you should have seen how much more complicated it was before. At least now someone stands a shot of understanding it.” Ho hum. I guess you had to be there.<p>You can’t appreciate a feat of organization until you experience the disorganization. But it’s hard to have the patience to wrap your head around a disorganized mess that you don’t care about. Only if the disorganized mess is your responsibility, something that means more to you than a case study, can you wrap your head around it and appreciate improvements. This means that while you can learn algorithmic wizardry through homework assignments, you’re unlikely to learn organization skills unless you work on a large project you care about, most likely because you’re paid to care about it.",1434987426

That&#x27;s very young compared to the rest of the solar system other than Earth. It appears to have undergone a more-or-less complete resurfacing at around that time.<p>In addition to volcanoes, there are a number of topographic features consistent with relatively recent deformation (basically, lots of big cracks and some compressional wrinkles). However, there are no clear plate boundaries as Earth has.<p>The current thought is that Venus&#x27;s deformation and volcanism is directly driven by mantle convection.  Earth&#x27;s plate tectonics is actually mostly subduction driven.  There&#x27;s a lot of horizontal motion of plates on Earth.  On Venus, there&#x27;s not a huge amount of horizontal motion on the surface (there&#x27;s clearly no subduction on Venus).  The thought is that there&#x27;s no athenosphere (very weak, thin layer in the mantle with 1%-5% melt) on Venus to allow large horizontal motions.<p>Interestingly, Venus might be a decent analouge to what pre-plate-tectonic Earth was like. (That part is just my speculation, and I&#x27;m not a planetary geologist, so take it with a grain of salt.)  Proper plate tectonics probably didn&#x27;t begin on Earth until around 2 billion years ago (the details are still hotly debated).  Prior to this time, subduction doesn&#x27;t seem to be occuring, and there&#x27;s not much evidence for large horizontal motion.<p>At any rate, this is just another piece of evidence that Venus&#x27;s volcanism is still at least somewhat active today, as opposed to all dating to ~300Ma.<p>Incidentally, I just realized that there&#x27;s a GSA Today article from last year that (briefly) summarizes Venus&#x27;s geology.  GSA Today articles are meant to be very easily readable and only semi-technical (i.e. assumes only general geologic knowledge).

The efficiency in terms of water or thermal energy is not stated, but is likely similar to drinking birds, which have a thermal efficiency around 0.01%.

I mean that in a very literal way -- it has lots of stuff that can not be made sense of because it lacks context or any actual meaning.<p>> I stress to my patients and the parents of my patients that if you can’t hear anything going on around you when listening to headphones, the decibel level is too high.<p>This is just stupid.  It ignores type of headphone entirely.  IEMs like the ER-4P (<a href=""https://www.etymotic.com/consumer/earphones/er4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.etymotic.com/consumer/earphones/er4.html</a>) have insane noise isolation (up to 42 dB).  When using them, I can&#x27;t hear someone talking to me, standing right next to me, with no music!  They physical block the ear canal and create a seal blocking outside noise.<p>> As a rule of thumb, you should only use [personal audio] devices at levels up to 60% of maximum volume for a total of 60 minutes a day. The louder the volume, the shorter your duration should be. At maximum volume, you should listen for only about five minutes a day.<p>Again, idiotic.  &quot;60%&quot; is entirely meaningless.  It might as well be &quot;Don&#x27;t listen above FALASFDABURAGA&quot;.  Headphones vary in sensitivity vastly, on some sets of IEMs -- 60% would be ear bleeding, deafeningly, painfully loud.  On a high impedance, low sensitivity set of big headphones, 60% is a whisper.  As a &quot;rule of thumb&quot; all it does is reinforce that the person who gave that quote is an idiot.<p>> If you listen to music with earbuds or headphones at levels that block out normal discourse, you are in effect dealing lethal blows to the hair cells in your ears.<p>... again, quotes from people who have no understanding that there are different types of headphones.  MAYBE you could claim with fully open headphones this to be the case... but what is the level of &quot;discourse&quot;... <i>sigh</i>.  Again, literally nonsense because it is impossible to make sense of...<p>> ... Music Is Distracting (entire section) ...<p>There exists multiple categories of music WITHOUT WORDS!  Shocking I know.

While presently F1 cars are certainly arbitrarily restricted by rules, several of his design decisions strike me as just as bad.<p>For instance, the open-wheel design is going to create tons of pressure drag. If you were designing a car from the ground up for speed, I sincerely doubt they would not have the aero kit cover the wheels.<p>More than that, the open-wheel design is also dangerous, because if the tyres touch the results are often catastrophic, with the cars flying into the air and the flailing tyres creating a tremendous hazard.

9758872,comment,9755715,9755715,0,0,jdietrich,,,"A major point is being missed here, and it is fundamental to how F1 cars evolve - rules lawyering.<p>It&#x27;s fairly easy to design a car that is safe, fast and looks good. It is fiendishly difficult to create a set of rules that enforce those outcomes on designers. Unless F1 becomes a one-design formula, it is always going to have to deal with the cat-and-mouse game between the governing body and creative designers.<p>The obvious recent example is that of the ugly noses of 2014[1]. The nose height of F1 cars had been gradually increasing over the years, as teams realised that there was an aerodynamic advantage in channelling air under the nose. The FIA became concerned about the safety of these noses, and the risk that in a side impact they might over-ride the cockpit and hit a driver in the helmet.<p>The rule introduced to address this issue stated that an area of the nose no less than 90cm² must be centred no higher than 185mm above the car floor. Designers immediately realised that this rule could be exploited by simply having a 90cm² protuberance hanging below the main nose, minimising the constriction of airflow. These droopy proboscises weren&#x27;t anticipated or desired, but they were an inevitable consequence of a rule that wasn&#x27;t absolutely watertight and the competitive pressures or racing.<p>The modern era of F1 is practically defined by these creative interpretations of the rules - F- and S-ducts, exhaust blown and double diffusers, blown starter holes, tuned mass dampers. No matter what rule the FIA draws up, some very smart people will figure out a way around it. Adrian Newey, the greatest designer in the history of the sport, is fond of saying that &quot;there is no such thing as the spirit of the rules&quot;. To many, that buccaneering spirit is an integral part of Formula 1.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.sanantoniof1club.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2014-F1-race-car-nose-review-proboscis-ugly.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sanantoniof1club.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/2...</a>",1434986066

If you actually try to go down the road of building a platform for other developers then you are very quickly going to discover that you need to build a bunch of other stuff totally separate from the core messaging service. You are going to need solutions for getting data in/out, dashboards, billing systems, sample code -- on and on. Plus you have to provide an SLA to close any meaningful business. And you&#x27;ll need a pro sales team to get those opportunities interested and through the funnel. We are 35 people and I could easily keep another 5 engineers fully loaded to attack the roadmap as aggressively as we&#x27;d like. And we&#x27;ve been at this for 2 years. There&#x27;s a lot of surface area and you need to be very good on both technical and sales dimensions to make a platform play work.<p>My best advice for you is to either find a unique value prop in the consumer space where you can perhaps gain a foothold and access virality or focus on finding a nice home for your engineering team and technology. I&#x27;ve seen a lot of advice here about how you should start consulting to create runway. This is terrible advice and you should face  reality. Nobody is going to build an app and a business on top of a messaging platform that is a part time project of a handful of developers without any runway. It&#x27;s just not a rational business decision and nobody who is capable of paying you real money would make that call. You are in a market with existing well funded players that are rapidly evolving their product and addressing that market through sales and marketing. You either have to build something that you can give away for free and generate traction that you can raise money against or you need to focus on selling the core assets that you do have: the people and the tech. You may want to reconsider releasing that code if you want a shot at an aquihire outcome. Best of luck.",1434985968

For me, whenever I start a project from scratch I usually start with the most dynamic environment I can find, then hack away until I have something that resembles the functionality I need, before locking it down. In the beginning of a project I don&#x27;t care if something is 100% correct, I just want to see what my idea looks like, and what I actually need. I don&#x27;t want to deal with synchronizing my types with a database schema, or make sure the JSON I send to the server satisfy the type system. I really don&#x27;t care about interfaces or abstract classes or whatnot, I just want to retrieve the value I know to be in the object I got. Then, when I have a working&#x27;ish prototype, I can start nailing it down with types, assertions, tests and contracts.<p>Of course, people are different. Some people do all of this on paper before writing a single line of code. Others plan by making types and interfaces, then proceed to implement those. I just like making prototypes.",1434985702

With `1/0`, it uses `Double` because `(/)` requires a Fractional type.<p>Also, partial functions like `head` or `fromJust` can burn you:<p><pre><code>    λ head []

The latter is a legacy behavior that is generally considered undesirable. The former is more debatable; some would say that you should avoid integer division by an unknown value as much as possible.<p>In Haskell, exceptions in non-IO code (other than deliberate hard crashes) are generally considered a wart to be avoided and mitigated as much as possible (because they interfere with functional programming).",1434985700
