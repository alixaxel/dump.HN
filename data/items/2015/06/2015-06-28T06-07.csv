I started delving into react and flux, but when trying to do personal &quot;real world&quot; projects it seems like there is no end of unsupported opinion on every aspect -- disregarding the confusing levels of ES6 adoption across examples (ranging from no ES6 features used to &quot;this isn&#x27;t even ES7 yet&quot;), It seems like everyone has a different answer for where to throw in a new abstraction. I still don&#x27;t know what dispatcher to use, if I should even use a package. And the frameworks, they&#x27;re all advertised &quot;lightweight&quot; swiss army knives of code, but I can&#x27;t really figure out objectively why one should even be used in the first place.<p>It seems that there are a dozen implementations of every idea with a slight change here or there.

9792661,comment,9792400,9792400,0,0,conjecTech,,,"I think this is just a very clever form of price discrimination. In my experience, there are two disjoint groups of McDonald&#x27;s patrons, those who order off the combo menu and those who order off the dollar menu. The combo menu doesn&#x27;t have a 20 piece option and the dollar menu doesn&#x27;t have a 10 piece option. I think this plays into why they are also visually at opposite ends of the display. The people who are looking at the combo menu are far less price conscious to begin with, and an order of 20 nuggets is going to seem overkill of you are working under the assumption that your meal is going to include a drink and a large portion of fries. However, if you are the kind that mentally debates whether you should shell out the extra dollar for a drink, you might be more than willing to forego the fries for an extra portion of protein.<p>I&#x27;ve found similar tricks are used in vending machines, particularly with the different varieties of crackers. Inevitably, there will be one set near the top of the machine with other expensive items and priced according. However, there is also a half row of ever so slightly different ones further down priced at 2/3 the price.<p>It&#x27;s all just a matter of satisfying the demand that exists at lower price levels without having to lower the price for everyone. Setting prices using price elasticity assumes you can only offer a single price to all parties. However, cost-conscious shoppers are already going to spend more mental cycles looking for a good deal. By making the more desirable pricing just a little hard to find, you can give them a better deal without butchering your overall profit margin.",1435473524
