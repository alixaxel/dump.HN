9705551,comment,9705098,9705098,0,0,janpieterz,,,"You don&#x27;t really control the composition that closely. The whole point of having a lot of microservices is that you can update and work on very isolated functionality at a time distributed.<p>As other people have noted as well in here, you should always keep the interface backwards compatible, if needed make a second version of the API or the messages, but never really have to deploy more than a couple of services who really have changed their behavior. The ones just interacting with those services should experience the same interface, being it a couple of versions older or newer.<p>I&#x27;d recommend watching the ucon videos [1] or Udi Dahan&#x27;s Advanced Distributed Systems design [2] for more in-depth reference material. If you&#x27;re transforming a team of engineers I can really advise you to join the latter and afterwards order the videos so you can use them with your team as training material! This is less about microservices as them being micro, but more about setting up a distributed service oriented architecture.<p>[1] <a href=""https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6312-mucon#skillscasts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://skillsmatter.com/conferences/6312-mucon#skillscasts</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.udidahan.com/training/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.udidahan.com/training/</a>",1434113919

Incrementally it&#x27;s quite cheap to toss one more of widget X on the pile when you have a room full of widget X experts.<p>If you decide widget Y is now the way to go, you get to answer all the questions already answered for widget X: Who supports it? How? How to do we back it up and restore it?  Who can tune queries?  How does this differ from our build patterns for servers that host X?  Can the two live on the same machine or are there potential conflicts? Etc.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong - with proper planning you can educate the X guys on how to support Y and smoothly add it or even transition to it.

This is a conceptual error. There is no such thing as &quot;the application as a whole&quot;. There is only the currently-deployed set of services, and their versions.<p>You should have a build, test, and deploy pipeline (i.e. continuous deployment) which is triggered on any commit to master of any service. The &quot;test&quot; part should include system/integration tests for all services, deployed into a staging environment. If all tests pass, the service that triggered the commit can rolled out to production.

Perception bias. The only time you&#x27;ll hear about CPS is in a case like this, when the agent is on a power trip and oversteps his bounds. You never hear about the success stories, where they intervene to save a child, or are successful in getting a family therapy.<p>I can speak from experience here, I have dealt with CPS. When I was notified they would be visiting our house, I did some research. I read the horror stories, and I learned a key detail: CPS is not a policing agency. The threats of taking your children from you and throwing you in jail are idle: only police and judges can do that. When you deal with CPS, only let them in your house if they agree to be recorded. If they refuse, or their supervisor objects, don&#x27;t let them in. Unless they have a warrant, you are under NO obligation to deal with them. (Bear in mind, though, the courts will probably side with CPS)<p>But I digress. My experience with the social worker was that she was just as nervous in dealing with me as I was with her, but she was genuinely interested in understanding and offering assistance. She asked a few questions, held a follow up visit, and that was the end of it.",1434112828

I&#x27;ve seen retailer after retailer try to implement improvements to consumer experience (either through beacons and directed coupons or through some sort of identity recognition) only to be met with ENORMOUS backlash [1] from consumers freaking out because the store can tell where they are in the store at any given time. In security, iris recognition, voice recognition, and facial recognition are all methods of identification that cannot be stolen and yet all are methods of identification that freak people out to no end. <i>They&#x27;d rather carry around an ID that can be stolen, copied, and sold on the black market thus ruining their financial livelihood for the rest of their lives than switch over to a more reliable biometric based method of identification</i><p>Privacy as we knew it is dead. It died a long time ago; hell you could probably argue that it started to die the first time anyone published a phone book because if I knew your name then I could figure out where you lived. Biometrics, to me, is a recapturing of privacy and personal identification because you no longer have to worry about relying on third parties to protect your identity  (which is obviously not working [2]), YOU ARE YOUR IDENTITY. Your face, your voice, your fingerprint, your iris, all of these things cannot be spoofed and are uniquely yours <i>and cannot be taken away from you</i>.<p>As for the article, this is a perfect example of the kinds of things that require a reinvention of the notion of privacy. Used to be if you were captured on camera in public no one knew who you were unless someone you knew saw that picture and could identify you. Now with facial recognition, that&#x27;s not possible anymore. But Pandora&#x27;s box has been opened and it cannot be shut again so articles like this just seem totally pointless in light of that- they&#x27;re missing the fundamental issue that facial recognition is a thing that exists and it&#x27;s not going to stop existing just because we&#x27;re all unsure how we feel about it. Yes I <i>absolutely</i> agree that facial recognition needs to be an opt-in where it can be, like on Facebook or Twitter or whatever. However we&#x27;re living in a time when absolute right to privacy and anonymity in public no longer exists, and we need to figure out how to navigate that fast or else all of this biometric technology that can and should be used to make life easier is going to be regulated all to hell and we&#x27;ll be stuck in paranoia-ville and afraid to leave our homes.<p>[1]<a href=""http://consumerist.com/2013/05/10/nordstrom-decides-to-stop-tracking-customers-smartphones/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://consumerist.com/2013/05/10/nordstrom-decides-to-stop-...</a>

They&#x27;re not there to pose any serious challenge to the protagonist; they&#x27;re there to make the protagonist look good. He gets to show off, get the crowd on his side, and win. Later on, once their reputations are higher, they&#x27;ll go up against serious contenders. The journeymen, of course, will go up against the next crop of up-and-comers.<p>Still, the fact that this exists means that boxing has a serious problem - their version of the minor leagues has such a dearth of talent that they have to resort to this WWE-style entertainment to make a name for themselves. You don&#x27;t see this with MMA; there are enough people willing to fight earnestly that they don&#x27;t need it.",1434111086

Do you, whatever race you are?<p>You and Russ are presuming that you have any idea what thoughts and mental calculus goes through a black person&#x27;s mind when they decide when and how hard to work on what, and that you could even know or deduce it without asking, and that it&#x27;s the same for all black people, and that there&#x27;s a difference between how black and white people think, which rules and formula they use, and which numbers they plug into them.<p>Don&#x27;t you see how condescending it is for a white man (or anyone) to lecture black people (or anyone) about how they think and why they behave, presuming to know better about the cause of their problems, explicitly calling them lazy as a class, acting like he&#x27;s doing them a favor by justifying their laziness?

And it&#x27;s not just that his arguments are &quot;badly written&quot;, it&#x27;s also that his assumptions and logic are deeply flawed.<p>My theory: Russ was just inexpertly trying to ape Eric Raymond&#x27;s favorite rhetorical tactic, and he failed miserably.
