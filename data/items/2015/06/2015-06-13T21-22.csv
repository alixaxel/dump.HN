9712843,comment,9711346,9712766,0,0,jdreaver,,,"<i>This</i> is the naive comment. It takes a lot of effort to start a company and make money off of something, even if you didn&#x27;t make the original version. If people are willing to pay millions of dollars for software, and someone comes along and builds something that fits that demand, then why shouldn&#x27;t they?<p>Some people make software for fun, or to help others. If my software helps someone make millions, then cool, good for them. Personally, I would certainly monetize free software I made if I saw the opportunity. However, some people might already be wealthy and want to play with their kids or something instead of chasing a new startup opportunity, so they shouldn&#x27;t care if someone else makes millions off of their software. You are acting very arrogant when you assume everyone&#x27;s values line up with yours.",1434232742

Lawns are a smaller problem, but are truly a complete waste, with no productive value given in return.<p>If we removed the smaller problem of lawns, and gave that water to the farmers, their water restrictions would not be as bad, which will have a direct result on their production, which has a direct result on food prices, which has a direct result on everybody, in particular lower incomes families.<p>So I really do stand by my statement that as long as people are watering their green lawns, we&#x27;re not pursuing the optimal solution.<p>I should make myself clear, though - farmers don&#x27;t get a free pass to use all the water they want. They should be pursuing more efficient irrigation methods, and plating foods that require less water. Then the cuts won&#x27;t have as strong of an impact.",1434230716

I used to spend a lot of time focusing on the architecture design of these things, building in microservices using the latest technology wherever possible. I figured this was the best way to go about it, until the day I realized I was spending 50% of my time trying to set up a distributed microservices environment, 40% of my time fighting with the tools I was trying to use to build my prototype, and 10% of my time actually building my prototype.<p>This is the biggest problem with trying to scale too early - you take the focus away from your product. The reality is that most businesses will not work out. Instead of focusing on scaling something that may never sell, you should use the tools that allow you to iterate on your product as quickly as possible - where reasonable.<p>As stated above, if you end up needing to grow the business, all the code will eventually be rewritten. The data, however, will likely be much more expensive to change. Put some time into thinking about your data model, but otherwise focus on building your product.",1434229643

Finally, there seems to be traction with FTTx providers, but this seems limited to affluent pockets of a few thousand people in the country. All the new fibre offerings serve the same locations.<p>While it&#x27;s hopeful this will improve the situation in the medium-term, the backhaul from ISP to eyeball is oversubscribed at least 30:1 for ADSL, with equipment being replaced by (IMO) inferior network equipment. Additionally, there are reports of automated line-conditioning software which should improve local loop connectivity, but I&#x27;ve seen DSL sync issues only since the software has been implemented.<p>The (ex-public, privatised under Telkom) Exchanges have been neglected and have recently been divided into three groups: Earners, Maintainers and &quot;Lost Causes&quot;. The latter two will not receive upgrades from ADSL1 and the Earners will likely migrate to newer technologies. This is largely due to copper-theft and vandalism of exchanges/cellular base-stations (which are oversubscribed enough that wireless technologies routinely sustain 3000-20000ms latencies). The oligopoly running cellular networks have no incentive to improve this, since the Regulatory Authorities don&#x27;t really seem to push competition as well as we&#x27;d like.<p>TL;DR: There are issues, but rose-tinted glasses make me hopeful in the medium term. Claims are that wireless will fix everything seem bleak, since base stations become oversubscribed faster than they can be built/upgraded (and the backhaul from them is measured in megabits/s, rather than gigabits/s charged at ~US$0.15/MB).",1434229263
