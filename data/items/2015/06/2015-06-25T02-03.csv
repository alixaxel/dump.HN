The source code of every programming language is an AST literal, and in principle every language can have macros by allowing compile-time AST to AST functions.<p>It makes perfect sense. Yes, the source code of every language is an AST literal, but it matters a great deal for metaprogramming how close it is to its internal structure.<p>> The only thing special about Lisp is that the AST is a list, whose operations are familiar to the programmer. With other languages the programmer has to learn some specialized API to write macros. The advantage of Lisp macros is that they are easier to write (than say, Scala macros), but this extra expressing power is enabled by having macros themselves instead of having &quot;homoiconity&quot;.<p>Who are you disagreeing with? I don&#x27;t think anyone has said macros are impossible in languages other than Lisp.<p>You are also contradicting yourself here, because &quot;expressive power&quot; and &quot;easier to write&quot; are not independent.",1435200289

9775627,comment,9775159,9775460,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Incidentally, &quot;trading price * number of shares&quot; almost always understates the selling price when a public company is bought, and it almost always overstates the selling price when a company is liquidated (technically, shares are worth zero when a company is liquidated, but I mean how the share-price usually free-falls in a very short period right before a firesale).  The reason for this is that trading price, by definition, is set by the most marginal buyers and sellers, those who most want to get rid of their shares or most want to acquire new shares.  The <i>actual</i> shareholder body consists of a large range of individuals with a large range of selling prices.  To acquire a full company, a buyer needs to start convincing less marginal shareholders to sell, and usually needs to pay a premium (sometimes up to 50% over market cap).  To get rid of a company that has suddenly started heading for bankruptcy, shareholders need to sell into a market of much less willing buyers, and so they need to offer a significant discount.",1435199555

That said, bytecode generation was never the major issue, though I did find some cases where seemingly identical implementations would be faster/slower in one compiler or the other.<p>Much more troubling:<p>- Some Scala idioms are just not as performant as the naive java implementations.  Function passing can create lots of objects for instance.<p>- Some of Scala&#x27;s &quot;magic&quot; features that allow for terse-ness can behind the scenes cause performance issues, that you might not expect without a clear understanding of what is going on.  Implicit conversions for instance can also create tons of garbage.<p>- The Scala collections library, while improving some, has lots of performance gotchas.  Collections that don&#x27;t match modern hardware or implicit conversions that de-optimize operations can happen pretty easily.<p>Personally, I would choose Java over Scala if any of the following were true:<p>- You were going to have many different versions of your software in the wild.<p>- You had a constrained release cycle.<p>- You intended for artifacts to exist for long periods without change.<p>- You had specific backwards compatibility requirements.<p>- You had a large team.<p>- You had a team of highly varying skill sets.<p>That is to say, I&#x27;d only pick Scala if I were working on a project where I controlled the life cycle of the product, releases were common, backwards compatibility was not an issue, and my team was small, cohesive and experienced.<p>If those things weren&#x27;t true, I might not pick Java, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t pick Scala.",1435199188

I&#x27;d argue &#x27;yes&#x27;, in the same sense that you could <i>depend</i> on some model or factory in OO land.  The leap is in the paradigm, functional vs OO.<p>Behaviors in BEST are a functional programming construct—they <i>project</i> streams of data into a return value.  Note that Behaviors are automatically re-evaluated every time one of their dependent States change, which introduces this &#x27;stream&#x27; functionality.<p>I&#x27;d argue that these streams are dependencies and that they&#x27;re being injected into these functions (hence DI,) but honestly, at this point we&#x27;re just bike-shedding about terminology :-).<p>I <i>do</i> want to make sure, though, that this functionality is properly communicated, as the State-Behavior relationship is the crux of our framework&#x27;s design.",1435197657
