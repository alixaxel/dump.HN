It doesn&#x27;t catch everything, and sometimes gives false positives, but it is quite amazing how it visualizes problems in the program flow, going through several levels in the call hierarchy, following variable assignments over function calls, etc... in a few cases I was convinced that a problem was a false positive until I really took the time to understand what the static analyzer is trying to tell me and it turned out to be actual bugs.<p>In my opinion it is mostly poor integration into the coding workflow, and poor visualization of the analyzer warnings that lead to too little use of static code analysis, and another is a too wide-spread &#x27;if it works at all, ship it&#x27; mentality.",1435309199

  $ ls
  $ cd /home/bar
  $ ls
</code></pre>
If your PATH contained &quot;.useful_stuff/tools&quot; and the user bar happened to have a file called &quot;/home/bar/.useful_stuff/tools/ls&quot;, that file has now been executed instead of /bin/ls, with your privileges. Your account has now been compromised.<p>Try this:<p><pre><code>  [ptx@hn downloads]$ python3 -c &#x27;print(&quot;hello&quot;)&#x27;
  hello
  [ptx@hn downloads]$ export PYTHONPATH=&quot;./.pip&quot;
  [ptx@hn downloads]$ python3 -c &#x27;print(&quot;hello&quot;)&#x27;

  hello
  [ptx@hn downloads]$ cat .pip/site.py 
  print(&quot;You have been owned! Have a nice day.&quot;)

It catched a few things I overlooked, I learned a couple of things (example: it&#x27;s useless to define a var inside a loop) but it&#x27;s also very opinionated and insisted that I write code in a way that pleases its author. I had to refactor working code to make most of the warnings go away. I ended up with something that worked as well as the original but was much more complicated to read (at least for me). I stopped using it and regretted making all those changes to the code. There are some configuration switches but nothing that could make it work for me. I should check jshint but unfortunately jslint primed me against that kind of tools.<p>I prefer to catch errors with tests and test coverage tools.

9783057,comment,9781725,9782859,0,0,crdb,,,"Why should there be an end game? The history of human civilization is one of constant progress, with leaps so large they are almost impossible to imagine by previous generations. Imagine telling someone from the era of ocean liners that in less than a century, his descendants would be routinely flying across continents in hours for the price of a few meals, with safety levels so high it is massively more dangerous for them to take a taxi to work. Imagine the surprise of the world upon discovering nuclear weapons in 1945, the hope that came from knowing it was a clean and seemingly endless source of power. Or look at Asimov: he was a prescient writer in many respects, probably one of the if not the greatest SF writer there was, but his works completely ignore the connectivity that is pervasive today (when the NSA taps every phone and reads every email automatically, when they can recognize your face even turned, from a million CCTV cameras whose feed is parsed in real time, you can&#x27;t have plots with people running away in cities undetected).<p>The most exciting part of working in technology in general, and software in particular, is that you get to be at - or at least better understand - the cutting edge and see those changes before they become more broadly accepted. For example, machine translation used to be cutting edge AI research in top secret intelligence projects, yet today you can translate entire webpages in Chrome with right click -> &quot;Translate to English&quot;. For free. Hell, your portable Star Trek-like computer can take a photo of the Japanese menu for you and convert it to something understandable, then translate your response back to Japanese for your waiter. The Babel Fish is real! Given a bit more time, some better brain-computer interfaces and a larger corpus, we might well be able to converse in any language without learning it...<p>Software is this generation&#x27;s equivalent to steels and mechanical engineering during the Industrial Revolution, and nuclear weapons and power in the 20th century - we have conquered the physical realm pretty thoroughly but have only made baby steps in knowledge compared to what is possible. Even neuroscientists will admit we know relatively little about how the brain really works. Just look at statistical learning: the field has only really blossomed in the last 15 years or so.<p>The reason for proprietary software and IP is always the same: to generate via extremely expensive R&D leaps in knowledge and products that allow the researching company to reap outsized returns. Yesterday, it was operating systems and office suites. Today, it&#x27;s applications that need things like massive GPU clusters for deep learning, or knowing how to scale complex services (like Google Image Search) to billions of users, or weak AI (self-driving cars). I would love nothing more than a glimpse to the technology of 2060 or 2600, although I doubt I would be able to grasp even a fraction of what it represents. Just knowing the problems they are trying to solve then, would be fascinating.",1435308658

Of course, logical bugs don&#x27;t get caught by static typing. But it helps a lot when refactoring code, or collaborating on the same codebase with many people, or changing someone else&#x27;s code.

Lifetime employment has all but disappeared. The 2008 financial crisis has shaken people&#x27;s faith in housing as a safe investment. You don&#x27;t want to tie up a large percentage of your net worth in an illiquid asset that doesn&#x27;t gain much value, especially if you need to be able to pick up your stuff and move across the country at any time. Therefore, renting is the rational choice for us.<p>The problem is what to do when you&#x27;re old. If you happen to own a 5-bedroom house, you can rent out a part of it or sell it and move to a smaller house. In either case, you&#x27;ll have enough income to enjoy a comfy retirement. Owning a home, in that sense, is like having a massive savings account.<p>Renters can get the same benefit if they save up a lot of money or invest smartly, but that takes more discipline than just making mortgage payments each month.

I am developing static code analysis tools for Python myself (<a href=""https://www.quantifiedcode.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quantifiedcode.com</a>) and have thought a lot about this problem as well. Since we offer a SaaS solution instead of an IDE plugin the boundary conditions are a bit different for us (e.g. we have less strict &quot;realtime&quot; requirements but the feedback time is also longer), but the basic question is the same: Why doesn&#x27;t everyone use static analysis to improve their code?<p>After having surveyed most of the available static analysis tools I think that part of the answer is that often the tools simply do not provide enough value for developers, especially those analyzing dynamic languages like Python / Ruby / Javascript (for C++/Java the tooling is much better). We are currently trying to change that by developing a new, data-driven approach to code analysis, which (we hope) should improve the quality of the analyses quite a bit and provide better and more actionable feedback.<p>Part of the problem is also cultural of course: People have different ideas about what &quot;good code&quot; is and they usually do not like having their code critiqued. Using an automated tool rather than manual code review to check some aspects of code quality can be beneficial though, since it is normally easier to accept harsh feedback from a machine than a human.",1435306728
