Sadly, whitelisting that site in uBlock actually does <i>28 sites</i> a solid[1].

Agricultural farming drives demand for labor intensive organic produce. This process of more wealth driving demand for higher quality goods and services, in turn driving demand for more labor is <i>just as inevitable</i> as automation.<p>If it weren&#x27;t, automating the agricultural sector would have resulted in 95% unemployment in the early 20th century. It didn&#x27;t.<p>Unless you <i>artificially</i> repress demand by stripping wealth from people (a process that requires corruption), demand for labor won&#x27;t dry up.<p>But, the government and our financial sector <i>is</i> doing that.

It&#x27;s the only way... at least if we want a future that is actually good for more than ~10% of the human race.</i><p>Basic income is one of two ways of realizing a future that is good for <i>everyone</i> (and those ~10% won&#x27;t be happy without it because the zombies will be at their door). The other way is to make everything free (either forcefully, or through price reductions via technology and automation).<p>Basic income is known to work [1]. &quot;Making everything free&quot; forcefully is a no-go because it disrespects the realities of market dynamics (as we&#x27;ve learned from Communism).<p>It is important also to realize that there are <i>many</i> ways of implementing BI, and some of them are better than others. This is a debate and discussion we should be all having.<p>The primary ethical decision I see is whether BI is implemented in a coercive manner (i.e. taxation) or a voluntary manner. Both approaches are possible and each can be done in various different ways. I worked on something called <a href=""http://groupcurrency.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groupcurrency.org</a> [2], a voluntary cryptocurrency approach to basic income, and there are many other approaches as well, the simplest of which is simply for a &quot;company-tribe&quot; to guarantee its members a minimum income (backed by the fruits of their collective labor).<p>For those interested in Basic Income, I strongly recommend perusing the subreddit r/basicincome and related subreddits (r/CryptoUBI, etc.).<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome/wiki/index#wiki_that.27s_all_very_well.2C_but_where.27s_the_evidence.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/basicincome/wiki/index#wiki_that.27...</a><p>[2] HN thread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9501059"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9501059</a>",1434005897

I didn&#x27;t know a gen_server manages code loading like this, thank you for that.<p>An upgrade doesn&#x27;t involve only the in-memory state per process though. It also involves state outside the process, like state on disk. Even if each process upgrades it&#x27;s own state (I&#x27;m assuming the gen_server isn&#x27;t limited to in-memory state; I don&#x27;t know), an old process accessing from disk a data structure that differs from the one used by the new process isn&#x27;t safe. You can&#x27;t just upgrade old processes in stages.<p>An upgrade can also involve multiple processes. It&#x27;s hard to upgrade all of them at once. As you mentioned, in the hardest case of all, a distributed system, loading in stages may be the only option, provided the system was explicitly designed such that old and new processes can coexist without safety issues.<p><a href=""http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/upgrades/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pmg.csail.mit.edu/upgrades/</a>",1434005821

Mining could be done on a single laptop by one person for all the protocol cares.<p>Lets say that 99.9% percentage of the miners decided not to go along with a hard fork, and 0.1% did, effectively bitcoin would be split up into 2 networks, A and B.<p>Functionally, they would be nearly equivalent, ignoring network lag. As a user you could even have two clients, one that accepts transactions for network A, and one for network B. And your wallet in network A could even have a different balance than in network B. So how do you decide which wallet is correct?<p>The same way everyone else does, by mass consensus, ie. by what everyone else is using. Ex, if you wanted to buy stuff from merchant X, and they had a network B wallet, it wouldn&#x27;t matter how many miners were mining on network A, would it?<p>Miners <i>only</i> provide security against a double spend 51% attack and that&#x27;s it. By their very nature, they also are in the best position to do a 51% attack. Therefore the only leverage they have is they could threaten the new network. But as I was explaining before, if they attack network B, it goes to show that network A is nearly as vulnerable as network B is.<p>In other words, its as centralized as fiat, which destroys one of the most highly touted features of Bitcoin as a currency of the people. If a couple of a bad actors (ie the people running the mining warehouses), can destroy it, either because of government coercion or by their own free will, then as you can see, Bitcoin is like the emperor who has no clothes. It could be destroyed at any time.<p>So, we have a MAD situation (Mutually Assured Destruction). If the users force the miners hand too much, the miners could retaliate, by destroying bitcoin by executing a 51% attack. But of course, as long as the miners are making money, they don&#x27;t want to do that.<p>Nobody invested in the bitcoin wants anyone to know this, the users nor the miners, because it goes against their best interest to show the weakness of the currency they own.<p>However, the longer this draws on, the more people will wake up and see that Bitcoin is truly becoming centralized into something that resembled Beenz and Floodz from the 90&#x27;s.

I&#x27;d previously thought that Japan would come up with a new solution. Their housing bubble popped in 1989 and put Japan into recession.  The US hit that problem in 2008.  But Japan never came up with a good solution - they had a 20 year recession.  What they did do is put money into infrastructure projects, and improve their safety net.  So, while there&#x27;s less forward progress, life for the average Japanese has not become worse.<p>From the article: <i>&quot;43 percent of Chinese workers already consider themselves to be overeducated for their current positions.&quot;</i> Only about half of new Chinese college graduates find jobs that require a college education.  As in the US, the education industry has saturated the market for educated people.<p>China&#x27;s government has more options than the US does.  The government has built over 100 new large cities, for example.  Some of them were empty at first, but they&#x27;re getting better at starting them up.  Now they do the construction, finish that, stock and staff the retail stores, start up the transportation system and services, and then, with all the services available and underutilized, get people and businesses to move in.  This seems inefficient but turns out to work better than trying to do it in profitable stages.  It&#x27;s a communist system, remember; it doesn&#x27;t have to make money immediately.<p>China&#x27;s government will probably not ignore the problem.  The US has a sizable lobby that takes the position that the free market somehow makes the decisions about how things work, how much things cost, and who gets paid how much. China does not have that.

For privatization of roads to exist, the gov&#x27;t would have to give up its monopoly on their provision first, but the problem is much deeper than just this one unlikelihood.<p>You mention that if TWC/Comcast/etc. are given state-granted monopolies, why not, of course, ought they not be regulated? If I have a broken knee, why not get a doctor to fix it?<p>If I have a broken knee and it became this way because of the widespread acceptance of a legal order where nobody is punished for brandishing tire irons and kneecapping, the problem, then, really lies with this legal order. As an anarchist libertarian, I hope that one day governments worldwide will be abolished and until such time will work toward solutions for the problems to come from the inevitable insurrection of the &quot;great&quot; Western democracies.<p>My position is so unpopular, and so many people now are unable to consider that maybe democracy isn&#x27;t such a great thing or that gov&#x27;t shouldn&#x27;t have its paws on healthcare, education, etc. I certainly don&#x27;t suggest a step backwards toward feudalism or some sort of dictatorship, but you ought to keep in mind that besides the US, democracy before WW1 was only in 2 European countries.<p>I really do share the sentiments of those indoctrinated by statism, to want to see peace and prosperity, children be educated, the elderly having healthcare and so on, I just disagree with the technical (legal and economic) approach.<p>If one can overcome the idea that government MUST do X/Y/Z in order for civil order to be maintained or a good/service to be provided (and these ideas are often easily disproven by historical examples), then it can at least be a fun thought experiment.<p>So, to answer your question on multiplying roads we&#x27;ll imagine that somehow the US gov&#x27;t has been abolished. All the roads now would have a legal status of being unowned. Private companies could branch off roads but not just swoop in and toss up roadblocks or tollbooths. The reason here, and similar logic applies to public parks and other municipal monopolies, is that citizens have been granted easement rights to travel the roads.<p>Assuming the citizen is not a criminal member of the political elite, there&#x27;s no reason to be able to take away these easement rights to travel. Companies could begin a very slow process of homesteading or coming to own the previously public roads by making improvements, patrolling for drunk drivers, etc.<p>For a road company to succeed, given that they can&#x27;t just extract tolls from easement rightsholders, they&#x27;d have to add some value like as mentioned with fixing potholes, you&#x27;d probably see some expansions like the original ideas for I-70 in Baltimore, then there would probably be some bundling in with auto insurers and DRO&#x27;s (&quot;dispute resolution organizations&quot;, which could be for- or non-profit police and judges basically).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_70_in_Maryland#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_70_in_Maryland#Histo...</a>",1434003659

The rise of the middle-class began in the early 20th century and peaked in the 1970s and since then we have been sliding back into a feudal order where the 5%, 1%, 0.1% or whatever effectively control all of the wealth and power and the remaining 90%+ owe fealty to their regional feudal overlord.<p>This is not to say a return to a feudal order is inevitable but various flavors of feudalism served as the west&#x27;s default social and political structure for thousands of years before democracy made its appearance.<p>I suspect reality will sink in if or, rather, when, an economic catastrophe precipitates a breakdown in the social and/or political order and the standard of living falls out from underneath the citizens of today&#x27;s prosperous nations and mass unemployment, hunger, deprivation and violence become tangible and inescapable.

9697914,comment,9696754,9696754,0,0,vessenes,,,"I have a fairly reductionist view on this, one I think is helpful, so here goes.<p>First, I think of almost all large-scale Bitcoin arguments as religious. Especially if you&#x27;re an outsider to Bitcoin, it will probably help you to think of them that way, too.<p>People come to a belief, and then back-fill plausible arguments all the time. When there are vigorous debates like this in Bitcoin land, we usually have some strongly held underlying beliefs coming to conflict.<p>I would say the holy war here revolves around a single axiom on each side: the &quot;Small Block&quot; camp fundamentally believes that there is a sort of inflation that happens when block sizes grow. Just like they believed that increased adoption would increase Bitcoin prices, they believe at some level that increased scarcity for block slots will increase transaction fees, and that the system relies on this promise to maintain its integrity.<p>The &quot;Large Block&quot; camp fundamentally believes that the value in the protocol comes from cheap, large-scale transaction support, and that artificially limiting right now is harmful.<p>You can reduce most of the arguments to comments on this. In particular, I think the comments about centralized mining concerns are almost totally specious. Bitcoin has long ago left behind small hobbyist miners with tiny data connections. Block size changes would not have helped them keep up -- there are fundamental aggregation economics in mining that have pushed them out. Any small miner that wants to mine now will do exactly the same thing they would do with 1 Gigabyte blocks: get their work from a pool, and spot verify they haven&#x27;t been cheated.<p>Embedded in the world view of most &quot;Large Block&quot; miners if you follow out the logic is the belief that probably transaction fees won&#x27;t pay for the entire security of the network. Ed Felten put out some calculations to this effect while he was at Princeton. They&#x27;re reasonably compelling arguments, or at least worth thinking hard about.  If you give up on the idea that tx fees have to pay for the entire security of the network, I think large blocks become a super obvious choice to enhance the current utility of the network.<p>If you do not want to give up on that idea, then any block size increase decreases the chance that the tx fee scheme will work. Since it is currently not working (the last two blocks as I write this had .09 and .02 BTC in transaction fees respectively), all such changes must be vigorously fought.<p>At any rate, this is why the &quot;small block&quot; folks have a &#x27;purity&#x27; vibe when they argue; I think they feel they are protecting the original scheme, one they bought into and care about.<p>As you might be able to tell, I don&#x27;t think the tx fee scheme is working right now and hence am a &quot;large block&quot; kind of guy. Forcing it to work, (e.g. shrinking block sizes dramatically, and perhaps refusing to mine on blocks with insufficient fees) would dramatically lower the usefulness of Bitcoin to many people. As it is, it&#x27;s super annoying to have to wonder if a transaction will get included in the next block.<p>Finally, there are some possible tx fee solutions orthogonal to block size miners could implement easily. I have thought for a number of years that miners should just have &#x27;express, regular, bulk&#x27; time/fee cutoffs for txs they would include. They should publish these rates. Of course, this could only be done by larger pools, or a consortium of smaller ones. Even 20% would make an impact on the fee schedule.<p>When I think about the economics though, I ask myself &#x27;who would it help?&#x27; Miners are already dealing with very difficult economics at a macro and micro level, especially if they have chip projects. Getting a little more juice out of their mining would be nice, but is absolutely not what the large-scale mining game is about. On the flip side, it adds cognitive load and frustration to people transacting. It doesn&#x27;t make a ton of sense to me.<p>If we&#x27;re in a world where Bitcoin is still struggling to be useful to a billion people daily, then cognitive load and frustration should be ruthlessly excised from the technology until we get to critical mass.",1434002914
