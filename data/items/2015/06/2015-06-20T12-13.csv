9749834,comment,9749479,9749684,0,0,steckerbrett,,,"Often this sort of leakage comes down to timing, you can infer what a person is doing by the amount of time it takes you to do something. In the simplest example (and only slightly related to the linked article), imagine we have an API end point that allows you to log in using a password. A naive implementation of authentication might look like this:<p><pre><code>    if ( password = &quot;hunter2&quot; ): 
        return True
</code></pre>
This in a lot of cases will be vulnerable to a timing attack. If the user submits the password &quot;huntducks&quot; it will take the function momentarily longer to return than if they had submitted &quot;whalehorn&quot;, due to the underlying comparison exiting at the first non-match. With a bit of trial and error they can deduce the password one character at a time by altering their guess to take longer and longer to execute. To avoid this security sensitive code needs to be time constant, which is a lot harder than you&#x27;d imagine.<p>Attacks like the author are performing are a lot more complicated and use tricks like coercing the victim into signing distinctive plaintexts, but the example also works for more complex systems like ECDSA where people can derive the signing key by just knowing how long it took.",1434804535

On the one hand, C++ has its good sides (Qt rocks, or at least it did the last time I used it (around version 4.8)), but every time I approach C++, I seem to succumb to the temptation of making things overly complex.

Part of the process to become fully certified is kind of a chicken/egg scenario - to become ARDMS certified, you need to work under a cardiologist for a year - but most cardiologists don&#x27;t want to hire someone that isn&#x27;t already ARDMS certified. Anyhow - she was pretty frustrated in how hard it was becoming to get a foot in to the industry when she finally heard back from one practice. The interview is conducted in an apartment on the 50th floor of a luxury building in downtown Manhattan - there were a few other people there just doing work on laptops. She gets the job, but she immediately felt something was off - but she wasn&#x27;t sure what.<p>For the most part she would help in the &quot;office&quot; and do billing and coding from some other offices this doctor owned. Sometimes she would be sent out to one of these offices to actually scan people (which is what she actually enjoyed and wanted to be doing). And sometimes the doctor would take the whole team of people working in the &quot;office&quot; out to very fancy dinners where no expense was spared.<p>A few months (I think it was about 6 months - but could be wrong) in to this job, my wife needed a day off for her own doctors appointment, and it turned out to be a good day to take off - the office was raided by a joint task force of the FBI and Secret Service - they took the main guy in to custody, confiscated all the laptops, etc. My wife got a call later that afternoon from one of the other girls telling her what happened. Eventually my wife was asked to come in to talk with the FBI twice - they had pictures of her outside of the building smoking - knew what she had eaten at one of the dinners, etc. She was cleared from any involvement since she really had no clue what was actually happening.<p>In the end, the guy was arrested for Medicare and Medicaid fraud - he had purchased a radiological service from a doctor that was retiring, and assumed that doctors identity. He was charged with billing out $32 million in services that were never performed - $20M to Medicaid, $12M to Medicare. It definitely seems they were on to him for a little while at least - though I can&#x27;t find any more details besides the original press regarding his arrest.<p>Sadly, my wife lost this time and does not feel right putting it on her resume - so she remained in the chicken and egg scenario and eventually she went back to school to broaden her applicable skills so she can actually work in the field - and hopefully, actually get that certification...",1434803159

Rather, they insist on conceiving a vector as a list of numbers or coordinates. I have come to regard this concept of vector as a kind of conceptual virus, because it impedes development of a more general and powerful concept of vector. I call it the coordinate virus!<p>It&#x27;s hard to tell what the author is proposing, but from the surrounding pages it sure sounds like he&#x27;s talking about teaching vectors as geometric objects with various manipulation rules and <i>avoiding</i> coordinate descriptions.<p>This is actually the sort of angle that may be possible for mathematicians (although I doubt it&#x27;s sensible) but is not for physicists.  In math, you&#x27;re studying the logical implications of various axioms, and the abstract ideas are the <i>goal</i>.  It&#x27;s perfectly possible for a mathematician to learn and master an abstraction that was historically inspired by a physical system without personally ever actually connecting the abstraction to the physical system.<p>But for physics, it is absolute essential that you are also able to think about vectors in terms of coordinates if you are to connect them to the real physical world, which has rulers and T-squares and so on.  Physicists are trying to understand the world, not the abstraction.  In my teaching experience as a graduate student, students adopt the geometric picture of a vector as soon as they are able to, because it&#x27;s vastly easier and more pleasant to work with.  (That&#x27;s why the abstraction was originally developed.)  The students who don&#x27;t fail to do so because they struggle to build the proper abstract machinery in their brains, not because they have been &quot;infected&quot; with the coordinate picture.
