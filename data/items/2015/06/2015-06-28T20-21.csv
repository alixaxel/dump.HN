Whether a type moves or copies doesn&#x27;t change this, it only influences whether v is usable (statically checked) after the assignment: the worst that happens if you don&#x27;t know what type they are is a compile error talking about &quot;use of moved value&quot; (which also points to exactly the place that did the move).<p>The `Copy` trait (types that don&#x27;t move) is just for types where memcpy is a valid & safe way to duplicate values of those types, it&#x27;s not at all like C++&#x27;s custom copy constructors.<p>See also my answer here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/24253573/1256624"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/24253573/1256624</a>",1435525187

If consciousness were a directly related to complexity, then the moon and sun would be awake and singing -- both are stuffed to the gills with highly organized information! Computers that can provide complex answers, or walk and talk as if they were conscious are no more awake than the moon or sun, and to say otherwise is to be a carnival salesman.<p>Kurzweil and his ilk are seeing the human consciousness in the mirror of the machine and it scares them, as it should. But it&#x27;s a mistake to think that the machine will awaken accidentally or casually, as result of simply adding too many circuits, or feeding the wrong code into the wrong compiler. That idea applied to computers is a philosophical misunderstanding of the difference between intelligence and consciousness.<p>A conscious machine is not something that can be made without extraordinary technical ability and intention-ality - it&#x27;s on par with the ability to colonize planets - way beyond us, and not something likely to happen by accident, except of course in the traditional sense of already having the ability to do so :}",1435524966

When parents were once again allowed to homeschool their own children legally, a diverse free market in educational resources re-emerged--one that had flourished in the early days of the country.<p>Now that there is no longer a reason to operate secretly, homeschooling parents can seek out other parents with similar homeschooling objectives and cooperate. Among the first to do this were religious parents, but every year the percentage of homeschoolers who do it for religious reasons declines.<p>More and more parents are doing it for reasons such as wanting to give their bright kids more advanced classes than the schools are willing or able to provide (that&#x27;s my own incentive), or to more effectively deal with a child&#x27;s specific educational needs, or to allow a child to have a &quot;career&quot; (e.g., acting or sports) while still a minor.<p>Even those of us sending our kids to public schools benefit from this market in homeschooling options. We would be able to benefit a lot more if the &quot;progressive&quot; politicians employed by the teachers unions to keep the decision-making power and money they have wrested from the people from ever reverting back to parents weren&#x27;t so numerous and well-funded.<p>Many of us, for example, would love to switch to a partial public / partial private arrangement where our kids could sign up for some of the school classes without being forced to take all or none (while paying full price either way). For example, we might choose PE, sports, and drama (for social), science (for lab facilities), and math (parents might not know it well enough) from school, but choose to do English at home, programming online, art at a local art school, and Chinese from a parents&#x27; collective. (And I would be willing to continue paying full fare for the public school while using only part of its program if the remainder were rebated, not to me, but to low-income families in the form of educational vouchers they could use outside school.)<p>We can do many of those things after school, but the problem is how late &quot;after school&quot; is each day, and how much time after school has to be wasted on useless school homework, because of the requirement that if our kids want any of the benefits the school offers, they are forced to take it all (as part of the political strategy to make opting out of any of the government-controlled system as painful and impractical as possible.) My kids&#x27; desire for the social experience of school and my desire that they get excellent educations result in a very long day for them, and I would cut out more than half of their school classes (and even more of the homework) if I were free to do so and give it to my kids as play time.<p>Full socialization from partial school, higher-quality education from the free market, plus more play time?

Most countries in the world have actually joined forces in an international collaboration to allocate freight costs between themselves a partnership, where the importing countries eventually ended up holding the bag.<p>This agreement is called Universal Postal Convention, and it&#x27;s important for many of us in everyday life. It is quite simple to regulate mail traffic between all the countries that have joined, not to mention how much it will cost to ship the item. The intention behind the agreement was good when it was introduced, but over a hundred years later, the social conditions changed and it helps to create distortion of competition across the world.<p>Universal Postal Convention was created in a completely different era than the one we are in now, namely around 1870 - at the time it was snail mail which reigned, e-mail was by no means invented and not even the largest visionary had thought of the idea of ​​sending the mail electronically.<p>If we go back to the time of the Convention&#x27;s birth it was not so easy to send a letter abroad. Each country had to enter into their own individual agreements with every country they wanted to send mail to. If you wanted to send mail to a country who didn&#x27;t have a mail agreement with your own country, you would have a problem.<p>The solution could then be to send the letter via a third country, which had agreements in good standing with both the country you were sending from and the country you would send to.<p>To calculate the postage was no trivial matter either. Here you risked the postage getting split up in multiple parts, so that the first part covered the mail crossing the border. Then the poor postal workers had to sit with price lists from other countries to calculate the rest of the postage, after which they also had to stick on a stamp for the recipient country. Should the letter go through several countries on its journey, one can only imagine how cumbersome the system was.<p>One particularly cumbersome system, without a doubt, and so thought the those who lived at that time too. Thus, the Universal Postal Union, UPU, established in 1874. The main pillar of this association is what we call the Universal Postal Convention.<p>The Universal Postal Union was a set of rules that regulated postage prices, and one of the most important rules was the various national postal service does not distinguish between mail from inland and mail from abroad. As a final pillar was the rule that the postal service in each Member State would gain the postage that was paid to ship the overseas mail.<p>It was the end of letters filled with stamps from many countries. The stamp of the sending country was enough to get all the way to the recipient&#x27;s mailbox.<p>In 1947 UPU became a specialized agency within the UN, and it&#x27;s currently the second oldest organization within the United Nations, surpassed only by the International Telecommunication Union - ITU. To become a member here it is a requirement that the Universal Postal Convention is enacted.
In 1969 a central and important change was enacted, it introduced a so-called terminal fee, to be paid if one country mails more to a country other than what it self got in return.<p>This system makes it fairer for those countries that receive a lot of mail. Here in Norway we get considerably more more mail into the country, than what we send out, so this is an important factor we should return to later in this comment.<p>You can still send letters and mail in an easy way, anywhere in the world. The big carrot is still another. If you buy from overseas you are in fact pretty much guaranteed a relatively nice shipping price. How nice shipping price is depends a little on how things are sent.<p>If you order small electronics directly from China, you can get very cheaply from it. Goods are basically reasonable, and shipping charges are usually a joke. Many times you get free shipping, even if the course is baked into the price. This low shipping cost, you can thank the Universal Postal Convention for, since Norway has committed to deliver the item to you without any additional premium.<p>Overall, Norway recieves way more mail than it send from us. This means that Posten Norway gets more terminal charges than what we have to pay in terminal charges to other countries. The problem is that these fees are underpriced compared to what Posten Norway spends to deliver the mail.
How much Posten Norway lose on these mailings, they refuse to tell:<p>> The details are confidential, but as a net importer of mail Posten Norway gets more from the terminal taxes than we pay for exports to others. Our distribution costs are not taken into account in this calculation. Unmet costs we have on international mail must necessarily be covered from other revenue in postal operations, said press officer at Posten Norway, Hilde Ebeltoft Skaugrud.<p>So far we are assured of low freight rates from abroad, but there may be changes in time. There is no denying that many countries are experiencing that the money isn&#x27;t enough and quickly disappears. In a few years this may change.<p>> The Convention is revised every four years, next in 2016, and in this connection we discussed the changes. Posten Norway are working to achieve better alignment between terminal charges and distribution costs, Ebeltoft Skaugrud tell us.<p>As of today, Posten Norway gets a variety of packages and letters from abroad to be handed out. They get paid for the job, but nowhere near what the job is costing them. The cost will be subsidized by the other mail clients, those who send packages and letters in Norway.<p>When two countries are sending mail to each other the weight of the mail from the country that sent the least mail to the other country is counter-accounted. For all the excess the terminal fee has to be pain, which is related to the general economic situation in each country. The result is that Norway will pay a higher fee for their excess kilogram of mail than countries such as China and the United States does. The Chinese have a right to send parcels abroad for an amount considered fair in China, the problem is that the sum is terribly low in a Norwegian perspective.<p>In a survey made ​​by the German consulting company Wissenschaftliche Institut für Infrastructure und Kommunikationsdienste GmbH in 2011, there were several interesting findings related to terminal charges. There Norway comes out as one the biggest losers due to large net imports and high internal expenses.<p>The consulting company also shows that several other have also advocated for a change. The (American) Department of Justice stated, among other things, in 1990 that the terminal fees that differ from the actual cost of delivery has an ability to disrupt the competition. The European Commission said something similar in 1992, when they stated that the terminal fees should be based on what it costs to deliver the consignments in the recipient country.<p>In fact the Universal Postal Union itself makes a statement on the issue a few years later, in 1997; and makes it clear that terminal charges not based on the real costs within the recipient country will create incentives for trade that is not financially sustainable with the great flow across borders.<p>We should be very cautious about predicting anything, but we can not envisage that the current situation will continue forever. Various foreign online stores of various sizes are nearest subsidized shipping to Norway, and considering the increase in imports is probably only a matter of time before something is done. The first opportunity to make a change is 2016 and we will be surprised if it&#x27;s not going to be a good deal more expensive to receive packets from the rest of the world then.&quot;<p>// Article from HW.no (Norway&#x27;s Ars Technica) translated with Google Translate and with the language fixed manually.

HotSpot&#x27;s GCs are so advanced (let alone HotSpot descendents like Zing) that they give you similar behavior even without isolation, and they include collection of shared data structures, too.<p>> Would Quasar, for instance, pause a tight for loop if execution was running long? Or does it only pause on blocking operations like IO?<p>Quasar does full preemptive scheduling but not time-sliced based preemption. This is not because it can&#x27;t -- as a matter of fact, early versions of Quasar did time-sliced based preemption, but it turned out to provide no benefit whatsoever. In fact, Erlang&#x27;s behavior is a limitation. The reason is that Erlang has only one type of thread -- the process, or the user-mode thread -- and therefore has to handle any type of thread, including those that are computation heavy. Thing is, work-stealing is a great scheduling mechanism for transaction-serving threads (that block very often), but not so good for computational threads. Quasar lets you choose: fibers for transactions stuff, and plain threads for long-running computations, both are abstracted into what we call a &quot;strand&quot;.",1435524149

I find I&#x27;m most productive somewhere between the two extremes - start from the few types that I know must be fixed (by the fact that I&#x27;m interfacing with other code expecting them), then continue sketching in both types and code and let each guide the other.<p><i>&quot;On the other hand, the beauty of Haskell is that the code is much cleaner and modular.&quot;</i><p>When you&#x27;re doing it right, absolutely.<p><i>&quot;Don&#x27;t be fooled, though: Even in Haskell you can write very ugly code.&quot;</i><p>Also very much the case - I&#x27;ve done it!",1435523424

One camp says the medical expense and overhead dealing with regulations and union are too costly to operate manufacturing entirely in the US. There is another camp that says the cost operating oversea (training staff, relocating senior staff oversea, legal and book keeping management) is close to operating in the US.<p>Fact is many companies are now moving away from China, and are signing up new manufacturing sites in other Southern Asian countries such as Thailand and Vietnam for lower operational cost (note a lot of the U.S. companies give contract to oversea manufacturer, so it is these manufactures moving away from their own domestic sites - for example, Foxconn being a largely a Taiwanese company Foxconn manufactures outside of Taiwan).<p>I don&#x27;t know how close operating in the US vs operating half of the business offshore is. This is like hiring consultant oversea for software development. The first burden is operational efficiency; it is painful to manage oversea when you want your &quot;brain power&quot; to be in the US. For example, project manager might have to get up early say 6-7 AM to do a stand up and then follow up at 9/10AM (because your business owner / product owner don&#x27;t get up at 6 to talk about progress). If there are bugs that need to be resolved during US hour, you still have to pay the extra hours. You are wasting time going-back-and-forth because your offshore team will get off work when you want to fit a meeting in the afternoon.<p>While most Chinese workers do not form union (fear of repucation), workers do come out and protest from time to time (see Foxcoon strikes). Local laws also do not often favor US companies, and local laws can be a pain in the ass.<p>The only thing I can think of that will keep some companies manufacturing outside of the U.S. is that these companies simply do not have cash in the US.  Imagine a company like Apple (Apple has like 90% of its cash outside of US) the only way they can spend that money is do stuff outside of US.<p>This is just my uneducated opinion, having little idea how business and economy works. I am all for moving closer to proximity. If you are selling in the U.S. it makes sense to manufacture her. This is why many manufacture sites are now built in Mexico (looking at car makers). Shipping cost have been reduced in the last two decades because now we have bigger ships, but still, there is a schedule that you need to maintain.<p>Another classic example where some part of &quot;making&quot; are likely done domestic (or a place where known for using advanced technology) is the classic X ThinkPad series.

As several posters say, the &quot;paleo&quot; diet in some form is not a recent idea.  Despite paleo&#x27;s apparent merit, the &quot;standard&quot; high-CHO diet continues to predominate.  But why?<p>I can only speculate.  Much has been written about &quot;carbohydrate addiction&quot;, an idea that remains controversial, yet there&#x27;s some evidence for it. We know about the huge amounts of sugars in processed convenience foods, disrupting the body&#x27;s energy-handling mechanisms, shunting calories into fat deposition.<p>Industrialization plays a role, it&#x27;s cheaper to produce and distribute pleasing sugar-rich items vs. fresh farm-grown vegetables.  Healthful food is expensive and less available, especially for economically stressed populations.  For others, the problem is exacerbated by a demanding, tech-driven lifestyle.  Under pressure, taking time to consider what&#x27;s truly beneficial for health is less likely.  Just grab the Starbucks and let&#x27;s go.<p>While obesity is in part a behavioral issue, it&#x27;s a fallacy to assume it&#x27;s <i>only</i> a subset of the &quot;mental health&quot; domain. I assert obesity is the most complex medical condition we face.  All body systems, down to each and every cell has a stake in the intake and distribution of energy, and plays some role in these processes.<p>Metabolic illness is among the most prevalent and costly to our economy, and also among the most intertwined with psychiatric, medical, cultural, and political phenomena. As pointed out, Banting&#x27;s fish diet of 1863 worked, but also roundly criticized.  The insight keeps reemerging, which seems to mean it&#x27;s a pointer to solutions, not itself a solution.",1435522412

After all, registrars were required to send out WDRP notices and potentially schedule a domain for deletion if those emails bounced. Moreover, registrars required valid email addresses so that domain transfers could take place and, also, so that people could be billed.<p>&#x27;Relays&#x27; requires that email forwarding works on the provider&#x27;s side when WHOIS privacy is in place. There are other complicating factors that can cause issues here, such as SPF records for the domain that don&#x27;t mention the forwarding mailserver, but that&#x27;s really it.<p>&#x27;Reveal&#x27; is a consequence of the situation with third-party WHOIS privacy services being normalised. Up until now, you were effectively in breach of your contract with ICANN as a registrant if you used a third-party WHOIS privacy/proxy service because the <i>registrar</i> had invalid contact details for the registrant.<p>&#x27;Reveal&#x27; does <i>not</i> mean that just anybody will be able to ask or demand that the provider disclose the contact details behind a private registration. Most registrars have LEA liaisons who they use to validate that a request from a law-enforcement agency is genuine. If we get a legal demand disclose to disclose details, that goes straight to our solicitors, and we would only reveal them if there&#x27;s a genuine legal reason for doing so. Any other requests are invalid and, at least here in the EU, giving out the contact details of a proxy registration would be against data protection law. So no, the argument that this would be a conduit for doxxing isn&#x27;t a valid one. The exact baseline requirements for the reveal process haven&#x27;t been locked down yet, but they will likely be similar to what I&#x27;ve outlined.<p>You see, both of these processes are already mandatory based on other parts of the registrar-registrant relationship and existing legal requirements. The <i>difference</i> is that it wasn&#x27;t explicitly formalised and non-registrar WHOIS privacy was a massive grey area.<p>If you think this is bad, just be happy that you don&#x27;t live in Germany, Switzerland, or Austria: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressum"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressum</a>",1435521858

Quite apart from the extreme unlikelihood that the member countries would agree on the policy to be pursued in practice by a common monetary authority (and the practical inevitability of some countries getting a worse currency than they have now), it seems highly unlikely, even in the most favourable circumstances, that it would be administered better than the present national currencies. Moreover, in many respects a single international currency is not better but worse than a national currency if it is not better run. It would leave a country with a financially more sophisticated public not even the chance of escaping from the consequences of the crude prejudices governing the decisions of the others. The advantage of an international authority should be mainly to protect a member state from the harmful measures of others, not to force it to join in their follies.&quot;",1435521677

After completing the exchange, the man in the store took a moment to show me the security features of the bills and what I should be looking for to spot counterfeits.
