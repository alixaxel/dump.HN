The adult women could be aunts, guardians, sisters, adoptive mothers, biological mothers, etc.  We can always seek out ways to find words to be unfit in a sentence, but, the purpose of speaking is to communicate.  Normal people will understand that &#x27;moms&#x27; in this case means any adult who in this scenario is representing a child in some capacity.  It&#x27;s shorthand.<p>Sure, the speaker could have included all possibilities when addressing the audience, etc., but why?  We know what they mean, they didn&#x27;t intend to exclude you in any way and as an adult you can process the exceptions (moms, the bathrooms are there) you can figure out where the men&#x27;s toilet is.<p>If we concentrate on people&#x27;s speech patterns, we can always find faults.

9784849,comment,9781983,9781995,0,0,tzs,,,"> A case where it was ruled that loading a program constituted making a copy. Copyright law was later changed to allow that making that copy, being essential to actually using the software, was not a copyright violation.<p>This is a nice illustration of one of the balancing acts involved in making laws. Do you want fewer rules, or do you want simpler definitions?<p>Assuming you are going to have copyright in computer programs in your system, then there are two ways you can reasonably do it.<p>1. You can have a fairly simple definition of what constitutes a copy. That will then include the thing in memory when you load a program from disk to run it, and so you then also need a separate rule to make that not be a copyright violation.<p>2. You can have a more complicated definition of a copy that doesn&#x27;t include a program loaded into memory from a disk. Then you do not need any special rule to allow for that memory image since it is out of scope for copyright law.<p>I think #1 is the better approach. I like my definitions simple so I can keep them all in my head when reading the rules. That way when I&#x27;m trying to understand a particular situation I just need to cram into my head at once the simple definitions and the specific rules relevant to that situation.<p>With the complex definitions/fewer rules approach I think you end up having to hold more in your head, much of it irrelevant to whatever situation you are trying to analyze.<p>I also like keeping definitions simpler and sticking the complexity in the rules because we almost never get things right on the first try--or ever--and so there are almost always going to be revisions. I&#x27;d rather have those in the rules rather than the definitions, so that the definitions can provide a stable vocabulary across many versions of the law.",1435330617

Some people may find it offensive or exclusionary in some cases and it doesn&#x27;t hurt to be respectful of that.<p>We should of course be on the lookout for those who would try to chill free expression via enforcing some sort of Orwellian newspeak by making baseless accusations of being offended/excluded/discriminated against... but those people are rare, pretty easy to spot, and outnumbered by good people who have legitimate complaints.

You run into very complicated issues when you consider how children and property ownership would work in a many-person relationship. Marriage specifies shortcuts for these kinds of things, but they only work for two-person relationships. Polygamous relationships would basically require unique contracts given all circumstances, which is a pretty high burden. It&#x27;s also not clear that polygamous marriages would have the same kind of societal benefits that two-person marriages have.<p>I think it&#x27;s a point that can be convincingly argued, but the legalization of SSM does not imply a requirement for polygamous marriage&#x27;s legalization.

Windows has <i>soooo</i> much more flexibility than OS X and I&#x27;ll be glad to give you a couple of good examples to shore up my argument.<p>For starters - the really big obvious one is that OS X only runs on a very small sub-set of the hardware that Windows runs on. I don&#x27;t care if their business plan dictates it, it&#x27;s dumb and I won&#x27;t use OS X because of it. Windows runs faster on the same hardware anyway.<p>Here&#x27;s a big one for which there are lots of examples - Apple simply does not let you customize OS X nearly as much as you can customize Windows. Apple&#x27;s dumb-it-down attitude reaches all the way to the smallest of features - for instance, <i></i>go try and change the color of your mouse cursor in OS X<i></i>. One day I tried to change it to white because I like that better and I found out that OS X has the cursor bitmap burned into a fucking ROM or something... that&#x27;s just a tad ridiculous, don&#x27;t you think?<p>I think it&#x27;s hilarious that some people are so in love with Apple that they don&#x27;t even see the most basic examples. If the mouse cursor example hasn&#x27;t convinced you please let me know and I&#x27;ll come back with a larger list of just how many ways OS X is limited (and therefore dumbed-down) compared to Windows and Linux desktops.<p>(EDIT: And the same arguments go for the iPhone versus others. Apple doesn&#x27;t let you customize it nearly as much as Android and of course they don&#x27;t let you run it on the hardware you want, so yeah the iPhone is dumbed-down.

Many people will rejoice at this decision, and I begrudge none their celebration. But for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority’s approach is deeply disheartening. Supporters of same-sexmarriage have achieved considerable success persuading their fellow citizens—through the democratic process—toadopt their view. That ends today. Five lawyers have closed the debate and enacted their own vision of marriageas a matter of constitutional law. Stealing this issue from the people will for many cast a cloud over same-sex marriage, making a dramatic social change that much moredifficult to accept.&quot;<p>&quot;But this Court is not a legislature.

Because of the way dependencies are hierarchically scoped, there&#x27;s no version conflicts in Node and a project may end up with 3 different Requests modules with only disk space as the cost.<p>What do you consider to be the downsides to liberally using libraries that reduce the amount of code by wrapping the standard lib or that build on top of other libraries? Personally, and I may be wrong as someone still new to Go, it seems to me that the single monolithic repository model that Google uses permeates the whole community and has made adding an external dependency a Big Deal and something you have to carefully consider instead of something you instinctively do.",1435329250

We don&#x27;t do guaranteed admissions using a score cutoff, except in some cases at the state level where a specific high school achievement level guarantees admission to the state university system... or a certain achievement level in a state&#x27;s community college system guarantees transfer admission into the state university system.<p>The upside is that it puts the power to choose in the hands of the student (for better or worse -- many students & their families have no idea what they&#x27;re doing.  See the post from MichaelCrawford about his application experience.) and mostly eliminates the quota/population problem for schools.  Most universities offer early admission here, which helps them fill a set number of spots with what they see as top students.  One condition of applying early admission at a lot of schools is that you commit to attending their if they let you in.  Of course, schools still offer admission to many more students than they know will attend, and I have no idea whether they do this algorithmically or using tribal knowledge gleaned from previous experiences, but I have very rarely heard stories of a school having serious difficulties because they let in too many kids.  There have been a few, but the worst that happened was they had to put up some excess in off-campus apartments or hotels until attrition shrank the class to the point where campus housing became available again.<p>There are other problems with the US method of college admissions, but I prefer our more holistic process to something as rigid as described in this post.",1435329196

But sometimes it backfires.<p>On 2. - let&#x27;s make it simpler then. The OP&#x27;s (coldtea) premise is that it is not possible to say that one is better than the other (&quot;it makes no sense to say&quot;). The premise is incorrect because in my case, I can make the value judgment that one is better than the other, and further, it is probably safe to assume that most people also have their own ranking. In aggregate, people do make value judgments and do, therefore, make sense of &quot;better&quot;.<p>I agree that it can get a little lengthy discussing subjective value, and not armed with years of philosophy studies, I&#x27;m not very good at it either.<p>On 4. - whilst several world powers such as the US, the USSR, France and Portugal have indeed fought proxy and covert wars to further the interests of a subset of their citizen, there has been no conflict of the scale and geography of World War II since World War II. Vietnam was localized in Vietnam, although it impacted US culture, precisely because Washington was afraid of starting a nuclear war. The only instances of WWII-level losses of lives were due to genocide, often from civil war.<p>As an extreme example of the power of MAD fear, the Yom Kippur War was ended by US intervention (or at least the threat thereof) saving the Israelis at the last minute after Golda Meir made the bet that arming the nuclear weapons would be detected by the CIA and result in exactly such intervention.<p>On 3., scientific knowledge available to the community is a very different thing to personal discovery of such knowledge. You do not need to know electronics, physics or applied mathematics to use a computer, and you do not need to know how to kill someone because there are people who specialize in this and keep the peace. But there is a difference in the type of knowledge that is the discovery and popularization of random forests, and knowing the feeling of taking someone&#x27;s life.<p>Getting better at killing CAN have positive effects. The refined Blitzkrieg with modern equipment waged by the US in the first Gulf War, the product of decades of research on killing and invading, resulted in a very short war with almost no casualties on the offensive side (292 - all figures from Wikipedia), and relatively few on the defending side (20-35,000) and civilians (5,000) compared to what a more even war would have cost (for example, the Iran-Iraq war cost around 100,000 lives for each of these groups). I see this as a net positive.<p>Generally, financing an extreme imbalance of power results in global lasting relative peace, cf Pax Romana, Pax Britannia, Pax Americana.",1435329098

It takes some time to get used to that, but it&#x27;s very far from the hardest tasks developers face.<p>A couple of things that I typically do:<p>- Start with a fully working state, i.e. setup your environment, make sure tests (if there are any) are passing. If you can&#x27;t get things to work properly, that&#x27;s your first issue to investigate and fix.<p>- Don&#x27;t try to understand all of the code at once. You don&#x27;t need it yet. I&#x27;m assuming you want to take over the project for a particular issue. So just focus on that and ignore the rest of the code. If you ask any senior developer about something in their project, there is a great chance they will not remember the exact details, but know where in the code to look at. Aim to get at that level, not memorizing how everything works on the lowest level.<p>- Don&#x27;t make any changes to the code that you don&#x27;t understand. I have a recent example of this. Yesterday I was trying to find a bug in the Phoenix database, which was failing to start after an upgrade. I have never seen the code in my life. After some debugging I realized it&#x27;s doing something with an empty string that shouldn&#x27;t be empty. The obvious &quot;solution&quot; is to add an check if the string is empty and be done. Don&#x27;t do that. Understand exactly why is the problem happening and only do a change like that after you are sure of all the implications. This has two effects, you are not introducing new bugs and you are learning about the codebase. At the end, the fix from my example was just a simple &quot;if&quot;, but without understanding how is it ending up with an empty string, I might have caused more problems than I fixed.<p>- Use the VCS a lot when figuring our why something is done they way it&#x27;s done. Use &quot;blame&quot; to see when things have been changed, read through the logs, etc. This is one of the main reasons why I don&#x27;t like people rebasing/squashing their commits before merging. There is so much information they are throwing away this way.<p>- Adopt the coding style of the existing code. Don&#x27;t try to push your style, either by having inconsistent style in different parts of the code or re-formatting everything. It&#x27;s just not worth it.<p>- Don&#x27;t be afraid to change things that need changing. There is nothing worst than making a copy of some module, call it v2 and then having to maintain two versions. If you are afraid to make a change in the existing code, make yourself familiar with the part of the code first.",1435328376

I have an excellent example in my own company.. A 48yr old American IT worker who makes close to 120-130K per annum... Let me tell you he does a good job but his work merely includes assembling PC&#x27;s for employees, fixing bugs (rebooting Virus scan) and writing minor scripts once in a year to ensure email and server security. Majority of the time he just makes sure that all the employees machines are running smoothly. In terms of education he has an Associate degree in STEM and has been working for the company for 15 years.His position title says Systems Engineer. However a Systems Engineer in Google might actually be working on the Driver less car. Now the reality is that today the work that he has been doing can be taken care of by anyone even without a technical background.. so why pay him 120K? His knowledge was unique and fresh when he joined in 1998 but now in 2015 he is still in the same position , has the same qualifications and doing the same work everyday.. I am not blaming him..for this .. He is getting 120K for a skill set which is obsolete.. why would he think of trying something more or advancing his career..Since our company has a very small IT staff they might not take a step like Disney but otherwise this guy would have been long replaced. If I were him I would look towards more active roles within the company or else If I am so attracted to IT then I would go back to school update myself with the IT of Today and apply to a company that might need my new skills..\nOverall my point is that the technical world is such that today nobody wants to buy an iphone 3GS today. Even if there are some buyers then they definitely do not want to pay $600 to buy it",1435328107

I guess Windows could resort to using the bus/device number information only when there is no other way of distinguishing between two devices (serial number, USB PID/VID...).<p>The impression I get is that when Windows executes the &quot;Found new hardware&quot; thing, it installs (usually from Windows Update, if the setting is enabled) the drivers, but it&#x27;s as if the drivers were installed for that USB port only... it appears to install the driver again and again as I move the device to other ports. This is not the way Linux deals with device drivers (once a driver exists in the kernel or is available as a kernel module, it works irregardless of the port), and as far as I know on OS X and BSD kernels it&#x27;s similar.",1435327235

Here&#x27;s my approach:\n* Skim around to get a general idea of what components are involved.\n* Try to understand that one module/class that keeps getting used a lot or is really important. \n* I mentally trace through that code, as if I&#x27;m a debugger. \n* Most importantly, I write down my discoveries/understanding as I go to help me retain this idea.\n* Re-skim with my new understanding and/or reorganize the code to be more concise or simpler. Depending on how ambitious you are, you might try to keep these changes. But with legacy code, it typically breaks as a result.<p>Every code base takes time to digest all the information. Sure the information passed your eyes, but is it committed to memory?",1435327225
