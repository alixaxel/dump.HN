9782655,comment,9779757,9782517,0,0,Manishearth,,,"Well, policing the other teams is just part of the mod team&#x27;s responsibilities.<p>The design of the mod team can be found in the RfC[1].<p>The driving philosophy is to try and deescalate any situations which may crop up, either in situ or by privately discussing with the involved parties. It&#x27;s easy to forget that the People on The Internet are humans too, so a technical discussion that gets heated sometimes needs a reminder to keep civil.<p>The purpose is to make sure that the code of conduct[2] is upheld online. Rust has had a CoC for a while now, but it wasn&#x27;t enforced. This meant that users violating it in reality were free to continue violating it without much repercussions. And this had happened a couple of times; users were warned after being abrasive but no action was ever taken and it just got worse. The mod team can enforce the CoC by temporarily blocking a user from the project if warnings are ignored. Deescalate whenever possible, and if it doesn&#x27;t work out, warn/act on the warnings.<p>Policing other teams is a part of it; the core team and subteams are also subject to moderation; which is why no core team member is on the mod team. In case of an ugly dispute between a core team member and some other user the mod team is a more impartial way of resolving it. Though in practice I don&#x27;t think the core team would ever be in such a situation.<p>People often say that technical communities should stay technical and not worry about civility or other social issues. In my experience this rarely turns out well, aside from Rust I&#x27;ve seen this idea cause problems in other technical communities. Technical communities are, in the end, communities, and community health is something that needs tending. Maintaining civility and avoiding the exclusion (active or passive) of other users is a part of it, and that&#x27;s something the mod team handles.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1068-rust-governance.md#moderation-team"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1068-rust...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rust-lang.org/conduct.html</a>",1435297138

FWIW, there&#x27;s also an upcoming film &quot;Dau&quot; (in post-production) about the Russian mathematical physicist Lev Landau.<p>One difficulty is that the Wikipedia list does not include made for TV movies and documentaries, like &#x27;Dangerous Knowledge&#x27; (2007) on Georg Cantor, Ludwig Boltzmann, Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing, or the BBC documentary &#x27;Isaac Newton: The Last Magician&#x27; (2013), or the PBS documentary &#x27;Newton&#x27;s Dark Secrets&#x27; (2005), or &quot;Breaking the Code&quot; (1996), another biography of Turing, or &quot;Freedom Man&quot; (1989) about the black American mathematician Benjamin Banneker, or the 1973 Italian TV movie &quot;Non ho tempo&quot; about Galois, or Simon Singh&#x27;s 1996 documentary &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem&quot;, focusing on Andrew Wiles but including other mathematicians.<p>Or the BBC documentary &quot;The Birth Of Calculus&quot; (1986) on Leibniz, the four-part BBC series &quot;The Story of Maths&quot; (2008), the 2008 &quot;Julia Robinson and Hilbert&#x27;s Tenth Problem&quot;, or ... I think you get the picture that there are <i>many</i> TV movies about mathematicians, and most of them are white males. BTW, <i>none</i> of them are &quot;average&quot;.<p>When &quot;Moneyball&quot; was turned into a movie, people asked how a book that dealt with statistics could be turned into a movie, since statistics alone isn&#x27;t that interesting. What big screen movie is there to make out of Dirichlet&#x27;s life? Of Riemann&#x27;s? Of Wiles&#x27;?<p>So, of &quot;regular white guy scientists or mathematicians we&#x27;ve mythologized in the past 20 years&quot;, where I&#x27;ll define &quot;mythologized&quot; to mean &quot;made a movie about them&quot;, and I&#x27;ll limit it to feature length films based on lives of actual scientists:<p>&quot;Kinsey&quot; (2004) on Kinsey, &quot;Copenhagen&quot; (2002, TV) on a meeting between Bohr and Heisenberg, &quot;Creation&quot; (2009) on Darwin, &quot;Something the Lord Made&quot; (2004) about heart surgeons (one of which was a white male), &quot;Tim&#x27;s Vermeer&quot; (2013) though that&#x27;s more an amateur scientist, &quot;The Aviator&quot; (2004) about Howard Hughes (aerospace engineer and inventor), &quot;A Dangerous Method&quot; (2011) concerning Jung, Freud, and Sabina Spielrein (the first two being white males), this fall the film &quot;Experimenter&quot; about Stanley Milgram will be released, &quot;The Insider&quot; (1999) is a drama based on the research scientist Jeffrey Wigand, and &quot;The Strangest Dream&quot; (2008) about the physicist Joseph Rotblat.<p>Those are movies about 10+ real scientists, all male, straight, and not disabled, plus a couple of others. (There were a few movies with other than white, male, straight characters, but certainly not this many.)<p>You for some reason switched to fictional scientists with Gravity (2013) and Interstellar (2014). Why is that? For that matter, you restricted me to scientists and mathematicians, while the protagonists of Gravity are engineers and astronauts - it&#x27;s poor form to change your metric part-way through.<p>If I expand the list to include engineers, astronauts, and similar occupations, then &quot;Captain Phillips&quot; (2013) concerns the captain of the MV Maersk Alabama, which was hijacked by pirates, &quot;The Wind Rises&quot; (2013) about Jiro Horikoshi, the man who designed Japanese fighter planes during World War II ... oops ! Sory, not a white man, though he would have been an &quot;honorary white&quot; in apartheid South Africa, &quot; Zvorykin-Muromets&quot; (2010) about the Russian inventor of television, &quot;Flash of Genius&quot; (2008) about the Robert Kearns and his invention of the intermittent windshield wiper,<p>A problem with your list is it&#x27;s easily interpreted as cherry picking. Jodie Foster was the protagonist of &quot;Contact&quot; (1997), a big budget sci-fi film. How does your choice now of &quot;Gravity&quot; indicate a changed pattern from nearly 20 years ago?<p>Another problem is that you haven&#x27;t established what the baseline should be. Given the 12.2% of the US population is &quot;Non-Hispanic Black or African American&quot;, what percentage of films with &#x27;hero scientists&#x27; should have a &quot;Non-Hispanic Black or African American&quot; in that role? Given that 51% of the adult population in the US are women, how many hero scientist movies should have a women in that role? Perhaps it&#x27;s more that these roles were previously underrepresented?<p>Is the pattern you see simply explained by the secular trend that people other than straight white males are becoming more frequent in science?<p>You ended by picking two items from a different context - postings to HN in the last month and &#x27;male scientists who have been publicly disgraced in the past year&#x27;, I think to establish a pattern. But you again lack the evidence needed to tell if your observations are really a pattern instead of cherry picking. What is the expected baseline?<p>If the ratio of men to women in science is 4:1, then we would expect a female scientist to be publicly disgraced with about the same ratio. (It&#x27;s hard to give a good ratio since I think it&#x27;s more likely that a senior researcher will be found out and reported in the international news. I believe there are more males in higher level positions than females. Also, &quot;Japanese women account for only 10% of the researchers in Japan&quot; and &quot;only 12 percent of the science and engineering workforce in India was female in 2010&quot;, so the international ratio is probably more like 8:1.<p>Checking now, I searched &quot;Retraction Watch&quot; for all people described by the writers as being &quot;disgraced&quot;. The complete list of male scientists in the last few years are: Naoki Mori, James H. Hunton, Dipak Das, Don Poldermans, Yoshitaka Fujii, Joachim Boldt, Diederik Stapel, and Woo-Suk Hwang.<p>The only disgraced female scientist mentioned is Bengu Sezen.<p>This 8:1 ratio is about what I expect from the percentage of women doing science in the world stage, and within the error bars for something with so few numbers.<p>What method did you use to count disgraced male and female scientists? I see you missed Haruko Obokata as another disgraced female scientist, so it doesn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;ve done a systematic search.<p>(A double-check search against sciencemag.org finds Jens Förster and Marc Hauser as additional &#x27;disgraced&#x27; male researchers and no additional female researchers. Note that Science does not use the term &#x27;disgraced&#x27; in articles about Haruko Obokata.)<p>Also, what do you use as the ratio for males in science vs. females in science? If it&#x27;s 4:1 or higher then with 3 male disgraces you would expect less than a 50% chance of hearing about a female in the same situation, no?<p>Otherwise, if you&#x27;re just making connections based on the latest hot gossip, then you&#x27;ll be suffering from some serious bias error. You&#x27;re not going to hear about Naoki Mori on HN.<p>Regarding postings to HN, what is your criteria? For example, &quot;Alain Badiou Is Making a Movie About Plato with Brad Pitt and Sean Connery&quot; from 7 days ago is a movie about a guy. Is it mythologizing a male? What about &quot;Deep Web (2015 Documentary) – The Story of the Silk Road&quot; from a month ago - does it mythologize Ross William Ulbricht? How do you define &#x27;mythologizing&#x27; in such a way that it&#x27;s at least roughly repeatable?<p>If you can&#x27;t do that, then you don&#x27;t really have a good metric.",1435296796

Operation in class A airspace (above 18,000&#x27;) prohibited.  Operation in class B,C,D airspace (near airports, etc.) requires coordination with air traffic control, and probably a transponder.  (There are small UAV-sized transponders, which make drones clearly visible on radar and ID them.)  A UAV license will be required, covering the regulations. The sky has rules of the road, and anyone controlling a UAV needs to know them.<p>There may be a &quot;micro UAV&quot; (< 2Kg) category for toy-sized drones, with fewer restrictions. That&#x27;s still being discussed.  A study on consequences of a drone collision indicate that large aircraft could probably survive collisions with 2Kg drones without serious risk to the aircraft.[2]  That doesn&#x27;t mean no damage, it means the aircraft can land safely.

They needed to put out an MVP to see if it was a product people wanted and if it was an implementation that would stick.<p>Once it started taking off, they realized they needed to add depth to their product. Depth usually means features but not always. So stuff like editing, more photo editing tools, more filters.<p>It&#x27;s hard to appreciate all the depth they&#x27;ve added to the product over the years. Even then, they&#x27;re probably unique in that they had to spend A LOT of their time scaling but if they didn&#x27;t have as many scaling issues then I bet we would have gotten some of this depth much earlier in Instagram&#x27;s life.<p>Remember, Instagram started off as a <i>super simple</i> app with maybe 8 or so filters. Now you have tons of filters, multiple cropping options, panning, colorations, etc etc. It can now almost go toe to toe with most of the dedicated photo editing apps in the App Store. People used to go to another app to do more advanced editing and then come back to Instagram to maybe drop a filter on top and share with their friends. Even some styles of filters weren&#x27;t available on Instagram so people used 3rd party apps just for a particular filter.<p>Today, people do all of this inside the app itself, effectively cutting out those third parties that enjoyed a lot of success during the early days of the app store. Now that Instagram has sufficient depth, users don&#x27;t have to get kicked out to 3rd parties for most of their editing needs, even some of the more advanced actions. This is what I define as &quot;sufficient&quot; depth.<p>Once sufficient depth is achieved, they can buy some time to focus on other things (like the Hyperlapse experiment). How do you know if a product has reached this mystical &quot;sufficient depth&quot;?<p>Well that, my friend, is an art.",1435294872
