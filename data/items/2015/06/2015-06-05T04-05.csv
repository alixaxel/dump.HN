SoA guarantees your services look like services, but won&#x27;t guarantee good multi-service architecture. The difference is that fixing a handful of incorrect functions and fixing a handful of incorrect services is the orders of magnitude in difficulty. So yeah, still start with the call stack.

I have estimated that by the time they got the first 40&#x27; container of product in from Asia that they were double our size; we worked out of a 16&#x27;x16&#x27; garden shed at the time (2).<p>I have battled them for 10 years and they just sold for 12 million. I would be happy with 1 million. But the truth? The truth is that having a competitor HELPED not hurt. The sales conversations went from &quot;why would I buy that?&quot; to &quot;How does it compare to the other guy?&quot; . in short, their aggressive marketing towed me along in their wake. The geeky informed buyers would buy the USA made original (mine), and the mass market would buy his.<p>The main outcome is that I could stop spending marketing on advertising, and focus on innovating and product development. Since my industry is distributor based, and my competitor was #1 in all of them, the best way to compete was to out innovate. Also the easiest, and most fun way. Anytime a new truck comes out I usually have a 3-6 month exclusive window before his overseas operation can deliver product. We pick up a lot of new wholesale customers when that happens.<p>I think that the outcome could have been worse without the &#x27;copy&#x27;. For years we couldn&#x27;t have made the product any faster, we had massive growth in sales. $90K first  year, $500K second, $800K, 1.2M, 2M .. it was hard to buy steel some months we grew so fast. In the end. a competitor is not the end of the world, it is a way for the buyer to make a choice - this guy or that guy. It can be easier to sell if they have someone to compare to; when they have nothing it is a little disorienting for a buyer and they tend to not buy anything.<p>1. product: leveling kit for trucks, so people can put aftermarket wheels and tires on. Another 20 companies copied the product afterward but we don&#x27;t hear much about them.<p>2. We have moved twice. From the 16x16 garden shed, to 6800 sq ft, to the current 15,000 sq ft.
