8941994,comment,8940950,8941858,0,0,ericd,,,"You&#x27;re right, and Prop 13 doesn&#x27;t get nearly enough hate in these discussions. It&#x27;s not just that people are sitting on investments like domain campers, though - it makes it impossible for many people to move, because if they did move to an equivalently valued home, they&#x27;d be paying many times their current property tax. This restricts the liquidity of the housing market and encourages hoarding, which leads to skyrocketing prices among the few houses that do go on the market.<p>If that was slowly phased out, prices would come down as more houses came on the market, and the houses that those people wouldn&#x27;t represent such a huge jump in ongoing property taxes.",1422158361

Why do you think they will even consider linking the huge Boost library with their game ?<p>Boost has libraries that address specific efficiency concerns like the one the article discusses; the standard library containers don&#x27;t. You also don&#x27;t link with the entire Boost library. You link with the components you use, which in the case of a library like intrusive/list is whichever member functions you use from each container instantiation you use. That&#x27;s a static link, too.<p>But no, I don&#x27;t really expect anyone who considers themselves a &quot;hard core&quot; programmer to consider using a library like Boost.<p>>Also, the use of templates is usually a big no - no for most game dev studios.<p>Do you have a specific example?",1422158207

Watch Belichick&#x27;s press conference today, with an understanding of the ideal gas law, and the fact that working in a ball will also increase the temperature of the gas inside it, and it becomes obvious that if they followed the legal procedure Belichick claimed they followed, the Patriots did not cheat, unless you think having your footballs obey the ideal gas law is cheating.",1422157376

We don&#x27;t have to assume boutique products have a quality advantage.  It&#x27;s just that scale is most effective on price, and price sensitivity is not linear. Once products are cheap enough, price discrimination stops being decisive.<p>> The true-differentiation strategy seems to work best when scale, despite its efficiencies, also introduces blind spots in areas such as ... intangibles not entirely consistent with mass production and standardization.<p>That isn&#x27;t really what&#x27;s going on.  Even if the big business is good, and scale is quite useful, there are many, many small competitors.  All of the competitors are making products, and some of them are likely to be exceptional.  So for the big business to stay on top, scale has to be helping a lot.<p>If there are 100 beers on the shelf, and one of them is a mass-produced, and the mass produced one is not #1 in quality, you don&#x27;t have to assume mass-production hurts quality.

Someone asked about it in the comments, but the response didn&#x27;t make sense to me. It seems that the call to IsLinked would introduce a data-race with adjacent deletions, and cause undefined behaviour, unless there is already locking at an outer scope. If there is such locking, the lock inside the destructor is redundant. Have I misunderstood?<p>It has generally been my experience that if control enters a destructor while other threads are concurrently accessing the object, you are in a world of pain. For one thing, this makes it near impossible to safely subclass the object. (Because the subclass destructor will run first, rendering its invariants invalid before the base class has done whatever it needs to do to unlink the object from the outside world.) Anecdotally, I&#x27;ve also found code like this to be deadlock-prone, but I couldn&#x27;t say for sure if the two are causally linked.",1422155819

I use them in HTTP services to simplify returning error JSON objects to the consumer.<p>In general I&#x27;m a bit surprised about all the hate(I say hate because of how people react to it and react to suggestions for how to better work with it) the error system gets.  I find that creative use of error/panic can usually scratch my &quot;this is too much error handling code&quot; itch when it flares up.  As long as it&#x27;s documented in the API I agree that unique public error handling strategies are not all bad.<p>Interestingly I write a lot of C#, which of course has try/catch/finally, and I find that if you are doing it properly you have many levels of handling and a strategy involved at the different levels for what should done when.  I find that many people write TERRIBLE error handling.  There may be try/catch sprinkled around but there will be no strategy to it with edge-cases and improper handling abound(masked exceptions, finaly&#x27;s throwing new, unrelated exceptions, etc).  I personally find the amount of effort required into developing and executing a robust error handling strategy to be about the same between C# and Go.  That&#x27;s not to say that I don&#x27;t sometimes wish Go had C#&#x27;s error handling( ;) ), but I realize they are different beasts with different masters.",1422155013
