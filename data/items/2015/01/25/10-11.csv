8942623,comment,8942208,8942244,0,0,vbezhenar,,,"I wrote a custom keyboard using Swift. XCode stability was mostly OK. SourceKit crashed sometimes (disabling syntax highlight and autocomplete), but it didn&#x27;t cause much headache.<p>The thing that bothered me most was that iOS app wrote with Swift was packaged with 8 MB runtime libraries, so it was like 100 kB of my code and 8 MB of swift runtime libraries which I didn&#x27;t like at all.<p>I tried to learn how to write an OS X application with Swift and for some reason it became a nightmare, SourceKit keeps crashing and it wasn&#x27;t possible to work at all. I guess I triggered some bug. I tried to investigate it, but without much success, I think that XCode will send those crash logs to Apple and may be things are already fixed.<p>Actually I&#x27;m not really sure that Swift is the language I want to use. Objective C is good enough. It&#x27;s good old C which I like. It&#x27;s very dynamic which I like. Cocoa, Cocoa Touch and other frameworks are made for Objective C, not for Swift. I didn&#x27;t made a final decision whether I will invest into Swift, but probably (at least until Apple declares Objective C obsolete) I will just use Objective C. It has its problems, but it has its strength too.",1422183446

I go to church every Sunday, pray and read the scriptures regularly, and plenty of other things besides. The majority of tech people I know in person are also religious, although I am very well aware that this is largely due to selection effects in my choice of friends and places of employment, and not necessarily reflective of general trends in the industry.<p>Furthermore, I find my education in computer science strengthens rather than diminishes my faith. Education <i>in general</i> strengthens my resolve that my religion is largely ascientific (not non-scientific, but rather outside the realm of applicability for scientific investigation); since it can be neither proven nor <i>disproven</i> by empirical evidence, I am free to continue to believe in it if I like, and I prefer to believe. Education in computer science specifically gives me a fairly unique set of tools compared to the average Christian apologist for investigating the internal logical consistency of my beliefs. For example, while I&#x27;m a big fan of C.S. Lewis and his works on the subject, I am also rather fond of the computational approach to the Problem of Pain (aka the Problem of Evil), as overviewed here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiTb6zhqHLI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiTb6zhqHLI</a> .",1422182723

If you do then you can produce a concise definition (i.e. a better program in fewer LOC) and if you don&#x27;t then it can get much more complex. It&#x27;s like the difference between trying to make a machine fly by making wings out of feathers and having it flap, or understanding the principles of aerodynamics and making a fixed wing out of canvas.<p>However, for most non-trivial problems understanding everything up front isn&#x27;t possible. To know what works you may need to create prototypes and iterate, abandoning things which don&#x27;t work or which end in a hairball of complexity and getting opinions from testers.

8942546,comment,8942278,8942278,0,0,exDM69,,,"Nice little article, but the common wisdom in &quot;hobby&quot; OS development is: if you want to write an operating system, do not write a bootloader.<p>The arcane details of initializing a x86 PC are not a good use of brain space or programming time (things like A20 line). The OP says he spent <i>weeks</i> writing this small snippet. There is some appeal in doing it &quot;from the ground up&quot; in Assembly but that&#x27;s very slow and tiresome. And there&#x27;s still the PC BIOS code blob running before your OS loads, so it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re in control of the CPU right from the first instruction it executes.<p>It takes roughly the same amount of trouble as this article (or slightly less) to build a bootable ELF file using the Multiboot protocol, which you can boot to using qemu or bochs directly (e.g. qemu -kernel mykernel.elf) or on real hardware using GRUB.<p>There are lots of advantages to this: the bootloader will initialize the CPU for you and you&#x27;ll enter directly into 32 bit protected mode, the state of the CPU will be in a well defined state. Additionally you can use the bootloader to set up a graphics mode and provide a physical memory address to the VRAM (this would require falling back to 16 bit mode for some BIOS interrupts and then back to 32 bit mode).<p>You&#x27;ll also get a proper ELF binary file with all the section information (useful for setting up your page tables), and debugging symbols so you can debug your kernel in GDB which is a lot more productive than using the built-in monitor facilities of QEMU or Bochs. And you can actually use a linker so you don&#x27;t have to put all your code in one file (you will need a linker script).<p>It also makes sense to boot to C code as soon as possible (Rust is another option, C++ too but it&#x27;s a bit more trouble). I actually did write a small OS prototype in &quot;raw&quot; assembly (with interrupt handling and simple threading), but it wasn&#x27;t very productive and I quickly reverted to writing C code instead and got a lot more done in less time.<p>You shouldn&#x27;t need a lot of assembly code, only the early boot code (a few hundred lines), the interrupt handler entry point and trampoline code for booting the other cores of your CPU. In addition, there will be some inline assembly oneliners for accessing privileged instructions (like lgdt, etc).<p>Here&#x27;s the beginnings of my hobby OS project from years ago. I made the mistake of using 64 bit long mode, which is a lot more work to get booted and not a very good use of time. Stick to 32 bit mode if you want to get things done.<p><a href=""https://github.com/rikusalminen/danjeros"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rikusalminen/danjeros</a>",1422180229
