For an executive making <i>just</i> $10M per year, that&#x27;s $27k worth of time. Add the cost of First Class or private flight, and the total value of a sub-orbital flight will easily be worth $40k for a larger-than-you-think-it-is subset of the population.",1420477119
8839726,comment,8836763,8837976,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"That&#x27;s an impressive achievement. El Sendero Luminoso is rated a 5.12d V climb. For those who don&#x27;t know, back in the mid 20th century when climbing started becoming very popular they invented the &quot;Yosemite Decimal System&quot; for rating climbs, 5.9 was considered the most difficult class possible. However, climbing improved and starting in the &#x27;70s or so people were able to climb routes that were much more difficult than 5.9s, so they just extended the scale. But whereas 5.9 is just one level, 5.10 is actually 4 separate classes (5.10a-d), as is 5.11. That gives you a sense of how difficult (technically beyond impossible from the perspective of a 1960s era climber) a 5.12d class climb is. Additionally, the V grade indicates that it is normally considered a 2 day climb. Honnold&#x27;s climb is simply astounding.",1420477118

But IIRC Google adopted the project as a means to speed up development and execution time for their web services back ends (if that&#x27;s wrong then I&#x27;ll happily welcome a correction).<p>Either way, Go does have a presence in web development - not least of all by Google<p><i>> What&#x27;s really amazing is that it has been drawing the ruby, js and python guys in.

Why not just the fact that you actually have to compile it or that the compiled product has an OS and hardware requirement.</i><p>Only the compiled binary is OS dependant, the code is just as portable as your exampled languages. And the only hardware requirement is the word size and architecture of the CPU - which for web development would nearly always be x86_64. Plus Go makes cross-compiling child&#x27;s play - so there&#x27;s no issues with compiling for another CPU architecture (if, for some reason, you&#x27;re targeting ARM over x86) or for 32bit platforms, Windows, FreeBSD, OS X or Linux.<p>I actually think the fact that Go needs compiling is a real strength of Go. Unit and regression testing of websites can be painful in JIT compiled, dynamic languages; where as <i>go build</i> catches a lot of developer &quot;absent-mindedness&quot; before the web application even reaches the testing phase. Obviously compiling isn&#x27;t going to catch everything, but in my experience, it has massively streamlined the process of developing production ready code.",1420476988

There is clearly an agenda.<p>Any programmer is capable of mastering anything in the field and be just as good as the best of the best. And it is very obvious that many tasks can be done much faster by someone with the specific skills these tasks require. It is also obvious that some people have a CS/CE degree and a broad spectrum of skills that are useful for many tasks and some acquired special skills on how to approach new unfamiliar problems more quickly by having and expecting to deal with a lot of different ones.

It&#x27;s certainly possible to use monads in such languages, but it&#x27;s often hard to justify their use, since there are always less-complex ways to implement particular examples, and without interfaces it&#x27;s hard to relate the examples together.<p>For example, here are a bunch of monad implementations (&quot;return&quot; and &quot;bind&quot;, AKA &quot;>>=&quot;) in Javascript, but it&#x27;s not at all obvious why they are related to each other:<p><pre><code>    function state_return(val) {\n        return [null, val];\n    }\n\n    function state_bind(x, f) {\n        return f(x[0], x[1]);\n    }\n\n    function maybe_return(val) {\n        return [val];\n    }\n\n    function maybe_bind(x, f) {\n        return (x.length > 0)? f(x[0])\n                             : [];\n    }\n\n    function list_return(val) {\n        return [val];\n    }\n\n    function list_bind(x, f) {\n        return [].concat.apply([], x.map(f));\n    }\n\n    function read_return(val) {\n        return function(x) { return val; };\n    }\n\n    function read_bind(x, f) {\n        return function(arg) {\n            f(x(arg))(arg);\n        };\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that in Javascript, the implementation details are there for all to see. I might <i>want</i> to give you a string which depends on some integer state, but you can always see that it&#x27;s actually implemented as an array containing an int and a string. You&#x27;re also free to mess up that array by adding or removing elements from it, which are perfectly valid array operations, but which makes no sense for &quot;stateful values&quot;.<p>Interfaces like monads are useful when we&#x27;re <i>not</i> free to mess around with the implementation; when we must perform all actions through a limited API. When we&#x27;re dealing with such concerns every day (&quot;I&#x27;d like to allow X, but don&#x27;t want anyone to abuse it and end up with Y&quot;) then monads (and functors and applicatives, which they&#x27;re based on) are really useful as standard APIs for allowing arbitrary operations to be performed, under the control of the API.<p>The only example above that even comes close to this idea is the &quot;reader&quot; monad, implemented with `read_return` and `read_bind`. This is because values in the reader monad lets us manipulate the return values of functions, and even in dynamic languages a first-class function is pretty much a black box, so there&#x27;s little we can do to mess it up.",1420476546

I don&#x27;t know that that makes it web focused though.<p>Seems like there is a huge cultural gap or something,  Go was initially built by real-deal C guys.  There is a ton of overlap with them and like the plan-9 and suckless fans.  If you&#x27;re not doing hard-realtime or poking registers, it very very much looks like a language designed to fix the problems C has.  Just about any of the standard UNIX tools could fairly easily be built in Go and probably be cleaner, maybe more bug free.  When the go compiler and run-times are optimized up and the performance is there, it seems like you&#x27;d really need a compelling argument to not write those kinds of tools in Go instead of C.  If you really dive in to the plan-9 and suckless stuff, how many of those programs legitimately have more than a couple data-structures?  They are small, they do one thing, they try to do it well.  There are a lot of &quot;missing&quot; things that they aren&#x27;t urgent the replace because of that, like dynamic linking...<p>What&#x27;s really amazing is that it has been drawing the ruby, js and python guys in.  And generics is a/&quot;The Big&quot; hangup?  Why not just the fact that you actually have to compile it or that the compiled product has an OS and hardware requirement.",1420475146

The craving and mental occupation of hunger is really distracting the first couple of days.  After that you can focus more on your normal tasks without the constant nagging reminder that you are fasting.  In fact, after about 12 days someone offered me a cookie at work and I almost took it and started eating it because it just completely skipped my mind that I had been fasting.  I finally caught myself right before I started to eat it, but the hunger was so far gone from me that I wasn&#x27;t mouth-wateringly rabid about eating a cookie, it was just like &quot;sure, I&#x27;ll take one&quot; without a thought about it.  So, I would probably say pushing through to at least day 3 or 4 would be worthwhile.  If you steal feel handicapped after those days then it probably isn&#x27;t for you.<p>I wish I had done some sort of quantitative test to see if this was beneficial.  I was taking 3 summer classes and working 20-30 hours at a pizza place (yes, hand making pizza all day at Shakespeare&#x27;s Pizza in Columbia, MO while I was fasting.)

We would still have limited lifespan in nature, because of diseases, natural predators, etc. There would be a life expectancy, since people would not live forever. Now suppose a mutation occurs that grants the individual a boost in body functions at a young age with a caveat: a gradual decline in body functions after a certain age. If this certain age is way past the life expectancy of the population, this mutation would give competitive advantage to its bearers, with no real downside, since nobody lives way past the life expectancy anyway.

It&#x27;s true that do-notation must result in a monadic value, but that&#x27;s just because of the type. `return` <i>can</i> be used to construct that monadic value, but there are many other ways to do so:<p><pre><code>    func1 :: Maybe Int\n    func1 = do x <- foo\n               y <- bar\n               return (x + y)  -- Using return\n\n    func2 :: Maybe Int\n    func2 = do x <- foo\n               y <- bar\n               Just (x + y)  -- Building a monadic value explicitly\n\n    func3 :: Maybe Int\n    func3 = do x <- foo\n               y <- bar\n               plusJust x y  -- Using some other function\n\n    plusJust :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int\n    plusJust x y = Just (x + y)\n</code></pre>\nAlso, since `return` is a function, we can use it outside do-notation:<p><pre><code>    wrapAndApply :: a -> (a -> b) -> [b]\n    wrapAndApply x f = fmap f (return x)\n</code></pre>\nWhat makes `return` &quot;special&quot; is that it&#x27;s a method of the `Monad` typeclass. In other words, the name `return` is overloaded to work with any instance of `Monad` (`IO`, `Maybe`, `List`, etc.), depending on the type that&#x27;s required of it.<p>Loads of other functions are overloaded like this, eg. `+` has implementations for `Int`, `Float`, etc. so it&#x27;s not monad-specific.<p>The part which <i>is</i> monad-specific is that Haskell&#x27;s do-notation is hard-coded to the built-in Monad typeclass. We&#x27;re completely free to make our own monad implementation, separate to Haskell&#x27;s built-in one, but we won&#x27;t be able to use do-notation with them unless we implement the built-in `Monad` typeclass <i>as well</i>. That could be as simple as mapping one name to the other:<p><pre><code>    instance MyMonad a => Monad a\n        return = myReturn\n        (>>=)  = myBind</code></pre>",1420473767
