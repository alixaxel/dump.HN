This is evident as they get lost in the details of their rationalizations, but fail to consider the broader assumptions/principles at work in their justifications.<p>For example, point number 4:<p><i>It’s not all great. Football, like most professional sports, is deeply permeated with advertisements, commercialism, and money.</i><p>We see that&#x27;s really just a statement full of bullshit, because it&#x27;s likely pretty easy to find counter-examples of things the intellectual individual thinks are great (Apple products?) which are <i>deeply permeated with ads, commercialism, and money.</i><p>Intelligence is a highly-fluid &quot;thing&quot;, but society tends to view it as book-smart depth in a few micro-niches... i.e. the less something can be understood, the more &quot;intelligent&quot; one appears.

8974720,comment,8972179,8974480,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"> Sports are widely loved and not intrinsically bad.<p>Professional sports are also incredibly problematic in multiple ways. One can argue against those issues--from the corrupting influence of money to the homophobia (now finally breaking down just a little bit) to the willingness to use up players to the normalization of violence (in hockey, in particular). In the same way, one can argue that fast food has virtues that make up for its supposed &quot;intrinsic badness&quot; (which I don&#x27;t see at all: nothing is &quot;intrinsically&quot; good or bad... it depends on how it is used for what for.)<p>> However, even expressing contempt for intrinsically bad activities can be interpreted as offensive and hostile.<p>You say that like it&#x27;s a bad thing. Having strong and forthrightly held tastes and opinions is a virtue and a delight.<p>When I see the vast amount of money and time that is dedicated to professional sports it makes me despair of humanity. Do I want to hang around people who spend a good part of their lives on such activities? I do not. This is not a problem with my social skills.<p>It would be a problem with my social skills if I <i>did</i> hang around with them and bitched about it. But saying, &quot;I&#x27;m glad you&#x27;re having fun, but I think it&#x27;s completely crazy to spend so much time and money on the activity of being a fan&quot; is not.<p>And just to be clear: no one has ever been shy about telling me how far beneath contempt I am for caring more about science, art and poetry than sports. So perhaps problems with social skills exist outside of stereotyped groups that it is currently fashionable to berate regarding them.",1422654867
8974719,comment,8972179,8974255,0,0,soylentcola,,,"The &quot;weird&quot; tone may just be a result of the author writing in a more familiar language.  If the author was already part of an academic subculture, it would make sense that this would show up in the language he is most fluent in.<p>It can come off as incongruous (if only because we&#x27;re not used to an academic making an honest attempt to analyze his observations on sport fans, academics, and a common source of friction between the two cultures).<p>I could easily imagine the other way around - a stereotypical sports guy talking about academic topics in jock lingo - being exaggerated in an SNL skit or something.  The way people &quot;code switch&quot; and just use the language of different subgroups is one of those things we&#x27;re mostly familiar with and accept...even if we can see how it&#x27;s a weird bit of human behavior.  Stuff like that can make for either great offense or great comedy (sometimes both).<p>For my part, I was always drawn to more geeky/intellectual interests as a kid because I was scrawny and weird so the sports guys weren&#x27;t welcoming.  As I got older, being mostly unfamiliar with pro sports made it awkward when coworkers realized I was the only one who had no idea what they were talking about.  I still am not a huge fan of pro sports (if only for the insane amount of hype and greed surrounding them) but I realized a while ago that a lot of my hostility toward &quot;jock stuff&quot; came mostly from insecurity.  Nowadays I do enjoy watching football when my home team is playing.  I own a couple of team T-shirts and maybe catch a baseball game in the summer or watch a few football games at the bar if the home team is playing.  A big part of it was making some friends who were into computers and music and art and reading who also liked pro sports and weren&#x27;t dicks about my lack of knowledge.  As the author says, the social aspect is what makes it enjoyable for a lot of people and when that was bad, my thoughts on sports were negative.  When my social interactions around sports became enjoyable, my general thoughts on sports became more positive.",1422654859

They repurposed the .50BMG ammo, built large long rifles to fire it, and put it to a completely new use from its original intent. In 1980, the Barrett M82 semi-automatic rifle was created - something that the military had no interest in the development of, and which was created solely by the civilian market.<p>The military suddenly took notice of this hard-hitting very long range rifle that used standard military ammo, and suddenly military snipers had a new tool - thanks to civilians - to enhance US national security using this one-man gun which could take out significant targets a mile away.<p>Had there been a ban on civilian ownership of .50BMG guns, which some groups have been pushing for hard for decades, the M82 would never have been developed, and a lot more military targets would have been taken out with far more expensive missiles with far more collateral damage & casualties.",1422654444

Today, almost no consumer electronics interferes with other consumer electronics.   You can use a cell phone inside a data center and receive clear calls.

I &quot;understand&quot; the rules of most sports – except cricket but c&#x27;mon. I can have a good time drinking a pint with friends and listening to them discuss sports. In fact, my ignorance often leads to great conversations, as they explain some backstory about how the wide receivers played on rival college teams or the history of nation&#x27;s soccer team or whatever. It&#x27;s fun. Sports are inherently dramatic, and it&#x27;s easy to be drawn into an evenly matched contest. Given the right context and group of peers who are passionate about the outcome, pretty much everybody will enjoy watching sports.<p>However, I just find the whole process of following a team to be a colossal waste of time. All of the time spent reading about drafts and trades and injuries and stats, they add up to hours every week – even without watching any games.

So an inertial frame in which that particle is at rest cannot extend below the horizon <i>at all</i>. That&#x27;s a violation of law K for a frame falling into a black hole. By violating law K, the latter frame cannot be inertial. Note that law K is about allowing inner frames be extended to fill all of an outer frame.<p>Let a cloud of particles straddle the horizon. Let all the particles above the horizon be escaping to infinity. According to GR, such cloud must be splitting apart. The particles below the horizon must move inexorably inward, toward the singularity at the center of the black hole, whilst the particles above the horizon move ever outward, away from the black hole. Then a frame falling through the horizon of a black hole cannot be inertial, for in an inertial frame the cloud needn&#x27;t be splitting apart (since law K applies). For example, in an inertial frame in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere you can have a cloud of particles in which half the particles are given to be escaping to infinity, and the cloud needn&#x27;t be splitting apart (just let all the particles escape in formation).",1422652661

The truth is though that at that level there is always 100x more stuff going on than you could possibly imagine; how far someone is leaning forward, if their right foot is slightly ahead of their left, where their center of gravity is relative to their normal stance, what moves were tried in previous situations and how will that affect what they try now given what I think I/we am/are showing?

Does pressing Fn go to the Fn layer, or are layers (to use Jef Raskin&#x27;s term) quasimodes, where releasing the Fn button goes back to the Base layer?<p>6. If I switch to the Fn layer, how do I get back to the Base layer?<p>7. What if I want to press two buttons on the Fn layer in a row?<p>8. Can I use it on Linux? Can I customize it there?

Before they went bust, I did see two Fisker Karmas around town. To me, the Tesla is fundamentally a status symbol that happens to be usable.<p>I think Tesla exists in a very odd bubble within Government and Market forces. Taking a $400 Million + loan, then replacing it with investor money, and still angling to get Federal & State tax credits to make it priced &quot;competitvely&quot; to other luxury sedans doesn&#x27;t seem like the technology is really the innovation.

That was because you never knew if a twig or the like might pull the trigger (see the problem with holstering striker fired handguns which catch e.g. a windbreaker cinch tie), and you don&#x27;t trust safeties.  The iffy history of the Remington 700 underlines the importance of Rule 2 (known to fire upon manipulating the safety).",1422651698

It&#x27;s bad to optimize away things that you actually like to do.<p>I think an app like this could optimize away a weak link to arriving a place you want to be. That is, deciding when to initiate a conversation and coming up with an opening. The conversation itself is the valuable thing you want to spend time in. The opening of a comm channel is, in some conceptions, simply protocol.<p>Of course, it does take away the choice of thinking that you want to communicate at that moment, which can start to make it seem like an intrusion into your time and change the way you regard the conversation. I think it depends on the person and their evolving circumstances as to whether the removal of choice in this regard is advantageous.",1422651625
