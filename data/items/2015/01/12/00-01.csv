8872001,comment,8870456,8870456,0,0,stillsut,,,"The challenge isn&#x27;t creating the &quot;Intelligence&quot; but creating a virtual &quot;Environment&quot; that trains the artificial agent to do tasks that learn and alter its environment.<p>With a purely computational environment, all tasks - that can be learned/mastered - can be reduced to basic complexity classes, e.g. prime factorization. To our &quot;natural&quot; intelligence, this seems a contrived skill but consider...better prime factorization would allow the artificial agent to mine all the bitcoins, break passwords, etc making the AI a very rich &quot;in the real world&quot;. And compared to a human calculator, even the worst computer looks like a super-intelligence in this domain.<p>So to learn the skills we consider important, there needs to be a way to make the AI experience and alter a non-virtual world - the physical (macro) world we live in…basically some physical robot that does I/O from the environment to the intelligence. And until the AI has some reason to optimize for behavior in the non-virtual world - have the most kids instead of have the most bitcoins -natural and artificial will remain alien to each other as neither will recognize the others&#x27; reality.<p>With this insight, I&#x27;d diagnose the bottleneck in AI to be in engineering robotics at least as complex as insects, to which we&#x27;re a long way off.",1421024362

8871998,comment,8871179,8871179,0,0,billforsternz,,,"This gave me a nice warm fuzzy feeling as I remembered bringing up bare metal Z80s &#x27;back in the day&#x27; (can it really be 30 years ago? - yes). One trick I used over and over was to start with a blank EPROM. Every byte is 0xff (pretty much the exact opposite of his 0x00 starting point). The nice thing about that was that 0xff is (from memory) a RST 7 instruction. Which again (from memory) is a kind of one byte subroutine call to address 0x0038. This is nice because it means the CPU (should) settle into a kind of infinite loop, endlessly reading 0xff from 0x0038 AND (very importantly) pushing the return address 0x0039 onto the stack. Of course there is no stack at this stage - but that won&#x27;t stop the CPU trying, and the effect is an endless series of two byte writes of 0x39 then 0x00 (little endian!) to an address that decrements forever through the 64K address space. It would typically take of the order of a second to cycle once through 64K, and the A15 line would toggle at this rate, the A14 line twice as fast, etc. You could troubleshoot the entire CPU bus interface this way with nothing more than an oscilloscope. Good times.",1421024285

Sometimes I joked that I was trying to automate myself out of a job, but then I tried to do that.

Sometimes I&#x27;d write scripts and stuff in a language I didn&#x27;t know well to learn more.

Their salary allows them to pay down any student loan debt they might have, build a cash cushion, and sock away $10K/year for retirement.  At 35, when they&#x27;ve built valuable industry experience and connections, they decide to go out and do their own thing.  They stop investing in their retirement account, putting their cash into the startup or raising money, and let the retirement account sit and grow with compound interest.[1]<p>Scenario two: Smart 20-year-old college grad decides against the BigCo route and founds a startup (assuming this is even feasible given any loan debt they might have).  Maybe raises a small funding round, takes a low salary...everything goes back into the business.  There is no investment into a retirement account.

Scenario 2 grad would have just $1,010,730 in their retirement account after investing $10K/year over a period of 30 years.

If you&#x27;re 20, just $1,000 invested into the market once will turn into $21,000 when you&#x27;re 65.  If you keep putting money in regularly, this amount will grow significantly and the sooner you start the more it will grow.  It&#x27;s up to each individual to determine the right path for them, and I&#x27;m not saying it would never make sense to go do a startup when you&#x27;re young (you have more energy, creativity etc), but you must be aware that the tradeoff is losing valuable years early in your financial path that you will never be able to get back.  Arriving at the same spot at 35 that you could have started at at 20 will put you significantly behind others who have used those early years to put the miracle that is compound interest to work for them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calcu...</a>",1421022314

I&#x27;ve heard repeatedly that scheduling is one of the biggest problems that executives have and it&#x27;s one of the main reasons that they get personal assistants. It&#x27;s good to have someone to get coffee or pick up laundry, but scheduling back and forth is a tedious task that takes up a lot of time. I&#x27;ve been thinking about an ai solution to this for awhile now, it&#x27;s good to see one emerge and be used in the wild.<p>The concept of a good ai based personal assistant is one of the Next Big Things. And I mean facebook size big thing. If the busiest and most important people in society start doing all of their scheduling through one software platform it won&#x27;t be long before everyone else follows. And that opens the door to all kinds of other social and communication services. &quot;Have your bot talk to my bot and we&#x27;ll figure out a good time to meet up&quot;. Maintaining a list of your friends and contacts is important, but algorithmically maintaining your relationships and schedule is even moreso. Ton of value here waiting to be unlocked.<p>As with all data based applications, the value increases exponentially with the amount of data being analyzed. The ideal personal assistant is one that will make the same decisions that you would make in the absence of instruction. If you tell a PA &quot;book dinner reservations for my wife and I next thursday&quot;, a good assistant will know what kind of restaurant is appropriate, where you like to sit, whether you prefer dinner at 7:30 or 8:30, etc. You don&#x27;t have to say, because they learn your preferences from the data they&#x27;ve collected from you and previous employers.

I think this essay would&#x27;ve better been named &quot;On ethics in software engineering&quot;.<p>From a purely <i>professional</i> standpoint, we should&#x27;ve long ago settled on a few languages to do our tasks, and focused on exploring how to write and manage decade-long projects in those cases, or at least how to rapidly develop and shift codebases to meet the new year&#x27;s business needs. We&#x27;ve done neither consistently.<p>We should&#x27;ve come up with some kind of licensing and liability system for work done, similar to the Professional Engineering license that is required for building a bridge or skyscraper. This in turn requires that we should&#x27;ve come up with a common nomenclature for solving business problems--we tried this with design patterns, but in a further fit of snowflakeism this approach was unfairly derided and made fun of by our entire industry, mostly because we let it get out of hand.<p>We should&#x27;ve come up with some kind of way of specifying and defining projects, so that we can give an honest quote ahead of time and give clients a way of explaining what they want built and removing the &quot;oh but I guess that&#x27;s not what I wanted&quot; entitlement many seem to have because they (rightly) don&#x27;t respect our professional expertise.<p>We should&#x27;ve long ago bridged the gap between the academic/theoretical practice of computer science and the professional issues of software engineering and the performance issues of computer engineering, but instead we decided that internships and coops (though not always by that name) were the &quot;real way&quot; to learn about software development.<p>We should&#x27;ve done a great many things, but we didn&#x27;t, and now? Now it&#x27;s probably too late to turn things back. So, in the mean time, let&#x27;s make hay while the sun shines, and pass the buck to the next generation of poor hapless bastards.<p>~<p>Oh, and as for the users? I&#x27;ve got a rather unpopular opinion on that:<p>They&#x27;ve accepted, encouraged, and rewarded at every term their own enslavement and disrespect.<p>They&#x27;ve continually decided to ignore how the magic boxes work, decided to embrace the shiny over the functional, and in general cast us as the Morlocks and them as the Eloi.<p>So, we might as well exploit them---they neither notice nor want more.<p>EDIT:<p>And the downvotes, as expected.<p>Until we build software like we build bridges, we shouldn&#x27;t faff about with <i>professionalism</i>. We need to stop coming up with language-of-the-quarters and code spikes and other stuff. And yes, that means that things aren&#x27;t magic and fun and whatever, and that means that things aren&#x27;t interesting, and that means that maybe we don&#x27;t use the exact best tool for the job, but <i>that&#x27;s practical engineering</i>. It&#x27;s boring as hell but dependable and conservative.<p>Until our users realize that &quot;hey, maybe I shouldn&#x27;t spew all of my personal data to complete randos on the internets&quot;, they don&#x27;t deserve to be treated as anything other than a monetizable resource. Until app users are willing to pay more than a buck for their mobile app, we should avoid helping them and instead maximize our revenue. <i>They</i> don&#x27;t respect <i>us</i>.<p>Look, there are edge cases in certain types of bespoke software work, certain good clients and customers that are informed and intelligent, but the most of the sixth of the world that is on, say, Facebook, can neither imagine nor articulate the freedoms they forfeit (for themselves <i>and others!</i>) every day.",1421021919

Seriously, I love reading documentation that has lists of codes meant to concisely summarize specific frequently occurring events. I am the biggest nerd when it comes to pouring through documentation that was designed specifically with the intent to unify a common need that started off fractured.<p>In general though, it&#x27;s just hard to know exactly when and where to implement what standardization. It&#x27;s not just HTTP. The entire world of programming and computer science would be much more elegant with intelligent standardization, but it&#x27;s literally a hard problem. The source of information is the hard problem. It is subject to change.<p>How can you standardize something that is consistently evolving, evolving to the point that it is expected that the functionality of the system is going to exceed all known expectations of it&#x27;s operation and behavior? As developers, we are consistently striving to exceed our own boundaries, to do things better, more optimally, more safely, more legibly, more precisely, more correctly. Our expectations of ourselves is what screws us when we think about &#x27;the big picture&#x27;, because we apply the same model of reasoning to &#x27;the big picture&#x27;.<p>Yes, we do not know what we do not know. However, we additionally do not know how to determine the difference between &#x27;that which exists that we do not know&#x27; and &#x27;that which does not exist that we do not know&#x27;. That is the core problem that lays underneath the lack of implementing standards, and it the reason people standardize things in the first place. Standardization prevents us from re-inventing the wheel. Standardization makes things safe. Standardization makes complex systems predictable even when information about adjacent systems are unknown. Standardization is a vehicle for implementing trust.<p>People get confused because there are too many words for the same thing - too many ways to describe the same things, too many languages to do the same thing, too many explanations meant to teach the same thing. Either we have to learn the hard way (by observing massive failure, or by experiencing it), or we have to hope we are implementing things the most correct way, and trust we will get there.",1421021804

8871866,comment,8870934,8871862,0,0,graycat,,,"Future<p>So, what lessons for the future might a\nyoung person draw from this history?<p>(1) Science.  Off and on, some amazing\nscience, especially physics, played a huge\nrole.  Maybe that will continue.<p>(2) Information.  The desire for\n<i>information</i>, create it, transmit it,\nstore it, use it, etc., seems nearly\nunlimited.<p>(3) Logic.  Want something done?  Well,\ndescribe the work in clear steps.  For a\nlot of work done manually in offices over\nthe past 100 years, such a description is\nnow usually fairly routine.  Then with\nsuch a description, fairly routinely can\nwrite software to do the work.  So, can\nautomate a huge range of old, manual work\nof office workers.  That&#x27;s a lot of what\nfor some decades made IBM successful.<p>(4) Social.  People are highly <i>social</i>\nanimals.  Or to paraphrase E. Fromm, <i>The\nArt of Loving</i>, &quot;For humans, the\nfundamental problem in life is doing\nsomething effective about feeling alone.&quot;\nIn more detail, since humans are also\nthinking animals, we see that alone we are\nat risk, that is, vulnerable to, say, the\nhostile forces of nature (earthquakes,\nblizzards, tornadoes, floods, wild fires,\ndisease) and society (war, crime, economic\ndepression).  Knowing that we are\nvulnerable, we are worried (have\n<i>anxiety</i>) and seek security.  We feel\nmore vulnerable when alone so want to do\nsomething about being alone.  From Fromm\nagain, the first recommended solution is a\ngood romantic relationship.  Next is a\ngood version of religion -- get all\nwrapped up.  Next is membership in a good\ngroup -- get acceptance and approval, a\nfeeling of belonging.  Next, not\nrecommended, is what some college students\ntry -- get drunk on alcohol, high on\ndrugs, and go to an orgy.  So forget about\nthe worries until recover (but have more\nworries).<p>So, to do something about the worries, we\nwant security, financial and emotional,\ndon&#x27;t want to be lonely, do want to be\nloved, want a romantic relationship, want\nto belong, etc.<p>More generally we will want to form good\nfamilies and be in good communities.<p>We will be using computing and the\nInternet for all they are worth for such\nthings.<p>(5) Economic Security.  Likely second only\nto love, and maybe more important than\nlove, and maybe essentially a prerequisite\nto love, people want <i>economic security</i>,\nand for that there is a famous one word\nanswer &quot;more&quot;.<p>The drive to use logic, software,\ncomputing, the Internet, etc. for &quot;more&quot;\nwill remain powerful for decades, maybe\ncenturies.<p>(6) Information.  Now one of the keys to\nmore in economic security, &quot;more&quot;, is\ninformation, and the drive for that will\nalso continue for decades, etc.<p>For <i>information</i>, we take in available\ndata, process it, and report the resulting\n<i>information</i>.  This processing is\nnecessarily mathematically something,\nunderstood or not, powerful or not.  Then\nclearly one approach to more powerful\nprocessing and, thus, more powerful and\nvaluable information, is to use\nmathematics to determine how to do the\nprocessing.<p>E.g., how to look for oil?  Okay, often\noil collects in <i>pockets</i> in the\nsubsurface layers.  So, let&#x27;s map the\nlayers and look for pockets.  How to do\nthat?  On the surface, have something go\n&quot;boom&quot;.  Sound waves go into the ground,\nand they get reflected off the layers so\nthat there is a <i>convolution</i>.  So, to find\nthe layers, take the resulting signal and\ndo a <i>deconvolution</i> -- Enders A.\nRobinson, &#x27;Multichannel Time Series\nAnalysis with Digital Computer Programs&#x27;.\nThe fast way to do deconvolution?  Sure,\nthe fast Fourier transform.<p>Once get the oil out, over here have all\nthat oil, from Texas, the Mideast,\nVenezuela, Canada, etc. -- typically it&#x27;s\nall different.  Over there know what can\nsell  -- methane, propane, gasoline,\nDiesel, heating oil, motor oil, etc.<p>So, how to take the available input and\nsell the output and make the most money?\nThat&#x27;s a math problem, in particular in\noptimization.  Long the first-cut approach\nwas via linear optimization (<i>programming</i>\nin the sense of <i>operational planning</i>).\nAt one time, IBM had fun selling\nmainframes to Houston for just this work.\nBut linear programming is not quite the\nright stuff.  So, want some non-linear\noptimization.  Well, for more details, see\nthe work of Christodoulos A. Floudas in\nchemical engineering at Princeton.\nHouston does know about Professor Floudas.<p>There&#x27;s much more to do.  Right:  Likely\nnot a single VC in the country says that\nthey want to see some especially valuable\nsoftware based on some especially powerful\nmathematics.  Hardly a one.  And they are\nnot comfortable backing something they\nunderstand so poorly.  So, right, a lot of\nconfused and unhappy VCs (they so richly\ndeserve it!) but:  Presto, bingo,\nopportunity.  Besides, the main raw\nmaterial into original mathematics is\npaper, pencils, and coffee, and how\nexpensive are those?<p>Almost inevitably, there will be only a\nfew people going that way with the rest\nheaping ridicule, etc.  Not nearly new:\nThink of the Mother Goose story <i>The\nLittle Red Hen</i>.<p>Secret:  It turns out, no matter how much\nadvanced and/or original mathematics you\nuse, nearly always a lot of the actual\ncomputations will boil down to linear\nalgebra and there, numerical linear\nalgebra.  So, take linear algebra,\nelementary, intermediate, advanced,\napplied, numerical, and related subjects\nsuch as linear programming, non-linear\nprogramming, multi-variate statistics,\nordinary and partial differential\nequations and their numerical solutions.\nFor more, study the leading\ngeneralizations of linear algebra,\n<i>functional analysis</i>, e.g., Hilbert and\nBanach spaces.<p>(7) Niches.  One of the standard ways to\nmake money is to have close to a monopoly,\nand one of the standard ways to do that is\nto have a <i>niche</i> of some kind and where\nthe monopoly is protected by, say, a\ngeographical barrier to entry, an\nespecially good product or service, some\ncrucial, core, defensible technology or\nknow-how, a good customer list, some\nnetwork effect, etc.<p>So, go for it!",1421021350

And likely\nand apparently she got a good marriage.\nGood.<p>History<p>But nearly unbroken history of at least\nthe past 200 years shows that the\n<i>knowledge frontier</i> she reached keeps\nmoving forward.  So, yes, likely Ms.\nLivingston knows more about start-ups,\netc. than her mother did, but, even so, it\nis not clear that she knows enough about\nstart-ups people in their teens and 20s\nneed to know now to do well to get started\non doing well in the rest of their\ncareers.<p>Do well?  Sure:  Have to select the good\nstart-ups and f&#x27;get about the rest.  How\nto do that?  Not easily, e.g., the venture\ncapital world tries but, from some data\nposted by VC Fred Wilson on his blog\nAVC.com (1) about 2/3rds of the start-ups\nhe funded flop (don&#x27;t do well, or some\nsuch) and (2) on average the return on\ninvestment (ROI) of US information\ntechnology start-ups is poor, less good\nthan Ms. Livingston helped obtain in her\nfirst job in Boston that counted the\nminutes she was on her coffee breaks.<p>Sure, Ms. Livingston might have majored in\ncomputer science and joined Microsoft in\n1990.  Alas, we come this way only once,\nand we don&#x27;t get do-overs or re-dos, at\nleast not until we get a time machine.<p>So, what to tell young people now?<p>Since Ms. Livingston is talking about\nstart-ups mostly in <i>information\ntechnology</i>, we should consider such\nthings, and there is less to the\nsignificant history there than often\n<i>meets the eye</i>:<p>(1) In the 1930s, Bell saw clearly that\nvacuum tubes were too big, expensive,\nunreliable, and hot for the future of the\nUS long distance phone network.  So, a\nbetter amplifier was needed.  They had a\n<i>solid state</i> rectifier, so what about a\nsolid state amplifier?  They started a\nproject.  WW II got in the way, but soon\nafter the war, presto, bingo, fireworks in\nthe sky, a giant step for Bell and a much\nlarger step for mankind -- the transistor.<p>Exercise:  Why so important?  At the time\nBell saw the importance for civilization\nand, thus, decided not to patent the\ntransistor.  So, write an essay that might\nhave been written in, say, 1949, on why\nthe transistor should be so important.<p>(2) Soon enough the Cold War caused the US\nDoD to want a <i>lot</i> of digital electronics\nfor <i>aerospace</i>, and thus, erupted from\nStanford, due in part to Dean Terman,\nSilicon Valley to supply electronics to\nthe US DoD and later NASA.<p>(3) Fairly soon Silicon Valley saw how to\nput several transistors on one piece of\nsilicon and make <i>integrated circuits</i>.\nGee, could make little devices!  An\nelectronic calculator to replace all those\nmechanical parts?  Sure:  But, still, need\na lot of transistors, maybe more than for\njust a small, simple, general purpose\ncomputer where the rest of the calculator\nfunctions are just from software?  Yup.\nSo, bingo, simple microprocessors.<p>(4) NSF:  MIT had some ideas for\ninteractive computers with a lot of\nsecurity.  So NSF funded their Project MAC\nwhich did the operating system Multics\nwith an hierarchical file system and\nsecurity features <i>capabilities</i> and\n<i>access control lists</i>.  For\nauthentication, MIT did Kerberos.  Then\nKerberos made use of RSA encryption, also\nfrom MIT. Big things still with us; moving\nright along here.<p>(5) Bell Labs again:  They wanted word\nwhacking.  DEC had a mini-computer, so\nBell borrowed a little from Multics, etc.,\nwrote a simple operating system Unix\nwritten in a simple programming language\nC.  Later Bjarne Stroustrup, also at Bell\nLabs, wrote a pre-processor for C to\nsupport software <i>objects</i> -- the\npre-processor was called C++.<p>Since Bell was a regulated monopoly, they\ncouldn&#x27;t sell Unix so essentially gave it\naway.  A group at Berkeley, as I recall\nfunded by the US DoE, did more with UNIX\nand made their work available as the\nBerkeley Software Distribution (BSD).<p>Unix became Linux, and C++ and software\nobjects are still with us.<p>(6) Lots of people, not just Bell, were\nstruggling with typing.  IBM had their\nSelectric and, eventually, a <i>correcting\nSelectric</i> with a little white ribbon that\nwould remove from the page a character\nstruck in error.  But, why no actual word\nwhacking?  Okay, Apple II, IBM PC,\nWordStar, etc.<p>Biggie.  Really big biggie.<p>(7) We got Microsoft that recapitulated\nthe mainframe history in operating\nsystems, and Intel came along with\nmicroprocessors that recapitulated the\nmainframe history in processors.  Now\n<i>WinTel</i> put on &quot;every desktop&quot; a computer\nfor word whacking, Microsoft Word, and\nbusiness arithmetic, Excel.  Gates on the\nway to being the richest person in the\nworld.  Not too doing too badly, Paul\nAllen, Charlie Simoni, Nathan Myhrvold,\netc.<p>(8) Ah, the US DoD again:  It wanted\nbattlefield communications, where even if\nshoot holes in some of the equipment the\nrest still works and provides\ncommunications.  So, we got TCP/IP, e.g.,\nin BSD, that is, we got internets.  Soon\nlabs were connected, and we got the\nInternet.  Soon NSF funded it and IBM ran\nit.  With HTTP and HTML for a particle\nphysics newsletter by Tim Berners-Lee at\nCERN, we got the Web.  Companies put their\n<i>company brochures</i> on the Internet.<p>(9) For the Internet, we needed more in\ncommunications capacity.  Enter Bell labs\nagain:  They&#x27;d seen that one coming, too,\nand had been working on Ga-Al-As (as in\nthe periodic table from a chemistry book)\nsolid state <i>heterojunction</i> lasers and\nhad the solution.  Bingo:  Send at 40+\nbillion bits per second (Gbps) on one\nwavelength, some dozens of wavelength on\none fiber, some dozens of fibers in one\ncable, maybe several cables along a\npipeline, electric power line, railroad\ntrack, highway, river, ocean shoreline,\nacross an ocean or few, etc.  Now, watch\nmovies!<p>(10) Presto, IBM and others learned more\nabout putting magnetic dots on surfaces,\nand now we have hard disk drives in the 3\n1/2&quot; <i>form factor</i> size with a few\ntrillion bytes each.  And HP is on the way\nwith a trillion bytes, solid state, on a\npostage stamp.<p>So, now we can build server farms at\nGoogle, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft,\nApple, Amazon, etc., and we can have\nstart-ups like SnapChat, PInterest, Box,\netc.",1421021203
