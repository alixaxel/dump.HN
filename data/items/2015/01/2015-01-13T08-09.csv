It causes enforcement to be at the whim of the government. You&#x27;re already a criminal, so whether you go to jail is based on whether they decide to prosecute you. Which is clearly not entirely based on whether you committed a crime.<p>> false convictions are statistically rare<p>How do you even propose to measure that?",1421139590

Error handling is a tricky thing that needs thought to get right and should be expressed clearly in the code. My only complaint is that `if e != nil { return e }` takes 3 lines of code. Could `gofmt` format that into one line with no line breaking, I am already pretty happy. If they could add a keyword like `ereturn` that only returns when the last parameter (must be error) is not nil, just as an alias, I would be totally satisfied.",1421139410

8878735,comment,8873914,8874668,0,0,fat0wl,,,"hah great for Pitchfork... i&#x27;m sure they are making much more than the artists off this deal.<p>regardless, they don&#x27;t cover the bands i like and half the music i like isnt on spotify so i just do it the old-fashioned way using discogs.com, downloads, and some good sites that have &quot;related artist&quot; webs. wouldn&#x27;t you know it, the best site i know for related artist webs isn&#x27;t a major industry service, its a torrent site! & they accomplish it trivially through user-edits...<p>so i guess my point is i think its true that Spotify can be convenient for some people, but it doesnt refute my point that they are not trying to do anyone favors (unless it fits their current branding strategy). Spotify is not some techno-anarchistic&#x27;s grand vision of the music industry. it&#x27;s not helping music fans discover more about their tastes, it is generally colluding with industry to guide listeners toward their profit sectors. I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if there is a complex sequence of kickbacks between labels, Spotify, and the venues themselves, designed to minimize artist royalty/payouts. If you follow the music industry you know the deals for artists are generally pretty bad & I don&#x27;t really believe in the &quot;but I go see them live!&quot; rationale because some artists don&#x27;t tour or aren&#x27;t big arena acts. AFAIK it&#x27;s really hard to recoup tour costs unless you are playing decent-sized venues at every stop.<p>i guess it is just hard for me to get into the feelgood mentality of the music scene when i feel like the technology available could allow us to be much more taste/trend/industry-agnostic but instead seems to just be an extension of industry power (Pitchfork being a major industry player as well...), and I generally feel like the quality of the artistic output is in decline so I don&#x27;t want to buy into most of the over-produced crypto-pop junk they are selling (fans of 60s/70s/even 80s music are accustomed to a much greater wealth of musical diversity). As I mentioned though, I am not into music journalism i just use artist webs. Maybe if there were some tastemaker I really wanted to follow I would see this as more convenient but I just don&#x27;t experience music that way. Or at most I&#x27;d be like &quot;well, convenient for me, sucks for the artist&quot;.<p>I think I mentioned in my previous comment -- it&#x27;s not that I can even prove the pricing model false, I just know it doesn&#x27;t do shit for the artists... 1 sale of a self-published physical album is more profitable for most of them then a year&#x27;s worth of Spotify listens.<p>i bet a solely torrents + physical sales model would actually be MORE profitable than involving Spotify... Spotify to me is really only a mechanism for absolving people from the guilt of theft, and conveniently it funnels money back to yet another corp.",1421139390

8878729,comment,8876929,8876929,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"> <i>Because when the product is free the real product is YOU.</i><p>I disagree with this conclusion. Also, I have a related issue with some of the opinions I hear e.g. on HN that confuse me.<p>Many a person says in defense of ads - &quot;but surely authors have to support themselves, otherwise there&#x27;d be no site/software&quot;, &quot;TANSTAAFL&quot;, etc. But this seems to me to be in disagreement with observable reality.<p>What I see is a strong and direct correlation between amount of ads and crappiness/dishonesty. For websites, it is usually &quot;the more ads there are, the more likely content is wrong/crap/nonexisting and the author is there to take your money&quot;. For applications, similarly - more ads means crappier downloads, and - if it&#x27;s the author&#x27;s site that&#x27;s full of banners - the program is most likely shit.<p>What I observe is that there are two reliable types of sources/downloads: 1) linked on author&#x27;s site, free and free of ads - they signal that the author actually cares about the content they&#x27;re providing (see &quot;the toilet-paper companies&quot;[0]) and 2) linked on author&#x27;s site, that ask you to pay up front - here it signals that the author is honest.<p>So do the authors really have to &quot;support themselves&quot;? Or is it that the honest ones either do it for free (because they care, and they get money needed to support it elsewhere) or sell in clear terms? And the ad-dependent money makers have no business being on the Internet in the first place?<p>That&#x27;s why I also feel no guilt for browsing with AdBlock on - neither the ads nor the ad-serving pages are a good deal for anyone in any way.<p>As for the Downloads.com, CNET, et al. - I hope that the introduction of Windows Store/package manager will shut them down for good. They&#x27;re evil, they deserve to be down.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8319102"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8319102</a>",1421139177

I disagree with the writer&#x27;s argument, which is based on a misunderstanding of the pop music market, and the role of technology in that market. The fact that most pop songs played on the radio have their volume maximized is not an issue related to their musicality. All compression does is help you hear the song better, which is especially important for radio play. Some of the other tools that are used in pop music, notably Autotune, are specifically used for that market because the audience wants them. The author lauds bands like The White Stripes for using vintage equipment and for &quot;real&quot; performances, but they are not part of the pop music market. You use the tools that fit the market. That said, even if you find the perfect formula for a pop song, including using a particular technology, people will get tired of the formula very quickly.<p>BTW, here are some videos that give insight into how a pop vocal is built and some mastering techniques...<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R0q6QKAPmo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R0q6QKAPmo</a>
