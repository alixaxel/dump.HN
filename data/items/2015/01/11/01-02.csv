That&#x27;s pretty incredible to me, and far more relevant than discussing Swift&#x27;s barriers to adoption.<p>In RMS&#x27;s world, hackers close ranks to make sure the power stays in the hands of the people, not the corporations.  Sure, corporations might develop a bit of proprietary code now and then, but they are outpaced by armies of hackers writing GPLed code and replicating any innovations they develop.  All the best compiler toolchains are GPLed in this world, and corporations are basically forced to participate in the Free Software movement, or suckle at its teat.  It would not be possible in practice to sell software, because any software your computer could run would have to be GPLed!<p>A lot of other stuff happened instead.  Now we have hackers working at corporations writing open-source code and sharing it with other corporations and the world.  Companies don&#x27;t sell software so much as provide various human and computer services.  Corporations aren&#x27;t evil, they can provide funding and organizational structure that is actually pretty valuable.  And so on.",1420941551

8868737,comment,8866307,8866307,0,0,saluki,,,"Usually contracting with a client is pretty straight forward and simple . . . a contract is a good idea . . . but for straight forward projects it can be as simple as an email exchange outlining the scope and quote. 50% upfront is pretty standard and then 50% upon completion then deliver the code/product after the final payment (keep it on your hosting for reiview/final ok.)  That said best practice is to always setup a simple contract, I don&#x27;t always though and if the total is less than $1k I don&#x27;t expect you&#x27;re going to take them to court to uphold their end of the contract especially overseas . . . typically you can keep everyone happy and receive payments using an incremental review/payment. 50% up front, then 50% at the end or maybe two 25% milestones.  If you get some payment up front and keep code on your server till final payment you&#x27;re pretty well covered. If they balk at 50% get 25% upfront . . . or do a quick 25% milestone.<p>The goal is a combination to see they are paying . . . have them view the work . . . see that they are happy and want to move forward. Then you just keep moving milestone to milestone.<p>You might run in to issues on paypal occasionally but not often. If you have a string of emails from the same email address they send payments from you can usually submit that string of emails and paypal will dispute and win the charge back. I understand your concern but paypal is simple and fast.  Just make sure to ask for an email indicating the project was completed successfully and they are happy with the work if you&#x27;re worried about it.<p>Wire transfers are a pain, you could setup a domain name/SSL and use stripe for payments but they could always request a charge back. In the states most clients are happy to just mail a check (make sure they clear before sending the code over/going to far)<p>For the scraping app . . . note in the scope that at some point the website being scraped will change and the scraper will have to be updated. Can you setup a monthly fee to monitor that part of the app. Build in an automated email if the scrape fails and you can fix it as part of your monthly fee (setup via stripe or paypal (gasp!). Or have a maintenance   fee already quoted for making those updates each time. They should understand that the format of a 3rd party site is out of your control/and their control and will require some tweaks occasionally. Try for monthly, recurring revenue is always best.<p>For tax records just track your side business income and expenses.  In the states they are required to send you a 1099 for work totaling over $600 in a year. See getting an EIN number below that you can use on your W-9 they need to generate your 1099. You&#x27;ll most likely file a schedule C or C-ez along with your 1040. It&#x27;s not real elaborate they only ask for totals. Just keep invoices and wire/paypal/stripe records to verify your numbers if needed.<p>If you&#x27;re worried about your address, get a UPS store address. To protect your Social Security Number you can get an EIN number using your name as the sole proprietorship name. This is useful for affil. programs or anything else that generates revenue to minimize exposing your SSN.<p>When you do use a contract I usually note that the client can use the delivered code as they see fit and that I retain the right to use and re-use portions of the code provided on past, current and future projects.  Most code is modular and re-useable and every developer has modules they re-use.<p>Also add to your contract that you aren&#x27;t responsible for lost revenue or potential revenue resulting from delays or downtime. And that you will guarantee the product/code is functional and you will resolve any defects with in the first 90(or 180) days. (if their project is super time sensitive you can provide them with a proposal that is 20x your quote if they want a guaranteed delivery date that they feel will impact them significantly financially if it&#x27;s not met. Occasionally I&#x27;ve ran in to a client that thinks they are losing $20k/week because their project is delayed.<p>Relax most clients are trust worthy and just want a well developed project delivered on time and are happy to pay for that. There are bad apples out there but not many.  If you get a bad feeling about a potential client it&#x27;s usually wise to trust that and pass on the project.<p>Good luck in 2015.",1420941169

In fact, compared to Rust&#x27;s memory model, both Java and Go are memory unsafe (in the Rust sense of safety, not the traditional sense)<p>Namely, Rust&#x27;s notion of memory safety prevents data races in concurrent programs. This is because Rust&#x27;s region typing / lifetime system rejects racy programs as invalid.<p>Go provides something more like a built-in concurrency framework than truly baking this sort of safety into the language. It&#x27;s just as possible to write racy concurrent programs in Go as it in in Java, C++, or C.<p>Go provides idioms that can help you avoid writing racy programs, but they&#x27;re just that: ideas about how to structure your program, not guarantees that will keep you from shooting yourself in the foot.<p>Go provides a data race detector so if you do write racy programs, you can retroactively detect the problem. Unfortunately data races have this nasty tendency to pop up under unusual circumstances like high load or unusual combinations of events.<p>That the author of this post chose concurrency as the thing to harp on about Go&#x27;s superiority shows how little experience that person has with Rust, IMO.

Everyone would have to have a copy of Google&#x27;s index, or at atleast a reasonable chunk of it, or proximity to some mesh node with a reasonable chunk of it.<p>But mobile devices and mobile bandwidth are not really efficient as nodes to have complete copies, or partial copies. They&#x27;re low on memory, and it&#x27;s not really power efficient or network efficient for them to do the work.<p>But what&#x27;s worse is the problem is updating the index. If everyone ran a distributed crawler, there&#x27;d have to be some way to coordinate who crawls what and make sure there is not too much duplication of effort (else we waste network bandwidth and have a tragedy of the commons) You also run into problems of people trying to (and economically incentivized to) poison the index, and so you&#x27;d need an overhead of duplicate just to avoid that.<p>It&#x27;s not impossible to arrange a distributed crawl/map/reduce over millions of clients, the Folding@Home and other crowdsourced computation platforms show it can be done. But they don&#x27;t have to manage replication and updating of petabyte scale databases, the problems they coordinate are easily sliced up and the results to be transmitted back aren&#x27;t large.<p>I think this tends to drive the network back towards super-nodes, as the leaf nodes aren&#x27;t efficient, and the cost associated with doing the work can be pushed onto others (free rider problem). Eventually, the people running the super-nodes tend to become relied upon by everyone, and those become subject to the same kinds of problems we see today -- government attacks, hackers, privacy invasion, etc.<p>It&#x27;s not like SMTP/USENET weren&#x27;t once relatively decentralized networks. But as millions and then billions of people came on line, the cost to run SMTP or USENET nodes was too high in complexity for most people to run their own. Small and medium dialup ISPs arose to handle that need. But since these were commodities, and little differentiation other than price, the prices were quickly driven to the marginal cost, and there isn&#x27;t much money in running an email server for a few hundred people, you need scale. That eventually drove consolidation, and that&#x27;s why today, you either get your email from Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, iCloud, Hotmail, or one of the other larger players.<p>It may very well be that for some types of problems, there is inherent efficiency in centralization. We should look at perhaps how to change the way the services work to favor cost effectiveness of decentralization, so that rather than it being favored for ideological or aesthetic reasons, it is favored by an economic gradient.",1420939101

The GPL is and always has been a license that limits the rights of programmers in order to ensure the rights of users.<p>This is one of those, frankly, pretty rare cases where the users actually feel a limitation of the GPL (mostly because people that use Emacs has a significant overlap with programmers where the line between developer and end user is very blurry).",1420938746
