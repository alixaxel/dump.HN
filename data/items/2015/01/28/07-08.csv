Also in use are the finite element method (FEM) or the method of moments (MOM). Wikipedia has a decent-ish rundown <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_electromagnetics"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_electromagnetics</a>.<p>The Art of Electronics will not help you for simulation, it&#x27;s a very good practical manual for analogue electronics design. It&#x27;ll help you understand how a circuit works, but electrical engineers rarely need to solve Maxwell&#x27;s equations when designing a circuit. It&#x27;s not a bad idea to read through it however, I can&#x27;t see many situations where you&#x27;d immediately dive into EM simulation without understanding how the circuit works first.",1422431976

For example, the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea.<p>> These dictatorships are then named &#x27;state capitalist&#x27; to avoid self reflection on the marxist parts.<p>This is dishonest, because it means Marxism can never fail: If it fails, it&#x27;s &quot;state capitalist&quot; (a nonsense category), and was never Marxist to begin with!

If the newspaper can&#x27;t sell itself as a business, it can&#x27;t buy ink and paper, and it shuts its doors. The business aspect is inescapable unless it&#x27;s owned and run by the government, which is even more dangerous to press freedom. If you deny the business aspect, you can&#x27;t analyze it, and you can&#x27;t see if it biases coverage.<p>> If a news outlet owner can&#x27;t make money off of it, he can always not do it. Doing it badly, untruthfully, link-baity etc, is not something that&#x27;s really OK (e.g. because &quot;they have to make money&quot; -- pimps have to make money too, that&#x27;s no excuse), but something that is an example of a sick Press.<p>Except they <i>do</i> have to make money.

8958639,comment,8957385,8958613,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The big problem is not precision in the abstract, the big problem is that analog is just about impossible to replicate reliably en masse. You could build 1000 digital circuits and they&#x27;d all come out and operate exactly identical or not at all. Your analog circuits are going to come out in a bell curve roughly between un-usable and perfect with component variation and parts count as ingredients. You can mitigate this to some extent by very careful design and pre-assembly component selection but not all the way.<p>The way to deal with that in the analog world is an expensive process called &#x27;trimming&#x27; where you use adjustable components to get you where you want to be. But trimming makes the circuitry sensitive to being bounced around and makes it more sensitive to temperature changes if you use the cheap version and the expensive version (digital circuitry masquerading as trimmable analog components) puts the horse behind the cart if you wanted analog then you&#x27;re no longer getting it (but some kind of quantized version of analog).<p>For some circuits this is all more important than for others.<p>Finally, digital reduces the component count and so increases reliability and decreases cost. Software is hard to make and expensive but once you have it the marginal cost of reproduction is next to zero.<p>Digital, once the bugs are worked out has none of these issues and so lends itself much more to economic mass production.",1422431275

But giving more refined content the same level of promotion as simplistic pop will.<p>In the sixties teenagers were OK to listen to something as evolved as the Beatles, and the industry went along.

Helping them meet the ordinary demands of their lives, large and small - seeing the smile on their face when you help one of their problems go away. Buying someone a coffee, holding the door open; helping them move, with that spreadsheet. With that printer. Asking them how they&#x27;re doing. (Personally I love buying people gifts, particularly of food. If enjoying a good meal isn&#x27;t &#x27;progress&#x27;, I don&#x27;t know what is!)<p>-Discovering and learning! Exploring the known and unknown world through reading, contemplation, and discovery, both on the job and otherwise. (Which is my favorite).<p><i>>The bank can decide to repossess your house...</i><p>I call this sort of thing &quot;winning the shit lottery&quot;. There are a million ways to &quot;win&quot;, and both nature and other people are constantly drawing from a bowl that has your name in it. But: realize that some of these negative outcomes (particularly the worst of them) are only possible <i>because</i> of erstwhile success. E.g. you don&#x27;t get your heart broken unless you&#x27;ve been in love, and you don&#x27;t get your house taken unless you once owned a house. Whenever you build something, you are entering another ticket in the shit lottery!<p>Anger at the shit lottery is very dangerous because it&#x27;s easy to get wrapped up in the anger, the indignity, the feeling of helplessness, the sense of unfairness - and it&#x27;s a strange feeling because it&#x27;s at odds with our everyday life, which is usually pretty good because no single individual wins the shit lottery that often (at the very least because it&#x27;s hard work to enter).<p>Okay, I was debating whether to write about this last thing, but a couple years back at a meditation retreat the overarching <i>pointlessness</i> of our society hit me like a ton of bricks. What is this we are doing, building things only to consume them in the fires of either vapid consumerism or these new strange, horrible, antiseptic, invisible wars? Do we work for the glory of our religion? Or our nation? Or ourselves? It struck me then that the only possible justification for any of this is if one day mankind grows enough in knowledge and power to spread life beyond earth. (And if that&#x27;s just not physically possible, then we would do worse than to intentionally revert our society to Quaker-level technology and just...enjoy life.)<p>Helping people, exploring, fighting injustice, aspiring to discover or create new worlds. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s an enjoyable life, and real progress. Don&#x27;t be distracted by the shit lottery, or other people&#x27;s goals, however short-sighted. Know that you are right, and they are wrong, and maybe one day they&#x27;ll get it.<p>HTH, angersock.",1422428779

The whole access to lots of cash and the positioning of status is a powerful thing. Even though I&#x27;m well aware that it&#x27;s just a trick to get you to spend &quot;oh, a black card sir, please enjoy some cheap perks that cost you more than they&#x27;re worth, because you&#x27;re <i>special</i>&quot;.

I&#x27;m rather embarrassed, but without discipline it&#x27;s easy to get lost. And every time I&#x27;d hit the limit, the limit would go higher. WF started off at $3k, and moved to $20k with zero explicit requests from me. If you&#x27;re living month to month (US health insurance was $1600/mo), a single bump can easily permanently put you on credit. And, WF never approved me for a line if credit or a normal loan, so getting refinanced at a decent rate was more difficult than it should have been. They also wouldn&#x27;t split the card off so I could just pay down part.<p>In the end, it was my fault for being easily wooed and lacking self discipline.
