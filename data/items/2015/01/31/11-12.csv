Not sure how I&#x27;m interpreted otherwise.<p>I&#x27;m purely talking about the concept of linking to SSH from a HTML page. The original concept of &quot;http auth by anonymous SSH&quot; is ridiculous, and I&#x27;m glad you agree with that.<p>So in terms of using a link to open an SSH session in general (lets assume a non-ridiculous use-case, like opening a session on a dynamically created remote environment).<p>I explained a solution that works right now, needs a couple of new DNS records and potentially a one-line change in the user&#x27;s ssh config file, to provide automatic, safe acceptance of the fingerprint.<p>Your argument is that it won&#x27;t work with an IP address, but that they might still have a TLS certificate for the server IP address, which implies that the person/organisation running the server, spent all their money on &quot;ownership&quot; of a public IP via RIPE NCC (apparently 1650 euro/year), and an expensive SSL cert ($350/year) tied to that IP, but that they can&#x27;t afford a $10 domain name to make SSHFP over DNS (w/DNSSEC) work.",1422705573

8976496,comment,8976015,8976466,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think this will actually have the opposite effect that you&#x27;re looking for.  If you dramatically increase the supply of educated workers, the financial returns of getting that education go way down, for each individual worker.  It may be a good thing for society and help us achieve a lot more collectively, but it&#x27;s not a good thing for the worker.  You&#x27;ll end up with all the wealth pooling at the people who own the companies who employ these workers - much like now, but worse.<p>To increase wages of middle-class workers, you need to increase the demand for middle-class jobs relative to the supply of workers available.  There are three main ways of doing that:<p>1) Increase demand.  Create many more companies, which will force them to compete for talent and raise wages or be left without a labor force.  YC and other accelerators have been good for that, and you see what results in San Francisco (although engineer salaries are arguably artificially depressed at the moment because companies form a cartel on wages and nobody has yet defected to try and corner the market).<p>2.) <i>Decrease</i> supply.  Take some workers out of the labor force, either through converting them into employers through entrepreneurship, encouraging families, legislating a shorter work-week, or discouraging education.  Note that this also will reduce output, which is a tough sell in a global world.<p>3.) Join multiple independent workers into one firm.  This is basically what labor unions are about, surrendering your autonomy as a free economic agent so that everyone has better bargaining power.<p>Productivity gains, when spread across a whole class of people, never end up being captured financially by the group they most apply to.  All the surplus is competed away, and the people who most benefit are the <i>complements</i>, those goods that everyone in the group depends upon.  That&#x27;s why increasing rates of college attendance - and they <i>have</i> been increasing, dramatically, at least in the U.S. - have resulted mostly in rising tuition and lowered wages.",1422704855

In the absence of technology, many things (e.g: ability to write this comment) are not possible.

Calling a single chart &quot;statistical facts&quot; is laughable at best. Especially when we&#x27;ve seen two versions of that chart (see zaroth&#x27;s post), with a near identical title (one has &quot;US families&quot;, the other &quot;US households&quot;) and claiming the same source data from the same blog, showing two very different plots. (Looking more carefully, the trends at least seem similar, so perhaps it is just an issue with the definition of &quot;family&quot; vs. &quot;household&quot;?)<p>Further, it&#x27;s pretty clear that simply changing the brackets could result in a very different plot. And that is what we see in the NY Times article, which has the &quot;households&quot; plot but with the income brackets changed slightly and the 2009-2013 data added. In the NYTimes plot it looks like, since 2000, the top bracket has peaked and shrunk, the middle has continued to shrink, and the lower grew. It&#x27;s a short trend compared to the full graph, but is that the direction we&#x27;re heading now? So at best, this is all highly subjective, and a perfect example of when &quot;statistical facts&quot; can be manipulated to serve and agenda, populist or otherwise.<p>In short, nothing was &quot;completely debunked&quot; here, and a great example of why different sides of a debate end up talking past one another instead of acknowledging how complex these things can be. Two groups with different starting positions looked at the same or very similar plots and drew different conclusions. Color me shocked.",1422704006

But it relies on (a) having data available and (b) in the right format. For those of us doing significant volume ingestions it is not trivial to do this. Hadoop is painfully slow and overall data science end to end tooling is slow, fragmented and incomplete. Some of us do need vendors to be bold and coming up with new technologies/approaches.<p>I think you are doing Hadoop wrong, or confusing current technical reality with &quot;Hadoop&quot;. Hadoop is very cheap, and it allows <i></i>all the datas to be in one place<i></i> This is huge for large scale data science, because in the past we had to pull data across networks fiddle, sample and chuck. The business case for single enterprise datawarehouses was difficult to make (because of the cost) and maintaining them when a CIO with vision did make the case was impossible because it took about 10 minutes for some genius to start running a tactical operational system on it, which was followed (in about 10 minutes more) by a howling call of rage from an MD about why his operational system was locked up due to someone doing stupid queries, which was followed by a lock down on queries in the warehouse.<p>If your hadoop cluster is slow then \n1) move to CHD5 and use spark, use Impala, upgrade to 40Gbe throughout and make sure that you have balance in your architecture, for god&#x27;s sake do not be telling people Hadoop is slow if you are using AWS.\n2) brew your own cluster with GPU&#x27;s and the various crazy infrastructures supporting said architecture (good luck) \n3) go talk to an FPGA vendor or a super computer vendor and upgun (but you must be rich)\nExalitics or Yark might work for you.<p>>And the point about IBM is just stupid. Did you ever think that maybe Watson DID help them slow their sales losses ? Weird that a data scientist would make predictions based on inadequate data.<p>Every IBM rep I have met for the last 3 years has told me that Watson will deal with churn and provide better offer management. I have repeatedly tried to get POC&#x27;s and always always failed. Then we saw Watson tools on Bluecloud and all our suspicions of what Watson is and was are confirmed. Cudos to the Watson team, they spotted that Jeopardy questions can be rewritten as search queries, and spotted that search responses can be rewritten as jeopardy answers.<p>BTW. did anyone get far with Deepdive?",1422702853

If you&#x27;re not convinced of this you can write down all the occurrences you remember that you estimated and how long they actually took.<p>The reality is that you&#x27;re almost always out of bounds (5 minutes takes an hour, 30 minutes takes 2 hours,...).<p>So one approach you can take is break down the project at all into tasks you should be able to delegate e.g. &quot;implement create company page from mockup&quot;. Then list them up in a google spreadsheet and sort the list more or less according to stage (alpha,beta,stage) and then estimate the task length using half-days as a unit. e.g. This will take me 3 half-days to complete.\nOnly use fibonacci numbers when estimating to take into account that bigger tasks carry more inherent uncertainty.<p>The idea is that some simple tasks will be over-estimated and that other tasks will be underestimated but it will even out so you&#x27;re estimate is more accurate and you can say that it will give-or-take a few days X working days to complete.<p>Bear in mind that you just estimated the creation of the first version and that it is impossible to know how many revisions will be needed before it is production-ready.<p>In summary, don&#x27;t kill yourself over expectations.. take some time off to recover and then do a full project estimation to better manage their expectations (and your own).

The most effective (and most used) form of bulk storage remains pumped hydro -- it&#x27;s something like 95% of all energy storage.  Round-trip efficiency is high, technology is (relatively) simple, highly proven, capital costs are (relatively) low, capacities are high, response time is rapid.<p>The disadvantage is that there just aren&#x27;t all that many places which are well-suited to pumped-hydro placements.  Areas with lots of water frequently have little geographic variation, and vice versa.  And lakes with daily level swings of several to tens of meters are a bit dodgy for various reasons.<p>The rest of the storage landscape reads as a list of odds and sods and bad options:  batteries (small-scale, expensive, high maintenance, but fast-reacting and proven, some interesting large-scale potential), flywheels (small scale, <i>really</i> expensive, lots of engineering challenges, but <i>very</i> fast reacting), capacitors (minuscule scale relative to grid, though useful for power conditioning, <i>horrendously</i> expensive, blazingly fast response), compressed air (Boyles law), thermal (sizing and other issues, though potentially national-scale capable).<p>Then there&#x27;s power-to-fuels.  It&#x27;s not very efficient -- you lose about 50% of what you put in going to fuel, Carnot&#x27;s law robs you of all but 35-40% on the way back, leaving you with 17.5% - 22.5% round-trip.  If you factor in solar -- 20% efficient panels at 20% capacity factor, 90% inverter efficiency, 55% spacing factor, you&#x27;re down to per-unit-area storage efficiencies which are lucky to rival biomass -- growing plants and burning them.  Main difference being that you don&#x27;t need to water solar panels -- in theory.  In practice, washing the dust off of them helps, though they tend _not_ to get attacked by insects or birds.<p>I&#x27;ve been meaning to tabulate various energy potentials, though Tom &quot;Do the Math&quot; Murphy&#x27;s got a pretty good list of options.
