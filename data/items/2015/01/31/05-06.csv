If you launch a hit app, like Flappy Bird, you might think money is rolling in, you have few expenses, so investors are a waste of time. However, your Flappy Bird game is going to come and go within the year, and you&#x27;ll watch that daily income fade to zero and end up back to square one.<p>So, you want to strike when the iron&#x27;s hot, and take advantage of that brand. You want to get Flappy Bird sequels coming out, you want Flappy Bird stuffed animals for children, Flappy Bird backpacks, etc. You want these things happening when the game is in its peak, and if you try to do everything on your own, you won&#x27;t make that deadline, and Flappy Bird will be quickly forgotten. So, you get investors, bring in millions, hire staff, and start pumping out Flappy Bird everything to keep it in the spotlight and to grow the business. Or you start doing spinoffs, Wiggle Frog, etc. Either way, you need money to get things moving... fast.<p>Secondly, you need to fight off competition. This isn&#x27;t a huge concern with Flappy Bird, but let&#x27;s say you make a simple app that let&#x27;s you post a few photos of yourself, and others vote on your best picture. You launch, it&#x27;s a huge success, and you have practically zero expenses. Now, you&#x27;re going to have a dozen competitors fire up overnight, and some of them will have more talented developers, some of them will have more free time, and some of them will have huge budgets. They want to take your crown, so you need to stay one step ahead of them. This is where investors come in. The money goes into polishing the app further, turning out new features, or related apps.",1422683839

And I run masterrace ember-on-rails instead of plebian angular on node), and I completely agree, sometimes it really is too much. We see the other people in our industry, folks like jashkenas, wycats, our benevolent overlord Linus Torvalds, and the host of other celebrities and we marvel at their productivity; we hear stories of how ninja-hackers build their entire business working 24 hours straight over a hackathon and come out with an amazing business like Cloudflare; we look towards folks like Zuckerberg, Ohanian, Poole, etc. and seethe with envy at how they can build amazing products that not only scale to massive size but also actually do it all part-time while going to school or whatnot.<p>And then we look at ourselves, at our own handiwork, at the small handful of shoddy projects we have under our belt (most of which probably are ignored because of their incompleteness), and feel frustration.<p>&quot;Why am I not as good as they are?&quot;<p>&quot;I should be better than this!&quot;<p>&quot;I need this done by X or else I&#x27;m going to lose this opportunity forever&quot;<p>&quot;Why am I not making money yet?&quot;<p>If this describes you in anyway, then congrats, you&#x27;re a workaholic passionate about your craft. Me too, actually. But unless you enjoy irreparably wrecking your health, and dying of colon cancer at 40, you need to temper that fire in your heart. Here is what I did to help me get out of my own emotional hellhole some time ago:<p>1. I admitted to myself I am not a &quot;code-ninja&quot;, &quot;programming rockstar&quot;, &quot;chief-architect&quot;, or even &quot;senior-level programmer&quot;. Despite the fact there are plenty of people (some younger than me) who can make software happen overnight, I am not one of those people; whatever I do will take time and often I will make mistakes.<p>2. I admitted this to my partner (aka my mom) and accepted her disappointment in me, but asked her to nevertheless bear with me as I slowly get better. I also admitted this to my investor, who didn&#x27;t mind too much because he was well-diversified against my (no doubt) imminent failure.<p>3. I accepted the fact I am not Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, or any other likely-to-be-invested-in-by-union-a16z-yc candidate going at a break-neck pace to change the world. I&#x27;m happy learning about and doing js, web, css, and programming at my own pace and if my works will one day be appreciated by society, then great, but if not, that&#x27;s okay too.<p>Those 3 realizations helped me fix my attitude and improve my lifestyle, hopefully, they can help you too.<p>A disclaimer: Some may read the above as saying &quot;don&#x27;t have ambition, don&#x27;t try to push yourself, don&#x27;t achieve&quot;. I&#x27;m not saying that at all; instead, I&#x27;m saying to temper your ambitions with patience, and if you wish to overcome your weaknesses, then the first step is to accept them. Life is long and not as fast-paced as the media makes it seem, nor is it a competition to see who can succeed earlier / faster, so go at the fastest pace you can while still managing to enjoy your work.",1422683774

If I had to do it all over again, I might not have done liberal arts (actually, I regret not applying to big schools like Stanford, CMU, or MIT), but it turns out you can recover from most mistakes you make as a teenager.

I don&#x27;t thing DO supports that -- and it is probably not worth the hassle if you can live with dns changeover-time==downtime (say, minutes modulus wrongly configured dns caches).<p>With a couple of dedicated ips, you can usually get away with vm2 taking vm1s ip (and vice-versa) -- but again that depends on your session set-up and/or if dropping sessions are ok.

But then someone read an updated Terms of Use and determined that we actually needed to be using the paid version of Google Earth so many people had their copies removed from their PCs. Then around the time I started someone read an updated Terms of Use and it was determined that there was no problem using the regular version of Google Earth. So it became part of the standard build. Then about a year ago someone read another updated Terms of Use and determined that we were out of compliance and so we removed all copies of Google Earth from all computers. And then we purchased licenses for Google Earth Pro for only those users who really relied on it. For a yearly per-user fee. And now apparently we can install it for everyone once again. For free.<p>I wonder if Google realized that a lot of companies and government organizations were confused about licensing or ignorantly non-compliant or just gave up and tried some other program.

It depends on whether the person committing the act believes the bug is suffering, and whether they enjoy it on that basis or some other.<p>And since the question is open as to what the bug&#x27;s experience is, there may also be a tendency for individuals to interpret their behaviours as being evidence of suffering or not depending on how sadistic they are. Non-sadists may tend to interpret the bug&#x27;s behaviour in ways that suggest there isn&#x27;t any experience of suffering. Sadists will do the opposite.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to see what if any interesting issues the question of the bug&#x27;s internal experience could bear on.

He defines and rejects the imaginary &quot;myth of pure evil&quot; and investigates empirically what causes evil and how it works in the real--not the imaginary--world.<p>The causes he identifies are fragile egotism, material gain, utopian idealism, and sadism (the last is the least, accounting for perhaps 5% of evil acts.)

Is it the last word on the subject? Of course not: it is science, and therefore open-ended.

In that case you are perfectly entitled to lead a morally good life, be a private citizen (or a monk), seek some corner of your own. But, in that event, you must not make yourself responsible for the lives of others or expect good fortune; in a material sense you must expect to be ignored or destroyed.<p>> In other words you can opt out of the public world, but in that case he has nothing to say to you, for it is to the public world and to the men in it that he addresses himself.<p>> Once you embark on a plan for the transformation of a society you must carry it through no matter at what cost: to fumble, to retreat, to be overcome by scruples is to betray your chosen cause. To be a physician is to be a professional, ready to burn, to cauterize, to amputate; if that is what the disease requires, then to stop halfway because of personal qualms, or some rule unrelated to your art and its technique, is a sign of muddle and weakness, and will always give you the worst of both worlds. And there are at least two worlds: each of them has much, indeed everything, to be said for it; but they are two and not one. One must learn to choose between them and, having chosen, not look back.<p>> There is more than one world, and more than one set of virtues: confusion between them is disastrous. One of the chief illusions caused by ignoring this is the Platonic-Hebraic-Christian view that virtuous rulers create virtuous men. This, according to Machiavelli, is not true. Generosity is a virtue, but not in princes. A generous prince will ruin the citizens by taxing them too heavily, a mean prince (and Machiavelli does not say that meanness is a good quality in private men) will save the purses of the citizens and so add to public welfare. A kind ruler—and kindness is a virtue—may let intriguers and stronger characters dominate him, and so cause chaos and corruption.",1422681109
