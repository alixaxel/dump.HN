I live on a hill on some acreage outside of town and can see nearly 40 miles off my back patio without a houses or building in view. I can (and sometimes do) shoot guns from my back porch.<p>But, If you want to be near decent restaurants, stores with clothes you might actually wear, and people you can hold a conversation with.... it&#x27;s probably not the best place.<p>Oh, don&#x27;t let me forget the wind and dust-storms. It&#x27;s blazing hot in the summer, but the winters are fairly mild. The economy is not good (except during oil booms)... wages are very severely depressed, there is not a lot of educated people nor people with ambition as they have left for the most part. The general culture reflects this degeneration. Lazy and slow and non-curious is a way of life.<p>So why am I here? (I&#x27;m not from here). Well... you should see the night sky for one. Far away from big cities in the desert.... you feel like you are right there in the universe and the milky way is a river of light. But truly, the desert to the south (Carlsbad to South Texas) or west of here (Arizona) is a lot more amazing as far as plants and scenery. This is is really the very far Southwestern edge of the Great Plains. (Actually... its a girlfriend thing, that&#x27;s the real reason. But the sky is nice.).<p>This site is about 20 minutes outside town. Not too far away are the mountains.. an hour or so from a ski resort (Ruidoso... a pretty little town but not much there). It&#x27;s on the very edge of the foothills as the plains start turning into the Rockies. The drive up the canyon to Ruidoso is quite pretty. The site is right off the highway (power close or right to site) and has BLM ground surrounding it. There are no trees nor large cactus... it&#x27;s arid grassland with cholla and prickly pear cactus and low scrubby mesquite. There are lots of coyotes, hawks, antelope, foxes, porcupine and skunks. And rattlesnakes. I found 7 of them on the property over last summer. The soil is caliche... old ocean bed reef, and hard as a rock. You would have trouble growing anything between the critters and poor soil. A decent well would probably be around 300 feet deep and the water very very hard. I&#x27;m not sure it would be an acceptable place to live for anyone but the most hermit minded.....",1421286952

If done right, it means that the municipalities own the last mile infrastructure and charge a per-customer rate to ISPs that serve residents. But what that does is significantly lower the bar for ISPs to offer service. It can cost millions of dollars to build out that infrastructure in a city/town and that&#x27;s assuming you have right of way to actually lay the fiber. If the city does that itself, then ISPs only need to connect the city&#x27;s infrastructure to the larger internet...something that&#x27;s significantly cheaper.<p>The Comcasts of the world would still be free to offer service to customers.

Back in medieval Europe there was this nasty practice related to mercenaries that went a little like this: An ambitious noble would borrow a bunch of money from an unscrupulous banker at high interest and use the money to fund a mercenary army. The noble would use his new army to conquer a new land. He would then steal everything he can from the inhabitants, and levy maximum taxes. He would then use this money to repay the banker. If he is successful, he may continue to conquer another land.<p>It was this practice that kept ordinary people in abject poverty in middle ages and kept economic growth down for hundreds of years.<p>If this practice is revived, there will be a lot of suffering.<p>This is yet another one of the screw-ups of George Bush.

One of these is QE policy, others are regulation and enforcement mechanisms that impact capital flows in a broad way (but less broadly than interest rates).",1421285999

As the state slowly becomes encumbered by politicians who are controlled by a tiny minority of individuals who control key sectors of the economy, and the influence on policies from the democratic majority is reduced to zero, a &#x27;country&#x27; controlled by warlord factions and private armies may be closer to the &#x27;market&#x27; equilibrium by eliminating the waste of the bureaucratic middleman. No need to use roundabout ways and Kafkaesque policies to dominate the people and compete with other factions, just do it outright. You can read an example here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_Era"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warlord_Era</a> As you can read in the article, private armies are cheaper and just as effective (Possibly due to government overpaying weapons manufacturers controlled by friends or relatives of public bureaucrats). This efficiency may in the future outcompete public armies.<p>2. Eventually conflicts between warlords lead to increased inequality between various private &#x27;states&#x27; and thus consolidation - and from this monopoly of private armies a state emerges. To maintain this monopoly and to maintain stability and create a sense of legitimacy (and thus preventing new competing warlords from arising) it introduces policies like public bureaucrats only indirectly controlled by the individuals who have actual power, who act for the benefit of the public; and depending on the era, an emperor that governs for all, or allow the public to elect some officials, - the economy prospers and generate more taxes for the rulers.<p>3. This morphs into a more or less fair and democratic and equal society that may last for several decades or even centuries, as the economy booms, inequality is introduced. More affluent individuals are able to afford better education and better connections to their children, who are more able to compete for positions of power. The state slowly becomes encumbered by politicians who are controlled by a tiny minority of individuals who control key sectors of the economy.

8890293,comment,8888747,8890255,0,0,cbd1984,,,"> I think the parent is asking/claiming that public options are almost universally less desirable than the product of self-interest in the presence of competition, so their main effect is just to ensure that the private would-be monopolies need to actually provide a good service.<p>Well, actually, I&#x27;m claiming that a Free Market alternative should be <i>able</i> to win even if the Free Market includes the government.<p>Nobody is <i>guaranteed</i> to win, and I don&#x27;t think a public option would <i>necessarily</i> be odious, but if someone&#x27;s so gung-ho about competition, they shouldn&#x27;t be scared of competing with a government.<p>Edit: OK, yes, I was mocking the Free Market Fundamentalists in my post. Fair&#x27;s fair, they mock the government and the moderates, often using japes invented by Ronald Reagan (peace be upon him).",1421283915

8890286,comment,8888747,8890116,0,0,digikata,,,"If all the gas stations in an area are owned by Exxon & priced too high, the customer drives their car elsewhere.  There is a very, very high capital barrier to entering the market, but customers still hold choice.<p>You can probably observe some region-locking effects short of monopoly by relate the cost of gas in come areas with ability to choose alternatives. e.g. Driving in the middle of nowhere, there are few gas stations and the cost of gas is high. Redundant stations aren&#x27;t built in competition to one another along those stretches because the volume of traffic isn&#x27;t high enough along the &#x27;network&#x27; of the road, but within the range of the typical car, some will drive on and others will be forced the stop. So even that isn&#x27;t as airtight a natural monopoly as last-mile internet.",1421283817

She never does; it just gathers dust, and she does all her stuff (mostly social media) on her desktop.<p>Or in my house, I use zero tablets, and my housemates only use their one tablet for casual games and watching youtube. Anything else, from facebooking to creating invoices for contracting, is done on a desktop. Phones are used as a social device, or for googling/wikipediaing away from home.<p>Desktops seem to be dying out in favour of laptops, but desktop OSs aren&#x27;t being replaced with mobile OSs in my experience.",1421283812

8890281,comment,8888747,8889512,0,0,xamuel,,,"Internet in the UK has downsides too (I learned when I moved here).  BT lets all these other ISPs use its infrastructure, but the actual installation is still BT, and they&#x27;ve no incentive to do it in a timely manner.  It can take weeks or months after requesting service before you get connected.<p>In my case it took three weeks after signing up with an ISP, despite living a stone&#x27;s throw from London.  Especially bad for foreigners because in order to sign up, you first need a UK bank account, and to get that you need things like electric bills to prove your address (the apartment lease paperwork isn&#x27;t enough, at least at Barclays).  If you&#x27;re moving here, be prepared for over a month without broadband.",1421283770
