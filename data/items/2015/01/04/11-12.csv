8834165,comment,8833772,8834070,0,0,pgeorgi,,,"My source is that I work on coreboot, where we have to interact with that stuff all the time. It&#x27;s actually somewhat hidden in our haswell driver because so much is now binary-only on Intel platforms.<p>But look at <a href=""http://review.coreboot.org/gitweb?p=coreboot.git;a=blob;f=src/northbridge/intel/haswell/finalize.c;hb=HEAD"" rel=""nofollow"">http://review.coreboot.org/gitweb?p=coreboot.git;a=blob;f=sr...</a> whose comments refer to both &quot;ME&quot; (the management engine) and &quot;PAVP&quot;, which is the &quot;Protected A/V Path&quot; referred to in the article.<p>One sure way to figure it out is to get a full image of your firmware flash, and analyze it. coreboot has a tool called ifdtool which can parse the &quot;intel firmware descriptor&quot;, which is kind of a partitioning scheme for flash - among other things, to make room for the ME firmware.<p>Sometimes board vendors have full images available for download that you could use for analysis, but these days they&#x27;re often smaller, shipping only the changed parts. flashrom (www.flashrom.org) might be able to read out the chip on your running system, but on Intel platforms in particular, this is often restricted and you&#x27;d need to attach some external flash programmer to read it out and be sure.<p>I think it speaks volumes that you have to work around such things on your own hardware in the first place...<p>As far as I know, vPro only requires the larger firmware and the use of on-chipset hardware, in particular NIC and GPU, since the vPro firmware doesn&#x27;t support external devices.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just economics (no need to write drivers for tons of devices, no desire to support other vendors&#x27; hardware) or if the ME is too limited for that - but my guess is the former.<p>One way we (at coreboot) can test ME involvement is to corrupt the ME firmware with an external flasher (while leaving everything else intact) and see the system either not start at all, or reliably shut down after 30 minutes. The exact behaviour depends on some wiring on the board, I guess.",1420372547

8834159,comment,8833617,8834066,0,0,mdisraeli,,,"Polymorphism typically referred to worms and viruses that changed their own code base as they spread. Most infections, however, happen from phishing emails either with attachments or linking to the payload. Changing the files produced so as to no longer be caught by antivirus signatures is trivial, and you can even create a unique variant for each phish.<p>Many legitimate programs will seem to act similarly - opening files and overwriting contents with something else. ID3 tag writers for MP3s, file type converters, batch image processing, etc. This means you can&#x27;t match easily against the types of actions being taken.<p>Let&#x27;s imagine, however, that the antivirus was still able to detect that something odd was happening. If it prompts the user, they will inevitably click &#x27;yes run this file&#x27;, because that&#x27;s what they have always done. If it quarantines the file... well, you just add another few lines to the phishing email saying that the attachment is perfectly safe (&quot;scanned by symantec&quot; apparently...) and to go ahead and bring it back out from quarantine",1420372353

8834125,comment,8831739,8831739,0,0,justinpaulson,,,"Thought I would weigh in as I have a personal interest and history with fasting.<p>I once fasted for 25 days on nothing but water.  I biked to class and work daily during the fast.  After a couple days, hunger cravings disappeared.  After two weeks I began to gain a mental clarity that I had not encountered before.  I would get a head rush when I stood up too quickly after about 15&#x27;r days, but this was remedied by taking a deep breath beforehand.  You begin to see and think of things differently when you find that you have given up an activity like eating that is so fundamental to human existence.  I lost about 30 pounds (196-166) but almost immediately gained 15 back when I started eating again.  I still remember how amazing a strawberry tasted the first time I ate after 25 days.  I found a new appreciation for all types of foods I had never enjoyed before Infasted.  It was a monumental experience in my life.<p>There are some commenters claiming different things about fasting, but the body is a miraculous thing and it can go quite some time without food.  I plan to complete a 40 day fast along the lines of the Pythagoreans, Buddha, Jesus, and the ancient Egyptian Schools.<p>I do not, however, recommend this for everyone.  An average person should have no problems with a prolonged fast, but there are no guarantees that you do not have some dormant medical issue.  I went about my fast rather naively with no medical supervision, and though I had no negative consequences, I can not recommend my actions to others for obvious reasons.  I am merely sharing my personal experience.<p>In a more relevant note to the article, I have found that fasting always makes me recover from an illness more quickly.  If I have a cold or any other trivial illness I always fast and recover fairly quickly, again N=1.

Or to have the DNS resolver point to localhost and MITM the data, so to say - eventually without even sending the actual data on to WU?<p>I&#x27;m looking for a way to measure the weather and integrate it with my home automation system, and the central heating control eventually, and I&#x27;m willing to shell out for a high quality, reliable outdoor measuring device - but I&#x27;m not paying 300 bucks for a &#x27;LAN module&#x27; nor will I rely on connectivity to the internet for correct functioning of the system.<p>Actually I think this is a major flaw in the OP&#x27;s setup - if the weather is bad enough for him to need such a system, then surely it must be so bad that he loses internet connectivity every once in a while, probably at the times he will need the weather measurements the most?",1420370563

I think we&#x27;ve done quite well with self-promotion (as evidenced by the fact that we&#x27;re on just about every &quot;best place to live/work/retire/drink&quot; list in the past five years).<p>I paid just over $200k for 2500 sqft on 3/4 of an acre that&#x27;s within easy walking distance of four transit lines. It was amusing to hear my friends home for the holidays talking about their $2k+ rents for tiny apartments in NYC and similar locales. Yes, they have access to far more entertainment options than I do, but I have yet to get anywhere close to utilizing all of the options we have here in GR, either.<p>I also appreciate our easy access to water - I can remember once in my lifetime when we had any restrictions on water usage due to drought (lawn sprinkling was limited to alternating days, IIRC). Lake Michigan makes for a great reservoir.<p>As one currently seeking a new job, I&#x27;ve also been disappointed with the number of truly top-notch tech employers in the area; there are a few, but less than we should have IMHO, given the potential client base in the area. Part of it is a function of the labor market, I&#x27;d guess—the talent pool here is not as large as it could be. I think that this will continue to improve as GR continues to cement its reputation as a &quot;millenial-friendly&quot; city and the healthcare sector continues to explode.",1420369999

She watches a lot of films, and needs to make a lot of short clips for her lectures, and to take a lot of screenshots for her papers.<p>This task is becoming increasingly difficult as time goes by. The most reliable method (for her skill level) is now to rip DVDs, removing various bits of protection, before playing the film using VLC on Windows and using VLC to take the screenshot. This is a pain, as she now uses a Mac primarily (as most academia seems to be doing so almost exclusively because it makes presentations easier - connecting to projectors turns out to be the killer feature).<p>For a lot of films though, she pauses a film and uses a camera directed at the TV. Or worse, she&#x27;ll record the clip on a camera (using the camera&#x27;s microphone).<p>Aside from things like Box of Broadcasts (which is for UK broadcast TV), there are few to no resources for academics to resort to for sources of film that will enable dissemination to students through materials and presentations. All clips are short (10-30s), papers feature only a few screenshots when published.<p>Regardless of the studio and technology company desire to lock things down and control distribution, there remains a very legal exception to their controls: education.<p>And of course, education has resorted to alternatives to these locks. There exists private torrent sites that are collections of obscure, international and predominantly non-Hollywood productions. Like torrent sites pre-Netflix, these are actually the most reliable sources of films that academics use for sources. Even when an academic owns a DVD (as nearly all do for future presentation and citation purposes), the torrents deliver files that the academic can use to create clips and screenshots.<p>As much as possible, I try and help my partner avoid such sites. They are good, but in the hard world of academia I&#x27;m not sure her career will survive trying to argue any form of legitimacy of downloading content for academic purposes for already owned DVDs.<p>There is a very real and present danger that copy protections will harm libraries and education.
