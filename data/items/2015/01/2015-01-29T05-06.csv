The server models are there as a way to resolve differences between the state of the models in the view and the state of the models in the server. It&#x27;s nice if, for instance, the users loses internet connection and then comes back online we can intelligently figure out what&#x27;s different between the client and server and sync those changes. Another situation is if we want to intentionally let the client state drift from the server state temporarily. For example, add, remove, and update models in the UI without having them be synced to the server immediately (ex. maybe they can make a bunch of changes and then press &quot;SAVE&quot; to fully persist or &quot;CANCEL&quot; to revert). It&#x27;s particularly useful for apps where there&#x27;s a lot of modification do data rather than just displaying data, but there&#x27;s certainly other valid ways to approach the problem.",1422510551

I kind of defaulted (11 years ago) into ASP classic and ASP.NET as a result of ad hoc consulting/support work for MS technologies back in 2000. But despite my affection for C# I abandoned ASP.NET&#x27;s faux desktop event driven emulation for MVC as soon as it was released. Ever since then I felt sort of stuck in between thinking of myself as a Web Developer vs thinking of myself as a .NET Developer.<p>Which brings my long winded response back to your original question about WPF and data binding. WPF and Xaml are pretty foreign to me (I still have no idea about how WPF/SL/WinRT Xaml differ it all seems like Xaml to me) despite a long history with C#. But I am interested in native app development, so I have been torn on whether to go all in with C# knowing I could take it cross platform with Xamarin but need to reorient myself into the Xaml world or go all in with HTML5 knowing Cordova could be &quot;mostly good enough&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m a Microsoft fan (I actually enjoy my Surface RT and Windows Phone) so WinJS on Windows 8 seemed like a good hedge for not throwing away all my JS knowledge (which is becoming a predominant part of my work with SPAs) but still letting me go fully native. But the overall Windows dev community seems to have spoken, Xaml is it and WinJS is a pariah, MS doesn&#x27;t help much by staying mum on the matter but I think they are trying to shove WinJS into the Cordova camp and double down on Xaml for Win 10 with WinJS eventually fading away.",1422509532

I call information that everything wants access to &#x27;data&#x27;, and I manage that accordingly. Each application interested in it grabs the data, preferably stored in a database selected specifically for the needs of the data and how it&#x27;s accessed, parses it into objects, does the operation it needs to on it, and then perhaps writes a new record of data. The objects can go away as soon as they go out of scope, leaving the data available to construct a new object when it&#x27;s needed.<p>People say to store state in a RDBMS, I think that&#x27;s ridiculous and a perversion of OOP. Program state belongs in memory, not on the network. It&#x27;s not intended to be tabular, an object&#x27;s state often consists of references to other objects. I sure hope you&#x27;re not storing these in a database.<p>An object&#x27;s state is only supposed to be accessible through it&#x27;s interface. It&#x27;s bad OOP to have other parts of the program interrogating its state directly. It&#x27;s bad OOP to have an object interact with more than a few other objects. If you find yourself violating that, then you&#x27;re treating data as state and you need to start managing that data separately, through a persistence layer.<p>Maintainability means being able to alter a program&#x27;s behavior without having to understand the whole thing or make drastic edits. If you follow the rules of OOP and don&#x27;t just say you&#x27;re doing OOP because you&#x27;re using classes and stuff, then you&#x27;ll have earned maintainability because you&#x27;ll be able to change a class&#x27;s internal behavior without affecting the rest of the program because it&#x27;s using an interface rather than needing deep knowledge of the altered class.

They can design awesome algorithms, come up with innovative solutions and take projects into bold new directions. Men are better at technical syntax, middleware, configuration, builds. There is an obvious benefit to having women on technical teams, and yet in most cases they aren&#x27;t there. It isn&#x27;t because they don&#x27;t want to be, or can&#x27;t pull their own weight.

8964446,comment,8963658,8964102,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"Wall Street is much less sexist than Silicon Valley. I&#x27;ve been there. I know. Yes, there are some young men on Wall Street who act boorish, drunkenly hit on women, and generally cause a great deal of discomfort for those around them. They don&#x27;t get promoted. They aren&#x27;t trusted. They&#x27;ll eventually get fired if they keep that shit up. In the Valley, they do get promoted. Misbehavior actually makes a young man more attractive to the VCs, deep in the throes of midlife crisis. That makes the difference. In one place, it&#x27;s discouraged and relatively uncommon. In the other, it&#x27;s rampant.<p>The amount of impropriety that you see in the VC darlings is off-the-charts. I worked (briefly) at an ed-tech where the married executives openly flirted with female subordinates (and one was fired for refusing advances). You&#x27;d never see that shit in finance, these days. That era ended when the people raising VC now were in diapers.<p>I would guess that &quot;the upper echelons of American politics&quot; are also less sexist than Silicon Valley, given that there are women succeeding in US politics, but wouldn&#x27;t know from direct experience.",1422507891

It&#x27;s a fun thing to believe when you make more than anyone else you know who is your age.   It certainly made me feel valued.<p>But the idea that what you get paid has very much to do with the value of what you produce is obviously silly, unless you have a definition of value that makes one person working at a hedge fund worth ten civil engineers.<p>If we&#x27;re going with economic models, what you are paid has everything to do with supply and demand for people with your skill.   The &quot;value&quot; you produce has something to do with demand, but in this case, value is measured in such a way that one hedge fund analyst is worth ten civil engineers, so it doesn&#x27;t really map to how a normal person thinks of &#x27;value&#x27; -  and even then? well, there&#x27;s always the supply side of things to consider.  If other people are able and willing to do your job for less money...<p>>In this industry, &quot;median&quot; is fairly terrible.<p>Compare it, say, to aerospace.   I know guys who have masters degrees from places like MIT working at the local defense contractors. Some of these people are better programmers than I am They can&#x27;t come within 30% of my salary, and I&#x27;m a mediocre sysadmin who barely graduated from one of the worst high schools in California.<p>And yeah, I mentioned civil engineers;  the people who design physical infrastructure.  Roads, bridges, sewer and water systems.  They make even less;  even with advanced degrees and experience, they are lucky to make half what I do.<p>I mean, yeah.  there are other job types that make more money than people who build and support web applications.   But compared to, really, everyone but the top-ends of finance, legal, management and medical, we have it pretty good.<p>People whine about making only $100k/yr and having to pay bay area housing prices.  What do you think it&#x27;s like for the people that clean your bathrooms?  that make your food?<p>We have it pretty good.   I mean, I&#x27;m not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t try to get more, or that it wouldn&#x27;t be great to get paid more, I&#x27;d certainly enjoy a bigger house and a nicer car, and maybe a driver... but sometimes you need to sit back and recognize that even if you aren&#x27;t in the 1%, well, life in the top quintile isn&#x27;t bad at all.",1422507779
