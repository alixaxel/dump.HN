I personally use Google docs as my primary office suite. Lot of software in enterprise is also web-based.<p>Web-based apps are also battling it out on mobile. Lot of apps are just wrappers for accessing web-based content. Performance is the primary obstacle stoping mobile from going completely web-based. Both the new entrants, Tizen and Firefox OS (not to mention Chrome OS) have thrown their weight behind web apps. We consume radio and youtube through web. Its not a stretch to imagine Netflix being accessed primarily through the browser in the future.<p>The growing SaaS business model is highly favoured to web-based apps. It is  taking longer than expected, but the future is generally trending in the direction of web-based apps.",1422079146

Why do I care about 0.67% of throughput? And pretty much all silicon in over a decade does line rate at 1k anyways. Or if its latency a hypothetical higher clocked lane would be something like 1ns instead of ~3ns per frame? Thats the difference between 2 clock cycles and 6 cycles of latency.<p>So what is your shorter/faster ifg buying in practice.",1422079142

I consider it a character-building exercise but I don&#x27;t hold out hope that knowing it will bring me enjoyable work in the future.<p>It seems a lot like PHP in some respects -- there&#x27;s a lot of hacky CF code out there from the dark ages of web development, so maybe folks are just judging the language by that. Or maybe it&#x27;s the Adobe association. They&#x27;ve got kind of an evil-empire vibe that I can&#x27;t quite articulate (and could be imagining).<p>In 20 years, maybe CFML devs will be like those mythological COBOL folks who got lured out of retirement with huge contracts to prop up awful old enterprise systems once the kiddies stopped learning it.",1422078890

It would be good if one can hire lawyers, but to be honest, most developers working on side projects are not (at least in my honest opinion).<p>>It&#x27;s ok if someone isn&#x27;t, but in that case, why bother?
At least there is some sort of protection, and at least to scare away those who cannot afford the risk of being sued. Who knows, a lowly developer now might be able to turn things around and finally afford lawyers at his whim. Or even gain some backers.",1422078411

Obviously predatory pricing by a large firm can drive small firms out of business, but the large firm doesn&#x27;t actually make profit from that until they raise their prices again, which sends a signal to others to start competing. And yes, there are barriers to entry, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like the resources a small firm spends to enter a market would be <i>destroyed</i> when that firm gets driven out of business by the large firm&#x27;s predatory pricing. Assets will get liquidated, sold to someone else, and potentially used to start competing again when the large firm raises its prices.",1422077982

The whole point, in regards to OP&#x27;s question, is that equity is SUPPOSED to motivate a team to get to Facebook levels.<p>If you took 10m of funding and exited for 100m your VCs will NOT be happy, they need you to hit it out of the park to balance out all the losers in their portfolio. Similarly, your engineers who are taking less-than-competitive wages should not be happy, your founders should not be happy. Everybody&#x27;s interests should be aligned, and focused on getting spectacular returns, not simply good ones.<p>We&#x27;re saying the same thing. It&#x27;s either worth a TON of money, in very very rare cases, or it&#x27;s really not worth considering as part of your compensation package. Getting even a 6-figure cashout after taking a 5-figure paycut for 10 years isn&#x27;t necessarily even a break-even for you. You might have LOST money on that deal. As such, the equity is NOT there (and shouldn&#x27;t be interpreted) as a cash-like form of compensation. It is not that. It is motivation for you to get the company to Facebook status. That&#x27;s all it is. So, back to OP&#x27;s question: why give so little? Because if the company gave you more, you would be tempted to build a 100m company, and that&#x27;s just not gonna cut it. Instead, many companies would rather motivate a larger group of people to want it to be a Facebook-level enterprise someday.",1422075858

QM is not a mystery in calculationally, it is a mystery in interpretation.<p>The generalization of probability theory to include &quot;negative&quot; probabilities, really, amplitudes is just the <i>method</i> in quantum mechanics. It&#x27;s like knowing what a derivative is to obtain exponential population growth. That&#x27;s just mathematics. No one says people who have solved dN/dt=aN predict that bacteria will grow exponentially, it&#x27;s just how a system acts like that would behave, and we found an example.<p>But, I&#x27;ve thought a little more about it, I think my original comment was touching a personal bias more than making an argument. I asked, &quot;why does the time evolution operator have to be on a fock space and why do P and X commute like ~i?&quot; I&#x27;m not sure physics can answer beyond that at this point, since it matches experiment, we should or could just accept it the way it is.<p>May be there is no &quot;deeper&quot; reason after all.",1422075726
