The author doesn&#x27;t like the design of Angular and feels it isn&#x27;t efficient enough. OK, that&#x27;s OK! However, there&#x27;s not some massive conspiracy here -  go ahead, use React/Ember. In my own experience, Angular is performant enough for most web applications, and the convenience the framework offers makes up for a lot of the crazy, weird things it does to achieve that API.<p>But to each his own.",1420297182

If the first line is, for example, &#x27;#!/usr/bin/env python&#x27;, then the desugared file has three imports at the top of the file and the shebang line after those imports. It would be nice to preserve the shebang line as the first line (and maybe also to make the desugared file executable if the input file was executable).<p>Second, the desugaring doesn&#x27;t ignore commented out lines, as I discovered on commenting out a line like<p><pre><code>    #ps.p(&quot;my test: &quot; + foo)
</code></pre>
before noticing the optional label parameter. Trying to run a file with that line or desugar it results in an IndexError.",1420297135

You could easily have one entry point class with a bunch of ready to use functions and start your docs off there. Otherwise, you&#x27;re just punting the discovery problem up a level. There&#x27;s also a benefit in having multiple things in a module.

Smithy share the story behind the scenes of Koprol to why Yahoo! worked on the intersection of communication and location with payments far before the days of LINE and WeChat.
