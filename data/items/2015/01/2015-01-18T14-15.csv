Nick Ashford and I observed the same patterns of inexplicable new-onset intolerances across very different toxic exposures in over a dozen countries. Sheep dippers using organophosphate pesticides in rural areas of Europe, radiology workers inhaling chemicals while developing films in New Zealand, Gulf War veterans, EPA workers in a remodeled and poorly ventilated office building in 1987, cleanup crews breathing fumes after oil spills. Many would get ill, and a small percentage never recovered. They became exquisitely sensitized, as well as disabled.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really sound that crazy to me.  People working with industrial chemicals need protection.  This is a widely known and accepted fact.

8907622,comment,8906331,8907496,0,0,jerf,,,"I agree and have made that point before. Java tried to be a language for &quot;enterprise programming&quot;, which tried to keep the language so simple that having lots of people wouldn&#x27;t muck up your code. IMHO, it failed epically at this, and today we would basically laugh at the idea that Java is good at that, but it was in fact a design criterion back in the day. One could make the case that it sort of succeeded at the isolation bit, but at the cost of making everything so verbose that it&#x27;s absurd and a constant stream of technologies to deal with this has been coming out for Java ever since.<p>Despite the taint Java left on it, it&#x27;s actually a good idea! It&#x27;s a common use case. After years of programming in Perl in a fairly large programmer environment I can see the virtue of the idea of using a simpler language helping keep a lot of programmers in sync in their code base, instead of living in a world where I can look at the source and virtually instantly tell both when and who it came from due to <i>massive</i> differences in dialect. But Java seems to have failed <i>so badly</i> that it soured everyone on the entire idea, and nobody has tried since.<p>I think Go actually has a better chance at this, not for any large reason but for a series of smaller ones. Defaulting to object composition, once you understand it, is a powerful-yet-simpler approach to putting objects together than inheritance, and makes it much easier to both use the objects of others and to create objects to use for others, because you don&#x27;t need to worry about what will be F&#x27;ed up in the &quot;child classes&quot;, as there is no such thing. Implicitly satisfied interfaces don&#x27;t sound like they&#x27;d be a big change over Java, in practice it&#x27;s night-and-day to be able to declare interfaces that are automatically satisfied by <i>objects you don&#x27;t control</i>. Contrast how many ways there are to write the same Go function as there is to write it in, say, Scala. And writing some decent multithreading primitives into the core is probably a good idea for this use case, too.<p>It won&#x27;t happen tomorrow or next year, but, arguably, rather than Rust or even Python, the language that Go is the biggest threat to in the long term is Java. And it&#x27;s a threat for precisely the reasons that people on HN tend to complain about. Indeed, I <i>personally</i> have the same objections that most HN&#x27;ers do for personal usage, but right now bar none Go is the language I&#x27;d most like to work in, precisely because it was written for the Google use case which also happens to be the one I have.",1421592004

So you can either buy a $1 lottery ticket that wins $1000 for 0.01% time, or sell a $1 lottery ticket to one counterparty that may only be redeemed for $1000 for 0.01% of time.<p>So for the lottery buyer, you know you&#x27;re going to lose most of the time; so you size your bets accordingly to your expected value (formally known as Kelly&#x27;s Criterion) to ensure that you still have enough stake while you&#x27;re losing most of the time to keep betting and win in the long run when your loss rate regresses to the mean probability.<p>Likewise, the lottery seller&#x27;s P&L profile is like an insurance disaster company. On most days, you steadily collect the insurance premium from your policyholders. But you have to size your &quot;risk pool&quot; and watch it carefully to ensure that you are well-capitalized to be able to pay out insurance claims when disasters hit. And if your expected value, again with Kelly&#x27;s is no longer viable, you&#x27;ll have to either sell your insurance policies to another trader or buy a hedge to re-insure yourself (formally known as keeping delta, gamma or vega neutral depending on the risk type in the options market).<p>Nassim Taleb&#x27;s strategy involves mostly buying option straddles on indices and also large-cap blue chips. With options, based on expiration date and the current market&#x27;s implied volatility, he can pick and choose accordingly the daily &quot;loss rate&quot; he is willing to take and also more importantly, what he thinks the market&#x27;s &quot;real volatility&quot; level should be over the current &quot;implied volatility&quot; expressed in the options pricing.<p>So by sizing his bets properly, choosing an option series that limits his daily decay and expresses his opinion about volatility, he is able to make money over the long run (e.g., 2008 when the market mispriced volatility and VIX shot up to 200 and SPY went down a lot; his straddle gained in both implied and realized volatility).",1421591035
