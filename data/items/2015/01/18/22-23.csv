8909334,comment,8909195,8909195,0,0,bmh100,,,"The point the author brings up about the lack of Lisp modules in 2005 is an interesting one and reminds me of the article &quot;Why Perl Didn&#x27;t Win&quot;, posted within the last few days. Browsing clojars.org, a Clojure repository, reveals that there are 11,435 libraries at the time of my writing. That is a great improvement, vastly exceeding the author&#x27;s positive example of Python&#x27;s 249 modules at the time. PyPI, a Python repository, currently lists 54,060, so clearly Python is still much more popular than Clojure. Yet, the 11K Clojure libraries seems to be a direct contradiction to his statement: &quot;And lisp modules? Well, every part of the code can modify every other part. You can write a whole new grammar if you&#x27;re so inclined. None of this helps with the goal of downloading a random package and easily calling whatever you want from it with minimal hassle. There&#x27;s just a fundamental conflict between easy modularity on the one hand, which requires lots of restrictions and boring standard forms, and fluid modifiability on the other.&quot; The Clojure community has made great strides in promoting the adoption of a Lisp among programmers and enterprises.",1421621982

8909324,comment,8908053,8908053,0,0,halfcat,,,"The article &quot;Is There Anything Good About Men?&quot; by Roy Baumeister [1] takes some interesting angles on the reasons and motivations for men choosing war, and generalizes why the worlds most powerful people, as well as the overwhelming majority of most prison populations, are men.<p>In some ways, the reasons look to clearly stem from culture and society&#x27;s influence, as discussed in the Baumeister article.<p>On the other hand, there is definitely a some element of the innate [2] &quot;us vs. them&quot; at play, allowed to run unbridled in the suspenseful environment of war. I imagine this <i>would</i> result in an experience not easily replicated in the real world.<p>No where else offers this:<p>1. You might get to kill &quot;bad people&quot;<p>2. You won&#x27;t get in trouble for it<p>3. You don&#x27;t have time to think or process it. It just happens, split second, you die or they die, you panic, resort to your training, you live. Instead of being punished, you are a hero.<p>4. You might die. Hearing a bullet whiz by your head and surviving, followed by the subsequent huge adrenaline rush.<p>5. If you don&#x27;t die, you see yourself as an invincible super hero that gets to save the world.<p>There are ways to replicate a lot of this, like joining a street gang or getting involved in organized crime, but instead of becoming a hero, you get 20-to-life. Not quite the same risk-reward.<p>Something about it seems very juvenile, in the sense of getting to do &quot;bad things&quot; with very little risk of negative consequence, and there&#x27;s some element of &quot;playing super hero&quot; here. It makes me think of going off to college and partying your ass off for a semester, with unlimited access to alcohol and sex, fully funded by the parents, with very little negative consequence. I&#x27;m sure many people <i>do</i> look back on that with fond memories. To some people, war is probably like that, on steroids.<p>[1] <a href=""http://denisdutton.com/baumeister.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://denisdutton.com/baumeister.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/news/babies-help-unlock-the-origins-of-morality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/babies-help-unlock-the-origins-o...</a>",1421621720

Unguided weapons miss their targets, almost always. As a result you need to mass together and fire large numbers of them to hit even one target with any reliability. Also, because of the large numbers needed and the need to fire them near the target (because accuracy decreases as distance increases), they become a valuable target, vulnerable to the enemy.<p>Nuclear weapons solved these problems (with a some serious drawbacks). One weapon will do the job, and its blast area is so large that accuracy is unimportant.<p>(Modern guided weapons also solve many of these problems).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cnas.org/20YY-Preparing-War-in-Robotic-Age"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnas.org/20YY-Preparing-War-in-Robotic-Age</a>",1421619936

That sounds like a no-brainer, but that&#x27;s probably just as important as market value.<p>For example, I was contracting a company that had most of their software development teams working as contractors.  About 6 months into contracting there, I learned that they had made a strategic decision to try and hire everybody instead of contracting and the reason they did that was to save on money and more importantly, retention.<p>So they would ask me to convert, and I would pretty much blow them off for a couple months, and they would ask me again a couple months later.  So after a few times of this routine, I knew I was in a better position to start the negotiations.  Also, I had waited for several other contractors to convert and got some tidbits from them.<p>At the end of the day, I negotiated for much more than average salary in my market.<p>If you&#x27;re contracting, it pays to be contracting with a staffing firm that knows the decision makers in the company.",1421619228

People picnicked beside the first Civil War battles. Needless to say, they soon learned of their mistakes. Similarly many Americans were excited for the second Iraq war. (And those examples hardly are unusual.)<p>* Civilians and soldiers who die, are maimed, are raped, are tortured, who see those things happen to family members, or lose their homes, jobs, assets, or see their nations and communities reduced to chaos and poverty,  -- they do not love war.<p>* Those who kill and see others kill usually do not love war. What we compel soldiers to do is horrible, killing is unnatural and damaging to the killer too. We&#x27;ve made others into torturers [2] -- what if you were made to torture or kill someone? War costs many survivors their souls and peace of mind. Read any history of any war&#x27;s aftermath, including our recent conflicts: Those who return often are not the same. PTSD is widespread, and note the very high number of suicides currently among our soldiers, despite the recent conflicts being among the safest, lowest-intensity wars in American history.<p>* Those who have experienced prior wars came out of them seeking to end war for ever, for example after WWI (the League of Nations) and WWII (the United Nations and the predecessors to the European Union). Some today mock these people as idealistic, but these were the people who led us to victory in existential wars -- they knew far more of war&#x27;s reality than we ever will.<p>The glorification of war, military, and soldiers is highly irresponsible and dangerous. We consign soldiers, affected civilians, and whole nations to nightmarish horrors, and then glorify it so we don&#x27;t have to think about what we have done.

If there&#x27;s a chance a value creating employee will leave, there is no reason not to give a raise.
