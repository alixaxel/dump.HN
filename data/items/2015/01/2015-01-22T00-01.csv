The change of state in your brain modulates the thing that it both creates and controls (consciousness) state to &quot;feel&quot; pain.<p>Consciousness is a emergent property of the incredible complex organ we call a brain. At first it may seem too odd to think that something as incredibly surreal and deep as consciousness can spring forth some arrangement of atoms, atoms identical to those make up the inanimate objects around us, it because less weird when you think about a car just being made up of nuts, bolts, and a bunch of metal, or a space shuttle out of ceramic, composites and what have you. Computers are just made up of transistors, capacitors and the like, and have tremendous capabilities.<p>Humans are just the most extreme example we have of this phenomenon of complexity through composition, but that makes a certain kind of sense as humans are the product of billions of years of evolution. We&#x27;ve only been seriously studying consciousness for a good hundred years or so (people have thought about it for quite some time, but I think it&#x27;s fair to say no clear progress was made on the subject until the 20th century).",1421888370

However, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s true. From an evolutionary standpoint, biological intelligence developed naturally because biological components are natural. Furthermore, machines do not develop when left in isolation, while biological organisms do. If you leave a large population of simple machines running in an environment, this is overwhelmingly not likely to result in a machine intelligence millions of years later. Machines were developed by humans and do not develop in the same way; comparing the two as in your Intelligent Design argument doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>I do not think artificial intelligence can arise naturally because its components are not natural. This discussion could also foster a discussion on two other interesting questions:<p>1. Does intelligence require organic components that operate in a deterministic way (i.e. the brain) to transcend it from merely a &quot;machine&quot;?<p>2. If intelligence requires biology, where do you draw the line between creating an intelligence through natural human reproduction and creating an artificial intelligence another way?<p>Personally, I believe artificial intelligence does not require biological components, and I believe that under certain circumstances, it could develop unintentionally from a relatively advanced computer, but that is not the same as naturally.",1421888233

Yes, it works. Is it any good? That&#x27;s a much harder question to answer.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;I say this in the nicest way possible: Using Microsoft HoloLens kinda stinks. In its current form, it feels like someone is tightening your head into a vice. The model being shown today on Microsoft&#x27;s Redmond, Washington, campus isn&#x27;t what you saw onstage, but a development kit. The demos begin by lowering a tethered, relatively small, rectangular computer over your head, which hangs around your neck by sling.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;You can literally feel the heat coming off the computer&#x27;s fans, which face upward. It feels like you&#x27;re wearing a computer around your neck, because you are.&quot;</i><p>There doesn&#x27;t seem to be full hand tracking (as suggested by the demo on stage). Instead it uses something they call AirTap which uses gaze for pointing and hand only for clicking:<p><i>&quot;By looking at any of them and using &quot;AirTap&quot; (hold up your hand in front of your eyes, tap with your pointer finger), I could select any contact to call.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;While the effects of interaction were impressive, the actual interaction was less so. Rather than picking up a sheep with my hand by literally just grabbing it with my actual hand, my only means of interaction were voice (pickaxe! redstone torch! etc.) and the aforementioned &quot;AirTap.&quot;</i><p>Overall impression is kinda mixed (especially compared to how well were received even very crude Oculus Rift early prototypes):<p><i>&quot;HoloLens is clearly very early, and kinda sucks right now. It&#x27;s uncomfortable. It&#x27;s cumbersome. It looks and feels like a piece of hardware that&#x27;s far from final.&quot;</i><p><i>&quot;Is it bad? No. Lord no. Stop it.

For instance, he mentions &quot;creativity&quot; as a stumbling block for AGI, but there is a whole class of existing algorithms that exhibit prototypical creativity, namely generative models.<p>Essentially, the idea is that &quot;creativity&quot; is the act of sampling from a distribution over the kind of thing you are trying to create. Learning algorithms like Boltzmann Machines will learn a distribution over the inputs they see. One thing you can do with such a distribution is checking the probability of a given input under it, which may be good to classify them. Another thing you might want to do is generate <i>representative samples</i>, i.e. generate an example E with probability X iff P(E) = X under the model. The latter is what I would call &quot;creativity&quot;.<p>Under this definition, creativity depends on both the learned distribution (which should only assign high probability to meaningful data) and of course on the sampling algorithm. As it turns out, it is very hard to write good sampling algorithms for non-trivial distributions (naive MCMC will often get stuck). So creativity <i>is</i> hard, but so are a lot of other tasks, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to single it out.",1421886742

One thing I&#x27;ve learned from discussions about physics is that the thought processes that are common to software development are largely foreign in the realm of physics.<p>Take for example Einstein&#x27;s Relativity of Simultaneity thought experiment. [1] This is akin to discussion about a bug among software developers. Like developers can agree that a bug exists after discussion alone, a software developer could read the thought experiment and conclude there&#x27;s a bug in physics (i.e. the general consensus at the time). But physicists don&#x27;t seem to work that way. In discussions with many super smart physics-minded people, I&#x27;ve found that most reject that thought experiment, nay <i>any</i> thought experiment, as having value. Only a mathematically-based argument suffices for them. Imagine showing software bugs only mathematically!<p>[1] In Einstein&#x27;s words: <a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/173/9.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bartleby.com/173/9.html</a>",1421886330

Certainly no paper consisting only of a thought experiment could get published in a top journal. Many self-described physicists have told me that thought experiments have zero scientific value. Brian Greene who wrote <i>The Elegant Universe</i> says he thinks Einstein&#x27;s original papers would&#x27;ve been round-filed if submitted today. (And they weren&#x27;t just thought experiments.) I suspect we know about Einstein today only because of the open-mindedness of Max Planck, who was Einstein&#x27;s original reviewer.",1421885008

The article talks about triple pane windows and thick walls.  Are these stick-frame houses with fiberglass and offset 2x6s in the walls or something like that, or are there new materials?  I recently read that aerogel has been coming down in cost to the point where it&#x27;s plausible that someone with deep pockets might insulate their house with it if they didn&#x27;t want super thick walls.  Insulated concrete forms and autoclaved aerated concrete are also something that some builders use.  What else is new?",1421884989
