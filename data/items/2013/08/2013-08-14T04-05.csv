I don&#x27;t but I have a trustworthy mechanic that does it for me and I don&#x27;t have to suffer the inflated prices of my car&#x27;s manufacturer. This is even more important for transportation companies that have their own mechanics, just as many companies have their own IT department.<p>On the <i>quality</i> of Windows my experience has not been the same. For me working with it is like death by a few thousand cuts. Skipping over the fact that the developer tools that I need do not work well on Windows, every time I had problems I could find no way to debug what happens, so really the standard is to just reformat and install everything from scratch. How IT departments live with Windows I&#x27;ll never know.",1376456206

Or sometimes it&#x27;s vice-versa.<p>And that &quot;unfairness&quot; in an initial even stock split will come back to haunt the company, since certain founders are not being rewarded justly for their contributions, and will come to resent it later.

The &quot;freedoms&quot; being looked at here are simply being given to different people: the GPL restricts freedoms of developers working with th software to provide and guarantee freedoms among the end users f that software; on the opposite side, BSD-licensed software tends to give developers more freedom, but the freedoms they are given are specifically for and really narrowly able to be used with the one purpose of later restricting freedoms of others. The question, thereby, comes down to which freedoms are more important and how many of each kind of consumer there are, in an attempt to define which philosophy provides more freedom. Advocates of GPL would say that there will always be more end users than developers, and that their freedoms are porbably more important anyway, so the GPL provides more essential &quot;freedom&quot;, even as it is actively defined in a way that &quot;restricts freedom&quot;, in the same way as we usually like to think the emancipation proclamation brought &quot;freedom&quot; even though it really was stating that slave owners had to give up some freedom: its all about perspective.",1376454765

Without huge capital upgrades (which are infeasible, and would be well more than $10b per airport due to surroundings), you can&#x27;t really handle more planes.  It makes more sense to use SFO slots to fly to NRT than to LAX.  You use smaller planes for SFO-LAX than you do for SFO-NRT, too (although I guess you could use something like those crazy high-capacity Japanese 747s, maybe with turboprops...)<p>2) On the SF side, there&#x27;s a reasonably well developed infrastructure of public transit to tie in.<p>3) Hell yes I&#x27;d drive or BART/Caltrain from San Jose up to SF to take a 35 minute TSA-free ground level trip from SF to LA.  If I could do SF to Las Vegas in 55 minutes with a 5 minute layover, I&#x27;d be even happier.   The alternatives are a 5-7 hour drive in my own car, or an equivalent ground travel to an airport, pain with TSA, flight.<p>4) There are specific routes (downtown SF to LA, LA to Las Vegas) where there really are essentially huge volumes of people who want to swap location frequently.  This doesn&#x27;t replace <i>all air travel</i>, it just replaces those routes.",1376454373

6209922,comment,6208419,6209796,5,0,JoshTriplett,,,"There are two answers to that.<p>The more relevant one for the current discussion: people who use and identify with the term &quot;Free Software&quot; generally care about software freedom as a valuable principle independent of its practical benefits (in other words, software should be free because it&#x27;s wrong to restrict developers&#x27; ability to use, copy, modify, and distribute it), while people who use and identify with the term &quot;Open Source&quot; generally care most about the practical benefits (software should be open because that&#x27;s the most effective and efficient way to produce software).  There&#x27;s a great deal of overlap between those two communities, but in general those two terms imply a different set of underlying principles held by the speaker.  People who want to be all-inclusive sometimes say &quot;Free and Open Source Software&quot; or FOSS.<p>The origins of that distinction come from the original creation of the term &quot;Open Source&quot;, often described as a marketing campaign for Free Software: the term often helps win over people (and businesses) who are unconvinced by software freedom as a principle but highly convinced by the effectiveness of Open Source as a software development model.<p>In terms of literal definition, Free Software is defined by the Free Software Foundation&#x27;s &quot;four freedoms&quot; (<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>): use/run, study/modify, redistribute, and redistribute modified versions.  Open Source is defined by the Open Source Initiative&#x27;s Open Source Definition (<a href=""http://opensource.org/osd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.org/osd</a>), which in turn was derived from the Debian project&#x27;s &quot;Debian Free Software Guidelines&quot; (DFSG, <a href=""http://www.debian.org/social_contract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.debian.org/social_contract</a>).  In practice, almost every license that passes one definition passes the other; it&#x27;s exceedingly rare to find a license that&#x27;s actually Open Source but not Free Software or vice versa.<p>Also worth noting: both terms are unfortunately ambiguous, in that &quot;free software&quot; (especially when not capitalized) can be confused with software available for no fee, and &quot;open source&quot; can be confused with software with source available but not under an Open Source license.",1376453988
