The ""cult of the new"" you might call it.<p>In reality almost all new tech, even that which is a good general replacement for something older, involves tradeoffs.  Sometimes the bad points outweigh the good ones for use-cases slightly out of the mainstream.  In other cases, the advantages of the new tech simply aren't great enough to warrant replacing something you already own.<p>[I own a (small) old CRT TV.  A new LCD TV might be neat and appeal to my gadget instinct, but ... why bother?  I don't really use it so much, and the old one works well enough.

That's how the government will collect the upside. If Tesla doesn't do as well, the government will also collect the (deferred) upside through stocks. The only way the government can lose is if Tesla goes bankrupt. That way the government can make their profits on all the businesses that don't fail, rather than just 1-2 smashing successes.<p>There's also the taxes the government collects through suppliers to Tesla, as well as sales taxes generated when consumers purchase electric vehicles, etc, taxes from capital gains and dividends of tesla stock, taxes from salary taxes.<p>I'm simplifying here because I haven't talked about the opportunity cost of the taxes from a petrol car the consumer didn't buy or the other job employees could have held. In general, however, the government will profit as long as value of taxes from economic growth and other benefits exceed the cost of the loan. And remember, for the government, the cost of the loan isn't for taxpayers to bear, but for all holders of US dollars, which include foreign nations and other non-taxpayers, through temporary inflation; Since the government can always print money to lend, and destroy money when the money is repaid, unless the business fails, in which case every US dollar holding person suffers.<p>Overdoing it, however, will mean displacing existing investors who are arguably better posed to select winners and negatively affect the economy. What I am saying is some level of government intervention may actually be profitable for taxpayers, even if the investment structure doesn't appear so on the surface.<p>It's like the ""Why do governments invest in loss-making airlines?""

Of course, this example isn't exactly something you'd usually see in actual code (heck, it's probably even bad practice in most situations) BUT the point here is that while most of python might be compatible with this, there exists some inconsistencies that causes one's previously working python code to fail (and these bugs would probably be very difficult to trace). Of course, Brython is still young and has time to hopefully fix these issues. (In fact, this is the second time I've tried this project. Back then they didn't even have the chaining feature working, so it's nice that they are making progress.)",1370159284

These kids will move to SV and consume existing technologies, in the sense that they will follow a couple of a rails tutorials and build the ""next great webservice"" by combining a couple of the patterns they've learned and create a twitter-bootstrap website that goes along with it.

The problem is that advanced development require understanding of speech recognition internals, close cooperation with engine developers and hard user interface testing.<p>Here is the list of features one have to implement to provide even basic user experience:<p>1. Implement and test proper keyword spotting for voice activation. This feature is missing in Julius engine and all workarounds which are used do not provide enough accuracy.<p>2. Implement invisible speaker detection/online adaptation to deal with environment issues. With adaptation accuracy is extremely high for a few speakers. You can easily dictate free form speech.<p>3. Implement free-form speech. This part require data collection and native language understanding work.<p>4. Implement a framework to detect microphone and noise issues. Microphone issues like clipping are a major source of accuracy problems in speech recognition. Most engines do not care about proper microphone.<p>5. Provide an easy way to add new commands with no training and no knowledge of phonetics. This reqiures G2P component which converts unknown words to phonemes like the one provided by CMUSphinx.<p>6. Implement dialog management and error correction. So that user can not just run queries but have a conversation with the application. Interstingly, that requires update of the previous engine results and analysis of n-best lists or lattices.<p>So I hope someone would start doing real work on speech interfaces with close cooperation with engine developers. That would create amazing things to demonstrate.",1370157924

At the same time, what was questioned originally was the operation of that corporation and it's people, and that's what i responded to :)<p>As for the adoption of the motto: The original outside publication of this was done while going public, and was intended to make clear to wall street that Google wasn't going to maximize profit at the expense of everything else, where everything else usually involves doing morally questionable things.<p>I think you read way too much into it.<p>""But I do not for a second believe that Google's executives are so much better than all other good people running large corporations that actually do evil.

If I am not planning cross compilation, what other advantage compiling to C has? I can bundle the runtime to produce a standalone executable in case of racket as well(""raco exe"" and ""raco dist"").
