5899578,comment,5897834,5899354,1,0,stiff,,,"The problem is that the answers you are looking for are of philosophical nature and not of scientific one (you talk about &quot;demystifying&quot; consciousness, &quot;elucidating it&quot;). The neural correlates might not clarify what consciousness is, but they might yield answers to precise scientific questions, such as: what brain activity is necessary and sufficient for a person to be able demonstrate self- or world- awareness. We might need to first answer to such questions <i>before</i> we gain any new insights of more philosophical nature. I am not saying this method is the silver bullet, but certainly I cannot agree the results are meaningless or &quot;only reaffirm our prejudices&quot;.<p>My only point is really that the lack of a great definition of consciousness doesn&#x27;t diminish the value of research like the one cited here.",1371567585

Suppose that a car costs $25k new.  Then manufacture might cost $15k, amortized R&D might be $5k, and profit $5k.  After 3 years the car might be worth $15k and the projected lifetime value of being able to try to resell that used, fix, etc might be $5k.  Using these made up numbers, profits and lifetime value are about balanced.  Unfortunately for the car owner, resource allocation decisions are entirely based on marginal costs.  R&D is not a marginal cost - it is a sunk one.  Thus selling a new car adds 2x as much to the bottom line as the lifetime value of maintaining it longer.  Guess what gets discarded?<p>Remember, this is the industry which inspired the term &quot;built-in obsolescence&quot;.

First you upload an arduino reference design into the FPGA and continue working normally.  This takes up about 1% of the FPGA gates, and leaves about 200 unused I/O pins (depending on FPGA device of course) and it probably runs faster than the real thing.  (It also probably draws about 10 times the current...).<p>Next, instead of you writing a bit-banged I2C interface, you download, include, configure, and synthesize a smart semi-intelligent I2C peripheral into your synthetic arduino on a I/O pin that doesn&#x27;t exist in the real thing.  Now your arduino source code to debug shrunk by perhaps 200 lines and the I2C is faster.  Now your FPGA is 2% full and 98% empty.<p>Hmm, what if instead of polling that pin in my arduino and/or going interrupt based, I simply included a whole picoblaze CPU core to do nothing but baby sit that input pin while outputting the correct servo signal... And the arduino sets it up and controls it as a very smart peripheral.  Well, download, include, configure, synth, upload... Now your FPGA is like 7% used and 93% empty.<p>Eventually your virtual arduino does pretty much nothing but UI.  You can replace that with a CPU core of your choosing and OS and language of your choosing, simply upload it instead of the virtual arduino.<p>Repeat a zillion iterations and thats how you started with an arduino and ended up with a MIPS UI written in C++ (why?  Why not?) controlling a 8051 based thermostat coprocessor using a smart I2C controller to talk to the temp sensor and a smart servo pulsetrain generator to automatically make the servo signal.<p>Or perhaps it gradually iteratively moves from an arduino to what amounts to a specific model of the MIPS based Microchip PIC32.  Why?  Who knows maybe you want a single chip $3 solution instead of an $30 arduino solution, or a $300 FPGA solution.  Because your FPGA model of a PIC32 is pretty close to the real thing, the porting of your software from the virtual PIC32 to a real PIC32 only takes 15 minutes or so...  So you end up not actually using a FPGA in the final product even though it started with an Arduino and ended up on a PIC32.",1371566702

With the right philosophical treatment there <i>might</i> be hope of reconciliation, but without it the concept is just going to remain magical, without meaningful conclusions.<p>Aether is a great example, one I had in mind.

You can only establish that a package is unused in this package after looking at all code in this package. Hence, you only can only recognize that a package is unused <i>after</i> you have looked at it.<p>Yes, you can avoid generating code for that package.

If a library is defining more operators than you like, then don&#x27;t use it.  That is no different than a library defining functions with names you don&#x27;t like, it happens in every language.<p>2. Why on earth would string concatenation be the same operator as addition?  That isn&#x27;t the same operation.  I want to know if I used + that I have to have gotten a number, or else it won&#x27;t compile.  Getting a string would be very unhelpful.  If you just want any monoid, then there is a generic operator for that, it is <> or mappend.<p>5. The different types are for different purposes.  String is a list of chars.  You use normal list functions on it.  Bytestring is not a string, it is an efficient container for storing bytes.  It is used for things like networking.  Text is an encoding aware, efficient representation of strings.  Use this for text data.  There is an IsString typeclass for generic functions that operate on any type that can behave like a string.<p>7.

Specifically it is addressing &quot;Work Product&quot; which is what you are producing for the client.  So yes, if they are sued over something you deliver because you snagged images off the web and didn&#x27;t pay for them, or you used someones IP without a proper license then yea they can hold you liable and make you pay some of their expenses.  In general, a corporation isn&#x27;t going to trust you to fight on its behalf, so this is more about you being a witness and paying expenses and damages if you infringed.<p>And you are right, you could do everything right and someone comes along and sues your client.  That is why professional liability insurance etc is a must anymore.  Not that it is a fix for this, but in the off chance, at least you have some protection from financial ruin. And in general, I always deliver to the client any licenses I purchased on their behalf (or a resale license), as well as details on any third party software or designs I used. And even before I use any 3rd party code, images etc that requires a license I always make sure the client signs off on it if it is core to some piece of functionality.  This way they are aware during development and at time of delivery of what I used and why.  This doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t make you hold them harmless, but it sure does help if you ever had to go to mediation or court.",1371565470

Searching for ‘taxi’ in the app store brings you over a thousand options. From p2p solutions like Hailo and myTaxi to the private hire luxury of Uber and Black Lane, everyone wants a piece of the market.<p>Now, it seems that all passenger transport providers are longing for their own branded apps to keep up with the ongoing trend. A few taxi dispatch software companies have made white-label \nversions available, but they come at a cost. One charges £20,000 for the premium app, plus monthly charges. While they rub their hands together at the prospect of this new revenue stream, Berlin-based startup T Dispatch have an alternative solution which might ruffle their feathers.<p>T Dispatch are due to release the code for their open-source taxi app this month. As an additional product to their web-based dispatch system and driver apps for iOS / Android, they answered demand from a rapidly evolving industry. There are thousands of minicab, taxi and limo companies who feel threatened by big brand apps, but can’t afford to compete. By subscribing to T Dispatch, these fleets have free access to the booking app source code, which they can then customise and develop for themselves to increase customer loyalty and brand awareness.<p>Resolved to keep their focus on software solutions, T Dispatch have publicly promised never to own any passenger-facing brand. Rather than competing, they offer an open API to integrate \ntheir dispatch system with any customer-facing app, with a vision of aggregating all channels \ninto one platform for the fleets. The enterprising startup has grown from 3 to 20 employees in just 1 year, with substantial seed investment behind them.",1371564913

Regardless of reason, here&#x27;s some filled in blind spots:<p>One important ignored aspect is you can treat the FPGA as a magic universal microcontroller.  Oh, you need 3 UARTs now, I&#x27;ll INCLUDE another at a different I/O addrs.  And you&#x27;d like a CANbus now?  No problemo in 10 minutes you&#x27;ll be programming on the same hardware now with a CANbus.  Oh you don&#x27;t want to use a Z80 anymore, fine I&#x27;ll compile the FPGA to be some pic variant in 5 minutes, or a microblaze, or whatever you want as a CPU core.  As long as you slowly successively approximate real available microcontroller hardware, you can ease the eventual port off the FPGA to some microcontroller hardware that costs $1.50 in qty instead of $15.00 in qty.  Its a lot easier, faster, and cheaper to upload a bitstream to a FPGA than to solder in a different microcontroller hardware.  This makes device selection during development much less critical/scary.  You don&#x27;t have to sit in paralysis wondering if you need 3 or 4 I2C busses.<p>Another thing is not mentioning the open development community.  Most HN readers probably hang out at github.  The place where most FPGA folks hang out is opencores.org.  People who exclusively hang out on github are going to wonder why &quot;no one&quot; is using FPGAs and theres &quot;nothing out there&quot; and &quot;not much activity&quot;.  Well come on over to opencores and you&#x27;ll get more than a lifetime of entertainment ahead of you, for free...  Its like going to CPAN and hanging out with CPAN people and wondering why &quot;no one&quot; uses Python.  Looking in wrong spot.  Need a more target rich environment.<p>You can do a lot of &quot;stuff&quot; with FPGAs as the underlying technology without doing much of anything with HDLs.  Much as I once programmed on a Silicon on Sapphire CPU a long time ago, but the underlying technology simply didn&#x27;t matter at the assembly language level.  I&#x27;m sure it was very exciting on the factory floor and in the R+D labs, but I wasn&#x27;t there, so I didn&#x27;t much care.  In a similar way you can synth up a perfectly good 6502 and give it twenty semi-intelligent ethernet interfaces without too much HDL effort and then just do your &quot;software thing&quot; on the synthesized device without touching the HDL.<p>Tying it all together, you&#x27;ll get people outside the community reinventing the wheel, trying to slowly and methodically invent the concept, purpose, and implementation of the WISHBONE interconnect bus standard or something like that.  Well, all that stuff got figured out and implemented inside the community like a decade ago, so...

Cars needed a lot of repairs, so local dealers to service them made sense.<p>- During the Great Depression, car manufacturers continued to make cars despite no one buying them.  So they forced dealerships to purchase cars, or else get banned from selling their brand ever again (effectively terminating the business, obviously bad if you have loans and other capital investments).  This was before overseas competition from Japanese/Korean manufacturers existed, so losing your contract to Ford meant you were pretty sunk.<p>- Dealerships fought back by getting legislation passed to protect them legally, slowly granting more power to the dealerships over time.  Now the balance of power is far, far on the side of dealers - manufacturers cannot shut down dealerships, cannot control who runs them, must provide cars to dealers even if they are in poorly profitable areas, cannot tell the dealers what to sell, no real way to incentive dealers to not be &quot;car salesmen&quot; assholes,  etc etc.",1371564300

For whatever reason, the fit was way tighter than normal and I literally had to put some of my body weight over the thing to get it to slide in. All the while, just wondering how I was going to explain to Joe Perry that I had snapped a $6k Pro Tools card in half. Luckily, I didn&#x27;t have to.",1371564171

The whole point about Ghostery is: they want to collect data about the whole industry, which industry people want. So they design Ghostery to collect that data and have an opt-in anonymous feedback to them.<p>You can see that they are not trying to block the ads because the ability to block new trackers by default is absent from the setup wizard. You have to go to the advanced settings via the separate plugin settings to get that.<p>Again, Ghostery doesn&#x27;t collect your personal browsing history unless you opt-in. The fact that it is proprietary means we can&#x27;t absolutely verify this, which is a concern.
