5925651,comment,5925100,5925454,6,0,lukifer,,,"> ...any more than clapping in a movie theatre will communicate your pleasure to the cast and crew of the movie.<p>I know you&#x27;re trying to illustrate via absurdity, but such things do have real impact. Each member of the theater shares the clapping experience and absorbs the social capital of how good the movie is, giving them a metric for recommending the movie to friends without risk of embarrassing themselves. If they loved the movie but hear no applause or other corroboration, their enthusiasm for spreading positive buzz about the movie is vastly diminished. (&quot;Yeah, it was okay, I guess.&quot; doesn&#x27;t put asses in seats.) Meanwhile, the cast and crew receive feedback based on the ticket sales created by word of mouth, which still remains the most powerful marketing tool in existence.<p>It&#x27;s easy to blame &quot;the news cycle&quot; for allowing important issues to fall into the memory hole, but I say We The People are equally culpable. The line must be drawn here, on a matter so fundamental to the nature of state power in a newly digital world, and in a rare case where the voters and ideologies of both parties are mostly in agreement, even if their leaders are too cowardly to stand up.",1371945485

Conspiracy theories like this are always easy to laugh at until there&#x27;s enough proof to tip you off that there&#x27;s actually something happening.

I really hope that a lot of the world&#x27;s problems are caused by a cartel of a few bad suits. That way when the dust settles, either the world is a better place, or we at least know who led us to this place.<p>A few things in the article (Oh just go read it, it&#x27;s not that long) that need some discussion:<p>> &quot;there are even plans in place to impose martial law in the United States, she said.&quot;<p>Really?

We need to hack the car to accept some kind of remote control. This will require hacking at least the steering, the engine, and the brakes. We need all three because to ensure killing. If he can control one of them, he has a good chance of making the accident non-fatal.<p>After we&#x27;ve got the car hacked and can remotely control it, we need to actually cause the accident. There are a couple of approaches here. One is to follow him around in our control vehicle into an opportunity arises. The other is to wait at some place that we know he is likely to go and that is a good place to make a fatal accident happen.<p>After we&#x27;ve cause an accident, our problem with him is not yet solved. We still have to worry that someone will decide his death was not an accident, examine the car, find that it was tampered with, and maybe tie that to us. Even if it only leads to people we hired and we were competent enough to leave nothing that links them to us, we lose those contractors for future work.<p>So, what can go wrong with this plan?<p>First, we&#x27;ve got to do the car hacking. Even if steering, engine, and braking are all &quot;fly by wire&quot; on his car, they are likely to be separate systems. We are going to have to rig all three of them for remote control. We&#x27;ll probably need to install some hardware for the remote control.<p>Any suspicious contact with the target before killing him is risky, and right off the bat this plan involves complicated fucking around inside his car.<p>If we do get his car rigged, then we have to actually take over and cause the accident. The &quot;follow him around hoping for an opportunity&quot; approach is not good. He could go weeks where he only drives in high traffic areas, where we won&#x27;t get an opportunity to get him up to a speed that ensures a high chance of fatality. The longer we follow him, the more chance we&#x27;ll be spotted, or that he&#x27;ll take his car in for service and someone will find our remote control rig.<p>Our chances are better if we know some place he regularly drives where conditions are better for an accident. Let&#x27;s assume that is what actually happened--they were waiting for him at the place the &quot;accident&quot; actually happened, and consider how risky that was.<p>Accelerating up to high speed and nailing a tree seems pretty straightforward. However, it&#x27;s not as easy is it seems. If you check the photos of the crash scene, on some it looks like the trees are tightly packed, so it would be easy to nail one. However, those photos are looking down the street and mae the trees look more densly packed then they actually are. Find a photo looking from the side, and you can see the trees are much farther apart.<p>If there is any noticeable lag in the remote control, it will actually be pretty hard to aim at a particular tree. Best you&#x27;ll be able to do is veer toward the trees, and hope that when the car crosses the curb that doesn&#x27;t turn it enough to send it between the trees.<p>Even if you do hit a tree, it will be hard to ensure it is a good solid fatal hit, as opposed to some kind of off center hit that doesn&#x27;t stop the car but just sends it spinning.<p>But suppose we get lucky, and actually get a good fatal hit. We&#x27;ve arranged the accident in a place where it will be immediately noticied. We&#x27;ll have civilians on the scene quickly--before the fire has died down enough to let us get in and make sure any evidence that we want destroyed was actually destroyed. Police and fire and ambulance services will arrive quickly.<p>This is a Wile E. Coyote plan.<p>In general, the more steps a plan has that must succeed for the plan to succeed, the lower the reliability of the plan.<p>Shooting him at an anonymous meeting has two steps that must succeed. (1) Call him from a burner phone with a fake anonymous whistleblower story and arrange a meeting. (2) Shoot him when he shows up for the meeting. This either works, or it fails at step 1 leaving nothing behind to tie it to us and nothing to raise suspicion.",1371944579

The point is not &quot;Reagan was wrong&quot;, but rather a more descriptive one: Reagan pushed the boundaries of executive power. Maybe that&#x27;s good, maybe it isn&#x27;t. But as a descriptive matter, Reagan is an important link in the modern chain of presidents broadening executive power on national-security grounds.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is particularly controversial even among conservative historians. The debate is over whether Reagan&#x27;s general tendency towards a strong-executive, law-and-order-via-military-if-necessary position (shared with folks like Edwin Meese) <i>was justified</i>, not over whether it was the case. Even going back to his pre-presidency days, for example, conservative historians typically argue that Reagan&#x27;s declaration of martial law in Berkeley in 1969, in which he sent in the national guard to put down a series of protests, was necessary to maintain order and prevent subversive elements from gaining a foothold. Nobody actually argues that he didn&#x27;t do so, or that it was some kind of situation where he was tricked into it.

Using CSS background-images to represent content is semantically gross.<p>If you wanted to the same advantages with SVG, you shouldn&#x27;t be using CSS sprites; you should take advantage of the fact that SVG is a text-based format and concatenate them all together.  Then, you can use some really simple JavaScript to insert each child SVG into the correct place in the DOM.<p>The ideal way to handle this would look like this:<p><pre><code>    <img src = &quot;icons.svg#map&quot; />\n</code></pre>\nwhere map.svg was the original file on the developer&#x27;s machine.  A grunt task could concatenate all the SVGs in a particular folder together and give them IDs according to their file names.  In the client&#x27;s browser, a JS prollyfill would iterate over all the img tags where src ends in a hash and replaces them with the child SVG of that ID.<p>Just as the prevalence of $$ inspired querySelectorAll, an SVG-optimized spriting system could inspire browser vendors to properly handle hashes in src attributes. and the need for the prollyfill (or the ugliness of CSS spriting) would fade over time.",1371942415
