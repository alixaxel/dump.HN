5814344,comment,5811564,5813343,2,0,robomartin,,,"The only way a services can be non-intrusive is if you, the user, pay for it.  If you paid for the full cost of developing and supporting a solution that did not require such things as advertising and social graph mining in order to build, grow and support a company you'd get a much better product.  You'd probably get a product that is far more sensitive to the needs and wants of it's paying client user-base.<p>That's one of the problems with this culture of everything being free on the 'net.  Free isn't really free.  Businesses don't run on air.  They run on money.  The user always pays.  If it isn't in real currency it will be in ways the company can convert into currency.  That's just the way it is.<p>Aspects of your post bother me to some extent because you are complaining about services you are not paying for.  I think that is a very important distinction.  Don't get me wrong, I have lots of problems with some of the services you mention in your post.  I simply choose not to use them.<p>I also happen to think that people who use ad blockers are just short of thieves.  It's hypocritical to navigate to a site and make use of its free services and, at the same time, go out of your way to deny them revenue.  It's like someone figuring out a way to make you work and legally not pay you for it.",1370278755

5814312,comment,5812807,5813290,2,0,rbehrends,,,"A major difference is tiering in secondary education in Europe. There's not just a single ""high school"" degree, but there are vocational degrees (which you usually finish after 9th or 10th grade, after which you continue at vocational schools) and academic degrees (which you usually finish after 12th or 13th grade).<p>The academic degrees, since they only have to target a subset of students, can then be considerably more demanding than a more generally accessible high school degree (e.g., Calculus being a mandatory subject in some countries rather than the equivalent of an AP course) and you will cover a lot in school what in the US you'd do in the first and second year of college. For the same reason, Bachelor degrees in Europe are typically three year rather than four year affairs.<p>However, that is only part of the story, and a full undergraduate degree in the US (at a good university) will offer you a broader education than what you get out of most undergraduate degrees in Europe; if you want a broader education than what European universities offer, many European countries will point you to affordable continuing education. For example, if you want to learn another language in Germany, many Volkshochschulen offer courses for 2-3 Euro per hour of instruction (more if you need it to be credentialed).<p>Or, more simply put, while you can learn the same things in either the US or Europe, the educational content is packaged in somewhat different structures. And it isn't that one is better or worse than the other; the differences exist more as a result of historical accident or because of how education interacts with the rests of society's institutions and structures.",1370278422

On the one side you have architecture licensees like Apple and Samsung who are building their own ""super A9"" type cores, on the other you've got customers who want to compete with those guys who can't afford to design their own chips.

Clearly it could be a huge drain on ARM resources if they are designing what are ultimately low volume CPUs (between Samsung and Apple they make up perhaps the largest chunk of A9+ shipments) everyone else is behind waiting on ARM and their 'standard' SOC vendors.<p>Makes it really challenging to analyze and/or strategize in the ARM market.",1370278421

I have a fair amount of documentation, so when I everything is finished that I personally have to do, bringing in others won't be an issue then as it would be now.<p>I beg to differ about your claim that delaying its release by a few months is a recipe for disaster.  If you saw what I had written prior to the rewrite... <i>that</i> was a recipe for disaster.  First impressions are huge.  And this project isn't your typical easy come, easy go type of startup.  There's a lot to it, and if one piece of the puzzle is missing, it stands no chance in the real world, so it has to be done right from the very beginning.  I do have a list of things that would be okay to do after its initial release, of course.<p>I have plenty of runway time, so the reality of it is that releasing it months ago instead of months from now would not have been beneficial at all.  If anything, I'd have gotten discouraged because of complaints of massive amounts of bugs and complaints about lack of features/functionality, and I'd have ended up rushing to write code and it would be ugly.  But since I have plenty of runway to spare, I can do it right and release everything (mostly) as advertised, save a few gray hairs, and maybe even have better timing on its release.  Timing is everything.  And if you asked me a year ago, I would have said the world is not yet ready for Loggur.<p>I'm noticing a trend on HN that quite a few people seem to think there's one path to take for a successful startup.  Repeating the ""release early, release often"" mantra is evidence of this fact.  Yes, that mindset might work for the majority of startups, but certainly not all of them.",1370278407

5814195,comment,5813776,5813776,35,0,mpyne,,,"This is why I've started to dislike revisionist history. The premise that the threat of Stalin alone forced Japanese surrender is at least as ludicrous as saying that the nuclear bombs alone forced Japan to surrender.<p>I closed the page immediately because of the full-page popup ad, but I've encountered the premise elsewhere so it warrants examination.<p>The first thing to realize is that for Japan, whatever else happened an invasion of any sort would be harshly contested. It's not simply a matter of manpower either, there was a lot that was needed to be able to provide a workable invasion:<p>* Control of the air.<p>* Gunfire/artillery support to suppress the defenders prior to the assault wave.<p>* Logistical support, including landing craft (LOTS of landing craft), means of turning a beachhead into a supply terminal.<p>* More importantly for logistical support, a working supply chain to feed materiel to the battleground.<p>In almost all military aspects the U.S. was already in much better shape to host an assault on Japan. Even assuming the U.S.S.R. could pull all their troops from the occupation of Eastern Europe fast enough via the Trans-Siberian railroad they still would have needed to accumulate sufficient landing craft, field Naval support assets, build more airstrips and air bases, etc. etc. etc. As a side note, the whole reason Stalin would have needed to move the masses of troops <i>back</i> to the east was because he knew from his diplomats in Japan that Japan would respect the ceasefire that had been signed after Gen. Zhukov decisively defeated the Kwantung Army at the Battle of Khalkhin Gol in 1939, a military result that may have proven invaluable in the later defense of Moscow.<p>The Soviet troops fighting in Manchuria/Manchukuo in 1945 were in a <i>much</i> better military situation by comparison: The Kwantung Army's best troops had been continually bled to fight on the real front lines, Mao and Kai-Shek's guerrilla armies represented a constant drain on the Kwantung Army, and years of garrison duty had the effect of further reducing the martial ability of the KA compared to battle-hardened Soviet troops arriving from the Eastern Front.<p>But at this time the Soviet gains were achieved only overland. In fact the Soviets proved unable due to logistical difficulties to completely overrun Korea, a failure which would itself significantly alter the course of later history.<p>Sometimes proponents of the ""Soviet shock"" theory mention that it was the threat of attack on the Japanese Home Island from the undefended north which truly drove the spectre of fear amongst the Japanese leadership, but that's missing a very big point: There's a <i>reason</i> the Japanese defenders on the Home Islands were concentrating on the south! The Japanese could certainly have redeployed to the north if they had wished, so it seems that they feared the imminent U.S. invasion more than the potential threat of Soviet invasion.<p>But the Japanese <i>knew</i> the Soviets were going to attack. They in fact had been re-deploying the Kwantung Army to east Manchuria where they expected the attack to fall. The Soviets surprised the Japanese by attacking from every possible direction instead, but the surprise wasn't that the Soviets attacked at all, it was that it came sooner than expected and from the wrong directions.<p>None of this is to say that the atom bombs were <i>the</i> reason that the Japanese surrendered either. But it bears repeating that the Japanese were quite willing to fight an invasion of the Home Islands. Whether the invaders were American or Soviet was relatively immaterial, and given the massive American advantage in both air cover and Naval support the Americans could have invaded into a weak spot if that were the only concern.<p>In the actual event the news of the Nagasaki bombing had come during a Supreme Council being hosted by Emperor Hirohito amongst his closest advisers. The news drove the Council to split evenly on whether to surrender (but maintain the Kokutai) or surrender with further conditions.<p>An American B-29 pilot was tortured into ""confessing"" that the U.S. had a 100 more atom bombs, which would be used in the next few days, news which was used by Japan's War Minister to push for surrender. Likewise, when Emperor Hirohito broke his Council's tie (in favor of surrender) he explicitly mentioned the destructiveness of the atom bomb. One of the emperor's advisers even mentioned the 'twin shocks' of Soviet invasion and the atom bombs as being gifts in a sense, as it meant the Emperor could say he was forced to surrender and not that Japan ""gave up"".<p>So it seems clear that the Soviet invasion was core to the decision-making, but not that it was the only concern, and certainly not that the atom bomb was not factored in at all.",1370277318

There are two ways to manipulate it: by low-level node fiddling at a level far below that of the discrete UI elements being represented, or by deleting subtrees and replacing them from a serialized source (html), losing event handlers and embedded state in the process. Neither solution is usable when dealing with complex ui elements that have no corresponding html tag, so you end up needing an abstraction layer that implements of these mechanisms and does the boilerplate work to make it practical. Because of this abstraction layer things always get complicated as soon as you try to move beyond basic html tags with onclick handlers beause you end up learning the pseudo-dsl of the abstraction layer.<p>The long term solution is to make html itself extensible so you can define additional tags at the start of the page, with all the related logic, and then can go back to straight dom manipulation without needing any abstraction framework.

It's hard to sell something when you don't know what it is or what it does.<p>2.) Ask a ton of questions. Ask your prospects what their needs are, ask current clients what they like and dislike about your competitors, ask other BD/salespeople in your org to bcc you on their emails so you understand how they're selling, etc.<p>3.) Read and research a lot. Read books about entrepreneurs or companies you admire, read advice from other salespeople on Quora, research your competition, visit your prospects' websites to glean info about them before a call, etc.<p>4.) Understand how your product or service can be genuinely helpful to each customer and get good at being able to concisely explain this to the customer.<p>5.) Be patient. You will have days where it feels like everyone says ""no,"" days where the product team pushes a release back and screws up a big sale, days when no one can make up their mind on your product, etc. Be patient and keep moving forward.",1370276858

Get here and get your mind exploded, then.

Privilege may have gotten <i>some</i> of them in, but it sure as hell is not the norm.<p>As for your final claims: You wish to imply that leaders in various fields got there solely by leveraging connections. I am pointing out that leveraging connections is by no means disproportionally represented. Leveraging connections is an incredibly useful skill, and of course it has its place. What I am pointing out is that for most undergraduates who ever got here, connections didn't exactly play a big role. Yes, the people here probably have a lot more grit, determination, and ""something extra"" that most of you don't. Some of us are here thanks to family connections, sure. Now go find out just how many students Yale (for example) has graduated in its entire history, and compare that with the number of legacy admits. Or compare that with the number of admits for whom a plausible case of ""connections"" may be argued. I can assure you that it won't be a pretty picture for your case.<p>I'll reiterate what I've said before. Most of you are using popular misconceptions to make straw-man arguments. Most of us here are not from ""connected"" families, and most of us are here not because of some mythical privilege. The sort of logic you people are using would make the mere fact that you can go to the corner store and buy a pack of bread a ""privilege."" Privilege is relative.

5814087,comment,5812807,5813352,20,0,astine,,,"""We are pumping out liberal arts grads ""<p>You mean <i>humanities</i> graduates. The Liberal Arts is not about making better managers, that's what an MBA is for, the liberal arts is about exposing students to a wider variety of fields. We have way too many people majoring in fields like history or literature, without corresponding educations in math and science for them to be truly ""liberally educated.""<p>The point of education is only partly to prepare individuals for a specific career. (Technically, that's not even education, but rather ""career training."") The other part is to give them the intellectual tools they need to be parts of society, not just as good worker drones, but as citizens and fully formed individuals. This is something the liberal arts does attempt to address, while specialized training does not. Having a strong knowledge of history really helps when it comes to voting, for example.<p>Even from a career preparation standpoint, however, there is a point to liberal, or at least multidisciplinary, education. That is having an understanding of multiple fields makes it much simpler for one to understand how one field affects another. Just about anyone with a CS degree can write software to a spec but someone with knowledge about both CS and accounting might actually understand the spec when it comes to accounting software and anticipate the needs of clients.<p>All that said, one really needs to differentiate between the liberal arts and the humanities. The humanities are set of disciplines such as history, philosophy, art, etc. which alone, have limited practical use but have a long tradition of being studied in western society. The liberal arts is an approach to education that seeks broad exposure, including the humanities but also including disciplines such as math and science. This term dates back to the reign of Charlemagne, FWIW.",1370276269

5813994,comment,5813542,5813838,14,0,bengotow,,,"Hey folks! Developer of the Spark Inspector here. I've been playing around with Reveal all morning. I think the biggest difference between SI and Reveal is that SI links into your app more extensively. You don't have to click 'Refresh' to make it fetch changes because it swizzles itself into UIKit and NSNotificationCenter. Though method swizzling is somewhat of a dark art, it doesn't really have adverse side-effects if it's done right. I'm curious to know why Reveal takes such a minimally invasive strategy. In my opinion, choosing not to method swizzle will dramatically limit what Reveal can do beyond view hierarchy exploration and maybe logging. There are a lot of other tabs I'd like to add to the Spark Inspector to take it beyond view introspection, and they'll require deep linking into your app!<p>The Spark Inspector also tries to mirror IB more closely (the sidebar panels have a more familiar feel.) It also allows you to see system views within your view hierarchy, which Reveal might be choosing to hide.<p>Also, it seems that a lot of the items in the Reveal sidebar are read-only? (Maybe that's just a beta thing…) I do like that it has an ""Application"" tab in the sidebar for seeing UIApplication properties.<p>At any rate - I welcome some competition, and it's great to see more tools being created for iOS developers! I'm planning to take the Spark Inspector beyond view introspection and NSNotificationCenter monitoring, and it'll be interesting to see where Reveal goes (and how much it'll cost!)",1370275263
