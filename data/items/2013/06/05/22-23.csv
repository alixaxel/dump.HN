An innocuous imageboard where someone posts child pornography, but the moderators quickly remove it.<p>2. A dedicate child pornography forum where people gain access to ""higher levels"" by posting more child pornography.<p>3. A peer-to-peer network, where by connecting to the network a person contributes to its operation, and where some child pornography can be found (but plenty of other files as well).<p>I do not think we would want to see people prosecuted for downloading child pornography in the first case (maybe for uploading it); that would allow anyone to poison any forum they want.  On the other hand, we clearly do want to prosecute people for the second scenario, as it pretty clearly encourages more child pornography to be produced.<p>What about the last one?  On the one hand, there <i>is</i> an exchange occurring -- by connecting to the network, someone is providing increased bandwidth and potentially increases the anonymity of the system, both of which likely benefit a child pornography producer.  On the other hand, if we prosecute people for that, we would effectively outlaw many of the protocols in use on the Internet right now, and make criminals out of the millions of users/operators of those systems.<p>Personally, I would make a requirement that the defendant's actions <i>directly</i> encourage the production of child pornography, and that the defendant <i>knowingly</i> undertook those actions for the purpose of obtaining child pornography.

In most security work your objective isn't too win, it's not to loose.<p>This video[0] is a perfect example. It's was taken during some parade in Northern Ireland. The rioters are trying to break through police lines and, well, generally riot. Observe how the police at the top of the screen at 0:25 looses his temper and tries to go after the person in the blue hoodie. This would be an example of trying to win. He's hitting you, you want to hit him back. The problem is that you are quickly going to loose control over the situation. Worst case scenario individual officers find themselves surrounded, the line is broken, everything turns pear-shaped. This would be loosing. In this case the officer behind him quickly pulls him back in the line and talks him down. In the short term you haven't won, but more importantly you haven't lost.<p>Also look at the crowds reaction at 0:30 as they become even more aggressive. It's boring to fight someone who doesn't fight back. As a bonus, also look at 1:10 how the rioters form a ""human chain"" to not get grabbed by the police. Each person is holding the one in front of him to be able to pull him back.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqfB3jlih50"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqfB3jlih50</a>",1370471746

Instant messaging can have limited scope in other scenarios (let's say you chatting with some support representative for some service). It can be generic as well. Here we are discussing generic instant messaging. Therefore it's proper to compare it to generic e-mail. When it's artificially limited by the service walls, it's unacceptable.<p><i>such services haven't exactly failed in the market.</i><p>Indeed, services like AIM, Skype, Whatsapp and etc. have many users, and are presented as generic instant messaging services, yet they don't allow their users to communicate with others. It's somewhat surprising to me, that people are ready to accept that fact. For some reason they'd see cutting their e-mail off from other servers as unacceptable, but the fact that they are confined within the network of proprietary IM clients doesn't bother them, even though because of that they need to use many clients or protocols to communicate with different networks having an account on each.",1370471187

I also think your working hypothesis is that the only use of a matrix inverse is to solve a linear system of equations. Under this hypothesis it does make sense that there is no utility to computing inverses. However, this hypothesis is incorrect. There are tons of cases where you would want to get at the entries of an inverse, but has nothing to do with solving equations.<p>Here area few examples: consider data generated from a multivariate Gaussians. Now you want to know which components are independent of each other. This is given by whether the inverse of the correlation matrix is zero or not. Another example, say you  want to minimize a function defined over matrices, but want to minimize it only over the set of positive semi-definite matrices. One way of doing these is to use a barrier function: a function that blows up astronomically when you approach the boundary of your constraint set. For positive definite matrices such a barrier function is the logarithm of the determinant. I could go on...",1370470135
