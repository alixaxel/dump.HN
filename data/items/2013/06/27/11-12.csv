If the latter what are some options. At 48 (assuming you are a developer) what is your experience like finding employers who will pay you ,more for your experience and skill rather than knowing a specific technology ? is it harder to find people who appreciate &#x27;refined wisdom&#x27; or is very easy. if the latter how do you go about finding those jobs - is it a volume business - you keep applying constantly and only move when the fit is absolutely right ?",1372334387

Particularly since it seemed like the FBI could get the data that they wanted without having to deal with people like Thordarson (this citing the seizure of the contents of Snorrason&#x27;s Gmail account).<p>But I have to say, Thordarson sending those short emails consisting of semi-trite messages to an FBI agent wererather amusing.\n&quot;ok doki&quot;\n&quot;Merry Christmas :-)&quot;\n&quot;Happy New Year:-)&quot;\nSeems rather unserious and informal on Thordarson&#x27;s part.

5951828,comment,5948804,5949410,1,0,rmc,,,"<i>there are simply far more exceptions to free speech, privacy, etc</i><p>Actually, in many ways I&#x27;d say that the EU has better privacy rights than the US. The Data Protection Directive covers a lot more privacy stuff than is covered by US law.<p>You&#x27;re right about &quot;free speech&quot;, more things are legal to say in the USA than in EU countries, however that&#x27;s (I think) at the expense of other human rights. If you give more free speech rights, you take away other rights (e.g. the free speech rights of the Westboro Baptist church to picket funerals takes away the right to privacy and happiness for the family who are burying a family member. The free speech rights to say &quot;$PERSON has erectile disfunction&quot; takes away the right to privacy of $PERSON, etc.). It all depends on how much you value some things. (How much do you value privacy, how much do you value free speech, how much do you value right to life of marginalized groups etc)<p><i>(I&#x27;m using EU because I&#x27;m more familiar with it)</i>",1372334318

5951826,comment,5951536,5951663,1,0,roderick3427,,,"I think it&#x27;s a matter of comfort. Some people can live life flying by the seat of their pants. In my opinion, those types of people are comfortable with moving fast, breaking and fixing things, and trying new adventures. They can look back at their lives and tell their grand kids how they&#x27;d lived to the fullest. But, on the other side of the spectrum. We have people who feel comfortable living very conservative lives way beneath their means. I think it provides them a sense of security and empowerment. They may come from backgrounds where they never had much growing up that could&#x27;ve contributed to that behavior, maybe. I&#x27;m sure my denfintion of a wholeheartedly lived life would be different from yours and a lot of other people. I don&#x27;t necessary think your definition or anyone else is wrong. I just know at the end of the day we come from different backgrounds. Our desires from life have been shaped by different lives lived in different times or places. If it&#x27;s comfortable for you to do and you&#x27;re still happy about life afterwards with no regrets, I see no problem calling it &quot;living life to fullest&quot;.",1372334305

5951823,comment,5951589,5951589,3,0,oleganza,,,"99% of the time we all successfully exercise disobedience in our personal life. We meet with people we like and then do not meet when we don&#x27;t like them. It includes relatives, friends, coworkers, small shops, big shops etc. 99% of the time you <i>voluntarily</i> decide when to devote your time, money and attention to someone and when to stop doing it. 99% of your life is a wonderful peaceful anarchy.<p>Now there is state. You cannot decide not to provide funds to the state when it behaves the way you dislike. Even if you hide your taxes, the state controls all your currency and prints it for itself without asking you. You cannot simply choose another currency. You can move out — to another state just like yours or worse. You are only allowed to make a humble limited input every 4 years in a form of choosing who will tax you.<p>There is nothing strange or bad in disobedience. You do it everyday in your life.

5951708,comment,5951643,5951643,2,0,cyphax,,,"I have asked myself that question over the last few years and I have come to the conclusion that I really want these frameworks. In the case of jQuery, for example: you can program everything in Javascript without using jQuery. On the other hand, jQuery is not just a lot of code, it&#x27;s tested code. It&#x27;s not much fun having to add browser/engine-specific code to everything you do. Thankfully, the need for this specifically seems to be slowly fading away now that all browsers are to a certain extend on the same level.<p>In the case of such frameworks like Backbone/ember/Angular: these are implementations of MVC or MVVM or other such patterns, in Javascript. These make it easy to share data between web services you create, and, in the case of e.g. Knockout, bind data to controls on your page. You save yourself from having to write AND test all these things yourself. I have tried, for the first time, Backbone mere days ago, to see what the added benefit is. It gave me what&#x27;s required to send data (in JSON format) to, for example, my controller, but what&#x27;s nice about it is, for example, model binding.<p>It might not be entirely unlike PHP&#x27;s situation: you can program your projects in plain PHP, or you can use the Zend Framework or Symphony or whatever you prefer, which adds a lot of (tested) logic that you otherwise would have to program yourself.<p>Do you NEED it? Not using these won&#x27;t limit you, but you&#x27;ll probably find yourself programming these things out yourself in a lot of cases, where many smart people have done this already.",1372332334

To be convinced that these changes work well and don&#x27;t break any other working behavior, I first push the new version to a another server (&quot;staging server&quot;), which basically is a clone of the production server.<p>On the staging server, I observe if everything works well by going through some use case scenarios <i>manually</i>. Once I&#x27;m convinced that everything works well, I deploy the new version to the production server for my beta testers to try out and give feedback.<p>So cycles of &quot;new versions on production&quot; can currently take anything between a few minutes (really quick bugfix, &quot;OMG the website is not working at all!&quot;) and a few days (new feature)<p>One could complain that there should be a test suite running unit tests and integration tests, taking care of making sure everything works well. But I have two observations that make it impossible for me to rely on a big automatic test suite:<p>* as my website is still technically in an explorative mode, constructing test cases is wasteful: my website&#x27;s architecture changes quickly to adapt to new insights. I rather spend my resources on developing features than on a test suite that doesn&#x27;t work with the new architecture.\n* Subtle differences on my production server (limited server resources, different HTTP request behavior) make it impossible to rely on a simulated environment for my integration tests. Therefore, I have a staging server with the exact configuration as my production server. The only difference are IP address and domain name. These differences shouldn&#x27;t break anything in my website, but you never know until it breaks the first time :)",1372332124

If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.\nHiro used to feel this way, too, but then he ran into Raven. In a way, this was liberating. He no longer has to worry about being the baddest motherfucker in the world. The position is taken.",1372330985

There were outbreaks of disorder and in one case student demonstrators attacked a car carrying Prince Charles and his wife Camilla.&quot; [1]<p>I might just be being cynical but this sounds like an intelligence led operation to remove people who were at a high risk of commiting public disorder. It seems pretty limited that it was 20 people and they were picked up all across london - the police didn&#x27;t just swoop in on a group of protesters with anti-monarchy banners, they were specifically targeted. I appreciate although the UK has no &quot;constitution&quot; we have to free protest but from the riots last year I think The Met have every right to be cautious about preventing demonstrations which could spark into something dangerous at one of the biggest public spectacles of the decade, when the entire crowd is made up of families trying to enjoy themselves.<p>If the cause is so noble, one shouldn&#x27;t need to use a large public spectacle as a vehicle for it.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/may/27/activists-arrested-c/hallenge-police-high-court"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/may/27/activists-arrested-...</a>",1372330894
