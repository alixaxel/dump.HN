Rather than looking at how to interject ads into social media, or to otherwise hijack a fraction of the collective attention span of your userbase that you can then sell to the highest bidder, instead look at how to leverage social functionality to put tools into people&#x27;s hands to help them help themselves in the service of commerce. For example, google search ads and pinterest.<p>Other examples: enable finding product and restaurant reviews, ratings, and suggestions by friends; improve wishlists for gift-buying; make group purchasing at discount easier for many products (games, books, movies, concerts, events, etc.); enable time sharing of services; facilitate picking up hobbies, skills, and activities; and so forth. There&#x27;s tons of money in these ideas, but it&#x27;s more common for companies to go to the advertising trough because it&#x27;s seemingly so easy.<p>In my view it&#x27;s always easier to make money off of a transaction that both sides obviously benefit from.",1370940267
