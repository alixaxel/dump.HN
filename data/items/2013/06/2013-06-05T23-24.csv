5829506,comment,5829160,5829444,9,0,sanderjd,,,"> The sentence you quoted actually is itself an anecdote<p>No, it is a conclusion drawn from an implied accumulation of anecdote. An actual anecdote would be something like, ""when my brother on the other side of the country had a baby, I found out on Facebook, and was thus more connected to him."" Ie. it would demonstrate connectedness to someone far away who is cared about deeply.<p>I think the original author and the poster you replied to probably have very different definitions of ""deeply"". Facebook doesn't seem very useful for first tier people who get the phone/snail mail/IM/email treatment or third tier people who you don't care to keep up with much, but it has a sweet spot in that second tier. It's usefulness to individual people is probably proportional to how large their second tier is.",1370476764

While you can glean that we have a Presbyterian form of government and purport to be evangelical in nature, to be honest, you cannot read too much into a name - a group of Christians are best understood by their fruits.<p>I've always struggled to reconcile how someone could suggest they're Christian but only choose to believe certain parts of the bible and dismiss the rest as just stories (note, I'm not referring to how specific parts of the bible are illustrative in nature). For me, the whole thing crumbles away if you dismiss parts of it.<p>I've heard people suggest that it's more important to take away the good things and good examples than to actually believe in the stories as facts.<p>Anyway, that's just a slice of my opinion.<p>I'm interested in your statement that evangelicals are communitarian and fundamentalists are separatists, I see this practically in some church communities - but I see the opposite in others.

You will likely price out most of other devs, however.<p>- I like the retroactive analysis. The idea of grab everything and let god sort it out speaks to me.<p>- I like doing both device and web analytics in one place. I don't think doing one or the other makes sense anymore.<p>Cons:<p>- I don't see a way to make sure a user from different devices is counted as one user, not two. I want to track the user across all touch points. From experience I know solving this problem is very-very hard - sometimes you want to see what the user did before he identified himself, which is where your idea of ""one user per session"" falls apart - a session might have different users in it signin in and out, and then there is a period between signins which can be attributed to either of the authenticated users before or after in the same session. Not to mention apps with support for multiple-account apps, (e.g. iOS gmail app where identity depends on which part of the app you're in).<p>With all that said, I don't think I will be trying it out. There are tons of analytics services out there, and I don't feel like I can make an educated decision about which one to try first, or at all. Where you can help me is by providing a survey of the problem space, talking about the problems, potential solution methods, and then addressing which products implement which methods.<p>Good luck.",1370476185

5829445,comment,5824445,5827973,2,0,acomar,,,"Weird is in the eye of the beholder. Let me put it this way, do you understand why matrix multiplication is defined the way it is? That looks weird too if you've never tried to derive it for yourself. That is, it's the lack of intuition and familiarity with the underlying concepts (vector algebra) that make it look weird. Also, the question is about a formula.<p>The determinant is a function from a matrix to a scalar that behaves in a nice way. The motivation for the particular properties chosen for ""nice""-ness are complicated and out of the scope of the author's answer.

In fact, it could actually hurt.<p>Hurt?  That's not physically possible... It sure as hell isn't going to bite my dog.<p>> I used to have a dog with hip problems. As her hip got worse she ran more, not less. Why? Because it took her longer. Sure, it was lower speed, and she galloped weird, but Whistle would still track that as an increase in running! As a converse, as she got better the time duration of her running fell, but her intensity and speed increased. Again, giving you the wrong idea via Whistle data.<p>Where's your data to back this claim up? I kid, I kid, but seriously don't you think these are changes that this device would detect, and if properly programmed point out to the user as abnormal?  Now there's nothing to stop their algorithm from sucking and they could say ""great job on walking your hurt dog for 27 miles this weekend on a camping trip dude. Gold star! (I'm assuming this is what you mean by hurt, not to be bitten)  But, you'd hope that as the device matures they'd discover these sorts of things and look for them.<p>> As I said before, Whistle is the Moves app for Dogs. I suggest you download that app, see the data you get from it, and if you would like that for your dog then go for it. Just remember you're paying $100 for the same functionality provided by a free app.<p>I'm sorry my dog lost his smart phone last week so I'd have to buy him a new one... oh oh oh, I hear I could spend 100 bucks and get this same information in a nice neat little package that clips onto their collar!<p>The point of all this is that this device IS superfluous, I don't need any of this data.  It falls squarely into the WANT category.  Just like the fitbit (don't need that to work out either).  It's a want kinda like say... a galaxy s4 (or iPhone 5), second laptop, extra pairs of shoes, raspberry pi, a new game, a new... you get the picture.  No one is going to put this in the ""You literally have to get one of these or your dog will die"" category.<p>But you can't argue that a collection of data from all 10+ years is something that you ALREADY have .  I say that because I like data.  I like seeing graphs of activity, and being able to digest information in a meaningful manner.  And it's not like you are going to make something that collects said data for cheaper than 100 bucks and create instructions/send it to me...<p>What I will say is that this device is not a substitute for caring for and watching your dog.  Sure it'll give you pretty data, but at the end of the day they need love and attention more than anything else (which I think we can both agree on).",1370475886

If the blind date goes bad and there's no chemistry, your friends act as a hedge against having a bad night. Sure, the girls may not be good, but you've still got your friends so you can go somewhere else afterwards.<p>When we setup drinks, you see who you're going out with, so it isn't blind. You know there's at least some physical attraction, or something about the other person you're interested in. We don't assume for you that it'll work out, both people decide in advance that they want to meet up. Worst case scenario is you meet someone interesting, and maybe you'll stay in touch after that.<p>As for pricing, I still think the service we offer isn't priced high enough. Grouper makes $120 per night out, we make $75 or $150 and it's not blind--they're splitting the cost between your friends. If you're busy, your time is valuable. For every 100 messages you send out on a dating web site, you'll get on average 10 replies. For every 10 replies, you'll on average get 1 date. For every 10 dates, you'll have 1 or 2 good matches. That's a lot of manual time, and I'd say that alone is worth $75 if you're a busy professional.<p>We will never attract professional grade matchmakers at this price point, but we can at least do a lot of the work for you and suggest good matches. If you want to hire an actual matchmaker, you'll be paying in the order of thousands of dollars. Linx Dating, just to use an extreme example, is $30,000 for 11 introductions over 2 years.

The tracking number is also recovered from barcodes on the package, if available.  Then after every piece is entered into the database it's uniquely barcoded for internal tracking.    Nothing is scanned or opened unless customers ask for it.  That's for your privacy as well as liability for the business.  Most of the customers get a big FedEx envelope or pouch full of still stamped and sealed regular envelopes (that goes a long way towards building trust) on a weekly/biweekly/monthly basis.

The article goes on even without providing <i>anecdotal</i> evidence, let alone anything to the extent I was expecting or hoping. In fact, the entire discussion seems to be about the hiding feature. Yeah, everyone knows about it (and more and more people are using it), but I'm not sure how using a destructive feature of a service makes the service <i>more</i> necessary (I would argue for the opposite). If I hide 90% of my ""friends"" from my feed, for example, what's the point of Facebook? Apart from the ego-boosting friend-count (which I might also hide).<p>Now, going back to the initial (bolded!) argument: <i>Facebook keeps me connected to folks I care deeply about who aren’t nearby.</i> I think that this is just simply not true. Of course, a definition of ""care deeply"" would be needed, but my assumption here is that we're talking about moms, dads, sisters, brothers, aunts, BFFs, and the like -- NOT ex-girlfriends/boyfriends or classmates from high school that helped us out that one time on that one biology project in freshman year. If I only contacted my mom or dad through Facebook, my parents would first of all be quite mad -- and second of all, our relationship would suffer. People that I <i>care deeply</i> about get emails, phone calls, Skype calls, text messages, sometimes even snail-mail from me! I'm not sure how the OP expects us to connect Facebook to ""caring deeply."" Again, some evidence (or an actual argument) would've been nice.<p>I don't hate Facebook, but more often than not, I find myself just using it when I'm bored and semi-creeping around seeing what X or Y is up to and randomly clicking on that ""cute girl that's a friend of a friend of a friend"" (incidentally, this is what most people use it for).

5829310,comment,5828772,5829058,2,0,jethroalias97,,,"I have been using Riak's secondary indexes for my latest project and have generally found them a joy to use. However, I do have to have to question a bit the way they are architected.<p>Assuming you are using Riak's default configuration each range query hits 1/3 of the cluster, which could get pretty hairy on large clusters that have lots of requests. Also, there is no pagination, so if an index has a million objects you'll have to be prepared to wait even if you only want the first part of the query.<p>You could solve this by putting a sort value in the key and using a range query, but this wouldn't work if you want the most recent items keyed with time, because the items could be unevenly spaced back in time. Also, Riak, like many databases based on Dynamo, thrives on fat data which one would think would favor lists. LevelDB is also supposedly slower than Bitcask, the default backend, but I'm not sure if this is still true.<p>I've been trying to think of ways around these problems. A simple thought I had was to simply cache the response as pages in Riak. Although this introduces new problems like how to know how often to reset the cache, too often and I may as well not have this cache, too infrequently and users get stale data. I would also have to handle this using worker threads because I wouldn't want the odd 100th user to get a big latency hit. The database would also either have to be continually polled, wasting CPU, or potentially not have the data cached when needed.<p>Another solution I've been considering is to write a secondary index layer on top of Riak using a skiplist or btree to know where to add and remove data when it gets to be very large. This seems like a cool idea, but might be tricky to implement and do conflict resolutions on.<p>My last idea was the most ambitious, which was to implement a separate distributed database specifically for secondary indexes and range queries which would not be bound by Dynamo. The idea here is to have each node in charge of a segment of the key space (like Big Table) and then have it split and coalesce not only based on size, but also on frequency of reads and writes to handle the bottleneck problem.<p>I initially was going to have this paired with the Dynamo database (<a href=""https://github.com/dbunker/Dynago"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dbunker/Dynago</a>) I was experimenting with using Go and LevelDB, but there is no reason it couldn't work with any Key-Value eventually-consistent hyper-reliable database to provide light-weight secondary indexes. Having it constantly check the core key-value database would mean it wouldn't have to be super reliable in its own right and so could be kept relatively simple.<p>But again the simplest solution may ultimately be the way to go, I'm not sure, all these seem to have pretty big trade offs.",1370474214

In moderate to severe cases of depression, the improvement was <i>clinically significant</i> (ie a clinician and patient clearly note the improvement). The meta-analysis done on clinical trials were overwhelmingly trials of 6 weeks of SSRI or less. Suicidal patients are almost all excluded from such trials. Treatment groups were treated with SSRIs via research protocols, and not usual clinical practice: there were no attempts made to match patients to an SSRI that would be most likely to help, to wait on a response, to use SSRIs that were helpful based on a family history; dose adjustments were typically prescribed by study protocol and not by patient response, patients were not switched to another SSRI when there was no response or if intolerable side effects developed, often no attempt to treat side effects with other agents were done, etc. In other words, none of the things any physician routinely does to optimize treatment were done in those trials, and yet there were STILL improvements in measures of depression across the board.<p>No reputable psychiatrist or physician will fail to recommend an SSRI in cases of moderate to severe depression. Therapy can also be helpful, but the evidence is <i>overwhelming</i> that SSRIs help in clinically significant ways in moderate to severe depression. There is no credible doubt about it.<p>Despite your assertions about what ""people very much want to believe"" - in my experience, people very much want to believe that the brain is somehow different - that something beyond biology is at work. Believing that somehow depressed or otherwise mentally ill people can just ""snap out of it"" or ""pull themselves up by their bootstraps"" is erroneous, unhelpful, but fits nicely into really completely shitty and cruel narratives about human beings.<p>But please. Perhaps you'd like to advance a theory on how an organ like the brain differs from every other organ and does its work in ways not explainable by biology, chemistry, physics, etc.",1370474084

It's hard to read a pdf of a book when its resolution makes it hard to fit a single page onto your screen. There is something about continuous scrolling that makes it harder for me to remember the text that I'm reading.<p>So a large screen e-reader (that won't have any backlight issues) could be a great gadget to have. I tried a Kindle DX in 2010, but I found panning around in PDFs to be too slow for enjoyment. If and when the technology improves enough, there could be a big student market for a large screen e-ink reader that can display PDFs (or saner formats, like DJVU).",1370473600
