Adding more, and adding some &quot;unique&quot; security features in the future, but wanted to get something out there now.  Doing &quot;cross border&quot; that way is probably the most meaningful, assuming many countries set up their monitoring on international links.  Being aggregated inside a VPN service helps a lot there.<p>End to end is mostly the right solution, but I&#x27;d like to see message/object based encryption (conf and signing) rather than just transport encryption, too.<p>(other metadata includes DNS resolution, and of course all the other protocols and things which aren&#x27;t encrypted -- it&#x27;s not JUST an issue of hiding your IP)",1371754763

There is a lot of literature on the subject spanning advice about patterns and principles to cookbook recipes for problems and so forth. The challenging part with clean code is that most of it is fairly subjective. More of an art than a science.

Sadly it&#x27;s very difficult to create a market for preservation, especially when the individual impact is just as small.<p>I ask this non-rhetorically: how the hell does anyone turn that on its head, especially without government involvement?<p>The Ocean Research and Conservation Association is a nonprofit that&#x27;s trying to promote the visibility of this problem (hypoxia caused by harmful blooms).  They&#x27;re doing this through the use of very low cost in situ sensor networks [1] and broad spectrum toxicology assays [2]. It&#x27;s headed by Dr. Edie Widder [3], the scientist who got the first footage of the giant squid on last year&#x27;s Discovery Channel cruise.<p>In combination with measuring physical/chemical parameters, they can automatically measure biological parameters of the environment. They&#x27;ve done this by miniaturizing and cost-reducing bathyphotometer [4] technology.<p>To the best of my very limited knowledge <i>nobody</i> else is looking at the problem this way. Everybody else measures physical/chemical parameters, and either infer what&#x27;s happening to the biology, or they do point or small area biological sampling on an infrequent basis. And because it&#x27;s so damn expensive there&#x27;s always a big tradeoff between temporal and spatial resolution. With techniques like that everything is aggregate and there&#x27;s little ability to tie specific action to specific consequences, let alone enforce any kind of feedback loop.<p>One of ORCA&#x27;s biggest goals is to create a realtime water health gradient map that&#x27;s promoted to and accessible by the general public. In a perfect world this would be used on the news right alongside the weather report.<p>I hate to cast a light of negativity but frankly I doubt they&#x27;ll ever pull this off. Not because of lack of technical ability or people with the passion to do the work, but because of lack of stable funding. What&#x27;s crazy is their technology is downright <i>cheap</i>, especially compared to the magnitude of the problem. If they could ever pull together the funding to engineer for manufacturability and do a full volume run, it&#x27;d be orders of magnitude less expensive.<p>I freely admit that I suck at marketing, so the best I can offer is a shameless plea. If this problem is important to you do something to solve it. Read up on nutrient limiting and how it impacts hypoxia. Find a polite way to tell your neighbor that their super green lawn might be sucking the life out of the waterways. Spend a bit more to buy your meat and produce from farms that limit runoff. If you have loose change, donate to organizations like ORCA or perhaps to someone more local to you.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.teamorca.org/cfiles/kilroy_technical.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teamorca.org/cfiles/kilroy_technical.cfm</a>\n2: <a href=""http://www.teamorca.org/cfiles/fast.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teamorca.org/cfiles/fast.cfm</a>\n3: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/speakers/edith_widder.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/speakers/edith_widder.html</a>\n4: <a href=""http://www.teamorca.org/cfiles/biolum_study.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teamorca.org/cfiles/biolum_study.cfm</a><p>Disclosure: I&#x27;m a former ORCA employee, but otherwise I&#x27;m no longer affiliated.<p>Edit:<p>Bathyphotometer link [4] refers to a larger, more expensive model Edie designed for the US Navy.

In a world where autonomy can only be purchased by wealth, any rational actor will spend his/her time optimizing the acquisition of wealth by solving easy problems as quickly as possible. This will then allow him/her the necessary autonomy to tackle hard problems.<p>This applies to all capital intensive endeavors of creation: science, film, software, hardware, etc. Even the least capital intensive endeavors such as pure mathematics require autonomy in the form of a guarantee of food, shelter, and healthcare to be viable in the long term.<p>As such, the solution is simple: Increase autonomy. But do we increase autonomy for everyone, or pick and choose winners?<p>The first strategy is basic income, and the second strategy is venture capital. Those involved in venture capital are now seeing the weaknesses in their own system, wherein picking and choosing winners will skew heavily towards the best signalers (i.e. marketers), rather than the most qualified/talented.<p>If VCs want to hedge their bets, they can put their lobbying money where their mouths are, and support basic income. This allows savants who are unable to market themselves the required freedom to work on their ideas with a tiny but guaranteed degree of autonomy. It is the equivalent of buying a Vangaurd index fund instead of picking and choosing stocks for a portfolio.<p>The winning strategy is to do both simultaneously.",1371754490

I mean, my sink won&#x27;t even hold 20 liters of water.  Even if that water isn&#x27;t usefully warming up your house, we&#x27;re still talking about (45°-20°)×250ml/bottle×1 calorie/ml/° for more like 26 kJ per bottle.<p>As for the steam, you only need enough steam to fill the bottle — perhaps one gram of steam per bottle, or a bit less.  That costs you on the order of 600 calories, or about 2.5 kJ.  Actually heating the bottle itself at 0.84 J/g/° will cost more than that; say that instead of heating to 73°, the minimum standard for food sterilization, you heat it to 150° with high-pressure steam.  That&#x27;s (150°-20°) × 200 g × 0.84 J/g/° = 22 kJ.<p>So, assuming batch autoclaves like you said, with much higher temperatures than needed, with people washing their bottles at home in the sink, we have an energy cost of 26kJ + 2.5 kJ + 22kJ = 50kJ per bottle, compared to the 200kJ you calculated to recycle it.  And that&#x27;s why glass bottle reuse is widespread, even if perhaps not in your neighborhood: it saves energy.  In my neighborhood, it&#x27;s basically universal.  Beer is <i>always</i> bought in returnable bottles here, and soft drink glass bottles are usually returnable.<p>Why might it not be widespread in your neighborhood?  Aside from the water-heating externality you suggest, I suspect that it&#x27;s because you guys are spending extra energy to reduce labor costs, because labor is expensive where you are, especially when doing the labor means you have to deal with dirty, stinky bottles — even if occasionally.<p>On the other hand, basically anything you do with a plastic bottle — whether you return it for reuse or throw it away, both of which are common in my neighborhood — is going to cost a great deal less energy.<p>By the way, I&#x27;m really delighted to have a conversation here on HN that involves actual facts and calculation, along with careful consideration of the possibilities.

5913988,comment,5913135,5913135,11,0,a_p,,,"> We were once great at innovating in the physical world...But recently, software (and mostly Internet software) has been the focus of innovation, and its importance is probably still underestimated—there are compounding effects to how it’s changing the world that we’re only now beginning to see...But innovation in the physical world (besides phones and computers) over the same time period has been less impressive.<p>Actually, I would argue that the <i>opposite</i> is true. Software hasn&#x27;t really had any important innovations (using David Wheeler&#x27;s definition, which is from a CS/EE perspective, and which is linked to every couple of months on HN[1]). The software required to run a smartphone isn&#x27;t significantly different than the software needed to run a similar application on a desktop. On the other hand, the hardware on a smartphone now and a desktop from the 90s is different. We take hardware advances like reliable capacitive touchscreens and maybe this storage advance linked to on HN today [2], and Moore&#x27;s &quot;Law&quot; for granted, but &quot;putting more transistors in a circuit&quot; and increased hardware capabilities were the bottleneck to producing today&#x27;s technology, not new software techniques.<p>The reason that people associate software with innovation is because it has become the latest tech buzzword. When a word is overused in this manner, it is hard to have a conversation about it because the definition has been degraded to include pretty much anything. The granting of patents to trivial software ideas gives companies a claim to innovation that they do not deserve.<p>Rayiner&#x27;s comment on this thread:<p>> The long-hanging fruit is gone, and all that&#x27;s left is hard engineering.<p>will soon be true for computer hardware, and eventually &quot;Moore&#x27;s Law&quot; will be broken. When software does not become significantly faster each release cycle, it will be more apparent that hardware is responsible for today&#x27;s advances as opposed to software.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.dwheeler.com/innovation/innovation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dwheeler.com/innovation/innovation.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5911347"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5911347</a>",1371753658

5913920,comment,5911273,5913206,4,0,graycat,,,"> I sincerely hope that the laws will get struck down, but I also fear that the classified nature of many things that touch this will lead the courts to say that we can&#x27;t show we have standing, and therefore decline to rule on the constitutionality.<p>So, the Supreme Court will let claims of &#x27;secrecy&#x27;\ntrash the Constitution?  I don&#x27;t think so!  The \ncourt should be able to find some ways around\nsuch claims of &#x27;secrecy&#x27;!  Telling those\nnine justices that they can&#x27;t get &#x27;secret&#x27;\ndetails promises not to \n&#x27;play well&#x27;!  The NSA is worried about tracking\nsome loser, wacko, nutjob Jihader from\nSomalia, and the Supreme Court is worried\nabout saving the US Constitution -- hmm ...!<p>> More importantly, what matters is NOT just what the laws say, but whether the government follows them!<p>If the executive branch is violating a law, bring a legal\ncase.  While this answer is simplistic, \nand usually is not an easy path, it is basically\nthe way the process works.  But such a case has\nto be brought and decided only once -- after\nthat any judge can say that the issue has\nalready been decided.\nWhile the process is not always\neasy, in important cases it tends to get followed.  E.g., if\nthe FBI goes to Google and says &quot;gimme&quot;, Google can\nreply &quot;see you in court&quot;.  &quot;Double secret probation&quot; worked\nin the movie &#x27;Animal House&#x27; but won&#x27;t last long before the\nSupreme Court.<p>> What the King Does Is Legal<p>Not really true, but there is a lot of &#x27;latitude&#x27;.  And\nthere can be a &#x27;time window&#x27; until legal cases are brought.\nBut the President is Commander in Chief so can tell\nthe military to take that town.  If the town is in the\nUS, then there is a law about that.  If the town is\nin another country, then the president should have \nsome &#x27;war powers&#x27;, but the way it usually works in\npractice is that the president asks Congress for\nan authorizing vote.  Then of course the president\nneeds Congress to vote the money for the military\naction.  And Congress can also pass a law that\nsays that no money will be used to take the\ntown in question -- in which case for the money\nthe president has to run a bake sale, sell some\narms and call up Colonel North, or some such.  If the vote is 2/3rds in both\nhouses, then it overrides any presidential veto\nand stands.  So far the pushing and shoving\nfrom both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have not\ngone beyond such things.  E.g., in effect for\nGulf War II, Congress voted some &#x27;authorization&#x27;\n(I&#x27;m no expert with details), did vote the money,\nlots of money, often, and didn&#x27;t vote &quot;no\nmoney will be spent in Iraq&quot; or any such thing.\nW didn&#x27;t do Gulf War II by himself and, instead,\nhad a lot of help from Congress; it wasn&#x27;t\nall W&#x27;s fault.  Cheney&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s no doubt that Saddam\nhas WMD.&quot;?  Well, if count chembio weapons, that\nwas true.  Why?  Because we still had the receipts\nfrom when we shipped those materials to him\nwhen he was fighting Iran.  I was 100% against\nGulf War II, but it wasn&#x27;t all W&#x27;s fault;\nhe had a lot of help, enough that at least\nthe spirit of the Constitution was followed.<p>It&#x27;s simple:  Nearly all the power is in\nCongress, if they can get a sufficient\nmajority to use it.  But if Congress goes\nbeyond the Constitution, then they can get\nslapped down by Supreme Court just across\nthe street.  We had some darned smart \nfounding fathers:  They were working to\ngive up a lot of the power of the separate states\nto a central government and were darned\ncareful about doing so.<p>Gitmo is a legal mess:  (1) It&#x27;s not in the US,\ndeliberately so.  (2) It&#x27;s supposedly about\nwhat we are now calling &#x27;prisoners of war&#x27;.\nSomehow a lot of people want to regard the\nprisoners in Gitmo as having the right to\naccess the US legal system, but that&#x27;s\nnot so clear, and, indeed, how the US\nmilitary handles &#x27;justice&#x27; on the in times\nof &#x27;war&#x27;, or whatever we are calling the\nfight against Al Qaeda, etc., has long\nor always been a long way from the US\ndomestic criminal legal system.  E.g., the\nstories go that in Viet Nam, the US had\nfour prisoners and wanted them to talk but\nthey didn&#x27;t want to talk.  So, all four\nprisoners got a helicopter ride.  From\nmaybe 2000 feet up, the prisoners were\nasked one last time to talk.  When they\ndidn&#x27;t, one prisoner went outside for \na &#x27;walk&#x27;, from 2000 feet up.  The story\nis that then usually the other three\nprisoners were willing to talk.  The\nGeneva Convention may have something to\nsay about such tactics, but I don&#x27;t recall\nif the Geneva Convention applied in\nViet Nam.  Maybe Senator McCain\n(whom I rarely agree with -- he\ndidn&#x27;t actually sink a US aircraft\ncarrier although he came close) can\ngive some details on how the Geneva\nConvention applied in Viet Nam.\nI was very much against the US in\nViet Nam soon after I heard General\nMaxwell Taylor speak and asked him\na question and got his answer;\nbut with the US military actually sent\nto Viet Nam, some of the details on\njust how they talked to prisoners I\nwas less concerned about.\nBroadly just what the heck the US\nmilitary does on battlefields is to\nme a bit far from the US Constitution\nhere inside the US.<p>> This time around, the fact that it&#x27;s being done by the NSA with the President&#x27;s permission allows them to claim that the classified nature of nearly everything at stake here means we should trust them.<p>They can claim all kinds of stuff.  E.g., they\nmight claim that no kittens or puppies were\nharmed by the NSA.  Fine.  Irrelevant but\nfine.  Similarly they might claim \n&quot;you can trust us -- we love the US and\nwork hard everyday to protect and defend\nthe US and honor the laws and the Constitution&quot; --\nclose to some things they actually said recently and\nabout as relevant as not harming kittens\nand puppies.  Instead, as we know well, very\nwell, all too well, and as I am fully sure\nthat all nine Supreme Court justices know\nwith brilliant clarity,<p>&quot;The price of liberty is eternal vigilance.&quot;<p>Besides, it&#x27;s not up to General Alexander,\nthe NSA, or President Obama to determine\nwhat is &quot;constitutional&quot;.  And it&#x27;s not\nup to Senator Feinstein, etc. either.\nAs we know well, instead, with a suitable\ncase brought, the issue is up to the\nSupreme Court.<p>> Getting the laws overturned will be a HUGE first step<p>Shouldn&#x27;t be.  That&#x27;s just the way the process is \nsupposed to work.  Congress and the president go\nwith the excitement of the moment but eventually\na case is brought to the Supreme Court and cooler,\nwiser heads prevail.  In the meanwhile a General\nAlexander is able to say maybe that he loves\nAmerica while he tracks mud over the First and\nFourth Amendments.<p>Have some faith:  The Constitution is fairly clear.\nThe Supreme Court is highly respected.  Nearly\neveryone in the US understands that the Federal\nGovernment is not supposed to be listening in on\npillow talk, phone sex, steamy e-mails, or \nfollowing people around, e.g., via cell phone towers, as they meet for their\nromantic engagements, etc.  And the government\nis not supposed to be getting all that data,\nfrom Verizon, Google, Microsoft, or the\nInternet backbone even if the government\ndoes not use it.  E.g., an ordinary phone\nwiretap takes a court order, and grabbing\nall the Internet traffic covers wiretaps,\nliterally, and more.  That no alligator\nclips and reel to reel tape recorders\nneed be used is irrelevant -- grabbing\nvoice over IP is the same as a wiretap;\ngrabbing that data for 330 million US\ncitizens within the US instead of just\nsome one suspected Mafia thug is\nat least 330 million times worse and\nnot better;\nand without a court order, in line with\nat least the Fourth Amendment grabbing all that data is just\nflatly illegal and unconstitutional.<p>Net, for the Supreme Court to strike down\nthe laws that enabled a lot of what\nSnowden showed will be an easy slam\ndunk from a 10 foot stepladder.  Telling\nthe Supreme Court that they can&#x27;t \nstrike down such laws will be \none of the most outrageously funny\njokes ever cracked near DC.  Take\nthat claim and go down the present\nlist of Supreme Court justices\nand guess who will even smile:\nLet&#x27;s see, will Justice Scalia smile?\nHe never smiles!  Justice Ginsberg?\nShe&#x27;s so serious she can laugh and\nsmile and no one believes it&#x27;s genuine.\nJustices Sotomayor and Kagan?  They\nare both busting their gut everyday\nto be sure no one can claim that\nthey, as women, are not up to the\nfull seriousness of the Court.<p>Trust in the founding fathers, the\nSupreme Court, and the Constitution.\nSo far what the NSA did may be roughly\n&#x27;legal&#x27; with current laws;\nthat may not be the case much longer.",1371753120

I know that we are currently capable of landing planes autonomously currently. Plus this would reduce door-to-door time as well since you&#x27;d reduce the need for long security lines. After all, if there&#x27;s no cockpit to hijack what is the use of screening for potential hijackers?<p>Yes, we can take-off, cruise, navigate, avoid collisions and land autonomously (landing requires a certain ILS category which not all airports have, yet) today. I don&#x27;t really think the limitation is software related - it is likely to be regulations and public opinion. &quot;Human error&quot; is more understandable to the average person than &quot;computer error&quot;.<p>There are other concerns, such as safety against tampering/hacking. However, considering how robotic Airbus aircraft already are, I am not sure those concerns are warranted. Boing is somewhat less so, by design, but they are still fly-by-wire with a computer between the pilot and the actual control surfaces.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t think autonomous aircraft would do much for security. After all, all you need to protect the pilots is a  door lock. You still have to protect the inside of a plane and the passengers, however. But they would do wonders for private jets - having a competent pilot immediately available 24/7 without paying additional salaries could be very appealing for some folks.",1371752398

Which is crucial because nobody wants their phone to be a lab prototype.<p>On the other end, most invention happens in academia. You need a lot of flexibility and low expectations of commercialization in order to really try dramatically new things.<p>The magic companies of the last century are the ones who could do both, allowing people to have side projects that don&#x27;t immediately show commercial promise. Bell Labs was a lot like this. So was PARC. And Google to some degree.<p>I think a lot of Silicon Valley startups now have the worst of both worlds. They feel pressure to monetize and sell for millions, so their creativity is limited and they just barely innovate. They&#x27;re not content to play, or work on something just because they like it and find it interesting. We hold up Elon Musk as a great entrepreneur, but he started building rockets because he wanted them to exist, not because he wanted to make money. [1]<p>It takes a different sort of thinking to come up with SpaceX than it does to build Exec or Instacart. A different level of grit and disregard for fortune. It&#x27;s unfortunately rare to find that spirit matched with incredible focus and ability to execute and sell. And even more unlikely that it gets funded. (There&#x27;s a reason Elon started both Tesla and SpaceX with his own cash.)<p>I&#x27;m certainly not saying that one should disregard the economics of running a company. But you don&#x27;t make radical changes in the world when your ideas start from them. [2]<p>Incidentally, I&#x27;ve actually looked into building ramjet aircraft. (Or scramjet, because why wouldn&#x27;t you go supersonic?) It&#x27;s physically possible, [3] but requires a breakthrough in energy storage and composites on the order of the transistor.<p>I&#x27;ve always thought there are two places in the world with huge market failures: developing world healthcare, and future-tech. In many ways, philanthropy such as the Gates Foundation helps mitigate the first, but I&#x27;ve yet to see anything other than war with a technologically-equal enemy push forward the second. Google is showing some promise which is exciting, but we probably shouldn&#x27;t have all of our future hopes wrapped up in a single giant online advertising company.<p>I think we should create a West Coast &quot;Institue for Advanced Study&quot; in the middle of the desert with a few million dollars and a bunch of dreamers who want to get their hands dirty and try ideas that everyone else thinks are crazy. People do amazing things when nobody is looking over their shoulder.<p>[1] In fact, it seems he had to negotiate like hell to wrap a business model around that company, and got incredibly lucky that Shuttle was retired. You could also argue that SpaceX is still innovation but I would argue that the dramatic cost savings and reusability make it count as invention.<p>[2] Maybe unless you&#x27;re a brilliant economist or politician, but how that world works is a mystery to me.<p>[3] Check out the WaveRider project. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveRider"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WaveRider</a>",1371751775

(Something we now have to call AGI because the fad establishment has cooped the term AI for lesser purposes.)<p>I find it slightly intriguing that a gatekeeper into the World of Funding™ is directly observing a disconnect between quick burn fads and long term usefulness.  Will there be new offshoot Long Game funds?  Software-based long-term problems these days don&#x27;t take gargantuan funding, but people need enough to quit their job and live off of while working towards the future.  These Long Game problems are especially pernicious because sometimes your first payoff isn&#x27;t for years down the line.

The only problem stopping Them[1] from funding every person with a plausible but at-first-glance crazy idea[2] is the problem of selecting the right people, not lack of funding in the world.<p>The only way to make those goals happen yourself these days is to first do a fast-fad application, sell it, then use that as your base of funding.

This fosters a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; situation.<p>That isn&#x27;t really how it plays out, but I think that&#x27;s the allure to many of us Americans.  I&#x27;ve spoken with others who who believe that you must work to earn certain things, such as health care.  It is often toted that people who are obese, smoke, do drugs, and participate in other health risks are more likely to be on government aid than those who &quot;earn&quot; it.  They use this fear of being taken advantage of to fuel a desire a knee-jerk reaction to health care.<p>Yet there are valid concerns.  Especially with the migration of such an entrenched system.<p>If the US government is going to take on Health Care that money needs to come from funds already in the budget.  The US government is poised on the edge of failure, the only thing keeping us going is a mass <i>faith</i> in the ability of the government to pay back it&#x27;s loans, and thus receive more.<p>Also this points to a bigger break in the system.  US Agencies (I can&#x27;t speak to foreign agencies) incentivise the spending of your <i>whole</i> budget.  If you don&#x27;t spend it all then obviously you don&#x27;t need it all.  This creates a mad spending rush at the end of the fiscal year and an atmosphere where you have not only the <i>right</i> but the obligation to spend your budget.<p>I think a lot of people are intimidated by the concept of introducing another burden to the US budget when we are already incentivising the wrong thing.<p>I think if we could cut back the budget in other areas, this would make it possible to introduce a true health program.<p>I&#x27;m only touching on a few reasons why this isn&#x27;t being done immediately.  I do think that our defense budget is outlandish and could be put directly towards health care, but that is a huge transition in the work force.  That is soldiers to medicare specialists.  That sort of transition will take time.",1371751649

It lets governments avoid having everyone&#x27;s data stuck in propriety formats and then extorted by software companies for access later.<p>The UK government, for example, has recently mandated a preference for open source: (<a href=""http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240179643/Government-mandates-preference-for-open-source"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240179643/Government-man...</a>)<p>Unfortunately, governments are still getting caught in proprietary solutions. Here in New-Brunswick, Canada for example, the government has just chosen an officially sponsored electronic medical record system for the province.<p>Unfortunately, they picked a proprietary SAAS system which means that if doctors signup, everyone&#x27;s medical records will be uploaded to some private company&#x27;s servers.<p>The company charges $24 000 per doctor upfront plus $400 a month subscription for continued access with a price guarantee for only three years. After all our medical records have been converted to their proprietary format at a huge cost (not included in the $24000), this company will be in a position to charge whatever they want.<p>The government gives incentives to doctors to signup to the proprietary system ($16000) and have given monopolistic exclusivity for at least three years to this system when it comes to connecting to hospital lab results.<p>There is actually a good open source alternative developed in other Canadian provinces. The OSCAR open source EMR is quickly becoming the most popular system in those provinces. Support plans often costs less than $100/month (it would be free if you were a geeky doctor willing to install and support it yourself). Somehow, the vast marketing and sales budgets of proprietary companies compared to the more minimal OSS sales push was able to sway our government into giving a quasi monopoly to a costly proprietary system.",1371751400

5913702,comment,5912035,5913610,3,0,mjb,,,"> It can be tempting to stand on an ivory tower and proclaim theory, but what is the real world cost/benefit?<p>That&#x27;s an important question. The real world costs of fulling understanding the behavior of a system like Redis, amortized over all the users of that system is likely to be very low. That&#x27;s a huge benefit of using well-tested pieces (whether they are Redis, Cassandra or Oracle) as the foundation of systems.<p>The important question to ask is what you are losing. Losing availability in these complex cases is acceptable for the vast majority of applications. You can save a lot of complexity and cost there. Losing safety is much more of a problem, because the effects can be very long lived. Once you have put inconsistent data into your database, you are in a world of hurt for potentially a very long time.<p>I think that it&#x27;s actually cheaper in the long run, even for small systems with small goals, to build on top of safe components. The costs of writing code to deal with the shifting reality of inconsistent data is higher, as are the costs of not writing that code.<p>I don&#x27;t think that proving the safety of protocols, testing those safety properties once implemented, and understanding failure modes is &quot;ivory tower&quot; at all. It&#x27;s just good engineering practice.",1371751365

Why couldn&#x27;t declaring war with the right amount of propaganda lead to a massive spike in productivity and technical advancement?<p>Largely, becaues those acheivements are a result of prioritizing R&D in wartime (devoting more resources to it), and those simulators don&#x27;t give you much incentive to deprioritize R&D outside of war. If you downplayed the direct &quot;war weariness&quot; effect and instead required devoting output to otherwise nonproductive ends (entertainment, consumable consumer goods, etc.) to maintain morale, and had long-term sortages of those produce unhappiness, then you could model that effect better.",1371751245
