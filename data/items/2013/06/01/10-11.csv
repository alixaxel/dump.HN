5803514,comment,5802295,5803356,2,0,tharshan09,,,"> Here's the problem that you have: smaller companies / start-ups in SF - they're probably not going to be able to sponsor you for a visa. So you're somewhat limited in terms of places you can apply to in the first place. What are Google, Facebook, and the like looking for in graduates? Experience, sure, but incredible technical savvy. You're competing against US graduates from great schools: it can be very difficult.<p>Yep your are right and thats what worries me the most. That technical savvy'ness is what someone non-technical person may think of me, but to a SV employer maybe not? I find it hard to rank myself of where I stand at the moment.<p>> Remember that many companies (Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the like) have engineering offices in London. If you're wanting to move to the US you may find it much easier to look for an opportunity in the UK that could in the future allow you to move laterally.<p>Yep agreed. Its not that I have this long standing dreaming of living in SF or working in SV, I just feel that it would be a great opportunity, and a shame to not try. I feel that if I aim high and do not get it, alternatives cant be that bad. I will most def look for an opportunity in the UK before, but I am not keen on working in London because of having to commute everyday.",1370084340

So before asking me to face facts, please check your own view: if you want a risk free environment for your children, then you actually have to create such a bubble. It's the only way. Even if you convinced me, there will always be unvaccinated people possibly endangering your kids. Reality.<p>As long as you ignore the possible risks of vaccination itself, accusing me of manslaughter due to accepting the risk of infection is simply ridiculous. If my child died from vaccination would it be manslaughter by the doctor, or maybe by you, because you told me I should take the risk of vaccination? Google for ""died from vaccination"" and you will find tons of cases. Is dying from vaccination any better than dying from an infection?<p>Asking me to take risks, to lower your risks, is just not ok.<p>If we were talking about someone who is knowingly infected (like Typhoid Mary), then there is a completely different situation. I agree that such people should be forced into quarantine. Relating avoidance of vaccination to manslaughter is like relating not installing cameras to terrorism: BS.",1370082948

And even Kabul in Afghanistan was a very modern town and somewhat of a hippy mecca in the 1960s, with women in miniskirts, alcohol, etc.<p>I've spent a good bit of time in Turkey in the past 15 years.  Modern Turks who don't wish to live under strict Islamic rule are very much on guard, since they know exactly where Erdogan and his type want the country to be (hint: it looks a lot closer to Iran than France).  And while I criticized them for being ""undemocratic"" when I first visited Turkey in 1998, I wasn't the one who was going to have to permanently live under a strict Islamic government if Erdogan succeeded (and he was thwarted the first time).  But comparing Turkey now to Turkey back then, he is succeeding now, little by little.  And once his ""reforms"" are in place, there will be no going back.",1370082812

5803470,comment,5803249,5803442,4,0,claudius,,,"The point is that at the moment, a day has 86400 SI seconds. If you want to keep it that way, i.e. change neither the length of a day nor change the length of a second, you will have to either divide these 86400 SI seconds up into some sensible pieces (60 60 24, e.g.) or have some remainder left (one day of 10 hours and some weird stuff at the end).<p>The problem here is not the one-off second, but the length of the second per-se which would have to change. Unfortunately, the length of the second is so deeply tied into the SI system that I’d rather have a non-metric day than a change in the length of seconds.<p>Timezones are somewhat orthogonal to this, and while there is some advantage to having a global time (‘let’s meet at 17:00, okay?’), local timezones are also somewhat helpful – you can expect shops to open around 8:00 all over the world and wouldn’t expect them to be open at 22:00; similarly, local authorities can change the time (and hence the time when shops open/close, e.g.) without everyone having to reprint their opening times signs (as happens for DST or during WWI/II).",1370082763
