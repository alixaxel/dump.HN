Their living costs are maybe the highest in the US, but not in the world.<p>I live in Stavanger ,Norway and have a salary around 75-80K USD, 40% of it goes to paying taxes. This is slightly above the average salary here for a software developer.<p>My biggest living costs here is my apartment, and my car.\nMy car (Rusty Mercedes C Class) from 1997 costs me around $8000 per year in gas, toll road, insurance, reparations/service. My small apartment, about 600 sqft in size costs today around 350 000 USD, I bought it two years ago for about 290 000 USD. Standard is good, but you have no chance finding anything around this size for less than 300 000 USD, if you're not willing to move hours with car away from Stavanger.\nFood and beer is also a lot more expensive.<p>I may have free health care/insurance and 5 weeks with holiday, and cheap air tickets to London :) \nBut that's about it.\nEvery time I visit the US, I go shopping like a woman who just got her credit card. Clothes, shoes, sports wear & equipment costs only a third of what it costs in Norway.<p>But I'm not complaining, because I'm doing fine here, though I would love to have sunnier and warmer weather. For me it sounds like the extremely high salaries in SF is becoming a bubble. Much like the oil industry here.",1370080587

Redefining the length of a second is <i>not</i> <i>good</i>. Really, no.<p>Then there is the problem that this is not really a sensible metric time – 10 hours, 100 minutes and 100 seconds each? Frankly, that's stupid – ideally, you want the conversion factors to always be the same, ideally 10³. The swatch time mentioned above got this right with 1000 minutes (‘.beats’)/day, if absolutely necessary, you could probably also go with 100 quarter-hours/day and 100 seconds/quarter-hour, with 1 new second = 8.64 old seconds, or 1 old second ~ 0.12 new seconds.<p>The underlying problem here is that time lengths are intrinsically non-metric and there is little to no way to consistently make a year and a day both ‘metric’, simply because nature doesn’t require them to be. The same goes for nearly all other SI units – the equator is 40 Mm, the average height of a human is ~2m, a human weighs 80kg, not 100kg (and really, <i>k</i>g as the base unit?!).<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time</a>",1370079805

From the point of view of a <i>miner</i> -- i.e. of the computational clusters which compete to make the ledger work -- Moore's law has plenty to do with BitCoin. The fact that the production rate is constant means that there's essentially a fixed-size ""pie"" in any given time-frame. The fact that electronics are becoming cheaper and better means that your investment of $X today can be matched by an investment of k $X tomorrow for some k < 1.

5803356,comment,5802295,5803226,5,0,objclxt,,,"> <i>It would be great to talk to someone who has first hand experience with this</i><p>I'll give it a go! A few things you should be aware of to put what you're saying in context.<p>Firstly, the cost of living in SF is <i>incredibly</i> high. Slightly higher than London, if you can believe it (that's not just my opinion - I was chatting to about half a dozen engineers who had been rebased from SF to London yesterday and they all agreed).<p>Secondly, and this is probably the really important point, you need to actually get the visa. As somebody else has pointed out here, generally salaries for those on H1-B's skew a little lower. Also, it can be very difficult as a <i>graduate</i> to find someone willing to give you a H1-B. This isn't to say you shouldn't apply to jobs in SF when you finish uni - definitely do. It's just that the way the current system works, you could have the best job offer in the world and still have a 50:50 chance of not getting a visa in the lottery.<p>Thirdly, as others have pointed out this is a somewhat self selecting poll. I graduated four years ago, I've worked in London all that time, and I'm on a salary comparable to the valley. I got quite lucky, because I was in a niche field when I started, but it's definitely possible.<p>> when I think about a job at google or other SV or SF company, but what do they expect in terms of experience from a graduate?<p>Here's the problem that you have: smaller companies / start-ups in SF - they're probably not going to be able to sponsor you for a visa. So you're somewhat limited in terms of places you can apply to in the first place. What are Google, Facebook, and the like looking for in graduates? Experience, sure, but incredible technical savvy. You're competing against US graduates from great schools: it can be very difficult.<p>Remember that many companies (Google, Facebook, Twitter, and the like) have engineering offices in London. If you're wanting to move to the US you may find it much easier to look for an opportunity in the UK that could in the future allow you to move laterally.<p>Please don't be discouraged by anything I've said - just don't make money the only reason for moving to SF, and you'll probably end up slightly disappointed.",1370078537

With respect to healthcare, the EU countries actually have the enormously inefficient American system beat (often for better quality at lower cost), with respect to pensions, they generally lag behind due to lower fertility rates.<p>Education pays for itself because it is an investment.

5803331,comment,5796730,5802684,1,0,stuartmorgan,,,"XUL was only part of the problem. Camino's goal was to make a browser that was designed for the Mac. Firefox's goal (once running on the Mac was added after the fact) was to make a cross platform browser that ran on the Mac. That's not just about UI toolkits, it drives basic decisions.<p>Firefox doesn't use Keychain because cross-platform trumped integration. Its localization (a different download for every language, instead of one multi-language binary like <i>every</i> Mac app) is ""wrong"" for the same reason. It doesn't integrate with the Me card in Address Book for form fill data for the same reason. It makes you set your accept-language list manually instead of using the identical OS-level list for the same reason. The list, some small and some large, goes on, and it all adds up.<p>It affects UI behaviors too. I don't know if they eventually fixed it, but for a while closing the last window would quit the app, which is against the platform guidelines for a multi-window app, and was widely hated by Mac users. The justification was that it was consistent with Windows Firefox.<p>Those of us who chose to work on Camino in our free time did so because it was the product we wanted to build, and Mac Firefox was clearly never going to be no matter how much effort we might have put into it. You can call it a waste if you like, but I think you'd be hard pressed to find someone who worked on Camino who regrets the time they spent on it, or considers it a waste.<p>As for it being an ""obvious dead end"", until Gecko embedding  was deprecated there was no reason Camino couldn't have continued indefinitely. How is developing software that many people still love and use a dead end? Not everyone in the world views dominating the market as the definition of success.",1370077867
