5968552,comment,5964573,5967804,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,">To have something analogous in C, your &quot;app&quot; would be a large number of shared libraries (dozens), and they would be dynamically loaded and unloaded. They would talk to each other and shared libraries in other processes. There would be garbage collection, lifetime management and possibly reference counting. Calls into them could be asynchronous, as well as calls out. Managing all that would be non-trivial &quot;scaffolding&quot;.<p>It sounds like you could do it a lot more easily by just having separate processes or threads for each activity/service/whatever.<p>>This isn&#x27;t remotely the same thing as swapping out pages as is done by the kernel.<p>It seems to be almost identical to the OS sending SIGTERM and then SIGKILL to the process in question however.<p>>The &quot;native&quot; API it would provide would need to be analogous to libc, glib, X (and extensions like xrandr), gnome, systemd/udev, dbus, sdl, ibus, garbage collection, shm, reference counting etc all combined (in addition to whatever I forgot).<p>Are you assuming the necessity of a one to one mapping between Java API functions and C API functions? I don&#x27;t care about something &quot;analogous&quot; to libc, just give me libc and you don&#x27;t have to do any work. That solves most of what&#x27;s on your list and obviates the need for garbage collection or reference counting.<p>The real trouble is the UI API because there isn&#x27;t anything to lift it from since Android has a totally independent UI from Desktop Linux. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t worth doing -- and even if <i>that</i> isn&#x27;t worth doing, why can&#x27;t I have the rest of it? If I&#x27;m trying to port a Linux daemon into a service then I don&#x27;t much care about a lack of GUI functions but I most certainly could use a full POSIX implementation.",1372651183

Benchmarking should be done, of course, but only as a way to determine <i>where</i> Strassen&#x27;s algorithm begins to dominate.  Note also that that quote supports what I said, at least in the limit:  Strassen&#x27;s algorithm <i>does</i> improve performance more dramatically for large problem sizes (though how much more dramatically is certainly debatable).<p>I am not going to deny that hardware matters, but it is important to know <i>where</i> it matters.  Hardware matters in terms of constant factors.  For sufficiently large problem sizes, hardware might give you a 10x improvement if you use it correctly -- but that is 10x no matter how large the problem size becomes.  An algorithmic improvement will become increasingly beneficial as the problem size increases; that is why we speak of things like &quot;crossing points,&quot; where an asymptotically faster algorithm begins to dominate.  Even very poor use of hardware features (terrible locality of reference, etc.) will eventually be irrelevant for an asymptotically better algorithm; a large number of really good uses of the hardware is still slower than a small number of really bad uses.",1372650920

Because if disabling JavaScript were to become popular, that takes away that capability of web browsers to run applications.  The conversation would go from something like &quot;we can use JavaScript and this application will run for anyone who has a new version of Firefox, Chrome, or IE10/11, or Safari&quot; to &quot;we can deploy our application to the latest browsers, but we will have to first present a screen asking users to enable JavaScript on our site&quot; or something along those lines. It goes from being a ubiquitous cross-platform solution to one that will only run for people who like JavaScript.<p>JavaScript in the browser is by far the best option we have now and in the foreseeable future for easily deploying applications across different types of operating systems and even devices.<p>Its amazing to me how many people don&#x27;t appreciate that goal or really take it into account.",1372650677

You can see in the view-source that there is still &quot;Y! Store&quot; JavaScript running on his pages, and that, for example, the titles of each essay on his site are actually images hosted at yimg.com (e.g. for this essay, <a href=""http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2270_385"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ep.yimg.com/ca/I/paulgraham_2270_385</a>).<p>pg has spoken about how one of Viaweb&#x27;s major features early-on was that it worked around the limitations of browser fonts by auto-generating images (GIFs) with rendered anti-aliased fonts and served those in the browser. Looks like his site continues to do the same thing to this day.<p>If my theory is true, I really hope pg never redesigns it. It serves as a pretty cool historical reference to the company he founded, that made him wealthy in the sale to Yahoo, and that ultimately allowed him to start YC / HN.<p>The left-side navbar is also an image map! (remember those?) My guess: Viaweb generated a single image out of the navbar description and markup for an image map. In those days, browsers didn&#x27;t handle parallel downloading well. A single navigation element with an image map probably loaded faster in browsers than several navigation image buttons.<p>Yes, image maps are out of vogue and text-as-images is unnecessary with modern browsers.
