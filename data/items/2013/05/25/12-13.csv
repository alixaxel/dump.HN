I don't know if you've ever had people urging others to hurt you but it's immensely threatening, very scary.

If they can't sell those houses, they don't build the rest. It's the cheapest way of establishing whether there's a market for the properties they intend to sell, and it's much cheaper than finding out there's no market having built 50 of them.<p>> ""today's code become's tomorrow's legacy code""<p>Worry about it tomorrow. It's a nice problem to have as it means you're still in business. Most businesses started today won't be.<p>Until you've established that your product is going to have customers, the performance is irrelevant.<p>My favourite example is the fake 'Buy now' button. You don't need to build the payment process until you know people want to pay, and you definitely don't need to worry about how quickly it runs.<p>If people want it, they'll pay even if it's slow. If people don't want it, why are you building it? Nobody buys a product just because it's quick (unless performance <i>is</i> the central feature.)",1369483844

Google will store two (2) types of files to your Google Drive and the newly-created files will not count against your storage limits.<p>1. The first type of file will be private, only accessible to you, containing a snapshot of the Google Buzz public and private posts that you authored.<p>2. The second type of file will contain a copy of only your Google Buzz public posts. By default it will be viewable by anyone with the link and may appear in search results and on your [Google Profile] (if you've linked to your Buzz posts). Note, any existing links to your Google Buzz content will redirect users to this file.<p>3. Any comments that you made on other users' posts will only be saved to those users' files and not to yours. Once the change described in this email is final, only that user will be able to change the sharing settings of those files. This means that if you have commented on another author's private post, that author could choose to make that post and its comments public. If you would like to avoid that possibility, [delete] all your Buzz content now.<p>4. The new Google Drive files will only contain comments from users who previously enabled Google Buzz, and the files will not contain comments that were deleted prior to moving the data to your Google Drive.<p>Once the files have been created, they will be treated the same as any other Drive file. They are yours to do with as you please. This includes downloading them, updating who can access them or deleting them.<p>Before these files are created, you can [view the Google Buzz posts that you have authored here]. If you do not want any of your Buzz posts or comments to be saved to Google Drive files, you can immediately [delete] your Google Buzz account and data.",1369483247
