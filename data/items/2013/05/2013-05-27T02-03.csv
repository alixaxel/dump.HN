The trouble is, unlike poker, you don't have an easy way to calculate the odds, and you are surely wrong as a beginner.

There is harm in it. It doesn't seem hugely unreasonable for people to object. Whether Twitter's actions are worthy of legal interference I don't know. And heck, maybe it wasn't even practical for them to keep supporting the protocol. It is on first blush, however, a bit of a dick move.<p>Of course, in practice, they can do it - but they're screwing over a lot of people in the process and it's unclear why they <i>should</i> be allowed to other than that they own it. And ownership doesn't make sense to me as a strong-form legal principle when you're talking about things that affect many people. To quote Lord Denning:<p>'None of you nowadays will remember the trouble we had - when I was called to the Bar - with exemption clauses. They were printed in small print on the back of tickets and order forms and invoices. They were contained in catalogues or timetables. They were held to be binding on any person who took them without objection. No one ever did object. He never read them or knew what was in them. No matter how unreasonable they were, he was bound. All this was done in the name of ""freedom of contract."" But the freedom was all on the side of the big concern which had the use of the printing press. No freedom for the little man who took the ticket or order form or invoice. The big concern said, ""Take it or leave it."" The little man had no option but to take it. The big concern could and did exempt itself from liability in its own interest without regard to the little man. It got away with it time after time. When the courts said to the big concern, ""You must put it in clear words,"" the big concern had no hesitation in doing so. It knew well that the little man would never read the exemption clauses or understand them.'<p>That's kind of why we have laws concerning bargaining power and things like undue influence, and why contracts are - at least in principle - meant to be more or less equally beneficial. I believe you can trace it back to The Wealth of Nations, and probably before - it's not as if Denning had the idea originally. But in terms of illustration of the conclusion of letting people who own a service dictate how it will be used absolutely. The peak of freedom of contract as a guiding legal principle has - at least in all hope - passed.<p>Silly contracts still get written, mind, that's just taken for granted. I have a contract with my phone provider for a two year plan, for instance, but if it ever came to court I very much doubt that would be upheld - it's far more likely that the court would say that while companies can be reasonably expected to make plans two years in the future I, as an individual (and consequently being far less powerful) can't.",1369622215

No effort is made to hide the Git <i>model</i>, and no effort is made to ensure that the Mercurial repository generated from the Git one is idempotent (i.e., a given Git repo will always generate the same Mercurial repo) or can round-trip (i.e., I can trivially craft repos that hg-git can work with just fine, but where pushing to a bare Git repo will result in a different Git repository from the original).  The benefit to this model is that the Git users don't need to do anything different, ever, and no one needs to know that you were using Mercurial, ever.<p>Kiln Harmony does something different: it's designed to let a team use whatever tools they want.  This means that Mercurial users don't have to learn the Git model, Git users don't have to learn the Mercurial model, and generally, everything ""just works"" in that situation.  Doing that requires a lot more processing power than hg-git requires, which is part of why we only offer it as a hosted solution for the moment.  It also works best when your central repository <i>is</i> a Kiln Harmony repository.<p>I obviously think that's a fine trade-off, but if part of the main motivation of SQLAlchemy was GitHub, then Kiln Harmony probably isn't a good solution.",1369622168

5773135,comment,5771801,5771801,2,0,csense,,,"> when you are measuring performance metrics, they can be hell lot misleading<p>This is true regardless.  For example, if your I/O benchmark is basically sequential, and your application's access pattern is basically random, then your benchmark is useless.<p>Ultimately, the only test that matters is whether a particular piece of hardware runs your particular application.  So as a startup, you write your website, put it on a VPS, if it's slow then you get a bigger VPS or switch providers.  The common case is that a VPS is good enough, and once you grow beyond it, that means you're getting enough revenue to afford an upgrade to a bigger VPS or dedicated server out of money coming in.<p>If you <i>can't</i> afford the upgrade when you need it, then it means either you're inadequately capitalized (you don't have enough investment to survive the bootstrapping regime where necessary server spending outstrips revenue), or your code is too inefficient for your business model to be viable (making $X in revenue costs more than $X worth of server resources, the ""bootstrapping"" regime has no end).<p>> 1-2 GB Ram<p>Upgrade this.  RAM is cheap, and you get a lot of performance out of it.<p>> I haven't done the cost calculation<p>The available information at my fingertips says buying a full rack (40U), power included, costs $650 per month [1].  So that's $16.25 per 1U.  That leaves $3.75 per month, or $180 total over a 4-year lifetime.  Let's say you use a Raspberry Pi as the server, it costs $35.  That leaves $145, or $3.02 per server per month, to pay for bandwidth, labor, billing/accounting, storage media, power cables, networking gear, and profit for the owner.<p>$20 is really aggressive pricing.  $30 might be more reasonable.<p>If you have sunk costs, then you might be able to make it work.  E.g. if you just signed a multiyear deal for a ton of rack space, but the project you were planning on using it for isn't going to fly due to your cofounder getting hit by a bus, you can regard the rent on server space as a sunk cost since you'll be paying for it anyway.  Filling it with $20/month servers would almost certainly be better than letting it sit idle (though maybe not better than filling it with more expensive servers, subletting it to someone else, or having your company declare bankruptcy).",1369621067

The problem is I'm a Coldfusion developer. I have these ideas that I want to create, but I don't want to write them in Coldfusion. I would like to use something like Ruby, Python, Go, or even Scala. I've taken Coursera courses on Ruby and Scala. I do understand them enough to go through the courses, but it's hard to grok the environment.<p>I've been a Windows guy, and just recently bought a Macbook, hoping it would push me into learning the environment. But in reality it's been a bit of culture shock. I get confused using all of these tools. I tried setting up my machine with Boxen, until I couldn't figure out the error it was throwing and got frustrated and reinstalled. I think this is the third time I've reinstalled OSX.<p>Homebrew, ZSH (and oh-my-zsh), Puppet/Chef, Vagrant, Rails, Gems, Rake, rvm, rbenv, Node, npm, Angular/Ember/Backbone, virtualenv, pip, etc, etc. Even things like git, setting up ssh/certificates, and just generally command-line things are intimidating.<p>I get that a lot of people just intuitively know these now, because they 'grew up' with them, so to speak. But to someone just trying to get into it's incredibly overwhelming.<p>Things like TDD are foreign to me too. I understand it at a high-level, but actually writing tests is hard for me.<p>I know things well enough to know that I should use it, but not enough to know how to use it.<p>I want to write software, but I don't want to write bad software. I definitely suffer from analysis-paralysis. If I don't know that I'm doing it right, I find it hard to start. One of my ideas is something related to bitcoin, so I know that it will be attempted to be hacked. That brings a whole new aspect in hardening servers, writing secure code, auditing, etc.<p>I'm just at my wit's end. Maybe you all could point me in the right direction.",1369620433
