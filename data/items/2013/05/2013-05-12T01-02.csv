Rather than correct his mispelling, most developers familiar with Internet Explorer appreciated the visual imagery.

I have only rarely used PM software, so I really cannot speak to it, but I have been inflicted with bad PMs for the vast majority of my time.<p>My observation is that it is the way that PMs approach the process of PM, not the software that makes the difference. As long as projects start out with a due date and a cool name, it doesn't matter what the software is or does or doesn't do, because the project is doomed already. Who needs estimates when the completion date has already been carved into stone?<p>The in-house methodology states that requirements will be gathered and estimates will be collected and they'll be put into the approved software and then they will begin to suffer from bit rot because they were bad to start with and will never be revisited. The requirements are always incomplete because there are whole aspects of software development that are never considered, especially testing and creating administration capabilities. The estimates are always wrong because projects are rarely enough like previous ones to make prior experience useful, programmers are by nature optimistic and project managers are people pleasers. (I've seen my careful estimates cut in half right in front of me.)

Anyone recall the differences between [const const {star}], [const {star} const], etc ?<p>Language design has come a long way since the early 80's.  His concerns back then were a programming language that would retain the performance of 'C' on most hardware and be straightforward to generate from 'C' code due to re-use of the 'C' syntax (the early C++ systems relied on converters that translated C++ to 'C').  Over time compilers were created to generate machine code straight from C++.  When 4k was a lot of RAM, it made sense to focus on this; it still does if you're developing embedded software with very limited hardware.  (FWIW, I've written software in C++ since 1990).<p>I'd argue hard that today, in most cases, and in particular in web applications, the issue is developer productivity.  Today we're focusing more on expressing solutions in code that are much closer to the way that we think. Whether it's Ruby, F#, Scala, or Javascript, the tools we're using allow for more powerful solutions in far less code and complexity than C++.<p>Let the flames begin..",1368321482
