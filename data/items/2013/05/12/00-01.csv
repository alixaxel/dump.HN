5692706,comment,5692001,5692001,2,0,pianopiano,,,"Whereas guitars are tuned by setting the dominant frequency of each string to a fixed reference, which can be easily automated, this is not the case for a piano.<p>This is because each piano string is governed by a non-linear differential equation describing its motion. The overtones therefore are not simple multiples of the fundamental frequency but instead appear displaced from where they would naively be expected. Although there is a strong systematic variation to these displacements, there is also a random component, rooted in difficult-to-characterize variations in the manufacture of each string.<p>Thus, each string unto itself has a unique Fourier spectra, and not only do the fundamentals need to be matched in frequency so as to minimize dissonance, but the higher modes as well.<p>Thus, ach piano has its own tuning, unique its constituent parts. (And, there may be multiple tunings for a single piano.)<p>Further, we do not have an adequate mathematical characterization of the sensation of 'dissonance' and thus the job of a professional piano tuner is to minimize this sensation when a pair of strings is played.<p>Though there are electronic systems for selecting the proper piano string fundamental, they can differ by as much as ten cents (10% of the distance between one note and the next) from a professional tuning.<p>Therefore, we can put a man on the moon, but we do not know how to tune a piano!",1368320141

Daily electricity demand fluctuates in Ontario by thousands of MW, so much so that houses in Ontario are now fitted with time of use meters, which charge variable rates depending on the time of the day. These meters are going to be installed in your neighborhood if they aren't already.<p>Now where do electric cars come into the mix? During the day, electricity consumption reaches a peak, and consumer prices are doubled from ~6c/KWh to ~12c/KWh. This isn't a cash grab, different facilities charge different rates for electricity generation depending on a bunch of different factors. With millions of electric cars, and with the aid of a ""smart grid"" that could learn to supply power to cars during the night and drain a small portion of power during the day, the massive fluctuations of electricity production through-out the day could be flattened out, and ""dirty"" backup plants could be taken offline. As a car owner, you could possibly be paid for you're car's storage capacity when electricity prices spike.<p>Another benefit of going electric, the ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) is wasteful. ICEs work most efficiently at a specific rpm, which is hard to maintain when your car demands that torque to be dynamic, energy is lost at the transmission stage. ICEs need to be cooled down, the vast majority of energy is lost to heat. Take that same fuel but instead use it to power a steam turbine, and you capture much more thermal energy from the fuel. Electric motors also boast efficiency values upwards of 90%<p>And finally, electric engines when at a stop don't use electricity. I don't know the stats on this one but I would have to bet that billions of liters of gas are burned each year at stop lights, traffic, and at warm up. You can also regenerate energy through breaking in an electric car, instead of turning it straight to heat at the break pad.<p>Sure there are other points to be made, and sure my comment was probably disjointed, but as a mech eng, I lose sleep at how inefficient the ICE is. I dream of the day when battery density, and cost come down significantly and make it more affordable for a middle class family to own one of these cars.",1368319193

And GPLv3 to boot (compared to nginx's awesome BSD-based license).<p>Here's from Wikipedia:<p><i>According to a Netcraft May 2006 web server survey, LiteSpeed powered over 254,000 domains and was the 6th most popular web server platform in the world.[3] By August 2007 it had fallen to the 19th position, with its customer base falling below 150,000;[4] however, it rebounded to the 11th position as of January 2008, with its customer base raising above 430,000,[5] only to drop to 26th by January 2009 with a base below 90,000.[6] According to W3Techs, it is used by 1.9% of all websites.[7]</i><p>This move would have saved them.... 7 years ago. LiteSpeed won't poach any of nginx's userbase, but it's compatibility with Apache configuration might, <i>just might</i> give it some ex-Apache users.... then again, Apache still wins out in terms of license (Apache, obviously), community support, modules, etc. [EDIT: See comments below. No Apache compatibility for the free version]<p>For example, SPDY and mod_pagespeed are huge fads right now. Apache and Nginx have both, thanks to awesome contributors and Google itself.

5692649,comment,5692049,5692555,2,0,tzs,,,"There was some discussion of this in Professor Abu-Mostafa's ""Learning from Data"" class at Caltech. You can use machine learning techniques to build systems that are very good at saying whether or not you should give someone credit. If your system say no, though, you have to tell the applicant why credit was denied.<p>The banks are pretty sure that they can't get away with just saying ""well, this big black box that we got some Caltech professor to build for us looked at all our prior customers and decided you are too similar to the bad ones"". They need to say something specific.<p>I wonder if one could approach this by fiddling the inputs and rerunning the check, trying to find a reasonable minimal tweak that would produce approval. Then report those tweaked parameters as being the reason for credit denial. For example, if you deny a car loan, run the check again with higher income, and if you find that this gets an approval, report that the loan was denied because their income was too low.<p>I asked about this on the class forums, and Abu-Mostafa said it was interesting, but he didn't know if it would satisfy the legal requirements.",1368318367

The default sh on most UNIX boxes are either ash or a hard link to ksh which emulates the POSIX definition of sh. zsh and bash also provide the option to hard or soft link so depending on your distro you may have /bin/sh linked to bash.<p>Debian at one point repackaged the BSD almquist shell as their system sh calling it dash mainly for speed and stability.
