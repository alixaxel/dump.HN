It's hard to find a molecular biology paper that doesn't owe a ton to having the full human genome sequence. There have also been technology side effects. Just like defense projects fueled the early market for silicon-based semiconductors, the HGP kick-started a market for sequencing machines that is generating a huge revolution in sequencing technology where costs are now falling 5x-10x per year, which is quite a bit faster than Moore's law.<p>In terms of finding genetic causes of disease, this happens every day, and is practically mundane, but there are two complications towards getting to cures. First, most disease is far far more complicated than a single gene; any single gene may account for just a percent or two of what we call the same disease. Second, knowing which gene is broken does not provide a cure for that disease; even for a given small molecule, determining if it will interact with a gene's protein or have any effect on that protein's structure or function is a task that physics has not been able to tackle. Additionally, the genome has only been available for a mere decade, and for many if not most diseases, the process of going from a known gene target  an approved drug is going to take far longer than 10 years.<p>So the HGP has fueled a huge amount of discovery, is the foundation of nearly all human biology research, and is completely indispensable, but in terms of new cures for various diseases it has not delivered, <i>yet</i>, but really it shouldn't have to.",1367736412

Just becasue it's called ""Design"" it doesn't mean it can only be done by people with ""Designer"" on their titles. It seems that the only reason we are separating ""Development"" as another dicipline incapable of doing some of the things we call ""Design"" it's because we don't call it ""Code Design"".<p>A visual designer is as capable of developing a useful and functional ui design as a developer. Even if one is called ""designer"" and the other is not. Stylizing is another matter.<p>PS: My point is that some of the activities we are calling ""Design"" are VERY different to some of the other activities we are calling ""Design"". We lump them together because, well, they are called ""Design"".

If someone is not satisfied with  the work environment, it is not as simple as going to a better place. Someone else will gladly take over their position as it is still going to be a top job in India.<p>Since a lot of these software companies operate as satellite offices for major US firms, their primary goal is to maximize the margin for these firms, so they will do the bare minimum to get by.<p>I especially love Bollywood movies that portray software jobs and also call center jobs similar to the US but the reality is far from the truth.",1367734177
5657600,comment,5656249,5657556,1,0,philwelch,,,"If you think of it in terms of job openings, sure, but that's myopic. I'm thinking of it in terms of the number of people who could be profitably utilized to improve the material well-being of humanity. My notion of the ""work that needs to be done"" is in no way limited to what current job openings exist. In fact, there's likely an infinite amount of work that needs to be done. The limiting factor is the number of people capable of doing it.<p>For instance, what if we multiplied by one hundred the number of researchers working on major problems like fusion power or eradicating disease? There isn't anywhere close that number of people qualified to be physicists or medical researchers, though, so it simply isn't considered. There are probably enough unsolved problems in materials science alone to profitably employ twice the number of currently unemployed people for a lifetime, except all those unemployed people are almost certainly incapable of becoming materials scientists.<p>My job, and likely yours, filled a ""job opening"" that only existed because someone else did the basic work of building the technology and the infrastructure to enable the creation of that job. The more people you have doing that work, the more job openings pop into existence. Don't think of it in the sense of Google or Amazon having only so many job openings, and once those are filled, that's that. Think of it in the sense of Tim Berners-Lee building something that enabled every single job at Google or Amazon to exist in the first place.<p>It doesn't even have to be that radical. A healthy, growing company expands at a rate that's eventually limited by the number of people it can hire. Once it hires those people, it expands its operations until it needs more. So even on the most basic level, simply counting job openings misses all the job openings that would be created once the first batch was filled, and so on recursively.",1367734155

5657594,comment,5653802,5653802,1,0,crazydiamond,,,"1. Yes, I meditate. As of now I don't do sitting eyes-closed meditations regularly (I should). I keep up the state of not-attaching to thought, of remaining in ""presence"" (also called the I-am or Being). Once you get it, you will recognize what I mean.<p>2. Meditation has side benefits of helping with concentration problems, sleep issues, maybe even some psychological issues (there's a lot on it if you google 'meditation and neuro-science').<p>However, the original and main purpose of meditation was what is called ""liberation"" or awakening or enlightenment. Along the way, the grip of the fictional mind-created entity called the ""self"" or ""me"" weakens and at some stage just collapses. In a few cases this happens suddenly with no practice (e.g. Eckhart Tolle, Sri Ramana Maharshi). What happens further you will just have to experience yourself but this much I can say: as the false self or ""ego"" weakens and loses control, suffering also reduces and a time comes when you know that mental suffering is over for you.<p>There is far too much material on this. You can spend a whole life just reading (and as a result yourself get nowhere). Everyone will have their favorite books or resources or people. I would recommend Power of Now by Tolle as a very accessible book. There is also Sri Nisargadatta (I am That, and many other works, available on the internet freely in text/pdf form).<p>Most threads on HN recommend mindfulness and give you links to documents for that. Mindfulness puts the attention on the body and thus takes it away from the mental process. The references I gave (similarly) take the attention away from mind to what is present or aware (without going to the body). So these approaches still have a lot in common.<p>Whichever route you take, it is important to start practicing (stilling the mind) asap, and not get caught in the reading trap.",1367733891

Needing variety in envelopes, 'Jiffy' bags and stamps I did <i>try</i> and get the stationary from the Post Office. But it cost an absolute fortune.<p>I thought envelopes cost mere pennies, a fraction of the price of a stamp. But no, at the Post Office they cost more than the stamps.<p>It was also costlier in time than I thought it would be, lunchtimes weren't grab-a-sandwich-and-sit-at-the-desk, I would be out for half an hour or more if a full postal visit was needed.<p>After a while I started buying stamps elsewhere and using the stack of envelopes I purchased some time back in 2007. In this way I could avoid spending inordinate amount of time in the dingy Post Office. A lot of the stamps I bought this way were really old, pre-dating the 2012 Olympics. I got the feeling that nobody is buying stamps any more.<p>Not so recently the post in the UK was delivered before people set off for their working day, then it all got a bit more casual. Then before that there was a time when people could have half a dozen or more separate deliveries in a day. It won't be long before we no longer have Saturday deliveries and envelopes become a quaint speciality item,  generally available 'free' with birthday cards but otherwise as hard to obtain as perforated dot-matrix printer paper.",1367733692
