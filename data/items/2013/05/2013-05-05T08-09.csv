And yet, those who work in these jobs needs to be fed, clothed etc. So who provides these resources to keep these people alive while they perform non-productive, exploratory jobs? Basic income _may_, but that just shifts the cost to the entity giving the basic income, instead of the investor who take the risk and profit from the outcome of the research/exploratory work.<p>The bottom line is, there isn't enough free resources out there to support such endeavours, as much as i like it to be true.

5657867,comment,5657675,5657675,8,0,tikhonj,,,"Heh, the car comparison really does resonate with me: I like the Porsche <i>far</i> more because it is a <i>simple</i> design, aesthetically. Sure, the actual implementation--the weird engine position and all the mechanisms needed to compensate for it--is relatively complicated. But this does not compromise the minimalist aesthetic. Quite a nice feeling, especially for a car from that era. The great performance is just a boost.<p>The Cadillac, on the other hand, is probably simpler mechanically. It's a much more conservative, reasonable car: after all, who would be mad enough to put an engine at the <i>rear</i> of their sports car? But, wow, is the design <i>busy</i>. Little fiddly bits, fins, wheel-covers, too much chrome...<p>Perhaps the best way to think about it is that the Porsche is a car with a small surface area (metaphorically) and a large depth. The Cadillac is the opposite: larger surface are but less depth. I much prefer the former.<p>And this preference carries over into programming languages. I always like a language with nice aesthetics--simple semantics--even if it's harder to implement efficiently. I want a language which is simultaneously simpler and more flexible than the alternatives. And good performance certainly wouldn't hurt!<p>At a high level, these qualities mirror preferring the Porsche, which is why I like this metaphor. Sure, it's not perfect--but it isn't supposed to be. I don't even think of it as an argument in favor of one aesthetic over another; instead, I think it's just a great way to describe why I like what I like.",1367743503

Founder<p>5 Reasons to move to Berlin (thanks Node.js - great summary)
1. Lowest livings costs with highest standard of living. Stay in gorgeous, perfectly renovated apartments in pre-WWII residential buildings with high ceilings, right in the middle of the center and pay a fraction of costs of any other capital (even cheaper than any Eastern European capital). No need for a carBerlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun + we have Car2Go and Drive-Now (these are world's best smartphone-supported car sharing systems with brand new cars at every corner, cheaper than owning a car or riding a cab). In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).
2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird, Mozilla and many more).
3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and internationalno need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.
4. Easy work permissionsEuropeans do not need any and can work from day one.
5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.
Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe. If you are passionate about building great software, wed love to talk with you. If you don't live in Berlin yet, we could help to fix that.",1367742161

I don't see any breakdown by geography, and wall street had been all worried about what that means for an ever-more-mobile world, but, again, the data isn't there to back up your supposition.

The languages that were consciously designed for ""average"" programmers (Cobol, Pascal, Ada) have tended to be evolutionary dead ends.</i><p>COBOL and Pascal (via Delphi) are probably used more than Smalltalk and Lisp in the real world. Also, Java and C#, designed for the 'average' programmer, are immensely popular outside our little bubble. Java has been around for twenty years and will probably be for at least two more decades.<p>I like tinkering with new and 'revolutionary' languages - I wrote a fair share of Prolog and Haskell, but I have come to the realisation that that I like to solve interesting problems (mostly in NLP and machine learning) far more. And when you focus on solving an interesting problem it can be good that the language and ecosystem are boring and predictable (Java, C, C++), so that you can focus at the problem at hand. For example, in Java you can easily add a library to a project via Maven and its usage will often be completely predictable, you don't have to deal with the fact that the library writer was in an existential typing, GADT, or arrows phase and fight with its API.<p>BTW.
