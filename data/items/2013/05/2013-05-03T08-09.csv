Sure, that sucks for export businesses, so it is not without cost.<p>It is almost comical when people present government protections as making it worse compared to US conditions, which are at a level that most Europeans shudder at the thought of being subjected to US working conditions.

Geek discovers that once installed, newest version of Windows has $major_user_interface_drawback (no start button / is slow / looks designed for children / etc).<p>4.  Geek concludes that the masses will reject this version of Windows (and perhaps adopt $Linux_distro_of_choice instead).<p>This fails to account for:<p>a.  The increased likelihood that a geek's PC (-v- a non-geek's PC) will encounter problems upgrading Windows due to<p>a.i. having another OS installed (dual booting);<p>a.ii. having relatively esoteric hardware installed.<p>b.  The vast number of Windows installs out there; and thus the relatively high number of failed installs/upgrades that can occur based on a low failure rate.<p>c.  As geeks we are relatively likely to hear about problems other geeks are having.<p>Tldr: this is not the sort of anecdotal evidence that will persuade me Windows is dying.<p>(Am I saying that there are no problems with Windows 8? Or that Windows is categorically NOT dying and NOT being superseded? No. But the linked blog post is not terribly relevant to that debate.)",1367569327

The bitcoin devs are pretty clear that the bitcoin network and blockchain should not be used for messaging or store non transaction related data.<p>What actually is happening here, is that miners have the opportunity to put a small amount of arbitrary data in a block when they mine.  Ideally this is should be random data, its purpose is to change the data being hashed so you get a different hash each time you try.<p>In my view the author of bitcoin set a bad precedent by including a newspaper headline referring to bank bailouts in the very first block.  However I can't begrudge him for that too much.  Since 2009, people have included prayers and accusations of illegal activity (trolling) in blocks.<p>Assuming increased bitcoin adoption, I see mining getting more and more centralized, already I don't think any of the major mining pools would be silly enough to include CP or other illegal content.  It would take many blocks to store a non trivial sized image in the blockchain, and if they put a link in instead then of course the host could be taken down.",1367569063
