This is a lot less convenient from a practical perspective. There's an additional baseboard you can get but it's huge or I guess you can put your own blocks on.<p>* the Beaglebone comes w/ two PRUs if you need to do real-time work this is pretty sweet<p>* For general I/O, libraries like PyBBIO and Bonescript make the Beaglebone dead simple to program with. As far as I can tell, to access GPIO for the Cubieboard, there's a custom kernel module driver you'll need to install to access via /sys and no clear docs on PWM or other ""basic"" stuff.<p>Also looks like right now, the Cubieboard is a lot less mature and it's unclear what the timeline is for it to get better - for example, looking at the Google Groups threads, looks like there's the VPU/GPU acceleration is a bit finicky (the Cubieboard uses Mali-400, Beaglebone uses SGX530, both closed source/binary only drivers).

But you still won't get what he's saying unless you're already a follower and have digested the ideas in his blog.<p>Venkat trades in big, hairy concepts. The one he's using here is <i>legibility</i>. It's when information is structured in rigorous ways, defined by those using it as an instrument of power. It is the primary tool governments use against the people. An example is making every person have a current address listed on their driver's license. Governments stack these legibility requirements up so as to control commerce and extract rents. (taxes)<p>Venkat's argument is that investors won the game by forcing founders to be legible, reducing the information advantage they enjoyed historically. While it may look like founders have never had more power, in reality they've lost a crucial ability, to hoard critical inside information. It's really the only advantage they have, without it, they're at the mercy of investors. The ability to dictate terms is really inconsequential, more a function of fashion than actual power.

If the SEC didn't drag its feet, we'd have lots of new people entering the startup market on the investor side, and presenting much more supply of investment money (and competition from the investor side).<p>People at the SEC, however, (such as Mary Schapiro, who since left), are concerned about protecting non-accredited investors who may be affected, and the agency has even taken heat from many members of Congress for taking so long:<p><a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/11/us-sec-jobsact-idUSBRE93A0JB20130411"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/11/us-sec-jobsact-idU...</a><p>If they would at least drop the ban on general solicitation -- as they were expected to do last August -- then many entrepreneurs with large user bases could solicit investment through messaging those users, and inviting them to introduce their rich (accredited) investor friends to the company.",1367565649
