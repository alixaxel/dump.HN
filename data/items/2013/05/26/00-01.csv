When an industry transitions from mandated prices to open price competition the profit formula changes. It is logical that carriers would prefer efficient, reliable, high capacity planes over faster alternatives post deregulation. Also, given the small number of plane manufacturers and the huge costs of R&D to bring out a new plane, it is unlikely a manufacturer would invest in building a supersonic jet that does not meet the current operating needs of its clients. Maybe Elon will do planes next?

5769532,comment,5768737,5769482,2,0,michaelochurch,,,"I think that my anger/negativity come from two sources, that I've conflated even though they're separate.<p>1. I consider the ratio between how much value programmers <i>do</i> add and what we <i>could</i> add to be unacceptably low. (See: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/programmer-autonomy-is-a-1-trillion-issue/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/11/25/programmer-au...</a> .) It means we have low leverage, few opportunities to excel, and that we can rarely become financially independent. It sucks to lose 90+ percent of what we're capable of to the fact that the wrong people call the shots.<p>2. I had a 16-month period (1/11 to 4/12) in my career that was astonishingly negative. First, I had a startup fail for reasons that were not my fault and completely out of my control. Then, I had a manager at Google for whom I found out recently that recruiters consider him to be the worst manager in Google NYC (my perceived pattern of him using fake performance problems to tease out health issues then fuck with people is actually well-known; N >= 5 and probably 7, but not knowing all the individual details, I'm unsure on duplicates). Third, I observed something that I can't talk about but would be legendary if it got out. Fourth, I worked for a startup with the most unethical management I've ever encountered (worse than Google; Google's a good company with some really bad actors and terrible HR infrastructure, this company's management was just rotten all the way through) and, after I left it, the CEO (the black sheep of a powerful family) mounted a personal campaign to destroy my reputation.<p>So... (1) is why my fights matter to the world. We really do need to unlock the trillions of dollars of value we'll add to the world by making programmers more autonomous and powerful within organizations.

5769446,comment,5769166,5769166,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>but really people who think dynamic typing is suitable for large scale software development are just nuts</i><p>Flame-bait. I happen to like static typing-- and I'd be excited to see more progress with optional static typing in Clojure-- but I disagree.<p>First of all, you can pretty easily get principled strong typing with a language like Clojure. One of the first things I write on a large Clojure project is defn-typed. If types were a major part of what I was doing (e.g. theorem proving) that wouldn't be acceptable, but for web programming it's generally enough. It's pretty easy using a few macros to make it so that you get almost all of the guarantees (from unit testing) that you'd get from compile-time type checking.<p>Remember: dynamic typing doesn't mean you <i>don't have</i> types. You can include types in your contract system. It means that type sanity isn't checked at compile-time. For certain problems that require extremely high levels of correctness, you need static error-checking/analysis because runtime unit testing isn't good enough. For <i>every</i> large system? No, not the case. What you need, in general, are good programmers and sane development practices; those matter a lot more than static vs. dynamic.<p>My experience is that static typing performs best when you're trying to solve a known problem extremely well, and that's not an uncommon thing in software. Dynamic typing is better-suited to a more chaotic world where you don't know the problem yet, because it makes it easier to ""poke"" at things in the REPL and build prototypes.<p>Also, improperly used, static and dynamic typing both fall down disastrously on large or distributed systems. For example, if you have circular dependencies in a large Scala project (""don't do that"", you might say; but we're talking multi-developer now, with the full spectrum of skill) you're going to see gargantuan compile times because incremental compiles will fail you, and while Scala's compiler is an extremely powerful machine, it's not fast.<p>All this said, Haskell is still a very cool language and I think everyone who wants to be a serious computer scientist needs to get some exposure to what it has to offer. <i>Real World Haskell</i> is a great book, for starters. I also think Scala is great if you have strong developers who won't be tempted to OOP things up.",1369527287
