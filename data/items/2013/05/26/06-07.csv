5770260,comment,5770086,5770086,3,0,mc-lovin,,,"Here is why I think a basic income is a bad idea.<p>By way of introduction, basic income is very similar to welfare or negative income taxation.  Welfare already exists, and can be made completely unconditional on everything but income should governments choose.  All of these methods can be thought of as a map from pre-govt-intervention earnings, to post-govt-intervention earnings, i.e.<p>after_tax(income) = income - tax(income) + welfare(income) + basic income = income - effective_tax(income)<p>The problem with basic income is that it is a barrier to thinking holistically about the above equation.<p>For example, a claimed benefit of basic income, is that unlike welfare, it does not decrease when you start to earn money (i.e. it is not conditional on income), and therefore does not provide a disincentive to work. In terms of the above formula, the derivative of effective_tax at 0 is close to 0.  However, the cost of this is that the derivative of effective_tax must be higher at some other points.  So while the poor have more incentive to work, the middle class and rich have less.  The perfect system would be a balancing act between these forces, and the idea of basic income confuses the issue by suggesting there is something special about what is essential an arbitrary effective tax rate.<p>Another issue is that welfare can be targeted to certain groups, and have strings attached.  I personally am not a big fan of targeting welfare towards particular groups, with the exception of the disabled and certain ethnic minorities.  However attaching strings to welfare is a complex political, social and economic question for which there are no easy answers.  I don't believe that ""no strings attached"" is the optimal solution.<p>Therefore I think that while making welfare more streamlined, less conditional on things other than income, and not dropping off too fast with income, are all ideas that need further investigation (and all of these are well studied by economists), advocating a basic income has a negative effect on both the political debate, and our conceptual understanding of the issues.",1369549698

5770209,comment,5769166,5769737,2,0,millstone,,,"Reference counting is surely not state of the art, and very definitely un-fancy, but what it has going for it is that it strikes a good balance: reasonably efficient, predictable and bounded memory usage, plays nicely with others (no worrying about scanning other heaps / object pinning / etc). Where reference counting shines is that its memory usage has a lower high-water mark than any GC algorithm.<p>Garbage collection has a lot going for it too, but any garbage collecting algorithm will suffer from at least one of the problems you mention, in varying degrees. Reads and writes should not require memory management code, like updating a refcount? That rules out a large class of GC concurrent/generational algorithms that depend on read and write barriers. No extra memory on a per-object basis? This rules out many incremental mark-and-sweep algorithms that store the object color. (True, the color may be implemented with a side table, but so also may reference counts.) Play nicely with concurrent threads? This rules out a large class of stop-the-world collectors. Cache friendly? This rules out semispace copying collectors, which may even page in memory from disk during a collection.<p>I'd say the evidence shows that GC performs best when there's lots of memory available and low interactivity, so it's a good choice for server-type applications. For interactive applications with limited memory, especially mobile apps/games, GC is more problematic, and it's not so clear. I don't know if the GCs in XNA or Android are ""halfway-decent"", but they both have significant overhead that causes real performance issues.",1369548092
