5666823,comment,5665302,5665302,7,0,drostie,,,"About 10 years ago I read a ton of Karl Marx, and the biggest thing which struck me was that the vocabulary to describe what he was talking about was not invented until modern times -- he talks of the ""mechanisation of the means of production,"" which we can distil down to ""robots.""<p>In this view, Marx's critique is actually pretty simple. In your first economics class a good teacher probably dismantled any idea in your head that value is objective -- it's based on fiat and caprice; ""everything is worth what its purchaser will pay for it,"" and ""banks in this sense really create money,"" and so on. If it was a really good teacher you should some days like awake at night wondering <i>no, really, why the hell does the economic system work?!</i> or so.<p>Marx isn't satisfied with the economist's sort of relativism; he wants to ""get to the heart of the matter"". Marx wants to anchor value in, first, <i>usage</i> -- food has value because it nourishes you. But he also settles on the <i>work</i> that went into the object, which is an objective fact of history (which leads to long German sentences where it almost sounds like labour is a substance inside the object).<p>Marx wants to distinguish <i>artistic</i> work (which we do purely for its own sake) from <i>drudge</i> work which we do to ""make a living"". He takes those words literally; he views drudge work as a form of slavery -- perhaps <i>wage slavery</i>, but slavery nonetheless. He reasons that the whole system only works due to this generalized slavery. He thus reinterprets history as a set of slave revolts, where things get better only because people reclaim rights from their ruling classes. (This also drives his criticism of religion, which is basically ""religion makes you feel good which is admirable in a sense, but also troubling -- because it makes you less likely to revolt against the real causes of your pain."")<p>Today, he says, people are able to produce more because they have robots at their disposal, so a few farmers can feed many people. In some respects robots also alienate you more, working with them feels more like drudge-work, less like art. But he envisions a day when robots will take over all of the drudge; you will just design an object and some 3D printer will take care of actually producing that object for you.<p>In this system, he says, the classical ideas of money and exchange and capital itself no longer fundamentally make sense; robot slaves will take care of all of your mundane \nneeds (think of Maslow's hierarchy here), which means that when you wake up you won't need to worry about where you will live or what you will eat. Robot slaves do the drudge work, humans are left to be artistic beings. We don't need money -- a medium of exchange -- precisely because the robot slaves will take care of the actual nuts-and-bolts of exchanging, so that we are simply sharing.<p>This also opens the way for new criticisms of Marx like ""what if we all just vegetate in front of TVs and the Internet and society at this point stagnates?"" and so forth. It also explains why the Marxists want to say that the Soviet Union wasn't communism: the gulags were human slaves, not robot slaves.<p>I'm not saying Marx is right, I'm just saying that we're finally reaching the point where the pop culture is beginning to engage with <i>his issues</i>. His solutions are going to be naturally limited because he was writing 200 years before robots could be an everyday thing, and even today it's not clear that robots can someday solve all of our problems; good pattern recognition is still a huge obstacle for example.",1367909554

5666758,comment,5644880,5663053,2,0,apkdn,,,"I fully understand why logging is disabled.  What I am just pointing out is that the numbers that you see are probably not indicative of a framework's production performance.  I realize that logging does add another variable to the mix but in my opinion, it is something worth knowing as it gives an idea of the actual performance of a framework.  And on the contrary, I find that logging impacts performance noticeably depending on the implementation and granularity.  I also think that cleaning up the logs on server shutdown should be fairly trivial.  However, there are the cons you also listed that's quite a compelling argument for disabled logging.<p>As for sessions, I just used Yesod as an example but it applies to all frameworks and other ""middleware"" as well and this is something I am mixed on. Some platforms do not support any middleware at all so should these also be classified as ""stripped"" or ""barebones"" also?  What I'm getting at is, is this really a fair comparison?  From a glance on the benchmark page, it is not apparent which frameworks have which configuration or feature if you're not familiar with the framework itself and it can get really complicated.  I think labeling the frameworks in terms of size is a huge step in the right direction but my belief is that more information is needed.",1367907482

It was rumored that Adobe recognized this and actually had no problem with the piracy, realizing that they could make up for it with the high sticker price that legit customers paid.

It is naked extortion covered by a thin veneer of lawyering. Rules don't matter. Honesty doesn't matter. Decency doesn't matter. Whatever it takes to keep the scheme going, right or wrong, fair or foul, justified or not.<p>The result: not a severe money sanction, which would have been but a slap on the wrist when many millions had been gathered under the lawyers' scheme, and apparently gathered tax free to boot. Instead, something much worse, to wit, a clear conclusion that the lawyers had engaged in acts of moral turpitude, justifying referral to the state bar of every jurisdiction in which they are authorized to practice, and likely eventual disbarment; a criminal referral to the U.S. attorneys' office for possible RICO violations; a referral to the tax authorities; and an order that this devastating order be served and filed in every single legal action that has been filed by these attorneys anywhere in the nation.<p>This, to put it mildly, amounts to evisceration.
