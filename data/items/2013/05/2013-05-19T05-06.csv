The girl who was driving the car was very nice about everything and even offered me a ride into the city (more than 45 minutes) even though she lived in the opposite direction. The tow truck driver charged me only half the normal rate because ""we gotta stick together"" and he rode bikes too. Lots of people who were around near the accident helped immobilize my arm after the injury. The friendly folks down at Motoshop unloaded the bike and removed some of the ugly bits sticking out.

(that's not necessarily a bad thing)<p>They put 2 projectors on the glasses, pointing out.  These are obviously extremely weak because they're so small, but the trick is shining the light at a retro-reflector [1] which bounces almost all the light directly back where it came from.<p>So even though the projectors are so dim you'd barely be able to see the image normally, it's apparently bright enough since a significant fraction of the light energy is bounced directly back to your eye.  I assume they're using 2 projectors because the angle of return is so focused that it wouldn't be sufficient to use one projector between the eyes.<p>My only confusion is I don't get what this has to do with augmented reality.  All that cleverness just emulates what a normal monitor can do - display an image to a person.  The head tracking stuff is a completely independent system of camera and IR light, just like a wiimote sensor.
