After a month, I cancelled the subscription via my google wallet subscriptions. To my surprise, the next month I received another $1.99 charge. So I cancelled it, and sent a message to the app maker through Google Wallet -- no reply. The next month, another charge. I cancelled it, this time, went looking on the app makers website, found an unsubscribe form, thought, ""ahh, here we go,"" never heard from them. Next month, $1.99 charge. I cancel it and after 5 minutes of intense clicking, find a number to google wallet customer service!!! I called, explained my situation, reconfirmed my credit cards, addresses, email, name, etc, to be told to fill out a form, wait 3-5 business days to receive an email from someone that should be able to fix my problems. At this point I feel an email won't help me, so I ask, ""Are you sure there isn't a phone number? I would really like to get this resolved today"" politely. I was then informed that the specialists are not yet reachable by phone. So, I'm waiting now for a reply from a specialist who will hopefully solve my problem.<p>Imagine you're at the store register with your kids and your credit card is declined wrongly. Embarrassed, you leave your cart, call the bank, explain your situation, and they say, ""We're sorry to hear that, we are emailing you a form, please fill it out.

Over the years I've leaned towards a policy of generally being pretty open about my identity online.  I find that since I'm the kind of person who doesn't give a shit what you (the abstract ""you"") thinks about me anyway, it doesn't much matter if ""you"" know who I am.  And to whatever extent I <i>do</i> care, choosing to post as ""real me"" forces me to be a little hair more thoughtful and helps avoid the temptation to occasionally stoop to trolling, or saying caustic/hurtful things that I might be tempted to say.<p>Very rarely I will delete or edit a comment due to regret over what I said, but not terribly often.  However, I do now find that I occasionally hold back on saying certain things about the government / government agencies / police / etc. out of a pragmatic desire not to wind up on a ""no fly"" list or something, when my $DAYJOB entails a lot of air travel.  I feel sick everytime I hold back on saying something of that nature though, as it runs counter to my nature.  I try <i>very</i> hard to live a principled life as much as I can, and restricting myself from speaking freely causes a lot of cognitive dissonance.<p>Edit: Also, just to throw another thought or two out there... I prefer having my real info here, as I see this forum as still largely being ""Startup News"" and I think of this as a place for business talk.  And it's more awkward to do business with people when you don't know who they are, or anything about them.  I also throw in the occasional self-promotional reference to my startup[1], and it would be hard to keep my identify secret, even if I wanted to, and still be open about the startup.  I also like helping people, and to the extent that I have any useful advice or wisdom or knowledge to share, I feel like people will find it more acceptable if they know (or can find) the person behind it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.fogbeam.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fogbeam.com</a>",1368747281

That is the reason businesses accept Bitcoin payments via payment processors, ultimately getting USD.<p>""Of course the government is not going to allow a currency it doesn't control supplant the dollar.

""paranoid"" about my identity, and several to many people have ended up knowing the formal identity behind the pseudonym.  But that has been at my own or our mutual discretion.<p>I chose the words ""formal identity"" because, even while using a pseudonym, I feel people can and do come to know my... ""real"" identity.  What I think and feel and communicate, regardless of the ostensible name attached.  I usually take some considerable care in my communication.  My use of a pseudonym doesn't, in that regard, hide who I am.<p>What a pseudonym <i>does</i> let me do is dissociate certain contexts.<p>I can be a little more open about some past work experiences, here, because they don't ""pop to the top"" upon googling my ""real"" name.  Not that I'm engaging in slander or criticism verging towards abuse.  Mostly, I'm also circumspect about not identifying the other party (e.g employer).  I wish to be able to be fairly honest and open about communicating my experience and thoughts upon same, without having to worry about this raising concern with a current or future employer.  Or... these days, without having to worry about some draconian policy or attitude surprising me with e.g. a SLAPP lawsuit or similar.<p>Rather than picking on particular people or organizations, there are <i>experiences</i> that have taught me things.  Sometimes, things I wish I could have learned a bit more easily and/or sooner.  If I can save the next person a bit or grief, or help them to be a bit happier, then yay!  A pseudonym helps me to go about that without second-guessing every sentence.<p>In another instance (and another pseudonym), I've dealt with concerns that run from ""personal"" through ""health"".  <i>Many</i> people online find much value communicating about such matters in an anonymous or pseudonymous context.  Again, it's about <i>the content</i>, not about the <i>who</i>.  I've witnessed and experienced many significant relationships develop and persist in such pseudonymous contexts.  Some people establish additional private channels and may or may not share identifying information.  But, as I've observed, it's not necessary.<p>And, that brings me to a favorite phrase and attitude of mine, with regard to online communication and to many aspects of technology, as well:<p>Opt in.<p>I'm a strong believer of letting people opt in to choices, such as whether or not to share personally identifying information.<p>If per the meme the Internet or the Web is today's ""Wild West"", then I'll borrow another analogy, or component of this Western mythology and attitude (the attitude part is significantly true, even today):  It's not who you are, it's what you do.<p>Per the Western genre of story, the West was somewhere a person could ""reinvent"" themselves.  It's not who you are, but what you do.<p>On the Internet, I don't think we really ""reinvent"" ourselves.  But, it is a matter of what we do, rather than who we are.<p>Perhaps that's one reason I'm a bit cautious about the influx of photos and other imagery.  I get enough of that in... ""meatspace"", as I guess it's sometimes being called, these days.  ""Real life"".<p>People who succeed to varying degrees on their looks and other external factors.<p>Some days, give me pseudonyms and plain text.  Or code, or the like.  And show me what you think and do.  Even what you feel -- I've seen as much genuine empathy and feeling on a phpBB forum as anywhere else.<p>So... to go a bit beyond the clicky-votey spot above...",1368746829
5721868,comment,5721653,5721653,42,0,MarkMc,,,"Paul Tough's book, ""How Children Succeed"" [1] has a great section on how mothering style has a large effect on  offspring throughout their lives:<p>""Parents and other caregivers who are able to form close, nurturing relationships with their children can foster resilience in them that protects them from many of the worst effects of a harsh early environment. This message can sound a bit warm and fuzzy, but it is rooted in cold, hard science. The effect of good parenting is not just emotional or psychological, the neuroscientists say; it is biochemical.<p>The researcher who has done the most to expand our understanding of the relationship between parenting and stress is a neuroscientist at McGill University named Michael Meaney. Like many in the field, Meaney does much of his research with rats, as rats and humans have similar brain architecture. At any given time, the Meaney lab houses hundreds of rats. They live in Plexiglas cages, and usually each cage holds a mother rat, called a dam, and her small brood of baby rats, called pups.<p>Scientists in rat labs are always picking up baby rats to examine them or weigh them, and one day about ten years ago, researchers in Meaney’s lab noticed a curious thing: When they put the pups back in the cages after handling them, some dams would scurry over and spend a few minutes licking and grooming their pups. Others would just ignore them. When the researchers examined the rat pups, they discovered that this seemingly insignificant practice had a distinct physiological effect. When a lab assistant handled a rat pup, researchers found, it produced anxiety, a flood of stress hormones, in the pup. The dam’s licking and grooming counteracted that anxiety and calmed down that surge of hormones.<p>Meaney and his researchers were intrigued, and they wanted to learn more about how licking and grooming worked and what kind of effect it had on the pups. So they kept watching the rats, spending long days and nights with their faces pressed up against the Plexiglas, and after many weeks of careful observation, they made an additional discovery: different mother rats had different patterns of licking and grooming, even in the absence of their pups' being handled. So Meaney’s team undertook a new experiment, with a new set of dams, to try to quantify these patterns. This time, they didn’t handle any of the pups. They just closely observed each cage, an hour at a time, eight sessions a day, for the first ten days of the pups' lives. Researchers counted every instance of maternal licking and grooming. And after ten days, they divided the dams into two categories: the ones that licked and groomed a lot, which they labeled high LG, and the ones that licked and groomed a little, which they labeled low LG.<p>...<p>The researchers ran test after test, and on each one, the high-LG offspring excelled: They were better at mazes. They were more social. They were more curious. They were less aggressive. They had more self-control. They were healthier. They lived longer. Meaney and his researchers were astounded. What seemed like a tiny variation in early mothering style, so small that decades of researchers hadn’t noticed it, created huge behavioral differences in mature rats, months after the licking and grooming had taken place. And the effect wasn't just behavioral; it was biological too. When Meaney’s researchers examined the brains of the adult rats, they found significant differences in the stress-response systems of the high—LG and low-LG rats, including big variations in the size and shape and complexity of the parts of the brain that regulated stress.""<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/How-Children-Succeed-Curiosity-Character/dp/1452658145"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/How-Children-Succeed-Curiosity-Charact...</a>",1368746773

Well, their walled garden.<p>My impression is that Reader was launched back in the days when they were just doing things for the fun of it. If a 20% time project does well, then you push it out. And then they cared about open standards, which is why you can OPML-export your reader subscriptions.<p>But even at the time they didn't think much about crushing the nascent RSS-reader market. The programmers wanted to build things, so they did. And they liked them to be open, so that's how they ended up.<p>In the last few years, though, they've shifted. Google Plus was a sign that the power shifted from the nerds to the suits. The suits see what Facebook has and want the same. In that period, they just neglected Reader to death. I doubt it was intentional, but they it suited their walled garden urges just fine.<p>Now they've killed it, because it doesn't even do that anymore. As many people have noted, RSS has lost a lot of ground to proprietary sharing. Will it make it back? Would it have lost it anyhow? Hard to say. But a big part of why it's hard to say is Google's dominance.<p>So trying to answer your last question as framed, I guess I'd say that the harm to open standards happened at launch and up until when they killed it. The announcement kicked off a bunch of innovation and interest in newsreaders, and I'm looking forward to seeing how that plays out.",1368746766

What are the possible n-th order effects of having a Games ecosystem, even if it isn't seemingly ""successful"" in isolation?<p>Irrelevant, because Google isn't abandoning the idea of having a ""Games ecosystem"", even one with interacts with Google+ deeply, they are just recognizing that the way to do that isn't to restrict that ecosystem to the G+ Web UI as a portal. That's why the announcement that Google+ Games was being phased out was pretty much simultaneous with the announcement of the availability of the cross-platform (iOS/Android/Web) Google Play Game Services API. (Which is integrated with Google+ -- it subsumes Google+ Sign-On.)<p>> 5. What, if anything, does this say about the possibility of an ""apps"" (non game) ecosystem within G+?<p>The apps-within-social-network-web-interface model, which was dominated by games, is basically dead in favor of apps (including games) that interact with social networks via an API but which are not web applications integrated with the social network web API as the exclusive portal through which they are accessed. So, insofar as you refer to that model for G+ when you refer to an apps ecosystem ""within"" G+, you should probably take the shutdown of G+ games as a recognition that Google has little current interest in that model.<p>As far as an ecosystem of apps (both web and native [especially mobile, in the latter case]) which <i>integrate</i> with G+ features like the message stream, Hangouts, profiles, etc., the recent pushes behind G+ for SSO, the Moments API, the Hangouts API and the move to raise the profile of Hangouts, etc., should be a clue there.",1368746072
