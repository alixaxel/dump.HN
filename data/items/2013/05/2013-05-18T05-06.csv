Modify a library and something stops working fixing it is as simple as `nix-env --rollback` for a user package and `nixos-rebuild --rollback` if something was changed with the system configuration a restart may be needed if some systems are touched but it has not happened often and when it is needed it is specified.<p>I enjoy how easy it is to set up different profiles with different sets of libraries/compilers for development.<p>It has made it worth while to try out old libraries that only work on old compilers. It also made it easier for me to test against the HEAD of the complier repo for testing forward compatibility or new compiler features.<p>Since everything is nicely encapsulated once I have an environment working on my laptop I can use `nix-copy-closure` to move it to another remote server.  `Nixops` a more recent offering just renamed from `charon` also allows for deterministic building of ec2 instances.",1368856301

I'm not sure why that is.  It would probably take me about 24 hours to write an MVP script that would serve a different ad dependent on platforms.  I would certainly at least try them out if they allowed targeting by platform like the major advertising networks do.

The truth is that longshoremen do have the potential to make a decent amount of money -- but in reality, only a small % of them do.<p>Pay starts off in the lower 20's and get get as high as 40-45 depending on the job you get and what shift you work; nights are 1.3 and weekends are 1.5, and some jobs have a 15% or 25% bonus. This sounds like a decent amount of $, but 3/4ths of the longshoremen work only 1 day a week on average. In 2008, we (Casuals) worked about 1 day every 4 months. I've heard of casuals making 90k in the 1990's, but I don't think that'll ever happen again.<p>Regulars, on the other hand, make a good amount of money. On average, the probably make 100k, and if you are a boss or a crane driver, close to 150k. Being a boss, regular, or crane driver takes a lot of time; especially the way things have been going with our economy lately. Before it would take maybe 15-20 years, and now, it's more like 20-30.<p>When I write this, it makes me want to give up on the job because its long term potential is dwindling. But like I mentioned, I love the culture and what it feels like working at the port; it also allows me a lot of freedom to work on my personal projects (shameless plug: I am working on a commenting platform that'll let you use audio comments). The pay right now is decent; I can earn 200-300 for working one day a week, and have the rest of the week for myself. However, getting a job for the week is sometimes annoying; I have to stand around at a hiring hall for hours - or sometimes, days - to work a shift.",1368855925

5728011,comment,5724514,5727923,2,0,raymondduke,,,"Automation is coming, without a doubt. The problem right now is implementation. A lot of the terminals have had computer screens with GPS that either don't work or are way too faulty. The terminal I worked at today ordered several new automated cranes this year (video: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdMMDjPPILE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VdMMDjPPILE</a>) but they didn't have the power to support them; so now they are digging up the pavement in order to supply more power. It's a giant mess.<p>Main improvements would be a better implementation, obviously, but also a better line of communication between companies and workers. I wrote a piece of Medium (<a href=""https://medium.com/labor-related/188796b758d"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/labor-related/188796b758d</a>) about how they hired 18,000 new workers in the late 90's; which would normally be a very good thing but 80% of those workers are still on temp status (including me). Temp status (i.e., a Casual) doesn't earn a pension, get benefits, or have any of the other perks of a regular worker. I might be getting off-topic a little here, but an improvement to the ports would include a better line of communication between workers and companies instead of trying to turn the port into a giant conveyor belt. I'm not so skeptical to think that a good paying blue collar job will exist forever, but there is an extreme level of efficiency that happens when you put human minds behind big tasks instead of leaving it up to computers.<p>Here is another panoramic pic of when I worked rails: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/V1Sficm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/V1Sficm.jpg</a>.

Ask your friends NOT to tell you what they like about your product, but rather what they don't like.  Underweight positive feedback, and overweight the negative.<p>2. Reason from first principles rather than by analogy.  It's easier to compare a situation or a problem to something similar to it and be satisfied by the analogy.

If you can do this, then you can compute answers to the same things computed by any other Turing complete language.<p>This says nothing about practicality, but nobody ever said it did.  Of course practicality is important, but a conversation about Turing completeness is a conversation about ""can compute"", not ""can easily compute"".  If you look at venues such as POPL, ESOP, and PLDI, fairly often you will find proofs for some abstract representation that is then implemented in a real world language.  Thus while it would be impractical to compute something in the abstract form, it is often more elegant for proof construction, and then proof results are transferable if you can demonstrate bisimulation between the two forms.  All this to say that ""can compute"" is nevertheless an important determination with respect to equipotency.<p>If you had an Unlambda OS (or VM is better perhaps), then anything running on it would be an Unlambda program, including C programs, just as anything running on an x86 machine is an x86 program.",1368854497

The comments for the ads are pretty negative despite the reddit history, but Hipmunk is still doing quite well.<p>I think you'll do fine with a test run advertising on reddit, if you're that worried about it I'm pretty sure you can turn comments off for ads so they won't be able to see that other people don't like them.",1368853898
