5761564,comment,5758192,5758957,3,0,pilif,,,"To add another war story: back in 2004 I was in the position of having to write software for a very, very underpowered barcode terminal running ucLinux (the intermec ck1, for those interested. Only a year later, it was discontinued (grrr) due to the EU finalizing the RoHS norm).<p>I needed to synchronize product data from our web application with that scanner in order to display useful info instead of just scanned bar codes.<p>Thankfully I found a patch for SQLite to work with the greatly reduced stack size in ucLinux (the site is still around here: <a href=""http://www.menie.org/georges/uClinux/sqlite.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.menie.org/georges/uClinux/sqlite.html</a>)<p>Now, after 9 years, one user is still holding on to their device and we're still synchronizing product data to that SQLite database. We never had crashes or data losses (even though recovery would be trivial) and ever since then, every subsequent hardware solution we were using always relied on SQLite for storage.<p>I don't even want to start thinking about how much pain it would have been to write my own database for that slow ck1 monster. Seeing SQLite run on the device in my serial terminal was butch a lt of fun and a great relief as it just saved me countless hours of work.<p>Me, I love SQLite :-)",1369378718

5761555,comment,5692975,5696169,1,0,touristtam,,,"As epiceyebags mentioned, Game Programming is way too wide as a 'field'. Check what makes a complex software such as a game and which part of a game you want to contribute to. Do some read up on Game Engine (both as a developer and as a library you can use). If you have any programming skills, you might want to check the code behind open-sourced Game Engines as well (such as the Quake Engine line).<p>From my understanding (and I could be wrong), you have roughly three (3) layers:\n- the Game Engine that contains such things as the Rendering engine, the Net Client, the Physics Engine and the Audio Engine;\n- the Game Logic where is define how the object in-game interact;\n- the media who are the images, the sound used in the game.<p>Most modders are making changes only on the Game Logic and/or the media, but find an older Game Engine open-sourced and you will find example of mods that are touching directly to the Game Engine layer.<p>All in all, if you are interested into getting into game development, and after you have acquired some understanding of the structure of a Game as a Software, you want to start creating your game (either a recreation or something totally new). And don't worry right now about not using something that will be relevant in a year, you need to put some experience under your belt, first and foremost.",1369378321

HTML which had not been fully drafted or ratified and which was only available as they saw fit in web-kit.<p>And then all the other non-Google browsers were suddenly ""slow"" on ""adopting new HTML standards"". Basically through its internet dominance, and now its browser, Google pushed through its own implementation of proprietary HTML features as standards other browsers had to implement, without any discussion, feedback or other input.<p>Google just decided that they alone should dictate how the HTML-standard is from now on.<p>After seeing that happen, I lost all belief in Google as a company which I will rely on for anything more than I strictly need to.",1369377713

Mr Obama should lend his weight to their efforts. Ideally, they would start afresh with no loopholes and much lower rates. Republicans should love this: if Congress were to scrap all loopholes and deductions, it could nearly halve income-tax rates and still raise the same amount of money. Democrats should like it, too: a more efficient tax system would let them pay for the same amount of government with less drag on growth. The snag is that voters define “loopholes” as other people’s tax breaks. Their own, they rather like. Getting rid of particular boondoggles such as the mortgage-interest deduction may prove impossible. But capping the overall amount of deductions any individual can take should not be, so long as both parties have their fingerprints on the bill, thus sharing the credit and the blame.""",1369376240
