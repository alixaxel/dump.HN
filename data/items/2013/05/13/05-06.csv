Fully need-blind admission and financial aid based ONLY on financial need.  At Ivy League schools today there are ZERO merit or athletic scholarships.  There are a few special programs that give merit-based grants for research or other special academic expenses but none that cover tuition or living costs.  Even more importantly, there are semi-rigid guidelines laid out in advance that show the correlation between family income and expected family contribution (how much you'll pay for your kid to go to school).  So if your child gets in on merit, you can reasonably predict how much you'll have to pay and in many, many cases it is a greatly reduced price.  This is a good version of the ""high tuition high aid"" system.  Best of all, all of this financial aid is no-loan and no-strings-attached free money.<p>Yes, of course elite schools will always court rich kids.  Need-blind admissions will never change this.  If your business school is named McGruberstein School of Business and Mr. McGruberstein's child applies to your school you'll probably take him.  While this chips away at the idea of a true meritocracy it does encourage many of the donations that fund the financial aid for low income students in the first place.  Yes this is ""evil"" and is certainly Not Fair, but the colleges need to court these donations in order to build facilities and provide aid at current levels.  I know that many of the elite schools spend much more on students each year than they bring in via tuition, and this is financed by the large and ever-growing endowment that they so value.",1368422484

If you want to learn something about what made GE successful, however, good luck picking out the few saplings of wisdom from the thick forest of names.\nGolf and tennis fans will also find the book fascinating for its endless catalog of golf and tennis resorts nationwide. Apparently being anywhere near the top at GE requires moving to Fairfield, Connecticut and aping the Lifestyles of the Bland and WASPy.<p>One interesting thing I learned is that GE went from 0 percent employee ownership to 31 percent during Jack Welch's tenure as CEO, primarily through granting of stock options to top managers such as Jack himself. Jack doesn't talk about this except to say that he's proud of the number. He doesn't get into the question of whether the investors from 1980 are happy now that they own less than 70 percent of the company. Nor does he talk about what would have happened to GE's earnings if they'd accounted for all of these stock options at time of issue.<p>The useful and interesting content in this book could have been presented in 75 pages if the editors and ghostwriter had been doing their jobs. But they weren't doing their jobs. So the readers all have to ""give 110 percent"" or ""give 1000 percent"".
