ML is able to infer almost all types in a program (however the algorithm requires that the language doesn't have subtyping). Haskell has very good type inference which support subtyping (you declare very few types). They both have strong static type system and don't tax developers by making them having to declare every type. Algorithms which are used in Haskell are complicated, but they can be implemented.",1369742382
5779390,comment,5779166,5779188,10,0,VLM,,,"That's a good list of 30 or so myths and a pro-systemd explanation.  It would be interesting to have an anti-systemd rebuttal.  The explanation that systemd is non-monolithic ""in design"" because each binary can be separately packaged ""in packaging phase"" was pretty lame because it confuses the topic to ""win"", although also completely irrelevant (A better answer would have been, ok, assume inductively for the sake of this discussion that it's monolithic... given that inductive assumption, so what?).<p>1) Are there any significant/serious myths not listed?<p>2) Does it matter?  What I mean by that is the systemd wars remind me a lot of the sound wars from years ago.  $user installs a sound system (alsa, pulse, oss, doesn't really matter).  It'll probably either work perfectly or miserably fail.  If it works, $user will blindly love that sound system and brag about it.  If it doesn't work, $user will trash talk it all over the internet.  The facts don't seem to matter, just the results of one anecdotal experience.  In an environment like that its nearly impossible to learn anything from the community about systemd.<p>It reminds me a lot of those geniuses who post on world wide forums how no one in the world should sign up for $cellphone_provider because their local tower has poor coverage.  That's just great, as if the other 99.9999% of the population should care.",1369742303

It includes schematics and algorithms and other technical details of the machine.  Actually, if you're old enough, you probably remember getting told in your first CompSci classes how computers were made up of I/O, a CPU and memory, which even by the 1980s seemed like a quaint way of viewing things.  Reading Colussus for the first time, you really understand why they made the distinction in the textbooks.  Just the machines to read and write to paper tape were incredibly complicated, and the speed that you could spool paper tape was a limiting factor in the early days.  Indeed the first systems didn't really have a memory system, they had to keep re-reading data from tapes.  The need to avoid that was the reason they invented memory in the first place - it sped up computer operations by orders of magnitude!<p>The book also covers in great detail how they went about <i>intercepting</i> the signals from the German High Command - which itself was a very modern digital modulation scheme that hadn't existed until them.  The work of the signals interceptors was very impressive too, and run by the British Post Office, if my memory serves correctly :D",1369739773

Due to my personal financial need since my marriage, I have once again got a corporate company working as PM/Developer with an high pay ( in Vietnam), but at the same time try to keep my business alive. It has been one year since I started working here, and even though I don't think I have done a bad job with the salary increase, but I honestly never have been enjoyed a single day of it. I am determined to quit the job and get back to my business as it has started to pick up again, we also preparing to launch a mobile product shortly.<p>All in all, I think the stories that you guys have put here is such a good inspiration for me to get back to start up world, enjoying every day of coding and hacking. Hopefully, one day my product will make to the top of hackernews.",1369739604

My aunt volunteered to go to Romania to help save as many of these kids as possible.<p>The relevant news for you is that kids who were only three at the time rescuers arrived almost all recovered without lasting harm. The thing that saved them was LOTS of daily human interaction.<p>Talk to that boy as much as you can. Hold him, sing to him (singing skill is optional), play with his hands, play ""piggies"" with his toes, work on naming parts of his face, play ""head, shoulders, knees, and toes,"" play with blocks, talk about colors, have one of you make a funny face and the other one has to copy it then switch roles, and so on. (Don't read too much into it if he's really bad at some of these games. My sons had no developmental problems, and yet I could not BELIEVE how badly they did on some simple mental games: ""See this green card, Buddy? It's green, isn't it?"" ""Yes."" ""What color is it?"" ""I don't know, Dada."" ""This color is green, okay?"" ""Okay."" ""So, what color is this GREEN card?"" ""I don't know, Dada."" Yes, believe it or not, this is totally normal.)<p>Be a little careful not to overstimulate him with too much noise, wild motion, etc., because that can be hard for him to process until he's older, but lots of calm, happy, silly, giggly talking and playing should (slowly) bring him back to the path he would have been on without the early lack of attention.<p>Also, as others have suggested, do involve doctors in this to the extent you can. There might be more to the story than lack of attention, and ""many eyes"" are better for debugging problems early, right?",1369739376
