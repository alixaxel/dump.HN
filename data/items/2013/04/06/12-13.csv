5503455,comment,5498272,5498272,2,0,jng,,,"Poor explanations such as this annoy me:<p>""By replacing the initial R with an E on the first eight registers, it is possible to access the lower 32 bits (EAX for RAX). Similarly, for RAX, RBX, RCX, and RDX, access to the lower 16 bits is possible by removing the initial R (AX for RAX), and the lower byte of the these by switching the X for L (AL for AX), and the higher byte of the low 16 bits using an H (AH for AX)""<p>It makes learning more difficult. Something like this would be way better:<p>""Specific parts of the registers can be accessed separately from the rest of the register, within strict limitations dictated by the format of instructions. These register-parts are given easy-to-remember names. The lower 32 bits of the first eight registers can be accessed as EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, EBP, ESI, EDI and ESP. The lower 16 bits of registers EAX, EBX, ECX and EDX can also be accessed as AX, BX, CX and DX. Finally, both the lower and the second-lower bytes of registers EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX can be separately accessed as AH, AL, BH, BL, CH, CL,  DH and DL, with AL/BL/CL/DL being the lowest-order byte and AH/BH/CH/DH being the other one.<p>Knowing what things are due to what part of the model, and what parts are conventions, is a big part of understanding, which is just building a good model of the architecture in your mind.<p>It took me years to understand two's complement arithmetic, and the key missing point was that it is just a convention. A convention with great practical advantages, but a convention anyway.",1365253150

5503436,comment,5501394,5503268,2,0,davidjohnstone,,,"There are a lot of dead Bitcoins around. This thread [1] documents about 70,000 lost Bitcoins, and you can be sure there's a lot more.<p>The other way to lose Bitcoins, apart from losing a wallet or forgetting its password, is to make a transaction to a bad address (as in, a valid-according-to-the-protocol address that isn't anybodies).<p>If I understand how it works correctly, you wouldn't fake ownership of a wallet per se; you would need to come up with private keys to match the public keys of the transactions that belong to that wallet, which I believe is equivalent to breaking SHA256. That would be unexpected. Also, there's no way to tell if a wallet is dead or just not in use (that is, all you can know is that there are transactions that have not been spent yet, and if the same address is used to receive multiple transactions you have additional information that indicates the wallet is not in use but it can never indicate that it's dead).<p>If you managed to claim ownership of a dead wallet, there's nothing at all stopping you from claiming ownership of an in-use wallet too. But SHA256 is looking pretty secure right now.<p>As for the way Bitcoins will inevitably be lost over time, it's generally considered in the Bitcoin community [2][3] that there's nothing to worry about (it will just add a bit more deflationary pressure). I don't like this aspect of the currency  money disappearing into the void with no hope to correct for mistakes might make it perfect for computers, but it's not so good for humans.<p>As for tracking stolen Bitcoins, if the transaction hashes of the thefts were made public, an exchange should be able to tell if the Bitcoins that somebody is trying to turn into real money were once stolen. This is because the blockchain contains the entire history of Bitcoins  the way Bitcoins are spent is by taking the Bitcoins from a previous transaction and making a new transaction based on them; all this information is stored in the blockchain[4]. Some work has been done[5][6] at looking at what can be discovered by looking at the blockchain  it's not nearly as anonymous as many think it is.<p>1. <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7253.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=7253.0</a><p>2. <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Lost_coins_can.27t_be_replaced_and_this_is_bad"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths#Lost_coins_can.27t_be_repla...</a><p>3. <a href=""https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=109117.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=109117.0</a><p>4. <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transactions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transactions</a><p>5. <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4524.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.4524.pdf</a><p>6. <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/584.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/584.pdf</a>",1365252820

The Wikimedia Foundation's legal team was contacted by Direction Centrale du Renseignement Intrieur in early March regarding the French language Wikipedia article entitled ""La station hertzienne militaire de Pierre sur Haute"". The Direction Centrale du Renseignement Intrieur requested that we delete the article in its entirety under the claim that it contained classified military information. I responded to Direction Centrale du Renseignement Intrieur, requesting more detailed information because it was not apparent what classified information the article could possibly contain from a plain reading of the article. The Direction Centrale du Renseignement Intrieur repeatedly failed to provide any further information and simply continued to make a general takedown demand, despite my explanation that we could not remove the information without more information from them. Eventually, I had no choice but to refuse their request until they are willing to provide me with more information so that I can properly evaluate their claim under legal standards. The community remains free, of course, to retain or remove the article as it sees fit. But at this point, we do not see a demonstrated reason to remove it on legal grounds. --Michelle Paulson, Legal Counsel (WMF)<p>And this is ""Remi""'s first post about the whole thing (rough translation and report):<p>> Bonjour,<p>> je vous informe que l'article Station hertzienne militaire de Pierre sur Haute vient d'tre supprim par mes soins.

They have a simple workflow in place already, but I think there must be ways to make it more efficient and improve it. Specifically, I wanted to enquire about whether or not it added value to increase the level of ""ownership"" in the development process. The way i was considering implementing this was:<p>* dev pushes to git server<p>* post-receive hook kicks off CI server<p>* if everything works, CI deploys commit to production.<p>This seems risky, so I'm assuming if people are doing this, they add steps similar to these:<p>* do a rolling deploy<p>* if error rate increases on instances with new release, rollback and alert dev team / owner of commit<p>The problem is, we're relatively small at this point so the last two steps may not be feasible for us. Is this something that only works in larger, more modular organizations? In general, what are the trade offs for using things like CI and this kind of ownership in a development team?

If the consequences of the function screwing up is a slight UI aberration ... well I barely test UI code at all, really. MVC for the app MC for the tests). Also there's pieces of code where I know they're potentially not thread safe and so, just to make sure big screwups get caught, I test firing off the same test 1000x in parallel.
