Within a couple of weeks we made our first algorithmic change, and made several quick fix releases to update the scoring methods in the following weeks. By the end of the month, a whole section of our testing suite was almost completely worthless. In a world where cash is king, I wouldn’t mind having those dollars back.""<p>What I don't understand about comments like this is that a whole section of your code, <i>both</i> runtime / deliverable code and test code had become worthless.  But, you only seem to view the discarded test code as wasted effort.  Either the tests have value or they don't.  And, if you write tests, and then discard the code they test, you'll likely also discard the tests.  But, that doesn't change whether or not the tests had value, nor whether the new tests that you'll write for the new code have value.",1366070391

Aren't existing dictionaries essentially the ""canon""?<p>No, because that isn't how dictionaries work. Dictionaries, and this goes back to the very first dictionaries, have always paid people to look at current usage and write definitions based on that. Dictionaries are <i>descriptive</i>, not <i>prescriptive</i>; they reflect usage, not control it.<p>The <i>OED</i> is well-known for its citations backing up its definitions, and they have a very strong bias towards actual usage as opposed to other dictionaries.<p>Edited to add: <i>Some</i> dictionaries are prescriptive to an extent. Those are the ones that define terms used in a controlled vocabulary, such as technical terms used in a specific field. When the CRC handbook says that <i>this</i> is what 'butyl' means, for example, it is pretty well taken to be prescriptive among chemists.",1366070015

We’re seeing the first few devices come off the production line right now.<p>We know you’ve been standing by patiently to get Glass. So, instead of waiting for all of the devices to be ready, we want to start delivering them to you now. We’re producing enough for everyone, but only a portion of them are ready today. Therefore, we’ll be notifying you in waves, and as soon as we’re ready to invite you, we’ll let you know. When the time comes, you’ll receive an email with all the details.<p>Thanks for believing in us from the start.

Once you spend some time in Detroit, you understand why it's called MotorCity, it's highly pedestrian unfriendly and I wouldn't trust the public transportation system unless I'm willing to risk my safety.<p>The other challenge is that there are towns/areas around Detroit that seem to be better fit for building a new tech/startup hub when compared to Downtown Detroit when it comes to quality of life, pedestrian-oriented, and safety:<p>- Corktown - closest thing to the Mission, this area has an edgy industrial loft type of gentrification going on with a lot of young hip folks. This area is right on the edge of downtown but you go a few blocks away to look for housing and you encounter 50% burned down or houses in disrepair which means you can't really walk around the area feeling safe once it gets dark. I wouldn't walk there in the daytime given how few people are in that area and the number of abandoned properties.<p>- Royal Oak - town about 11 miles North of Detroit. It's like the Marina district, lots of trendy hip shops, safe to walk around, good quality housing and vegan food options as well as good cultural scene. This area has the shops and lifestyle that Downtown is lacking.<p>- Birmingham - further north in the suburbs, Google and McCann are located in this wealthy suburb. Features good food, high end shopping, a small upscale town feel (like Pacific Heights). Safe to walk around, good quality parks nearby, working and functioning government.<p>I like the motto and energy of Detroit that comes across in the form of ""Detroit Hustles Harder"" but I think you gotta address the core issue of having a city that people can feel safe in. I grew up in a poor neighborhood of LA and have never felt as unsafe as I feel driving around the large swaths of Detroit that have been left to rot.",1366069296

My conclusion wasn't drawn from an isolated incident; I shared the incident to highlight what I imagine is a common pitfall in testing.<p>I used the phrase ""only test what needs to be tested"" intentionally.  How should I know what you need to test?  But if you accept that you should only test what needs to be tested, then there is an implication that some (I'd venture to say most) of what you write doesn't need to be tested.  And that's a liberating concept.  You aren't obligated to test everything, but you should test what really matters.<p>What needs to be tested is probably directly related to the size and stability of the company (assuming size and stability have a positive correlation).  I would venture to surmise that young start-ups have almost no need to test anything.  That comment isn't meant to be inflammatory, but I look at testing too early like optimizing too early.  There's no reason to shard a database until you absolutely have to, and I don't think you need to test something until you know it's mission critical.<p>For example, Stripe offers a service that were components of it to fail would jeopardize their entire business.  Their code base is obligated, by its nature, to have more stringent tests.  But the startup in the garage next to yours who is still trying to determine MVP and will probably end up pivoting five times in the next two weeks?  Save yourself a lot of grief and don't worry about the tests.  Once you know what you are going to be, once you know what you can't afford to lose, well, wrap those portions up with some solid tests.",1366068762

Typically one writes a mocked up service that returns the expected results, pass it in somehow, and write your tests like you did above. So if you have a lot of services, you end up doing what I said - testing lines of code. Here you're testing that FooService gets called. If it also called BarService, you'd be testing that BarService gets called. And so on.<p>But then later, we decide that FooService is no good - we want, nay demand - a FooService2, with a new API. However, get_foo is to behave the same. So what now? Only one choice - update all of the tests to have a mocked up FooService2.<p>As the code base grows, I find this becomes annoying to maintain (although to some extent a necessary evil, of course).<p>The alternative I'm saying is that instead of spending a ton of energy unit testing get_foo, hammer on it and write good state validators. Your unit test shows that get_foo for bar = 12 returns a unit_price of 97.12. Great, but I don't think that's as interesting as building a fake database (so we know what the expected returns are), and then making 50,000 requests per second with random data for 12 hours, and then through runtime assertions and as a post-process validating that the service actually did what it was supposed to.",1366068592

In my opinion, this is something that comes with experience and is more of an art than a science.  But I'm okay with that.<p>If all you got out of the article was that slavishly following a process (like TDD) can be bad, I'll consider that a win for my writing.  Because my general feel of the community is that testing is some sacrosanct practice that must be adhered to without question.  And I question that.<p>I write tests.  I'm not anti-test.  I just imagine I write far fewer tests than most.  In my opinion we should constantly question whether a certain practice (in this case, writing a specific test) is worth it.

I built Tarsnap because I want the world to have good, secure, online backups; it's a profitable corporation simply because that's the most natural form for a backup service to take.<p>Leaving Tarsnap out of the picture -- supposing I was working at a startup instead of being the sole founder of a startup -- hiring me would involve:<p>1. Having a technical employee (or possibly a formerly-technical employee who has moved into management) approach me.  Even the best recruiters have enough cultural mismatch with me that they utterly fail to get my attention.  Rough ballpark: If I say ""use the address in my whois"" and you manage to contact me, you pass that test.<p>2. Telling what you're doing -- on the ground.  I don't care about your elevator pitch, and aside from being satisfied that you can pay your bills, I don't care how profitable the company is going to be -- I'm never going to work somewhere in the hopes of getting a big IPO payout.<p>3. Telling me what you would want me to work on.  Give specific examples of technical problems.  I'm never going to move to a different city based on ""we're doing lots of exciting things and we're sure you'll enjoy working here"".<p>And if you're really serious:<p>4. Flying me down, renting me a hotel room, and giving me a desk in your offices for a week.  Don't pay me, and don't assign me work to do; just tell people that I'm there.  By the end of the week, one of two things will have happened: Either I'll have spent most of the week working on my own stuff, and won't be interested in working for you, or I'll have been talking to people and solving problems and writing code and I'll be excited about joining your team.",1366067544
