5580826,comment,5576999,5579186,1,0,mprovost,,,"The specialised chips that are used by routers are CAMs and TCAMs. Basically, associative arrays (hashes or dictionaries as they're called in most scripting languages) implemented in hardware. You can program an FPGA to run as a CAM. Mostly what they're doing are repeated lookups of where to switch or route packets (based on header fields). If you're in a CPU world with RAM you can try and optimise the data structure that holds the lookup tables so you get decent speed but with CAM it's implemented in hardware so the lookup times are fixed and known. It's not really a limit of computation that can be helped with multiple cores, the CPUs can be pretty slow. Multithreading or parallel processing is typically handled on routers by distributing the workload to packet processors that handle a single port or a group of ports, all looking at the same CAM (or copies of it in the more distributed chassis-based architectures). Modern routers are basically supercomputers in a box. Of course there's an inherent limit at the PHY level where you can only receive or transmit a single packet at a time on an interface so you can't multiprocess beyond a CPU per port basically which limits the complexity of the design. 1000 cores on a GPU won't help you if you only have 100 ports to route traffic on.<p>On a typical Intel PC, the MMU's TLB is implemented in CAM as well but it's tiny in comparison to the ones in routers. CAMs are pretty power hungry compared to RAM. They are becoming commodities though and the router manufacturers are getting away from doing custom ASIC designs. Intel bought Fulcrum which makes these packet processors and companies like Big Switch are doing cool stuff with white box network hardware. It's really going to bring the cost of the hardware down pretty dramatically in the next couple years.",1366448144

I switched it to free and it took off.  Everyone at my kid's school got it and they let others know.  Through analytics I can see it is being used for long periods of time by many kids every day.  Tried the teaching approach with kids with mild learning disabilities and it made a difference in a number of cases.<p>All of that is good, however the problem is that in order to be able to justify completing the series I have to show revenue.  Placing ads in apps for 3~5 year old kids is not an option.  One thought was to place ads in screens off the main game (Settings, etc.) to at least capture a minor revenue stream.  I have that build but haven't released it yet.<p>The problem with the expectation of everything being free is what it does to the ability to innovate and explore.  Apps don't cost zero to develop.  As much as it hurts me to think it, I am not sure I can justify attempting to innovate at the early education market because there's virtually no money in it for the vast majority of developers.  Even paying for logo and graphic design is impossible when your revenue is zero or near zero.<p>For me at least there seems to be far more traction and revenue in the specialized utilities segment.<p>On the other hand, it is hard to pay the iOS software world attention when we can charge $250 to $350 per hour for mechanical, electronics hardware and software development in certain verticals.",1366447711

Instead I'm going to tell you what I've learned, as I was in a similar situation 9 years ago, though whether my lot has been improved much through experience is probably open to debate.<p>I was diagnosed with ADD when I was 8, though I've come to feel that the broad range of symptoms that the label is applied is less of a binary trait and more of a spectrum of behavioral characteristics that everyone can relate to, some more than others. If you feel like you have it, you probably do, though getting the official seal of ""ADD"" is probably only useful in that it gives you a venue to legally obtain medication to help mitigate it, as I did; working my way through the pharmacopoeia until I eventually settled into a grudging partnership with Adderall, which I took throughout high school. And it WAS very useful for extended periods of focus and crunching before tests and exams.<p>The one catch: I absolutely hated it. It made me feel disconnected, gave me a serious case of cottonmouth, gave me some serious bad breath, and made it nearly impossible to maintain a healthy sleep habit and diet. It's not something I would recommend except as an absolute last resort.<p>College can be a cruel first test of one's ability to balance their commitments. Personally I found the barrage of new things I had to deal with on my own for the first time overwhelming, and didn't last long at my first institution (UIUC). At the same time, I can say that many of my obstacles were things I chose. Making friends, going to parties, getting involved with student groups, and social activities were all things that I chose over applying myself towards my coursework. And here's the thing: <i>I learned a lot!</i> But not about the things I was being tested on.<p>I don't want to ramble on with obsessive detail, but I will say that I finally graduated 9 1/2 years after enrolling in 2003, though much of that time was spent not in school. Here's what would have saved my parents and I a lot of money: As soon as my interest waned, I should have taken time off. I didn't because of family pressure. There's a poignant quote somewhere about not playing if your head's not in the game, I'm sure, and I wish I had taken heed.<p>The thing is, all the time spent partying, travelling, working crappy minimum wage jobs, and living outside of the the very small world that concerns itself with minute improvements to the travelling salesman problem, and whether P = NP, gave me a perspective that has finally motivated me to pursue a self-driven education on computer-science-related topics that I never had until <i>my very last semester</i> of college (which was Fall 2012). Do I regret it? Sure, there are loads of things I'd do differently, but through the whole process I've developed extracurricular skills I value and am generally much happier and fulfilled person than I would have been if I had graduated in 2008.<p>So what I'm getting at in what I've realized is an extremely roundabout way, is that if you don't feel like you're really ready to dive into what you're learning headfirst, if you don't feel COMPELLED to... then don't. Take some time off and do something else that you want. Consider another major or career path. Learn to play an instrument. Heck, join a circus troupe. If you think your CS curriculum is tough now, just wait until your junior and senior years. That's when the difficulty really starts to adopt a tune that has the palatability of nails-on-a-chalkboard.<p>Because of pressure from my parents mainly, I kept going back when I <i>knew with all the fabric of my essence that I wasn't ready</i> and trying to half-ass my way through my classes. And I kept getting chewed up and spat out so to speak by the difficulty of the material. Seriously, I ended up failing core computer science classes repeatedly because my head wasn't in the game, because I didn't understand why the concepts I was learning were important, or applicable to anything I was interested in doing at the time, and because I truly just wasn't ready. It's like trying to bike up a steep hill without enough forward momentum. You need to be in high gear and ready to bring it.<p>So what finally got me interested in learning the material? I've always been fairly certain that I want to build things with code. I considered everything from music to writing to psychology in throes of self-doubt, but what it came down to in the end was that nothing excites me the way computer technology does, which fortuitously enough happened to be my intended major from the get-go. But I had to learn a lot about everything else the other academic disciplines, and life in general, had to offer before I was comfortable making that decision.<p>TL;DR, as promised:<p>-Unless you want to medicate yourself (which may be unhealthy in the long run), you may have to put higher ed on hold until you're feeling it (I should have).<p>-The degree isn't as important as the knowledge. Motivate yourself to learn things that you're interested in for now. As your base of knowledge grows, you may find that more and more of your interests overlap with a computer science curriculum. In that case, go for the degree again. If not, consider majoring in or studying something else.<p>-Consider taking some time off from any kind of classical academic learning and instead use this time for other personal and emotional growth and self-discovery. Work and support yourself, if you're not already. Go on an enormous road trip. Spend some time volunteering for a cause that resonates with you.<p>-If you do decide to continue with school full-time, then do whatever you can to make it your only commitment. Tell the band they have to find a new drummer. Tell your best friend to find a new wingman. <i>Move in with your parents if possible or get whatever financial aid you can so that you don't have to work while you're in school</i>. Seriously, with this last one. It sounds lame, but if it may be the only thing that can get you through your junior and senior years of CS.",1366446327

In recognizing our own weaknesses, we could sympathize with others' weaknesses even though they are different from yours. Also most importantly we should not let our own weaknesses stop us from achieving our dreams..Weaknesses are just something we have to overcome in life. Seeking help, from professionals or from friends, is a way of finding out how we could overcome weaknesses. In short I think the most important thing is to recognize one's weaknesses and be motivated in trying to find ways to overcome them.",1366446209

When we got started, we ran an initial randomized controlled trial[1] which showed our cognitive training program improved memory, then ran a larger study[2], and then ran the largest study that had ever been done with commercially available brain training program[3].<p>Problems obvious to a scientist:<p>1. Poor controls. Both the experimental subjects and the researchers know, or can easily establish, which are experimental subjects and which are controls. A built-in bias.<p>2. The study was conducted by the company that stood to benefit from a positive result. An obvious procedural flaw.<p>3. Inadequate precautions against counting a placebo effect (an imaginary benefit) or Hawthorne effect (any attention paid to the subjects improves their state) as a meaningful outcomes correlated with the specific treatment rather then any treatment.<p>But I am sure you already know this -- it presents the usual litany of legitimate objections to this kind of study.<p>> Different cognitive training programs are different - just like different anti-cancer molecules are different. Some are going to work, and some aren't.<p>That's true but irrelevant. The only meaningful question is which methods work <i>in principle</i>. There are no methods that consistently work, and no one can <i>explain</i> the outcomes, only <i>describe</i> them. Which means it's not science.",1366446122
