The USD hasn't dropped in value by 50% in the last two years.<p>Most of currency is fluctuation is fluctuation <i>relative to other currencies</i>. If the price of the Icelandic krona plummets relative to USD and GBP, it doesn't mean that all the prices in Iceland immediately rise to compensate. People in Iceland are still paid in krona and buy things in krona for approximately the same number of krona.<p>But if the price of BTC rises suddenly, prices <i>do</i> suddenly decrease because at the moment it's just a proxy. There's no real internal market: there aren't people who are paid in BTC and have their savings account in BTC and make their mortgage payments in BTC and buy their food in BTC.<p>So BTC really isn't like other currencies. It's fluctuating massively <i>even from an internal market perspective</i>.",1364893173

Cloud and security engineers
- a few years successfully scaling systems
- experience with scala
- experience moving legacy code over to new platforms
- especially experience with legacy cobol and ada
- occasional travel to an East Oregon data center might be required
- you don't need all of these... but we really would like you to be willing to learn deal with cobol<p>Rails and scala interns with the possibility of further work
- experience setting up new websites
- setting up the customer interfaces, backend processing (can you do simple analytics?)
- make our website pretty looking
- be willing to learn how to scale things
- very familiar with Linux systems but be able to talk to clients who range from fellow engineers to people who think their OS is called HP.<p>We offer a competitive salary, paid time off, 401K and medical benefits for both. Internships, and we use that word lightly, can last over the summer to 6 months (COOP)<p>Email me at renardwilliams42 \at\ gmail.com.

5478315,comment,5477405,5477733,5,0,zeteo,,,"I don't even think CEOs are paid for their contacts. If you look at the number of CEOs who jump to unrelated industries, it's doubtful many of their contacts carry along. Also if contacts were so paramount, sales people would have an almost insuperable advantage - it is their job to fatten their rolodex everyday; whereas people from other departments can and often do become CEO.<p>I've been reading a lot of Thorstein Veblen lately, who is very thought provoking; and I think what he would say (not that I completely agree, but it's an interesting viewpoint) is that CEOs are paid to be the right social class. The board of directors prefer to rub shoulders with someone they can easily relate to; a person who, say, plays a decent game of golf and can casually discuss the market for mansions as well as the features of the latest model Porsche. (Let's be serious, all else being equal we all prefer interacting with someone who shares our interests.) So they are willing to sacrifice 0.1% of the company's bottom line in return for smoother interaction with the person who will, in effect, be their main point of contact. People who already earn a lot of money (and would, of course, not switch for a decreased salary) thus have a big advantage when interviewing for the chief position. In fact, if nobody in the company is already living a sufficiently wealthy lifestyle, this model would suggest it's more likely for an outsider to be brought in (upon, say, acquisition).",1364893019

5478225,comment,5473128,5474526,10,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"Why is deflation bad?<p>Let's look at a single-currency country first. Prices fall. Including wages. Credit is tight - money appreciates without being invested and borrowers have to repay debts in more expensive currency tomorrow, making them more likely to default [Fisher]. People with money benefit - the rich get richer and the banks hoard capital, refusing to make loans. Inflation fuels asset bubbles as the economy over-invests; deflation fuels the opposite as the economy starves itself.<p>Yes, we have seen deflation. The U.S. and U.K. both experienced crippling deflation in the 1930s [1]. Before that, remember the American populist movement's ""Cross of Gold"" speech [2]? That wasn't a reaction to an inflationary gold standard. The euro zone offers a more contemporary view of the effects of deflation, as does my Switzerland [3].<p>Uncertainty in the future path of deflation that is more toxic than deflation <i>per se</i>. The U.S. grew through the Great Deflation in the 1870s and Japan has had mixed real effects from its almost two decade deflation [Morana]. Theoretically, if deflation proceeded at a steady clip, markets could accommodate (Milton Friedman advocated for an economy deflating at the real interest rate [Friedman]).<p>But what if we have two currencies, e.g. U.S. dollars and Bitcoin? Argentinians have a choice between black market (or ""blue"") dollars and an available but inflating peso. Tellingly, Argentinians buy dollars primarily for overseas vacations [4]. This is an example of a bad currency (the peso) and a good (the greenback). The Argentinians still execute the bulk of their transactions in pesos, not dollars.<p>Deflation is not likely to be Bitcoin's death knell, but rather a ceiling on its usage. A deflating Bitcoin will crimp transaction demand for the currency as spenders shift preference to more easily borrowed and spent dollars. Sellers would respond in kind (or, alternatively, sellers who respond in kind would gain market share).<p>Caveat: if Bitcoins are treated as a financial asset, for speculating versus spending. If so, deflation would proceed un-checked, with speculators driving out the transaction value of the currency. That said, gold has survived both deflation and speculation, so this isn't a fatal blow either.<p>[Fisher] <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/i332559"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/i332559</a> <i>The Debt Deflation Theory of Great Depressions (1933)</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0143116800/ref=redir_mdp_mobile/178-3104233-1254858"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0143116800/ref=redir_mdp_mobil...</a> <i>See Norman Montagu; British depression</i><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Gold_speech"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_of_Gold_speech</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1c23c088-60c3-11de-aa12-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2PIBbW6hp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1c23c088-60c3-11de-aa12-00144...</a> <i>Swiss central bank moves to weaken franc (June 2009)</i><p>[Morana] <a href=""http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2004/Morana29-04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2004/Morana29-04.pdf</a> <i>(2004)</i><p>[Friedman] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1412804779/ref=redir_mdp_mobile"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/1412804779/ref=redir_mdp_mobil...</a> <i>The Optimum Quantity of Money (1969)</i><p>[4] <a href=""http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/01/17/argentinas-blue-dollar-blues/#axzz2PI6FE7Uo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2013/01/17/argentinas-blue-...</a> <i>Argentinas blue dollar blues (January 2013)</i>",1364890575
