5583530,comment,5574589,5580375,1,0,bytefactory,,,"My impression was that Eric tried (successfully), to keep Google completely out of the picture, while only talking about issues from a personal perspective. A lot of the technical challenges JA mentioned would arguably be trivial for Google to solve, or attempt to solve (creating a name-hash network tree architecture like the one JA mentioned he'd liked to have seen become popular).<p>The problem I think is two-fold: 1. Google aligning with Wikileaks/JA will be seen as a political landmine for Google, since Wikileaks' agenda is very much at odds with many governments. This would obviously be something Google will have little interest in pursuing.<p>2. It's not in Google's best interest to propagate anonymity (as of now). Google's core revenue model derives from its ability to track people on the Internet. Making it easier for them to don anonymity will undermine and possibly destroy this model.<p>Whether Google's/Eric Schmidt's ultimate goals are good or evil is anybody's guess, and I don't think I gained any new insights into it based on this interview. It does appear that Eric/Google do have an interest in seeing freer access to information, as evidenced by them pushing for faster Internet, more secure/private browsing (https, 2-factor authentication, fighting official requests for access to user accounts [2]), access to the Internet in North Korea, etc. The more people are on the Internet, and the more they browse, the greater Google's revenues.<p>Google's upper management have also allegedly (and secretly) played a part in the Arab springs, which I would hazard a guess was a altruistic move, rather than a purely political one, but that's speculation [1].<p>Oh, and BTW, the timing of this 'leak' a few days before Eric Schmidt's book is highly suspect, no? :)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://thepassionateattachment.com/2012/03/23/stratforleaks-confirm-jared-cohens-involvement-in-arab-spring/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thepassionateattachment.com/2012/03/23/stratforleaks-...</a>\n(sorry this is not the best source, but Googling around will get you the actual Wikileaks cables and analysis)<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2259557/google-fights-us-government-requests-for-private-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2259557/google-figh...</a><p>Edit: formatting",1366508752

Also, the foreign policy (need to justify this hyperconsumptive lifestyle in which people eat 3x as much meat and do 2x as much driving as makes sense) has been horrid, to the point that even most Americans don't support it.<p>Cosmopolitan America is driven by a generation of people who see themselves as <i>global</i> citizens and want to improve the rest of the world through organic, democratic, and compassionate means (no more ""bomb 'em till they love us""). Also, it seeks to allow more people to have involvement in production. It turns out to be a very unrewarding existence to be a corporate drone whose only real contribution to life is to consume (especially as those pointless, menial jobs get cut, thanks to technology).<p>What we're seeing now is the conflict between Consumer vs. Cosmopolitan America.",1366508670

If they had tried to impose some sort of lockdown on Monday after the bombing, you might have a point. But they didn't. The city kept operating normally until the suspects resurfaced, got into a shootout with police, and one of them managed to evade his pursuers. Given how many people were affected by the original terrorist incident, I don't find it odd at all that most people chose to facilitate the manhunt by leaving the streets empty.",1366508556

It was an overreaction.<p>Now that I think about it, we are really good at overreacting to terrorism. A bunch of guys rammed planes into the Twin Towers and our response was to invade two countries. Some guy hid a bomb in his shoes and our response was to make tens of millions of people take off their shoes every time they are at the airport.

Since ownership of property, and construction of buildings on it, is generally registered with a government, there is a lot of data in existence, and most of it is public record. Alas, much of it is on paper, and possibly scattered among offices (the property deed in one place, construction-code approvals in another place, etc.).<p>Some governments have digitized their property registers, though. The most comprehensive one I've found is in Denmark, which has made the property register for the whole country searchable/browsable: <a href=""http://www.ois.dk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ois.dk</a><p>Example: select ""Kbenhavns Kommune"" from the dropdown box at top-right, type ""Vesterbrogade"" in the box labeled ""Vejnavn"", then click ""Sg"". You'll get a list of all buildings with street addresses on Vesterbrogade, one of the thoroughfares in Copenhagen. If you click on an individual address, you'll get information about the building and a listing of any subunits, e.g. that there are 5 floors, with 2 units on the 1st floor, 1 on the 2nd, etc. Click on any individual unit and you'll get information on everything from number of rooms, to when it was most recently renovated, to what materials are used in the construction.<p>In the U.S., some cities and counties are starting to provide at least some of this kind of information.
