In addition to that a large portion of the people I've met here come from fabulously wealthy backgrounds (dynasty money) where failure is largely irrelevant because there is always a near infinite supply of backup money.<p>I think part of the reason the valley does well is because the population is some of the most homogenous and highly selected in the world all living in the same place and there is enough wealth to try things.",1366516790

So, less than 1 in 10 people hospitalized ended up loosing a limb, but I know there was a lot of talk about shrapnel taking ""chunks"" out of people's legs. Many of the victims may suffer permanent disabilities. One guy lost an eye.<p>I used to assume that when I heard injury reports after an accident that I could safely round down to a smaller number of 'truly serious' injuries. But I haven't able to think about it the same way after reading an interview with a guy who does forensics in suicide bomber cases. He said something along the lines of ""You hear '15 injured', and you think they probably needed stitches or something. But for most of them, 'injured' really means 'fucked for life'""",1366516690

Think of the interaction model of different components in a specific tier of a technology stack (or even across tiers): You're showing the origin of a request, how it gets processed and passed on by a cluster of services that may conform to different architectures/design principles; the diagrams would help a user express parallel processing, asynchronously sending back messages/data, pubsub patterns, latency at each hop, and pretty much most things that could really speed up the distribution and understanding of system-architecture design. A basic animation would be the directional movement of an arrow/beam from service to service. A more elaborate one could be the shading of an entire component in a pulsating color suggesting a specific architecture/design-pattern.<p>Can we vary the speed of the ""beams/arrows""? Sure. ""Are we trying to ultimately generate a GIF image that can be circulated thus obviating excessive meetings?"" Indeed. ""Maybe create an applet that let's you tweak speed and other variables, and simultaneously generate the diagram in real time. THEN you export it to .GIF"" That's definitely one way of doing it. ""What's the level of abstraction presented here? Are we talking about large system components, or something like design principles that could be influenced by a programming language's runtime environment""?

Maybe 6-7+ years ago I attempted to make multiple purchases through dell.com over several months. All 3 were killed because the website listed the wrong price. I remember once I bought something like a USB drive for $47.99 and the real price was suppose to be $49.99. None of the purchases were near 20% off much less 90% in this case. I've still never ordered from Dell and never will.",1366514203

You're right<p>The grievances that drive terrorism are well understood. But beyond that I'm making confident assumptions that, on examination, I can't back up with any solid evidence or experience. I guess this is a case of ""more research is needed"".<p>> As for simply giving the event attention, I don't think there's any way around that.<p>You're right, of course, but I'll continue to rant about it.<p>If traffic accidents received anything like the attention that terrorism did -- if videos of fatal car crashes were replayed ad nauseum on the nightly news -- maybe some of those 4 people I mentioned above might still be alive today.",1366514028

They are worthless, because one day it could be me, or you.<p>Are you really prepared to give up your rights if law enforcements believes you threaten the rights of others? Would you accept it if you could not challenge that? Really? I bet you just assume it only happens to other people.<p>Lastly, this notion of every one getting their human rights simultaneously is absurd. As I said, they are only required when things go wrong or are difficult for a public to be reasonable and fair. I don't need my right to not be blown up while a police officer is observing Miranda rights, for example.
