In general the shootout gives a quite realistic results (not to mention that anybody who thinks he can do better can go code his own solution).  Programs are programs. In my own tests with larger programs Go has been 1/2 the time of Python and slower than Java too. If you're not IO bound, those things matter. If you are IO bound, you could as well run Python, since you aren't missing much.<p>Startup time doesn't matter at all except if you do scripting or old-style CGI. Java (and Go for that matter) target long running network servers and such.<p>><i>Go also gives you more control over how your program uses memory.</i><p>On the other hand Java gives most control to the JVM, which is smarter than most programmer's fine tuning and knows a whole lot more about the code's runtime behavior.",1365493979

Certainly much harder than working at places like Google or Apple - mainly because the market forces are against you. You're working with low margins, high capex, deteriorating infrastructure, deflated brands, legacy technology and a legacy customer base. To top it off, the shear momentum of companies this large (at SHLD we had 300,000 employees) is alone hard to grapple with even if you didn't have market forces against you.

Then they have a nightmare and when they wake up they are babbling.<p>The additional anti-pattern-badness with sync-in-the-app is that that kind of sync is usually incompatible with another app's bespoke sync.  But when sync is in the infrastructure then a much larger group of people who use that infrastructure can share data <i>across</i> apps if they want to without having necessarily to share a schema.  \nThis is the real power of making sync part of the underlying computing fabric.<p>Finally when this infrastructure is open source the real -danger of lock-in such as when you use Dropbox is mitigated, should you want to have that freedom.<p>Cheers.",1365492962

Pushing people towards using more formal methods to generate and accept protocols is always good.<p>That said, I thought the argument against length fields was somewhat.. weak.  But maybe I'm misunderstanding the context.  The question at the end was not answered satisfactorily. A protocol with a length field is most certainly deterministic, and if you go the other way and use a delimiter, escaping/encoding is the only way you're going to work with arbitrary user data.  I would argue the length field is miles better.  If someone injects bytes into your stream that match the protocol, your recognizer isn't going to save you, just the same way someone rewriting the length field is going to blow up.<p>What this talk seems to argue for is making the language simpler (e.g. context-free), so you can validate that the semantics are working as intended, but transferring arbitrary blobs of data is always going to be an issue as long as people enter random musings in text boxes that are rendered by Turing complete software. :-)",1365491291

I released something exactly like it a few years ago, hookbox (MIT licensed): <a href=""https://github.com/hookbox/hookbox/blob/master/docs/source/intro.rst"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hookbox/hookbox/blob/master/docs/source/i...</a><p>Basic idea is this: You put all your real-time stuff in a message queue (MQ) which communicates directly with the browser. For authentication / authorization and various other forms of permission / logging, you have the MQ communicate with the web framework via http callbacks (Webhooks) and a standard REST API. So the architecture is:<p>User <--Websocket--> MQ :: publish/subscribe<p>MQ --Webhooks--> PHP/Django/Servlets/etc. :: user signed on, user joined a channel, etc.<p>PHP --REST--> MQ  :: publish(msg), remove(user, channel), etc.<p>The key is to include cookie information in the callbacks from MQ -> PHP so the callback happens in the context of the user session. Suddenly you can do things like write a chat app in 30 lines of php + js, or a persistent time series in 20, and it really feels magical.<p>I actually started Hookbox almost as a statement of irony, because I was really frustrated about the major pushback I was getting to sockets in web browsers at the time. I'd just finished writing/submitting the initial proposal for Websocket, and I wrote this tongue-incheeck piece about the mismatch between typical web development and network server programming: <a href=""http://svwebbuilder.wordpress.com/2008/10/20/html5-websocket-and-webjneering/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svwebbuilder.wordpress.com/2008/10/20/html5-websocket...</a><p>So Hookbox started as a 2-3 day project that took on a life of its own for a while and ended up being really useful. This project was one of my smaller open source codebases and to this day I receive tons of interest and requests for maintenance, though I've abandoned it for years due to time.<p>I'm sure there's a huge market for this sort of thing.
