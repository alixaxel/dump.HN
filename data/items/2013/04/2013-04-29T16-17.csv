As a developer living and working in the U.S. I'd certainly <i>love it</i> if legislative conditions forced the above companies to hire people like me at a few hundred thousand a year more than my current salary.<p>The interesting question to me is whether or not there's a valid reason to suppress permanent immigration (not the revolving-door bodyshop kind) of talented developers who would effectively drive down demand for my services.  Again, I'd love to see my salary double or triple overnight thanks to favorable legislation, but I don't know that I have a good economic or moral case for that preference.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=net+income+per+employee+for+google%2C+for+facebook%2C+and+for+apple"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=net+income+per+employee...</a>",1367254762

5627329,comment,5626572,5627226,4,0,mjmahone17,,,"The issue with the H1-B is that those workers are then close to trapped in a specific company at specific terms. It would almost certainly be better to allow employers to sponsor immigrants for a green card, or a 6-year residency card or something of that ilk, because then the employee can leave a bad working environment/move to where they are better suited. Additionally, it is problematic that the government is encouraging developers to come and put people out of work. Fundamentally, that's what tech jobs are supposed to do: by making things more efficient, you have fewer people making more money.<p>Funnily enough, immigration into the US has traditionally been to fill lower-class working roles. The slave trade was the first and most obvious example of this, but we also have Chinese, Irish and southern European immigrants in the 19th century. If immigration is what made our country an economic powerhouse (and at the very least, the slave trade was one of the primary contributors to our capitalist development), then we should be encouraging all immigrants, not just those who can be immediately identified as ""strategically important.""",1367254663

Facebook/Google can either pay a star developer 600k/yr for the duration of his stay, or bring a foreign indentured developer and train him for 60k/yr. The choice here may not be obvious, but the reality is that both of these strategies  are employed.<p>Most top tech companies have executives which are paid 10 to 100x the base developer salary, because they manage a hive of indentured foreign workers who can do the menial dev work. These executives essentially become ""Architects"". This is the best case scenario, in the worst case, the architects are also trained or outsourced.<p>The economics of this situation are very simple to understand, and explain why most companies employ the dual strategy to significantly reduce their costs. Green card holders have the option of negotiating for more compensation as they gain experience, but foreign workers without status do not have this option. As such, they are a far better bargain over the long run, assuming both are of equal ability as fresh new grads.",1367254641

I oppose increasing immigration because coding is one of the few remaining pathways to a solid middle class life in the US, and I don't want that to change.<p>That said, quality hackers can feel very secure in 2013 and for the foreseeable future.<p>The point the article makes about the ample number of programmers graduating US universities is belied by the essential truth of FizzBuzz.<p>It is not graduates that are in short supply, it is high IQ individuals that can solve problems with computers.

Finding good developers is hard.  We spend months trying to hire for positions, sometimes interviewing dozens of people, before we find someone.  And we pay well, use modern technologies, have a great group of existing developers, and don't expect anyone to work more than 40 hours a week.<p>If you are a GOOD developer, the opportunities for you are endless.  And the bar for being a ""good"" developer is NOT very high relative to the range of abilities found among all software developers.  Even horribly incompetent developers do not seem to have much trouble finding work (they do have trouble finding work at this company... usually).<p>I think the reason why roughly one third of ""computer and information science"" graduates aren't working in their field is because they themselves chose not to work in this field.  The work isn't for everyone.  I know quite a few people who majored in CS, were able to grind through it to get their degree, but can't stand the thought of doing this for a career.  Their motivations for going into the field out of high school vary, and many are misguided, but how can you really hold a 17 year old to making a 40 year life decision?<p>We need more good developers.  If we were allowed to hire more international developers, I can tell you we would not hire one crap developer ""because they are cheap.""  A crap developer does not just do less quality work than a good developer, they do NEGATIVE work that costs the company more than the salary difference between them and a good developer.<p>From a self concerned strategic standpoint, the U.S. should use the opportunity of immigration reform to steal good developers from other countries.

The philosophical underpinnings of free software are different than the underpinnings of good science.<p><i>nods</i> to your first answer. I would also say that being able to distribute source (with or without modifications) to others is important, though not as crucial. This prevents someone (<i>cough</i> Elsevier <i>cough</i> ACS) from having a monopoly on providing the source. But a restriction on, say, military use or wiretapping would not inhibit scientific progress, even if such a restriction makes it something other than free or open source software.<p>As for the second question, the scientific software I sell is not nor ever has been publicly funded. The people who have paid for it are all for-profit organizations. I don't even get R&D tax credits for it. While you're correct that much of science is publicly funded, my software isn't.<p>Going back to that question: are there limits on what I can charge people in order to get access to my open source software, which was used for a paper? If so, what are they, and what is the ethical basis for that judgment?<p>I can tell you that I would rather not publish a paper, in order to earn income selling my software, than to describe the techniques I used in making the software and the corrections and improvements to the existing literature that I developed. Which is better for overall scientific progress, and why?<p>This is especially important should I choose to publish as open access, since that journal in my field costs about $1,200, so I'm already planning to pay over a month's rent in order to publish. Should I also expect to lose the equivalent of a year's salary, in the hopes that publishing the paper helps as big enough advertisement to my services?",1367252989

And once you learn the basics, everything transfers back up to higher-level languages pretty well (with the exception of mental hex arithmetic, which will still come in handy as soon as you segfault your high-level language's runtime). Plus, when reverse-engineering, you can't fall back or get frustrated and use a compiler - unless you have an IDA + HexRays license for some reason, you're stuck figuring things out yourself.<p>As a side-note, it's always fun watching my dad work - he's an oldschool mainframe guy and he'll sometimes solve common setup issues using JCL or REXX stuff with a modified date sometime in the late 1980s.",1367252962

Those numbers are almost as bad as recent law school grad stats.<p>Needless to say as a life long STEM guy I'm strongly encouraging my kids to avoid the STEM field at all costs.  I'm not annoyed at my kids school for focusing on STEM; its a very good educational technique and not any worse than other educational fads.  As a vocation choice STEM is as likely to be as unrewarding as trying to become a rock star, a pro NBA player, or a fine arts painter, but those classes are great in K-12 schools.  Those examples, and STEM, make truly excellent hobbies, but awful jobs, at least for most of the participants.  I may not know the right answer, but I know STEM is the wrong answer.  I'll still love my kids anyway, no matter if they become unemployed programmers or unemployed musicians, but I hope they can do better financially with their lives both for themselves and the grandkids, by being quided out of ""hobby"" jobs like STEM and music and art and into something with a profitable future.",1367252292

But there is SO much more to being a useful tech than programming! And I'm much more sophisticated about big-picture thinking, business, and planning these days. Back when I was barely past ""junior"", I got to work on some really cool software at a dotcom-era startup. Technically, it was a blast. As a business decision, it was absolutely idiotic, and it was a massive management failure to have us wasting our time on it at all. (Basically, the idea was that six man-months of code at the time would save the company millions in the future. Which would have been true, if it HAD a future. Never, ever waste precious development effort on something that can be bought easily off-the-shelf and isn't core competence for your product! That's not even a good use of time in an established company, much less a ticking-clock startup!)<p>As I'm prone to saying, I cost as much as two junior programmers, but I can do things that two junior programmers can't do. And actually, cost is one of the problems older programmers have... senior == expensive. On the other hand, if you're in the industry for 20+ years and haven't found a way to make yourself and your work more valuable than what some drone straight out of college can do, but you expect to get paid more than said drone, you're asking to get sidelined.<p>The problem isn't the myth that older programmers are less flexible than younger ones. The problem is that so many older programmers haven't attended to their careers in a way to make themselves substantially more valuable than some pliant kid. It's not enough to do the kid's job better... you have to do things the kid CANNOT do.",1367252037

As a very --very-- green college student I ended up presenting a paper on this project at an international ACM conference.<p>Once you bootstrap an embedded system with Forth the world changes. In '85 there were few reasons to slog it out using hand-coded assembler to automate a labeling machine.

5627009,comment,5624727,5626513,2,0,rl3,,,"I agree. It's certainly more prudent to go with the flow [of piracy] rather than waste time and resources struggling against it. The Hotline Miami developers did just that.[1]<p>Although the 93.6% piracy rate the Greenheart Games article references initially seemed shocking, I was reminded of the stance Gabe Newell has repeatedly taken over the years, of piracy being a service issue.[2] Part of that can be applied to this situation.<p>a) Convenience<p>With third party content distribution, the customer is likely purchasing the game via an interface they're already familiar with. They are used to acquiring their content through this interface on a regular basis. For the sake of argument, if you were to compare: Steam, torrents, and a checkout form on the developer's website, the latter sadly doesn't stand a chance in the contest for convenience. Since Game Dev Tycoon isn't on Steam yet, which distribution method wins out? Piracy.<p>There's actually nothing wrong with the game's website purchasing process; it's quite nicely streamlined and requires no login. However, a lot of people tend to loathe buying games directly from a developer's website, because it results in fragmentation of their games library, and it's one more purchase to keep track of. Some users are militant about keeping the entirety of their games on one platform for just this very reason.<p>b) Exposure<p>Game Dev Tycoon is currently on Steam Greenlight but not yet approved. If they have the good fortune to be green-lit, the piracy rate may just turn on its head.<p>The game is also available via Windows Store. To put it gently, Windows Store isn't exactly Steam. That said, I'd be interested in the ratio of sales between their website and Windows Store (my money is on the site).<p>c) Benefits<p>If you search this story, you'll quickly notice that it has spread like wildfire across the gaming press. The game is receiving large amounts of publicity as a result. Said publicity may end up being what tips the Steam Greenlight scales in its favor towards availability on the Steam platform, which in turn would ostensibly result in a <i>massive</i> boost in sales.<p>Not to detract from the cleverness of Greenheart's experiment and subsequent article, but I find it more than a bit ironic that the egregious 93.6% piracy rate may in fact be what indirectly results in Game Dev Tycoon game making it on to Steam in the first place.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/10/25/hotline-miami-devs-endorse-pirate-bay-torrent-of-their-own-game-provide-helpful-suggestions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/10/25/hotline-miami-devs-endorse...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/114391-Valves-Gabe-Newell-Says-Piracy-Is-a-Service-Problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/114391-Valves-Gabe...</a>",1367251535
