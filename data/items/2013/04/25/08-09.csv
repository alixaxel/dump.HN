In the same manner, as a student of logic I will not come across special notation from analysis.<p>Although I am not working in that area any more, when I used interactive theorem provers the one I used mostly would present the proofs in Sequent calculus. It showcased a nice connection between the logical framework and a small step operational semantics reading of te formulas.<p>In my view, it is important to understand the reasons for different fields choices of notation; it typically reveals interesting things about the fields in question. When starting out learning a new field, it often seems strange and un-intuitive, but after a while one starts to recognize that there are many valid reasons for why a certain style of notation is used. Of course, sometimes it is just an accident of history, and bad choices stick around :)<p>I've hopped around quite a bit in my studies (semantics, formal methods, operations research, theoretical computer science, pure algebra, logic), and I always feel overwhelmed with new notations and concepts.

I disagree with the !important declaration though. I use LESS for writing CSS and while it's definitely a valuable asset to have, the ability to nest and have super specific queries generated means when you'e writing media queries, you sometimes don't want to have to replicate the nesting and specificities instead of just going .element and using !important instead saves time and space. Why is everyone so against using !important? Sometimes when you're overriding CSS added to an element via Javascript you have to use !important, regardless of how specific you are.<p>Cool idea, but considering IE8 support is on its way out from developers what hacks are left we need to use? Using overflow: hidden instead of resolving a problem is just lazy, it's not a hack, it's plain lazy.

5606209,comment,5606039,5606039,23,0,emillon,,,"Hindley-Milner (never seen it written as M-H) is beautiful because it's an elegant extension of simply-typed lambda calculus (STLC) that brings a very useful trait, polymorphism.<p>Here the first 3 rules are those of STLC. The magic happens in [Gen] and [Inst]: namely, you can generalize free type variables. If you have a function that works on lists of elements of type t when there is no constraint on t, they can work on any lists of any type. This brings quantification to the type system, ie you go from:<p><pre><code>     a. reverse :  list   list\n</code></pre>\nto<p><pre><code>    reverse :  .  list   list\n</code></pre>\n(in the first one,  is part of the discourse, and in the second one, part of the type). [Inst] states that you can replace a quantified variable by any variable. This is the role of the  operator, which is unfortunately not explained in this notation. This is confusing for people not used to type systems, ie most people).<p>Technically, [Let] is redundant because it is a combination of [App]+[Abs] : let x = e1 in e2 is equivalent to (x.e2) e1. There is a difference in the ML branch of languages (as opposed to the Haskell branch) because in the presence of memory references (mutable cells) you can't generalize everywhere, so only let-bound variables are given a type scheme  (both in the let...in construct and in toplevel phrases). That's why there is usually an explicit generalisation step at this point. Or maybe I have overlooked this particular presentation. HTH",1366878788

But the public school budget is not a fixed amount of money, and there's no reason that a drive to vouchers couldn't be accompanied by a net increase in money to schools. Your argument is not against vouchers.<p><pre><code>    Teacher's also recognize that charter schools have one\n    ability they do not, unload disruptive and\n    under-performing students before test time.\n</code></pre>\nYou don't need to have both models. All schools could be voucher schools. Eventually the better ones will chase the others out of business. For disabled students, have a special voucher load for them and let schools specialise.<p><pre><code>    Please explain? I've gone to public universities and\n    don't remember vouchers at any point. \n</code></pre>\nIt changes from region to region. But in general, there is an applications process where potential students indicate an intention to enter a university. The university has a certain number of spaces available, and tries to fill them. If students don't meet a standard, or it has more demand than there are places, it rejects people. It gets funding based on how many students it gets in. That's a voucher model: student choice + school choice + per-unit funding.<p>From memory, in Swizerland, it's more pronounced. I think students say where they want to go, and the university has to accept them and find a way to make it work. But they get commensurate funding for it. If this is correct, this is quite remarkable. If you live in Switzerland and want to go to the most prestigious university, you just say so and you're there. They're not obliged to give you passing marks once you're there. It takes all the snobbery out of things!",1366878200
