Creepy! (acceptable)<p>- Did the ugly guy two tables over compliment you on your looks when you were both trying to get a drink at the bar? Creepy! (not so acceptable.)<p>- Did the guy you were dating for a few months ask you for a 5' in-person conversation after you decided to break up out of the blue over SMS? Creepy! (that one happened to me and I felt personally threatened by this woman's implicit threat of slander)<p>It's also interesting how prevalent the notion of ""creepyness"" is in the US. Whereas in other cultures the same guy would be considered annoying, inconvenient, misguided or justifiedly threatening, here a blanket term is applied and everyone accepts it. The same principle applies to a lot of emotional stuff, where Americans apply very coarse ""pattern matching"" to behaviors that other cultures are way more nuanced about.",1365656398

This is not about them having a reputation as a concept.<p>My point is that Google suggesting you register a different domain because their href-based reputation sucks over time is a cop-out. This specifically falls under the ""Things that are Google's fault"".<p>Matt's suggestion here is definitely practical, but it's a fault in how Google looks at domain reputation. When he talks about ""having to renovate a domain"" he's talking about you the consumer of a domain legally acquired and without spammy content hosted on it, having to play Google's algorithm, because their definition of ""spam"" is absolutely massive, vaguely defined, and with way too long of a ttl.<p>And with a massive, undefined, long term concept of spam, you're going to have ridiculous FPs. Which Google has, and is now recommending is somehow your responsibility.<p>This is entirely their fault, and it has to do with how they are determining reputation, not that they have reputation at all.",1365656349

5530043,comment,5527489,5527489,1,0,ajays,,,"People are bringing up ""market forces"", etc.<p>The solution that I think would work in SF is as follows. Charge a flat rate (say, $50K/year; though a Dutch Auction might be reasonable too) for leasing out a permit to qualified drivers. You qualify drivers by running background checks, and testing them on the knowledge of the city. Pass a law that makes illegally running a cab a serious offence. This will automatically solve the ""tragedy of the commons"" or ""too many cabs"" problem, because if there are too many cabs, they won't be able to make the $50K/year needed to break even.\nIf 2000 cabs (a number 20% larger than the current fleet size) enroll in this, you're looking at an additional $100M/year.<p>To run the program, have a small enforcement wing of SFMTA (instead of the current gigantic bureaucracy that micromanages everything). Offer up an open API so people can build apps that track cabs, hail cabs, etc.<p>The medallion system is 19th century. We need a 21st century system.",1365655813

Unless you have a very niche skill set and can come in as a consultant, you will find it very hard to get part time hours.<p>What I would like to suggest to you is to do the following:<p>1) Incorporate a company.<p>2) Go talk to small and medium sized software consulting/services companies within your area. These are companies that do software consulting or custom development for other companies. These can include web development shops, SharePoint shops (if that is your skillset) or some of the bigger consulting firms (such as Ideaca).<p>These companies are more willing to take on contractors. They especially like hiring part time if its the right fit as it saves them money. Their clients usually don't know/(may not care) who does the work.<p>You can charge your rate (lets say in the $50-$90/hour range) or even better setup retainers for each company with a fixed number of hours a month that you will commit. If they do not use all the hours for the month, they still pay you the retainer. If they go over the hours, then they pay you your rate.<p>I believe you will find more success with the smaller consulting firms (firms with less than 20 employees and that serve the local market) but this does depend on your skill set.<p>I expect it will be hard for you to get one of these arrangements with the first company but it will be easier after the first.<p>It is quite possible for you to work for 3-4 of these companies and make a reasonable income.<p>In effect, you would be a freelancer but you would not have direct clients.<p>A lot of these depends on your skill set and what is needed in your area. If you are a open-source stack developer and you are surrounded by .NET shops, you will obviously have a tough time. If this is the case, you are likely to be more successful if you pickup the skill set that's relevant for your area.",1365654028

They have been distributed for longer than we have known. With the evolution in MOOCs, we have seen colleges offer their courses for free to anyone who wishes to take them. Coursera and Udacity, for example, offer classes, but the only way to tell if you have completed them is through a certificate of completion.<p>The way I see it, education is one of the last things to change with the way technology is going. It makes sense: it's a fragile subject to mess with. However, there is not a better time to change the way you apply for a career. With the way we interact with friends, watch movies, shop, and listen to music all being fully implemented into the web, education is next in line for its turn.<p>Some people have asked ""isn't it right that we also send my job to the web too?"" No! What needs to be examined is efficiency and what is best for our daily needs. When you work a job, it is best to be in an environment with your collages surrounding you. In terms of education, that payment for room and board amongst the payment for tuition is what makes student loan debt the largest source of debt in the United States.<p>The way I see it, this is the next step.<p>I have nothing to do with these guys, I just think that they hit the nail on the head in terms of the next direction in education.",1365653012

I said that programming in, reading programs in, and compiling programs in Scheme was like programming in, reading programs in, and compiling programs in assembly language in some specific ways, and very unlike it in others.  The relationship between Scheme and ML is that some of the central insights of Scheme were adopted by ML.<p>② ML defines evaluation order.  The lambda calculus does not.  Typical ML implementations compile to the assembly languages of actual processors.  Can you clarify?<p>③ I think Scheme is sufficiently well defined for this discussion — it's a family of languages originating in some papers by Sussman and Steele in the 1970s, and continuing through the current R7RS work, including a number of compilers.  Several of the standards define the semantics of the language symbolically, not just in English.",1365652923
