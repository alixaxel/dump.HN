5510289,comment,5509254,5509254,9,0,tikhonj,,,"Following that paper, a friend and I implemented a simple MCMC-based synthesizer for the GreenArrays chip (a very low-power and rather obtuse architecture based on a variant of Forth).<p>Most of the code is up on GitHub in several different repos[1][2]. I'm actually rather proud of some of the code, especially part of the F18A interpreter (F18A is the name of the instruction set on GreenArrays chips). It's rather short and neat.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/array-forth"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/TikhonJelvis/array-forth</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/jacobt/mcmc-synthesis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jacobt/mcmc-synthesis</a><p>My version actually supports loops and even self-modifying code. This no doubt has some performance implications--my current approach is to throttle each test case to take at most as many steps as the input program does. For various reasons, I found it easier to just allow loops than to try to stick to loop-free code.<p>I found that their correctness measure--looking at the number of bits that differs from the expected result--was basically useless for GreenArrays. I actually have some graphs lying around which show how it basically doesn't vary until it suddenly finds a correct program and shoots up to being 100% correct immediately. It does not exhibit the nice hill-climbing behavior that we want.<p>For better or worse, I have not been able to get this style of approach to perform as well as a similar synthesizer using an SMT solver (namely Microsoft's Z3). The advantage with the MCMC system is that it's easily parallelizable. It can also deal with certain programs that can choke up the SMT-based version.<p>The SMT-based system has problems dealing with lots of bits, so we usually run it pretending that the architecture uses ~4 bits instead of 18 (yes, it uses 18 by default!). So for problems requiring more precision, the MCMC approach might be better. Similarly, the SMT system does not model memory terribly efficiently, so problems needing a lot of mutated memory might be better for the randomized system.<p>Also, I should add that I know literally nothing about machine learning and even less about SMT solvers, so it's not surprise that the things I have written don't perform terribly well. Basically, my only solace is that this project's code is mostly rather elegant. I learned quite a bit about programming at a high level of abstraction from this project--some of the things I ended up doing rely on significantly more abstract reasoning than anything I've done before.<p>Anyhow, it's cool to see people reading about something I've been playing around with for a while now. Even if I find the whole field a trifle annoying :P.<p>If you want to play around with this sort of synthesizer, I have uploaded both a generic library based around MCMC[3]--it's surprisingly simple--and the GreenArrays-specific code[4] to cabal, so they're both just a cabal install away.<p>[3]: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mcmc-synthesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/mcmc-synthesis</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/array-forth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/array-forth</a>",1365403260

The first amendment gives advertisers wide latitude with the kind of claims they make, and even fairly blatant exaggeration is OK as sales talk is expected to involve a degree of 'puffery'. I like the first amendment but as a consumer I sometimes find the almost universal use of bait-and-swtich tactics in American advertising extremely tedious.<p>In this case I think Tesla went too far with their claims and the market (both on Main and Wall street) is punishing them accordingly. The buyback guarantee was a good idea, as is the lease scheme. Of course they want to make the price seem attractive, but I think they could have been frank about a $1000/month lease cost and got the same amount of business or even more.

5510193,comment,5510170,5510170,1,0,jcr,,,"On the first of every month there's a ""Who is Hiring?"" post\nmade by the HN user 'whoishiring'. It gets comments from a\nlot of companies looking for people (April 1st had over 400\ncomments). I enjoy reading all of them simply because it's\nfun to see what others are doing. In the most recent, there\nwere some companies hiring in India.<p>Since these submissions have so many comments, there is a 'more'\nlink at the bottom of the page. Due to the way HN only caches\ndata for a short period of time (the dreaded ""unknown link' message)\nyour best bet is to load the first page, scroll to the bottom, and\nopen the 'more' link in another tab. Keep repeating until you\nhave all of the pages loaded in separate tabs.<p>HN User: whoishiring<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoishiring</a><p>The ""Who Is Hiring?"" submission for April 2013<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5472746"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5472746</a>",1365401015

The required HTML and CSS is compiled into the JS now to reduce number of files to transfer. I don't know how many images it is right now but if it is more than 1, then we will likely eventually compile it down to 1.<p>Sunny",1365400968

They're notable for that, and I don't think any other mainstream distribution (if Slackware even counts as that) excludes it.<p>At least in the multi-user environments I manage, PAM works well, and we maintain some custom PAM modules to do things like handle unpaid accounts with warnings then lockout.<p>It's a little complex but I don't know of any viable alternative -- setting up Kerberos on Slackware is a big pain last I checked.  Maybe not relevant to single user machines, but that's not the context we're talking about here.",1365400951
