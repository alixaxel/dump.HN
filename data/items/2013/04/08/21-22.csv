Nobody really used it so I decided to just open source the code. I had a couple questions for the HN community. I'm still new to the github world.<p>1. Is this kind of project useful to anybody in the open source community at all? It's a bigger app without great documentation and a narrow range of uses. I'm sure the code quality isn't superb either, so should I even be putting it out there?<p>2. It isn't really the kind of thing that you can install easily, like wordpress or a ruby gem. There are a lot of gem dependencies and someone else would probably struggle through a number of things to get a working installation. Should I not open source something like this unless I spent a ton of time writing installation instructions, and or cleaning up the whole thing first?<p>On a side note, I'd be grateful for any feedback on my code quality. I know there are some big issues, like the absence of any tests. (I just wanted to ship something in rails first, before learning TDD). But any other feedback would be much appreciated. I think my ruby abilities have gotten a bit better since this app, but I would still love to hear any advice.

I know, I know... it's easy to sit back and say ""WTF, the Semantic Web is a pipe-dream, and it's been being developed for 15 years and it isn't here yet"" etc., etc.<p>I will counter that by contending that the Semantic Web <i>is</i> here, just not fully so, and furthermore, that a more and more complete Semantic Web is inevitable.<p>My feeling is that you couldn't go wrong learning RDF, SPARQL, etc, AND, more specifically, focus on NLP.  Why NLP? Because NLP is the bridge between the gazillions of petabytes of ""stuff"" that's out there that <i>isn't</i> part of the Semantic Web, and the structured data that does make up the Semantic Web.  When you can use NLP (and related tech) to extract semantic meaning from free-form text and then make it part of the Semantic Web, that's pretty powerful stuff.<p>Take a look, for example, at Apache Stanbol[1] and the stuff they're doing with extracting structure from text.<p>Also, look at things like dbpedia[2] and the Linked Data[3] initiative.  Seriously, seriously cool stuff is going on...<p>[1]: <a href=""http://stanbol.apache.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stanbol.apache.org</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.dbpedia.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dbpedia.org</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://linkeddata.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://linkeddata.org</a>",1365458309

5514913,comment,5511498,5514630,5,0,Lazare,,,"Configuration files probably include database passwords, AWS secrets, API keys, maybe even SSH keys.  Fairly clearly:<p>1. They're really important and change periodically in sync with the rest of the app.\n2. They shouldn't be in a public repo under any circumstance, EVER.\n3. You probably don't want every single developer having access to your production database passwords.<p>Point 1 argues strongly in favour of putting them into version control for all the same reasons you'd put <i>anything</i> into version control.<p>Point 2 and 3 argues for putting them in your .gitignore (or equivalent) and copying files around by hand (or via a fabric script or what have you) during deploys.<p>Common wisdom seems to be that point 2 and 3 outweighs point 1, and for open source projects which live in public repos it probably should.  Ditto for large enterprisey projects.  But for a startup, working on a non-open source project, I think point 1 massively outweighs everything else.<p>As an example, the most common advice for configuration for django apps is to have a settings.py which imports a settings_local.py; you then put settings_local.py into .gitignore, and in every environment you create a new settings_local.py and add the local settings (database connection strings, template paths, whatever) into it.  I started out doing it that way too, but I've recently reversed it:  Now I have a settings_dev.py, settings_staging.py, etc, each with the specific environment settings, and each of which imports the common settings from settings.py, and all of which are in source control.  Now I can checkout any branch or version of my app, and have some confidence that I've got the right settings to run it in whatever environment I want.<p>(I see philjackson has listed another reason for being careful with config files, but I'm not sure I agree.  I'd say he's basically giving an argument for using different config files in different environments, and generally being a bit organised.  And if there is any risk of developers fat fingering the config files, isn't that an argument to have them in version control so you can fix it easily?)",1365458305

For instance as I was saying in the previous comment it's beneficial for those with the cash and income streams as they become more valuable as time goes on and its good for the debtor.<p>However, you are correct in that there is always going to be a semi-stable price (or a price floor) when the money supply starts to help create inflation and grow the economy again. In terms of how it’s bad for Bitcoin building on the previous comment, let’s pretend that people have bought coins at $200 and deflation kicks which means that, people either hoard it (to try and get something cheaper tomorrow) OR once it hits a certain level everyone tries to recover their losses and starts selling the coins which causes an economic crash to a highly volatile market (a $500k trade can usually cause a lot of issues) and the market will not level out until, there are enough buyers interested to buy back into Bitcoin.",1365458036

What I still don't understand is,<p>> <i>Once people are reluctant to spend then, the economy will stay depressed because, people expect deflation AND deflation will continue because the economy remains depressed.</i><p>Well, if people are expecting deflation, then that expectation becomes built into the value of the currency, such that there exists an equilibrium between people expecting it to deflate further, and people expecting it do the opposite, because it's already overly valuable.<p>I can't see how everyone would just hoard it until there's infinite demand and zero supply, and a bitcoin has infinite value. There's always a semi-stable price.<p>And like I said, I don't see how the standard macroeconomic arguments apply, because right now bitcoin is just a currency ""on the side"", totally unable to affect economies on a large scale. And if it ever <i>did</i> reach that scale, governments could do things like force contracts to be denominated in some government-controlled ratio to bitcoins, so that the government would still be able to ""control"" the money supply, and increase or decrease it as desired. (That's just one crude example of how.)<p>Just because people are using bitcoins, doesn't mean that long-term contracts have to be denominated in bitcoins.<p>So I guess this is what confuses me about people saying that bitcoin deflation is bad. Deflation=bad arguments seem to rest on entire countries being solely dependent on a single currency, which is not the case with bitcoin. And even that <i>became</i> the case, it would presumably take place in a whole new way.

5514695,comment,5514091,5514472,2,0,rabble,,,"There are countries where this is being done. Uruguay is tiny and highly urbanized, but it's got a goal of achieving this very thing. Every phone line in the country, there are only about 900,000, comes with free no cost broadband. You get 1GB of traffic free, an extra GB of traffic if you visit educational sites associated with One Laptop Per Child. Speaking of which, every child in the country gets a laptop, so they can get online.<p>So they've achieved two goals of universal access already. They gave everybody a computer and everybody a slow but free internet connection.<p>Now that they achieved that, they are rolling out fiber to the country. So far it's just in some neighborhoods of the capital, but if you can get it's a pretty good deal 120M fiber connection for $83 USD per month. Beyond fixed line internet, there's 3G/4G coverage over every city/town/village with good bandwidth (i got 5m up / down last time i tried it).<p>How did they do this? The government treats getting good internet access as a human right. There's ANTEL, a state telco monopoly which sees it's mission as getting everybody online. There's a viable threat that if ANTEL didn't do it's job, the market could be opened to competition. Bridging the digital divide is a national priority and so Uruguay has chosen to invest heavily in making sure everybody's included and online. As a result, Uruguay has the highest internet penetration rates in Latin America.<p>Other parts of the state, like the energy company is well on it's way to eliminating the need of fossil fuels for electricity production, primarily through hydro and wind power.<p>Utilities are precisely places where the state can, has, and should continue to provide a common level of service everybody can expect. Getting universal internet access, cheap and fast, is something any country can achieve if they decide it's important. If a tiny country in south american you've never heard of with $15k gdp per capita and 3.8 cows per person can do it, the wealthiest country in the world should be able to pull it off.",1365456017

5514657,comment,5511466,5513999,2,0,saintx,,,"I am enjoying this part of the discussion.  One of the things that struck me a few years ago was how the design of the web was so heavily oriented around trying to reproduce the print media industry in a browser.  Thus, we get the ""markup"" of HTML, which provides layout at the expense of structure.  Later on, we added CSS which ideally should provide layout, but bad habits learned at an early age or provided by tools that came about in the 90s still haven't caught up in many cases to this day.<p>There's no concept of ""line 4 of chapter 3 of book X"" in the web, at least not down at its core.  You have to shim it in with anchor tags or something similar, and as a result we don't have ubiquitous browser apps that let me highlight a snippet of text in a book, write some notes in the margin (example: ""this is a reference to Hamlet's soliloquy""), and then on a whim search for all of Noam Chomsky's (or whoever's) notes on Hamlet, or perhaps search for all public notes on this book in the context of Hamlet.  The lack of structure means that everything's this haphazard soup of markup, with the focus being so much on how it looks that structure of the text and the relationship between parts gets lost.  I'm not sure the ""semantic web"" will make up for that lack, but it's probably a good example of how the ""next web will be built on the bones of this one"" (to paraphrase someone else's comment in this thread).",1365455667

However if prices are falling through deflation then, you’re not incentivised to spend because; you’re going to get a better deal tomorrow. Now as currencies are supposed to be used as a medium of exchange to facilitate transactions, spending is really important because it’s how the market participants interact with one and other (and considering Bitcoin isn’t backed by a commodity this is important). Once people are reluctant to spend then, the economy will stay depressed because, people expect deflation AND deflation will continue because the economy remains depressed.<p>In order for an economy to get out of the deflationary trap and to counter deflation, fiat currencies can use monetary policy to increase the money supply and deliberately induce rising prices, causing inflation. Raising the prices is the essential foundation of an economic recovery because; businesses can increase their profits which takes pressure off debtors etc and an example of this is the fiscal stimulus used by the Obama Administration with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009[1].  However, Bitcoin can only produce 25 Bitcoins every 10 minutes (which is being halved every 4 years from 2017) and this can create a liquidity trap because the injections of cash fail to stimulate economic growth – as a result, if Bitcoin is in a recession and is unable to stimulate economic growth it will eventually turn into deflation & <i>deflation is only bad for people who cannot borrow more</i> and unlike fiat currencies who can borrow more, Bitcoin has a fixed supply (and isn't even backed by a commodity) which means that, there could potentially be serious issues for the economy’s wealth.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestm...</a>",1365455324

My git projects were never even looked at and I was once told to my face that the company doesn't hire physics majors for developer positions. Now, two months on the job, I've fixed runaway JavaScript code that ruined UX on various pages, decreased memory overhead by at least 50% as a starting point and extended a large open source project so it does more for us. These are just the projects out of my own initiative. In the meantime my physics friends are largely unemployed (all but two, me being one of those two) and no company wants any training at all. So forgive me if I'm all out of sympathy for these companies, even if I feel for the global workers affected, but I've seen first-hand the dehumanizing dismissiveness that you are treated with as an entry level dev",1365454988

That way instead of having the script and having the potential to abuse the script (or temptation) someone would be forced to allow tracking of the IP (presumably their own or their companies) that they are doing the testing on (and you could compile statistics for use elsewhere as a condition if they got the script for free). I know companies already offer this service  (we had to go through one of those for PCI) but iirc it was rather expensive. FWIW the bank that required it never followed up after the initial ""you have to do this and we suggest this particular company"".",1365454987

My point about ""looking out the window"" is that while we've been operating on a supposedly Keynesian theory in trying to repair our economy these past six years, it has consipicuously, repeatedly, and grossly failed to correctly predict the results of its own massive interventions. You don't need fancy economic theories to see how it has failed, you need merely open your eyes and look around. (And I include newspapers and television, etc, in the looking around, so my point is that it is easy to see the failures, not that it's failing literally right outside my window.) You need fancy economic theories to explain how even though the results are awful, we're still doing the right things even so.<p>Keynesians cover this by claiming it would have been even worse without the near-continuous and now open-ended ""stimulus"". I don't believe them. Had they said in advance that the current scenario was a significant possibility, I would at least listen, but instead we've been in a world where ""recovery is just around the corner"" for about four years now. It isn't, it hasn't been, and it continues not to be. I find it a valid theory that Keynesianism is the reason why, rather than the thing saving us. The fact that we're talking about a ""new normal"" is also code for ""Keynesianism is a failure of an economic theory, but rather than give up the theory because we like it too much, we're going to tell people to just get used to being poorer.""<p>(Of course if you want to say that our politicians are only using the name of Keynes for a cover while in fact not acting particularly Keynesian, well, I beat you to it. Keynesianism isn't, really. But nobody seems to open with that defense, only use it as a fallback when attacked. It's true enough in theory, but a useless defense of the theory's current users, which are what I'm actually critical of. The real Keynes is a great deal smarter than the psuedo-Keynes being used to drive policy today, but also a great deal less influential.)",1365454822

Canada is not a small area, a city or a state. It is an entire 'continent' spanning multiple provinces with very different laws and dynamics. A startup in Waterloo, Ontario targeted towards engineering may fare better than one founded in Vancouver.<p>Secondly, he is mentioning his connections in the Bay Area that have helped him succeed in Canada. First he is arguing FOR founding a startup in Canada but then admits that most of his barriers to entry were lifted with help from the valley. There is a difference when you're starting fresh in Waterloo without any outside help.<p>I think what the author should have done is draw a parallel between The Valley and somewhere in Canada (Waterloo, Vancouver, Montreal, etc...). One may not be better than the other but perhaps working WITH The Valley can help get your startup off the ground elsewhere.<p>I would personally love to work for a startup back home in Toronto and perhaps one day found my own but I don't see the same enthusiasm towards tech and startup in Toronto that I see here in The Valley.",1365454816
