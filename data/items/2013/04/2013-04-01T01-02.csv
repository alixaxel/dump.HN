If I were you I'd put the details about plugins somewhere in the Wiki.<p>I don't have a lot of spare time to check out your thing, so the project becomes increasingly unattractive as I have to waste more and more time to figure out how to use it / how to get it up and running for a basic test.<p>Again, IMHO, I believe this applies to most hackers, and to open source documentation in general.

It's generally considered in software architecture that design that's decoupled is a little harder to build upfront, but survives change over time.<p>As a 'real life' example, because Twitter exposed internal details (a tweet ID), clients sorted based on that number, because they assumed it'd be monotonically increasing. Once sequential IDs became a problem with Twitter at scale, they had an issue: if they switched to GUIDs, clients would break, because they were sorting based on the ID value. They had to invent an entirely new algorithm (Snowflake) to adapt to this change. This wouldn't have happened if they hadn't leaked internal details. It's basic encapsulation.",1364781129

In our apps we call it ThingService, and I'm sure other groups have a different convention.<p>For example, we're using a legacy codebase now where there is some complicated logic involved in managing attributes for products.  ProductService is a singleton with no internal state that does things like removeAttribute(product, ""foo"") and serves other purposes.  Before we introduced this pattern this kind of functionality was copy-pasted all around our controllers.<p>In short, I don't see the harm in this convention.  Perhaps Manager or Service is bland name, but it's immediately clear to our developers what it does, and if you want to see if something has been done before with products, you look in Product or ProductService.",1364779800
