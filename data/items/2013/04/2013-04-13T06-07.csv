There are lights on tractors, you know. True, daylight is a better time for many farming activities, but during harvest, my father will sometimes work from 6am-2am if the conditions are good. (Yes, 20 hours though a nap after lunch is possible if there is someone else around to run the combine during that time).",1365836007
5542790,comment,5541401,5542744,2,0,Sodel,,,"I've started running tmux in all my terminals automatically, and conveniently sharing a ""master"" session between them all.<p>Instead of running tmux directly, I have a small script which creates a session named TMUX-MASTER if it doesn't already exist, and immediately detaches it. All the clients that I actually interact with are created separately and automatically grouped with the TMUX-MASTER session.<p>To prevent my system from being clogged by dozens of detached client sessions, I rebound prefix+d to kill-session, killing the client session but leaving my TMUX-MASTER session untouched. Closing terminals while running these client sessions, however, still leaves my system cluttered with dormant client sessions.<p>I'd like to see if a ""ephemeral"" option (it'd need a better name) could easily be added to new-session, which would cause the created session to just die when it's told to detach, or receives the HUP signal. It'd simplify things a bit.",1365836007

Reporting Microsoft for breaking their own browser ballot is not comparable to, say, a long running plan to hobble Google by antitrust rulings in the US and the EU[1] or an ad campaign modeled after negative political ad campaigns. So portraying this as some sort of no holds barred fight when one side is hardly playing is rather disingenuous.<p>Microsoft has improved in so many ways over the late 90s, it's kind of appalling to see what their obsession with Google does to them. I really don't understand it, except maybe just the old guard remaining in positions that can still make these things happen.<p>And please stop suggesting that we think that all the Windows engineers were retasked to file legal briefs in Oracle v Google. That's, again, exactly the point I was addressing. It's difficult to be excited about those engineers' work when their legal and marketing teams seem to think that the only way to ""win"" is to make the other guy look worse than they themselves are acting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://readwrite.com/2013/01/03/googles-ftc-settlement-is-an-epic-fail-for-microsoft"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readwrite.com/2013/01/03/googles-ftc-settlement-is-an...</a>",1365835881

I have been alarm clock-free for many years now.<p>Lately I find that my sleep is segmented; I was wondering if it's a bad thing.   I generally sleep from 3am to 8am or so, and then I wake up, eat an apple, and read the Internet.   And then I sleep from 9am to 11am again.  It's been pretty consistent for awhile.  It seems to be the pattern of 2 REM cycles and then 1, since I believe people generally get 3 in a night.<p>It's perhaps not the same thing, since it seems unrelated to daylight.  It may be related to information retention.  I generally wake up and write some notes about what I thought about during my sleep (lately I find that my dreams are almost like thinking).  And then I do some googling related to those topics.  And then I go back to sleep and retain it.<p>Another thing that's interesting about sleep is that humans have a dimorphism between early birds and night owls.  I read a hypothesis that it's because it maintains the property that some members of a group are a awake at all times, e.g. to guard against predators and so forth.",1365835642

That's more memory pressure than an imperative language like C, where the flow of data and computations is obvious. It's exacerbated by the tendency to factor a single function into many simpler ones.<p>In a team, the increased memory burden also requires more communication for shared understanding of code.<p>Many concatenative languages eventually grow support for local variables, since it's _incredibly_ awkward to implement certain algorithms when you have to do stack juggling to use a variable in a computation.",1365835303

Even internally, it's worth prototyping lots of ideas to find the best one to develop into a full game.<p>However, with over 700,000 apps on the app store, it's incredibly hard to get noticed at all. Therefore I think there's some value in working on something over a longer time frame, trying to build up a community around it.<p>Back around September of last year Jay and I were at a bit of a crossroads - keep going with ZOS/C3O, or switch to something else. In the end we decided to part ways, Jay left Binary Space in December and I decided to keep making updates for ZOS and C3O. I'm buying out Jay's share of Binary Space by giving him a share of revenue for the next several years.<p>Back in 2010-2012 we were trying to build Binary Space into a legitimate business - ie something that could support us full-time.

5542723,comment,5539231,5539231,3,0,a_p,,,"Investment bankers make money because they are allowed to borrow enormous sums of money (leverage) to invest. In other words, they are allowed to gamble with the money of others with very little consequences. There is no other industry where a company would be allowed to take on that much debt. It's like the old joke: How do you make a million dollars? Start with <i>n</i> million dollars! Even if you do make money in finance, your contribution to shareholders is probably a lot less than it would be in another line of work. Here [1] is an excellent write up about it.<p>In 2008, Barclays had over 43 times as much assets as they had equity (leverage ratio) while GlaxoSmithKline had a leverage ratio of 5. In 2011, GSK had a return on assets (money made from assets at its disposal) of 15%. Barclays had a ROA of 0.25%. GSK had a return on equity (ROE) of 67.2%, while Barclays had a ROE of 6.1%. In the same year, Barclays Capital (investment bank part of Barclays PLC) had a ROE of 10.3%, but had a leverage ratio of <i>55</i> and a ROA of just 0.18%. If you paid Barclays Capital employees the same salary as GSK employees, the pre-tax profits of BarCap  would have doubled. <i>That</i> is why bankers pay should be limited  their ROE would be better although their leverage ratios are still way too high.<p>TL;DR version: If you want to work in a field where you generate real value instead of gambling with someone else's money, find a job where you <i>make</i> things. The world doesn't need more inappropriate math models of finance (no, the market is not always rational and large volatility is more common than you think)  it needs real research.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.moneyweek.com/news-and-charts/economics/uk/bankers-dont-have-talent-just-lots-of-borrowed-money-57728"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneyweek.com/news-and-charts/economics/uk/banker...</a>",1365833043
5542722,comment,5541915,5542423,1,0,kijin,,,"According to [1], the 100 most frequently used passwords are used by 40% of people, and the 500 most frequently used passwords are used by 71% of people. So you can increase security for over half of your users simply by disallowing the 200 most commonly used passwords. This set of passwords is small enough to fit in an in-memory list, so you don't even need to use a database for that.<p>I don't think there's much need to check for common passwords <i>at each login</i>, provided that none of your users are allowed to use such passwords in the first place. You might get more security by banning IPs that try more than a few of those common passwords in a short time (it's a useful way to detect brute-force attempts), but in fact you should be banning <i>any</i> IP that generates more than a few failed logins in a short time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://xato.net/passwords/more-top-worst-passwords/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xato.net/passwords/more-top-worst-passwords/</a><p>Another measure I use on my webapps is calculating how many bits of entropy a password contains, and ban anything less than ~40 bits (the threshold depends on the target demographic). An 8-digit number has 10^8 = 26.5 bits of entropy. An 8-char lowercase string has 26^8 = 37.6 bits of entropy (unless it's a common word). A mixed-case 8-char string that also contains numbers has (26+26+10)^8 = 47.6 bits of entropy. This method has the advantage that I don't need to specify annoying rules like ""one lowercase, one uppercase, one symbol, etc."" Simpler passwords can be allowed if they are long enough, and complex passwords can be banned if they are too short.",1365833025
