5506778,comment,5506656,5506656,1,0,pippy,,,"If you're not working with device drivers, embedded systems, or legacy code/filetypes you probably shouldn't be using bitwise operations. It can be confusing to other programmers, make your code a mess, and you're repeating optimisations probably found in libraries.<p>This is just a generalisation of course, I use them on occasion. Mostly with string encoding oddities.<p>For me using excessive bit operations is a red flag. I wrote a messy 1000 line file format in C, I found out by chance there was a serialization function in the library. 10 lines, done. I repeated this mistake when I started learning python (pickle, you're the best).",1365332304
5506777,comment,5506656,5506685,1,0,saravk,,,"This is where macros (C) come in to play. Using macros (do all the bit shifting and masking inside) you can write very human readable code that is easy to maintain and while at the same time offers all the advantages of using bit-masks.<p>The major advantage of bitwise operators for me is the memory savings that come with them. I used to write the route calculation algorithms for routers and every bit/byte save had an tremendous impact on the total capacity of the router. We use bitfields to set and store various things from simple flags to multi-bit values, all inside a single integer variable.",1365332285

It's surprising how much trouble they have grasping trivial operations like ""a & a"" or ""b ^ b"", and understanding arithmetic equivalents, like using ""a << 2"" to multiply by four.

Couldn't justify the cost of a 1900 series Cisco and associated k9-sec license, so went for a RB1200 (512MB RAM, 1Ghz PPC chip, 10 physical ports, 5 of which can do hardware switching and wire-speed filtering) and a couple of Groove access points.<p>Getting tagged and untagged VLANs to interact together on a single port is a non-starter (not supported at all), and getting VLAN trunking and routing to work together simultaneously requires terminating the layer three interface on a virtual bridge, then for each VLAN you need to create a virtual VLAN interface for each physical interface, and then put that onto the bridge as a 'bridge port'. The documentation is very scant on this side of things and the command line interface is pretty arcane compared to IOS but does make sense after a while.<p>If they weren't 1/4 price (or less) than an equivalent product from $enterprise_vendor I'd hesitate to recommend them to anyone, but seeing as they are - if you've got a networking background and can put up with some of it's quirks and limitations, there is very little out there that can compete with Mikrotik on price/feature set.",1365331070

No need to log in - WhatsApp uses your phone number and a hash of your IMEI number as credentials to log in to their app. Although this means that your account could be compromised, its ease of use is therefore unparalleled.<p>2. No need to authorize people to add you - this means that if you have anyone's phone number, you already have them on your contact list. If I had to choose one reason for WhatsApp getting over a 100 million users in a short time, this would be it. A lot of people find this a privacy issue (including myself), but most people just don't care.<p>3. Sending images and video through WhatsApp is super easy and the content is compressed.<p>4.

It's ambiguous to parse, requiring the introduction of parenthesis. No one likes using the parenthesis, because it's ugly and takes up space, so on top of this (arguably bad foundation) we add in operator precedence. Genius -- except no one can remember all the rules. And when you leave out the parenthesis, and hand it to someone else, and it's ambiguous (i.e. has a complicated application of the operator precedence rules), how can you be sure the person meant what they wrote down?<p>The simple fact is that this:<p><pre><code>    2 2 +\n</code></pre>\nIs no more difficult to a child to understand than this:<p><pre><code>    2 + 2\n</code></pre>\nThe former has a lot to recommend it, and high-end calculators use it for that reason. The latter just plain sucks. But thanks to math, and it's inability to improve its own notation over time, we teach infix notation to 5 year olds.<p>Now, this is super simple example, and math can't even get this much right. With more complex mathematics, we see additional symptoms of the above problems:<p>1. complex, implicit rules associated with the notation<p>2. a tendency to ""leave important stuff off"" because the notation is too verbose<p>The latter happens <i>all the time</i>. I work in 3D rendering, and basically no one writes out full equations for things, ever, because it's so verbose. So to save space, we just leave it out.<p>Now, <i>I</i> know it's missing, because one time, I just happened to see the full, correct equation. But what about that <i>A la carte</i> math user? Can they just read the paper and then go ahead and write some code implementing it? Not even close. Laughably not even close.<p>Of course, I cheated here, because even this equation is presented in dozens of different ways (I'm thinking here of the Rendering equation[1]). Depending on who's writing the paper, you'll have have to decipher it out -- including dealing with all of the ""missing"" stuff they've left out to save space.<p>All of math is like this, though. There's is no such thing as a self-contained math paper. Things are rarely ""written out"" at the level of detail we expect in CS.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_equation</a>",1365329868
