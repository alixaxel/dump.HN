5537750,comment,5537190,5537382,2,0,ericd,,,"Thanks for mentioning that! I'm just getting into Django, and a friend recommended getting TSoD, and it's been pretty spectacularly unhelpful for actually learning how to do the basics like deployment (though I could see how it would be useful for clearing up bad habits). The Django book looks absolutely fantastic for learning the basics, better than most commercial software books I've read in the past. Wonder why they don't point to it explicitly in the Django docs tutorial.<p>Edit: Never mind - while it's good, I've already run into a couple areas where it seems to be severely outdated, so I could see why it wouldn't be advertised too heavily.",1365764388

I'd increase the typographic contrast here.<p>- Number of comments is probably the 2nd thing I look at after the title, having it over on the right makes it harder to visually associate the comments count + link with its submission.

Sounds fun. I give you two weeks on a highway.<p>My daily commute (3km by bicycle) includes 100m of main road (and optionally an amazing two tunnels (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltsADGmrjVQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltsADGmrjVQ</a>). The rest is a shared use path. I now take the lane on this section because so many cars/vans have tried to pass me dangerously. I was seriously thinking of buying a head cam.<p>If you really want to make a change and get people out of cars you need to make the infrastructure you provide safe enough for a 10 year old to cycle it. This means not putting different types of transport in conflict. Have segregated car/cycle/pedestrian lanes. Prioritise cycling over all other forms of transport. Recognise it as a transport 'service' and make it core to government transport policy.<p>This stuff is beginning to happen in the UK. (See London.) Studies are showing the massive benefits to a city (financially) putting in segregated cycling lanes and the long term benefits these bring to companies (cyclists don't have as many days sick). There are also the obvious health benefits.<p>The problem with America is that it loves the car (as does the UK) and is only just beginning to wake up to the fact that converting your city into a massive parking lot just doesn't work and is socially/financially a bad thing.<p>So make it safe enough for a 10 year old to use, design out conflict (seperate out cars/cycles/pedestrians) and put cycling as a priority above everything else.

The article actually understates the problem.<p>Virtually 100% of the contracts in Afghanistan which involve transport are contracted to local vendors.  Those vendors pay off the Taliban to not attack them; this has been known inside the contracting community ~forever, and publicly since at least 2005.  The going rate is about 10-15% of total project expenses; usually it goes from DOD to prime to potentially a sub to a local trucking company to either a relative who is Taliban affiliated, or via a local government/warlord person who is Taliban affiliated.<p>The risk isn't that random contracts are possibly to Taliban front companies; it is that virtually every trucking and logistics operation (except air) funda the Taliban with a substantial percentage of contract amount.<p>For the high dollar contracts, or those with substantial on-base performance requirements (e.g. GD/L-3 supplying IT personnel), the prime contract isn't the issue, but the subsidiary support contracts those contractors sign.  E.g. when they pay for their living trailers to be brought on base, the trucking company is either closely Taliban affiliated, or pays 10-15% of the trailer contract to Taliban.  This means even the big contracts are paying a few percent to the Taliban, indirectly.<p>The issue is that if the US had zero presence in Afghanistan, none of these contracts would exist.  After opium, contracting-related extortion is the major funding source for the Taliban; higher than extortion of the local Afghan economy (other than opium).<p>If we decriminalized [Afghan] opium, either by buying/destroying or buying/medicalizing (or just decriminalizing narcotics worldwide), and pulled out of Afghanistan, there would be no funding to keep the bad guys going.",1365761706
