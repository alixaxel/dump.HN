I keep getting distracted with other things.<p>I expected it to go the 80-20 way, the initial ideas are not new ones, I have been building similar frameworks for a few years.<p>The time is mostly spent on the more difficult problems like &quot;How should operators hang up when the program is closed?&quot; &quot; Should the program be expected to close?&quot; &quot;Should there be a global context object, or a default one&quot; &quot;Should an operator have a window by default or not&quot;<p>There is no right answer, so its just a case of sucking it up and implementing something, seeing if it works, and going from there.<p>Plus the side escapades with earthquakes and space weather and irc channels - although implementing these little things does drive the bigger project.<p>I am hoping before the end of the year I can hit something I feel comfortable slapping &quot;1.0&quot; on and move onto something else for a while and use it as a base for working on some other ideas I have.",1385452779

6799765,comment,6799587,6799587,4,0,10098,,,"> Members of a class in C++ are private by default, but members of a struct are public by default.<p>It&#x27;s not a bug, it&#x27;s a feature. The idea is, you should always prefer private to protected and protected to public (by transitivity, private > public). This is good practice which helps build compact interfaces and maintain encapsulation.<p>Another reason to use &quot;class&quot; is because it&#x27;s OOP terminology. There&#x27;s no notion of &quot;struct&quot; in OOP (in fact, structs shouldn&#x27;t even be there, they&#x27;re an atavism).",1385452206
6799764,comment,6791742,6799382,1,0,vinceguidry,,,"That&#x27;s an application of the Dependency Inversion Principle, part of the SOLID methodology. You always want your code to depend on abstract forms rather than concrete ones. By abstracting database calls into a class, you avoid having to constantly write brittle methods digging deep into concrete implementations.<p>One way your company&#x27;s method might evolve is into the Active Record pattern. You define a class around a particular table, implementing domain logic inside that class. You see this pattern used in Rails. If you&#x27;re using one class per table, I think that&#x27;s the way it will eventually go.<p>I like Active Record ORMs for many applications, but only as a persistence layer. Implementing domain logic in a data class is asking for pain, it violates the Single Responsibility Principle. Each class should do only one thing. The thing handling your data persistence should <i>only</i> read/write to the database, it should not also perform calculations or perform actions on anything other than the database.<p>I refactor domain logic out of models when I see it into Plain Objects with no dependencies, and let the domain have its own abstract world of classes minus ugly database wrappers to play in. I can then write an adapter to the data classes. If it&#x27;s an existing application in production, then at this point I would start to re-design the database, inevitably it will need work.<p>I do this by creating another database schema, generating the data classes, simple as pie now without domain logic getting in the way, then create the adapter from examining the existing one. I can then import all the data from the database, represent it as abstract plain objects, then shoot those objects through the other adapter into the new database.<p>But it only really works if everything does one thing. Your domain objects talk to each other. Your adapter classes go between the domain and the data. The data talks to the database. Achieving this requires hard-won experience with programs that break the principles. You have to feel the pain and recognize where it&#x27;s coming from. No kata will give you this experience.",1385452203

Many dynamic languages store the length of a string buffer, as part of a String object. ie str.length, and it&#x27;s very cheap to query, just an accessor/property/getter.<p>What is misguided in this rant, is the attack against strlen which operates on pointers to zero-terminated strings.

I can&#x27;t speak to his level of competence, but in writing my own game library (mostly for education, but also out of discomfort with tools like Unity) I have found myself ambivalent about visibility and find myself making a lot more stuff public than I otherwise would due to the (wonderful, why oh why don&#x27;t more languages steal this) constness in C++. Constness can often replace private visibility for data--i.e., I don&#x27;t need getters or setters. A field may be immutable once the object is instantiated, in which case I make it a const field, or it may be mutable, in which case the object&#x27;s constness will handle it for me. (There&#x27;s still the case where I need to perform transformations on a piece of data either on the get or the set, of course, and it&#x27;s there that private usability is still of use.)<p>I came to C++ through a circuitous route and a lot of my early C++ is very Java- and Scala-influenced - private vars all over, getters, setters. I find my code becoming much more &quot;public-first&quot; as I get better at what I&#x27;m doing.

And the author cites that use of class is absurd because it makes the default access-specifier &quot;private&quot;, thus leading to more code?<p>Ok for a minute lets consider what this &quot;more&quot; code is. It is simply:\n&quot;public:&quot; when you want to start specifying the public members. You can even do this at the very start if you want ALL members to be public.<p>Now lets compare this to java or C# where (to the best of my knowledge), there isn&#x27;t the ability to say &quot;from here on, all members are private/public&quot; and thus you have to give access specifier with EVERY member.<p>So the author can&#x27;t be bothered to write &quot;public:&quot; once, but is ok writing public with EVERY member?
