6747796,comment,6745412,6746020,1,0,lightblade,,,"This just happened at work like 2 weeks ago. Someone checked in a large (4g) binary file into SVN repo and it crashed the whole system. Everyone at the company was blocked for half a day before they got it fixed (temporarily to unblock everyone). But it took another 2 days and a lot of heated debates between the release manager and devops before everything went back to normal. There were talks about moving to git before the incident, but this really pushed management to finally pull the trigger.\n2 lessons here: 1. SVN is bad at large binary files; 2) centralized source control&#x27;s one way of doing things also gives you one way of disaster recovery.",1384667974
6747795,comment,6747373,6747773,9,0,tw77,,,"You haven&#x27;t brought up any. But some are pretty common. I&#x27;m just arguing that PC prevents free thought and the dispassionate analysis of evidence, since it applies moral values to the evidence itself and it prejudicially strikes out some plausible hypotheses.<p>For example, I don&#x27;t buy that racism is the sole reason for the underrepresentation of some ethnic minority groups in tech because other ethnic minority groups that have been historically oppressed and discriminated against are <i>over</i>represented in tech. But if someone posted an article about how &quot;tech is racist&quot; and I said &quot;I&#x27;m not sure that tech is racist&quot;, then someone could call <i>me</i> a racist and I could lose my job if someone got offended.<p>So anonymity is essential for exploring non-progressive ideas and, I think, for getting closer to truth. There are lots of non-progressive/anti-progressive ideas that are plausible given the available evidence, but nobody will discuss under their real name.",1384667949

It&#x27;s not the kind of &quot;throw&quot; that Java forces you to handle; it&#x27;s more like a null pointer exception, and no, I don&#x27;t put blanket try/catch blocks on every block of code. That would mean writing code that would almost never have coverage, which is a poor practice itself.<p>If the OS handles it transparently, then sure, it could work. But as I understand things, that&#x27;s why the CyanogenMod &quot;feature&quot; of selective permission disabling fails: If I ask whether the Internet has a valid signal, and it unexpectedly throws an error, then my app will either crash or behave in an untested way (depending on whether I&#x27;m catching top-level errors and continuing to run anyway). I don&#x27;t know how the 4.3 feature handles it.<p>I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> users to have the ability to disable Internet, though; not if I&#x27;m writing an ad-supported app. I don&#x27;t want to kill the app on devices that simply never connect to the Internet either, so I&#x27;d prefer if the OS guaranteed that, IF there&#x27;s an Internet connection, it will give me full access to it.",1384667194

Google, according to Wikipedia, has 46,000 employees.  The number of employees who are in a position to influence policy regarding Google+ adoption over the Google suite of products is likely less than one hundred (or .2%).  It is entirely possible -- likely, even! -- that the other 99.8% of those employees do not agree with the Google+ strategy.  It is also entirely possible -- likely, even! -- that those employees are encouraged to voice their opinions internally (though voicing those opinions externally doesn&#x27;t really accomplish anything extra.)<p>2.  You can disagree with Google&#x27;s tactics, motives, and end-goals, but I&#x27;d be hard-pressed to find anyone who doesn&#x27;t believe that the average Google employee is very intelligent.  It is entirely possible -- likely, even! -- that one of these employees did a cost-benefit analysis somewhere along the line (likely before Google+ was released to the public) and discovered that the cost of pushing an umbrella identity (pissing off users, possibly lowering retention and engagement) is outweighed by the benefits of such a strategy (attracting &#x27;whale&#x27; consumers, strengthening advertising profiles for consumers).",1384667181

Much of the commentary in the thread is entirely accurate, and many folks here at HN are pointing out the really funny and really accurate ones...and I&#x27;ve seen some of the same jokes here at HN in the past.

I know it&#x27;s senseless to do so on 4chan (I have more than passing familiarity with the place), but I can hope that HN is willing to consider the cost of continuing thousands of years of oppressive language and behavior and societal norms, and what that means for our community. I think we&#x27;d be better off with more women and people of color and LGBTQ people in our industry; people who casually make sexist, racist, and homophobic jokes do not agree with me, and they express that opinion freely...even here and on reddit, which are merely pseudonymous, casual use of oppressive language and support of oppressive behavior goes unnoticed or encouraged much of the time.",1384666973

However, the Playstation was so insanely popular that Sony had little choice but to tolerate it.<p>I don&#x27;t know what things are like now, but I&#x27;d think that time, the importance of the PS to Sony, and things like the PS3 fiasco (&quot;they can just get a second job to pay for it!&quot;) may have moderated SCE and brought it into the fold somewhat.<p>[Sony&#x27;s other divisions weren&#x27;t perfect, of course, and especially really low-end stuff (e.g. $25 phones) not made in Japan didn&#x27;t really transcend their price-point.  But they&#x27;ve always had a pretty good reputation in general.]",1384666246

But I&#x27;d say, I&#x27;d very much agree with someone in 1850 illegaly helping slaves break free, because he had a &quot;legitimate political cause&quot;.<p>People should care less about what&#x27;s legal and more about what&#x27;s moral. (Admitingly, the second is harder to define. But that&#x27;s the conversation worth to have, instead of just blindy assuming anyone who did something illegal &quot;deserves&quot; jail).",1384664430
