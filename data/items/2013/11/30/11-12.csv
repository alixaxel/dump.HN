One level above that is if the form requires only cutting or tearing. Getting more and more pure is the form known as kirigami, which involves cuts but is made from a single sheet of paper as the base. At the top is origami - no glue, no cuts, only folds (although I&#x27;m not sure if there is such a thing as higher order origami), and ideally only one sheet of paper.</i><p><i>The comparison with functional programming (&quot;no glue and cuts&quot; and &quot;no state&quot;) is so obvious I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;ve never seen it in the wild - maybe because programming has more in common with algebra, whereas origami is geometric?\uFEFF</i><p>Although mostly unrelated to this library, we <i>can</i> conclude that some of the effects in OriDomi should be in a section called KiruDomi. ;)<p>Actually, from a usability perspective, I see a problem with using those effects, like &quot;twist&quot; and &quot;fracture&quot;: once scrambled, it is not obvious from the shape in which way to drag to unfold again, unlike with an effect like &quot;stairs&quot;",1385812077

6822894,comment,6822558,6822871,4,0,antirez,,,"Hello, I&#x27;m not sure I totally get 1 and 2, maybe sometimes you write &quot;cluster&quot; instead of &quot;node&quot;? Btw I&#x27;ll try to reply.<p>1) The amount of connections is not very relevant. You can set a max limit if you want, like with the redis-rb-client that will close old connections before opening new ones if the limit set by the user is less than the number of master nodes. However this is not recommendable as actually what is an idle connection? Just an entry in a data structure of the kernel. So it is not an issue for every client running in a given box to have multiple connections to multiple nodes.<p>2) The limit in the partition resistance in Redis Cluster is a fundamental design trade off, it means no need for a &quot;merge&quot; operation and that in a given moment only one node is responsible for a given key. I think that in the case of Redis most of the times less partition tolerance in favour of a simpler consistency model is what users need.<p>EDIT: a clarification on &quot;1&quot;, what I mean is that every connection will be active only for the subset of keys it holds, so basically the traffic of every client is split across all its connections. Similarly every node of the cluster only performs a percentage of work proportional to the number of hash slots it holds compared to the full set of 16k hash slots.<p>EDIT 2: it is not clear from your point &quot;2&quot; if you understand you can have B2, B3, B4, BN if you want.",1385811386

The odds will be high that the user u1 stores keys on all nodes A,B,C,D since all the keys are based on a numerical hashed slot.<p>1) The user u1 will end up connecting to all nodes.  Thus as you scale adding an &quot;E&quot; you always end up connecting to each cluster having the same amount of connections. Example, let&#x27;s say A,B,C,D have 5k connections open and you add &quot;E&quot;.  Now &quot;E&quot; has 5k connections.  Now you are blocked by the number of requests per second and no amount of hardware can save you.<p>2) Let&#x27;s say B and B1 die. (It happens.)  Now your system is completely out. All 5k connections are blocked.  It would be nice if A,C,D,E continue to run.<p>I usually get around things like this using an index server between user u1 and A,B,C,D. When u1 starts retrieving keys the system needs to be designed such that u1 only connects to single node for it&#x27;s keys.<p>How do you get around 1,2?

6822858,comment,6822578,6822578,2,0,joshmlewis,,,"> we&#x27;ve built a startup that&#x27;s so disruptive, we nearly had an exit within 2 years - but now we&#x27;re about to crash and burn.<p>But what about making money?  Is it so disruptive you haven&#x27;t been able to charge for it yet?  That sounds like a consumer app.  Are you another Instagram? Could you be Snapchat? (snicker)<p>In all reality, either you are so disruptive that you need help finding a way to make money, or you should be able to raise more money if it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s actually adding value.  Something is fishy when your current investors are dropping you after this deal fell through, either the company is in more dire of a situation that you can see, or something else is up.<p>I don&#x27;t know what actual advice to give other than take a close look at what you&#x27;re doing to see if it&#x27;s truly providing value not just &quot;disruptive&quot; and if there is an opportunity to start generating revenue to fund yourself.  That&#x27;s the most obvious solution to a startups cash flow problems.  If you are solving someones pain point, I bet there&#x27;s a few people out there willing to pay for it.",1385809695

6822856,comment,6770785,6770785,1,0,sytelus,,,"Building a model on some training data is easy. Debugging it is <i>hard</i>. Th machine learned model is essentially equivalent of code that gives probabilistic answers. But there are no breakpoints to put or watch to add. When model doesn&#x27;t give the answer you expect, you need to do <i>statistical debugging</i>. Is the problem in training data, do you have correct sampling, are you missing a feature, is your feature selection optimal, does you featurizer have a bug somewhere? Possibilities are endless. Debugging ML model is black art. Most ML &quot;users&quot; would simply give up if model doesn&#x27;t work on some cases or if they added a cool feature but results are not that good. In my experience less than 10% of people who claims ML expertise are actually good at doing statistical debugging and able to identify issue when model doesn&#x27;t work as expected.",1385809652

This merely proves that they&#x27;re actively using their capabilities and that the police doesn&#x27;t really need it; they can just ask another agency.<p>I would assume the same for forcing passwords out of people, something which is still supposed to be illegal in the Netherlands but isn&#x27;t.
