Many companies seem to never be forthcoming with their reasons for doing the things they do.<p>I know this won&#x27;t pay your bills right now, but in a way you can be glad to not be working at the company that didn&#x27;t hire you. If they&#x27;re the kind of company that makes people jump through a bunch of hoops, gives them positive feedback every step of the way and then doesn&#x27;t hire them then it&#x27;s likely not a place you want to work. The tougher situation is when you do go to work at a company like that, and they just arbitrarily hire you and not someone else, and then over the next couple years you have to experience how fucked up their decision make process is.<p>My last company fired one of the other developers shortly after I left; they gave him no advanced warning, no indication that they weren&#x27;t happy with what he was doing, and no honest reason for why they were firing him. They fired a girl from marketing apparently for just being intelligent. They fired another guy from marketing because a few years after they hired him for a marketing job they decided he should suddenly be a coder.<p>You got a small peek into the decision making process at this company you interviewed for. For whatever reason they didn&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be a good fit, and you should now be certain that <i>they</i> weren&#x27;t a good fit for you either.

I watched the whole thing go down and participated in the discussion, including a short correspondence with Steve.<p>The GP is correct in his characterization, as was Steve in his post. Steve had been mulling over the &#x27;forum problem&#x27; for some time, not really sure what to do with it. The discovery of the alternate forum was what finally tipped his hand. There was a sense of betrayal and it pervaded his posts and his actions in the last few days before he killed it.<p>The other forum itself was, as the GP put it, a very private, invite-only community. It remains so to this day. They started it because of a disagreement in how the board was being moderated. Many long-time Pavlina posters were disappointed when very personal posts became fodder for vitriol and they perceived that nothing was being done. After about a year of this, they voted with their feet and went to the new place.<p>I witnessed a very curious dynamic in the last few days. The members Steve was complaining about with the &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; and the members who&#x27;d started the new forum were exactly the same. There were lots of hurt feelings flying around and a lot of things were said that would have been better left unsaid. Steve wielded his ban-hammer with little concern, perhaps because he&#x27;d already decided to shut it all down.<p>I detected a bit of unacknowledged self-serving-ness in Steve&#x27;s blog post concerning the shutdown. Everybody was cool with Steve&#x27;s benevolent dictatorship, but after awhile he&#x27;d just moved on, not posting much if at all. I guess he thought that the king could leave the castle for years and the subjects would just welcome him back with open arms when he finally steps back in and hands out royal decrees. His blog post swept a lot of stuff under the rug, that, honestly, probably should have been, but he didn&#x27;t take responsibility for any of the bad stuff and just pawned it off on the new forum.<p>The situation definitely needed to be rectified, but his handling left a lot to be desired.",1385781485
