The main intrigue of the tournament is the fight between Stockfish and Komodo. Houdini, dominating engine in the last few years, already lost any chances to go into the superfinal -- two very strong challengers, Komodo and Stockfish, in the last few months were able to eat huge advantage of Houdini. The author of Komodo, Don Dailey, is terminally ill, according to his wife he has just a few days to live, so it&#x27;s possible that he will not know if his engine will win or not. It&#x27;s really heartbreaking, he was very active in the chat of TCEC just a few days ago, commenting games, discussing computer chess and so on. Stockfish is an open-source engine that uses distributed testing framework, so anybody can participate in its development donating CPU time [2]. Both engines are very strong and have relatively equal strength.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://tcec.chessdom.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tcec.chessdom.com/</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://tests.stockfishchess.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tests.stockfishchess.org/</a>",1385049495

My personal opinion is that non-game indie devs need a niche, what&#x27;s yours? If you&#x27;re selling to school kids, then find a good hook. For example, public middle schools in California require Spanish fluency. Sell to the parents of those kids perhaps? Or if you&#x27;re going after the international tourist, try to combine the language skills with travel info some how: &quot;We&#x27;ll teach you Spanish before you&#x27;re plane lands!&quot;<p>Also, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not the first one to say it but you&#x27;ve gotta move to iOS7.

I step in, its a mob scene of people dicking around with the apple equipment, highly priced accessories, and this &quot;70&#x27;s basement&quot; stained wood look everywhere. Its kinda boring.  Its like buying a Model T.  Here&#x27;s this mass produced item, they all look kinda the same, and you buy the exact same thing your friends have and off you go.<p>Err, its nice I guess, in a &quot;we&#x27;re kinda different&quot; way, but no where am I thinking its magical or a positive shopping experience.  Staff there tend to be borderline short with me, obviously because they&#x27;re busy with other customers.  Staff at the genius bar look depressed and over-worked. One genius borderline yelled at me when I told him I&#x27;ll need my ac cable back from my imac after service.

6775263,comment,6775067,6775067,13,0,ruswick,,,"In my opinion, Apple receives way too much credit for their retail experience.<p>Going to the Apple Store is almost always an unpleasant experience. First, the small number of locations means that getting to an Apple Store can be onerous. Moreover, the majority of stores are massively overcrowded. On weekends, I literally can&#x27;t get into my local Apple Store because of overcrowding. There are simply too many people to physically navigate the store. Imagine riding a crowded public bus. That is the level of crowding.<p>Moreover, the setup of the Apple Store encourages people to linger and leisurely use the devices. In practice, this means that people (particularly little kids) will spend upwards of thirty minutes playing some asinine game on the display devices. There are no limits enforced, and the chronic overcrowding means that even getting to look at a device is difficult.<p>If you happen to go during a weekday when there isn&#x27;t overcrowding, you get overwhelmed by Apple staff. Effectively every time I enter an Apple Store I get accosted by no less than three employees, not to mention the &quot;concierge&quot; that guards the entryway to the store. When shopping, I don&#x27;t want to be berated by staff. It&#x27;s very reminiscent of the episode of The Office where Dwight gets fired and takes up a position at Staples. When a woman comes into his department to shop, Dwight stands five feet away from her and just glares at her the entire time.<p>Deciding whether or not to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on a device is already mentally taxing; having Apple staff constantly interject does not make the experience any easier. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever heard anyone I know speak positively of an experience at the Apple Store, particularly because they feel absolutely overwhelmed by the way the staff treat them.<p>I&#x27;m not sure if these problems are pervasive or specific only to my local store, but in my experience, the notion that the service at the Apple Store is &quot;magical&quot; is downright laughable.",1385049254

Pre-written &quot;story&quot; is not critical to games, and enabling player creativity is something that will be eagerly received. One person really can make a great game all by themselves in a reasonable amount of time.<p>Amusingly, the only lesson learned by most developers is that people really want block-based worlds. Nah.

There for it is missing the point hugely to bang on about such events being statically insignificant. Such events are negative PR and marketing and have a huge negative emotional response.<p>Or, to ram the point home in a hard, emotional way...

But 25 companies take half of the App Store revenue, leaving only $2.5bn for everyone else.  That means that if you knocked out all 25 of the biggest earners on the App Store, the other 1.25 million apps would see their average annual revenue <i>double</i> to. . . about $4,000 annually.  Hot damn!

The big players - the Apples, the movie studios, the recording studios - certainly don&#x27;t do anything to make it better.  But even without them it&#x27;d still be wretched place to try to make a living, simply because of sheer volume of competition.  There&#x27;s something to be said for having a day job to survive on while you&#x27;re trying to make it.<p>As developers we should count our blessings in that department: unlike for so many other high demand careers, chasing our dreams requires developing skills that are also highly demanded for less glamorous work.  We&#x27;re fortunate to be able to practically default into fantastically lucrative day jobs that still offer reasonably enjoyable work.<p>By which I mean boring corporate jobs.  Working long hours for low pay to go chase somebody else&#x27;s dream at XYZ startup is probably the wrong choice here.  Get the boring 40hr/wk corporate job.

If you know you shouldn&#x27;t win, you are either implying that your opponent may make a stupid mistake that would let you win (an insult to their ability) or you are assuming a right to their time for the mere formality of finishing the game.<p>At a low or mid level of play, it might even make sense to say that you know you should resign, but you&#x27;d like to play it out to see just how the checkmate happens and thus learn more about the game (and giving your opponent that chance to take the resignation rather than assuming you may have their time), but no one is going to learn anything from playing out a losing position at this level of play.",1385047741

6775082,comment,6774015,6774279,8,0,phaker,,,"Sadly DLNA is only for sharing and streaming files. If all you want is playing movies from your laptop, it should work. If you want to play e.g. something from youtube, it will work only if you find a player that supports DLNA. If you want to play a game, it just won&#x27;t work because it&#x27;s not intended for it.<p>Second, while it looks good on paper, last time I&#x27;ve tried even playing movies sucked:<p>* it&#x27;s buggy and &quot;almost, but not really&quot; compatible. Getting a Sony TV to see anything non-Sony took an entire evening. There were no error messages, the only feedback was &quot;it works&quot; vs &quot;it hangs up for 30 seconds and then timeouts&quot;.<p>* Because it&#x27;s build around sharing files, if you want to play a movie you need to make sure it&#x27;s using a codec supported by your TV or it&#x27;ll need to be transcoded it on the fly. Only some DLNA servers support transcoding, user-friendly ones and the servers built into devices often don&#x27;t. Then the only video codec that works reliably with all/most devices is MPEG2 with limited bitrate. There was a small but perceptible loss in quality when playing high bit-rate x264 video.<p>* There&#x27;s a difference between a DLNA &quot;server&quot; and a DLNA &quot;controller&quot;, the &quot;server&quot; serves files, the &quot;controller&quot; is the user interface you use to select a movie to play, play/pause/stop, change volume etc. Many apps support one but not the other. If the app you put on your phone is a &quot;dumb&quot; DLNA server without a controller, then you can select the movies/music/pictures only by navigating the menus on your TV (which hopefully has a controller built in).<p>* All problems have workarounds, but these cause more problems. E.g. in the server i settled on the, transcoding data was  saved to disk to a separate video file that grew and grew until i ran out of disk space. Would you know that before playing a movie you need to make sure you have 100GB of free disk space? Yes, in theory the software could hide all this from me, but it isn&#x27;t there yet and it doesn&#x27;t look like it ever will be.",1385047529

Nobody&#x27;s going to buy a VGA dongle these days.<p>OnLive and Sony/Gaikai are streaming game A/V over the public Internet, and Amazon has a new platform to do it for arbitrary Windows apps.

Further, Wikipedia&#x27;s definition seems to support using the term the way the author does:<p>> a form of active eavesdropping in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them, making them believe that they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker.<p>In the article, the connection is being controlled by the attacker after breaking into and controlling an innocent ISP&#x27;s BGP advertisements.  The attacker also provide a means to route the data back out another connection as well, which implies <i>something</i> was sitting in the middle of the connection grabbing and redirecting data to another connection that hadn&#x27;t had it&#x27;s BGP tables altered.   (If it hadn&#x27;t, the data would have just gone in a loop at the ISP.)<p>In the other cases of BGP &#x27;hijacking&#x27;, the data simply disappeared because it wasn&#x27;t routed back out to the Internets.

Working with those isn&#x27;t so much about saving time, but about making clear statements. I&#x27;m not certain how calling your variable <i>index</i> is better than calling it <i>i</i> - the entire fact that it implied in the construct.<p>I&#x27;m not disagreeing that having decent names is a good idea, just that idioms and convention convey a ton of meaning. For instance if any of my team ever did:<p><pre><code>   def func(self, a, b, c): ...
</code></pre>
There would be a problem. (most of the time anyway...)<p>By analogy: do you always refer to people strictly by full name (that is never calling Robert Smith by Bob, rob, Robert, etc)? Do you always refer to your vehicle as &quot;my $Year $Make $Model&quot; rather than &quot;my car&quot;? Why not? Because it is strictly clearer and easier to do so, with less ambiguity and chance for confusion. I&#x27;m guessing not, because the language you speak in has idioms and constructs that allow shortening this, and understanding is not lost.<p>Basically my point is that assuming the reader of your code is a complete neophyte, with no understanding of common idioms is largely ridiculous, and potentially harmful to the actual neophyte+(small amount of experince) folks because they wonder why the common pattern is not being followed... asking &quot;why is this different? it must be special, not just a for loop...&quot;",1385046563

Kudos to them for finding (or creating) a successful niche with high demand. I find it sad though that sooo much money is going to marketing games that don&#x27;t push technology further, or really fundamentally help things get better.<p>You could argue that if you add up all the marginal increases in utility/happiness that are gained from playing any of the saga games that it might be a net gain, but I think that is a stretch. I find it tragic that this is how the market allocates resources (time and capital).",1385046035
