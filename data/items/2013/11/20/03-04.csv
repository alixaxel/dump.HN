Then undoing a delete action is as easy as flipping the boolean back.  For more complex application state you can keep a stack of state or actions (depending on the application and code) and then push onto the stack as the user performs actions (killing off actions older than a certain point).  When the user hits undo pop from the history stack and push onto a second &#x27;future&#x27; stack to support redo.   I agree with the author that it would be nice if more web apps implemented undo/redo. I Iecently implemented it in an interior design app I was working on and it&#x27;s really not that hard to do.",1384919954

Sure, it&#x27;s got a powered spinning propeller on the front, but it&#x27;s pretty low powered (sub 6A draw at 7.2V - 45W tops) and more importantly I&#x27;ve got _much_ more control of it than people throwing balls or frisbees have - at least once they&#x27;ve left their hands.<p>I&#x27;m happy enough to accept the personal risk of flying this &quot;toy&quot; with the same sort of common sense rules that I&#x27;d use if chucking a ball or frisbee around with friends. Don&#x27;t be reckless, don&#x27;t &quot;buzz&quot; people, try to be obviously taking safety into account. Yeah, there&#x27;s some risk - but a little bit of self control can easily reduce that risk to near-enough-to-zero (and I&#x27;m prepared if required to throw myself on the mercy of a court and argue that I&#x27;d considered and taken prudent precautions to avoid an accident in the case of a truly tragic incident.)<p>A bigger/heavier/more-powerful plane like the one in the OP would affect my decisions about when/where were sensible places to fly - but keep in mind the eBee in the article only weight &quot;less than 700g&quot; - that&#x27;s less than 50% more than a football. Personally, I suspect there&#x27;d be a lot of times/places where other people occasionally kick footballs around that I&#x27;d happily fly a one of them - not without a little extra caution, but given suitable circumstances I&#x27;d fly a ~700g eBee on the same cricket ground as that video of my Mini Swift.",1384919923

6766162,comment,6764102,6765118,4,0,IgorPartola,,,"What a good looking question!<p>The idea is that you want a dual stack environment where IPv4 and IPv6 coexist. Mac, Linux, and Windows all support this and do the right thing: if IPv6 is available on the client and server they try that first, if not they use IPv4.<p>Since you are asking I am assuming your ISP does not provide native IPv6. If you have a public IPv4 address that does not change more frequently than every several hours, the best solution is to set up a 6in4 tunnel (ignore any docs that refer to 6to4, different beast). Sign up for an account at TunnelBroker.net and create a regular /64 tunnel. What this will do is that your router will encapsulate your IPv6 packets inside IPv4 packets and send them to a Tunnel Broker router. That router will then strip the IPv4 header and send the packet off as a pure IPv6 packet. In most cases latency is measured in milliseconds and you might actually see lower latency since IPv6 servers and routes are currently less utilized. YouTube is certainly faster.<p>After you have your account and tunnel set up, it is best to set up your tunnel end point on your home router that supports TunnelBroker.net. Anything that runs OpenWRT does this, as do some commercial router firmware. OpenWRT is great for many reasons so you should use that anyways, this is just a bonus.<p>After your router is able to reach IPv6 hosts (google.com), you would set up and enable a service called radvd (router advertisement daemon) on your router. This will automatically give all the hosts on your LAN instant IPv6 connectivity.<p>Lastly, you would set up an HTTP ping to Tunnel Broker to let it know if your IPv4 address changes. Once again, OpenWRT does this out of the box.<p>I am writing this from my phone, so I cannot provide much specific advice, but email me at igor <at< igorpartola.com and I will answer any specific questions you may have.",1384919090

(My account took its fair share of compromise attempts, too, probably because I use the same username everywhere so it&#x27;s going to be in many modern dev-heavy password dumps.)<p>Github is, for better or worse, a high-value target these days.  Compromise of a Github account will often get you credentials which you can use to compromise high-value targets, for example production machines.<p>(Example from the Rails world: if someone gets read access to your git repository, expect them to figure out your secret token which you use for HMACing sessions to prevent forgery.  If an attacker can forge sessions, they have remote code execution on your production servers.  You can assume they will go directly from code execution to root on those servers, and from root on those servers to a systemic compromise of your entire network (if they want to do that).)<p>Use your imagination on what a mass compromise of accounts gets you.  The simplest possible example is grepping for /bitcoin/, finding the full source code and credentials for a Bitcoin exchange, and rooting them then emptying the hot wallet.  That results in fairly obvious economic advantage, right?  You could also use scriptable attacks to root thousands of big-n-beefy production machines on fairly trusted IP addresses, then add them to a botnet, which you&#x27;d use for spamming or various other nefarious activities.<p>Then, even farther down the list, you have a dedicated adversary actually go through every repository they got access to and look for something uniquely fun to do with that particular target.<p>If you were looking to do industrial espionage on a particular target, you&#x27;d probably pick a way that was less likely to be detected and cause a company-level security response.  (Use passive recon to identify one or a few likely target email addresses, find one or a few likely passwords for them, and try them first.  Heads you win, tails you just left evidence in a log of <i>perfectly normal user behavior</i>.  You might follow up this perfectly normal user behavior with a social engineering attack.)",1384919034

The more each coin is worth, the less big buyers and sellers will impact the overall market.<p>So, if Bitcoin had a total market capitalisation of, say, 10 trilliion, then even big players would only affect a few Satoshi as they buy in and out of the market, therefore the fluctuations would decrease.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s still be people who had held on to their coins from the very beginning, so their leverage on the total market would be big, still.

My license plates were from TX because I never registered in NY; I probably was supposed to, I just never did.<p>The cop pulled me over and was immediately convinced I was running drugs from Canada to TX.  I had been across the border somewhat recenctly, maybe he could see that(?).  I had no previous convictions other than a speeding ticket.  My car was dirty and filled with crap; but I was pretty clean cut and just came out of an office job like 3 minutes earlier.<p>I did in fact have a couple pipes and a couple grams of mid grade bud; and I was dumb and didn&#x27;t insist on my rights and essentially &quot;let&quot; him search my car.  I made my mistake when he found the little jar and I got cocky; as NY had recently decriminalized.. so I just told him to give me the ticket and leave me alone.<p>He promptly arrested me for &quot;driving while ability impaired&quot;; impounded my car, nicked my license, I spent the night in jail, was humiliated, I still can&#x27;t go back to Canada; I had been detained for 3 hours by the time I was given a &#x27;sobriety&#x27; test; I was literally in the police station by then.. reflecting on it, it was clear I was being fucked with; walking a line with my arms spread out, bent ninety degrees at the waist, told to turn around without lifting my feet.<p>I hired the only lawyer I could afford, who basically did nothing but show up for me; paid him 500 bucks and about that in fines; but it has haunted me ever since.. and I was literally 100% sober in every way.  I have never trusted cops since then as a whole; though I have personally come to know a couple that have eased my deep hatred somewhat.<p>My story here I know isn&#x27;t directly related to the article; but it was an extreme abuse of power by a cop exerting his authority over what was genuinely a punk-kid; and I just wasn&#x27;t in a position to do anything about it, both financially and because I didn&#x27;t know then what I know now.",1384917573

Ghost is still in it&#x27;s infancy (version 0.3.3 as of this post), and it still needs plenty of updates in order for it to be a complete &#x27;full-fledged&#x27; platform. Maybe once it stabilizes and has enough built-in features comparable to wordpress will it be a contender, but right now wordpress is the most hassle-free, full-featured website builder out there. You can turn wordpress into a shopping site, a subscription site, etc. but Ghost is still primarily just a blogging platform, which by the way is not a bad thing by any means.<p>The advantage that ghost has is that it built with a newer and much more solid framework, so it&#x27;s not as clunky and has less bugs and security vulnerabilities to deal with (at least for now). The built-in analytics are a nice advantage as well.<p>In any case, I&#x27;m optimistic and excited about the ghost platform. I plan to make a move to ghost within the next coming weeks.

The light creeps all over the room, not just at the direct illuminated spot, as you&#x27;d expect If you were to do a simple camera-trace.<p>The issue at hand is: we don&#x27;t experience it, but light behaves in a thermodynamic (dynamic) equilibrium way. You don&#x27;t see the transients, because the equilibrium takes nanoseconds to converge, but when you turn on a light all your room is exchanging photons until it settles at a rate where everywhere is receiving as much as it&#x27;s irradiating plus what&#x27;s wasted as heat, and the total heat is equal to the energy coming through the light sources. Finding those values is solving the so called light transport  equation -- and this clearly requires probing geometrical information from all over the place.<p>In the sunlit room case, all that light is a) heating the room and b) going outside. Now let me try to build a physical model based on your intuition: this equilibrium dynamic depends on the rate of absorption/reflection of each surface. If you have experience with EE, the room is essentially a resonator, where walls are reflecting some and absorbing some until it&#x27;s absorbing as much as there is light coming in. The less absorbing the walls are, the greater the Q factor of the resonator is: the light is going to bounce a lot and build intensity before it gets absorbed. This is why dark walled rooms are so dramatically, well, darker than white rooms -- the Q factor is not bounded. If your walls were perfect mirrors the intensity would build up with time to +inf.",1384916524
