But in my view, you cannot pitch a privacy solution honestly without disclosing the architecture of your proposed system, and the only practical way for anyone to verify that architecture and your implementation is going to protect privacy is to look at the source code.<p>Of course, you can pitch a solution and be less than 100% transparent about how it works.  And this may be enough to make sales.  But there&#x27;s no way for the customer to really know if you&#x27;re being honest unless they, or their trusted agent, can read and compile the source code.<p>Assuming there are open source alternatives to &quot;cloud&quot; (e.g. peer-to-peer architectures), then maybe there is a market for &quot;privacy consulting&quot; where customers pay consulting fees for the know-how to use open source alternatives to construct data transfer and storage systems that can deliver a level of privacy that the &quot;cloud&quot; architecture cannot.  I don&#x27;t know.  I&#x27;m just thinking out loud.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s good to hear WSJ saying customers are seeking privacy.  The market will no doubt respond.",1385175269

The transfer is immediate. The verification that ensures you aren&#x27;t the victim of double-spend fraud takes an average of 5 minutes (during which they are waiting for their coffee). The transaction will show up as unverified on the blockchain even sooner than that, during which a future merchant could choose to not accept payment until the previous payment clears.<p>Even if they were successful once, the merchant could choose not to sell to them again. Considering the merchant charges on a credit card vs. the low transaction fees of Bitcoin, I would be surprised if Bitcoin didn&#x27;t come way ahead in this scenario.",1385175031

6784993,comment,6780878,6783403,1,0,nilkn,,,"It&#x27;s not weird. The problem is that at some point bitcoins must acquire an unambiguous intrinsic value which is not related so much to their possible future value. If they don&#x27;t, that&#x27;s the definition of a bubble--prices that are considerably higher than intrinsic value.<p>Consider tulip mania from the 1600s. Speculation drove up prices of tulip bulbs to the point where the only people buying tulips were other speculators who were willing to pay the high prices because they thought they could sell it for more later on--the exact reasoning you just posted. Speculators were just trading tulips--or worse, tulip futures--amongst themselves. When the time came to sell the tulips to people who wanted them for decoration, it was discovered that none of them actually valued tulips that much, and the bubble popped.<p>There <i>are</i> arguments for a bitcoin having an intrinsic value of $100k. If bitcoin were ever used for, say, something as large as the real estate market, it would be hard to imagine the price being any lower than that.

(the bad part of that focus is that it would be hard to make you happy - inherent conflict to your utility maximization - antithetical to most males&#x27; online shopping behavior.  mens&#x27; goal of successful shopping is to get in and get out whereas for women it&#x27;s to get in and get lost, hence why pinterest and wanelo is 80+% females... and investors in the valley were like &quot;wtf. why would anyone use this pinterest thing&quot;). ironically pinterest and wanelo both had walls to sign up for well over the initial inflection point (albeit i admit much better transparency than what my site provided - so maybe the solution is i allow users to get a glimpse of the site. the way i define business = why would you come to my site to continue to browse each and every day for cool unique lifestyle products (similar to browsing a magazine). if you do that there are numerous way to monetize besides transaction especially as i am focused on providing an omni-channel solution to local shopping experience. online discovery is just the beginning steps.<p>3) this brings me to &quot;non-targeted product pictures.&quot; i can easily create a STYLEseek DNA game and set you as a certain type of user and give you exactly that type of items. you definitely don&#x27;t have to be MIT kids to figure that simple algo out. however, FANCY with 10m users and 600m valuation has proven that that is not what aspirational lifstyle/tastemaker types like to do when they browse/shop.  they like to a) sift through and collect their own, b) get lost into pages c) get introduced to new things in lifestyle/fashion that&#x27;s happening.  if you ask a girl to go on styleseek after 5 min they&#x27;ll say i&#x27;m bored. if you ask a girl to use urban daddy to find bars they&#x27;ll say this sucks bc &quot;i don&#x27;t get lost&quot; that is why refinery 29 and bustle are all geared toward women getting lost in content that is loosely connected. at reppio, we connect by style tags. we&#x27;ve curated the initial set but if you want you can filter by style tags. otherwise, my counterargument is what&#x27;s the difference between going on styleseek vs going to my favorite niche blog or just nordstrom.com? too much targeted discovery actually diminishes value to certain type of shoppers (majority of women and trendsetting men).<p>it&#x27;s becoming clearer and clearer how hard the fusion is to accomplish and how tight in consequence the curation has to get. so perhaps you didn&#x27;t like it because our curation wasn&#x27;t tight enough. if you look at wanelo and why after wanelo already conquered social commerce for young females, keep popped up (this founder is not stupid by any means), you can tell that the curation is tighter on keep.<p>4) i would like to explain important of discovery. yes you can walk down the street. nyc has 2,000 mens&#x27; shops by the way - 90% crap. are you sure you know all of them? my partners and i spent over 10 years reading every fashion lifestyle magazine bc that is what we love doing and so yes i do know most of them.  the chicago shops on our platform - they are not on michigan ave. they are spread out all over the city but still regarded as some of the best mens&#x27; shops in the country. there is opportunity cost of time and convenience built into the value proposition whether it online/offline shopping.<p>also the vision is not 3 cities. we&#x27;re rolling out SF and Miami in 3 weeks.  The goal is to aggregate all of the major cities around the world that&#x27;s amazing for local shoppping. so how would you shop at tokyo&#x27;s best paper denim jeans boutique or sao paolo&#x27;s best sunglass shop? you can&#x27;t. only at reppio will you be able to. that&#x27;s exclusive access. that&#x27;s convenience afforded by hyper local aggregation at a global scale. london, paris, hong kong, buenos aires, syndey, and montreal, and all the major shopping cities are plugged into a single platform with a single checkout process / no language translation and integrated user experience.<p>5) lastly, great point on SSL. very helpful.<p>hope i was able to answer some questions you had about the platform. let me know if you had any counter-points / other faults you saw with the product. thanks!",1385174282

In the first was just too time consuming (more than 3 hours) and I stopped working on it because I felt it was taking too much time, and the second was on-site without an internet connection where when I drew a blank on using setInterval, and couldn&#x27;t remember document.getElementsByClass (I was trying getElementByClass) I was unable to look-up the answer, which basically meant I had to sit there wracking my brain trying to remember and completely failed a test which would have been a walk in the park otherwise.<p>At the same time, the two companies that I&#x27;ve chosen to work for have not asked for coding challenges. My current employer did look at my GitHub profile, I don&#x27;t think my previous employer did.<p>I think that supplying sample code should be enough for most employers, hopefully there is a way to confirm the applicant wrote the code they are taking credit for (I&#x27;ve had somebody claim to build one of my sites before, so it&#x27;s happened. I got a bunch of e-mails by people asking me for a reference).<p>Another good way for businesses to decide on a coding question (if they decide to do one at all) is to take questions from larger successful technology businesses. I had one company ask me to complete one of the questions from Spotify <a href=\"https://www.spotify.com/au/jobs/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.spotify.com/au/jobs/</a>, it didn&#x27;t take very long at all (may 40 minutes) and if it is good enough for Spotify, it is probably good enough for your company.",1385172178

Nobody that I can find has ever pointed out any regulatory hurdles for Baltimore FIOS, so if you make that claim, it would be nice to actually back it up.",1385172109

As your article states, properly installed knob and tube is at least as safe as modern wiring.<p>The major problem is that since knob and tube lost favor and today, demand for electricity within the home has grown considerably, and a lot of knob and tube systems were expanded improperly; this can happen with modern wiring as well.  Also, the insulation issue.",1385172092
