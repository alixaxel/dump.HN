6784731,comment,6783499,6783998,3,0,c0nfused,,,"So, a bit of a rant, I dislike the current game culture meme of &quot;this engine is poorly optimized&quot;. I am tired of seeing the following statement: game x is poorly optimized because game y runs better on my box. This is akin to saying: I find apples delicious, Oranges are terrible. Get apples noobs.<p>I would argue that the fact that you can drop in any one of a half dozen solid engines based on your programming language of choice speaks to the fact that they are commodities. At this point, for the vast majority of cases, it makes as much sense to write a 3d game engine as it does to write your own web server.<p>You can do it, but you could spend the time doing something that directly relates to the product you want to sell instead.",1385168372

The fact that resources are drawn from stack, heap and mechanical storage device, and the existence of rules for choosing which is appropriate, only tells us how primitive modern languages are.<p>Mathematics might stand as a counterexample (of a universal language) if it were easier to use for programming -- but that problem is being addressed, and computer languages become more like mathematics as time passes.",1385168078

Your language will not work.  Here is why it will not work.\n    \n    You appear to believe that:\n    [ ] Syntax is what makes programming difficult\n    [ ] Garbage collection is free                [ ] Computers have infinite memory\n    [ ] Nobody really needs:\n        [X] concurrency  [X] a REPL  [X] debugger support  [X] IDE support  [ ] I/O\n        [X] to interact with code not written in your language\n    [ ] The entire world speaks 7-bit ASCII\n    [ ] Scaling up to large software projects will be easy\n    [ ] Convincing programmers to adopt a new language will be easy\n    [ ] Convincing programmers to adopt a language-specific IDE will be easy\n    [ ] Programmers love writing lots of boilerplate\n    [ ] Specifying behaviors as &quot;undefined&quot; means that programmers won&#x27;t rely on them\n    [X] &quot;Spooky action at a distance&quot; makes programming more fun\n\n    Unfortunately, your language (has/lacks):\n    [-] comprehensible syntax  [-] semicolons  [+] significant whitespace  [-] macros\n    [+] implicit type conversion  [-] explicit casting  [-] type inference\n    [+] goto  [-] exceptions  [-] closures  [-] tail recursion  [-] coroutines\n    [-] reflection  [-]

philosophical objections apply:\n    [ ] Programmers should not need to understand category theory to write &quot;Hello, World!&quot;\n    [ ] Programmers should not develop RSI from writing &quot;Hello, World!&quot;\n    [ ] The most significant program written in your language is its own compiler\n    [X] The most significant program written in your language isn&#x27;t even its own compiler\n    [ ] No language spec\n    [ ] &quot;The implementation is the spec&quot;\n       [ ] The implementation is closed-source  [ ] covered by patents  [ ] not owned by you\n    [ ] Your type system is unsound  [ ] Your language cannot be unambiguously parsed\n       [ ] a proof of same is attached\n       [ ] invoking this proof crashes the compiler\n    [X] The name of your language

understands English is AI-complete\n    [ ] Your language relies on an optimization which has never been shown possible\n    [ ] There are less than 100 programmers on Earth smart enough to use your language\n    [ ] ____________________________ takes exponential time\n    [ ] ____________________________ is known to be undecidable\n    \n    Your implementation has the following flaws:\n    [ ]

conflicts in parsing seem to be resolved using rand()\n    [X] You require the compiler to be present at runtime\n    [ ] You require the language runtime to be present at compile-time\n    [X] Your compiler errors are completely inscrutable\n    [X] Dangerous behavior is only a warning\n    [X] The compiler crashes if you look at it funny\n    [X] The VM crashes if you look at it funny\n    [X] You don&#x27;t seem to understand basic optimization techniques\n    [ ] You don&#x27;t seem to understand basic systems programming\n    [ ] You don&#x27;t seem to understand pointers\n    [ ] You don&#x27;t seem to understand functions\n    \n    Additionally, your marketing has the following problems:\n    [ ] Unsupported claims of increased productivity\n    [ ] Unsupported claims of greater &quot;ease of use&quot;\n    [ ] Obviously rigged benchmarks\n       [ ] Graphics, simulation, or crypto benchmarks where your code just calls\n           handwritten assembly through your FFI\n       [ ] String-processing benchmarks where you just call PCRE\n       [ ] Matrix-math benchmarks where you just call BLAS\n    [X] Noone really believes that your language is faster than:\n        [X] assembly  [X] C  [X] FORTRAN  [X] Java  [X] Ruby  [X] Prolog\n    [X] Rejection of orthodox programming-language theory without justification\n    [ ] Rejection of orthodox systems programming without justification\n    [ ] Rejection of orthodox algorithmic theory without justification\n    [ ] Rejection of basic computer science without justification\n    \n    Taking the wider ecosystem into account, I would like to note that:\n    [X] Your complex sample code would be one line in: almost anything, actually\n    [ ] We already have an unsafe imperative language\n    [ ] We already have a safe imperative OO language\n    [ ] We already have a safe statically-typed eager functional language\n    [ ] You have reinvented Lisp but worse\n    [ ] You have reinvented Javascript but worse\n    [ ] You have reinvented Java but worse\n    [ ] You have reinvented C++ but worse\n    [ ] You have reinvented PHP but worse\n    [ ] You have reinvented PHP better, but that&#x27;s still no justification\n    [ ] You have reinvented Brainfuck but non-ironically\n\n    In conclusion, this is what I think of you:\n    [ ] You have some interesting ideas, but this won&#x27;t fly.\n    [X] This is a bad language, and you should feel bad for inventing it.\n    [X] Programming in this language is an adequate punishment for inventing it.\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, it was so magnificently

I sat through the whole trial, and up until the judge was mid-way through his ruling, I had no idea which way he was going to rule. But suddenly I realized, despite the measured prose of the decision and the unraised voice reading it, that the judge was <i>pissed</i>. He felt the whole thing was a giant waste of time, and that any lawyer who wasn&#x27;t a complete fuckup would have kept the case from turning up in his courtroom. And it wasn&#x27;t just me that realized it; we all watched the plaintiff&#x27;s lawyer slowly wilt.<p>It was an incredible thing to watch. The formality of the occasion, the power of the judge, the power of the system he represented, the normal range of courtroom expression: they all set a context in which a slightly raised eyebrow was more powerful than the loudest shout, that arch deprecation was more cutting than a raft of verbal abuse.<p>I expect it&#x27;s the same deal here.

Let me explain:<p>Inflation has never been a problem since Paul Volcker in 1982. In fact, the moniker Great Moderation should be more properly called Great Moderation of Inflation -- since not much was moderate apart from that, as exemplified by the crashes of 1987 and 2008, and the bubbles; but I digress.<p>We had about 10, 20 years of the lowest level of inflation in history across the board, maybe 2% per annum or so. Everyone nowadays is obsessed with Zimbabwe, or the ex-Soviet Unions, or the Diocletian Roman Empire, but those are red herrings, minor blips in a sea of (excessive) financial restraint. Inflation is not a problem today.<p>In fact, <i>deflation</i> is a problem today. Large part of the German restructuring, so lauded everywhere, was helped by inflation in Spain and Italy. (Granted, it wasn&#x27;t much, maybe 4% per year, but even so.) Now the ECB refuses to return the favor: the ECB won&#x27;t let inflation go above 2%, twisting the knife in Southern Europe&#x27;s rib-cage and pissing everyone off. Meanwhile, the US, as most of the West and Japan, remains eyeballs deep in a liquidity trap: you could print the equivalent of the Michigan Lake in one dollar bills, and the Consumer Price Index wouldn&#x27;t register a blip.<p><i>If</i> your start-up were a big bank, you could tomorrow borrow money from the government at a <i>real negative rate</i>. You could borrow a billion dollars, store it in a bank account, pay in 10 years the principal and profit handsomely with the interest. For nothing. That&#x27;s how low inflation is, today. The Fed is (used to be) desperately trying to increase it, as we speak, with not much effect.<p>In economic terms, a moderate (actually very low, in historical terms) 4% rate across the board would in fact benefit the system. If you can profit decently by storing money, nobody wants to get their lazy asses from the couch and invest. And the guys who have money don&#x27;t want to spend it, either -- they&#x27;re winning money, why spend? Thus a crisis.

If you had $150 million in rubles, you could transfer it for only a nominal fee ($20 for my bank, although you can get a lot cheaper if you regularly did transfers like that) to any account in the world that could hold rubles.  Exactly the same with bitcoin.<p>The only real cost in transferring sums of money is either extreme convenience, transferring to a country with an extremely poor banking service or exchanging currencies.  None of which bitcoin solves yet.",1385164925
