If you&#x27;re talking about waiting for your transaction to be included in the next block, it could even take longer than that by chance. Those restaurant merchants should just accept on the incoming notice which is very quick. There are precautions a merchant can take to make a race attack double-spend harder, but most people are honest and the threat is similar to a person dining and dashing. For large transactions, sure, wait at least 1 confirm and preferably 6 or more, but for a $20 or less meal? If you want to bust them you have the timestamp of the bad transaction, and you can look at your security camera logs.",1385697561

You can endlessly debate the value or the intelligence of your work when it&#x27;s behind closed doors. Getting this work in front of other people simplifies this a bit I think.<p>Writing which never sees the light of day becomes far more valuable the instant it is accessible to others. The same is true for anything you create. Simply creating a blog post produces value when others read it. The key here is creating and shipping. Otherwise it just rots unseen and it might as well be some virtual thing in your head driving you crazy.<p>Often just doing something helps a lot. I have a friend who has horrible at photography eventually become an awesome professional photographer. I watched his progression on Flikr over the years. He started out taking a crazy number of the worst pictures I have seen. He took pictures of anything and everything and posted them all. As time went on, he posted fewer pictures but with increasingly better quality. Today, I find his pictures to be stunningly beautiful.<p>I have seen the same with writers and of things I do every day as well.<p>Just create stuff. Get it out there and don&#x27;t dwell too much on how good it is. Let other people do that for you while you continue building. It&#x27;s a release. You feel better getting it out there. You know you have done something because your creation is at a point where people are consuming it. If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s valuable enough, then build something else. Just keep going. Don&#x27;t hold it in your head or you will go crazy.",1385697526

I cringe any time someone labels something a &quot;superfood&quot;, as that means they are likely to encourage eating it far beyond the point where it is healthy. I also cringe any time a dietary recommendation to remove a major macronutrient (fat, carbs) from your diet; that tends to lead to extreme compensation with something else, which can also be unhealthy.<p>And this is also why I cringe about the hype over Soylent. We really don&#x27;t know all that much about nutrition. We are constantly discovering new things about it; it&#x27;s an incredibly complex topic, the way our body interacts with different things that we eat. Coming out with a product that you&#x27;re encouraging people to replace their entire diet with, and saying that it&#x27;s safe because you have personally tested it for a couple of months, is insane. A lot of these kinds of effects can only be seen after years, or only impact 10% of the population, or the like.<p><pre><code>    &quot;In today&#x27;s supermarkets,&quot; he says, his voice weary, \n    &quot;you can&#x27;t hardly get anything without at least some soy \n    in it.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s funny that he says this. I eat very little soy, unless I&#x27;ve chosen to in the form of tofu or soy sauce. How do I manage this? By only buying things that don&#x27;t need ingredient lists because they are a single ingredient. If you buy fresh produce, meat, flour, eggs, etc. and actually cook yourself, you can easily control what&#x27;s in your diet. Don&#x27;t buy prepackaged instant meals that you&#x27;ll need to inspect the ingredient list of, and you&#x27;ll be fine.<p>Anyhow, I&#x27;m sure that after articles like this, people will start doing the extreme reaction again, of &quot;soy free&quot; everything, replacing with something else that has some other potential health problem. Soy, in moderation, causes no problems for the vast majority of people. This guy is a special case, due to both his sensitivity and the extreme amount he consumed, replacing much of his protein intake with soy.",1385696141

6817766,comment,6815480,6816646,2,0,chilldream,,,"The thing is, it&#x27;s not just an overload; it&#x27;s an overload <i>and</i> a typecast. Those are two separate questions, and OP is really complaining about the typecast, not the overload.<p>The ints vs. floats thing is kind of a red herring. In that specific case, at least you&#x27;re still talking about numbers. The argument against having contagion for 5 + 5.5, and overloading for &quot;5&quot; + &quot;5.5&quot;, but throwing an exception for &quot;5&quot; + 5.5 is that the first is a pair of numeric types, the second is a pair of strings, but the third is a pair of unrelated types. You can say white is lighter than black, and a feather is lighter than an anvil, but you can&#x27;t say that white is lighter than an anvil because that&#x27;s nonsense.<p>Incidentally, this is why, say, Python and Ruby (and I imagine Lisp) people insist upon the distinction between dynamically typed and weakly typed. If I fire up a node.js repl, I find that &#x27;50&#x27; + 5 is &#x27;505&#x27;, but &#x27;50&#x27; - 5 is 45, and am reminded why JavaScript drives me nuts. In the extreme you get things like [this](<a href=\"http://phpmanualmasterpieces.tumblr.com/post/33198366857/layers-of-mistaken-like-an-ogre\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://phpmanualmasterpieces.tumblr.com/post/33198366857/lay...</a>) and [this](<a href=\"https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat</a>). I realize that Java probably doesn&#x27;t do anything near that bad, but the point is that it&#x27;s a question of balancing convenience vs. error prevention, and that we&#x27;re talking about a very strictly-typed language which will naturally attract people who tilt toward wanting the error detection, and even dynamic languages that swing the other way on most things often find that you don&#x27;t need to make your math operators cast numbers into non-numeric types (and risk the resulting runtime errors) to have convenient string handling.<p>In fact, I think Ruby&#x27;s string interpolation is actually a better syntatic sugar than Java&#x27;s `+` cat overload. Consider that I want to print a string along the lines of &quot;1 + 5 = 6&quot; but with arbitrary integers. Here&#x27;s how it might look in Ruby:<p><pre><code>    puts &quot;#{x} + #{y} = #{x+y}&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s hard to imagine a syntax much better than this, especially for short strings, since the shape is basically identical to the string it&#x27;s creating.<p>Python 3 is less pretty, but still reasonable:<p><pre><code>    print(&quot;{} + {} = {}&quot;.format(x, y, x+y))\n    print(x, &quot;+&quot;, y, &quot;=&quot;, x+y)\n</code></pre>\nMeanwhile, neither Ruby nor Python makes you declare types as a rule. In fact, one of the non-backward compatible changes in Python 3 was to make it so that 1/2 returns .5, since that&#x27;s how numbers work and it&#x27;s probably what you meant (there are still ways to specify integer division if you want). However, in either language, if you write &quot;5&quot; + 5, they will raise a ValueError because that doesn&#x27;t actually mean anything, is likely to be a bug, and is always easily rewritten in a concise but less ambiguous way. Speaking of which:<p>> have no potential to mean something else than what the programmer meant<p>is just false. There is a very obvious way for it to mean something other than what the programmer wanted: When the programmer forgot to cast a string to a number and tried to add it to a number. This is particularly a risk in dynamic languages or those using type inference (it&#x27;s harder to pull off in languages where you have to explicitly declare all your variable types, which may make it a non-issue in Java speficially).",1385695978

It sounded promising but it failed and everyone had to be refunded.<p><a href=\"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=330209.0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=330209.0</a><p>In fact, the reason the BTC price on Mt.Gox is so high is because you can&#x27;t get your money off there in a reasonable amount of time. This means that to get your money off of Mt.Gox you do not send a sell order to convert to USD, you instead transfer the BTC to an external wallet and sell it elsewhere. This leads to more buy orders than sell orders on Mt.gox (leading to higher BTC/USD prices).",1385694956
