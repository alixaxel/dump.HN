It is obvious to me that some interpretations of the guidelines would justify banning me - if all mentions of sexism or other issues of inclusiveness constitute &quot;flame war bait&quot;, then of course my comments would fall into that category. It seems to me that banning all such comments is counterproductive, but I can&#x27;t figure out a narrower reading that would explain why I was banned. Neither comment was especially rude or sarcastic, at least no moreso than what I frequently see in threads here, and I feel both comments contributed to the discussion.

6752774,comment,6750082,6750082,6,0,mrmaddog,,,"Once you do decide to use an assert in python, there are a couple things to consider. The first is to make sure you are expressive in your message. Your assert may very well hit one day, and it may only occur at the most unpredictable times, so you&#x27;ll want to make sure you have enough information to see <i>why</i> the assert failed. To use the OP&#x27;s example:<p><pre><code>  assert x > 0, &quot;x is not zero or negative&quot;\n</code></pre>\nWhen this fails, you&#x27;re going to be at a loss to understand what actually happened. If you change the message to something like the following, you&#x27;re going to have a much easier time tracing through your program to understand why your constraint was violated:<p><pre><code>  assert x > 0, &quot;Expected positive x, got: %d&quot; % x\n</code></pre>\nOnce you get in the habbit of this, you&#x27;ll quickly run up against style-guide imposed line limits. My usual trick here is to use parenthesis and let python&#x27;s automatic string concatenation work its wonders, but you have to be careful because<p><pre><code>   assert (x > 0, &quot;This is my longer message &quot;\n           &quot;for x&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nevaluates to a tuple, and thus is always true. Instead only use parens around the message:<p><pre><code>   assert x > 0, (&quot;This is my longer message &quot;\n                  &quot;for x&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nLastly, don&#x27;t use asserts in tests. Use the standard unittest library which will do a much better job explaining what was received, what was expected, and what the difference between them is.",1384752943

If everyone were legally on the hook for the work they produced, it would be like assuming that everyone you ever hire is required to be omniscient. The reality is, you can&#x27;t hire someone with a 50 IQ and then sue them because you believe one of their lines of code hurt your profitability. It&#x27;s your fault for hiring them.<p>I gotta say a lot of these responses I&#x27;m getting are very paranoid. When a company pays you for work it&#x27;s really hard for them to take that away from you. The most that&#x27;s ever really at stake is your current paycheck and not even that really because the department of labor is VERY harsh on reputable employers who deny paychecks.<p>It seems like your point is more of a fantasy scenario where they give you a billion dollars & 5 years of unsupervised time to design a huge blackbox program that has to do X, then find out it doesn&#x27;t do X. The software industry is simply not like this. All tasks are broken up into discrete components and if you&#x27;re not doing a good job they&#x27;ll fire you and bring in a new team to finish the job.<p>The ONLY way I&#x27;ve actually heard of an employee losing $$ is when they have a long-term employment agreement and they break it. It&#x27;s kindof like an athlete signing a 10-year deal & walking off the field after 6 months. Then, yes, you&#x27;re liable.<p>Otherwise being a paid consultant is pretty much the same thing as being an employee. Also, I doubt that companies will sign some &quot;boilerplate contract&quot; that absolves you of all liability. They&#x27;d rather hire someone who is more confident. That&#x27;s not a dig, I really mean that sincerely. Over-negotiating and specifying a bunch of &quot;unrealistic-covering-my-ass-terms&quot; can come off as amateur.",1384751214
6752672,comment,6751710,6751710,13,0,Lazare,,,"Here&#x27;s an interesting hypothetical.<p>Step 1:  User A purchases a shrinkwrapped DVD with excellent packaging from a counterfeiter in China.<p>Step 2:  User A sells the DVD to an FBA merchant, who forwards it on to Amazon.<p>Step 3:  User B buys the DVD from Amazon; due to commingling they get the counterfeit DVD.  Before they can open it they get hit by a bus.<p>Step 4:  User B&#x27;s executors sell the DVD back to an FBA merchant, who forwards it on to Amazon without a second thought (since it&#x27;s a shrinkwrapped DVD straight out of Amazon&#x27;s warehouses.<p>Step 5:  User C purchases the DVD from the FBA merchant, opens it, and finds its counterfeit.<p>In short, the FBA/commingling stuff means that merchandise you buy directly from Amazon can be untrusted.  In turn that means that, as an FBA merchant, even merchandise that came directly from Amazon can be untrusted.  Any shrinkwrapped DVD that has passed through an Amazon fulfillment warehouse is actually of entirely unknown provenance; it could have been purchased at a stall in Shanghai for all you know.  And if your business relies on never selling a counterfeit DVD, then that means nothing you buy <i>or</i> sell can ever touch an Amazon warehouse.<p>I doubt this is a real concern (this is the first I&#x27;ve heard of any issues with counterfeiting and FBA), but it&#x27;s still an interesting structural flaw.  Given Amazon&#x27;s volume, they&#x27;re probably shipping out multiple counterfeit DVDs right now, under their own shipping label as well as that of various FBA merchants.<p>Fascinating.",1384751205
