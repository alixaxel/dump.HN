Second line completely false.<p>One side of the argument is virtually all of the users are a multicultural swath of humanity, mostly adults.<p>The other side of the argument is the largest unicultural subgroup of users was in 2006 HS/Uni kids, maybe as much as 5% of total users.  The key being they were the largest single unicultural group.<p>Both arguments are simultaneously true.  There is no point repeating the two true statements to the &quot;opposite&quot; side.<p>If you prefer a numerical argument, you&#x27;ve got 1K subgroups with 1K members each with little overlap, and one 10K member subgroup.  The vast majority of the 1010K members are not in the 10K subgroup but are members of one of many 1K sized subgroups, and it is also simultaneously true that one subgroup is 10x the size of every other subgroup.",1384783147

Ok, then.<p>My position is that we do need the state, but we need to inject a lot more realism (ie cynicism) about what what government can realistically do (not to mention, do well) into the debate in order to get to a better place.<p>EDIT: I suspect that you might be referring to my comments on different posts. I find that arguing the libertarian point of view is a useful method of injecting the mentioned realism. Do I find the stateless society appealing? Yes, in theory, as a construct to debate the extreme consequences of ideas. It&#x27;s a rewarding intellectual exercise to consider how justice might work without the state. But I&#x27;m no utopian and I have no illusions about the extreme dangers of revolution. So my &quot;real world&quot; political contributions is in the space of injecting more cynicism into the democratic process in the hope of inspiring more people to avoid reflectively turning to the state to mend their ills and consider, for an example, technological solutions instead.",1384782979

The twentieth century shows the contrary. Human beings use the power of scientific knowledge to assert and defend the values and goals they already have. New technologies can be used to alleviate suffering and enhance freedom. They can, and will, also be used to wage war and strengthen tyranny. Science made possible the technologies that powered the industrial revolution. In the twentieth century, these technologies were used to implement state terror and genocide on an unprecedented scale. Ethics and politics do not advance in line with the growth of knowledge — not even in the long run.&quot;</i>",1384782924

People would read the whole thing, try and understand the issue, and talk about it.<p>As reddit has grown, thoughtful posts have been replaced by one liners and memes. The front page is mostly just a dumping ground for whatever is viral at the moment.<p>I think this, interestingly, mirrors what happened to democracy in the United States. The democracy that the founding fathers imagined was one run mostly by the educated few, with everyone else also having the ability to voice their concerns.<p>What its turned into now is a chaotic mess of talking points and rhetoric, with two factions on opposite sides just screaming the same things at each other.<p>I think its because the more people you get involved in decision making, the simpler you have to make the case for each potential choice in order for the most people to be able to understand it. People will choose an inferior choice that they can understand over a superior one that they can&#x27;t.<p>And the problem then is that oftentimes the most important things are the things that are hardest to understand.",1384782777

A good market for this might be help desks, or small startups that offer round-the-clock support.  Round-the-clock support usually means at least one person per shift, and small startups don&#x27;t generally have a lot of overlap there -- so they have an increased need for quickly findable knowledge, which means that they need knowledge management.<p>Target that, or something like it.  If you can niche further, do it -- if that niche gets traction, expand it slightly.  If it doesn&#x27;t, change it altogether.

Ultimately, image reproduction is about controlling perception and human brightness perception is non-linear.<p>You should do any calculations in linear space (and possibly with a temporarily higher bit depth) but a linear display would not be desirable.<p>Imagine having a room with 10 independently controlled LEDs of equivalent brightness to a 10-watt incandescent lightbulb. Try to visualize the difference from going from 0 (pitch black) to 1 light, to 2, and then imagine 9->10. If you try this IRL you will notice that human brightness perception is very non-linear. To get the most bang per light switch, we need to make the later lightbulbs brighter to get the same punch. This is what monitors do with their bit depth.<p>It makes good sense for human perception to be non-linear: Earth has a very wide range of brightnesses we need to live in, and the difference in information we can acquire from being out in the sun vs. in the shade is not commensurate with the difference in brightness.<p>If you are in a very, very dark place (not a city at night) you will experience a very distinct non-blackness.

Enormous amounts of fear (understandable) and utter disgust-filled loathing (not so much). There were politicians calling for AIDS sufferers to be rounded up and put in quarantine camps but refusing to engage in public health initiatives because they thought that warning people to use condoms and engage in safe sex would &quot;promote&quot; homosexuality.<p>Up until 2010 in Britain, it was legal for a dentist to refuse to take an HIV+ patient even though the professional association for dentists had told dentists that it was safe to use the same procedures around sterilisation and safety. It also made no sense as it just led to people lying about their HIV status to dentists in order to get access to health services.<p>I know people who have faced discrimination in work over chronic mental health conditions that they are being treated for. People who have held down other jobs perfectly well, who take less sick leave than people without any health conditions. There is still significant social stigma around mental health conditions: nobody considers you morally suspicious if you have, say, eczema or hay fever, but if you have depression or schizophrenia, some will consider you too &quot;risky&quot; to employ etc.<p>So, yes, &quot;please make all your medical records public&quot; sounds nice.

So I would like to know specifically why they don&#x27;t help and turned out so bad in Spain.<p>Sure, the State generally won&#x27;t fight against itself, but I think that he makes a good point though about not just completely giving up.  I mean I have given up on politics like a lot of people, but when I was reading that article it made me think that if enough people tried, we _could_ make some improvements and help at least ease the adoption of technologies that solve structural/political problems.<p>There are a lot of people, especially in the US, that are really looking toward social democracy (socialism) as the light at the end of the tunnel.  I think that its unfortunate that there isn&#x27;t a better perspective for these people on the realities of social democracies in Europe or of the historical context of socialism.  However, with such extreme inequality, its hard not to lean in that direction in one&#x27;s thinking.<p>I actually think the key problems are over-centralization, which occurs both in capitalistic societies and socialist societies to a high degree, as well as a lack of social and physical science being incorporated into decision making.  The communist/socialist ideal especially overcentralizes although it does a better job of incorporating hard science into decision making.  In that case the main problem is lack of distribution of decision-making and diversity of solutions which stifles evolution of the system.<p>The capitalistic ideal especially lacks the input of hard social and physical sciences although it does provide a diverse set of solutions, at least until monopoly takes over.  We need to measure human and ecological well-being and incorporate different scientifically motivated attempts to improve those holistic measurements into our various enterprises.<p>Technology is going to be incredibly powerful in moving away from centralization which should directly impact human well-being and inequality.",1384780334

Using a larger person icon like the one used on Mac OS X user accounts icon in the System Preferences is better. Mac OS X uses two people&#x27;s busts to signify plurality but a single person is better suited here. After that place the white @ symbol on the users chest right below a T-shirt&#x27;s neckline. This way the significance of it being a personal item is not lost in translation while the @ symbol advertises the purpose of the icon. A person&#x27;s icon that doesn&#x27;t show arms is also easier to manifest in a 16x16 pixel icon. Furthermore it would be better to use a gender neutral head outline.<p>All things considered, good proposal.",1384780183

Youtube became a household name in 2005 after the Lazy Sunday video, with much fanfare, was published on the service and it became essentially the defacto place to watch it.<p>I&#x27;m inclined to believe that productions by kids maintained the interest in the service beyond that point, but it was content produced by adults that popularized it in the first place. With possibly the exception of Facebook, I think you could say the same about most social networking services. Twitter only became interesting to the general public after adult celebrities started contributing. Myspace was popularized by adults promoting their musical groups.<p><i>> What is Facebook lacking?</i><p>A monopoly on photo sharing. Anyone who can take that traffic away increases the risks of taking people away from Facebook completely, and that is a huge risk for them. The insane valuations for these companies (Snapchat, Instagram, etc.) are cheap compared to having everyone leave Facebook for another service.",1384780142

After all, sometimes technology changes everything so much politics can do little more than try to catch up.<p>People like to say &quot;you can&#x27;t solve social problems with technology&quot;. It&#x27;s a statement that&#x27;s true enough of the time to be common wisdom but not enough to be a natural law. Sometimes technology <i>does</i> help with social problems.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that politics is unimportant. It is still central. But I think dismissing technological solutions out of hand is also shortsighted. I particularly think this of BitCoin, which feels like a monumental change. BitCoin could, ideally, liberate transactions between individuals and significantly reduce barriers for anything from microtransactions to donating to fringe political causes. It certainly won&#x27;t solve <i>all</i> our problems, it might even solve <i>none</i>, but I think it&#x27;ll definitely make for a better world.<p>I really liked Balaji Srinivasan&#x27;s speech on &quot;Voice and Exit&quot;. BitCoin was an example of &quot;exiting&quot; the existing financial system and providing an alternate means of conducting transactions. Viewing it as such, just using and supporting BitCoin is inevitably a political action, limiting the absolute power of the government. To me, this makes BitCoin one of the technologies to really watch for future social change.",1384780090

6754089,comment,6752484,6753358,1,0,Aqueous,,,"I&#x27;m giving you a hypothetical situation where Canada started up an exchange for Fords and offered the currency on the exchange for $0. What would happen? It would float toward the price that the market would bear, which would look like a thousands of percent increase.<p>The reason the Euro started off there is because, like an IPO, they thought that because an entire federation of countries was backing it, they could offer it initially for a price higher than $0, just like Facebook thought that because millions of people knew what Facebook was they could offer their shares for a higher price than $0. In all likelihood Canada would offer it for a price higher than $0, and the market would probably bear that price.<p>BitCoin couldn&#x27;t do that because it wasn&#x27;t introduced by a federation or a nation. Satoshi couldn&#x27;t just go to an exchange and offer BitCoins for $600 because nobody had heard of BitCoin and people were skeptical. So it had to make the journey from $0 to $600 on its own.<p>But now that it has earned the faith of the people who use it, what makes it different from a national currency being offered that price? Not much.<p>&quot; A currency is defined by liquidity and there just aren&#x27;t many things you can currently exchange for a bitcoin. &quot;<p>There are more and more things you can exchange a BitCoin for every single day. And if you&#x27;re a vendor, don&#x27;t you want to accept BitCoins? If someone wanted to give me a BitCoin in exchange for something worth say, $550, I would accept it because a BitCoin is worth about that much on the exchange and there&#x27;s a high chance that it will be worth more tomorrow. It might not make a whole lot of sense to spend BitCoins right now but for the very same reason it makes all the sense in the world to <i>accept</i> them. Vendors have every incentive to accept BitCoins at the moment, which means there will be more and more of them, which means BitCoin&#x27;s utility as a currency will only go up.
