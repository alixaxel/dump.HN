It&#x27;s called The Soundcloud Bible, and it just launched.<p>I actually run a record label and manage artists, and decided to do this once I had discovered that no one had published anything that really covered everything about the subject. Seeing as I have been working with electronic artists on a daily basis for the past two years, and have been using Soundcloud to market them, I had a solid base of experience and insight to work with.<p>The result is a 100+ page book that covers not only Soundcloud, but also how how to leverage it to score label deals and get blog support. A valuable guide for both musicians and industry professionals alike.<p>You can find a sample chapter of the book on the launch page.<p>And you can find the launch page here:\nhttp://www.budivoogt.com/soundcloudbible<p>I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts and will answer any questions the best I can.<p>- Budi",1384869518

6761142,comment,6752800,6753140,1,0,robert_tweed,,,"Let me give you my take as someone who has had to hire a lot of developers. Firstly, I&#x27;ll say it depends a lot on the person doing the hiring. Different people will look for different things.<p>For me though, any practical experience that you can show alongside your resume/CV is helpful for a few reasons:<p>1. If I see code of an excellent standard, I know I just need to use the interview to make sure you really did write it yourself, then if you&#x27;re a good personality fit, you&#x27;re hired. This makes my life a lot easier because it&#x27;s very hard to tell if someone will be a good coder without seeing them code. Not everyone is willing to do a practical trial, and not all employers have time to organise these either.<p>2. It lets me see if any assessment you give of yourself agrees with reality. Some people understate their abilities, but most overestimate themselves greatly. If I know where you sit on this spectrum I have a better idea of what to expect in terms of mentoring requirements, how to approach the interview, etc., to figure out if you are competent and whether any poor judgement is a problem, or just typical egocentrism.<p>3. It gives me things to talk about in the interview. Like, &quot;I saw you used X, why did you do that and not Y?&quot; Usually it&#x27;s when people can actually start talking about things like this that you can tell if they really understand what they are doing or not.<p>So, I wouldn&#x27;t be put off by the idea that you don&#x27;t have a lot of open source contributions out in the wild for employers to look at, simply because it may not matter to everyone. However if you do, it&#x27;s always of value and something you should highlight.<p>In any case, don&#x27;t underestimate the value of being able to show some work you have done. If your best work is closed source, try to get permission to show some of it to potential employers, while bearing in mind that they will be very busy and not hoping to wade through a ton of code figure out if you know what you&#x27;re doing or not. It&#x27;s an extra resource: if your skills look interesting, it allows them to see some evidence of what you&#x27;ve done, and poke around for interview talking points.<p>Often just knowing the type of projects you worked on and having proof of your contribution is enough to tell if you are the real deal or not. So if you can&#x27;t get access to sources, just indicate the projects, say what you did and try to get some evidence, like endorsements/references from colleagues. If you can&#x27;t provide evidence, expect the interviewer to grill you on this: it will soon become apparent if you were exaggerating your contributions.<p>The most important point is that if your CV/resume does not look good, they won&#x27;t want to look at your code anyway. Don&#x27;t shove it down their throats. Start off by selling yourself as concisely as possible, and use these kind of extra resources as evidence to back up what you say.<p>What I like most about these Github resumes is not so much the fact I can see individual contributions, but that I can very quickly see a project history and % breakdown by language, which is what I&#x27;d expect to see on a paper resume, except here I know it&#x27;s based on real data and not just something the candidate may have just made up. From data like this this I can tell within a few seconds if that person might be a good fit, and from there I may decide to go investigating further.<p>Just remember that if you apply for say, a Ruby job and 90% of your open source contributions are Python, you probably want to tell the employer somewhere e.g., &quot;I work with Ruby in my day job but most of my open source contributions are in Python&quot;. Only if the data is misleading though, like if as you said you have some open source contributions, but not enough to be representative.<p>TLDR: Employers are busy. Within a few seconds, they want to know &quot;does this person appear to have the skills I am looking for?&quot;. If that answer is yes then they may spend more time re-evaluating it, based on any evidence they can get. Source code is usually the best evidence a programmer&#x27;s ability. Less up-front evidence means any interview will be a lot more hit-and-miss: interviews alone are not a good way to assess coding ability.",1384869413
6761141,comment,6758649,6758649,1,0,yebyen,,,"I am surprised that nobody mentioned that yesterday, Coinbase crossed their global &quot;daily buy limit&quot;!  Users of Coinbase were greeted with a new interface to buy coins, prompting them to click and confirm their transactions would not be completed until Friday (the usual condition on a Monday) and that their USD-quoted price would be processed at the effective market rate at that time (if you&#x27;re used to doing business with Coinbase, they mention a time but really the deal is done at the time of their choosing) on Friday.<p>So, you are agreeing to spend a given amount of USD to acquire BTC, but the price is not fixed and you actually don&#x27;t know the number of BTC you&#x27;ll be getting until their calculation of the market rate occurs, five days from now.  I had the same experience as the person in Coinbase Blog, they white-listed me, now I have an expectation that they will deliver on their promises.<p>Before that, I don&#x27;t think I ever did (or had any reason to.)  Some company on the internet is agreeing to take my bank details and make a withdrawal from my bank account, but what happens next is anyone&#x27;s guess.<p>(A thought exercise: what is it exactly about letting 5 days pass before that makes it safer for Coinbase to part with a sum of bitcoins when a bank transfer is completed?  The owner of the account has had zero opportunity to contest the charge as fraudulent, and those bitcoins go &quot;at-risk&quot; on that day when the transaction is completed.  If there is a run on bitcoins, how does Coinbase guarantee they will be able to satisfy all of the orders they&#x27;ve accepted?)",1384869408

Since you&#x27;ve already triggered it with a large transaction (and it sounds like they have your money, too), maybe this option is no longer available to you.  When my transaction was cancelled, it was one that would indeed have been more profitable to me.<p>However, I contacted the support department, asked them to explain themselves politely, offered to place a reserve amount in my account, and they immediately offered to &quot;white list&quot; me and promised this would never happen to one of my transactions with them, ever again.<p>I passed the &quot;human, DBAA&quot; test (breaking bad reference), I guess.  If people like me go around telling about this policy, I would expect it to be less effective (or stop altogether) but as soon as this exchange was over, I was glad it had occurred.

I think people forget that this nation is constantly under some form of &quot;attack&quot; by groups (nation-state and otherwise) who hope to destabilize it or mitigate the power it can wield.<p>I&#x27;m an American and I&#x27;m fiercely proud of this country.  We screw up all the time, but we&#x27;ve been able to manage a peaceful transition of power and somehow manage to find our way in a difficult and challenging world.<p>I think it&#x27;s lost on MANY people who are not citizens or residents that the USA is HUGE, politically diverse, and nearly as varied in customs, socioeconomics, and population as Europe.  You can even stretch that to language in some parts of the USA.  Try and get around South Miami without at least a smattering of Spanish language ability.<p>Our legal system has it&#x27;s flaws.  You can definitely find examples of miscarriages of justice without too much trouble.  Our bureaucracy is sometimes incomprehensible.  Our tax systems are strange and often counterproductive.<p>What is often missing is that all of these things are the result of a vigorous political experiment in self-government.  Below the federal government, there are a whole slew of state, regional, city, town, village, and county governments that have wide latitude to set their own laws and practices.  In certain counties in the USA, it&#x27;s still illegal to buy alcohol.  In other counties, you can buy alcohol at a DRIVE THRU.<p>All of these variations are a result of people determining for themselves which laws they&#x27;ll live under.

This limits the amount a bank can loan at any time.<p>Slightly tangential to the main topic, but this is a common misunderstanding and incorrect. Bank lending is not constrained by the amount of reserves a bank has, because banks can and do lend each other reserves (or sell each other reserves in exchange for other assets).<p>So banks just make loans regardless of how many reserves they have. Afterwards, a separate department checks whether they satisfy the reserve requirements. If they do and they have too many reserves, they will try to lend those reserves to other banks. If they don&#x27;t, they will try to borrow reserves from other banks or from the central bank.<p>Note that banks still cannot make loans willy-nilly. It&#x27;s just that they&#x27;re constrained by <i>capital</i> requirements instead, as opposed to what people commonly believe.<p>Edit: If you are interested in the low-level workings of the system, I recommend reading the corresponding writeups of Modern Monetary Theory economists.

And then, someone shows you that it can be done in 35 lines of JavaScript.<p>As a hacker, it is a case study of (ab)using some JavaScript features on one hand (yes, <i>with</i> , I&#x27;m talking about you), and on the other hand, it is tractable proof about which part of (say) the 842 lines are useless, and why.<p>Many people have not experienced lots of functionality in very little code, and the fact that it is possible is both surprising, and often inspiring.<p>And JavaScript is familiar, so it gets an audience. If I posted the two (2) line K2 spreadsheet, that does a lot MORE (e.g. keyboard control) than the 30 line JS one, and needs a 200KB K interpreter, instead of a 20MB browser - then people will just ignore it with a SEP field.<p><pre><code>    S..t:&quot;.[`D;(;);{. y};S[]];S[.;`f]:9$D[]&quot;\n    S:D:.+(`$&#x27;_ci 97+!26;26 99#,&quot;&quot;);`show$`S\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to know more, head over to <a href=\"http://nsl.com/papers/spreadsheet.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://nsl.com/papers/spreadsheet.htm</a>",1384866580

Any of these characteristics trigger an automatic escalation in the interrogation process.  This individual, albeit sounding perfectly innocent, unfortunately triggered several hot buttons and the hapless agents were too unimaginative, uninformed, and inflexible to give him benefit of the doubt and let him pass.<p>99.9% of visitors do pass, because they are consistent with certain profiles--business visitor, tourist visitor, never-been-anywhere-bad visitor. Even for them, it&#x27;s a rather unpleasant and rude experience that leaves a bad taste.<p>There&#x27;s no question that our border control and immigration system needs an overhaul.  The stupidity and counter productivity of the agents who scrutinize every incoming person (except for a few thousand Mexicans every day, but that&#x27;s another topic :) inspires little confidence that they would actually recognize a terrorist, who would undoubtedly be carrying a false or sanitized passport to avoid just such questions.<p>I&#x27;m sorry that happened to the submitter, and I hope he&#x27;ll give us another try some day. If his story gets out to the right person or persons, it might even make a difference. I&#x27;m not convinced that Border control people will ever hear about it if posted here, but he can contact them directly:\n<a href=\"https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/175/~/complaint-of-rude-and-unprofessional-treatment\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://help.cbp.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/175/~/complaint...</a><p>By the way, this kind of profiling or over-profiling is not confined to U.S. Border Control agents. I have seen identical behavior by Canadian agents, too.  All I had to do was mention I was going to take a class, and the guy made us go into an interrogation room where he asked repeated, annoying questions to try to entrap me into admitting I was in Canada to work or some such thing.  I was born in Canada as it clearly states on my US passport, and he asked me where I was born, then looked at my companion with a sneer on his face as though to show his disbelief.
