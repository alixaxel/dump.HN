(Edited out some &#x27;heated&#x27; remarks)<p>Medicine is NOT, I repeat, NOT &#x27;hard&#x27; science. Most of the &#x27;normal&#x27; lab values we use when reporting things like elevated white blood cell count, anemia, etc. are based on population studies with the average considered normal and  setting extremes as &#x27;abnormal.&#x27; You will find that different hospitals even have different values of abnormal. Not to mention, for cutting edge therapies (Oncology, I&#x27;m looking at you) there is no &#x27;standard&#x27; of care and there is a high variability between physicians. My point is that, I could go on and on about how much the field of Medicine is subject to the vagaries of stuff like regional practice, academic pedigree (&quot;Oh, we at Hopkins always do it this way, but Mass Gen does it that way.&quot;), as well as bias like anecdotal evidence (the plural of anecdote is NOT data!) or just plain mis- or dated information. If you are out of med school/training for only a couple years, the amount of new therapies, lab tests, etc. can be staggering and if physicians aren&#x27;t learning about the new, then they quickly become dated.<p>So, what am I saying? The FDA is holding 23andMe to an unreasonable standard. If your doctor saw the same test results, they might tell you the exact same correlation (oh, you are predisposed to Alzheimer&#x27;s or Parkinson&#x27;s). Tests are incredibly complex... I mean we still don&#x27;t have a perfect pregnancy test! Again, there is sensitivity, specificity, with false positives and false negatives. If you are unfamiliar with how inaccurate medical tests can be, please read up on some of those items. This is the best we&#x27;ve got for now. If people can order pregnancy and HIV tests over the internet, there&#x27;s no reason they shouldn&#x27;t be able to find out they &#x27;might&#x27; have a predisposition to high blood pressure. I would argue 23andMe is not doing something so radical... as far as I&#x27;m concerned, pregnancy and HIV tests should NOT be over the counter if we are going to limit genetic screens because there is a LOT of work to be done in positives of either.<p>Unconvinced? Well consider this. Over the counter Tylenol products are responsible for about 500 deaths per year in the US. Do you believe that Tylenol should be prescription only just because a minority of consumers make mistakes? If not, then you must conclude that over the counter sales of 23andMe should be allowed unless the FDA can show it has ACTUALLY harmed people.<p><a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23974801/tylenol-warn-users-potentially-fatal-overdose-risk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_23974801/tylenol-warn...</a>",1385481559

I don&#x27;t have any strong evidence to back up my claims. That said, I&#x27;m skeptical of the numbers in the article you linked. I could be wrong, but in my experience players in high school were much more likely to report injuries than in college. Especially head injuries. Friends of mine in college, on multiple occasions, had headaches that lasted more than a week and refused to report them for fear of being benched or missing playing time. High school was the opposite, players would go to the trainers all the time for every little thing.<p>I can&#x27;t argue with numbers, but I am just not convinced the method of data collection is accurate.",1385481519

You aren&#x27;t getting extra mammograms because of 23andMe, they are the same thing.<p>Mammogram can screen you for early detection of a serious disease. 23andMe can do the same (they advertise - this is what the FDA has a problem with).<p>More screening for all diseases doesn&#x27;t mean better outcome, and can be harmful, depending on the test, the people screened, the disease, etc., etc. and can lead to more disease (needless treatment). Throwing more screening at the wall for every disease doesn&#x27;t do more good all the time. Especially when we learn that some diseases (prostate cancer) cause no symptoms most of the time. Treating these asymptomatic prostate cancers is very harmful, because they are harmless unless they progress. The treatment is risky and has serious side effects (impotence!)<p>Every time we have a screening test, we have to look at the science. What are we screening for? What is the good? What is the bad? Who is helped? Who is harmed? Do the positives outweigh the negatives?<p>Another outdated screening tool is the breast self exam - it was found (in scientific studies) it didn&#x27;t do any good and caused harm (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_self-examination\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_self-examination</a>) Lots of over treatment without a reduce in cancer rates. Also, just learning about it increases women&#x27;s worry and anxiety about breast cancer. This is a harmful screening tool. This was studied and abandoned.<p>----<p>BRCA test has nothing to do with this example.<p>Mammograms are currently very common in women a certain age >40 or >50. Most women get them every few years as part of their health maintenance to check for the presence of cancer, tumors or lumps. Right now there is research coming out that is questioning that practice, but the practice hasn&#x27;t caught up to the research and most doctors say &quot;get your mammogram&quot; without informing patients of the risks, they treat it like it is &quot;all good.&quot; That was the point of this research to ask &quot;are we doing the right thing here by screening all these healthy women with mammograms? Let&#x27;s study that.&quot;<p>I will personally opt out of the mammogram hype when I reach the mammogram age.

It seems one of the big lessons of the Industrial revolution was the right property laws.  The principles behind patents and copyright law make sense in this regard.  Its the specifics that have problems.<p>- The analogy to physical property is worth following more deeply - countries such as in S America, ie Chilie, are trying to undergo property law revolutions, and often local knowledge is clear - everyone &quot;knows&quot; that Juan lives in that building and has done since he was born, and maintains it for his family.  Therefore it is &quot;his&quot; house.  Our IP laws generally need to come to some agreement on a similar situation - where there is clear contentious dispute, local (ie expert) knowledge is needed.<p>- This is more or less what is happening here - someone is claiming Juan&#x27;s house was actually their house.  A jury was asked to decide with clear expert local knowledge.  So the process is <i>what</i> we want.  Its just in this example we choose a bunch of idiots for the jury.<p>- Software should be copyright.  This will cause difficulties in &quot;porting&quot; software, and in doing the same algorithm in php and then perl.<p>summary: IP rights is more likely to be a good thing than a bad thing, just like property rights.  However bad implementations of property law have seemingly held back countries like Brazil / Chile, and we do not really know what IP law should look like to be most suited.  I prefer allowing local knowledge to be primary in cases of dispute.<p>(<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/niall_ferguson_the_6_killer_apps_of_prosperity.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ted.com/talks/niall_ferguson_the_6_killer_apps_of...</a>)",1385478322
