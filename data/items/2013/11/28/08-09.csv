6813685,comment,6813120,6813657,2,0,snitko,,,"The thing to look at is incentives. What behavior the system incentivizes? People are elected for some n years and it is very difficult to fire them even if they don&#x27;t keep their promises and are doing a crappy job. More importantly, they take away taxes by force from the population, then redistribute those money and pretend <i>they</i> are doing something useful. &quot;We built those roads, we gave you education&quot;. Yes, except you didn&#x27;t. When you take someone else&#x27;s money by force, for whatever reason, even if you intend to give it to the poor, it is theft. But when a government does it, it suddenly becomes taxes. It can be argued that in a democracy people generally agree that taxes should be payed, but when you actually ask people whether they want to fund wars and NSA spying, turns out they really don&#x27;t want that. It is sold as a package and people are tricked and forced (whichever is needed) into financing horrible things with their own money.<p>Finally, you see, if a politician does a bad job, he still gets paid and keeps his job at least until the next election. If a private company messes up, people leave in droves and it goes bankrupt.<p>There might be some good people in the government, who truly believe they are doing some good. That doesn&#x27;t make the system good and they have zero chances to make it a good system.",1385629017

6813668,comment,6810543,6810543,1,0,jaekwon,,,"Just as there are lobbyists in Washing DC, and think-tanks that survey popular opinion to sway the people in a certain direction (e.g. why do you think the rich are getting richer; see Koch brothers), there are those who rely and profit from tax revenue who do not wish to see the Bitcoin experiment succeed. Just as Bitcoiners lobby for bitcoin, others will lobby against it.<p>I&#x27;m not Rothbard and I can&#x27;t prove to you that we will be better off with an unregulated decentralized currency. But I do want to see the experiment through, for the alternative is worst from a point of view of my morality -- certain members in government shutting down the Bitcoin experiment by decree, because it is inconvenient for them.<p>They will cite history and circumstances to justify their centralized control of a currency and the need for income taxes, but I also know alternative lines of reasoning that negate them. What I do know for sure is that control over currency gives near-absolute power to those who handle the levers, and I would imagine that such power is not something you simply abdicate.<p>There are aspects of the economy that does require a policing authority, in such areas as environmental sustainability to prevent a tragedy of the commons. A growing income disparity between the wealthy <1% and the impoverished majority is also another tragedy of the commons, but perhaps the current way of dealing with these issues aren&#x27;t actually helping. I suspect that a better way to deal with these issues is more competition amongst alternative economic forces, and for that we need a diaspora of currencies; currency and economy is what helps people converge upon a stable state solution in a distributed fashion. It&#x27;s a heck of a tool, and we&#x27;d be damned if we don&#x27;t explore its uses.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the future holds for us in terms of governance structures. Bitcoin shows us that not everything need be &quot;privatized&quot; as the old libertarians had predicted. I think we&#x27;re just now entering the beginning of the end for government as we know it. It&#x27;s going to be exciting, wrought with pain, and probably unfathomably rewarding.<p>All that I ask is that any time you encounter an argument that assumes that taxes must be paid to fund a centralized government that controls the issuance of currency (for the good of the people), think twice before nodding your head. Our technology is new and we don&#x27;t yet know what is possible.",1385628615

If some external middleware can provide more value in some columns than it offsets in other columns, it is usually a good bet.

To put it simply, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s essentially a problem of incentive and reciprocation. All living things are hard-wired with the incentive to keep being as a unit and as a species, in a system made for and by them. An Artificial Intelligence on the other hand, in my view, would be &quot;born&quot; with no incentive to be, assuming it wouldn&#x27;t have the tools to reproduce and evolve (at least in a Darwinian way), among other things. I think it would require a concept of eventuality (i.e. death) and the means to circumvent it beyond its own existence to find enough value in being. As for reciprocation, I imagine it would require a system of its peers (a.k.a. a form of society, even rudimentary) to assess its place and value as a being, without which, again, it most likely wouldn&#x27;t have any incentive to be.<p>I&#x27;m not saying these things won&#x27;t eventually be part of what AIs will be (if they ever are), I just believe that the first AIs will most likely lack some, if not all, of these features. This is, of course, if we assume that the first AIs will be &quot;born&quot; as fully developed, much like a baby born without the millions of years of biological and social evolution behind it.

You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes [grins].

Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind.</i><p>So what Neo later sees are endless fields of human beings being grown for the very purpose of obtaining energy from them. Still don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s going on here?<p>And then later in the training program he tells Neo this:<p><i>Morpheus:  The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you&#x27;re inside, you look around, what do you see? Business men, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system, and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged.

I know Intel does this for both their Phi and regular CPUs.<p>For me, the most important thing in both CUDA and OpenCL is the programming model. It allows us to describe data parallel problems and related data (in)dependence explicitly. Compilers should be (and already are) able to generate efficient code from this. It is not as nice as it could be, we have to write kernels by hand etc. But there are libraries that make our lives easier (we discussed them earlier). And there is also C++ AMP which tries to integrate better. Yet still, while we have all these options and we can solve most of our problems with more or less effort and elegance, I believe there must be something better out there: the right way to describe data parallel and task parallel problems as well as concurrency etc. Maybe the FP guys are on to something, I don&#x27;t know.

While &#x27;>&#x27; is an operator in scala and other languages, it&#x27;s also an operator in basic mathematics. And in basic math, we&#x27;re taught &quot;if x is greater than zero&quot; using the notation of &quot;if x > 0&quot; (parentheses notwithstanding.)<p>It&#x27;s only consistent in terms of how clojure presents it, but it&#x27;s inconsistent with treatment elsewhere. Consistency does go to simplicity, but if it takes some &quot;getting used to&quot;, it can&#x27;t be all that simple.",1385626328

6813555,comment,6812499,6813211,1,0,d0m,,,"I think it&#x27;s also in the mentality as in it&#x27;s perfectly fine in lisp to use simple lists as data structure, whereas we mostly use wrapper objects around primitive or collections in Java.<p>For instance, you&#x27;ll often see a &quot;Person&quot; class definition with getters, setters around the .adds collection function. The idea is to encapsulate the collections as much as possible so that if it changes down the road, nothing else is affected but that simple method. In lisp, however, you&#x27;d probably just (let (people &#x27;(&quot;tom&quot; &quot;john&quot;))) and be done with it. I&#x27;m obviously exaggerating, but hopefully you get my point. It&#x27;s similar in Python where I use dicts all the time, but feel bad using it in Java or C++ without abstracting or encapsulating it.<p>It&#x27;s not so much a syntax issue (even though clojure syntax is less verbose than Java) but mostly the mentality behind the idioms IMHO.",1385626124

6813553,comment,6812823,6812823,2,0,mcallan83,,,"Great site! I like the minimalist look! Here are a few thoughts:<p>Since you are going responsive, you may want to look into doing a mobile first design. It is a lot easier to get your content looking good on a small screen and then slowly work your way up to a full screen experience. Going from full screen down to mobile is a lot harder. You will end up with more code, and find yourself fighting your existing styles to get things working on the small screen. Since you are using bootstrap, I&#x27;d recommend you use the built in grid system to help with this. (I fought grid systems for years... now, I wouldn&#x27;t build a site without them.)<p>Another area I would concentrate on is typography. Choosing matching fonts can be tricky. A good rule of thumb is to pick two fonts that really contrast each other. In your case, the fonts basically look the same. Try picking a serif font for headings and sans-serif for body copy or the other way around. Google &quot;font pairings&quot; for more examples. I&#x27;d also bump up the body font size a bit and increase the line height. Aim for no more than 10 words per line for the best readability. (HN doesn&#x27;t follow this and it is a pain reading long comments!) Again, Bootstrap has great defaults for type. I&#x27;d recommend sticking with them at first and then tweaking things as you finalize your layout.<p>Finally, I&#x27;d simplify your effects a bit. Every animation should serve a purpose and enhance the user experience. It is fun to dig in and make things move, but if not done properly, they become a huge turnoff. The hard part is making them feel natural and finely polished. Many times very subtle animations do so much more that large ones. Think &quot;pat on the back&quot; vs. &quot;punch to the face&quot;. (Not saying your site is a punch to the face.... just repeating some advice a designer once gave me.) As your skills improve, you can add more complex animations and effects that add value to your site.<p>Overall you did great for your first site. Digging in and trying new things is the best way to learn.  If you ever need assistance with anything, feel free to reach out.",1385626088

It&#x27;s not just a question of switching from imperative language X to clojure and seeing a huge productivity boost. You must also understand why clojure is designed the way it is and how to use it effectively. For awhile, you&#x27;ll likely be less productive as you learn how to approach problems functionally and wrap your head around the capabilities of lisp, but you&#x27;ll also be building stronger, more reliable systems, and at the end of the learning process, you will indeed be significantly more productive.<p>Managing a transition like this is far from trivial for a company facing a variety of immediate demands and constraints, even if it promises to pay dividends in the long run.",1385626034
