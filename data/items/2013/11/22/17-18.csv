Our goal with the Summer Academy is to initially provide a supplement to traditional education, and eventually provide a replacement for it. As a supplement it may seem like a programming camp for rich kids (we&#x27;re doing our best to make it more accessible through scholarships). But as a replacement we hope to offer the same or better value (through practical education, professional network, and eventually even brand name) as traditional education at a fraction of the cost.",1385143193

When I was checking out various Lisps some time ago, I saw in (IIRC) Franz Lisp that they had something like Visual Studio&#x27;s Edit and Continue (maybe before VS did). Not a Lisper myself, though I&#x27;ve dabbled in it now and then and like it, so maybe that has been a feature of Lisps from much before - don&#x27;t know.",1385143187
6782444,comment,6780306,6781837,2,0,rz2k,,,"I think it pretty amazing reading physics forums where it seems clear that a lot of the people think mathematics is almost some kind of joke until substantiated by physicists. And then there was the usually insightful Lawrence Krauss&#x27;s blanket dismissal of philosophy — while philosophical musings that contradict known data are problematic, much of philosophy lies outside the domain of physics.<p>Anyway, in regard to the idea of science &quot;stack&quot;, I kind of enjoyed Alan Lightman&#x27;s <i>Reunion</i> where he poses a nineteenth century astronomer&#x27;s obsession with and histrionics in response to rejection by a cute young woman in his observatory as a kind of &quot;proof&quot; that biology studied more powerful forces. The event simultaneously lead to the astronomer abandoning his career and inspired hers in biology.[1] Though obviously meant as joke, the author himself transitioned from a successful career as a physicist to writing and teaching literature.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=4nQhY2fbX2IC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://books.google.com/books?id=4nQhY2fbX2IC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA1...</a>",1385143185

Because for any given operation they want to be able to specify the overall options, language options, warning options, debugging options, optimization options, preprocessor options, assembler options, linker options, directory options, machine-dependent options, platform options, code gen options, etc. As if all of those options would relate to every single GCC operation!<p>They seem to have a mandate that input from ARGV is the only way to determine how to run their program. And it works for them; using autoconf and Makefiles you can configure the options each command will use in a very fine-grained way. But the end result is that for 99% of these cases, you have to use autoconf and Makefiles to make sense of anything! So what the hell is the point of stuffing them all in ARGV if a human isn&#x27;t even going to use them anyway? They could have just as easily set environment variables and been done with it (lord knows why; probably some 30-year-old backwards compatibility issue)<p>I prefer the &#x27;cvs&#x27; model of command-line processing. The creators knew they wanted one command which would let them do everything, but they also knew that there would be separate operations with their own options. So you specify a command, and then you specify your options. In this way, you know -a for &#x27;ls&#x27; is probably going to be different than -a for &#x27;diff&#x27; - but you can also look up these options incredibly easy using &#x27;cvs --help command&#x27;. Now instead of having a soup of options to browse through, you know exactly what options relate to the specific operation you want to do.<p>The program&#x27;s execution and options become easier to understand using this option hierarchy. It also distributes well because your commands have unique names. And no more looking up the 1000-page manual to find the one option you wanted.",1385142063

6782308,comment,6780141,6780407,1,0,arxanas,,,"There are two classes of play: sanctioned and unsanctioned (or tournament and casual). Among sanctioned play, there are several &quot;formats&quot;, which define which cards can and can&#x27;t be used in a deck. Black Lotus is only playable in the &quot;Vintage&quot; format, which is the least restricted and therefore most powerful format. Not many people play it compared to other formats, probably primarily because the cards in it are so expensive, and because not many people play the format.<p>You could attempt to forge a copy for play in a tournament. However, such copies are illegal in tournaments and doing this would get you banned from sanctioned tournaments [1]; pretty much the only place where people play Vintage is those tournaments. Furthermore, it&#x27;s probably more likely that your cards might be examined on suspicion since there are less people and the stakes tend to be high [2]. It&#x27;s also somewhat difficult to replicate well a Magic card, so you&#x27;d probably not do well at it.<p>In casual play, people just print out a copy of the card and put it in front of another card in a card sleeve. Oftentimes it&#x27;s less high-tech: one might scribble its name on a piece of paper or just write over a worthless card. This practice is called &quot;proxying&quot; cards, and such a replacement is called &quot;proxy&quot;. You could very well just proxy it and play with your friends like that. People don&#x27;t use Black Lotus in casual play because it&#x27;s fairly overpowered and wouldn&#x27;t make for fun games. (Though if the rest of the deck is of equal card quality, and one is playing with friends with comparable deck strength, it is still done: you would just be playing unsanctioned Vintage.)<p>[1]: Tournaments are sanctioned by some Wizards of the Coast organization called the DCI. They maintain a banlist of players. Local game stores register their tournaments through WotC, so basically you&#x27;d be banned from all places where you could play Vintage.<p>[2]: I&#x27;ve never been to a Vintage tournament so I don&#x27;t know if they check this, or if so, how, but I&#x27;m pretty sure they&#x27;d ban you if they found a forgery.",1385142030

That little bit of inflation makes it more attractive to invest money in things that increase one&#x27;s ability to generate money in the future instead of just stuffing it under a mattress.  That makes the economy as a whole more vigorous, which means everyone tends to get more wealthy in the long run.<p>As for deflation in Bitcoin: Since the total number of BTC that can ever exist is asymptotically bounded, but potential economic productivity of a population of humans isn&#x27;t (as far as we know), there&#x27;s really only a few scenarios where BTC deflation might level off, and arguably all of them fall under the category of &quot;economic crisis&quot;.",1385141478

Deflation in a currency is not a deal breaker. Bitcoin is volatile right now because it is so young. People are predicting it will reach a huge market capitalization, which would necessarily entail a huge USD price per bitcoin because there are so incredibly few bitcoins in comparison to USD. Anytime something is increasing in value there will be considerable gambling and speculation to come along with it as random people jump on and off the train repeatedly.<p>What bitcoin really needs is a unique and innovative service which could not exist without it. This would encourage people to hold a small balance in bitcoin which they would be willing to spend in order to enable participation in this service not otherwise possible. As the currency stabilizes and more and more use cases emerge, people will slowly but steadily become more comfortable holding larger balances in bitcoin.",1385141202

I&#x27;m quite befuddled by the social justice rhetoric that is so popular today. It&#x27;s not that there aren&#x27;t legitimate equality issues in need of solving, but a lot of people do not focus on these anymore. Rather, they&#x27;re willing to point out supposed misogyny everywhere they go. Even when there isn&#x27;t any.<p>The concept of &quot;privilege&quot;, while doubtlessly real, is barely ever noted by the ones it actually affects. Instead it&#x27;s typically used as a tool of demagoguery by the same privileged people to instill guilt into others, or just to demonstrate their perceived moral superiority.<p>But for the love of me, I cannot comprehend why one would have such a vendetta against something as benevolent as FOSS. Something that is meant to strengthen community, to encourage freedom of information and empowerment. To everyone. Not just white males.<p>Ah, but since most people working on FOSS are &quot;privileged white males&quot;, then we must demonize the entire effort. Most programmers are &quot;privileged white males&quot;, so this is only a natural consequence. I don&#x27;t see what the problem is.<p>All that is stopping you from contributing is your programming skills. Software does not discriminate on basis of race, class or anything like that. All that matters is: &quot;Can you program?&quot; Then you have other positions like raising awareness and activism, which do not necessarily require programming aptitude.<p>But most people will counter that the culture of programming is fundamentally male-centric and misogynistic. Male-centric it is, given that most programmers are male. The same way nursing is female-centric. Misogynistic? No. But, whenever something even mildly offensive is said or done by a programmer, it is swallowed, regurgitated, swallowed again ad nauseum by news and media. Sometimes for no good reason, as in the Adria Richards case.<p>It&#x27;s fallacious to assume that just because arbitrary quota X is not met, we need to alleviate the &quot;issue&quot; immediately. Yet this is how most people see it: an &quot;issue&quot; that can be fixed through affirmative action and ideological changes. What ideology? There is no single programmer ideology.<p>You know what I think is misogynistic? Assuming that women are weak, fragile and whenever someone makes joke in poor taste (such as Titstare), that we should immediately go up in arms and do something about all the poor oppressed women that were offended by this.<p>This is what happens when people use their primal emotions to guide their thinking. There is nothing wrong with being emotional, but this is ridiculous.<p>I absolutely think that most women are perfectly capable of handing whatever sexism they may encounter on their way in a rational manner. But it&#x27;s not an institutional problem in software, it&#x27;s something that certain individuals may display, sometimes not even deliberately.<p>Asinine social justice rhetoric only serves to fuel unwarranted anger against microaggressions. It weakens us all. It makes people actively look for oppression and offensive material in places where there aren&#x27;t any.<p>Aye. Back in the day, if someone tried to flirt with a woman on the subway, she would brush it off and move on with her life. Today, she would go back to her home, open up her $1,200 MacBook Pro and write a blog article about how all of womankind is being systematically oppressed by privileged white men daily.<p>Please.",1385140536

First with an estimate of the size required for the whole thing, from two locations, then with steadily increasing values starting from 1, from the mult function.  With the first allocation we can theoretically perform a complicated operation (a good thing when ASLR is involved) to any location in ruby&#x27;s bss section after freelist, but every increase requires doubling the size of the input string, and 16 already requires a 300k string, so going more than a few notches forward is impractical.  With the second, I think k=16 is guaranteed to get a hit, because the next variable after freelist in the code is:<p><pre><code>    static Bigint *p5s;\n</code></pre>\nOn my system, and probably on all, this duly shows up immediately afterwards in the binary, and p5s is set before the allocation, so it&#x27;s not null.  The code ends up &quot;allocating&quot; p5s and copying 64k of arbitrary data into p5s->x, which comes from the &#x27;private_mem&#x27; static array, also in the bss section.  Although this is certainly dangerous, on the 3 systems I tried (OS X, 64-bit Linux, 32-bit Linux), there was much less than 64k of memory in the segment after the array and something read-only immediately followed, so it was guaranteed to crash before anything interesting could happen.  It could be possible to exploit anyway if another C thread were accessing the data (not sure if mri ever does this), but the timing would be extremely difficult.<p>So I suspect that on most systems, this is purely a DOS, even though it involves an overwrite of arbitrary data.  However, I could definitely be missing something, as the code is fairly complicated.",1385140387

I think it was a neat idea, and it was the lens through which I interpreted this comment.<p>The trivium consists of grammar, dialectic, and rhetoric [1]. Grammar signifies knowing the language/jargon. E.g. knowing the parts of a car. Dialectic signifies logic and critical thinking. E.g. realizing that adding more oil won&#x27;t fix the alternator. Rhetoric signifies application and expression. E.g. designing a safe, high-performance, cost-effective, and aesthetically-appealing vehicle.<p>Regarding your anecdote about not understanding abstraction of shapes. It sounds to me like your friend is comfortable with grammar, but not dialectic.<p>According to this redditor, a major flaw in the education system is that it teaches &quot;subjects&quot; (grammar) while critical thinking (dialectic) is shafted (mostly limited to math class) [2]. But I repeatedly read stories about people who can program without anything more than a basic understanding.

The value of 683lm/W is the peak of human eye sensitivity curve and occurs at 555nm. The only light source that can achieve 100% &quot;efficiency&quot; by that measure is a 100%-efficient radiator that emits monochromatic 555nm (bright green) light, the best a perfect white light source can do is about 37%. (see [1])<p>* That &quot;perfect white light source&quot; would be a 100%-efficient radiator emulating the Sun spectrum bandlimited to visible light (zero infrared, uv and no other losses).<p>* It&#x27;s possible to make a light source that appears white to human eye and is more efficient than that by emitting mostly at wavelengths the human eye is more sensitive to, and emitting less at wavelengths it&#x27;s less sensitive to. That&#x27;s part of the reason why manufacturers often offer CFLs with high efficiency but poor color rendering and lower efficiency but higher color rendering. (And don&#x27;t get me started on the color rendering index.)<p>* That definition of &quot;efficiency&quot; is obviously not what most people think it is when they hear that word (useful work / total work spent), some prefer to call it &quot;luminous coefficient&quot;. But it&#x27;s not all lies, it was defined that way because it&#x27;s easy to compute and understand and because this is the value of interest if e.g. you&#x27;re making a LCD backlight or if you&#x27;re designing an interior lighting setup.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficacy\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_efficacy</a>",1385140144

For example, there are many aspects of physics that a biologist takes for granted or doesn&#x27;t even reason about when considering biological systems. They may need to reason about, say, chemistry from first principles. But I would be surprised for many biologists to have to apply much reasoning from quantum mechanics.<p>Again, this is not a value judgement. A similar thing exists with computers. People who write web applications depend on user-application infrastructure, who depend on systems applications, which depend on operating systems, which depends on computer architecture, which depends on materials engineering and so on. As a systems programmer, I regularly reason about operating systems and computer architecture. But I never reason about the properties of the materials that make the hardware. The computer architects, though, may have to reason about the materials, as it can provide constraints to their designs.",1385139734
