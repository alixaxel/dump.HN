I went on to hire and assist eight others in acquiring it and then employed them to write, along with myself, a successful machine tool controller of serious sophistication employing a three way tightly coupled Mot 68010 MP system (using bus fault recovery to resolve address collisions) of my design.

6822592,comment,6820967,6822325,1,0,visarga,,,"> When a company espouses a newfound interest in design, but lets a major design issue on the largest platform for their products just sit there (visibly) unaddressed, you get a sense they don&#x27;t have the right people in the right places to get stuff done yet.<p>Same for Google Maps. I live in Romania and we have had high-rez satellite and maps of our country, including street view, but for 7+ years we haven&#x27;t had GPS locations of individual house numbers.<p>Android being the most popular phone and Google Maps the most popular GPS/maps app in Romania, not to be able to locate a house on a long street makes it almost useless. GMaps simply points to the middle point of the street - if it is miles long, then you might be a long way from your actual destination.<p>Why can&#x27;t a multi-billion dollar company get their act together and finish their work? Even small GPS companies sell products that can look up houses on the street, but not Google. Could it be that it is too expensive even for them, or that Romania is worthless for them to spend time to finish the job?<p>I raised the issue on reddit, send feedback directly to them and at one time I even met a Google Maps employee and  described our frustration with the Romanian Maps to him  directly, but nothing gets done. It&#x27;s like we fell off the Google Map™  into &quot;forgotten land&quot;. And it&#x27;s not a minor issue, it&#x27;s like the most central thing a GPS does.",1385797802

Attempting to put legal dogs onto this type of issue does not at all cover the scope of how society&#x27;s perception pans out.<p>The fact that a legal system might punish someone does not in any way demotivate the behavior but merely makes it more intractable when it does happen. That someone is punished doesn&#x27;t change the motivations behind the victim&#x27;s name change, and other efforts.<p>The question still stands, for companies or institutions of victims like this: Do we want to affiliate ourselves with someone who has a love life that cannot be respected[0], that is out of line with our organization&#x27;s ethos?<p>Punishment does not at all address this cultural problem: <i>What</i> is porn ?<p>[0]: &quot;But the presence of Hip as a working philosophy in the sub-worlds of American life is probably due to jazz, and its knife-like entrance into culture, its subtle but so penetrating influence on an avant-garde generation—that post-war generation of adventurers who (some consciously, some by osmosis) had absorbed the lessons of disillusionment and disgust of the Twenties, the Depression, and the War.

I&#x27;m convinced that the failure of existing online courses has been primarily a problem of motivation, rather than an inherent pedagogical problem in online coursework. It&#x27;s very hard to motivate yourself to consistently work on coursework if there are no deadlines and dropping the course just means you keep going with it sometime later. Still, I can&#x27;t really explain why the SJSU courses failed as well; it sounds like students had actual deadlines, and were &quot;required&quot; to complete the courses to the same degree they&#x27;re required to complete their regular courses. It&#x27;s possible that the online tools to ask for help didn&#x27;t work as well as in-person interaction, or that sitting in front of a computer doing things at random times is less motivating than actually attending lectures in person at regular times. There&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;m certain of, however: it&#x27;s a huge waste to have universities pay professors (who are selected for their research ability, not teaching skills) to repeatedly lecture the same material to small groups of people. A hybrid model might work best. Lectures could still be online (but possibly at fixed times to prevent procrastination), but they would be supplemented by in-person recitations, where students would meet in small groups with instructors and have the opportunity to ask questions or review particular topics, with the instructor as well as with peers. This model is still far more expensive and less accessible than online courses hoped to be, but it might actually work.",1385795887

This would be equivalent to the Sun heating the earth+atmosphere on the order of a few percent more than it already does (see below).<p>This seems like a pretty intractable problem with these sorts of plans to beam energy to earth.<p>---\nshowing my work...<p>Microwaves attenuate in the atmosphere at about 15 dB/km or 3%/km (see <a href=\"http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/4963/RLE-TR-087-14236979.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/4963/RLE-TR-08...</a>). If the signal is losing power, its going somewhere: notably as energy (some converted to heat) into the atmosphere.<p>If you&#x27;re sending 13 PetaWatts (as indicated in the original link) through 10+ km of atmosphere, that&#x27;s 3.400 PetaWatts, or 26% of the power, &quot;lost&quot; on the way to earth. All the power that&#x27;s &quot;lost&quot; is being absorbed by the atmosphere and contributing to atmospheric heating.<p>The earth gets 174 Petawatts of incoming radiation from the Sun (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_energy</a>), but 30% of that actually gets reflected back, so the Sun heats with 122 PW of incoming solar radiation and this plan would add 3.4 PW, 3% more.<p>Note that I didn&#x27;t take into account the thinning of the atmosphere or the fact that not all the energy goes into heat (some of it could be absorbed in other ways). However, you still end up with some pretty significant additional heating and having microwaves absorbed by doing things like breaking chemical bonds in the atmosphere probably isn&#x27;t a great thing either.",1385795210
