Plus, Dale Carnegie seems to have left a cultural mark on Americans comparable to that Confucius left on Chinese ))<p>The funny thing - it&#x27;s in the same way English (and by extension American) people got rid of 2nd person singular pronoun (&quot;thou&quot;), and I find some of underlying debate pretty much the same. &quot;It&#x27;s more convenient and you run no risk of alienating someone with only the polite form left&quot; on one side and &quot;yes, but with potentially impolite form gone you have no means to actually express politeness&quot; on the other.<p>The question is - does universality of polite behavior (smiling, using plural) actually devalue it over time?<p>The answer, at least for me, is something similar to dieting + cheat day dynamic - feel free to form a habit out of the healthier thing (method act yourself by smiling) but maintain your baseline by exploring the opposite (admit you&#x27;re feeling bad today, look miserable when you feel miserable), if it&#x27;s around 10-to-1 healthy-to-opposite ratio.<p>American way gets the first part down, and directionally I think we Russians should learn from that (in other words, we sure should smile for no reason MORE), but the other extreme has its dangers as well.\nStoic philosophy of life, anyone?",1384937798

I&#x27;ve had the same issues in the past, but to be honest I think it&#x27;s just a matter of getting to know the different sites and achieving an intuitive feel for where questions should go. It may not be perfect, and you may get blow-back if you post in the wrong site, but then learn from that and move on. As programmers, we should be used to failing when we try something, but we don&#x27;t give up and abandon what we&#x27;re doing: we try again until we succeed. And if that comes off a bit stoic (for programmers, and non-programmers alike) then I think that the person may need to readjust their ideas of what SO/SE is. It&#x27;s a collection of random strangers who have been interacting for a period of time and built up certain social conventions which they start to expect people to conform to. Just as in real life you don&#x27;t go up to a group of people and expect them to be perfectly willing to accept you no matter how you behave (good or bad). Yes, the separation is bad. Yes in the SO/SE case, it could <i>maybe</i> be improved, but generally there is always going to be overlap. With the advent of area51 it seems people really want to specialize the SE sites, which makes the problem worse: but that is what the community seems to want. I think that in order to fully solve the problem, there should only be one SE site, and everything could be separated appropriately by tags",1384937672

6767008,comment,6765734,6766807,5,0,adamlett,,,"> Could you explain the relevant complexity, particularly as it applies to this example?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s simple if all a parolee has to do is to make sure he spends every single night in the halfway home. That might not make a lot of sense, but if that was the _only_ rule he had to follow, it might be simple.<p>My guess is there are many rules to follow, and a lot of them don&#x27;t make sense to the individual parolee. A rule like having to spend every single night at the halfway home is there for a reason, but the reason (probably) is not to prevent parolees from seeing their girlfriends. So it&#x27;s easy for someone to think that they aren&#x27;t doing anything wrong when spending the night at their girlfriend&#x27;s, even if they might be aware that they are -- technically -- breaking a rule. They might also (naïvely) expect to be met with some kind of reasonably response to said rule violation.<p>People have difficulty with rules that don&#x27;t make sense to them. It&#x27;s very easy to think: &quot;This can&#x27;t possibly apply to me in this situation&quot;.<p>Finally, one more thought: I know this is borderline Godwin, but this reminds me of rape and blaming the victim.

What you get with universe and multiverse packages is essentially a snapshot of Debian development at the time U+1 was forked from Debian testing or unstable. There are packages which are also in the stable branch of Debian or may later <i>become</i> packages in that branch, but often more changes are made before it goes into the next Debian stable release.<p>Secondly, a package in Debian stable mustn&#x27;t have any applicable release critical bugs <i>at the time the release is made</i>. If after release a package (in Debian, Ubuntu or any other derivative) is discovered to allow for remote code execution in its default configuration for instance, there&#x27;s no hiding behind what it says on the tin. The bug doesn&#x27;t care how it&#x27;s labeled and you should act on it.<p>Thirdly, packages in universe and multiverse only get community support, as opposed to support from Canonical for the duration of the support cycle. The entire point of having a repository system (like apt or yum) is that you can mix and match them to your liking and choose which packages may come from which source. So if you can get better support elsewhere, there should be no stopping you from subscribing to that support channel.<p>Personal package archives I&#x27;d generally not recommend because they may not be vetted as well as the more official repositories and the support commitment (when it exists) might not be at the same level.

The irony in your comment is strong. Blackwater and its derivations became powerful specifically because of [the many] having their labor (e.g. taxation) and choice (e.g. systemic control) forcefully deferred to [the few] of <i>the state (in its singular, arbitrary version of existence)</i>. The rest of the US military is already nearly <i>wholly</i> dependent on so-called private interests. Realistically, there is no difference between private and public entities on this same platform. Either an entity is accountable to such oligarchical &#x27;control&#x27; or it is not.<p>> <i>Free market</i><p>Like most terms that become distorted and perverted through political propaganda, a &quot;free market&quot; can have wildly different meanings. You may find that you support a freer market.<p>A free market as some people define it is one in which groups of trade (businesses) are <i>less powerful</i> because &quot;corporations&quot; would not exist in law. People would exist. Business would exist. Legal buffers from responsibility of actions would not exist. Those buffers currently afford the largest corporations of today the luxury of exploiting people and land through the use of government -- not only protecting directors from their violent actions but also increasing the platform where police/military force serves their corporate law. In a free market where abstract entities are not state-protected, all actions fall under the same domain of scrutiny. Frameworks of law as far as business is concerned would be relegated to protecting people <i>from</i> direct contractual fraud or abuse, only to the extent financial or physical damage is <i>actually</i> taking place. Therefore, egregious economic fines and prison sentences for non-violent actions that disobey corporate law would be a token of more brutal eras. Systems of this sort are often paired with models that give people, the public, more direct control over the flow of their own labor/money, thereby making it harder for abusive or surreptitious entities (e.g. every war/surveillance company) to gain vast power through the current top-heavy, centralized money pools of a government&#x27;s taxation. A transition to more human freedom such as this isn&#x27;t possible overnight; but it is worth aspiring to in the evolution of governmental systems. That&#x27;s humanist.<p>Other people define a &quot;free market&quot; as a system in which corporations are still greatly protected yet even less susceptible to recourse by people.

States near Mexico have similar homicide rates to Mexico (much lower than Mexico, but higher than some other states).

In short - they are most likely new to that kind of money (vast majority of Russians don&#x27;t have enough to go on vacation abroad), they are VERY insecure about it (as in - need to prove, mostly to themselves, that it&#x27;s not temporary), they&#x27;re under a lot of pressure (because they&#x27;re not actually sure why it&#x27;s THEM getting decent money and not everyone around and because there&#x27;s a lot of competitors) and they don&#x27;t know how to handle themselves (once again - they&#x27;re pretty new to this).<p>Let&#x27;s just hope that, like pirates, they will soon become extinct.
