6818312,comment,6815480,6817766,2,0,clhodapp,,,"Some things to note:<p>I think you&#x27;re mixing casts and conversions. At least in the parlance that I&#x27;m used to, you can only cast a number to a String or a String to a number in a memory-unsafe language (and it&#x27;s rarely what you want and a bit dangerous). When you do this, the system will take your word that the data is actually a String and interpret those literal bits in memory as one. In a memory-safe language, this cast would, of course, likely raise an exception. In Scala, you can cast any object to any type with that object&#x27;s asInstanceOf method.<p>In Scala (and many other languages), you can <i>convert</i> numbers to Strings and back. In fact, any object can be converted to a String via that object&#x27;s toString method (which every object has as a quirk inherited from Java). Strings can also be converted to numbers via toX methods (e.g. toInt, toFloat, etc.). Of course, these conversions will raise exceptions if the content of the String does not match the format of the numeric type you are converting to.<p>This all matters because it is how the + method on String works: it doesn&#x27;t (unsafely) <i>cast</i> its argument to a String. Rather, it (safely) <i>converts</i> it via its toString method. You may dislike the idea this method exists (I certainly do, and wish it could be deprecated now that Scala has String interpolation), but it is just a method that happens to be defined on the standard library&#x27;s String type and not a major defeat of the type system.",1385711408

6818304,comment,6815827,6817255,2,0,bostik,,,"> <i>I remember that Meego went back and forth between WebKit and Gecko</i><p>I know at least one very good reason, from personal pain.<p>Meego preceded Qt 5.0. QtWebKit was not part of official Qt releases until 5.1, and in 4.x the situation was even worse. Back then QtWebKit was always a second-class citizen. The browser engine was a separate &quot;Qt component&quot;. This meant that all releases were done individually, outside and out of pace with the Qt proper. Any release lagged behind the Qt releases, taking anywhere from weeks to months to catch up and work with the most recent Qt release. I got the idea that the webkit team was severely undermanned and overworked.<p>This meant that for any product that wanted to use QtWebKit, the product manager had to make an early decision to lock the version of used Qt just to ensure that QtWebKit was available. (Customers demanded a working browser engine with bells and whistles.) So from a purely practical point of view it made sense to decouple the browser engine and Qt release at architectural level.<p>No wonder Meego hovered between the two options. They had the choice of not using the latest Qt releases but having a more finely integrated browser engine - or they could go with the latest Qt, a decoupled browser engine and doing a horrible amount of additional integration work to keep Qt and Gecko in sync.<p>As one can imagine, neither of those options is particularly appealing.",1385711120

Their targeting also doesn&#x27;t do a very good job.<p>But let me tell you the real problem with YouTube ads. Recently in my country there has been a public outcry against a mining project, which is dangerous not only because of ecological reasons, but also because it needs special laws that trump our constitutional rights and the whole deal is filled with documented corruption. Movies started popping on Youtube describing the perils of open-pit gold mining with cyanide.<p>Well guess what, the company behind the project started displaying ads on every one of those clips, showing local poor villagers crying for &quot;jobs&quot;, with one of the big fat lies of the project being that it will create plenty of jobs. It won&#x27;t of course, but that&#x27;s besides the point.<p>The point is, say somebody believes in something and posts a video on YouTube. A company or an individual can always display ads right at the start of that clip in disagreement and there&#x27;s no way in hell that you can stop it. If you report it, what are you going to report it for? Now, I believe in freedom of speech, but that&#x27;s just immoral, as freedom of speech doesn&#x27;t imply forcing your opposition to present your case in their argument. And it&#x27;s not freedom of speech when your opposition is a multi-national with all the money it needs to buy whatever it wants.<p>So that&#x27;s why YouTube ads are immoral. Because they are more intrusive than normal ads and can be used for disinformation. And because I don&#x27;t use AdBlock, I limit my visits to YouTube. I used to use it for listening to music, but there are much better options for that.<p>What I don&#x27;t get from such services ... maybe I&#x27;m willing to pay a monthly subscription. That&#x27;s what I do with Google Apps. Why not give me the option to turn those ads off?",1385709311
