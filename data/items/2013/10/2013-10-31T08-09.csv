If there are no other textbooks / papers / patents were this phrase is used, this seems like a pretty strong indicator to me. A search on Google Scholar for that exact phrase gives (at the time) the two expected results. <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22computationally+impractical+to+reverse%22"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=%22computationally...</a><p>Alternative hypothesis: (a) Nakamoto paid close attention to research, read the patent and liked the phrase. (b) The phrase is common lingo, but Google Scholar doesn&#x27;t index it. For example, it could be used in a private mailing list. Both (a) and (b) seems like they could quite easily be investigated by someone with domain knowledge together with some knowledge of how patents are distributed.<p>This seems like too simplistic a reasoning. Anyone care to explain what I am missing?<p>EDIT: The exact phrase &quot;computationally impractical&quot; seems to be very common, with thousands of citations before 2008 <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22computationally+impractical%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&as_ylo=&as_yhi=2008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22computationally+impra...</a> It seems to me that reversibility might simple have been a &quot;theme&quot; in crypto circles around that time, which could explain the coincidence that two different groups independently glued the phrases together.",1383209642

I had no clue what affiliate marketing was or how it worked; I read a spam email by a company doing it and it sounded like  it was worth a try. It worked; it converted like mad and my income from this side project rocketed. The company invited me to one of these vacation things on a ship; the people I met there... I like the affiliate concept but indeed a lot of companies and people involved are just borderline criminals.

The policy can be different, based on the userbase and the tools being used, but limiting the mechanism to disallow bad policies is wrong.<p>While you can create a page-long listing of filename troubles, in practice <i>these shell users</i> only end up having to account for filenames with spaces in them. Occasionally you have to <i>rm --</i> an accidentally created file. Nobody uses those crazy filenames with leading and trailing space, escape codes, and newline characters because it means trouble with the shell. So the problem kind of takes care of itself.<p>But there might be some future user interface that doesn&#x27;t have the escaping and expansion problems of current shells and with that it might be useful to be able to put nearly any character into filenames.

But I&#x27;ve never seen a human make filenames with a leading hyphen (plenty with hyphen within the word) nor with a newline.<p>I could imagine that somewhere there is a person or two that likes to make hyphen-led filenames to try and sort things, but this is catering to the outliers.

It has plenty of features for achieving the same goals--say modularity--but there is no 1:1 mapping between those features and Ruby features. Or any OOP features at all.<p>Basically, you can do the same things but not necessarily in the same ways. For example, Haskell does not have any inheritance the way OO languages do, so that simply doesn&#x27;t come up. This doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s less capable--it just means it&#x27;s different. Very different.<p>One example is interfaces: in Haskell, depending on the context, you might use the module system, typeclasses or even just normal types to accomplish the same things as an OOP interface. You can still organize your code in a similar way, but the actual mechanics are different. In fact, since Haskell allows you to explicitly control effects, you have <i>more</i> organizational power!<p>I hope this clears things up. Ultimately, the details of how you can organize things is going to vary per use case. Perhaps the easiest thing to do is just to pick up basic Haskell and see what larger Haskell programs look like.",1383208221
