It&#x27;s like Xerox PARC or Microsoft Research, except Google is taking the step to capitalize on those projects for PR reasons as well. I doubt they will have more success in getting things to market and making a business out of something from their research labs than Microsoft (so that it shifts the revenue mix from 94% ads to anything else).  It&#x27;s important for them to be seen as &quot;innovative&quot; so that the company doesn&#x27;t become a stodgy old web company like AOL or Yahoo.

6632400,comment,6626377,6626825,2,0,ekianjo,,,"Here&#x27;s a piece of a paper on this :<p><i></i>Deflecting a larger asteroid would require a heavier spacecraft, more time spent hovering, or more lead time. However, in the special case in which an asteroid has a close Earth approach, followed by a later return and impact, the change in velocity needed to prevent the impact can be many orders of magnitude smaller if applied before the close approach5. For example, the asteroid 99942 Apophis (2004 MN4), a 320-m asteroid that will swing by the Earth at a distance of about 30,000 km in 2029, has a small probability (10-4) of returning to strike the Earth in 2035 or 2036 (ref. 6). If it is indeed on a return impact trajectory, a deflection of only about 10-6 m s-1 a few years before the close approach in 2029 would prevent a later impact (A. Carusi, personal communication). In this case, a 1-tonne gravitational tractor with conventional chemical thrusters could accomplish this deflection mission as only 0.1 newtons of thrust would be required for a duration of about a month. Should such a deflection mission prove necessary, a gravitational tractor offers a viable method of controllably steering asteroid 99942 Apophis away from an Earth impact.<i></i><p>Coming from this article : <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7065/full/438177a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7065/full/438177a...</a>",1383029722

For some work (peer reviewed journals, work you hope other people to be able to reproduce, etc.) you need a higher standard.<p>I find that higher standard requires a significant amount more time, effort, and ultimately prevents me from accomplishing what I need to.<p>It depends on the application and how you&#x27;re using the result.  Most of the time, for me, it just doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>It may be worth noting that much of what i&#x27;m talking about is for personal understanding (e.g., baseball statistics) or is not mission critical and will never see the light of day.<p>Sometimes good enough is just that.<p>I do appreciate the thoughtful response you wrote.  But often my decision is this: do I spend 2 weeks trying to understand a technique, or do I spend 1 day using it, understanding that my analysis has limitations.  When you only have 1 day, my choice becomes &quot;do what seems like it will work&quot; or &quot;do nothing.&quot;\nI agree that more complex techniques (neural nets, etc.) may need more understanding.  But because they do, they are also inaccessible to me.<p>Maybe I can sum it up like this: it&#x27;s not always necessary to do an analyses in a completely scientifically sound manner, if I can answer the questions to my satisfaction.  Especially relevant when the other option is to not get anything done, and get stuck in a textbook trying to understand complex theory.<p>It&#x27;s bit me once in a while, but that doesn&#x27;t matter in what I&#x27;m doing.

The time of contact between Alaska Natives and others was much more recent in Alaska than elsewhere in the US. That contact brought with it a number of issues:<p>- disease: Flu and smallpox epidemics wiped out more than half the population in many villages. This was a traumatic event, that left many young people disconnected from their families and cultural groups.<p>- cultural suppression: Initial contact with Native groups often involved missionaries. While a few missionaries added to an existing culture without taking anything away, most missionary groups came in and told the Native population that their ways were of the devil, and they needed to drop what they were doing and take on Christian traditions. These efforts contributed to severe disconnects between generations.<p>- introduction of alcohol and other drugs: Combined with all of the other issues that led to young people feeling isolated, alone, and depressed, alcohol and other drugs have had devastating effects on villages, and on urban areas as well.<p>These are complex issues, and not issues that everyone feels comfortable talking about.

Turns out we share a common vision: to develop a phone platform that is modular, open, customizable, and made for the entire world. We’ve done deep technical work. Dave created a community. The power of open requires both.  So we will be working on Project Ara in the open, engaging with the Phonebloks community throughout our development process, as well as asking questions to our Project Ara research scouts (volunteers interested in helping us learn about how people make choices).</i>",1383026511

Converting to paying customer should include a positive reinforcement.<p>I would never be a customer of a service where the company tells me that I stole from them in the first place. For the DistroKid case I&#x27;d say stealing is a strong word for creating a few dummy user accounts. I&#x27;d guess many of us have asked friends to use Dropbox referral codes to sign up even when you know they might not continue to use the service.<p>If a legitimate person is caught stealing then one is ashamed and prefers other services.",1383026415
