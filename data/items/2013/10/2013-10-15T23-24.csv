6557176,comment,6549502,6552758,1,0,drewcrawford,,,"> but with service only capable of around 100mbit at the highest.<p>I can tell you from my direct personal knowledge, that my neighbors&#x27; and my combined speed through this ISP can exceed 200mbit, and there is another ISP available in this building that can exceed 110mbit.  We are getting a third ISP in 2014 that is several orders of magnitude faster, so that will be at least 3 lines to this 10-unit building that have objectively-measured speeds exceeding 100mbit.<p>It is entirely possible that this 200mbit+ backhaul is shared over multiple buildings, but if that is the case, I do not notice.  I move on the order of 25GB a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year, and consulting 2 years of router logs suggests that I have never dropped below 30mbit (e.g., assuming both endpoints are up).  That is sufficiently close to the performance of a dedicated line that moving any closer is irrelevant for any application I would ever have.<p>What I am saying is that this shared line is managed very well.  And it is reasonable expectation for a user of a shared line that it is managed well.  It is a reasonable expectation that the user achieve advertised speeds most of the time, and if this is unachievable, then the ISP should advertise achievable speeds.  My ISP is perfectly capable of advertising 200mbit (since it is objectively achievable) but instead they advertise 35mbit.  It is true that they do not <i>always</i> achieve 35mbit, but the performance is sufficiently close.<p>For example, it is at this very moment a peak time for a residential area.  A speed test suggests I can achieve 33mbit down (94% advertised speed) and 5.5 mbit up (110% advertised speed).  This is <i>well</i> within the margin of &quot;close enough&quot; for people who aren&#x27;t doing high-frequency trading.<p>> So you won&#x27;t get every house in a residential area.<p>Neither will you get every business in a business area.  You have not presented a basis upon which to believe that it is more likely for an ISP in a competitive market to get a business customer than a residential customer.  So if we assume the fill rate for a residence is 50%, we should assume a similar fill rate for businesses, and the geometric argument I presented still holds.<p>> If you don&#x27;t understand the agreement you signed, call your cable company.<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of me &quot;not understanding&quot; the agreement.  It&#x27;s a matter of it being objectively unclear.<p>The cable company is not the arbiter of what the agreement I signed means.  The meaning of the agreement is objectively determined by either a judge or the AAA, the application of contract law in the State of Texas, and a good dictionary.  Based on my knowledge of the forgoing, I believe that I could host an extremely high-traffic personal website within the terms of the agreement.<p>Would they like it?  No.  Will they threaten to cut me off as a customer?  Possibly.  Is it a violation of the agreement I signed?  No.  So here we have a situation where the <i>real</i> rules of the road (e.g., they will stop serving me as a customer if I do this) are not in fact the agreement I signed when I signed up for the service, but are arbitrary and unwritten decisions that are subject to the whim of some person at the ISP.  I am saying that your claim that most ISPs have clear and fair written rules is objectively false, because there is no rule in my agreement that prevents me from saturating my connection all the time, and yet there are unwritten rules that prevent me from doing so.",1381881432

6557145,comment,6555855,6555855,4,0,macrael,,,"I was just talking with my roommate about this last night. I think the most important realization is that it is impossible to only use Structured Thinking to make your decisions and that I was wrong to think I ever was. The way I see it, structured thinking allows you to outline all of the pros and cons of the various options in front of you (which then drives creatively coming up with other possible solutions) but that those pros and cons are often not directly relatable, so your decision as to which pros and which cons you will ultimately fulfill is impossible to make perfectly &quot;logically&quot; and instead is made somewhat intuitively. This is &quot;going with your gut&quot; and is a required part of every decision we make.<p>Somewhat more concretely: Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m trying to solve a specific problem for my product. I want to add a new, already designed, feature to my app. There are many many different ways this feature can be implemented. Thinking in a structured way helps us enumerate the various different properties of these options. It requires logical/structured thinking to work through &quot;if I implement API expansion only for has_one associations I can do this in the framework of the rails serializers I am already using&quot; and &quot;if I choose to accommodate has_many associations as well I will need to rewrite the code that now uses serializers. If I rewrite that code, I know that it will require more testing and will probably introduce bugs&quot; So here (obviously incompletely) logic has helped me think about all the consequences of the various different options, but there is no way to mathematically relate &quot;increased code complexity&quot; vs. &quot;solves the problem more completely&quot; vs. &quot;principle of least surprise&quot; vs. &quot;principle of immediate feedback&quot; vs. &quot;performance&quot; vs. &quot;code readability&quot; vs. etc. The phrase is, &quot;apples and oranges&quot;<p>So now that I can make many logical arguments in favor and against a number of different paths forward, a decision must still be made. And it&#x27;s hard for me to see how that decision is &quot;logical&quot; in any meaningful way. We obviously have heuristics for saying that &quot;in general, something that impacts the user negatively is more important than the code being ugly&quot; but these hierarchies are always fuzzy and they shift depending on the situation. Ultimately, when you choose which path to take, you are choosing which pros and which cons you believe to be actually most important in this moment.<p>So, logic is an important muscle to work because being better at it gives you access to more complete information about what all the possible consequences of all the possible actions are. But then, going with the flow is also important to practice, and getting better at it I think really comes with practice, because the more decisions you make and observe the outcomes of, the better you will get at having a sense of what the true balance of these apples and oranges should be.<p>Sort of an aside, but i&#x27;ve noticed recently that in many of the discussions I&#x27;ve had at work designing features the arguments rarely become heated because of the following:<p>Person Alpha: &quot;Well A implies B implies C, C is bad so we should not do A&quot;<p>Person One: &quot;Actually A does not imply B, therefore your thinking is wrong&quot;<p>When someone is wrong in a very discrete logical way, it&#x27;s easy for the discussion to adapt and move forward. However, the more common way for things to get intense:<p>Person Alpha: &quot;Well A implies B implies C, C is good so we should do A&quot;<p>Person One: &quot;Well X implies Y implies Z, Z is good so we should do X&quot;<p>Person Alpha: &quot;Well, C is a more important gain than Z, so we should do A&quot;<p>Person One: &quot;No, Z is more important than C!&quot;",1381881063

The reason homeownership can be a good investment is not because it appreciates in value, it&#x27;s because:<p>1) For a given residential property in a high-demand market, you can reliably extract annual rent equal to 4-5% of the value of the property in a high-demand market.<p>2) If you just live in the property, your expenditures are reduced by a slightly higher amount because you avoid the inefficiencies of the rental market.  Also, income is taxed, but reduced expenditures are not.<p>3) Homeowner&#x27;s insurance is usually a much better deal than renter&#x27;s insurance.  This of course varies based on where you live, but on average (in the U.S. anyway) you&#x27;ll get better rates for equal coverage if you own your home.<p>It has nothing to do with some insane notion that property values always go up.",1381880968

6557078,comment,6546524,6550019,1,0,zackmorris,,,"Unfortunately I&#x27;m unable to edit my post now because it&#x27;s too old.  For anyone finding this, cataflam is partially right, I had some typos but the math is the same.  I stand by using total power output per day to calculate efficiencies.  cataflam&#x27;s right that over a 24 hour period, you could say the average output would be 210 MW.  Here is the corrected version:<p>---<p>3 square miles is 7.77 square km. Just over 1 kW of sunlight falls per square meter, so I will round up and say that there are 8 GW falling on the plant total.  280 MW over 8 GW = 0.035.<p><i>So 280 MW of production is 3.5% efficient of peak irradiance.</i><p>BUT average irradiance is smaller than peak:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_hydroelectric_power_stations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_hydroelectric_p...</a><p>It looks like 5 kWh per m2 per day for Arizona, so that&#x27;s 5 kWh per m2 times 7,700,000 sq m = 38.85 GWh per day irradiance on 7.77 sq km. Assuming the plant can put out its maximum capacity for the 18 hours it runs each day, that&#x27;s 280 MW times 18 hrs = 5 GWh per day.  5 GWh over 38.85 GWh = 0.1287.<p><i>So it&#x27;s operating at almost 13% efficiency of average irradiance.</i><p>That is very good, considering that they are able to store heat much more cheaply and environmentally friendly than storing electricity in batteries.<p>The most important thing of all is that it doesn&#x27;t have to wait for innovations in photovoltaics. Anyone can buy land, set up parabolic mirrors, and tinker with forgotten heat engines like Stirling cycle engines or Tesla turbine engines that easily achieve 30, 40, 50% efficiency and approach the Carnot limit. Conversion of rotational motion from a turbine to electricity with a generator is a solved problem at 95% efficiency.<p>Oh and these plants can be supplemented by biomass, say biodiesel from algae or fuel pellets made of hemp. If that&#x27;s too granola for the fossil fuel industry, they can also use natural gas.<p>In fact if you study this long enough, you find that there are only two real hurdles: energy storage and connection to the grid (made difficult because of resistance from established utilities). Generation turns out to be relatively inexpensive because there&#x27;s a sea of free energy all around us. To put it in perspective, Grand Coulee dam puts out less power than the irradiance falling on the solar plant. It&#x27;s just more efficient at converting the motion of falling water to electricity:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_hydroelectric_power_stations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_hydroelectric_p...</a><p>It puts out 6.8 GW times 24 hrs = 163 GWh/day. That&#x27;s 33 of these solar plants. So every 100 sq miles (260 sq km) of desert is equal to the 324 sq km of area flooded by Grand Coulee.<p>Solar thermal is the hydroelectric of the future and uses less land, which will only improve going forward. IMHO this will someday dwarf wind and nearly eliminate intermittency issues.",1381880248

Sometimes there are invariants that are enforced at the input (at the system boundary) and so it is not necessary to always keep checking for NULL or validating inputs in every single internal function.<p>That is one good lesson I learned from Erlang. Check your inputs at the boundary then code for the &quot;happy&quot; path and let error result in quick and early failure.

So until you tell me of those specific reasons, I have no reason to believe in selection bias.<p>Now, there&#x27;s <i>another</i> sampling effect: maybe Big Biz simply hire (much) more developers than smaller businesses.  If 5% of Big Biz devs work on Ruby, and 10% of startup devs work on Ruby, but 90% percent of developers work for Big Biz, then your Ruby conference will still be 80% full of Big Biz devs without selection bias, even though Big Biz is twice as hostile to Ruby.",1381878296
