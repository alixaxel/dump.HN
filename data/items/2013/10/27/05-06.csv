I&#x27;d heard it was all multi-user and powerful like Unix.<p>The terminal _sucked_.  It was the same crappy DOS box I&#x27;d seen since, well, DOS days and Win3.1.<p>That lead me on an exploration of MKS, UWIN, Cygwin, and finally, Red Hat, over the course of a few months.

6620952,comment,6617732,6618722,1,0,e12e,,,"> It doesn&#x27;t make it any less real, but it does make it more cowardly.<p>I strongly object to the last few wars both Europe and the US has been involved in, to our foreign policy and to a lot of the policies that surround these conflicts. I still think a comment about &quot;cowardly&quot; tactics and strategies are unwarranted. Bravery is indeed a virtue, but in deadly conflict there isn&#x27;t really such a thing as &quot;fighting cowardly&quot;. There&#x27;s cautious, callous, heinous, smart and stupid -- but not really cowardly.<p>It&#x27;s a little like a front page story a few years back in Norway, when some Norwegian troops stationed in Afghanistan were interviewed, and called the insurgents IED-tactics &quot;cowardly&quot;. Said with a straight face by someone that had the latest equipment, aerial and satellite surveillance, areal and modern artillery support, sniper support, body armour, armoured vehicles, night vision and all other trappings of modern warfare -- fighting poorly equipped peasants that are subject to night raids where parts of entire families are boxed up and shipped across half the world never to be heard from again.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying that it wouldn&#x27;t <i>feel</i> cowardly when one of these peasants injured or killed someone with a sneakily placed IED -- but it&#x27;s just good tactics, it isn&#x27;t really <i>cowardly</i>. I mean, there wouldn&#x27;t be any more wars in these areas if the local people tried to fight &quot;fair&quot; whatever that is supposed to mean.",1382853252

It&#x27;s not deficit spending (until it is), it&#x27;s reinvesting profit to grow assets that are the body of the money monster.  (For Starcraft fans out there: It&#x27;s like being broke because of focusing on building SCVs.)<p>On the other side of the gorge of eternal peril: Cash is king, and should not be underestimated.   Or those with the war-chests may try to puke all over Bezos&#x27; cake by mistaking lack of current reserves for an actual weakness.

I had the misfortune of working with a few of the bad ones.<p>The ones that were capable (ie. competent) were great to work with, but there were some that were REALLY, REALLY bad.  People laughed (or cringed) when the bad ones did their job - and it was obvious they were inept.  It was so bad that I would consider these few women to be the worst I have -ever- seen (in 20+ years of a working career).<p>After a period of time, these women cracked and left because they could not cope with the situation.  If anything, I blame the management for putting the wrong people in these roles and emphasising their inability.  If anything, it may have backfired and created a perception that women just can&#x27;t do the job (which is far from the truth).  I remember them being away frequently on training, so there was no apparent lack of support that I could see.<p>Unfortunately, that&#x27;s what you get when you play numbers games.

What Reckitt (the maker of Suboxone) did was create a new dose in the form of a film that dissolves in your mouth.  Each film came in a seal packet that was difficult for children to open.<p>Once the patent for Suboxone was nearing expiration, Reckitt introduced the new film dose form and pulled the tablets off the market.  Once the patent expired, Reckitt asked the FDA to deny approval of any new generic forms of the tablets in the interest of public safety (in essence giving them an additional patent life as the film was a new patent).<p>The FDA didn&#x27;t believe the risk was enough to stop generic versions of Suboxone and two new generic forms were approved earlier this year [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.drugfree.org/join-together/government/fda-approves-two-generic-versions-of-suboxone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.drugfree.org/join-together/government/fda-approve...</a>",1382851290
6620885,comment,6620598,6620598,43,0,hristov,,,"There are some issues with this explanation. The main issue is that the rules of accounting have a very good provision to take into account investing into the future. It is called capitalization.<p>Thus, if a company spends money to build or acquire a new asset, it is called capital spending and it is not subtracted from the profits. Thus, for example, if a company had a million dollars of profit and decided to spend these million dollars on a new fulfillment center, they could spend the money for their fulfillment center and still report a million dollars in profit.<p>So it is not quite clear-cut to say that Amazon&#x27;s desire to build fulfillment centers around the world is costing them their profits. Those things should be capitalized and once they are capitalized they should not affect the profits. Amazon did in fact report significant capital spending (as one can see on their cash flow statement).<p>However, things are not that simple. Sometimes some expenses which are about building for the future and investing into new growth are not capitalized. This is the case because for some expenses the benefits are so uncertain and difficult to quantify that the SEC requires that they are reported as ordinary expenses instead of capital spending. These types of expenses tend to involve R&D and may include certain administrative expenses associated with growth initiatives.<p>Therefore, many companies that are trying to grow do report lower profits because they have those expenses that are associated with investment into future growth but are not capitalized. This may be the case for amazon. But it is a question to what extent it is the case for amazon. For example, they do capitalize software and website development for new products and websites. So one cannot simply say that they are showing losses because they are spending all the money on making great new products. But then again, they expense software development for existing products. So perhaps the losses are associated with new growth features that are built into existing software.<p>So all in all it is a big muddle and it is not at all clear whether amazon is an inherently highly profitable company that happens to be investing in the future, or they are wasting money, or their business model is just not that profitable.",1382851289
