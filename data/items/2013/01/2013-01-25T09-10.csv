The aim of root is certainly good. But the implementation of that idea, especially the overall design, is absolutely awful. It's understandable, it has grown over a long time and was written by physics experts, not software design experts. People who where used to Fortran and paw. The actual code implementation is bad but not hopelessly so. The interface is broken and because so many people are used to it, it will be hard to replace with anything new.<p>For Mainz experiment, we have or own code base. Not pretty, but because it's a lot more specialist, less confusing. I am working now on OLYMPUS, and we are using ROOT for that. I created a Framework for the analysis based on ROOT, trying to hide the most problematic areas and making it easier for use by the other collaboration members. Also trying to make them write programs, not ROOT macros. Every time I look up a new feature, I'm surprised that they managed to find a non standard way of doing it. 
My pet peeve? TH1D is a 1-d historgram class. What does TH1D.Clear do?<p>Wrong! It clears the histogram title and name, not the histogram itself. For that, you need Reset. It makes kind of sense if you know the class hierarchy, TNamed and all. But who remembers that? I saw this mistake in the wild a lot.<p>Protip: Gnuplot. While also a little bit arcane in its command language, it's for me the best tool to produce paper-ready plots. With the tikz terminal you can include it in your Latex flow, and with some Makefile trickery you can have e.g. \cites resolve correctly in plot labels. With numbering correctly reflecting the position of the plot in the paper!",1359107824

5114751,comment,5109052,5111420,3,0,nostrademons,,,"Psychologists have a concept known as ""self-complexity"" (wiki it).  Basically, it's our view of ourselves, in terms of the many attributes, relationships, skills, deficiencies, etc. we possess.  Someone who thinks of themselves in broad terms, filling many roles and with many aspects, is said to have a high self-complexity.  Someone who thinks of themselves in terms of only a single aspect has low self-complexity.  Think of ""I'm a world-class kernel C hacker"" vs. ""I'm an awesome C programmer"" vs. ""I'm a good programmer"" vs. ""I'm a decent human being"".<p>By itself, self-complexity is neither good nor bad, but it does have consequences.  High self-complexity buffers you against negative events or negative appraisals of those aspects you identify with.  Someone who's devoted their life to low-level kernel hacking is going to take it more personally when you say C is obsolete and only a fool would be involved in OS design in 2013.  Someone who also sees themselves as a husband and a father and a good friend and a church leader and not all that bad at Javascript web programming either is probably going to let it roll off them; they may think you're wrong, but they'll just shrug and say ""Whatever; you're entitled to your opinion"" and not bother to argue the point.<p>So no, it's not bad for new activities to become part of your identity.  It can be bad for them to become your <i>whole</i> identity, because it leaves you really vulnerable to outside attacks on your self-conception.<p>(On a side note, it seems to me that a lot of the Silicon Valley startup mythology is focused on encouraging low self-complexity and an obsessive focus on external success.  Now that I re-read some of PG's early essays, several of them seem actively harmful to one's mental health.  The YC application used to ask you ""How are you an 'animal'?"", in reference to an early essay where he suggested that successful startup founders often act like caged animals - as if denying your humanity is ""success"".)",1359107309

The points that stand out for me:<p>* High bureaucracy levels while dealing with it, which means cost, which means most small companies won't do it.<p>* You can't just quit your job and live in the US for a while, while looking for another one (or not). IT salaries make it absolutely possible to take a year off if you feel like it.<p>* No cleaning of the path to greencard. It's possible, especially when you come from a country with a large number of applicants, like India, that you won't receive a greencard before your second visa expires and you have to go back ""home"" for a year.<p>* Just like above, the limit of 2 applications.<p>Overall a very mellow step, which does not make me any more inclined to come and work in the states.

</code></pre>
If you have several different software teams all with different apps against the same database, it's a struggle to coordinate a refactor.<p>Often there's problems just because of subtle differences in assumptions made about data that aren't covered by the sparse type system that relational databases offer.<p>These are very common problems for businesses that are growing beyond their ""small business"" stage.<p><pre><code>    > You did not offer an alternative
</code></pre>
Here's some:<p>* services which offer synchronous lookups over HTTP.<p>* services which offer interaction by custom streaming protocol.<p>* pipelines of data along the lines of Drake, which was on the homepage yesterday. This is similar to the batch-processing approach that dominated the mainframe era.<p>Each of these have lend themselves to ""grandfathering"" APIs as stuff changes. So when you rely on them, your teams can be flexible in ways that aren't open to you when everyone is running against a shared schema.<p>Also, you can write those approaches in whatever language you like, rather than being restricted to the stored procedures combinations that your DB offer, which always have poor state handing and limited concurrency mechanisms, and generally have a quirky syntax as well.<p><pre><code>    > If the currently available SQL products don't allow
    > you to stream data effectively, and that's what you
    > need to do, then use something else.
</code></pre>
Once you have people starting to use a database for message passing, you'll develop an ecosystem of platform-specific stored procedures and the like.<p>Databasese get chosen for messaging not because they're a good solution for it, but because it's the lazy option.<p>Think of all the systems that start off as an access database on someone's desk, and then evolve into SQL server. And then people write several apps against them and the business is locked into the platform.<p>By the time you need streaming often you've already made decisions that lock you out of it.<p>The business can't justify a rearchitect on period-by-period accounting. So the business hits the schema harder and harder until no work is getting done. You end up with a large team of cranky database admins, testers and developers. They work hard but generate little value. Their lives are dedicated to trying to slowly shuffle the blob forward. Your infrastructure costs are now huge.<p><pre><code>    > My point was what people are actually doing for IPC
</code></pre>
I agreed with you on that from my open. And went on to make the point that - irrespective of that - it's a bad pattern.<p>There are things relational databases are effective solutions for. Messaging is not one of them. A schema should be owned and interacted with by one and only one codebase. Databases should not be used as ad hoc messaging systems.",1359106252
