4992054,comment,4991512,4991512,1,0,RyanZAG,,,"Reddit has done an excellent job of creating a 'celebrity platform' in which anybody can theoretically become a celebrity. This works in the same way that modern capitalism creates an environment where anybody can theoretically become rich.<p>The real issue for Reddit is that more users actively harms their bottom line, as the kind of dynamic content they have is incredibly difficult to cache well and has to be recalculated continuously in thousands of ways, unlike Google who can create a more static, long term view of data. The user base on Reddit is also heavily skewed towards high school and college students - and these are generally the hardest users to get direct revenue from. Reddit is also trying to take the Wikipedia approach of receiving money directly from user's, but Wikipedia's data is far easier to store and disseminate, and Wikipedia's audience is far more global and includes more members of society who are willing to donate.<p>Reddit is going to have serious problems with their current business model and user base, and their audience is extremely fickle - their whole site is based off a kind of popularity contest after all. I would not recommend investing.",1357023573

The one thing the disk can't do by itself is correct unrecoverable errors since by the definition the disk can't recover from them :-)<p>The combination of BMS and disk scrubbing at the RAID level should handle almost all of the issues that are pointed by the original post.<p>Though RAID scrubs can and do take a long time to complete, depending on the performance impact that you are willing to suffer on a continuous basis it can take a week or two to perform proper scrubbing.<p>Proper scrubbing would include not just reading the RAID chunk on a disk but to also read the other associated chunks from the other disks and verify that the parity is still intact. In RAID5 you will not be able to recover if the parity is bad as you won't know what chunk has gone bad.<p>I've been coding such systems for a while now and as a shameless plug would point to <a href=""http://disksurvey.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://disksurvey.com/blog/</a> if there are things of interest I'd be happy to take requests and write about them as well.",1357023394

Most people have no fucking clue what that is.<p>This doesn't change the fact that the problem can be easily solved. Your girlfriend getting lost after 10 years of browsing is something that can be solved in 10 seconds. When I said that everyone I know uses it, my point wasn't that everyone in the world uses it, it was that it's not so difficult to use Adblock that people won't use it once they're told about it.<p>> I have no idea what flavor of Google you use, but piratebay is not even among the top 15 results for Project X: <a href=""http://cl.ly/image/0R1K2z2V0O3z"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/0R1K2z2V0O3z</a>. Your search history is probably reflecting on your results.<p>I don't know why you're seeing those results, but not only did I search in an incognito window to avoid my search history biasing my results, personally I use private torrents almost exclusively, so my Google torrent search history is quite limited.<p>> Now look at this: <a href=""http://cl.ly/image/1x302r3g383I"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cl.ly/image/1x302r3g383I</a>.

There are bad sites out on the internet - who would have guessed?<p>> Third, no, a lot a people have absolutely no clue about the difference between 720p/1080p. It's not about being stupid, they just don't care enough.<p>Well, that's good, because on Netflix, most content is not even available in 1080p, and even when it is, it's not accessible on many devices. Hell, I've seen tons of stuff that isn't even in HD.<p>And most people can't tell the difference in quality between 720p and 1080p anyway, so what difference does it make which one they download?<p>> Fourth, there are plenty torrents around with crappy audio, either low volume, distorted or mono, specially for new releases. Your own experiences don't apply to everyone.<p>Please point me to some examples. And I'm not talking about crappy cams. I would never suggest watching a cam over going to a theater, if the experience is important for you.<p>The only reason for audio issues with a DVD or Bluray rip would be improper encoding, and such a release would just be ignored.<p>> Finally, yes, I do use Netflix daily and subtitles are a menu click away, and available for every video.<p>No, they are not. That is blatantly incorrect. I just logged into Netflix and opened a random TV show. There were only subtitles available in English. They only had a 4:3 480p video option. Please explain how this is an optimal experience again?<p>And Netflix is not really a valid comparison in any case, since the available content is horribly limited.",1357023062
