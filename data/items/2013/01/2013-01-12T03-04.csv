5046443,comment,5042735,5046373,5,0,beagle3,,,"> Hasn't this always been true about scientific papers? Descriptions can be verified by reproducing the experiment. Why is a paper any less trustworthy just because there's code involved?<p>It was always true to an extent.<p>Code is a force multiplier that makes it significantly harder to evaluate the paper with out it (and without reproducing an equivalent).<p>I'm not in academia myself, but I've heard from friends more than once that when they actually received code (and/or data) they requested from an author, the code turned out to be not precisely described in the paper, and the data is often massaged to fit in a way that's not precisely described either.<p>The question shouldn't be ""why aren't you satisfied with what was good 20 years ago?"", but rather ""when sharing the bits that makes everything reproducible is a 'git push' away, why isn't it considered mandatory?""<p>It is a common error that science is about proving things; The scientific method is actually about trying to disprove things and failing to do so. If what you want to do is science, why don't you make it easiest to disprove your results?",1357963007

In Chrome it's available in the settings.<p>> The popup is necessary because many plugin elements are too small...<p>How about a whitelist then, so that the main Flash applets on YouTube and other prominent sites with large, easy to locate Flash applets have a non-popup click-to-enable dialog (as is used by extensions like Flashblock)? That would cover 90% of use cases.<p>Also, how about an option to have click-to-play settings controlled on a per-plugin basis?

5046437,comment,5044862,5045435,2,0,SiVal,,,"One of my highest priorities for several years has been a full-page, portable PDF reader. My mountainous ""must read"" inbox is increasingly electronic instead of paper, with most of the serious stuff in PDF format. I can listen to fiction in audio format with half of my brain while grocery shopping with the other half, but my serious stuff requires my full brain capacity (or more) plus hi-rez graphs, equations, charts, maps, etc. to give me a fighting chance at figuring it out and learning something. These little eBook formats are fine for things that I could just as easily listen to in audio (if only they were available), but I need a better reader for my REAL stuff.<p>The iPad is the closest I've come, but I'd hoping for something more like a touch screen eInk reader in a form factor like the lid of my RetinaMBP.<p>It may be that those of use who read full-sized technical textbooks after graduation could all fit in the same elevator and aren't worth building devices for, but there must be a huge market for students reading textbooks and everyone else reading magazines. I hope I'll be able to piggyback on their market someday.",1357962762
5046436,comment,5045764,5046394,3,0,dekhn,,,"At least in my experience, most of the codes we expected to run were written in C or C++.  We would like to support Java, but it's not an option right now (Native Client doesn't support Java, and I'd need to research the Java sandboxing technologies).  Another issue is that we limit memory usage, and Java memory usage tends to be higher than C++ programs; ditto for virtualization.  Note that virtualization isn't really a security solution on its own.  I can't really see Ruby being the right approach for CPU-intensive computing (we're talking hundreds of thousands of cores, so it's worth investing in making the code efficient).<p>BTW, I definitely think seccomp <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seccomp</a>

If you take the slower ISP's and siphon away money from them to give to faster ISP's, they'll never have any hope of catching up. At that point, the leading ISP's can just sit om their duff, because the other ISP's are basically paying to cement them in the lead.<p>This is true even if you separate rural and urban ISP's. Verizon has a great network in the DC area. If they win, then say a Houston ISP subsidizes them. At that point they have zero incentive to improve. Moreover, people in Houston are stuck with even worse service, because money that might be spent on capital expenditures in Houston are going to pad Verizon's profits in DC.<p>You're overly focused on the incentive part of the equation and ignoring the underlying market dynamics.",1357962005

challenge [1], which is the standard benchmark for evaluating object detection
performance in computer vision.<p>Object detection is an extremely tough problem (some would say it is <i>the</i> computer vision
problem ;-)), and while we've made a lot of progress in the past decade, the best
methods are still terrible [2] -- average detection precision between 30-50%.
For reference, most consumer applications require an AP of 90+% to be considered
usable.<p>So if this is a completely automated solution, it's not going to be able to do
much better, unless the creators can make <i>massive</i> (I mean orders-of-magnitude)
improvements on the state-of-the-art.<p>But that being said, there are some applications where lower performance is
acceptable. And if you add some manual verification, you could conceivably
make this much better (with an increase in latency, though). Another possibility
is to specialize on a certain type of input image (e.g., if you're a company
taking photos in your warehouse, where all your photos look very similar and/or
you can control the lighting and environment).<p>Still, I'm excited to see companies attempting to take object detection out to
the real world.

They spent half the budget on interconnect, and don't want it wasted.  It's entirely possible the OP's project allows them to run embarassingly parallel codes, but frankly, that's just a waste of energy given what the hardware is capable of.  I had this argument when I worked at the supercomputing centers, over and over (I told them to build loosely coupled commodity clusters with great storage IO throughput) but they never saw my point of view, so instead I built exacycle and work to make it available to scientists who can keep it busy.<p>With regards to sharing scientific information related to pharma, I (and the rest of the Exacycle team) believe strongly that the results the Exacycle Visiting Faculty achieve must be made public- ideally all the raw data in addition to the published analysis.  If you look at the blog post I referenced, you'll notice that three of the faculty are working on protein/drug related problems, and we'll be sharing the bulk of the results with the scientific community.<p>The work we've done has moved protein folding and drug design far beyond incrementalism.  The scale we make available also turns things that were 1-10 year projects and makes them an overnight job.  I also spent a year running MD simulations on a supercomputer, so I can appreciate the higher level of scientific productivity that a system like Exacycle provides.<p>Some of the questions you raise about cloaked IP sharing are interesting, mainly from a theoretical perspective, but I think pharma would be more likely to use existing IP protection mechanisms, or they would simply not collaborate at all, before adopting stuff as ""complicated"" as this.",1357960735

Otherwise, genetic algorithms are going to get clobbered in performance by almost every other algorithm.<p>Which brings me to my point : imho the chances that humans are capable of real original thought is nil. Don't get me wrong, humans are very capable of creatively combining ideas from very different disciplines and non-human sources to arrive at surprising insights and works.

For such proteins, the structures <i>can</i> be determined experimentally. That means coaxing pure samples of protein to form single crystals and then subjecting the crystals to X-ray diffraction (XRD). Backing out the structural information from the XRD patterns takes serious horsepower (though admittedly not necessarily power with Titan-class interconnects). XRD does not give information about the location of hydrogen atoms in the structure though. For that information you need to do neutron diffraction (the de Broglie wavelength of the neutrons is short). ORNL is actually one of the few places that do neutron diffraction. The OP could connect with some of the neutron folks there and assist them with their research. If not for proteins, maybe for superconductors.<p>I had a chance to run some Monte Carlo code on some of the machines at ORNL as part of a supercomputing workshop there during the reign of Jaguar.
