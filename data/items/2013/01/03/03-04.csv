If you think of all parameter lists as tuples with some anonymous type, [un]packed transparently like Python parameter lists, then a multimethod defines a type class with one method (itself), the set of parameter lists to which it can be applied.

Maybe you can do more with it.<p>Figuring out what type classes have to do with implicit parameters will take more than one afternoon of reading.

Unfortunately, Ubuntu doesnt figure in the equation. Tablets, phones are all locked down devices and enthusiast/hobbyist open source doesnt figure unless drivers are available. To maintain relevance, Ubuntu needs to exist in the mobile space.<p>Todays announcement is an early one, and is making the same value proposition as Android did early on, before Googles acquisition. i.e. an open source system that any phone vendor can use to build their smartphone platforms on.<p>The Problems<p>Ubuntu has a remarkably polished desktop product for years but it has remained a fringe product and the PC market has simply stopped growing. Jobs has carefully taken Apple around MSs hegemony on the desktop by tackling music players first, then a pincer movement through Windows Mobile dominance by producing a very expensive smartphone.<p>Shuttleworth faces not one but several well established and cashed up competitors  Apple, Google/Samsung, Amazon. I havent even mentioned Microsoft, or the Chinese Korean and Taiwanese versions of a smartphone OS. Each of them have an arsenal of patents and services that gives them degrees of freedom to move around the space. Google for example commands the email/contacts/calendar integration, YouTube, Maps and Navigation. Googles approach is to deny competitors full functionality of these services to cripple their smartphone offerings. e.g. turn by turn in the case of iOS, YouTube search APIs in the case of Windows Phones. Apple and Amazon have offered cloud locker services for those who purchased music and books from their online stores. Microsoft has some cards left in enterprise management and server integration.<p>Next steps<p>I believe this is just an initial salvo. Promising compatibility with Android kernel level drivers is a good start. Right now there isnt enough value proposition for Ubuntu phone in terms of apps or services. Integrating a phone and desktop are novel but it is far from a sure bet. A reference phone design might be good bet if they think it will persuade some of the smaller Chinese manufacturers to jump onboard. However, this will not please Dell. It might make a MIUI-like play, and remain a niche phone OS for several years until the opportunity is right.<p>What Ubuntu really needs to do now as an organisation is to make a sideways bet into iOS and Android. It needs to kick start development of its own mail app, or acquire a navigation maker like Waze, and get these loaded onto the popular phones today. There is still some geek-cred left in Ubuntu for people to load these apps on, and who knows, they might catch on in the enterprise space.",1357182942
