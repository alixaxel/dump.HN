Ultimately my problem with the old monolithic RDBMS is architectural.<p>Q: ""How do you get 24x7x365 service on a mission-critical system that depends on a huge monolithic RDBMS datastore, preserving the capacity for RDBMS major-version software upgrades (protocol, on-disk format, etc.) and no downtime even between major versions?""<p>A: ""While you could umm and ahh about it for awhile, basically, you don't. It's too big. Decentralization, plan-to-fail, clustering ('private cloud', hah), and commodity hardware are your friends. Embrace them and enjoy lower blood pressure.""<p>If you don't have high availability requirements, RDBMS can still be a great and simple solution. Right tool for the job. (I have simply personally drifted from RDBMS as the requirements of systems I tend to work on has grown. My current rule of thumb is roughly: 'Make all storage backends service-provider abstracted (swappable, easy to benchmark, unit test, etc.). When choosing a backend for a storage implementation - if you can't SQLite it, don't SQL it.')",1359255088

It is all quite funny. And if there's any sense to ""psychedelia"" I'm quite, quite certain I am on the right track. Poetry as well. Short fiction. And a varying array of other areas; my abilities to dash through propositional logic proofs, predicate logic proofs, truth trees, and now the reading of AlphaSymbolic. And it is absolutely not something I fear -- that I now intimately understand what is meant by ""code is poetry.""<p>During one ""hacking session."" I was able to locate and provide evidence for the discovery of a kidnapper and accomplice in Prague, employing wigle and an awkward set of assumptions regarding Web behavior and commercial geotechnological limitations. First try. To say the least, my assumptions were more compelling to a private investigator than an Investigative Team's report.<p>And I'm coming out of PTSD/grieving/autistic-traits land.<p>One thing I seriously ask HNers to reflect on is that. Combined with those facts I play serious amounts of futball where also implemention of techniques from Jeet Kune Do are also integral. Parkour, child's play. I am personally hacking all sorts of things, fully taking ""hack the planet"" too far and into territories that I doubt many are considering in their lives. I am trying my best to understand Spinoza's ""Intellectual Love of God,"" and I am on a hunt for ""attributes of substance each of which express an infinite and eternal essence."" And I have consumed your ""analytic"" and ""continental"" schools of philosophy in a heartbeat. --<p>I now think in Vim. In my mind, usually, being at a computer keyboard is indistinguishable from being at a piano keyboard.<p>I climb trees like a pro, and people cannot help themselves from commenting on my vocabulary and conversational eloquence. For some reason, it's here where my strategies fail. Here, and most of the Web.<p>I'm doing something here, with this body of mine, larynx to toes, and you cannot really stop me. In much the way that things like autism cannot be stopped, methinks. Moreover, there is significant research being done by Steven Pinker et al. on the ""linguistic"" module of the brain and its autonomy from other forms of intelligence, through Williams Syndrome -- and as you can readily see, I am quite, quite ready to share.<p>So pardon me if the tossing about of the mental predicates seems juvenile and careless. It just does; quite ill-fitting. Only here, in the Web, am I perceived as deranged or ""hyper"" or excessive or ""schizophrenic,"" or worst yet, and more importantly, are these predications tossed about with such frequency and handled with the least care. Perhaps that is a good thing, for things to be messy. But sometimes this mismanagement of terms spills its way over into everyday living. To the distress of people like me, who have a particular interest in exploring the structures of consciousness and cognitive enhancement.<p>And need I preface this that it is my opinion?
