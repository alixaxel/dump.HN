If they started doing their projects in C, with the current growth in rate of complexity they will never finish their projects ever.<p>>>No wonder Facebook noticed this and desperately trying to compile Php to C.<p>Dynamic languages aren't slower because they are not C. They are slow because they do a lot of magic. C is fast because the magic is left for you to perform. I can't see how any one pull out pace out of compiling Php to C directly, unless they sacrifice things along the way. Which really defeats the purpose of using Php at the first place.<p>>>Well, long story short, with his help another developer converted it to Java in short time it worked around 200 times faster. So there. Moving bits around did not help Perl here at all.<p>Number of programmers who even need to here the word 'bits' in their day to day activities(Talking of application programmers) are rare enough to make their case totally exceptional.<p>Besides there are places where C makes perfect sense. There is hardly any other language heard of in the embedded programming world.",1359431993

I was disappointed, most of them didn't even understand what interfaces were for (no wonder ruby hasn't added them yet), let alone knowing the most basic design patterns. They also seem to enjoy laughing at developers from other languages. All this was a pain to watch, but I didn't care as long as Rails was perfect, and that's how I felt about it at first.
