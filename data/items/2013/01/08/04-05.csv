Oh man, 2009 was a good year :)<p>I'll echo what skates and iba said -- battlecode was probably one of the most productive things I did in school. when everyone else is trying to teach you how to properly to document your preconditions, battlecode is purely about GSD (get s<i></i>* done) - an extremely valuable lesson for an aspiring young entrepreneur.<p>my favorite battlecode hack: we used to assign a fixed ""cost"" to certain methods, namely Arrays.hashCode(). one of the more experienced players figured out that everyone was using this to checksum their radio broadcasts. he then proceeded to reverse engineer the hash code algorithm and spam teams with enormous messages that had legitimate checksums but were actually just megabytes of trash! the poor opponents would just sit there chewing cpu until the engine finally killed them for using too much heap :)<p>edit: actually read through cory's post - glad to see he already mentioned this one!",1357621134

Although to get US citizen services in Baghdad was really complex; despite it being inside a fairly secure area (the ""Green Zone""), I wasn't allowed to carry inside, had to make an appointment a week in advance, etc. I ended up just making friends with people at a nearby heliport who had badges to escort me in.

As well as just being fun people, they really help me to navigate (and organize) social situations and to meet new people.

Yet, people generally believe that group brainstorming is more effective than individual brainstorming. Further, group members are more satisfied with their performance than individuals, whereas they have generated fewer ideas.""<p>I've never judged the productivity of a group session by the number of ideas produced.  I think that's a terrible measure.  I judge it by the quality of the few that the group settles on by the end.  And in my experience, group sessions produce ideas of a quality that I could not have produced by myself.  When working with good people, we riff off each other and fill in the gaps in each other's ideas that we wouldn't have even realized were there if we were working on our own.<p>It's very hard to spot your own weaknesses.  I'm convinced that feedback is great and that getting out of your own head is great, and a good meeting can deliver that.  Not always, of course.  I'm a programmer.  I like my me time, and I'm definitely not arguing for group work all or even close to most of the time.  But I'm definitely a better person for the trips I take away from my shell.",1357617663
