It's also very difficult because those days everyone's a photographer, and anyone who uses a filter is an art photographer. If she has a solid BFA background and has put in some serious years work then that would be much more rewarding. As HCB said ""the first 10,000 photos are your worst"". Freelancing in the art world is not easy, there a lot of brand building and making sure she's represented in the right places, obviously the next event that she should consider is Photo LA",1357102748

4995360,comment,4994817,4995300,18,0,kabdib,,,"> Experience means very little<p>Perhaps. But I believe that good engineers have a number of cool failures in their past.<p>> Because I can capture 70% of your experience in your code -- in your library -- and build directly on top of it<p>You can capture /some/ of someone's experience this way. But don't confused the ability to _use_ the novel Moby Dick with the ability to _write_ Moby Dick. These are two very different things.<p>Let's talk about this hypothetical library for a minute.<p>1. It's a finished product. You didn't experience the design process.  You didn't see the things that were tried and which failed. All you see is the shiny object. Could you make another like it?<p>2. Since you missed out on the design interaction, you're missing out on the stuff that was left out for the next version. You weren't there for the discussions about alternatives (maybe better ones).<p>3. If you treat the library as a black box, you're going to be at the author's mercy for bug fixes, making improvements, or doing integration in environments where it doesn't exactly fit.<p>4. Ultimately, abstractions are lies. The best ones are white lies, the worst ones paper-over or ignore fundamental problems. (My favorite example is putting a database on top of a Unix file system: How do you know when data is stable on disk? What /is/ a commit, anyway?) How much of that library do you really believe?<p>I've seen some really interesting product failures resulting from ""unthinking isolation"" -- perhaps a better term would be ""false abstraction"" -- of what was happening in the system at the hardware level. We're talking bricks and user data loss because someone thought that transactions weren't important. Performance is another area where it's hard to abstract (and some platforms, such as video game consoles, are all about performance).<p>Good, reliable systems should be designed with all layers in mind. That's where experience starts to matter.",1357102186

4995329,comment,4994284,4994284,3,0,dizzystar,,,"Thanks for the write-up. As a Clojure user, I really hope the language takes off, but I think the collective world isn't going to move much until there is a long list of projects that have been created using Clojure and people have real access to those who did it before. Obviously, there is Light Table and similar projects, but it will take a Reddit-level site to really push it into ubiquity. For example, I have two websites that are exclusively written in Clojure, though neither of them are impressive pieces of software (job ""portal"" and ""blog""), but honestly, no one cares about my small piece of the world. Of course, if anyone ever got stuck with something and needed advice, I would be more than happy to offer pointers.<p>I think the other thing that will help -- and I can't imagine that there is much want from the Clojure community -- is a massive framework a'la RoR / Django. I definitely wouldn't use such a framework, but I think many people and professionals are to clung to the idea of these frameworks. Clojure, in its current state, demands a fearlessness that may not be viable for wide adoption.<p>With Clojure hosting so easy and affordable on Heroku, I can see a possibility for a Drupal- / WP- type CMS being viable.<p>I'm definitely going to pick up your ClojureScript book.

For example, authentication - Ive seen it done somewhat differently on every product Ive worked on not to mention the different languages and coding styles used.  Most programmers enjoy the mental process of crafting their own implementation and there is usually a real reason for custom development - every product is a little bit different.<p>The bad... we seem to have to continually be rewriting custom implementations of very similar things which equals cost and usually mediocre reliability.  We barely even have adhered to guides for something as common as authentication (at least that anyone pays attention to).  This is quite vastly different than other professions.

A corporation or a business is accountable to its shareholders but not to society at large. And it's mostly accountable to shareholders in the ""get us more money"" way, and not the ""be ethical and do good"" way. A corporation is only accountable to society in as much as they are accountable to the law (passed by the government).<p>Note that in most cases you cannot even ""vote with your wallet"".<p>For one, because the harm they do might happen thousands of miles away from where consumers are (as it often happens) so buyers don't care. For another, because even if the harm is domestic, it doesn't necessarily affect the same people as those buying (e.g, treating workers badly or dumping toxic waste in a river in South Dakota doesn't directly affect consumers in the rest of the 50 states).<p>><i>What you call a democratic government is still less accountable than a normal capitalistic business, and I'll argue that the government is strictly less accountable, because the government is the only organization (with a few potential counter examples) that can and does use a massive campaign of organized violence to maintain and exercise power</i><p>The difference is that the government must balance millions of expectations and demands, whereas a corporation does not. A government must at some deegree satisfy it's voters, must keep the main opposition at bay, must be accountable to foreign powers (diplomatic agreements, ecological treaties etc), cannot favor a corporation or a lobby too much because of counter-action of opposed lobbies, etc. Plus there are binding documents it has to follow to some deegree, from the constitution to common law.<p>A company has far fewer such restraints.

Or more precisely the semantics of making a 'call' from one context to another, where anything can happen between point A and point B. The sorts of challenges were things like ""at most once"" semantics where the programmer could assume that if a function call completed it did so only one time on the destination, or ""receiver makes it right"" data exchange where the person receiving the data is responsible for unmarshalling it into something intelligible. Sun's RPC layer was very light weight, HP/Apollo (and later Microsoft under the same guy) was quite heavy weight.<p>Process migration was another interesting bit, and something I think we'll see more of in the future. At Blekko we don't run a program (called a mapjob) against a petabyte of data, instead we send that program to all of the 'shards' and run it in all those places at once. This 'networking as execution' is one of the things I experimented early on with in Java. We had network management software which needed to manage bits of gear, and I devised a set of classes which presumed a JVM and basic set of classes on the target, then packets were themselves simply byte codes to be executed at the target. I had a kind of hacked up JVM at the time which used a capabilities model rather than the security manager model, I was concerned that you were essentially injecting code into a remote device you really wanted to be sure it couldn't do anything unexpected!<p>Basically having objects that can serialize themselves and move from station to station depending on what they are trying to do is a useful abstraction for some problem sets.",1357100634

I can write a pretty reliable program to compute sin/cos tables or to sort a phonebook or to do some basic projectile trajectory.  But those aren't even table stakes anymore.  Today a first year undergrad student might be expected to write a program that in 1970 the most advanced programmer in the world couldn't do with a large team and millions in funding.<p>I hate the analogy to other fields of engineering (and this author doesn't fall down that trap, but plenty do).  Bridges haven't changed in the past 10 years the way programs have (in terms of functionality or complexity).<p>And lastly, this is IMO, a corollary for why ageism is so persistent in our field.  Experience means very little.  Why?  Because I can capture 70% of your experience in your code -- in your library -- and build directly on top of it.  I don't actually need you.  There are few other fields where as much of your experience can be captured in something so reusable (despite our constant protests that code isn't reusable -- it's more reusable than any output from my plumber).<p>Programming is terrible because we obsolete ourselves by moving technology out of our own grasp.  The fact that newer programmers don't understand the foundation they build on is irrelevant, since few need to look behind the current.  Unfortunately, I think it is simply the nature of the beast.

Many of his examples don't seem like humblebrags at all--like the Dina Manzo example about hot weather. Really??<p>Secondly, perhaps the reason humblebragging is so frowned upon is because we discourage just straight up bragging. That's fine and all, but for Christ's sake sometimes we work really damn hard for what we have that we should all be allowed to brag a little every now and then. If you busted your ass building a product and you lost so much sleep over it, and the product itself rocks, wouldn't you want to brag a bit? If you bust your ass at the gym and exert enough discipline to stick through a tough diet over the course of a year, wouldn't you be tempted to show off your results?<p>One of the main reasons bragging is a faux pas, in my opinion, is because too many jealous and insecure people become butt hurt. That's the truth. I've never understood why you can't show off once in a while. You hit the gym really hard and diet, but if you post a photo of your results on Facebook--assuming the results are amazing (i.e. you're really ripped and you look great)--you're suddenly vain. You spend countless hours of practice and frustration over an instrument and show your results on Twitter - someone is bound to call you a show-off.<p>The reason I'm so tired of humblebragging is because I feel like people should just own it. Are you talented? Did you work really fucking hard for what you have or what you've accomplished? Did you suffer blood, sweat and tears to get to where you are now? Then show off a little. I encourage it. If you earned everything you have, if you've paid your dues and are now fit/successful/talented, fuck what everyone else thinks and screw all the jealousy. They're haters.<p>While we're at it, I'd like to clear up what a hater is: A hater is someone who is jealous and insecure and probably isn't very good at doing much. However, let's be absolutely clear on this: If your products/efforts/skills/knowledge are piss-poor or not up to snuff, the people who criticize you aren't haters, they're simply telling you the truth and you just can't accept it.",1357100081

The attacks dropped off when I stopped saying things like ""thanks"" but it also left me in a position where most people seem to not know how to talk to me at all. I am only just now making in roads into getting people to actually talk to me again. It has been very very tough. But it seems to be improving.",1357099311

You have no idea how hard my job is. I just sold my business for $200 Million but some of you still don't take me seriously because I don't know how to program.""<p>Tech cofounders have, rightfully, learned to eschew sketchy/crappy/douchey business co-founders. Sometimes the generality of ""business guy"" takes the fall with that. The truth is that it's a lot easier to fake having the potential to be a CEO than it is to fake having the potential to be a CTO. If you've ever noticed how ready marketers/business guys are to throw out their credentials, that's because until you have at least a somewhat successful startup under your belt, you can't be taken seriously. You have no tangible skill. You're a liability.<p>The author wants technical co-founders to know what it's like to be him for a minute.",1357099272

The nay-sayers argument that 'micro kernels are slow' seems to be mostly limited to those that have never actually used a micro-kernel based OS for anything. What I remember was - for the time especially - nothing short of astounding performance, 30K slices / second on a lousy 486/33 was not exceptional at all.
