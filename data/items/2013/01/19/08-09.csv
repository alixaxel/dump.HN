(I mean ""infrastructure"" as holding and sending bits, while ""access"" is your link + key so people can unwrap all the way to the gooey content).<p>The post is right that enforcement can still find and takedown access that is broadcast.<p>But short messagaes (ie, access) are easy to keep alive through backchannels, while downed infrastructure stays down a while.<p>Here's one way content could become relatively takedown-proof with everyone following somewhat normal behavior on MEGA:\nUser uploads content, shares with 20 friends. After getting notification that 20 or so people have downloaded,* pulls the content offline (maybe reuploads to a private link). Friends possess the content and their own MEGA accounts. Several friends repost to MEGA, and you have second generation sharing, now reaching 100 or so people. The cycle continues, spreading content increasingly quickly, but building liability firewalls behind each degree of separation, any takedown impacts a dwindling fraction of the overall sharing population.<p>(The post claimed this was just like lending a DVD to a friend. Yeah, sort of, except now it can be shared instantly, remotely, and to dozens of people simultaneously.)<p>* No idea if this will be a MEGA feature, I assume it will be.",1358585978

5082984,comment,5080210,5082609,3,0,hosay123,,,"While a fan of your original comment, I think the logic got a little flaky here. Claiming any language is 'close to the metal' is to make implicit reference to particular implementations of said language. In recent years there has been an explosion in the use of techniques that have levelled this old distinction.<p>For example today it is quite possible to have Javascript OO code that runs more efficiently than, say, calling through structs of function pointers in C, since modern compilers have morphed into such strange runtime beasts that they can make (and test at runtime for) stronger assumptions about the contents of those pointers than a traditional compiler ever could. Where an indirect call in a traditional C compiler will only ever be at best ""CALL [rax]"" (assuming no indirection required to implement dynamic linking), newer implementations might inline the called function entirely, all dependent on what input the program happens to have been fed on a particular run.<p>This trend is why I'm not certain of the odds for less expressive languages in medium term. Instead of a struct of function pointers, imagine an inheritance chain of structs of function pointers. Although it can be implemented in C it is a native concept in Javascript, and one that compilers can already optimize. While the JS compiler has explicit information fundamental to the language to infer this structure from (and version any dependent objects to implement a runtime guard), we aren't nearly at the point where our compilers can deduce such an idiom in C or assembly, optimize for it, or solve a huge satisfiability problem at runtime in order to produce guards for it.<p>It naturally follows that the more semantic information a compiler has available to it, the better chance, at least in the medium term (10-20 years?) it has of applying tractable optimizations.",1358585645

5082978,comment,5080001,5080001,5,0,particular_,,,"DISCLAIMER: This post focuses more on the Goenka courses than Vipassana meditation per se.<p>I'm quite surprised that no dissenting opinion has yet surfaced on the topic of Goenka's courses. Most of the commentor's opinions here seem over-enthusiastic, describing the Goenka retreat as 'the best thing in [their] lives'. To me, this is a serious warning sign.<p>I have attended a 10-day retreat, which ended prematurely (on the evening of the 8th day) because of my refusal to watch the evening lectures. While I must agree with the commentors' positive opinions on the meditative experience, I feel compelled to inform any potential attendees that despite claims of 'scientific rationality', the Goenka group is a regular religious sect.<p>When the course begins, the Vipassana technique is presented as an objective tool to achieve insight into the workings of one's own mind and emotions. Mr. Goenka presents himself as someone who merely happened to learn of the technique and is now passing it on.<p>As the days progress, the scarce sleep and food schedule begins to take its toll on the participants' bullshit detectors, and subtle religious notions are slipped into the agenda. These include:<p>* The primacy of Vipassana over other religions\n* The unreasonableness of other religions\n* The unquestioned truth of reincarnation\n* The fact that our bodies are made up of some kind of vibrations<p>I remember finally 'snapping out of it' when Goenka started talking about bubble chambers( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chamber"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chamber</a> ) and the depressed scientist who made them. My bullshit detector went on overdrive and I thought about all the things that had been said up to that point during Goenka's video lectures and his taped talks. I realized that I had been subtly manipulated into accepting certain ontological truths, such as the above. These were not things I would have readily accepted coming to the retreat.<p>I also realized I had been planning to continue with Vipassana practice and make it part of my life. Maybe help organize retreats in my home country. Become part of this 'wonderful' movement headed by Mr. Goenka. This was definitely not something I had in mind when I signed up for the course.<p>I know I will not convince anyone who is already engaged with the Goenka group to rethink how they got involved, but I would like to sincerely warn anyone who is considering attending:<p>You will not be alone with your thoughts and emotions during these ten days. You will be accompanied by <i>THE RECORDED VOICE OF GOENKA</i>, for 2-3 hours of each and every day. Every meditation will start with his talks and chants, every meditation will end with his talks and chants. From what I understand, but have obviously not experienced firsthand, the grueling 9-day course ends with a Love-bomb (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_bombing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_bombing</a>). I believe these 'free' courses are set up to lure susceptible people into the organization.<p>Please look into some critical views on any religious group before engaging with one. On the internet, smears abound, but you may also find some grounded critique that may shine light on the structure and purpose of the organization.",1358585309

5082975,comment,5046455,5050980,1,0,Gormo,,,"There's certainly historically been a great deal of UI experimentation out there, but in the past, it's been limited in context: entirely new UI paradigms, as I remember, we're often tested out in entirely new products designed around the UI concept - which often succeeded or failed in the market due to the UI's influence - or we're gradually fleshed out as R&D projects over long periods of time.  But anything more than incremental UI paradigms used to have to prove themselves before they ended up as the default UI of well-established software products' shipping releases.<p>It just seems like there's a tendency for new versions of existing products to have in their release notes something along the lines of ""added: entirely new grounds-up UI design, based on experimental concepts, that bears little resemblance to previous UI"".  E.g. Ubuntu Unity, Gnome 3, Windows 8; ironically, Apple currently offers the most conservative and predictable desktop UI among currently-shipping OSes.<p>This doesn't really relate to the state-vs.-action question directly, except that I thing both may be related to a current tendency to emphasize visual aesthetics over functional consistency.",1358585119
5082974,comment,5079160,5079160,1,0,Gorbzel,,,"So, perhaps I'm spoiled: I was born and raised in Las Vegas. and CES is just another expo. Heck, this year I made it down to the actual show floor once for a few hours max. Yet I also feel the pain of spending a ton of effort in trying to get a startup to pitch at a show; my first startup was in a niche industry that held its largest major convention in a major US city nowhere near where I was bootstrapping at the time. Just like OP, I also convinced myself that it was absolutely necessary to attend said conference and be on the show floor with a booth when in reality in most cases it's a waste of resources better allocated elsewhere.<p>I won't claim to understand the difficulties of the immigration system, nor the intricacies of running a hardware startup in India. But I do know what's going on at CES, and it's not a massive hack to get in and have your wares displayed on the floor. As the article points out, business is often built on hustle, networking, relationships and the like. Heck, my friend socially conditioned (hustled?) his way into a badge in about 30 seconds at registration desk.<p>Yet this same hustle and networking focus means that the deals at CES are often setup months before, usually between buyers and sellers who have worked together or in the industry for years. Tough sales are worked over dinner at a strip restaurant or at that industry heavyweight party at some great club. Execs take a look at products in their hotel penthouse suite. None of this world really fits the bill for a lean startup attempting to truly validate that their product makes sense for their customers.<p>Best of luck to OP, as it seems he really wanted to focus on being at CES and overcame some obstacles when that wasn't able to take place. But I'd warn away other startups considering whether big industry expos are worth it: It kinda becomes clear once you're there that it's not.",1358585085

He's over a century after the damage was done (two, depending on when you start counting). Even <i>Citizens United</i> is but a great-grandchild of earlier 'power grabs' (see <i>Buckley v. Valeo</i>).<p>Case in point--After passing the 14th Amendment, would you care to guess at who brought the most cases to SCOTUS to have their legal rights as <i>persons</i> recognized under the Amendment? Corporations. At a ratio over 15:1. There were 19 cases that dealt with African Americans' legal rights as citizens. There were 288 cases brought by corporations asking to be recognized as persons <i>intended</i> by the language of the Amendment between 1890-1920. A 30-year program by American business to be recognized as having the rights of natural citizens using the most important Amendment in the fight against holding people as property at the cost of ~600K lives--all to pervert the national mind into holding property as people.<p>It's been a long and winding road.",1358583251

5082936,comment,5080001,5080001,2,0,eof,,,"I went to one of these with a decade of moderate meditation under my belt and just over a year of 'wanting to'.<p>I got extremely sick from a combination of rhinovirus and detox (I had been smoking regularly); and left on the 5th full day.<p>My experiences with meditation had been primarily pleasant.  I learned accidentally following rote instructions at 18; and meditated regularly on and off (mostly off as years went by) until I heard about this course (which is free, including room and board), and it took just over a year until I sorted out the opportunity to go.<p>I honestly feel/felt scared/respectful of the whole endeavor.  Meditation is what it would be like to learn to breathe underwater, if it were possible.<p>Our bodies know intrinsically we can't breathe water in; so when you are under water you don't breathe.  When oxygen levels are high its not really a thought, but even with oxygen levels are low there is an inherent <i>aversion</i> to sucking/breathing in the water.<p>Meditation is like that, in the sense our commitment to sit for ~60 minus (or 10 hours a day) is akin to committing to keep our heads under water.  The difference is with meditation, the only thing limiting how long you can sit is your will.<p>By sitting and not reacting to our thoughts we are eventually shown this ""layer"" where we are unconsciously ""holding our breath"" in the same way we do when we are under water with high levels of oxygen.  Meditation effectively ""reduces the oxygen"" thereby increasing the signal on the ""i need oxygen"" circuit, so in the same way that being under water when oxygen is running low, what was previously so subtle as to not be noticed consciously there is now this new, apparent phenomena we can't help but be made aware of.<p>This is the mechanism, in my estimation, that meditation gives its benefit.  Essentially the 'secret' learned while meditation is that ""you can breathe underwater"" and all this aversion you were feeling was a total waste of energy; energy you didn't even now you were expending.",1358583040

A lot of CS is easy for me, I think in part because the underlying thought patterns are intuitive and in part because I enjoy poking at it on my own. I don't think, say, mechanical engineering is particularly more _difficult_ on an absolute scale, but I personally would have had to work a lot harder and develop better learning skills for a mechanical engineering degree, and I would have learned a lot more in the process. And exposed my brain to something I'll likely never get a chance to expose it to now.",1358582982

It has multiple possible command lines, each implemented by a different command line shell; each shell, in turn, is almost certainly entirely capable of running on a non-Linux Unix-like OS, such as OpenBSD or Mac OS X.<p>On the other hand, <i>that's precisely the kind of thing you don't mention in a book aimed at absolute beginners.</i> It's more-or-less irrelevant to people coming from a non-command-line background who want to know how they can replicate the magic the more command line conversant can pull off.<p>Implying that bash is the only shell and that its command line is the only command line is a lie, but it's precisely the kind of lie that needs to be told to keep the early explanations simple and, more importantly, to get the student up and running with simple examples very early. The command line's main advantage is that you <i>can</i> start doing things almost instantly. Bogging down the early part of the text robs it of that immediacy.<p><i>TL;DR</i>: Don't knock this book because it doesn't mention zsh or tcsh in the first chapter. I only mention this because I've seen people do essentially similar things.<p>A lot of education is based around building a lie to use as a scaffold, and then tearing it down once the actual truth you used the scaffold to build no longer requires the lie to stand upright. The trick is knowing when to tear down the lie.",1358582968
