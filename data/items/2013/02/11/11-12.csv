As another modern take on forum software, it allows us to conceptualization modern forums from multiple perspectives.<p>2. My approach is <i>entirely</i> different than Atwoodsjust look at the screenshots(!).<p>3. All of it is open source, available for your immediate perusal and comparison at GitHub.<p>4.

5200239,comment,5197387,5197387,3,0,lucasr,,,"Firefox for Android developer here. First of all, thanks for the feedback. Just a quick reply/update on some of the points raised in the post:<p>1. We're currently working on a new iteration of the tablet UI which will replace the sidebar on portrait with a horizontal scrolling strip that goes away when you select a tab (see meta bug 817675). The sidebar will not be ""stuck"" by default anymore and will slide away once you select a tab (see bug 817728).<p>2. We mitigate things like this with anti-phishing/malware protection and the identity status icon. However, this is not guaranteed to cover every possible case. Anyway, I filed bug 839994 to get some discussion going.<p>3. I agree that the current approach is not ideal if you want to browse through your desktop/mobile bookmarks very often. The current UI is more oriented towards finding your bookmarks through the awesomescreen search. Two points about this: the UX team is working on a new design for bookmarks/reading list. It will definitely involve an overhauled UI for accessing bookmarks. In the shorter-term though, we'll be working on a new iteration of the start page that gives you quick access to your bookmarks from there (no extra taps). Work on some of these changes has already started. For instance, you can now 'pin' sites on your start page.<p>4. This is fixed in Aurora/Nightly builds (see bug 786982). You can close the last tab. You'll see the start page when you do so.<p>Hope that helps. We're an open source project. Next time, I strongly suggest you to file bugs. We're happy to clarify and re-discuss design decisions whenever necessary.",1360580807

It tests if you don't interpret the code but actually read it ""as is"".<p>Question#1 and Question#2 are less intelligent.<p>Also, no template test?

5200234,comment,5198425,5199098,1,0,simon_thepiman,,,"There is something called firefile that will save your css changes made in firebug but when I used a year or so ago it was a little buggy and stripped comments out of css (breaking WP Sites).<p>I'm working on a WordPress editor called WPide, live css/less editing is something I have planned. When your code editor is part of your website/app I think there is a lot more scope for improving the editing process.<p>With the current code on github I'm in the middle of implementing git functionality, just struggling with the push/pull side of things, ssh keys specifically.<p>I did have a concept in place for live editing of css without constant round trips to the server by passing data over cookies. This was some time back, I've since realised HTML 5 has much better ways to achieve that communication. That was when I planned to have the css editor in a different browser window but it might be easier to move the css editor panel onto the front end as a small panel like firebug/inspector. I've got code completion for PHP and WordPress so don't see why css can't be auto completed as well.<p>I kind of thought creating an editor built with PHP, HTML, javascript and css would make it easier for people to get involved and create a really good editor that was moldable by any develope but as yet no one really seems to get excited about a Web based editor and probably think I'm wasting my time but I'll plod on..",1360580667

I say ""without thinking"" because my laptop is a Mac and its VM is incredibly bad under any memory load.  The whole machine started lagging.  It took a couple of minutes to finally kill the process and get things sufficiently responsive to post this comment.<p>The same trick on my Linux box gives a NoMemoryError and doesn't eat the whole machine -- probably hit a ulimit or something.  I didn't dig into exactly what happened.  Of course, the Linux box would probably OOM-kill it right away if it had tried, so that's just fine, too.",1360580501
