5181048,story,,,3,2,beagle3,"Ask HN: Smartcards for encryption and signatures",,"An application I develop for a customer requires users to authenticate themselves in a reasonably trustworthy and secure manner. The customer requested that each user be supplied with a hardware token that can be used to encrypt and sign content created by that user. Sounds like it should be easy to do ...<p>The only standard that seems to be helpful, however, is the PGPcard (which supports RSA and DSA up to 3K bits, but not e.g. ECDSA). Which is still great - except that there is exactly one vendor that can consistently supply the hardware (kernelconcepts.de), and one awesome newcomer - YubiKey NEO, that is less than 2 months old, and is going to spend at least three out of it's initial four months being out of stock. Prices for these are in the $30-$50 range, depending on quantities and configuration.<p>Is it my inadequate market research, or is smartcard adoption and availability for these purposes really so rare?<p>Note that I'm not looking for two-factor authentication or anything of the sort; I need to be in a situation that a signed or encrypted message conclusively proves custody of a portable unique token at the time, regardless of how malicious the phone network is, how malicious an involved system administrator is, or however many hidden cameras watch the user's screen and phone while they are busy authenticating. And I would be happier to not be dependent on a single supplier.<p>Thanks!",1360223501

People know what their own eyes tell them.<p>There's an escalation path if your manager is outright forbidding you from taking 20% time, and the manager can be disciplined by the Powers That Be for that.<p>Google also doesn't always conflate project leadership with people management (it depends on the team, and the org chart is explicitly setup so that this is not a given).   There're pros and cons to both: if you're on a project where your manager is the tech lead, he'll know your work better (which can help you get promoted faster), but it also means that if you disagree with him on the technical direction of the project it can be harmful to your career.  Out of my 4-year Google career, I've spent 2.5 years on teams where my manager was directly involved in the project, and 1.5 years basically doing my own thing or on loan to other teams with minimal involvement from my manager.  I don't have a clear preference for one or the other, as I've found that my manager was always supportive of me as a person even when his primary responsibility was managing the project, and willing to let me move to another team when I'd outgrown his area of interest.<p>(It probably helped that I would work like hell to help my manager's project succeed first, and <i>then</i> transfer off once it launched.
