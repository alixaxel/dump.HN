It's not a great approach, though -- enough security disasters and the problems of migrating will simply go away, because the poor rep of the mechanism will mean no migrations are happening.<p>I'm using OAuth2 for an API, but a small subset of it that doesn't seem to permit the abuse Egor covers -- though I'm going over it with a fine-toothed comb now.  XSS vulnerabilities are more subtle than most other hacks, and so the dangers aren't as obvious in a simple review.",1361350558

5249541,comment,5247782,5247782,1,0,chinpokomon,,,"Having started my professional career as a Tester (SDET) at Microsoft, this topic resonates with me. In my experience testers need to be more aggressive and assertive with the code their developers have written. Obviously this implies you've already established a good relationship with your coworkers, but you shouldn't be afraid to tell developers that their untestable code needs to be given a second look. It's not pleasant telling someone ""their baby looks ugly,"" but that is one of the responsibilities of white box testers.<p>Dependency Injection greatly improves the landscape. Don't instantiate concrete classes when you can have a DI framework construct those objects for you. This will allow you as the tester to supply the mocked objects rather than taking the wrapper approach. It is better if as a team you've introduced this design decision up front, but you can introduce it later for problematic classes that need extra attention. In Java, I love using Guice for this sort of thing, in .NET I've used Ninject in the past.<p>One thing that .NET has in its favor that Java doesn't is partial classes with an internal access modifier. You can then put your test code in these partial classes and grant them access to your assembly. This allows you to separate your private test code hooks from your shipping code, and it prevents someone from deriving from your class and using those test interfaces incorrectly.<p>This line is the problem: public WebClient client = new WebClient(); client shouldn't be public and it shouldn't be using a concrete class. Introduce an interface, use DI, and use internal partial classes as needed. If your developer won't do this, find a new developer. Anyone can write code, but writing good testable code with a clean separation of intents is something some developers never learn, usually because no one has told them, ""You're doing it wrong.""",1361350507

5249514,comment,5247444,5247444,3,0,tripzilch,,,"I don't think HN's comment voting/sorting algorithm is up for AMA style discussions. So often a single top-level reply dominates the discussion.<p>Actually, the sorting part is probably fine. It's hard to judge, anyway.<p>But for an AMA, it's not as much the sorting, but also the interface: Check any random AMA thread on Reddit and try to imagine what it would look like without all the <i>""load more comments""</i> links. Also try to imagine how differently the discussion would flow with all threads and replies completely unfolded.<p>It's a complex and interdependent balance, that, I think, the way it is handled on HN isn't particularly suited for AMA style discussion. The most interesting questions need to float to the top. But without comment folding, the two or three most interesting questions will gather a vibrant discussion and replies, causing many people to not even get past them, and the other questions won't get sorted properly because so much less people vote on them.<p>But, why not get the best of both worlds? Get an interesting person to do an AMA on Reddit, then invite HN to come along for the discussion? For those worried about the quality of discussion, my experience is that the more ""grown up"" a topic is, the more ""grown up"" replies you will get (and childish ones voted down), so if you get someone that's big in start-up land, you'd get a good discussion just fine, unlike what you'd get with a pop-star/TV-personality.",1361349851

If you don't, this is a nice setup.  My personal experience is that I'm hyperaware of the baby in the bed even while mostly-asleep (like when changing position during the night), and in the morning have very foggy memories of turning over very carefully.<p>We generally head to bed gradually starting around 10pm (but I often read the older girl more stories downstairs while my wife gets the baby to sleep first), and the kids wake up anywhere from 8:30 to 10:30 the next morning -- usually later rather than earlier, so I get some work done in a quiet house before they get up.<p>Side-note: we got a co-sleeping bed (a crib that attaches to the side of the bed, basically) but it quickly became a toychest; the babies didn't want to be set aside.  Now we sleep sideways in the bed (headboard/footboard means no one rolls out the ""sides"") and the grown-ups put their feet in the co-sleeping attachment.<p>edit: forgot to mention that obesity is a risk factor for co-sleeping.",1361349659

Your description seems to contradict most your previous statements. You seem to be saying that the new management actually had to clean up after the old one because of all the bad decisions you claim were made. You seem to be saying that ""the former management made terrible decisions for the company and product, but at least we all had a good time"". I don't necessarily agree, but that seems to be the gist of what you are saying.<p>You are disappointed in the ""new management"" and yet your comment is about the ""old management"".<p>In fact, judging by your description, motivation at the company must have been at rock bottom even several years ago, when your previous comments would have people believe that everything was fine. Once again, I don't necessarily agree. I'm just going by your own description here.<p>> <i>The company culture was egalitarian. Decisions were not made in some ivory tower</i><p>And those decisions, you later claim, were apparently the wrong ones. How does that fit your argument?<p>> <i>Apple and Mozilla's products, at this time, struggled with the same site compatibility issues as we did in this Microsoft era.</i><p>I wouldn't say that. Mozilla had the advantage of the Netscape legacy, and Apple had the advantage of designers usually being on Macs (and despite its limited market share, Apple was loved by the press, giving the company far more influence than its market position would otherwise indicate).<p>> <i>Not to mention the failed projects we poured resources into, draining all departments for the people they needed just to _catch_up_ to the competition.</i><p>Weren't these projects started by the old management, in the old egalitarian company culture you claim existed but is now gone?<p>> <i>Suddenly, without warning, the guy next to you - who had been there for a decade - would be leaving.</i><p>But wasn't that his own decision? Wasn't that guy given the chance to choose himself whether to leave or not? Whether he felt he could live with the technology switch?<p>See, I have another problem with your criticism of the new management and praise of the old management. You mentioned the 2010 layoffs, and you seem to be saying that it was better to come up with what you claim was a bullshit excuse (economic downturn) to justify it? Once again I must stress that I am not saying that you are right or wrong as that is not my point. I'm questioning the consistency of your claims.<p>I think most people would agree that it's better to say nothing than to tell a lie. You seems to be accusing the old management of telling lies during the downsizing in 2010.<p>At least now we have made a major acquisition, which the management obviously could not discuss when the downsizing actually took place. It seems logical that one wishes to save money when buying something expensive, and try to avoid too large of a loan.<p>> <i>When things got difficult, one would blame Microsoft, as if taking the moral high ground would make any difference.</i><p>Isn't this the old management again? And have you not just been arguing that taking the moral high ground is <i>good</i>? That morals are more important than doing what's right for the business? The egalitarian company which makes all the wrong decisions but everyone is having fun is better than the top management making a technology decision that some in the company may not agree with (or God forbid, passionate former employees do not agree with)?<p>> <i>We should have thrown out that ugly ad-banner instantly. Dropped the old paid model the moment Phoenix came into existence.</i><p>You may not recall the round of layoffs back then. A company can't support further development without any revenue, after all. You can't just drop one of your main sources of revenue without knowing that you can replace it. And even when we did remove the ads, it was not certain that it would work. It probably would, but it was not a certainty.<p>> <i>I spent seven years of my life on this project. Now it's gone.</i><p>Yes, I'm sure it's frustrating to see someting you've worked hard on for years disappear, but that doesn't mean it's the wrong decision.<p>Opera as you knew it is gone, you say. But the Opera you knew doesn't sound all that great if we are to judge by your passionate description of the state of affairs at the time.<p>All those decisions that you say were so terrible... they were made under the old ""good management"", in the culture you have just praised. It seems to me you can't have it both ways. You can't have engineers make all the decisions, and then first complain that this power was taken away from them, and later complain that the decision that were made under the system you praised were bad ones.<p>You want a technology-driven company where everyone gets to make or influence decisions, but you also claim that this led to major problems.<p>See, I can't get it to make any sense.

Both RAM and storage were limited, and the machine had a clock speed of 1 mHz (glacially slow by modern standards).<p>Also (apart from a version of BASIC that was too slow for serious work), there were no high-level languages, so if you wanted to write a high performance program, you needed to write in assembly language -- one step above object code.<p>I wrote Apple Writer in assembly language -- a very slow and laborious process, but the resulting program was very fast - much faster than its competition. This was one reason for its success.<p>> And how did it end up being used in Apple's O/S?<p>It was actually sold alongside Apple's operating system, it wasn't integrated into it. What happened was that the Apple decision-makers, Steve Jobs in particular, realized they had already saturated the market for hobbyists, and wanted to begin to sell computers to ordinary people, people who intended to use a computer to solve everyday problems like writing and printing documents.<p>Somehow they heard about a word processor I was writing for my own use, and asked to see it. So, riding my bicycle to the post office with a big manila envelope, I thought, ""Hey, maybe they'll like my program. I might make hundreds of dollars."" As it turned out, over the next five years I made over six million dollars in royalties.<p>More details: <a href=""http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/cottage_computer_programming.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/cottage_computer_programmi...</a>",1361347398
