For functions that return values I need to use, I will be warned by the compiler if I forget to handle the error.  For those that don't, the compiler will happily let me accidentally ignore the error.<p>I'd rather require that all return values be handled whether I use them or not.  For the rare case that a function returns a value I honestly don't care about, I can just use _.  At least I'm not hiding the fact that I knowingly am ignoring stuff.<p>(Edit: despite the above, I still do enjoy using Go.)",1360475946

The peak in recent history appears to have been around 2000 at 67.3%. Currently, it's at 63.6%.<p>The furthest back I could find is 1948 for 58.6 at the start of that year. Last time we were in the 63% range was in 1980s. Guessing from 19th century, it has gone up.<p>Source: <a href=""http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet</a><p>The key here is to understand what influences this rate. Many factors go into what percentage of population chooses to seek employment. For example, if my wife and I are rich enough, when we have kids, we may want to have one or even both of us take a few years off to raise them. This is a profound luxury in the current US society. Some countries have extended maternity leave that lasts for 3 years and includes some form of pay or other welfare payment. Such structures would easily drive the participation rate down.<p>Conversely, public daycares and other child-friendly services promote higher participation rates by freeing both adults to work.<p>These examples are meant to show that the ""machines are taking our jobs"" discussion to be a gross oversimplification of a much more complex system. So far, history tells us that we will adapt. That still leaves a possibility of a black swan event... In either case, I have faith in humanity :-)",1360475211

There are publishing networks big (Medium) and small (see all the Markdown+Dropbox blog platforms) that are gunning for WordPress and Tumblr right now, which suggests that we're going to find new ways to encourage movement on the medium-form writing style.<p>And here's the other thing: While blogs are more likely to influence a purchase than Facebook, any good marketer has presence on Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter <i>and</i> blogs.

We have fought a half dozen of bugs -- the week I was implementing it our first app I had seven tickets open in their support system -- with admin screens that time out or don't work, APIs that time out, etc. Everything from the APIs to the admin just feels a bit unfinished and amateurish.<p>Support has been very lacking. At one point I had waited a long time (a week?) for a ticket response while they said they would investigate, and suddenly they just closed the ticket with no explanation. I felt like I had to fight to get any attention.<p>That said, its delivery seems reliable.<p>We have since switched to Mailgun for a lot of stuff, and will be migrating the rest soon. Mailgun has been rock solid from the start, the admin screens are fast, the APIs just make sense, and they were really responsive when we asked about a missing feature. Unlike SendGrid where the delivery log took ages to show results, Mailgun's equivalent page is really snappy.
