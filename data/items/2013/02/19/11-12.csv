There was no MVC framework, it was  a hacked together mess.<p>Somehow the live site started using the staging database instead of the production database, both were on the same server.\nEvery time we (the devs) pushed to staging a script would grab the latest version of the live database and overwrite (drop tables) the staging database. The assumption being that the staging database is a bit like a demo server, changes made to it are temporary and just for testing, but that it should look as similar to the main website (but updated) as possible.\nThe production database was backed up in about 5 different ways, but the staging database wasn't backed up at all.<p>After about a week of vanishing books, books which authors had uploaded to the self publishing portable with descriptions and other information, we realised what was wrong. Their files stayed but their accounts and book details were wiped.<p>In another epic fail on the same server I later moved the root folders by running the following as root (I'd probably have been stupid and run the same command if not as root but I'd have put sudo in front of it).\n> cd /home/<username>/public_html/public_html\n> mv /* ../<p>I was meant to mv ./* (files from the current directory into one below cause they'd been copied across into the wrong folder.

And even though there are enough good developers able to do this, the mother of all problems when developing software is managing <i>complexity</i>.<p>Yes, you can take a subroutine and apply local optimizations on it. Building complex software in assembly that on the whole is better optimized than what a compiler can do is next to impossible.<p>Speaking of SIMD and stuff like it, there are already optimizations that LLVM is doing, but such optimizations are hard to apply ahead of time because (1) if you want to distribute those binaries easily, then you need to compile for the common denominator (which is less of an issue with LLVM) and (2) your programming language sucks. It's not the compiler's fault, but rather your own fault that you're using a programming language so confusing that inferring <i>intent</i> from your code is next to impossible. How can the compiler know that you're sorting freaking numbers if you're specifying exactly how bits move around in memory while doing so?<p>If you're speaking about virtual machines though, there are projects out there for .NET or Scala for instance that can recompile/retarget code at runtime to run with SIMD instructions or on your GPUs if you have any. All you need is a virtual machine that runs bytecode and a programming language (slash compiler) that lets you access at runtime the syntax trees of the routines that you want to optimize and that lets you generate new bytecode. So you can easily shove this kind of optimizations in libraries for special-purpose and descriptive DSLs (e.g. LINQ).<p>Of course, it gets tricky and doing stuff like this at runtime has overhead, but it's better than what 99.99% of developers can do, not to mention that good developers first and foremost <i>ship</i>.",1361272600

They keyboard was phenomenal compared to cheap asus books I've tried (both feel and horrible layout were a cause).<p>Then I got Dell (E6400) and liked the keyboard even more. The feel was better.
