You'd hope that the people doing it would know how installs work.<p>But the default place where chocolatey installs is ""C:\chocolatey"", and ""C:\" is where people who don't understand windows file system layout put things.<p>The docs ( <a href=""https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/DefaultChocolateyInstallReasoning"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/DefaultChocola...</a> ) make a plausible case that this <i>option</i> might be justified <i>sometimes</i>. Saying ""we'll <i>always</i> put it somewhere nonstandard because some people might sometimes want to install it when they don't have permissions to put programs where they belong"" is unconvincing.<p>The other argument put forward ""It's not installed through the registry"" (so?) and ""it's a Special core component tool"" (it's not special to anyone who hasn't installed it yet) are equally weak.<p>This choice of install folder should arguably  be allowed. But it's a rubbish default, a poor first impression and undermines confidence that they know what they're doing. It is inexcusable that ""C:\Chocolatey"" is default and ""C:\Program Files\Chocolatey"" is a set-up that one does manually.",1360144681
5175664,comment,5175190,5175361,4,0,igravious,,,"Not to be glib. But it is _meant_ to replace both presumably. Now hear me out cuz I am no Microsoft fanboy, I haven't used Windows in years but I have to credit Microsoft for innovating. We always heap praise on Apple for the iPad, iPhone, and Macbook Air so I think we should praise Microsoft when they innovate too. Ok, fair enough, ne must innovate and hit the mark, have Microsoft hit the mark?<p>Because it has touch and is the size of a tablet (like an iPad) and the power and form-factor of an ultra-book (like a Macbook Air) it seems obvious to me that it meant to replace both devices with one device. Why is this hard for folks to see? Now, is it a drop-in replacement? The battery (as Anand says) lets it down, so the answer is negative in this respect but you are saving on the cost of having to buy an iPad and a Macbook Air so the answer is positive in that respect. Comes with a pen for precision drawing input, positive. Runs Windows, negative (joke! ok, you can see the Linux guy coming out in me). Um, so on balance I'd have to say, intriguing device - has its plusses and minuses. If they up the battery life significantly with Surface Pro 2 and shrink it some more they are on to a definite winner and game changer. It'll _never_ be as portable as an iPad (because it has the guts of an ultrabook) so we need to get that out of our heads, all Microsoft needs to do is make it svelte _enough_.<p>That's my take on the whole thing. Now back to me Gentoo server ...",1360144679

You can differentiate a bit by using a template (which is just another node in the tree). For example you can view the discussion in 1D if you want.. but there's really no point.<p>Example: HN in that setting would be just one node, called Hacker News. Each submission would be a post/comment and all the comments from here would be just subcomments under that parent post. If someone posted here about new language for example, that post along with all discussion under it can be become a new ""forum"". If you move it away from under HN, you can still leave a hardlink there so it won't be lost.<p>Is the discussion there civilized though? Mostly not.",1360144373
5175659,comment,5165819,5175549,1,0,philwelch,,,"Thanks for asking. No, this doesn't quite answer my points.<p>You made more or less the deflection that I was expecting--that the issue isn't just sexual harassment, but rather that society, in aggregate, empowers men at the expense of women. But see, even there you are committing a fallacy of division, because it doesn't follow that the status quo on every individual issue empowers men at the expense of women. So you can't pull in that overarching narrative of heroic feminists vs. evil misogynists that easily.<p>The other rhetorical trick feminists use to bully people into not disagreeing so loudly is one you've pulled here--the notion that disagreeing with feminism is equivalent to misogyny. From my perspective, all you're doing is making a fallacious argument that the misogynist power structure has made sexual harassment acceptable in our society, waiting for people to say ""no it hasn't"", and then turning around and saying ""yes it has--just by disagreeing with my argument you are part of the misogynist power structure."" This argument isn't in good faith. It's isomorphic to what I call the Ayn Rand fallacy. Ayn Rand's fallacy was: all my beliefs are governed by a philosophical system built on reason, therefore if you disagree with me you are irrational. In Ayn Rand's inner circle, wearing beards or enjoying Mozart were considered irrational because they conflicted with Ayn Rand's tastes. You are making an isomorphic argument: my beliefs are governed by a philosophical system predicated on not hating women, therefore if you disagree with me you hate women. In making this argument, feminists don't reveal their interlocutors as misogynists; they reveal themselves as Ayn Rand--arrogant ideologues with no consideration for the possibility they might be fundamentally mistaken.<p>Furthermore, you also haven't sufficiently demonstrated your premise that society, in aggregate, empowers men at the expense of women. You say it's ""really easy to observe"", and it may be through your lens. Through mine, it's clear that in some things, men are indeed empowered at the expense of women, while in other things, women are empowered at the expense of men. I wouldn't be confident in any aggregation of either side's various privileges and oppressions. Neither of us has a perfectly clean lens to start with, and it isn't helpful to exclusively look through the biased lens of a tendentious ideology, either.<p>Fundamentally, any such aggregation wouldn't be of much use anyway because individual issues should be addressed one at a time, empirically, not through some overarching ideological narrative. It's funny that you mention Marxism, because you seem to share with them the same central error: you have not yet outgrown the naive notion that one overarching philosophical system can solve all problems. Life is more than just some manichean narrative where you can cast yourself on the side of the heroes. It is more complicated than that.<p>(P.S. If you're interested in continuing this, <i>please</i> feel free to email me. This thread is rapidly growing stale, but this discussion has already helped me to clarify a lot of thoughts I've been having recently, so I do appreciate and value it.)",1360144354

I <i>got to my current ideological position</i> by questioning things when the evidence of my senses persistently failed to match up with what 'the majority' or 'received wisdom' said. So yes, I have questioned this stuff - it would have made my life much easier were it not true.<p>Next, 'Sexual harassment' isn't a side, nor is it an agent. The 'sides' are 'the sexists' vs 'the non-sexists', or if you want a more 'fighting words' formulation, 'the misogynists' vs 'the decent human beings' (with, in both cases, 'the neutrals' and 'the not-actually-involved's' as well).<p>The structural power imbalance is really really easy to observe. Look at the reactions to posts like the OP's, both here on HN and in terms of the comments (if their blog has comments enabled) or email they receive.<p>(As an aside, for this kind of thing Ashe Dryden's blog posts (for example) are better than the OP's at cataloguing responses and providing links.)<p>There are replies after incident reports like this kind of thing saying that the woman deserved it, or ""can't you guys take a joke"", or that it doesn't actually happen, or ""it doesn't count as sexism, the real sexism is that sexist acts get called sexism"" etc etc etc. The people who respond that way seem to honestly feel like they are in the majority - and, as incident reports seem to indicate, many conference organisers act like they agree with that assessment. If there is a mechanism that protects people who perform sexist actions, and protects the protectors, and so on, and no counterbalancing mechanism, then that there is evidence of a structural imbalance.<p>As for ""it happening more than other socially unacceptable behaviour"" - we actually have papers that measure the effects of this kind of thing, and their conclusions were uniformly that sexism and misogyny were serious problems with large negative effects in computer science and programming fields. The problem with racism is probably comparable, but fortunately many of the things that have proven effective at reducing sexism related problems also reduce racism related problems, and the two things do not work at cross purposes, so it isn't an either-or problem. The problem with magical thinking and a lack of education <i>might</i> be comparable, but efforts to fix general rationality deficits are often hampered by having entrenched specific rationality deficits, and basic exercises in testing reality and accepting conclusions if pointed at dissolving the various edifices that protect racism and sexism in the industry would advance both causes, so this also isn't an either-or. If you were a marxist or anarchist I could see you thinking that the wage-labour situation was more pressing than any of the above, but again modern marxist and anarchist thought seems to be going in the direction that microfascisms that are allowed to fester will result in macrofascism, plus the whole ideas of perpetual revolution and solidarity, so dealing with racism and sexism are pretty important in order for the revolution to actually be able to win at all.<p>Does this answer your points?",1360141353
