As long as you stay away from ""hot"" topics such as direct criticism of the ruling party and sensitive issues such as immigration, you are ok. But if you make too many waves, there are many ways in which such selective enforcement can come back to bite you.<p>On an individual level, you will get much more attention on things like your tax returns. Your Provident Fund usage can be limited in many ways(It is a opaque system and they don't need to give you any justifications)<p>If you own a company, it will also be subject to a much higher tax scrutiny. They can choke your company by limiting the number of foreign talent that you can hire( again an opaque process). They can reject your applications without any reasons and simply say better luck next year.<p>Even with all these pressures, Singapore is a great place to do business and just enjoy a generally high quality of life as long as you don't do anything foolhardy or get really unlucky with the cards that you get dealt.<p>On a side note, if the person in question above was involved in some tricky business, then I would not put it past this government to take drastic measures",1361019559

I used to work on data analysis at a healthcare startup. There is no shortage of driven, talented, intelligent people making businesses in that space. There are giant firehoses of money in healthcare as well, both effective uses and of the boondoggle variety.<p>So it's not solely the lure of money that draws bright people out of healthcare. It could also be the realization that nothing you ever did would be more effective than getting doctors to wash their hands, and doctors <i>still</i> don't do that.<p>Many people are brilliant enough to make wonderful tools, but it seems that nobody is brilliant enough to overcome a system that doesn't want to use them.

Overall, I've been very happy with it.<p>What I liked:<p>- Relative simplicity and very little code for most common tasks (showing/hiding content, AJAX and JSON support, breaking down the UI into components / areas).<p>- Great testability, thanks to relatively clean separation of concerns.<p>- The two way databinding support is awesome and works well. This does away with lots of the usual boilerplate.<p>- Templating is very straightforward.<p>- No performance issues to report. But from what I can gather, Angular a bit like the Swing framework - it's possible to shoot yourself in the foot and write poorly peforming applications. (Haven't managed to do that yet ;))<p>What I'm struggling with:<p>- Working with directives is complicated. They are the only way you can integrate with other javascript components sanely. Specifically, I ran into some issues with how to make the databinding work between directives. Still wrapping my head around how that bit works.<p>- It took a while before I was able to get my unit tests up and running (most example test suites were out of date with the current way of doing things)<p>- I have some (minor) issues with how things are named. There are two kinds of 'Controllers', for example, which are used in very different contexts (in the DOM, and in directives). Angular's 'controllers' are actually closer to models IMHO (they are where you manipulate state) than controllers.",1361018115

For startups and small businesses, as long as you do not have outside professional investors (like VC's) always use LLC's. The solution to the problem described by Chris is simple: do your accounting on a cash and not an accrual basis. That way the only way you will ever pay taxes is if you have the cash. LLC's are designed to: 1) avoid double taxation (at the personal and corporate levels) and 2) allow you to pass losses through so that you can reduce your personal tax liability. As was noted there are many very large brands that use LLC's for certain products too such as Amazon, NFL, A&E Television and probably thousands more.

They argue that Shane Todd had been anxious and feared for his life for some time before his death. Had that been the case, and Shane Todd was unable to leave Singapore due to his situation, surely the US gov should've been informed of the situation and help transfer Shane back to the US. The US gov would also have had an interest in doing so since Shane Todd had reported to his mother that he was possibly compromising the security of his home land due to his research in Singapore.<p>Quote2 [He said he felt he was being asked to compromise American security.]<p>Quote1 indicates Shane means to dedicate his life to 'God'(phrased Father) if he survives.

- Backbone I learnt straight away and have been progressively writing better code for around a year. It gives you enough rope to hang yourself but you can usually see what you've done and refactor. Which is nice.
- Ember I've been trying to learn a couple of times for the past year. Keep trying. Find a tutorial. It's out of date. Get frustrated. Try again. Find another one. It's poorly written. Try Again. Find another one. Can't get something to work and Ember is too much of a blackbox to debug. Give up.<p>The docs on the site are getting better (but still suck) - the PeepCode tutorial was great (<i>not</i> the Play By Play with Yehuda; don't waste your money on that) - but it still only did relatively trivial things. Would be great if PeepCode did a Play By Play with a Rails API and relational data etc.<p>- Angular scared me for ages too - the docs, as with Ember, are written by people who know how to use the framework <i>for</i> people who know how to use it already.

Email - barely half-baked feature and my biggest problem with Posterous, as initially it was their most hyped core feature (and I believed them). Spaces it's just ol' plain Posterous, they enhanced the name for some vague reasons. Groups is nothing special. Slideshows - another lightbox variant. Sharing to multiple social networks - buggy. The list goes on? So bring it.<p>Meanwhile, I'll bring my own. Posterous was moderately responsive at most, but e-mail responsiveness and fixing/improving the site and its functionality are different things. Even CEO may be responding to my mails, but it means nothing if it doesn't change a bit of the outcome. I guess the problem was that they had their own vision and roadmap paved with features that will have the biggest impact. They were simply unwilling to pay attention to anything else. It would be fine, really, if they stated it clearly from the beginning.<p>1. Initially Suyash responded to my first mail (appraisal; asking for markdown inline images, feedburner mybrand and introduction of commenting system such as intense debate). It looked like:<p>""Thanks for your wonderful email and detailed feedback. I'll pass on some of your suggestions to the team.""<p>2. Second thread (Identi.ca autopost and unwanted location disclosure) didn't get any response.<p>3. Third thread (wrong URL of the post being previously private and with the title changed before becoming publicized, i.e. premature public URL generation)<p>""We'll look into changing this behavior in a future update.""<p>4. Fourth thread (<!--more--> doesn't work with markdown, editor doesn't switch to markdown mode immediately, even though the post was written in markdown, no setting for making markdown the default mail posting style) didn't get any response.<p>5. In my mail starting the fifth thread (1 month later) I collected existing problems. Response, this time from Rick:<p>re commenting system - ""Very few have asked for this, so it is unlikely that we will implement without a lot more support.""<p>re url prematurely created - ""I'm not sure I understand your question.""<p>re edit in markdown mode immediately - ""this is in our queue""<p>re <!--more--> equivalent in markdown - ""I will check on status of this to make sure it is added the next time we update this feature""<p>re automarkdown mail - ""this is in our queue""<p>re markdown inline images - ""this is in our queue""<p>My response got no response, so 3 weeks later I asked about any progress.<p>""Unfortunately, no meaningful progress - these are on our list, but not yet high enough on the priority queue for us to work on yet.""<p>I ask again 2.5 months later.<p>""Your requests are still on our feature list, but not many people have requested them so they are not prioritized very highly.  We're a small team with a lot still to add and are trying to focus on the features that will have the biggest impact.""<p>Finally I was so frustrated that I suggested working myself on some of bugs/lacking features (free of charge, maybe t-shirt or something) as they are mostly easy to implement. I wrote also that it's sad that identi.ca problem was not solved.<p>""Thanks so much for your offer to help - to clarify, we did look at the identica problem and it's on our list too.   Unfortunately, we can't easily open up our code to outside developers right now.""<p>I mailed them no more, as you know, it was pointless.<p>For some time there was a forum available, when people reported their problems, bugs, etc. It was all the same - ""it's in our queue, but not high enough.""<p>---<p>Conclusions<p>Be honest - if you don't want to fix reported problems and hear about even simple enhancements, as you won't implement them how trivial they are (because it doesn't fit into your vision or whatever, I don't know), just say it clearly in public (on the page) or at least private (in the first response, I wouldn't bother you anymore).<p>The tragedy of the present times is mediocrity in everything, but software and web services in particular.
