5155390,comment,5154956,5155299,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"I'm not sure how that addresses the issue of too much judicial latitude on the top end. Giving judges discretion to reduce a sentence makes good sense. Giving them discretion to go up (or equivalently to go anywhere which is ""down"" from the stars) is abdicating the duty of Congress and inviting injustice, and the uncertainty provides undue leverage to prosecutors in plea negotiations, especially for an accused with little experience with the justice system. And the uncertainty isn't just in the judge's adherence to the guidelines, it's in what goes into the calculation. The guidelines are obviously very complicated (""43 offense levels"" etc.) and you don't get to present your case to a jury and learn their findings of fact before deciding to take a plea, so whenever there is a fact in dispute that causes an order of magnitude difference in the guideline sentence, the guidelines force the accused to take an unduly large risk in going to trial.<p>Moreover, the sentencing guidelines are still full of harsh penalties. When Congress presents the authors of the guidelines with a maximum penalty of 25 years, it makes a five year prison term seem generous to the accused, notwithstanding that it is in actual fact an extremely harsh prison sentence in absolute terms.<p>And, correct me if I'm wrong, whether something is a felony is based on the maximum penalty rather than the imposed penalty. So even if your actual sentence is ""only"" a number of months under the sentencing guidelines and in practice, you're still a felon for the rest of your life with all of the disqualifications that come with it if the <i>maximum</i> penalty exceeded a year.<p>I don't think it's too much to ask for Congress to better differentiate between more and less serious crimes and to set appropriate maximum penalties for each.",1359786996

I am more thinking about the brain space wasted with deceptive marketing claims, the money extracted from people, not to mention schools, and the horrible waste of people investing in learning about the MS ecosystem and the proliferating it. Microsoft learned to eat chalk, and the hard and scary way it learned to open up a little, but Mr. Bill Gates was once perfectly looking forward to the internet being a flop and everybody using MSN, to name just one of dozens examples clearly mapping the ugly underbelly. And far from silentely trying to improve the world without caring about the credit too much, MS was always keen on talking about stuff they didn't come up with as if they did, without technically lying.<p>Microsoft isn't special in that regard, sure, but to me even the best achievements are seen on the background of corporate armbandism and become morally worthless at best.<p>I am perfectly fine with someone who owes their life to the Gates foundation loving the guy, and happy for every life saved. But when it comes to <i>me</i> thinking Bill Gates is ""cool"", it just doesn't work out that way. So when someone else implies I kinda have to agree that this is all super awesome, I resist. Yes it is, but it doesn't make up for the other stuff, not one iota. Apologizing for all the lies and FUD about Linux, now that would be something... because hey, if people save money that way, they can buy healthy food, or go to a doctor of their choosing, and that's good thing, right? <i>right?</i><p>Why is it always that we first allow a bunch of clowns to run just about everything, and then are grateful for the breadcrumbs they let trickle down? I am sure there are many people in China singing the praises of some party members who helped them get surgery or whatever. Yes, and? Take a step back, see the individual parts and how they fit together. Suddenly it's much less impressive, and the real heroes turn out to be the ones giving their lives to help others who DID NOT first sell a bunch of drugs or whatever to get the means to do so.",1359785859

Some are just dead enders from past times, some stem from American individualism and it's ideology, and a lot from failures to invest in infrastructure and our human resources (our citizens).<p>Of course health care is an incredibly contentious topic but I was struck by the sheer waste and cruelty of the system when I read of the story of a 24 year old man that died because of a tooth infection.<p>He went to the pharmacy with two prescriptions, an antibiotic and a pain killer.<p>Lacking the money for the higher priced antibiotics he only filled the pain killer prescription. He died from that infection.<p>Society spent at least $7000 per year for 12 years to educate this young man and we let him die for lack of $70 for a prescription. Even if you feel no empathy and discount  national shame this is an example of breath taking irrational economic waste.",1359785425

The edge one is more up to date (not just because its edge- the 3.x one needs love). Are you subscribed to the Rails security mailing list and core list?<p>There is plenty to security that is not in the Rails documentation, though, and it is by no means bulletproof by any stretch of the imagination. If you don't take security seriously, then you increase the chance of getting stung. From exploits that you have to watch out for in your code, to setting up the server(s) and infrastructure in the most secure way that makes sense, it is a lot of work.",1359784851
5155342,comment,5154956,5155199,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"We've had this discussion before. The maximum sentence available under law is not a good guide to the maximum likely sentence. Think about the fact that murder can get the death penalty of life in prison with no parole, but the mean sentence is about 20 years and the median about 24 (from which you can infer that quite a few people get short sentences in the 6-10 year bracket).<p>you can't talk about the disproportionality of the sentence because none has been handed down yet. It's meaningless to talk about the disproportionality of the maximum sentence when the law is designed to accommodate offences from the trivial to the truly egregious.<p>You think this allows too much discretion to prosecutors and courts, OK, so did a lot of other people at one point, and that's how we wound up with standardized sentencing guidelines and mandatory minimums. Typical sentence lengths went up, because the sentencing guidelines are so exhaustive that prosecutors pile on obscure enhancements. Mandatory minimums were recently found to be unconstitutional, in <i>US v. Booker</i>. Federal sentencing guidelines were put in place in 1984. It's not a coincidence that the US incarceration rate took off for the stratosphere around the same time. Sentencing was more lenient, albeit less consistent, when it was left to the discretion of the courts.<p>You don't lose any of your constitutional rights when you accept a plea bargain. The reality is that people take them because they don't expect to win in court. The standard of proof in criminal trials is very high, so defense lawyers have little incentive to accept a plea bargain unless the evidence overwhelmingly points to guilt.",1359784816
