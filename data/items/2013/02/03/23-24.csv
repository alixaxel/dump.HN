It's an item from a bullet-point list of contemplative exercises found in traditional Stoicism and other Socratic philosophies.  The meditation on death (melete thanatou) was mentioned by Socrates as an integral part of his approach to philosophy, according to Plato and it's common to many other philosophical and spiritual traditions, even Eastern approaches such as Buddhism.  You'd need to read the literature to understand the concept of the exercise, although that doesn't necessarily mean you'd agree with it you won't get a reasonable idea of what it's about just from that one sentence description, and that's not what it's meant for anyway.

Vendor B writes something that's mostly to spec, but accidentally doesn't properly quote things. It works fine, because A is liberal and infers these quotes.<p>Vendor C comes along and builds exactly to spec. But despite being perfectly to spec, it doesn't interop because B sends invalid data! But B is a big vendor, and their stuff works with A.<p>So now C must add a hack to their parser to deal with the fact that, because A was liberal, B got their implementation wrong.<p>One example is the loose routing parameter, ""lr"". It has no value, you just add the name of the parameter ""uri;lr"" in contrast to other parameters like ""tag=bla"". Some implementations send ""lr=on"", and that should be mostly harmless. Except other implementations take that to mean ""lr"" has a value, and no longer accept just ""lr"" as turning the feature on.<p>SIP is full of these things, many of them in the <i>parsing</i> layer alone, let alone actual semantics of what things mean.

When Thatcher took over in Britain, a big, sclerotic, hugely inefficient state was <i>fait accompli</i>.

In Denmark, the political debate, even on the most nutty right-wing fringe, is limited to discussing limiting the rate of growth.

Buying Amazon stock at these valuations is a bet that in the future they will eventually decide to turn some valves to begin diverting floods of profit into their pockets (i.e., your pocket, as a shareholder), or that the stock price itself will be higher in the future for other reasons (i.e., speculation). The big question is whether the mix of ""fields they enter"" can support profit margins in the future that will be sufficiently large to justify your investment at current prices (low-margin retail vs. cloud services, for example).<p>Apple, on the other hand, already has those valves wide open, and is gobbling up historic amounts of cash. The mix of fields Apple has entered is well understood; notably, the market wants Apple to define, enter, and dominate new fields, and Apple's opacity in this regard leads to much gnashing of teeth and rending of garments. At the same time, would the market also prefer that Apple close those valves a bit (make less money to buy marketshare and customers)?

Reflecting on death, he mentions if you lived thousand lives, it would be just be the same stuff over and over again.  How true.",1359934649

Given this template:<p><pre><code>    <bar.hpp>\n    template <typename foo>\n    foo bar(foo x) { return foo; }\n</code></pre>\na compiler is asked to compile:<p><pre><code>    #include <bar.hpp> //source code is parsed and intermediate representation generated by the compiler\n\n    int x = bar(some_int); //performs template expansion on said object code\n    float y = bar(some_y); //performs template expansion on said object code\n    //bar.hpp's source is examined only once!\n</code></pre>\nThis is why you can't do some things in templates that you can do with say, C macros (and vice-versa).",1359934553

A C++ interpreter (<a href=""http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cint"" rel=""nofollow"">http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cint</a>) for example, doesn't process the includes any more than most of these others. Most modern C++ compilers of course have to parse the file, but do not actually compile code unless it is used. The more sophisticated ones can usually cleverly avoid even parsing a file a second time.<p>Technically most of those languages some degree of processing of those import/includes. Much to my chagrin Python actually evaluates the entire file, as does Perl, Ruby, PHP & JavaScript. Java, Haskell and C# (and I guess now VB) do their static type checking (often very efficiently because the type information is cached or at least already byte compiled), and Lua does a fair bit of processing as well. Smalltalk is image based, so it's kind of a very different context, but it probably could make the best  case for ""not having to process every time a module is imported/included"", because code is loaded in to a global symbol table once, and most implementations wait until message dispatch to resolve things further.<p>In general, I'd say the nature of your concern is more about long compile times, and C++ definitely is ""impressive"" in that regard. Some of that problem lies within the language's idiosyncrasies (sticking with the legacy C linker being a big one), but a lot of it is simply that it tries to resolve so much at compile time rather than run time. While not always desirable, I think there is definitely a place for tool like that.",1359933014

I suppose you could counter that such a metric of success would depend greatly on the time period you looked at. Still, I think it might be reasonable to assert that a god who let all his followers die out is less likely to exist than a god who has inspired his followers to successfully spread his name to every country on earth for two thousand years running.

This is far from an ""utter failure"". In 2013 you'd be hard pressed to find someone who has disabled JavaScript or is using a browser that doesn't support it. Furthermore, its safe to assume that a user who has purposely disabled JavaScript is sufficiently technical enough to know why they did it and re-enable it if they really want to use the site.<p>Calling this an utter failure is total hyperbole. Okay, so the site doesn't gracefully degrade. That's a failure for best practices. But best practice isn't always so black and white and a site that doesn't degrade gracefully isn't always absolutely an utter failure. Consider the target audience of this. It'll be more technically inclined people. It's again safe to assume these people will mostly have JS enabled and most people won't have a problem.
