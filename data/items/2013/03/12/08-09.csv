That does not mean they're sharing the wealth.<p>Of course it does. What would be the point of having $1000 if you can buy nothing for it? And if everything costed $0.0001, wouldn't somebody with $1000 be rich? Wealth is how much stuff you can buy (stuff meaning not only physical goods, of course, but other things you want too). If you can buy more stuff - you're more wealthy. If things got cheaper - you become more wealthy even if amount of money didn't change.<p>>>>> Anyone on minimum wage can theoretically do that.<p>Practically, they'd just get an Obamaphone ""for free"" (paid by taxpayers, of course), but that's besides the point.<p>>>>> but I would hardly define that as sharing the wealth.<p>That's because what you mean doesn't seem to be sharing the wealth, it seems to be envy. If you get a lot, but the neighbor gets more, you're envious - why he has more and you don't? Probably because he's not sharing! If you stop looking at Joneses and look at each person as he/she is, you'd see the wealth is being constantly shared.<p>>>>> I would define sharing the wealth as not having to declare bankruptcy when your kid has cancer.<p>This has nothing to do with sharing the wealth. This has everything to do with parents not having adequate insurance. That's what insurance <i>is</i> for.<p>>>>> I don't see how adding a $300 TV or air conditioning to this mix would make one feel like they're sharing the wealth.<p>What you mean by ""sharing the wealth"" is ""I don't want anything bad happen to me and don't want to ever have money trouble or suffer consequences of either my poor foresight or unexpected circumstances, because there are people around who don't"". Sorry, this has nothing to do with sharing the wealth, and the bad news are - nothing can do that for you. Shit happens, and nobody can be fully guaranteed from it. You can, however, be reasonably prepared and reasonably cautious - such as not buying a house on the peak of the bubble, but renting for 3-4 years and then buying when the bubble pops and Joneses have to sell because they can make barely 50% in rent. For each one of those there's one of those who rents for 50% of the mortgage. That's who you want to be, not the other guy :)",1363078660

Various federal and local rules have stipulated that (in certain cases like these) the Plaintiff must be represented by independent counsel. It appears to some that the entities that they have set up are actually under the control of Prenda Law, and thus violates the independent counsel rules. This may constitute a fraud that was perpetrated on the court, which would be very bad for Prenda Law.<p>Quick legal disclaimer: The above paragraphs are a statement of my opinion that I've drawn based on reading the Ars Technica series, the Popehat series, and the various court filings in the case (12-cv-08333). This disclaimer is probably not necessary but Prenda law has filed several defamation suits that include anonymous John Does commenting on the case(s): <a href=""http://phillylawblog.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/prenda-law-john-steele-and-paul-duffy-file-suit-against-alan-cooper-his-lawyer-paul-goodfread-and-anonymous-john-does"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phillylawblog.wordpress.com/2013/03/03/prenda-law-joh...</a>",1363076628
