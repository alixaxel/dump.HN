He said he was unable to turn around while near the ""invisible wall,"" and had to walk backwards to get away from it.<p>Also, he described the whole plant having serious ESD hazards:  tape on floor to mark pathways, and if you left the path, you might get zapped by a mini-lightning from some ungrounded machine.",1363935557

5421722,comment,5419071,5419071,6,0,Shenglong,,,"Respectably, I disagree with the OP on this entire subject. Yes, the Adria scandal was not constructive to any party involved - but the way it's being analyzed is dead wrong:<p><i>When women in this industry are hurt, were all hurt.</i><p>No. No. It's <i>exactly</i> this kind of thinking that got us here in the first place. It's this kind of thinking that perpetuates the very dissonance inherent in stereotypes. There is <i>so much</i> anti-racism/anti-sexism/anti-everything-slightly-inappropriate recently that some days I don't want to get out of bed. I <i>don't want</i> to watch what I say at every turn. I don't want to limit my vocabulary when there are so few English words in the first place. I don't want to change what I find funny because society has all of a sudden deemed it possibly inappropriate under certain situations. So what's the solution?<p>People need to start recognizing others as individuals--people need to start recognizing <i>themselves</i> as individuals. I'll admit it: I make inappropriate jokes <i>all</i> the time around my friends: every sort of inappropriate joke you can imagine. Why? Because the whole concept of shock humor is poking at things that are obviously not true. Why would people laugh if women actually were bad drivers (I am a terrible driver)? Why would they laugh if Asians could actually all do backflips (I broke a finger trying). If forking someone's repo was <i>actually</i> sexual, why would it be funny? ""I'm going to fuck her"" surely isn't funny.<p>The moment we all recognize that people are individuals, and not just subsets of classes, is the moment where all this ridiculousness will go away. Thinking that a blow to one woman hurts <i>all women</i> is as ridiculous as thinking a blow to one Asian hurts all Asians - or a blow to one person in tech who has large muscles is a blow to all people in tech who have large muscles. The association is ridiculous.<p>I don't know any women in tech. I know people in tech, and some of them just happen to be women.",1363935421

This event does not count as a routine. I'm sure that other people have made dick jokes at tech conferences, but 'routinely' strikes me as an overstatement.<p>Second, 'in public' doesn't really work either. Two friends were sitting next to each other and one made a joke to the other. That's not private, but it's not exactly public either. It wasn't broadcast to the whole room. Adria happened to be sitting close and paying attention to their conversation, but from the best information I've been able to piece together she was not a part of it and it wasn't said with the intention of anyone hearing it other than the guy's friend. That's not making the tech conference a guy space, it's making their semi-private conversation a guy space. That is not a problem.<p>Third, I shouldn't have engaged your argumentation with a comparison, because I disagree with a fundamental premise that my comparison lent credence to. Sexual humor is not gender-specific. Girls make dick jokes too. That's why I fundamentally find the cries of sexism and misogyny to be ridiculous. Many of my female friends make me look like a Puritan when it comes to the jokes they tell. This should never have become a gender issue, it should have been an issue of appropriate behavior at professional events. Adria made it a gender issue, and here we are.",1363934456

Conversely, if you're an employee of Foo, Inc. and you sign in to a secure server with your personal account and try to do something privileged, it's going to come back with ""401 Unauthorized"" and not give you anything even though you are actually authorized, and if you then sign in with your employee account it will allow you to do that thing.<p>As a general rule what the machine says has a very strong relationship with whether or not you're authorized to do something. The issue is that if you're not authorized then a properly functioning machine just won't let you do it, which means that it seems impossible for anyone to violate this law against a server that is working properly.<p>The only way anyone can be capable of breaking this law is if the server is not working properly and allows them to gain access without authorization. Which is why ""unauthorized access"" is such a vague and hopeless disaster. Going by the normal mechanism for determining whether you have authorized access, namely whether the server allows you to do something, would mean that no one could ever commit the crime, because either you never actually gain unauthorized access since you're prevented by a server with sufficient security, or you succeed in convincing the server to let you do something which under normal circumstances implies that you're authorized.<p>Seemingly the only way anyone would ever be convicted is based on a pile of circumstantial nonsense about how the defendant should have known they weren't authorized to do something that the server allowed them to do, even though normally you <i>are</i> authorized to do anything the server allows you to do.<p>So it becomes a de facto law against ""doing bad things with a computer"" -- not a specific prohibition against anything in particular, just something you stick to anybody who you don't like, because hey, if you did something ""bad"" then it wouldn't be authorized, right?",1363932786
