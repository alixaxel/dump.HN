It didn't discuss synthetic/cultured diamonds, which recently became available at 'low' prices. DeBeers needs to convince people that a cheaper diamond is worse, even though they're really better quality! Also, how come the internet hasn't shaken up their hold on the re-selling market? If diamond sellers won't buy back diamonds from people, why can't people sell to each other online?",1363755388

Oink had a 150 000 users within a quarter i believe but still shutdown, Pinterest were stuck on around 11000 users for a long time before they reached a tipping point. Life happens in spits and spurts, even looking at a stock chart, a companies stock price moves in a contraction expansion pattern. Bottom line we all get taught that the startup lifecycle follows a normal distribution but it is actually fat-tailed so is VC returns coincidentally.

5405712,comment,5404374,5404374,8,0,graycat,,,"As usual, Mark tells a good story by leaving out a lot.<p>So, he has ""(0.5%) eventually sell for $150 million or more"".<p>Okay, so what?  Is his argument that the chances of an entrepreneur are just a lottery draw with winning odds of 0.5%?  If so, then that's misleading.<p>Why?  Because it shouldn't be a lottery draw.  Instead, the entrepreneur should know more than just a lottery draw.  The entrepreneur should have done some good, careful, solid, and quite likely effective planning so that when, based on the additional information he has and the planning he has done, he goes for the $150 million or more, his chances are quite good, hopefully well over 50%.  If he can't plan that well, then he needs to learn how or get into another game.<p>VCs, including Mark, won't teach how to do such planning, won't help with the planning, won't evaluate the planning, and, instead, will just report the figure of 0.5% from just looking in simple terms at all the e-mail they receive or some such.<p>Although the odds may have looked like 0.5% from 50,000 feet up, it is quite possible that for the winners down on the ground the odds looked and were much better than that.<p>Net, it is quite possible to see a large need, think of a good solution, find a way to provide that solution, and plan a business to deliver that solution, even with some new, advanced technology, all with quite high probability -- all over our economy, all around the world, in many industries, people do such planning and execution with quite\nhigh probability.<p>E.g., when Intel decides to move from line width of some x nanometers to 0.66 x nanometers and build a $2 billion plant to manufacture at 0.66 x nanometers, do you believe that the project is high risk with only 0.5% chance of success?  BS.  Intel has taken many such steps in their history, and so far they may have had some delays and some kinks to iron out but never really had an actual failure.<p>E.g., recently movie director \nJames Cameron got in a specially \ndesigned 'boat' and took a little side trip to\nthe bottom of the Mariana Trench, about six\nmiles down or some such.  No one, not even all\nthe world together, has a lot of experience\nbuilding 'boats' to go six miles down.  So, what\nhe did was essentially for the first time.  Thus,\nhe needed a lot of quite good planning.  And he came\nup alive.  Lesson:  Planning to attack the unknown for\nthe first time is possible.<p>The great old lesson was the Wright Brothers.  Langley had just fallen into the Potomac River.  But the Wright Brothers took a train from Ohio to Kitty Hawk and flew apparently with little or no doubt.  Why?  Good planning.  How?  They built the first quite good wind tunnel and, thus, had some good data (although they missed Reynolds number) on wing lift and drag.  They also knew horsepower and thrust of their propellers.  They had the weight of their plane and passenger.  They understood the crucial role of three axis control and had a good enough solution.  A little arithmetic, and it was clear that they should be successful.  And they were.  First time.<p>Planning is doable.  Sorry, Mark.<p>Let's put it this way, drawing from Mark's post:  He did point out correctly that a house in the area will set one back about $2 million.  Well, if making that much money is as difficult as Mark suggests, then house prices should fall!<p>Are we learning yet, e.g., how to earn?<p>A good, old lesson, especially in business, is ""Always look for the hidden agenda."".  So, VCs are in the business of buying parts of young companies.  So, as a buyer, they want more inventory to select from.  So, Mark can tell CxOs that their slot is for just chump change and that they need to be CEO and get some VC funding.  And if they were a real man, they'd d be paying cash for a $2 million house, and for that they'd need to be a CEO with VC funding.  For more, a buyer wants to tell the seller that their product isn't very good, e.g., has only 0.5% chance of being worth $150+ million.  So, maybe such is part of Mark's agenda.<p>Then telling entrepreneurs how actually to plan a $150+ million exit, with some significant probability, is not part of the agenda.",1363754996

I tried several different path in order to get a visa status do my new startup, and found it's nearly impossible. It's a chicken and egg problem: you need a visa for yourself to be able to work legally for your startup, but it's nearly impossible to get yourself a working visa for a startup without enough capital, it's also nearly impossible to get funded if you don't even have a legal status to work full time for your startup... it's basically a dead loop. Our project as a moonlight side project got traction, got users, got reported in major US news (USA Today, ABC, CNN...) but sadly those only made my life tougher since I was in the risk of losing my job which keep my visa status -- which means my whole family will have to go back to the home country within a few days.<p>Fortunately I found EB-1A was a potential path and I went through it successfully, and I am now full time on my startup. But it's no fun at all to spend all the time in preparing immigration papers works instead of working on your startups when the momentum was there. Many of my friends find it's so entertaining to see my GC documents looks like, here is just a half part of it: <a href=""http://discoverful.com/photo/30461/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discoverful.com/photo/30461/</a><p>My story was covered by Immigrant Exodus last year:  <a href=""http://immigrantexodus.com/robert-mao-discoverful/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://immigrantexodus.com/robert-mao-discoverful/</a><p>Even though I went through this EB-1A process, I was just lucky that I did a lot of other stuff (published papers, got media reports, received awards, played critical roles etc.) which made me qualify for those EB1A criteria.<p>I would like to share my stories to help improve the US immigration system, to allow more entrepreneurs like myself to be able to have freedom to innovate and start new business here in US. The United States is build on entrepreneurship, let's make it better for entrepreneurs.<p>Robert Mao",1363754849

The database has to be pretty big and your application has to be rather important before database restore time becomes a deciding factor. Companies with huge databases and mission-critical applications should have the resources to make their database highly available.<p>Every time this relational vs. NoSQL topic comes up it's clear that few, if any, of the developers experimenting with MongoDB et al. have mission-critical apps with huge databases. They didn't look at Oracle or even PostgreSQL and come to a reasoned decision to risk everything on MongoDB because it can restore from backup faster. They don't have the patience or inclination to master a relational database, they want something that appears to work right away, and they don't know the consequences down the road of abandoning ACID -- if they even know what ACID is or why they want it. And then there's the coolness factor -- no points in the cube farm for advocating some stuffy old technology.<p>I know there are exceptions, and I frequently use non-relational data management solutions too (though not MongoDB -- no beta testing with real data for me, thanks).
