That's 500k people who have a pulse on this type of thing. The actual RSS user total must be much higher, I guess we'll see how much higher when Reader actually shuts down.  But whatever the number is, it's pretty clear that there are enough RSS users that a real business can be built on top of it, and indeed there were business built on top of it before Reader and I'm betting there will be real businesses built on top of it after Reader, but I find it <i>really</i> hard to look at what we know and not conclude that Reader had a profound impact in this space.<p>> The fact of the matter is that when Apple finally kills off the Mac Pro there actually won't be (lega) alternatives,<p>I don't know what you are talking about, the Mac Pro is a tower computer, there are many alternatives today and there will be many alternatives when the Mac Pro goes away, Apple doesn't dominate the tower computer market.",1363730398

Every time the Court does so, it uses up some of the Court's political capital, which is  ultimately the only thing the Court has to enforce its judgments. Even though I'm a liberal, I tend to be very skeptical of judicial activism because I think that political capital should be saved for when it is really necessary.",1363730370

I can tell you that a lot of what I've seen is that it's one-hundred percent completely worth the stress and fear of rejection if even one long-shot (in your mind) pays off.  I've had that happen to me firsthand, and I've seen it in other people.  The more experience you have dealing with tough problems, the better you'll be thinking about them, and tough interview problems by extension.  Just make your interview count as best you can, and step back and wait.  I promise it's worth it.",1363730366

5403878,comment,5402216,5402999,2,0,btcthinker,,,"You are correct, the HYPE around Bitcoin is built around a broken idea, but Bitcoin is built around a good idea. Indeed, the main purpose of Bitcoin is in fact to be a medium of exchange and as a unit of account. Bitcoin will be highly profitable for those who treat it as a store of value, until the market gets saturated, but the fact that they treat it as a store of value and hype it up will only expedite the market saturation process.<p>When that happens, then Bitcoin will maintain a steady price and it will serve its purpose as an efficient medium of exchange on the Internet without the need of a central authority. Until, of course, something better comes and replaces it.<p>Deflation is easily negated by the natural rate of inflation, which will always occur simply because of supply/demand economics. Natural inflation is actually healthy for the economy. Artificial inflation forces people, businesses and governments to depend on lending a lot more than on the money they earned. Note that lending will still continue with natural inflation, but the interest rates won't have to be kept artificially low (like they are now).",1363730293

5403854,comment,5402539,5402539,4,0,ruswick,,,"Rarely if ever do I find myself in agreement with Marco, but he articulates a valid point quite well. Monopolies and effective monopolies are obviously quite detrimental to the web, especially when they fail.<p>But, there is little that can be done about the tendency for monopolies to emerge within the web ecosystem, only to fail. If companies were to charge or advertise heavily from day one, it would effectively preclude any sort of viral, meteoric rise, because the overwhelming number of prospective users would turn their nose up at it. Most companies would never achieve widespread success. On the other hand, a lack of an organized business strategy leaves companies scrambling to devise revenue sources, as is happening with Facebook and their absurd gift card thing. Either one can try to make money and be relegated to obscurity, or one can become popular and end up exasperated at their inability to make money. There is very little opportunity to become both wildly successful and fiscally viable; that is why most companies fail.<p>As a user, I would prefer a lack of business model to a lack of a business: better to have an RSS reader (or social network, or mail client/to-do app) that lacks substancial income for 8 years than one with a direct business model that never gets off the ground.",1363729908

So backups are basically useless for anything bigger than ""trivial"". Master/Slave replication is death for HA.<p>MySQL has Master/Master, and is actually reasonably supported ""in the cloud"", so that's probably the only realistic option if you don't want to run your own hardware, need HA, and don't want to pay Oracle or MS.<p>AFAIK Oracle and MS both have decent HA solutions, but you're probably looking at $100K starting prices, and again, you're probably going to have to run your own hardware.<p>My #1 database of any type would be PostgreSQL. If it was HA. And if you could run a decent sized deployment (hundreds of GB) without having to run your own hardware.<p>I think this more than anything is probably why NoSQL is so popular with this (HN) crowd. Because in-Memory ""free"" databases are a good fit for people who don't have $100K to throw at a vendor in licensing, and who don't want to lease their own hardware.<p>RDBMSs are way behind the curve on that. Even for people like me who genuinely like them. Unless you're willing to go with MySQL I guess. But even then, do you trust RDS to be dependable and <i>fast</i>? Without a dedicated DBA?<p>I can goto Cloudant and get a database that's very fast, has relatively modest costs, I don't have to run my own hardware, and BigCouch (derivative) has a far better HA story than any RDBMS I'm aware of outside of maybe VoltDB (which I don't have any practical experience with).<p>I make some compromises on ACID, which I'm learning to be OK with. I lose transactions (which really hurts some things, but rolling your own 2PC on a case-by-case basis works passably when you really need the semantics). And I have a mostly-pleasant, sometimes very fragmented set of tools to help me work with my data. It's a living.<p>But I'm not responsible for the hardware. It's much cheaper. And it does HA. When PostgreSQL steps up and gets that right, I'll switch back.<p>Not to mention, there's no excuse for the amount of tuning a decent PostgreSQL install takes. Speaking as a guy who's built several 80K-TPS systems, the barrier to entry is needlessly high. Try MS-SQL sometime and contrast. Then again, PostgreSQL is free.<p>Plus the free RDBMSs need enforced clustered indexes. This crontab stuff is for chumps. 99% of the time an enforced cluster would be preferable to increased insert performance for 99% of web-apps.<p>/end-long-rambling-rantish-comment. :)",1363729044

The reason is simple:  Bitcoin is not a legal tender anywhere, nor does it enjoy any legal status as a currency anywhere.  Courts deal in fiat currencies, and both lenders and borrowers need to deal with the court system in case of default; until courts start dealing in Bitcoin, issuing a Bitcoin loan will only add complication to such proceedings.<p>In my view, Bitcoin will ultimately be little more than another way to make electronic payments.  Merchants will accept Bitcoin only to immediately trade the Bitcoin units for some fiat currency on a Bitcoin exchange.  Bitcoin exchanges will basically be payment processors.  This, of course, assumes that technical problems do not destabilize everyone's trust in Bitcoin as a secure payment system (and given that it fails to meet the formal definition of security used by cryptographers, I suspect that this is bound to happen).",1363727968

Of course it doesn't have to be that bad.<p>Anyway, the doctrine pushed at the time by cisco was embedding a password into a router was only for home or VERY small business users.  Anyone with more than, say, 4 routers or so should be using some form of network authentication.<p>We had network auth in the very early 00s although all our routers had an emergency console password configured in (had to use it once, looked like 80 characters of line noise, maybe it was).  That was in a sealed envelop in a lockbox.  Because he had to update every router manually if that envelope opened, our one security guy got pretty annoyed if anyone ripped the envelope open.<p>Anyway the point that might be missed is in a carrot and stick method, this might be a very extreme application of the stick to get people to use network AAA systems instead of configuring their console and enable passwords in each router.<p>I guess modern cisco routers/IOS can do LDAP and KERBEROS its not all RADIUS from 1993, although old stuff does work.<p>I will say that in the dark days before we went network AAA it was an absolute nightmare when someone on the team quit and someone had to go manually thru every router on the network and change the passwords and distribute the new one to us all.<p>This will negatively impact people with 1990s architecture, but to the extent that they're already in a living hell anyway it won't be much worse.<p>Unfortunately I've worked at a few places with non-internet connected routers (or so they thought, anyway) where documentation was so poor you basically had to break in each time you needed access.  Physical access to do hard recovery via a reboot was a PITA.  Making it ""easier to break in"" would be seen as a feature not a bug in those locations.",1363727022

In this case, about the total amount of something, and whether what you're encountering is a valid instance of it.  Check out some examples and how Bitcoin compares:<p>Gold has chemical properties that ensure its finite scarcity (though supplies can fluctuate) and allow you to identify it as ture gold (through, e.g. density measurements).  \nGold-backed paper currency has a scarcity determined by the trustworthiness of its issuer and a validity linked to the difficulty of its reproduction.\nFiat paper currency has a feature of allowing a fractional reserve system, which allows a central body to control its scarcity (and perceptions thereof), with validity again linked to difficulty of reproduction.\nOpen-source cryptographic currencies have a well-defined scarcity and easily verifiable validity.<p>Cryptography provides certainty better than a physical alternative like gold or paper, but governments traditionally have had control over currency and don't have control over Bitcoin.  I think it's unlikely they'll give this up without a fight.  I'm not sure that the token system you propose really gives them back that control unless it supports fiat: the arbitrary issuance or discontinuation of currency.  But, the idea of Bitcoin as specie is a great one.  If it is adopted it as such it becomes open to confiscation like FDR did with gold in 1933, which is an interesting prospect:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102</a><p>I wonder confiscation is even possible?
