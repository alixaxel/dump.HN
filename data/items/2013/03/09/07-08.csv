The standard combination lock interface is well-known, not intuitive. ""6-38-16"" is brief, but it assumes the listener already knows to translate that to ""turn right 360 degrees, then right 6, left 38, right 16"". This lock doesn't seem any worse in that regard.",1362815909

The facts are clear: the average computer user doesn't care about an operating system that much. It's a means to an end. Most people are just using their OS as a portal to access media anyway so they really don't care.<p>Yes Canonical/Ubuntu has brought in a lot of new users but the simple fact is if you want the platform to keep advancing you need geeks. Suzy soccer mom and Bob the casual user are a great audience to attract but they aren't going to writing the next breakthrough software or fixing major bugs. They might bring money to fund the development and that's great, but once you shut us out we'll go to another distro and make that one better.<p>If he was a true leader he would diplomatically find a way to attract the widest audience possible. By intentionally provoking the same people who built Linux he's just ensuring that someday they'll move to something else that will blow them out of the water.",1362815846

The number of security holes is proportional to the trusted code size.<p>I thought that Java had a pretty good record until recently.  As I wrote in a previous comment, what may have happened is that Windows and Flash and other ubiquitous client software really cleaned up their act in the last few years.  So hackers started going for the JVM and Adobe Reader as vectors.  The JVM wasn't under as much scrutiny when Windows was wide open, although that was quite a few years ago.<p>I wouldn't rule out other possible reasons either, e.g. the fact that there may have been a huge brain drain in JVM talent after the Oracle acquisition.

In a previous post here on HN, somebody said in a comment, that the Sim City infrastructure runs in Amazon's infrastructure.<p>Isn't one of the big advantages of cloud computing the ability to scale your hardware with demand? Why only scale up by 130% when there's still people having problems? Why not scale until everybody has a good experience?<p>I don't even think it's going to cost all that much: after the initial onrush, the number of concurrent sessions is likely going to drop rapidly, at which point, they can easily scale down the infrastructure (maybe forcing regions to be consolidated, but as a player I'd rather suddenly have a new neighbor city than a ghost town because my neighbor stopped playing).<p>If you can scale up by 130% in one week, you can also scale up by 500%. Or however much it takes.<p>Them not doing this, leads to twoconclusions: 1) they don't care about the current ire among gamers. If the game is good, the rocky start will be forgiven when in two weeks time load normalizes and it will be forgotten within a month. And 2) having overloaded servers due to ""unanticipated demand"" is in the long run good news to give, increasing the perceived value and quality of the game.",1362813523

A service might be very valuable, but it's probably replaceable. If someone is geolocating IPs for you, hosting images for you, handling blog comments for you, this is all stuff someone else could do for you if your first-choice API turns into yet another /dev/null.<p>The other kind of API is access to specific content and/or networks. This is a whole different ball of wax, and I would be wary of doing anything significant with an API that is only valuable because of the value of the data that is coming over it. You have to ask yourself very carefully why they are giving you access. Most likely it is because they think you will drive growth to them. Once that motivation is gone because they have reached scale, they will stop treating you as valuable, and start to see all the value you generate as value that is not being sent their way: they will start rent-seeking.<p>Basically, ask yourself: if some API that you use were to close up shop, would your company no longer have an existential purpose? If you want to give people directions to a brick-and-mortar store, and Google Maps closed itself off tomorrow, would your company cease to exist? Hopefully the answer is no, you would just have to spend some resources and switch to someone else or build it yourself.",1362813187

(example was a donation, but Amazon does this when not defaulting to free 5-7 day ground shipping <i>after promising free shipping prior to putting it in cart!</i> which is much worse since they are bait and switching)<p>* Opt-in, part 2: Making changes subtle changes can be evil. By switching around buttons, etc. after having it work a certain way a long time and not changing the interface enough, you trigger muscle memory to do the wrong thing. Amazon has exploited this as well with the (not) free shipping option.<p>* Difficult to quit/cancel: also mentioned in the OP's linked presentation. In addition to more steps or having to email, etc. they don't even give you a documented option, e.g. you have to email them so they will delete your account and they say that nowhere in the site.<p>* Glossing over legal: Small text or less readable font to hide details is evil.<p>* Hiding legal: putting legal disclaimers in an area of the site that is hard to get to is evil.<p>* Unnecessary login: making the user login because they <i>might</i> want to retain info about something, when really the site owner is getting more benefit (selling email address or lead info, mining it themselves, etc.).<p>* Asking for more than is needed for user to accomplish what they want: asking the user for more info than they need to provide in order to get lead info <i>when they are not aware you will contact them</i> is evil.<p>* Unintended use of data: Worked for a telecom that had page to get phone# to look up service availability and then they would use that for lead info.<p>* Easy to determine security questions: this is just stupid. Many are easy to find out and they do little more than make the uninformed user feel more secure. Examples: birthday, street you grew up on, etc. that can be learned even without social engineering.<p>* Passwords: one of the most archaic and stupid constructs ever. Passwords encourage people to use the same password across sites, so if one is compromised, they all are. An autogenerated passkey and a more secure way to reset it with a new one if your passkey was lost or stolen would beat passwords anyday. SSO only compounds this idiotic UX we can't get rid of.
