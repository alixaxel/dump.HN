However, almost all companies are keeping track of their revenue-per-employee, and it's fairly common around here to remark that your company is not yet doing well until that number hits about $200,000/man-year.  Apple and Google and the like have about double that.<p>At that level of revenue, yes, there are taxes and capital costs to pay, but you can also afford damn fine salaries, too.",1363499852

I'm not advocating either way, but there's lots of young people essentially publicly confessing to crimes (pictures of them vandalizing, screenshots of text messages about planning to steal clothes from the mall, and plenty of teenage angst). I feel a bit creepy for looking at their pictures, but also shocked they're so revealing to the public. How clear does instagram make it that your photos are public? Is it ignorance or apathy on the part of the teens?",1363499787

Its not about optimizingtweets and other content to be seen by those not following you, but following and searching for your tagged topics. Many more networks with topic hashtagging are in the plans for integration, as our first users tell us how they need to tag their photos, images, and  goods better to get seen more, and thus sell more.  Rather than rush to add every social network with an open API, we focus on relevancy and honing the results in the RiteTag Reports.",1363499545

Hype works so well in this industry that it's hard to fault people who balance the risk of blowback against the fact that hype gives a real boost to the already slim chances of big success.<p>Especially when you follow the industry and see who wins and how much hype they (and their competitors) went with.

5388303,comment,5385523,5386498,2,0,chipsy,,,"I'm embarrassed to show it since I only have parts of a system right now, not a finished system. But as I implied in the OP, the code I'm writing is mostly conventional algorithms and data structures; the twist is in some subtle detail that ripples out towards the top level. I'll give some examples which will hopefully be more instructive than a code dump.<p>One of my targets was the entity system used to describe a scene in video games. Conventionally this involves an OO hierarchy of some kind, either compositional or inheritance based. The problem is that you don't know up front all of the sorts of properties an entity will need and what algorithms it will work with; the integration of the various subsystems acting upon an entity is a high-maintenance area and tends to involve messy boilerplate data tracking. I pursued the problem further, and came up with a way to move the integration process out of the subsystems code.<p>This was done by creating a customized set of collections(array, key-value, bag) that associate their data against an entity structure, can handle multiple instances of data associated against the same entity, can efficiently access data of a specific entity, and can remove all of the data related to that entity upon a despawn request. Once these constraints are satisfied, the only thing each subsystem has to do is work with those collections.<p>Also of interest, and still in progress, is an implementation of J. Paul Morrison's ""Flow Based Programming"" concepts to control overall program structure. I was looking around at ways to minimize coupling, and this particular method added a degree of structure and contractual behavior.<p>The first thing that happened after taking on this concept was to work through the ramifications for interactive programs: I had to start with a big data structure containing all the state, and then split it out and merge it together to attain synchronized behaviors. This in turn motivated the entity system idea. It's a very spatial model, so I am now doing some work on a graphical tool.<p>NoFlo is an example of a more finished FBP implementation than mine: <a href=""http://noflojs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://noflojs.org/</a><p>I have some other ideas too, but they're in a very early stage so there's little to say. Having prior experience in the domain is a huge help, and I wouldn't be taking this approach to conquer arbitrary new problems. I'd try to make at least one mess first ;)",1363498999

Screwed it up so bad that most people actually resent it. Not only is going to the post office comparable to a bad visit to the dentist but just try to make sense of their services [2].

Instead I have to wait 30 minutes in a slightly dilapidated room, with service change signs dated back to 2004 and ask for ""First Class mail with tracking and delivery confirmation"".

I'd expect you to set your pricing low enough that I should never even consider trying to roll my own, so low I never even bother to lookup the docs to see how hard it might be.  As pseut says, the upper tiers are so expensive that you just motivated anyone considering that volume to go off and do the build/buy analysis.<p>I hope this is constructive feedback.  There are lots of other good suggestions here on how to make your landing page convert better.
