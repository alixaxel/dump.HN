If you keep your money in the form of dollars (or Euros) shoved into a mattress the value can go away through inflation. If you keep your money in the form of gold bars the value can also go away through inflation, but perhaps less so.",1363481992

It would be significantly more complicated to dissolve the whole European Union and dealing with a political and legal mess that would ensue. Dissolving the Eurozone would be comparatively easy.<p>Also the concept that somehow ""poorly run smaller economies"" were draining the resources of the ""larger economies"" has no basis in reality. It doesn't take a lot of research to find out who benefited the most from the Euro. Hint: not any the ""poorly run smaller economies"".",1363481976

They would have never gone to a farmer and taken 10% of their grain. They would have never gone and taken physical property in peoples home. That would had been an complete impossibility.

My focus was on ancient philosophy, in particular on Epicurean philosophy, in particular on a Roman Epicurean named Lucretius, in particular on Book 3 of his <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, in particular about his arguments against the fear of death in that book, in particular about the structure, formal & logical analysis and evaluation of his argument for the thesis that ""death is nothing to us"" in the later portion of Book 3. (<i>De Rerum Natura</i> is a Roman philosophical poem from the mid-first century BCE. Lucretius and his poem are getting a lot of press recently because of a book called <i>The Swerve</i> by Stephen Greenblatt.)<p>The linked guide to PhDs made me smile, and it rings true to me for non-sciences. As an undergraduate I was a Comparative Literature major with lots of credits in Latin, Greek and Philosophy. Once I got to graduate school for Classics, my studies became increasingly concentrated in smaller and smaller areas of an already small field (Greco-Roman antiquity).<p>tl;dr I think literature and philosophy PhDs are also pimples of knowledge.<p>As for whether or not we expand human knowledge, that depends on how you define ""human knowledge"" and ""expand"", I suppose. I think it's charitable to say that (many? some?) people produce PhDs that expand human knowledge of Homer and Dante and James Joyce and Plato and Nietzsche and so on and so on. But of course if your definition of ""knowledge"" only makes room for numerical or quantifiable or experimental subjects, then you may disagree. I arguably expanded the world's knowledge of <i>De Rerum Natura</i>. My work has been cited at least once that I know of in subsequent work on the Epicureans, and not by me. (That's not just a joke: I remember reading that a large percentage of <i>all</i> research across disciplines is only ever cited again by the original author. I find that depressing.)
