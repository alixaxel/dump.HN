Yes, I know the company is book building, but if a company out there is going to go public, a public institution should be calling BS from a valuation stand point, and amend the ""Risk Factors"" of the company accordingly.<p>My point 3 was an in-extremis case. Nevertheless FO's are a very common and inexpensive instrument, and it is a shame that the public investor doesn't have access to this BS detector.",1362297562
5312910,comment,5310602,5310831,3,0,grey-area,,,"Most rails apps use nothing like that amount of memory, the norm is more like 80-150MB. There are various factors which affect how much memory you use and of course if your processes are leaking memory they could easily grow over time and hit any limit. Rails itself is taking up around 30MB, so this is all about the specific app code. Another common problem is loading lots of records into memory (say fetching all your user records at once), this will allocate but then not free lots of memory. Personally I find passenger handles this perfectly well out of the box without having to worry too much about memory usage, routing or other issues, but it does require keeping an eye on the app code as the app grows and fixing any issues that come up with memory usage or response time. Those are not problems specific to rails.<p>Without knowing the specifics it's hard to say for sure, but I really think RG should try a comparison with running their own real VM (not a web worker on heroku) and see how well it runs. If they'd done that they'd probably find and fix the reasons that their processes are taking so long to respond and taking up such a huge amount of memory,  because they'd feel more ownership of those problems, instead of playing a blame game with heroku.<p>This is not rocket science but it is a series of trade offs and heroku seem to have optimised for short running processes which don't take up lots of memory - many web apps run that way and would be happiest with random routing. Yes heroku could do better but at some point you have to take responsibility for your own ops instead of expecting some service to abstract away all the hard stuff, particularly if you're seeing performance issues and have a busy site. The amount they're paying heroku would easily pay for far more vps than they need.<p>So in summary, Heroku is not for everyone, and rails isn't really the problem here, so there are no enormous penalties for using it, just the sort of problems you see running any web app.",1362297544

5312903,comment,5310592,5311678,1,0,antr,,,"> the fundamentals of Groupon matter, but growth in the abstract (not just YOY revenue growth) is difficult to evaluate<p>Yes, forecasting growth is tough BUT if you have a price to start from, you can very easily back-solve the growth rate of a companies revenues, cash flow, etc. You don't have to be a genius to extrapolate that at a +$13bn equity valuation Groupon needed to achieve spectacular growth and cashflow generation over that next 5-7 years. Once you observe the implied growth rates, margins and cash-flow needed to be achieved one can genuinely analyse and criticise a valuation.<p>> That is a terrible idea. How do you define ""fairness?"" Again, given that the inherent definition of ""value"" is essentially (in a market economy)...<p>I don't think you understood my point. I'm not talking about something being fair (like you refer ""fairness"") or not, I'm talking about a Fairness Opinion or FO. An FO is an exercise that investment banks, auditors, consultants and other qualified parties, do on a daily basis. In the corporate world, specially with public companies, when a tender offer is received or presented an ""independent"" party provides a FO to inform investors and other stakeholders (primarily the board), that the offer is priced as expected or it is too high or too low. Issuing an FO is one of the most market friendly, pro free-market, instruments/exercises out there, instead of just dumping shares at a dubious valuation while deep-throating ""unqualified"" investors.<p>>But I remember at the time that even though I saw that the fundamentals were weak, I personally could not be sure of myself because I saw my mother and many of her female friends (also mothers) buy tons and tons of Groupons. Hindsight is 20/20.<p>I'm not saying that Groupon is not a viable business. I believe the contrary, I think there is a good business somewhere. But a good businesses can be under- and over-valued. The fact that people use Groupon doesn't make a ridiculous valuation justifiable.<p>> Again, given that the inherent definition of ""value"" is essentially (in a market economy) the highest price someone is willing to pay...<p>What you refer to here is the Price you are willing to pay; Value is a different thing. Any serious valuation exercise uses a discounted cash flow model driven by a solid operational model. Any other methodologies are simply hocus pocus. I suggest you read ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham. It was published over 60 years ago, but it is as useful today as it was back then. This book distills value investing from speculation. Let me just finish by saying that the recent financial crisis, specially that of the US housing was due to the decoupling of prices and value; understanding both will be of value (no pun intended).",1362297044

5312897,comment,5310911,5311395,1,0,jessriedel,,,"> 2W/m^2 for wind and ... 22W/m^2 for photovoltaic.<p>This is a misleading number for my point that wind is denser than solar.  For solar, the 22W/m^2 is spread out evenly an area, and you must put something (either photovoltaic or a mirror) to collect it.  For wind, you only need a single turbine to effectively cover a relatively large area.  The density number comes from the fact that, by virtue of how winds are generated and blow, you can't just stick a second turbine right next to the first one. From a cost per kWh perspective, the important number is more like the number of watts generated by single turbine with a 1 meter x 1 meter footprint.",1362296971

That is, while the state retreated (and thus provided the same nothing to people) The SEZs and then then state-turned private and new private enterprise filled the void granting people hope and a vision of a future.  People felt (and still feel, altho it might be on the descent) that if not they, their heirs have a chance at the future which they did not.  On the other hand China is relatively natural resource poor and Russia is NR rich.<p>It would seem the transition was handled better by China than their fraternal twin, the SU.  The unhurried transition probably helped, as well as culture (a Chinese family is willing to sacrifice a generation, if it has a promise of hope for the next -long view).",1362296886

That's just how it was for the computer storage industry (the example in the book) in the second half of the twentieth century.<p>It says that you have to start with a <i>new market</i> - i.e a set of people who want to buy your product who are different fundamentally from the existing market.<p>Plenty of innovations are rolled out starting at the high end. An obvious example is the iPhone (which changed the smartphone market from business/hobbiest to consumer, and which began doing that with rich consumers).<p>Another way of looking at it... New things can be relatively expensive within their new market - the first PCs were very expensive, they just happened to be cheap compared to Minicomputers. From a product side, they looked like cheap, crap computers. From the market side, they had a <i>totally different</i> market (e.g. individual finance professionals, rather than large corporations).<p>It's natural as a geek to look just at products.

The way people commonly use ""smart"" (high IQ, basically) isn't super-correlated with what Chris is talking about.

You can redefine ""smartest"" to mean ""those who turn out to have been most ahead of their time"", but that's circular and doesn't help identify the quality.<p>The body of the post uses the word ""hobby"", though, and that's much better.
