You can ssh into a box, provision it however you want, save that image off, and then run arbitrary commands/scripts on instances of that image, on the CPU type you want, and pay only for the seconds of usage you have. (Their ""s1"" core type is $0.04/hour: <a href=""http://www.picloud.com/pricing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.picloud.com/pricing/</a> ) They also have a system that lets you mount the same shared ""drive"" from multiple instances at the same time, so if you're doing file-based stuff, it's easy.<p>The thing I like about it is that running another instance of your script on a new machine (or 2k of them) is trivial.
