5367870,comment,5365096,5365474,2,0,ef4,,,"> It's not really possible without adding resources (ie a new server).<p>That's not quite true. With the right architecture, performance will degrade gracefully. You'll get slower and slower responses as the load goes up, and eventually start dropping requests, but the servers will not die and there will be no cascading failure.<p>One way to achieve this is to make sure the queuing happens at the load balancer, and no large queues are allowed to build up in the individual application servers.",1363175879

I've not spent much time looking into the advantages of cloud servers but can you at least give me a quick list of reasons you think your service is worth so much more?<p>I'm guessing the key is only spinning up what you need.  Doing a quick calculation of peak times for my services, which is about 12 hours per day not including weekends the cost drops to about 300 per month.  But this doesn't take into account the overhead of having to plan and implement something that can spin up resources when unexpected traffic hits.<p>I can see the value in your service for low value customers whose blogs suddenly hit the front page of HN or reddit for example .. but the cost of servers and rack space is so low I find it hard to justify the massive cost involved in cloud servers when you can just rack stupid amounts of computing power for such a low cost yourself.",1363175464

5367840,comment,5367275,5367516,1,0,chinpokomon,,,"Interesting. The close parentheses form of division from 1540 looks like the basis of the long division form of division, i.e. 2)6 with a bar or vinculum, extending from the top of the parentheses over the 6. The long division form finally takes its modern form in 1888. The transformation of that symbol seems somewhat obvious and natural.\nI wonder if we are likely to see further changes, as modern typesetting should resist the variations that handwriting would introduce. I believe any change in the future will have to demonstrate improved readability before it will be accepted.",1363175163

This creates a big disincentive to spend and pretty much kills any idea of lending. What's more it concentrates wealth in the hands of people who put in a comparatively small effort a long time ago and now hold BTC, compared to those producing economic output now, meaning that <i>if</i> it became common currency we'd end up with even more extreme division of wealth than we see now.<p>Note that I don't necessarily agree with the 'assumption' that BTC will collapse, that some people use to justify calling it a Ponzi or Pump'n'Dump scheme, but I do think it would be a terrible choice of primary currency for the reasons I've given.",1363173630
