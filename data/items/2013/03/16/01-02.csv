5384038,comment,5381428,5382892,1,0,cbhl,,,"Sadly, this is sucky on both ends of the equation.<p>When I interned at Facebook two years ago, it was a PITA to change the API to work around bugs that were fixed in old versions of FB4A because people wouldn't upgrade -- whereas the vast majority of iOS users upgraded the Facebook app within days of a new release showing up in the App Store. The addition of non-Play devices makes this even worse.<p>Granted, I had my own reasons for not wanting to upgrade, so I can sympathize with users, too. (Facebook was pre-installed on my device, and upgrading caused it to take up space in the 180 MB volatile/userdata partition on my Nexus One. I eventually solved the issue by buying a Galaxy Nexus, but I recognize not everyone can buy new phones that frequently.)",1363398772

5384034,comment,5382366,5383527,5,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It's a general feeling, mostly. Google seems to be growing more and more out of touch with its users in general. Some major warning signs for a company going down this road are: pet projects being given importance well beyond any hard-headed rational assessment; ""strategy tax"" behavior, making decisions which only make sense in the broader sense of serving the ""greater good"" of advancing a platform or what-have-you; making big decisions that are out of touch with what the market/public wants; using sheer size and resources as a market weapon instead of letting competition do its work.<p>Google's social endeavors have always shown them to be out of touch and incapable of engaging the market with a product that people care about (orkut, knol, buzz, wave, and now plus). Their approach to ""customer service"" for many of their products is to actively disconnect from their users and let the natural release cycle take care of things. They have a long history of ugly interfaces with poor usability. Youtube is a good example, discoverability of new content has only gotten worse over the years and many fundamental features are really very broken or at best poorly implemented (such as playlists), despite being an otherwise mature product. They've killed off lots of small products and projects for the sin of not fitting in to the grand strategy. And they've tried as much as they dare to force people into using google+ whether they want to or not.<p>Google still has a huge number of world-class engineers, and that will enable them to continue making some truly great things over the next years and perhaps decades. But fundamentally google is on a track toward becoming just another run-of-the-mill mega-corp, and if they continue along that route eventually a lot of the talent is going to evaporate away (as has happened and is continuing to happen at MS) and there won't be anything to save them from mediocrity.",1363398598

Most people are going to trust that Google has a better chance long-term, even if the product has a chance of going away some day. I am always leery of my data with small companies, and make sure there is a good backup/exit strategy (obviously, this applies to Google too).<p>I see a lot of passionate tweets over just another web service. If Google wasn't killing the service, but asking users to spread the word to keep the service, would they be so passionate about it then? Maybe. People don't often go to Twitter when their service is working, generally when they're pissed (unless the service is mind-blowing great).

5384001,comment,5383310,5383310,1,0,Zenst,,,"Well one strength you have already would be in user testing as your mind is infetted by the `how would a computer do this best` approach towards interfacing with users.<p>You could start by looking and reviewing and spotting bugs in many programs out there, will help build a resume and also at the same time perk your interest into what tech scene angle you wish to start heading down.  Be it codeing, design, testing, support, managing, selling, testing, providing.  That is without even looking at the market area's within those feilds which could be anything from games, web, plant, automation, planes trains and automobiles, or washing machine spin cycle control systems.  Many area's within area's.  Tech is such a large feild and this is just the basic computing stuff.  Designing new solar panels, specialist clothing, you see what I mean, such an open subject.<p>Two things I would advise keeping in mind.  What are you good at and what do you like.  It is a fine balance and to do the things you like you might not earn as much and work all hours bluring the lines between hobby and work.  You could focus on what you are good at and treat it as work, have more time and money to focus on those hobbies and pet projects and get better quality time doing them how you enjoy them.  It is extremly rare to fully combine the two, even then it will not be all the time.  You can spend a long time chasing that end-goal and end up becoming disenjanted with what you enjoy.  So a fine balance is advisable and by all means learn your own balance.  Being mindful of that will help you be more objective and happier in the long run.  Dreams can become nightmares, don't spoil the dream.  So tread slowly, but firmly and you will know what you are good at and what your are not, so even if you descide to go another direction all together.  You would of learned good foundations for any path forward.<p>So my suggestion in short - levridge your skill you have now and that is you are the perfect user, so testing/QA would be a great start and one you can define.  You will then know which area of tech you wish to focus upon, though will gain the eye for detail early on which is handy in all walks of life.",1363397876

I should be able to subscribe to that entire circle with one click, and have it appear as a subgroup on the left sidebar, and the, Presto, we have 50% of Google Reader.<p>I would suggest Reader be replaced (if it must) with G+ Curator, a reader for feeds including RSS and Atom, but also G+ Circles, third party feeds like Twitter or Tumbler (if possible), mayabe Google Groups or even a gmail filter.<p>I would use the Reader API for this, it's basically an atom feed aggregator, and could convert all those other inputs into Atom feeds the same as it does Atom and RSS today. I would translate the current feed IDs into G+ ids.<p>The problem with Google dropping RSS is it basically kills the prospect of sites bothering with RSS, they look to Tumblr and the like and think there's something there, but they find they can't easily browse other feeds, and it becomes like Facebook (now), a mess of pithy sayings and 'viral' photographs that people probably don't bother to read.\nThen, at some point Tumblr (or some other site) shuts down and the community goes with it, the orgranization is lost and the users find something else to waste their time on.<p>But really, unless Google looks at fixing problems with G+ and makes it something that people want to use, we'll be not talking about it's shutdown a year or two from now",1363396690

Some people glamorize things they don't know, others have a passion but were slow starters, other still know there is gold there, but don't have the experience to understand how to get it.<p>I think the best thing is to be able to weed out the ones who truly are passionate about technology and are willing to learn. I would take someone super enthusiastic with an aptitude for learning and no technical skills over most others any other day.<p>I would also point out that the author implicitly suggests no technical skill = no skills, though it could simply be sloppy writing.<p>The community definitely needs more blog entries telling non-technical people to learn how to code.",1363395820

I agree with some of the other comments about the usability on an ipad and mobile device as well as scrolling the screen to the focused element. I think larger targets would really help with this.<p>At this point in its development, if you are able to use jQuery or Zepto I think that Joyride 2 offers a much better UI / UX especially if you are planning to use Foundation 3/4.",1363395719
