You don't need to be afraid of locks so much as find something that handles them well along with whatever else you need. In Ada there exist ""protected"" objects and types, a protect object being either a singleton or an instantiation of a protected type. Protected types are one way to synchronize threads and provide access control to data safely. There are protected entries with queues, protected functions which can only read the data being protected and protected procedures which while having the ability to write to protected data are guaranteed to only be allowed access one at a time. There's plenty of great features of the built-in tasking to go along with protected objects like selective entries, time delayed aborts and a ton of other stuff. Ada really hits the mark for locking. If you don't want locks, but still want synchronization, there's also the Ada rendezvous. Good stuff and even more robust with the new 2012 standard.",1364449282

5453445,comment,5451651,5451916,12,0,derefr,,,"> I want a better Erlang than Erlang, but talking yourself into how Go is already better than Erlang isn't going to get you there.<p>I don't mean to go against this point--it's very true, and I think it's important--but I think this conversation (and most comparisons of Go with Erlang) miss something: Erlang is a <i>platform</i> (it has its own VM, and basically its own OS, just relying on the outer OS as a hypervisor.) Meanwhile, Go isn't a platform, nor is it trying to be. Its designers (Rob Pike and Ken Thompson) already <i>made</i> the platform, first, a long time ago. It was called Unix.<p>These folks are <i>serious about Unix</i>--they want you to use it. They aren't going to reimplement Unix on top of Unix if they can help it. Unix is already the native set of abstractions they think in terms of[1]. An Erlang ""release"" (VM + source) should be compared to an entire Unix VM with a disk containing some Go binaries; not just a blob of Go source on its own.<p>Which is to say, the equivalent of the OTP exists for Go, but it isn't <i>in</i> Go--it's in Unix. OTP services are fundamentally ""platform-level"" things, and Unix provides them. Where are supervision trees? They're in upstart(8). Where is logging? rsyslog(8) will do it. And so forth.<p>There's nothing wrong with treating an individual Go <i>process</i> as equivalent to an Erlang <i>process</i> (other than overhead, but that's a problem with your Unix implementation, not with Unix as a platform). Make each Go process (that is, Go binary) have a single responsibility, so it can crash on its own. Then, give it a supervisor who can restart it with the right state. Some processes will still need to be larger, of course--goroutines still serve a purpose--but when the process crashes, you'll lose all of that, so don't put everything in there.<p>Since you now have multiple Go processes running, you'll need to do IPC. It's Unix: do it with sockets. What do you send on them? You can import a raw struct-specifier header file (or a whole client stub library, like in Erlang) from the include/ directory of each other process that specifies types it will understand, and then speak that ""protocol"" to it. Or you can use a ProtoBuf spec, to make your process more friendly for third-party use. Or, you can use plain text, like most Unix processes.<p>A single goroutine in each Go process should manage reads from this socket, deserialize the messages coming from it, and stuff them on channels relevant to their meaning. Then, the other parts of your process that care about external messages can receive on those channels when they wake up. Sounds a lot like an Erlang process inbox, doesn't it?<p>And so forth.<p>I think a lot of people are used to languages that provide their own insular inner-platform (Ruby, Python, Erlang, C#, Java, etc.) with its own implementation of everything from process scheduling to message passing to bytecode format to exception-handling, and think that Go is another one of these. Go is not this. Go is, despite all its modern trappings, ""better C"", and like C, it is heavily bound to Unix for most of the <i>operations stuff</i> that is important to high-availability et al.<p>Try Go <i>with Unix</i>--it might change your opinion on how many decades of hard-won experience Go is leaning on :)<p>---<p>[1] Well, okay, their abstraction-set probably hews closer to Plan 9 these days; Go even uses the term ""runes"" to refer to Unicode code-points and so forth. Still, all the ideas are backportable without too much of a fight.",1364448639

It may also help in the off chance the right person sees it and likes it.<p>A couple comments: 1. I've intentionally broken some links to content I don't want posted in this version 
2. Part of me is nervous about posting this to the wild. I've copied SpaceX's base webpage without explicit permission, but my intentions are good and believe it's an innocent use of their source code. If some of you disagree, I'll take it down. 
3. If anyone works/knows anyone that works at SpaceX, feel free to put in a good word for me =)

I find that people with mood disorders tend to either be very bad or very good at startups, depending on whether or not they have learned to manage their diseases. It sounds like you jumped in without learning to manage your depression first. It should be pretty obvious to you by now that a startup exacerbates the highs and the lows. What might not be obvious is that once you learn to deal with your depression, those same skills will transfer over to weathering the emotional roller coaster ride that comes with the territory of building and scaling a company. You have to fix your depression before you can expect anything to get better. Focus on that, first. A doctor would help, but isn't the only possibility. There are other options, from counselors to breakthrough.com to a copy of <i>I'm O.K., You're O.K.</i> and a good friend to talk to. And there are many things you can do for yourself, like exercise, take Omega 3's, keep a journal, and practice some form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, hopefully with a professional, but if all else fails, you would be surprised how far you can get just winging it with someone who cares about you. I hope you feel better, soon. But don't be surprised or discouraged if it takes a while. Maybe this startup works out, maybe it doesn't. But if you do decide to ""give up"", at least don't give up from a depressed frame of mind. You'll regret it, trust me.",1364447385
