At any time, officials could have \n  entered our property to find the source of the overflow.\n</code></pre>\nNot in Texas, they don't.  The city water/sewer department or sewage treatment company (or district) does not have right of entry into a property unless invited by the subscriber.  The subscriber has the duty to ensure that the equipment on his or her property is functioning as designed.  That is why laws requiring water sprinkler backflow valves are enforced at the junction between the city's water pipe and the customer's water pipe.  The city or supply company shut off the valve on their side of the pipe.  Property demarcation is a huge thing in Texas.<p><pre><code>  The city of Dallas apparently knew \n  there was a problem on December 9th, but allowed it to \n  continue and did not notify us until 41 days later when \n  government agencies served search warrants.\n</code></pre>\nThis I can believe (I mean, lolcityofdallas amirite?) but it does not absolve the property owner of liability for failure to maintain the sanitary sewer connection on his property.<p><pre><code>  The city maintains a box on our sewer line that has for \n  years monitored the amount of waste water going through \n  the line and the substances contained in the waste \n  water.  The city monitors this locked box on its own \n  schedule.\n</code></pre>\nAnd when your sewer bill was half of what it should be, this didn't raise any eyebrows?  If there's one thing Dallas Water Utilities does shockingly well, it's collect money from ratepayers.<p>I think that sending in the mod squad and filing charges was overkill.  The Trinity has been used and abused for decades and people are just now trying to clean it up, so it doesn't shock me that TCEQ and Dallas dropped the hammer on this fellow.",1362214780

At this point I feel you should specify what you consider an artistic pursuit""</i><p>RISD is a very small school.  Only 2,282 students total.  According to [1], they had 835 admissions, with a 34% acceptance rate.  If my math is right, that makes for 2,455 applicants.<p>Julliard is even smaller (800 students), though much more selective.  According to [2], they had 2,138 applicants (of which they admitted 162 -- an 8% acceptance rate).<p>So that's 4,420 total applicants to RISD and Julliard combined.<p>According to [3], there were 3.3 million high school graduates in 2008.  That would make for 0.13% (or about 1 out of 1000) high school graduates ""pile on"" Julliard and RISD.  While 999 out of 1000 don't apply to either school (and the overwhelming majority of those probably not to any kind of art career path at all).<p><i>""No, actually beyond basic high school math many people never touch math again. Not even calculus.""</i><p>Ok.  But how much math did they take by the time they make it through high school math?  Maybe 9, 10, or even 12 years of math.  Which is probably an order of magnitude more than they have years of art.<p><i>""You talk about the ones on their way to becoming engineers and such. That's like complaining that people at chef school take more cooking classes than astrophysics classes. You talk about engineers, programmers, and scientists like everyone's just lining up at the door to become one.""</i><p>Well, let's take a look at the 10 most popular majors in 2008.[4]<p>Biology, Business administration and management, Communications, Computer science, Criminal justice, Elementary education, Marketing, Nursing, Psychology, Political science.<p>Of those, I'd say Nursing and the more sciencey fields like Biology, Computer science, Psychology, and maybe some Political science need math.  The others not so much.  Of course, out of these, Computer science is the most math-heavy.<p>Incidentally, according to this[5], Stanford's most popular major now is Computer Science.<p>So, that's a fair bit of math there.  Not as much as you'd need to major in engineering, applied math, or mathematics itself, of course.  But perhaps more than what's taught in most high schools.<p>Now, compare that to how many of these majors need art.  I would say none of them do.  And none of them are any kind of art major.  So, yes, I think math has a very strong lead over art as far as the most popular majors go.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.theu.com/admissions_ratings/rhode_island_school_of_design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theu.com/admissions_ratings/rhode_island_school_o...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juilliard_School#Admittance"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juilliard_School#Admittance</a><p>[3] - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_admissions_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_admissions_in_the_Unit...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/10/27/cb.what.major.pays/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/worklife/10/27/cb.what.major....</a><p>[5] - <a href=""http://mashable.com/2012/07/01/stanford-top-major-computer-science/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mashable.com/2012/07/01/stanford-top-major-computer-s...</a>",1362214660

Not necessarily in the part where you write the if, else, for and while stuff, but the part before that - when you're figuring out what you actually want to DO.<p>I've spent hours simply thinking about the best algorithm to use for a task. Sitting there with a notebook, sketching different possibilities over a simple example, thinking about its algorithmic complexity and whether there's a way to do it better. Considering what data structures I need to implement it, and the trade-offs between those choices. Whether I might just need to start over altogether (and I have; on some of the more challenging algorithm assignments, I've gone through 4 iterations of implementation before I hit one I was happy with).<p>You might call that engineering. But, the act of actually COMING UP with new algorithms and implementations that might solve the problem? That's creativity. And the harder the problem, the more it takes to solve.<p>Maybe it's just that I'm still a student, doing some projects on my own and doing a lot of homework assignments. I don't know what kind of coding you're doing, but if you can do it mechanically, without requiring any creativity whatsoever, then it doesn't sound like a very good use of your time.",1362214319

Replace ""drone"" with ""telephoto lens"" and you'll still draw the ire of law enforcement if you go around taking pictures of children in their back yards.<p>More importantly, ""think of the children"" is a common justification for bad laws. Human minds tend to give too much weight to low-probability stories. Nobody freaks out about the thousands of children who die every year from car accidents, but if a technology has the potential to take pictures of children surreptitiously they call for bans.<p>Drones are just like cars: people are going to be harmed by them, but the benefits are almost certainly greater than the costs.

During the rest of the week we did festivals and events to gain business on the other days. It wasn't very much and unstable at best. We pivoted to catering as it was more sustainable as a business and one that we could grow much larger.

But the Holocaust is unprecedented in many ways.<p>Germany was a normal Western statethe Weimar Republic was in many ways at the forefront of liberalism and governance. It is unprecedented that by legal and popular politics, Germans created the political and lethal machinery to victimize so many other Germans.<p>The Holocaust was a civil war where innocents were murdered or forced into slavery.<p>Hitler was a fool. Germans were among the best educated in the world, but Hitler personally was without precedent Europe's worst governor. Nevermind the betrayal of his own people; his economy relied unsustainably on slavery, his theories were bunk, his cowardice was monumental... He benefited from the long-term gains of the Weimar Republic's governance while simultaneously killing or exiling Germany's greatest asset, its intellectuals.<p>The Holocaust was a vehicle of this, Hitler's personal madness, unlike any other genocide.<p>Collaboration, most of all, defines the Holocaust. Hitler found collaborators throughout the whole world, from Japan to Moscow. The Soviet Union, itself the most victimized by the war, was for five years allied with Germany. There were Poles who eagerly betrayed their neighbors. Hungarian fascists were condemning civilians to death not months before the end of the war. The French collaborated in the Holocaust. It is unprecedented that anti-Semitism was so pervasive as to infect all of Europe.<p>The Holocaust showed that Western civilization, not just Hitler's Germany, was eager to execute unprecedented crimes against humanity.<p>These are but a few ways the Holocaust is distinct from other genocides, from the experience of American slavery, from even North Korean concentration camps and Soviet gulags.

Write it down.  I got us some paper and everything was smooth from there.  I got them a room, a deal, and told them where the best place to catch some romance in the city was.<p>The writer's reaction and feelings toward the interaction mirrored my own quite well.

You need to accept the fact that for whatever reason, people choose to label you as a foreigner because you cook ethnic food, so you lose branding credibility. Therefore, you need to outsource your branding. You can leverage your distribution channels to increase distribution and build your brand simultaneously. Your distribution channels are a) your restaurant, and b) a catering business. Why not sell your food to other catering companies? There is no reason for it to be exclusive to your own. When more catering companies sell your food, you control more distribution channels and move more product. Your product is your food, and that is what differentiates you.<p>Reduce the cost of preparing your food [1] and outsource distribution. Allow catering businesses to serve your food. Tell them you will give them a discount if they call it ""<Your Last Name> Food.""
