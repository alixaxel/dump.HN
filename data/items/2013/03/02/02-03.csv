He got this by comparing a -O0 run with a -02 run and then dividing, but the obvious problem with this is that even if a modern compiler is run with -O0 it's probably going to be in effect optimizing a lot just by all the architectural choices and default code generation. It would be interesting to see if one could take a more recent C compiler, say late '70s and compare it to a heavily optimizing GCC run, and answer the question: how much have C compilers improved over the last 30-40 years?",1362192624

So imagine you were buying key word ""y"" for ""$x""/click - Google comes along and competes, now their product is at the top of the organic results and you will need to pay (1000 x ""$X"") for the same advertising - oh by the way when they pays (1000 x ""$x"") for the same ad space that money just goes back to its own pocket.<p>So do not feel to bad - the FTC spent millions investigating Google to find said evidence and ultimately allowed Google to settle for $22.5 million, Google allowing others to use the Motorola patents is acquired, and changing their AdWords API. And keeping with their motto: ""Don't be evil"" it appears in the last 24 hours media has gone wild alleging Google spent $25,000 to honor the FTC Director during the investigation - I know when I am being investigated for federal anti-trust allegations I too like to honor the investigator, and like Google I do not give the investigator the money directly, I give it to a 3rd party who in turn gives it to the investigators office, this allows the investigator time to close the case before allegations are made and when allegations are eventually made it allows the investigator the opportunity to say at the time it was unknown who ""donated"" money for the honorarium.",1362191550
