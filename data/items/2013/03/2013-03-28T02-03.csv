The editor component took a full 10 to 15 seconds to load into the page every time.  So I said ""that editor sucks"".  It was one of the few things I had said during the meeting.<p>The manager was very irritated and said something like ""We don't tolerate that kind of negativity here"".  And continued, as if I had said something awful.  He said something like ""unless you have a solution to a problem"" something something in the process of explaining why I shouldn't say that.<p>So five minutes after the meeting I found out how to disable the slow graphical editor and then the issue tracker became usable for normal people.<p>Well, I guess I am a negative person then.  If it sucks, it sucks.<p>I will try to take some of this advice constructively though, because I do spend a lot of time focusing on problems that need to be solved.  But I can't help but think that the reason a lot of people aren't so critical or 'negative' is that they have just given up on fixing things, or are just so generally ineffective at problem solving that they naturally accept everything as it is.<p>I would rather be a negative bastard who identifies and solves problems than a happy ineffectual drone who just goes along to get along and accepts the status quo no matter how broken.",1364438997

5453136,comment,5449105,5452830,3,0,jrochkind1,,,"nope, I think that rails session sounds probably like ASP.net session. At any rate, rails session is like PHP session (i am not familar with asp.net).<p>But yes, the default Rails implementation does not store the session on the server but a key in a cookie. Although you can optionally do that, storing the actual session data in the rdbms, or other server-side places. But the default Rails implementation, yes, actually stores the session info itself in cookies.<p>One of the benefits of this is, when you've scaled out/load balanced your app servers to multiple instances, they don't need to share a session store somewhere, they each get the entire session via cookie. There are also other disadvantages, including with synchronization.<p>But also including that your session data is now visible to the client when it wasn't before. So, yeah, encrypting the data is one way to change the trade-off calcuation and make it work for more (but not all) apps/use cases, why not?<p>It actually doesn't increase the complexity much. If you're storing session data in cookies to begin with, you already needed to crypto sign them, to avoid tampering. If you're involving crypto in there anyway, and a secret key anyway, might as well (as a configurable option, sure; which is the default configuration, why not) tell the crypto library to encrypt+sign/decrypt+verify instead of just sign/verify, why not.",1364438787

Numpy/Scipy (and previously, numarry and NumPy) are, at least to scientists, some of the most useful libraries in Python.  Being able to express computation in a high level language, and having it run in native code, yet still be able to access the data in python, is often a major productivity enhancer.<p>I'm still a bit skeptical Blaze will catch on.  It's ambitious, and the python numeric community has had to chase each new implementation (with serious issues with backwards compatibility and cost of adoption) over the years.

It's great that you're taking steps to overcome negativity you've seen in yourself.<p>Did you notice, however, that the only explanations you went to for these negative approaches were ""dealing with people not as logical as us"" and ""genetic personality defect""? What's the common thread in these answers? They're both examples of blame externalization (and thus perserving cognitive dissonance - you're great the way you are!). If it's other people, you're not in the wrong, you don't need to change. If it's genetic, then it's hard-coded, and try as you might, you're going to have a hell of a time fixing it.<p>Now maybe you're right, and maybe you're wrong. Who am I to say? Your points aren't invalid, just biased, and it's clear to see where it's coming from.
