In <i>Salt: A World History</i>, Mark Kurlansky presents a theory that the Basques preserved their ancient and linguistically disconnected culture by bartering salt-preserved fish gained from the vast stocks on the Atlantic coast as protein stocks to neighbouring peoples during the European winters. Evidence of such tools may lend some further support to this theory.<p>(Edit: I just noticed he has also written <i>The Basque History of the World: The Story of a Nation</i>... that's definitely on my list now!)",1362721981

5342250,comment,5328324,5342117,1,0,javert,,,"Anarcho-capitalism is not the consequence of the rest of Objectivism, so that's the specific flaw in your reasoning. (Sorry to be blunt here, it's just easier.)<p>The letter you linked to is erroneous because, contra what it says, forming a ""competing government"" is an initiation of force. It is retaliatary force for the actual government to act to stop a ""competing government.""<p>(The next two paragraphs are kind of a tangent, the actual philosophical response to your mistake is after that.)<p>I don't think this is an interesting issue, though. Rand's philosophy is hierarchical: metaphysics, then epistemology, then morality, then politics. Derivative issues in politics are largely ""implementation defined."" For example, I don't think you can have a government without any taxes at all in today's world, whereas Rand thought no taxes would be the ideal thing to aim for. That issue doesn't have any bearing on whether Objectivism is correct or not.<p>As another example, I also don't care about who builds the roads, and stuff like that. If we had non-governmental roads from the start, we'd probably all live in private cities, and the world would be vastly different, but we're stuck with what we have, so who cares?<p>Let me change direction and go to a likely source of your error. Let me give an example. Honesty is an Objectivist virtue, so some people think you have to be honest all the time. That's not true: There is a certain context in which honesty is applicable. You don't have to be honest to a robber asking where your kids are. Likewise, non-initiation of force only applies under a system of laws and government. It's a political principle. It would not apply to people stranded on a desert island. It does not apply to a state of nature. It doesn't apply to people seeking to initially form a government. It also doesn't apply when the government is bad, past a certain ""implementation defined"" point (i.e., Objectivism doesn't have a specific principle for where that line is - it's too situational).<p>So, it's an error of context to say that the non-aggression is some universal moral rule that implies that we all have to have anarcho-capitalism. It's not a moral rule, it's a political rule. It's part of the next level up.<p>This is true in the same way (more or less) that honesty is not a universal moral rule. Understanding the context for honesty requires understanding the actual more fundamental principle it derives from, which is to always act in a way that serves your own life and happiness. (Which, itself, even has a context that depends on hierarchically previous ideas - Rand was not against suicide in the case of losing a precious loved one, for example, if you can't conceive of living happily without that person.)<p>> Rand's (and your) reading of Kant is significantly flawed.<p>I don't claim that I can provide evidence for the things I say about Kant, because that evidence presupposes agreement on fundamentals of Objectivism, and that's not something I can provide evidence for either, other than pointing to reality and suggesting someone undertake a multi-year study of the Objectivist literature. So, the stuff about Kant is just intended as a ""sampler,"" something to get someone thinking and maybe intrigued.<p>Putting the Kant stuff aside, I'd be genuinely interested to see what your reaction (again) to what I've said.<p>(Two more tangential paragraphs follow.)<p>By the way, normal people do not have the epistemological background to _not_ make errors that have to do with disassociating abstractions (concepts, principles) from the concretes they refer to. Ayn Rand calls that ""rationalism,"" and I think that's the category in which your mistake falls. Many normal people (especially those drawn to programming) habitually think this way. That's how I was for most of my life, and the only thing that kept drawing me back to Objectivism was honestly realizing that nothing else made sense, and knowing that there was more background to Objectivism that I still lacked.<p>Most people who aren't rationalistic people just don't trust abstractions _at all_. For example, pragmatists who say that there are no rules, or people who say that no knowledge is really trustworthy. This is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.",1362721899
5342249,comment,5339342,5342211,2,0,pasbesoin,,,"I think some of the argument against this, is (per those making it, and I find myself in some agreement) that <i>you</i> are locked (obligated) <i>to the contract</i>, regardless of what you do to the phone.<p>One use case for unlock-at-will (or no lock) proponents:  The user is in the U.S. and has a GSM phone.  The user travels to Europe.  Roaming rates on that GSM phone are very expensive.  If the phone is unlocked, the user can purchase a European SIM and take advantage of local, European rates (probably using a ""preloaded""/""reloadable"" cash-balance SIM).<p>The user is still paying his US$60/month or whatever on his home contract.  S/he is merely avoiding high roaming rates while traveling, without having to purchase a ""disposable"" phone that 1) Probably has less capable physical specifications and does not have any of the user's data; 2) Is more likely to be discarded and become a disposal problem / waste at the end of the trip.<p>Unlocking is not just or primarily about post-contract use, nor is it about escaping a contract without compensating the provider for the unpaid portion of their subsidy.  It's about being able to use the phone the way <i>you</i> want, once and as the obligations one has committed to have been met.<p>And... it potentially helps the waste stream / disposal problem, by allowing the transfer of older devices to other parties who may be happy to use them, effectively extending their useful lifetime while avoiding now unnecessary production of additional units.",1362721791

I think this is the correct way to do DRM in that it works and does not require locked down client platforms or invasive rootkits.<p>I would much prefer to pay for something as a service than have some third party try and take control of my computer. After all, people don't complain about 37 signals , google or World of warcraft for their business models which essentially amount to the same sort of ""DRM"".<p>The issues here seem to be that:<p>EA didn't plan for the demand and make sure that enough servers were available.<p>Since there is no monthly service fee, there will come a point at which it is no longer economical for EA to run the servers. This will make the game unplayable unless there is some plan by which they will release the server software for download after X years.<p>There are certain expectations built around the SimCity brand, mainly that the games have high and timeless replayability and that they can be played in isolation. I wonder if the game had been named ""Simcity online"" would have changed the reception?",1362720323
