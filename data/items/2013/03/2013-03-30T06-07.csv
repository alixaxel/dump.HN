Playing any type of guitar does not limit you to a specific style of play - you can play any style you want on any type of guitar. Some advanced techniques and progressions (i.e, solos or conversly fingerstyle) will be more comfortable on specific guitar types, but there's no technical limitation from playing anything on every guitar type. Those distinctions are mostly meaningless to beginners who will be mostly playing simple chords and melodies (to which I would say, a classical guitar is the most comfortable form factor).",1364626759

HN includes the far less enjoyable tasks of occasionally down-voting and
flagging.<p>I know HN employs an ""excessive flagging"" threshold to prevent abusive
flagging (pg mentioned this eons ago, but I can't find the link). The
""Enough rope to hang yourself"" design works well with engaged users who
care about the quality of HN, but the design seems to break down when
there's too much bad stuff to flag/down-vote. The most obvious break
down is when emotions run high on some topic, and we're flooded with bad
comments, throw-away trolling accounts, and redundant but up-voted
submissions. But on everyday terms, if I was to flag every single
violation of the site guidelines I see in the /newest queue, I'd very
quickly hang myself on the anti-abuse code.<p>Even seemingly well-intentioned people get hung by the anti-abuse code:<p>https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5454106<p>Too much of a good thing is often bad, and a well-intentioned person
with an itchy mouse finger could easily flag too much. At present,
there's just no way to know where the ""too much"" line is, or what kind
of infractions should be flagged.<p>pg, could you provide more guidance on what you want to be flagged?<p>I've got a few ideas for potential ways to provide feedback on good/bad
flags to users in their profiles without spoiling the anti-abuse code. I
could either email them to you or post them up in the ""Feature Request""
thread where they belong.<p>p.s. Also could you please add ""gossip"" and ""X is down"" messages to the

5464643,comment,5464311,5464553,5,0,dombili,,,"I don't know much about this class, so I can't really say what's the difference between this class and watching a video on YouTube, but I took a couple of courses on Coursera and I have to say, there's a big difference (generally speaking). I'm not an MOOC expert, but some differences that I've noticed from my experiences:<p>- You can engage with people who want to learn the same thing as you do via discussion forums. Those people are basically your class mates. You have the same teacher, same assignments, you get to watch the same lectures etc. If you have a question you'd like to ask, you get to ask those questions to your class mates and you can have discussions on that very subject. Sometimes teachers get involved too and if they don't, you can ask them to get involved.<p>- Teachers provide course materials. Some of them are transcripts of video lectures but some of them contain some really good information that you probably can't find anywhere else, because they're mostly written by your teacher specifically for that class.<p>- Sense of accomplishment. Now this may differ from person to person, but it's nice to get some acknowledgment once you finish your course.<p>- Quizzes. You actually get to test your knowledge. If the course requires an assignment for you to finish the course, that's even better. For example, you take a class on International Law, you may be required to write an essay on the subject with X amount of word limit. They give you a hard deadline and that becomes your homework. You actually feel like you're a student. Plus, teachers actually read what you've written and some of them even give notes.<p>- You can get verified certificate, but I believe they announced that fairly early and I'm not exactly sure how that works. But seems self-explanatory.<p>- And the best thing is, I get to have all these things for free. I'm thousands of miles away from the US or the UK, but I can still take classes from Princeton University or University of Edinburgh, and that's just so cool. I realize the quality of education is not the same as taking an actual class by attending the school, but who cares? You watch the same lectures from the same professors (most of the time) and it's for free, in the comfort of my home and at my own convenience.",1364624345

The 3% chance doesn't mean that all applicants have a 3% chance.  It means that 3% of applicants have a really great chance and 97% have no chance.

Nonetheless, the statistic is highly misleading and the entire college process is becoming increasingly arbitrary. With so many talented candidates, it is often simply a crapshoot for all but the very best applicants.<p>Admission to an individual school in particular is extremely difficult to predict. I have friends who were just accepted to Harvard and rejected from Stanford, vice versa, accepted to Yale and neither Harvard nor Stanford, etc. It's similar to an earlier discussion today here on HN about the applicability of group statistics to an individual situation: even if you're an exceedingly qualified applicant, your essays just might not click with a particular school's screener. Or perhaps you're not fully qualified, but someone in the admissions committee really connects with your personal story. These kinds of things happen all of the time in college admissions; with such a competitive pool, getting into any particular school often comes down to chance.<p>As for the acceptance rate itself, it's as much a measure of how good a school is at marketing as it is of its competitiveness. Harvard (and many others) sends pamphlets by the thousands trying to bait almost-certainly-hopeless students into sending an application, just to drive down their acceptance percentage. Many schools also reject candidates that are ""too good,"" (""Tufts syndrome"") because an admissions office will gamble that such candidates will matriculate at a better school. They would prefer to get their acceptance percentage lower than accept a student who probably wouldn't matriculate.",1364624215
