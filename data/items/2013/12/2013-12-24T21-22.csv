I&#x27;d like to see some empirical data about things like poverty levels, life expectancy, job security, bankruptcy, and so on.<p>Keep in mind that this is only a couple of decades (at most) from the Great Depression. Even if the 1950s were clearly better, it&#x27;s a rather cherry-picked data point considering how much worse the 1930s clearly were.<p>That being said, I&#x27;m not too excited about the intangibles of the 1950s. The Korean War was in the 1950s and Jim Crow was in full swing. Life expectancy was much lower. Just about any consumer good from today is clearly superior to the 1950s equivalent.",1387922325

I now can put together web apps or APIs in hours vs days and integrate it with about anything out there from other APIs, using gems wrapping them or other gems for integration like redis, rabbitmq etc you name it. I have never ran into issues of incompatible gems I could not fix myself in a short period of time. It&#x27;s incredible productive and reasonable fast. I am dealing with data reads/writes in the ten thousands of records per second and when something smells like bottleneck you still can throw in a native extension or use jruby and call java libs. If you are building all you do with boilerplate activerecord or other ORMS you just don&#x27;t use it right. Flexibly is key. I think every challenge has it&#x27;s best tools. I tried grails, play, spring mvc and other frameworks but promise that I can beat every of these frameworks in terms of development speed. Ruby is far from being dead and has a huge community. Having that said its always good to also stay up to date with other tools.

6961260,comment,6960947,6961088,26,0,tptacek,,,"Two things.<p>First, while &quot;playing around with cryptography&quot; may be the only way to learn it, <i>building</i> cryptographic systems is just about the worst way to learn. Professional cryptographers start by cryptanalyzing targets and use that experience to inform their future designs. On the other hand, veteran implementors who have never taken the time to learn how to break crypto turn out protocols and designs that are repeatedly broken. You can see that right now with TLS and the TLS working group, which still hasn&#x27;t fixed MtE block ciphersuites because veteran implementors can&#x27;t get it through their heads that MtE is a design flaw.<p>Don&#x27;t learn by building. You need to learn by breaking.<p>Second, more than one project has done the tightrope walk of telling their users &quot;this isn&#x27;t really safe&quot; but then misleading (innocently or not) non-savvy users into trusting them. One project made it clear that their system wasn&#x27;t &quot;ready&quot; to defend against nation-state adversaries... but then suggested that maybe it would be good enough for journalists, and even promoted it at an event for teaching journalists cryptography. It was later comically broken.<p>Be honest with yourself. Crypto doesn&#x27;t get beta-tested into resiliency. Strong systems start out strong. If you&#x27;re building something because its your dream to thwart the NSA, don&#x27;t kid yourself into thinking that you&#x27;ll get there by first protecting people&#x27;s Warcraft clans.",1387921839

I&#x27;ve done this for almost 30 years and, with the exception of the times I was forced into management roles, I&#x27;ve loved engineering.<p>The key is that you have to be doing something your employer feels provides value, and ultimately you want to tailor the work towards something you&#x27;re enthusiastic about.  For me, I try to determine which up-and-coming technologies are worth including in future products.  This means I get to play with lots of cool (and sometimes not so cool) technologies - and when my employer asks how something should be done, they &quot;redeem&quot; that knowledge with a list of concrete pros and cons.<p>Even the author&#x27;s examples were projects that he was passionate about before he started the unicorn job.  One point I definitely agree with is that you have to be a good communicator to first convince your boss you can provide value, and again to deliver that value.<p>I&#x27;ll also agree that it might be easier to find a unicorn job in a university setting where things aren&#x27;t quite so structured.

6961240,comment,6959843,6960799,8,0,dba7dba,,,">> I filed an online police report with San Jose police, where Frys is based.<p>You can forget about police doing anything to catch the criminals. The only good you get out of contacting police of such ID theft cases is that you can use the resulting paperwork to file claim with credit card company. Forget about police doing anything to actually go out to look for the criminals.<p>IMO, US police departments are firmly stuck in the mode of &#x27;only-criminal-we-go-after-is-someone-with-a-gun-or-drug&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s been a while so the sequence of events is a bit fuzzy but basically I was a victim of ID theft a few years ago. A few checking/credit accounts opened using my name. 2 iPhones purchased using my name (not approved by me of course) at an official phone company store (meaning they were captured on security camera in the store). On Credit Report I pulled immediately after I learned what was happening, I saw my actual addresses and the criminals&#x27; addresses on the report. Interestingly the criminals were living in a &#x27;dump&#x27; 1 year earlier but had since moved into a rental in a brand new condo complex. I mean a brand new, nice condo complex, also in San Jose area. I found out through Google Street View.<p>Now I had leads on their addresses and VIDEO FOOTAGE (in possession of the phone store in San Jose) of them existed. I was excited as I was headed to police station to file report. Well, what a disappointment. It seemed no one seemed interested in seeing the video footage. They just took my report (took me about 1+ hours in there). I got a generic confirmation letter from my police dept weeks later. I heard nothing from the police in San Jose. Weeks (or months later ?) I got a call from a US Postal Inspection Service investigator. He gave me names of 2 suspects and asked again if I knew them. I did not and am pretty sure they were the criminals. Thus the crime was being investigated by US Postal Inspection Service. So a potentially slam dunk case was being pushed around between 2 local police departments and a Federal agency. And the result was I was actually interviewed on the phone weeks/months after the crimes had occurred.<p>These pulps committed a crime that potentially cost someone else a few thousands bucks (cost of phone and fee and late fee), not to mention hours I had to spend to clean up the mess. But because the victim and criminals are in separate/distant jurisdictions, the police essentially did not do much on their own. They simply pushed the case off to a federal agency.<p>Had someone in my police department called San Jose police department to go look at a video foorage at a phone store and visit a local address up there, they could&#x27;ve caught the guys in a matter of hours or days.<p>Interestinly, months later I got a letter from landlord of the condo rental the criminals had rented. The landlord was demanding unpaid rent. The pulps had rented the complex using my name and when the fraudulent accounts were cut off and their money dried up, they fled without paying rent. The landlord&#x27;s collector of course searched for my name and found the real &#x27;me&#x27;.<p>The US police seems helpless with these crimes that cross multiple jurisdictions.",1387921566

They&#x27;re not paying Ireland taxes where they claim the sales are to do a Double Irish. They&#x27;re not paying Holland taxes where they route the money through to do the Dutch Sandwich. They&#x27;re not paying the US taxes, they park the money in an offshore account and lobby congress to grant a tax asylum.<p>I know that, and that is a problem.  But even if they stopped doing that, Italy could easily see none of the taxes on profit.  Italy&#x27;s new law doesn&#x27;t actually fix the underlying problem.  Instead it&#x27;s a tariff that somewhat works around the problem but also bans an entire category of inter-country trade, which is quite problematic.<p>Maybe I wasn&#x27;t clear enough when I used a hypothetical situation to illustrate why Italy&#x27;s law is attacking the wrong thing.<p>Italy&#x27;s law blocks a German corporation from selling German-served ads on German servers to Italian customers.
