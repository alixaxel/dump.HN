I don&#x27;t doubt that it works, but I wonder why.<p>To me, it&#x27;s totally irrational. By virtue of being included on an index, a stock spikes in trading volume as all the index funds/ETFs adjust to include it; vice versa if it ever gets removed. These transactions aren&#x27;t free, in fact the simultaneous dumping/buying of the affected stock serves to drive the price further in the favor of sellers or buyers (i.e, not you). And <i>none</i> of that money is coming from rational investors, it&#x27;s coming from people with no understanding of the stock market blindly parking their money in index investments, which then blindly spew it across a bunch of blue-chip stocks.<p>So it seems to me like any stock that&#x27;s part of an index/benchmark is being inflated by index funds. But as long as people buy into the idea of index investing as smart investing, there&#x27;s no way to bet against it.<p>Sounds vaguely bubbly to me.",1385974648

In one scala system I worked on we had a master/slave postgres db system. We were replacing a legacy RoR system with a Scala system, and in the RoR system there were all sorts of data inconsistency errors caused by people writing to master and reading from the slaves before replication occurred.<p>In the Scala system which replaced it, we set up a monadic action system. A function which hit the database would have a type signature either PReader[T] or PWriter[T] - this was the only way to access a java.sql.Connection short of manually calling jdbc. Combining the two forms yields a PWriter:<p><pre><code>    for {\n      _ <- putObjectToDB(args)\n      obj <- getObjectFromDB(args)\n    yield (render(obj)) // is a PWriter[_]\n</code></pre>\nThe whole operation runs in a single transaction against the correct database, and any attempt to do the wrong thing is a compile error.",1385974580

Scalaz 7 removes a lot of the less-readable operators (e.g. you now have to write &quot;Kleisli&quot; rather than &quot;☆&quot;). The Requests HTTP library, long mocked for its periodic table of operators, has fallen out of favour (I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s even maintained any more).<p>I can&#x27;t speak for SBT because I don&#x27;t use it, but Spray is probably the nicest library for defining HTTP APIs I&#x27;ve ever used, in any language. As for type inference, yes it&#x27;s imperfect, and maybe disappointing for someone used to Haskell, but coming from Python I found the set of type annotations I needed to add to make my Scala compile was a subset of the ones I wanted to document anyway.",1385974391

I think that when you do your research on interesting companies, some companies light up, and then you should start investing in those companies as long as the light is up. If it goes out, then you should start selling the stock. To compensate against the market noise, you should buy in smaller chunks and spread the purchases over a longer period of time: this way you don&#x27;t need to care as much as about the dips and spikes.",1385973576

We regularly engage in what is arguably the most dangerous activity on the planet without batting an eye or thinking we should clamp down on the number of barely-trained 16-yo&#x27;s doing it, so I&#x27;m not going to be moved by the safety concerns on this one. If for no other reason than drones are expensive, and lawsuits more so, so you can expect a pretty good safety record<p>2) &quot;Noise/environment concerns&quot; - I was working in the SF Bay Area when 9/11 happened; it was weird to suddenly not have planes constantly taking off from 3 different airports. For a few days.<p>It will be strange to have this things buzzing around the sky - for a few months. Then you&#x27;ll stop looking up. I can&#x27;t imaging them being worse than a leaf blower or a big diesel delivery truck.<p>3) &quot;Airspace/regulations&quot; - this part is fascinating to me. How do you avoid children&#x27;s kites? Rival delivery drones? BB-guns? (I know that&#x27;s what I&#x27;d be doing - a lucky shot to a rotor, and I&#x27;m the Hero Slayer of the 6th Grade). It is - literally (now that &quot;literally&quot; means anything you want it to, I can use it without fear) - a new frontier, with the same types of questions we&#x27;re asking about Moon and Asteroid rights. I&#x27;m psyched we have these types of technical questions to deal with now.<p>4) &quot;Surveillance/terrorists/et al&quot; - whatever your concern - too late.<p>Start this post thinking to just think about & list my response to each major point raised elsewhere; looks like I&#x27;ve come out pretty keen on this whole thing.

6832502,comment,6831930,6831930,15,0,bane,,,"Ultra-intelligence reminds me of a conversation I had with friends years ago about super humanity -- probably after a night of drinking and too much sci-fi about genetically engineered superior humans.<p>We decided that a person capable of at least 10% above human maximum (or human average, I can&#x27;t really remember) in at least two or three areas or 25% in one would count as &quot;Super human&quot;. This excludes most hyper-specializers like Olympic Sprinters, or professional chess players.<p>Here&#x27;s a fun video of the kind of deltas we were thinking of with professional American football players <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8tYqT9GDd8\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8tYqT9GDd8</a><p>10% isn&#x27;t all that much, but we felt like a person who could run an under 9 second 100 meter <i>and</i> had an Eidetic memory for example, would qualify as a classic super human.<p>But IQ, IQ was hard. We couldn&#x27;t decide about IQ. IQ is normalized at 100, fussy to test, and has questionable meaning. But suspending all those questions for a bit, given an &quot;average&quot; IQ of 100, a 10% or even 25% delta isn&#x27;t really all that impressive at 110 or 125, not even Mensa levels. But let&#x27;s take the top .1% of IQ, around 145, a 10% increase there is about 160 and a 25% increase is just north of 180 and now we&#x27;re talking. Kim Ung-yong definitely qualifies as a single ability super human.<p>Somebody with an IQ >160 should qualify for certain. After all a 60 point delta from mean the other way leaves you with an IQ of 40 and we&#x27;re talking about pretty severe disability.<p>So somebody who could run a sub-9 second 100 meter and had an IQ of say...170 would be super human by this completely arbitrary thinking.<p>In the comics, people with these kinds of abilities, even as limited as this definition suggests, wear oddball costumes with the underwear on the outside and capes and either try to take over the world or try to save it.<p>But in the real world, what people with abilities even close to these kinds of metrics end up doing is decidedly banal and often somewhat narcissistic.<p>Fast runners just...run fast against other fast runners...they don&#x27;t generally patrol cities and run down purse snatchers like the flash. Heavy lifters see who can lift the heaviest thing, they don&#x27;t generally crack open burning buildings and fight thugs saving orphans like the Thing. People with both talents get organized into groups and end up seeing who can move a ball towards one end of a field over another. The really clever ones will parlay their fame into side businesses and open a burger restaurant or a theme bar or a line of sports oriented active wear.<p>These folks aren&#x27;t curing cancer, or stopping Fascism, or ending poverty, or worse, even trying to take over a moderate sized piece of real-estate and become Emperor of the Bronx or something.<p>For the super smart, there&#x27;s definitely work for them to do, but it&#x27;s pretty limited stuff and you really have to like physics or math to do it. And let&#x27;s be honest, Mensa and Mega aren&#x27;t exactly wowing the world with a prolific output of revolutionary world changing ideas.<p>I think partially because it&#x27;s hard to go off and do the kinds of fantastic exceptional things that the general populace thinks you <i>could</i> do if you were super powered. Running a little bit faster still doesn&#x27;t absolve you vigilante laws, but it can get you a Gold medal and some cereal advertising deals. Being ultra-smart doesn&#x27;t mean you don&#x27;t have to deal with averagely smart people to get anything more complex than tinkering done. Nobody so far is so smart than they can hack their way through the rest of dim-witted humanity like Ozymandias from the Watchmen.<p>History has shown that people with exceptional intelligence (at least as measured by IQ) also go on to do rather hum-drum things.<p>- Marilyn vos Savant writes a 2 inch high weekly column where she gives advice and helps people solve Supermarket brain teasers and Freshman probability problems.<p>- Scott Adams created a mildly observant comic strip about working in a professional office environment<p>- Asia Carrera made a career of getting filmed while having sex and playing videogames<p>- and on and on, a look at some lists of known ultra-IQ folks shows a list of comedians, some more porn actresses and models, actors, some pro-wrestlers, a bunch of fiction writers etc.<p>There&#x27;s very, painfully, few people who occupied their time with something that really moved humanity up a notch and even most of those are debatable.<p>Hell, HN is full of people who I&#x27;d guess are in the 90+ percentile and most of what we do here is pontificate and build chat apps so people can share pictures of their cats.",1385973100

If you want to build your brand, you need the .com, because branding must agree with consensus, which is that powerful brands own the .com. I argue this is common fact.<p>So if you are not buying the .com, you are choosing not to build the AppointmentReminder brand. Why? Surely, more markets exist for you to sell to. The recognizability of a brand bridges market segments. Since every market segment communicates in its own language (because of varying contexts), they need standard identifiers of solutions to problems, which a brand provides. With a solid brand, you control a channel of communication between markets. Thus, you naturally expose the company to new markets.<p>There is nothing stopping you from growing AppointmentReminder 10x, at least. The markets exist for you to capture.

From [1]<p>> Deflation started in the early 1990s. The Bank of Japan and the government tried to eliminate it by reducing interest rates and &#x27;quantitative easing&#x27;, but did not create a sustained increase in broad money and deflation persisted. In July 2006, the zero-rate policy was ended.<p>So wait...the government was trying to get rid of deflation, but you claimed they were the ones causing it? WTF?<p>Reasons<p>* Tight monetary conditions. The Bank of Japan kept monetary policy loose only when inflation was below zero, tightening whenever deflation ends.<p>* Unfavorable demographics. Japan has an aging population (22.6% over age 65) that is not growing and will soon start a long decline. The Japanese death rate recently exceeded its birth rate.<p>* Fallen asset prices. In the case of Japan asset price deflation was a mean reversion or correction back to the price level that prevailed before the asset bubble.<p>* Insolvent companies:  Banks lent to companies and individuals that invested in real estate. When real estate values dropped, these loans could not be paid.<p>* Fear of insolvent banks:  Japanese people are afraid that banks will collapse so they prefer to buy (United States or Japanese) Treasury bonds instead of saving their money in a bank account.<p>* Imported deflation: Japan imports Chinese and other countries&#x27; inexpensive consumable goods (due to lower wages and fast growth in those countries) and inexpensive raw materials<p>Here is the only point (an explicitly libercrazian one) that supports your position:<p>* Stimulus Spending: According to both Austrian and Monetarist economic theory, Keynesian &#x27;stimulus&#x27; spending actually has a depressing effect.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation#In_Japan\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflation#In_Japan</a>",1385971713
