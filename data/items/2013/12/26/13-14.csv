Micro-benchmarks don&#x27;t predict large application performance very well. I don&#x27;t like micro-benchmarks.<p>A micro-benchmark suite is better than a few micro-benchmarks, but really I would like a suite of real-world micro-applications.<p>I&#x27;m willing to add more benchmarks so it&#x27;s not just Rails, but I simply don&#x27;t know what to add.",1388066394

Emacs isnt just an editor with embedded lisp, its more a vm for bootstrapping editors. You could do an emacs with python, but the hard part is providing an environment where the extensions dont interfere with the user input loop, with buffer redisplay etc., while still staying easy to write. The emacs buffer-based async handling of external processes is a masterpiece of software engineering, much better than things like unix pipes.

6966172,comment,6965433,6965922,20,0,actsasbuffoon,,,"> Over the years I&#x27;ve learnt quite a few languages, and what strikes me is that they&#x27;re all so very alike.<p>I used to think this as well, then I learned some Prolog. For those who aren&#x27;t familiar with it, Prolog is a logic programming language (as opposed to imperative and functional languages). Instead of telling Prolog how to solve a problem, you give it a set of facts and tell it what you want to know. Prolog takes care of the rest, without writing any conditionals, loops, etc. At least in theory; in my (small amount of) experience most non-trivial Prolog programs usually involve some imperative style code. Still, it&#x27;s wildly different and a lot of fun.<p>There&#x27;s also lambda calculus, which is crazy, and wonderful, and absurdly difficult, and one of the most joyous experiences I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s a language with nothing but functions applied to other functions. Even numbers are functions in lambda calculus, which has some fascinating implications. I wouldn&#x27;t want to build anything non-trivial in LC, but I&#x27;ve learned a lot about programming as a result of studying it.<p>Discovering how to create singly linked lists in LC using nothing but partially applied functions was a profound and emotional experience. I remember how hard I laughed when I noticed that LC&#x27;s false function is the same as the Church-encoded numeral for zero. These are things most other developers don&#x27;t think are funny because they have no idea what I&#x27;m talking about. I think a few of my co-workers suspect I should be institutionalized when I start talking about lambda calculus.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s also Haskell. A lot of lambda calculus is applicable to Haskell, which makes sense as Haskell descends from the ML family of languages, which in turn come from lambda calculus. Haskell doesn&#x27;t look or feel like most other languages, and it makes some decisions that seem really strange at first glance. Lazy evaluation, all functions are curried, no mutable state, all functions are pure, there are no variables, no exception handling... the language sounds almost unusable. Then you learn about monads and you realize that it&#x27;s trivial to add support for something that looks and feels like mutable state, except it&#x27;s a system of your own design. Imagine what would happen if you could change the way variable assignment works in your language of choice. For instance, software transactional memory was originally implemented in Haskell as a monad. They didn&#x27;t have to modify the language to add support. I can&#x27;t think of many other languages where that&#x27;s the case, and it&#x27;s a thing of beauty.<p>That&#x27;s a long and rambling way to say that lots of languages are really similar, but there are some wonderful languages that are extremely different. I highly recommend experimenting with them, but be aware that your friends and co-workers are unlikely to have any idea what you&#x27;re talking about. And on the off chance that they do understand, please let me know where you work. I want to work with you people.",1388064412

They&#x27;re a clan of assistants, surgeons, bio-engineers and self-improvers, they&#x27;re patched up because &quot;what goeth around cometh around&quot;[0], and with Igor it&#x27;s parts.

I think BB still feels heavy, the other services feel light.<p>I just think many people now use FB for what it was originally for. But, its now a little off putting becuase its clogged up with other features that other sites just do better.",1388063066

In GHC&#x27;s source I&#x27;ve seen a couple of longer functions (say ~50 lines) that re-use names in let/bind &quot;statements&quot; to get around going from x  to x&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;; the &quot;x&quot; simply kept shadowing its previous value.",1388063059

The primitives already exist for convenience, and can be transformed by pure functions, or new ones can be defined using the FFI.<p>Your observation isn&#x27;t new, most Elm games&#x27; signal graphs have the same shape - a bunch of input signals merged into one, the &#x27;main&#x27; loop as a step state, and the drawing code.&#x27;<p>In particular, which kinds of Signal combinators do you feel are lacking?<p><a href=\"http://docs.elm-lang.org/library/Signal.elm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://docs.elm-lang.org/library/Signal.elm</a>",1388062966

6966126,comment,6965435,6965435,1,0,pawn,,,"Fun little game.  I have a few suggestions that would make it better, in my opinion.<p>1.  Include a &#x27;save&#x27; feature or save automatically when a person steps through a door or transitions from one screen to another.<p>2.  Maybe allow a person to adjust how much left/right movement happens to a degree in the options.  The guy seems a little &#x27;floaty&#x27; to me, and I had trouble not over-shooting my intended jumps.  Of course, a max would be needed pretty close to where he&#x27;s currently at, and a min would be needed that&#x27;s still enough to play the game.<p>3.  Allow it to support controllers and/or customize the controls.<p>4.  Make picking up items more forgiving.  It&#x27;s currently a little too picky, in my opinion.",1388062901
