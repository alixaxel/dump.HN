6974469,comment,6973545,6974310,17,0,SpacemanSpiff,,,"In a nutshell, we encountered two problems (which may or may not be prevalent with all Earthships)<p>1. Extreme temperature fluctuations. You&#x27;re essentially living inside a solar collector. In the fall, the sun would blaze in through the windows, and I know you&#x27;re supposed to have overhangs, shades and air vents and underground air circulation systems, all of which we used. The bottom line is you can&#x27;t cheat physics. Even with the shades closed, the house is receiving over 300k BTU/hr of solar heat. This is just too much for any reasonably sized cooling system to handle. My infrared thermometer measured surface temperatures in excess of 140 deg. F on surfaces near the windows. In the winter, the same windows would leak heat like a sieve. Here in Montana when it&#x27;s overcast, 10 deg. F, and the wind is blowing 30 mph the front of the house would barely reach 55 deg F. This was with the 30k BTU propane furnace going 100% duty cycle. I would work at my computer with long pants, a sweater, a blanket over my legs, and an electric heater blowing under the blanket :) The rear of the house is built into the hillside, so it would be warmer in the back, but you could never get the place past about about 65-68 in the winter no matter how much you tried. The sheer size of the front windows and lack of insulation again made the house design at odds with thermodynamics in my opinion.<p>For the sake of comparison, our place in the hangar has ~R30 walls to the hangar, and again about ~R25 walls to the outside. We have in-floor radiant heat provided by our geothermal heat pump. Earlier this month when it was -20 deg. F outside we were toasty warm at 74 (we have a newborn child in the house now). And we were using significantly less energy to heat than at the Earthship.<p>2. Mice. The house construction methods are inherently porous, and mice have infiltrated the entire structure. They live in the cavities the walls form (and the roof supports), along the utility raceways in the ceiling, under cabinets, everywhere. I surmise that the mice have tunneled through the back of the hillside, between the tires, and up into the hollow cavities which support the ceiling. They then use this space to move around the inside of the house structure to other areas. No amount of trapping poisoning, etc. has slowed the onslaught of mice into the house. If the only way to prevent mice from infiltrating your supposedly green house is to use concrete in its construction and set outdoor poison traps which potentially kill hundreds of mice and may harm animals which then consume the poisoned mice, is this really such a green alternative?<p>I&#x27;ve visited an Earthship being constructed in Big Sky Montana by Mike Reynolds this year. The design changes I&#x27;ve seen may partially address point 1, but as far as point 2 I&#x27;m not at all convinced that this new house will be any better. I admire his vision, and that he&#x27;s been able to take his ideas so far. From an engineering standpoint, even taking into account the ecological footprint of the structure, I&#x27;m not convinced that his approach is the best when you look at the whole picture.",1388220853

A woman walking around in public &quot;indecently clothed&quot; is a felony (though exceptions are provided for hotel guests and beach visitors).

I want to build a business, a profitable one, by not owing anyone anything. I want to be in control because I am passionate about the technology and the problem it solves.<p>What I can see from a macroeconomic point of view, is the previous generations grasp at innovative output by the younger generation. They are essentially declaring a &quot;piece of the action&quot; for something they see only as a money bet. For someone with a billion dollars, spraying six digits to several companies is not a big risk. Consider how much work that now needs to go in to satisfy their expectation-go big or go home. This is ultimately bad for the consumer choice and the economy. Much human capital and time is wasted when good services and useful product needs to get shelved because they didn&#x27;t struck a homerun with the investor etc within the time frame allocated.<p>I don&#x27;t want to be part of this mickey mouse game. I want to know what it takes to build a profitable business from nothing, because ultimately I&#x27;m not in it soley for the money, I want to actually solve problems that I think is worthy of solving, and I need to be able to do this at my pace.<p>Leverage from outside money is a double edge sword as all day traders know. It magnifies profit but it also magnifies loss. I see companies that just keep on getting money without ever thinking about positive net profit growth, and instead what the next idiot will think the company will make in the &quot;near future&quot;, however long that is. I simply do not see this working and neither did Warren Buffet during the dotcom bubble, the idea that share price today is reflected on by not cash earned today but what it could make tomorrow is insanity (la nouvelle économie ooh la la)<p>I too support bootstrapping vs. funding, I mainly feel that the intellectual value is being exploited by profit at all cost kamikaze capitalism, and I just wonder how the attitude will change when we see the likes of Facebook and Twitter collapse in the oncoming market correction, when the next investor comes along and starts to worry that they won&#x27;t be making net profit this year or the next or the next, and that it&#x27;s a giant pump and dump scheme, where the victims will once again be duped investors.",1388218846

If you just look at taxes on wages for someone making $250k per year, you will pay about 40% in obvious taxes in California. There are sales and other taxes on top of this and some additional regulatory taxes as well.<p>Since I have operated companies with substantial payrolls in California and therefore been privy to the cost details, I can say that the total outlay to various government authorities when a paycheck is cut can exceed the total value of the paycheck in California but not much beyond that; maybe 52% to government, 48% to the employee.<p>In summary, you will only approach 60% if you include all possible taxes on the income including the spending of said income, which does not happen often in practice. Even in California, the worst case is closer to 50% if you manage your income reasonably well.<p>This still adds up to a lot of money if you compare it to a state like Washington with similar software engineering wages and no income tax, since that adds up to tens of thousands of extra income.",1388218647
