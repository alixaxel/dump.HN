6976170,comment,6976095,6976095,25,0,natrius,,,"Ignore the flamebait headline. The distinction Krugman makes between positive and normative economics is a useful one.<p>On the positive side, I think Krugman and DeLong are overestimating the strength of the floor for the value of a dollar. Hyperinflation would make it impossible for the Federal Reserve to buy up enough dollars to stabilize the value of the currency. Sure, you can pay taxes with them, but the government collects taxes to buy things, and if people no longer have faith in the dollar, the government won&#x27;t be able to buy things with those tax dollars. There&#x27;s no floor on the value of Bitcoin, but there&#x27;s no floor on the value of the dollar either.<p>On the normative side, I don&#x27;t think one&#x27;s position on the utility of central banking matters when it comes to Bitcoin. If blockchain currencies are the future, central banking is over, and our society will have to figure out how to make the economy work with endemic deflation. I think central banking is useful, but I don&#x27;t see a future for it.",1388260741

Tech moves fast, programming requires constant learning and updating of ones skill-set. The ability (and desire) to self teach is far more useful than rote memorization in a classroom spoon-fed environment. Self-education is a skill just like any other that needs practice.

Real expresiveness is about what SICP calls &quot;means of abstraction&quot; and &quot;means of combination&quot;, not necessarily about having very nice syntax. In general I think those considerations would benefit from distinguishing a bit more between syntax and semantics. As another example, I have been doing Ruby professionally for almost 10 years now, and despite this I have to strongly disagree with the conclusion of this quotation:<p><i>Python is a beautiful, clean language. But the same restrictions that make it nice and clean mean that it’s hard to write beautiful, clean libraries. Ruby, on the other hand, is a complicated, ugly language. But that complexity allows you to write really clean, nice, easy-to-use libraries.</i><p>The Ruby metaprogramming magic makes for really nice syntax, which is what made me choose it over Python all those years ago, but it complicates understanding of what&#x27;s going on - as I matured as an engineer, maintained a codebase over several years, several times spend long hours debugging issues coming from metaprogramming pitfalls, I shift more and more to the Python approach of building APIs in the simplest possible way, as much as possible sticking to simple function calls and no really fancy metaprogramming just to get a cleaner syntax, e.g. compare Rails has_many :foo with Django&#x27;s models.ForeignKey(Foo) and the internal implementations of those. Same thing with using &quot;BDD&quot; testing frameworks like RSpec vs. traditional assert stuff, what is the nice syntax worth if tricky bugs hit you where you most want to avoid it, in tests. Libraries like RSpec might be &quot;nice&quot;, but they are certainly not &quot;easy-to-use&quot;, and I don&#x27;t think I would call them quite &quot;clean&quot;, if I look at their source code.<p>In other words, while clean syntax is luring, in the long run clean and simple semantics is what I think is really important.",1388259580

Many community colleges also have special or honors programs that impose some requirements on the students (such as a minimum course load of 12 credits/semester) but provide dedicated advising (some of you might not understand how important this is, but advisers can make or break your career path at some points, specially in community colleges) and also tuition waivers.<p>I followed a very similar path to McGee&#x27;s: went to a very large urban community college and got accepted to their honors program. I completed my first two years completely debt free, while getting a top notch education in the classes that I cared about (sciences mostly) and then transferred to a state university which is in the top 15 nationwide for my major. In all I saved around $30k for those two years. One of the downsides is that the quality of the education in community colleges varies wildly from one professor to another.

And for a book featuring a ton of history and on a topic (economics) that some people might find dry, it&#x27;s very accessible and reads more like a novel than a textbook. I churned through the whole thing in about 2 days, it was so engrossing.<p>Anyway, I only just read it last week, so it may be too early to call it a &quot;book that changed my life&quot;, but I can say that as soon as I finished it, I immediately started re-reading it, this time to take notes and jot down thoughts about some of the implications and actionable aspects of this thinking.  It definitely gets a +1 from me.<p>Outside of that, <i>The Discipline of Market Leaders</i> would probably be the other candidate.  I only discovered this one because it was referenced in a different book I was reading, but it&#x27;s turned out to be quite interesting.  The authors present a pretty strong case for a very specific approach to business strategy that resonates with me.<p>[1]: <a href""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=696484"" rel""nofollo"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6964841</a><p>[2]: <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_growth_theor"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_growth_theory</a><p>[3]: <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_syste"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_adaptive_system</a><p>[4]: <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_economic"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complexity_economics</a>",1388258775

Full disclosure: I have full scholarship; so no student loans at graduation.<p>So why should I do a PhD? It&#x27;s the no-sweat option.\n- For kicks. I love Pure Math; I like working hard on hard problems. Would lead to an academic or pure research career and the fun continues for my whole life.\n- For the social aspect. Work with similar minded, smart people at a good school.\n- For learning. Mathematics does drive our world; it would be great to learn the core-of-the-core in pure math, may be make a small original contribution and make the world a better place.<p>But what is the point of a PhD? Our world is in the grips of unethical politicians and even more unethical and ruthless business people. Sometimes I think, I am only 20; it&#x27;s OK to be confused. Often I am full of despair that there is so much misery in the world and no one cares. My first 20 years have been on the straight and narrow path of academic excellence; now I have to make a choice and I can&#x27;t see a good framework to make a decision.<p>I wish there were a simple way to do this, may be to follow someone I admire. But I admire no one; we are living in tumultuous times as governments, journalism, big-finance, big-business are being de-nuded. Our presidents, politicians, businessmen, dream makers -- there is no one to look up to.<p>Am I the only one feeling this? Are we going through mass re-evaluation of our morality and society? May be it&#x27;s a good thing then, for a young woman to be at the cusp of such change -- times of tumult are perfect opportunities for creative brains to come up with ways to change the world? But how do I choose the road in the fork?",1388258139

Move to Iceland, a member of the <i>European Economic Area</i>.<p>EU and US law doesn&#x27;t work the way they think it does.  For starters, FISC isn&#x27;t relevant law here.  But more importantly--simply relocating their servers to Iceland does nothing for them since <i>the company physically remains in Italy.</i><p>They (Clipperz) remain subject to Italian laws, meaning that they are still subject to Italian <i>subpoenas</i> and discovery requests.  Civil law countries like Italy don&#x27;t have the same evidentiary protections that the US has. Italian prosecutors can simply use their refusal to provide access to those servers against them in court.  (The same is generally true in the US for civil, i.e., tort, cases but not for criminal cases.)<p>However, since their servers are no longer hosted in the US or the EU, they&#x27;re no longer protected by US or EU laws! So congratulations, Clipperz! You&#x27;ve accomplished the double whammy of not improving your legal situation at home while simultaneously <i>increasing</i> the threat to your servers! Now the NSA, British Intelligence, and various other US and EU government agencies can <i>legally</i> hack your servers, and the data they recover can <i>legally</i> be used in any US or EU court even without a warrant and despite the illegal means by which the data was obtained. Congratulations!<p>Here&#x27;s a suggestion guys: next time, consult a lawyer.  You clearly need one.",1388257542

6975862,comment,6971025,6972662,1,0,yaddayadda,,,"> Those are good suggestions, but I&#x27;d mention that it&#x27;s much easier for me now to analyze my situation in retrospect, understand what happened and the mistakes I made, and turn it into a cohesive narrative. At the time I didn&#x27;t really understand why I was doing poorly or what the root causes were, so while I did seek &quot;support&quot; on a number of occasions, it didn&#x27;t help.<p>Sadly, this is likely to have been true no matter where you were (e.g., college or workplace).  In my experience, in an academic environment simply expressing that there is something wrong and seeking a little bit of help will frequently lead to help.  I had several bouts of debilitating depression in the military (way suckier than in an academic environment ;-) ).  During one of these, I found out some very powerful information about one leader in our unit (i.e., I learned about something that could have led to him being discharged dishonorably).  Thankfully, he recognized my depression, so we made a deal.  As a result I was able to get off-the-record therapy from a local, civilian counselor, but there were <i>no</i> concessions at work.  While I was in school I dealt with several more bouts of depression.  In most cases, simply telling the professor that I wasn&#x27;t up my normal speed (i.e. never saying I was depressed; in several cases, I wasn&#x27;t aware that it was happening again) led to delayed deadlines or other concessions.  I happened to be in university during a particularly bad bout of depression and a classmate took me to the university clinic.  My classmate had a conversation with the doctor before I saw the doctor (I can only imagine what was said).  That was the first time I was formally diagnosed, and it was the first time I was prescribed anti-depressants.  As I mentioned previously, I have a lot of academic family ties, and I hear about situations like this very frequently.  I&#x27;ve never heard about similar support in a non-academic workplace.<p>> I simply assumed I wasn&#x27;t smart enough to graduate, much less do physics. In retrospect I see this obviously wasn&#x27;t true, since I&#x27;m happily reading a quantum field theory book in my spare time now and, as I said before, ended up being one of the better students in some of my classes. But if you&#x27;d asked me at the time I&#x27;d have probably just rambled a bunch of guesses and speculation. I suppose my point is that, even following those suggestions, some people will still fall through the cracks. And also that most of these institutions are just bureaucratic monoliths that aren&#x27;t built to be flexible with every students particular needs and such.<p>Remember that institutions, even bureaucratic monolithic institutions, are made of people.  In my experience, the people in academic institutions are particularly helpful if they know, or even just suspect, that a student needs help.  The biggest single success factor I&#x27;ve seen is having a mentor (hence my last tip).  This is not to say that you can succeed without a lot of hard work, but having a mentor helps you find the help that you need, when you need it (e.g., taking you to the doctor to be diagnosed with depression; getting an interlibrary loan ASAP; giving you career advice; letting you know where you rank in your program).<p>> The bias there tends to be heavily towards the institutions, too, since students who do poorly are just deemed slackers or unfit for college, instead of considering it a systemic or structural aspect of the system that favors certain people and situations over others. Even the stereotypical &quot;partiers&quot; who drink their way through college could be viewed as a systemic result of a toxic social environment. I believe there was another comment here to the effect of &quot;this is college and you&#x27;re done with baby hand-holding,&quot; which is true in one sense, but it shouldn&#x27;t be used as an excuse to disregard anyone doing badly in the system or a particular school as acceptable attrition for a just-good-enough educational system.<p>This is extremely institution-specific.  I have seen and heard about institutions, or departments, like this, but I&#x27;ve experienced and heard about many more that are vested in their students&#x27; success, both in and out of the classroom.  If you can complete your bachelors degree at a small, private institution, I&#x27;d highly recommend it!  (I&#x27;ve never heard of a small, private institution that wasn&#x27;t extremely vested in their students&#x27; success in and out of class.)  I wish I had known when I was an undergrad that there were &quot;free&quot; options (they aren&#x27;t actually free, but are extremely low-cost).  The only free college that I can vouch for (i.e. I know a successful alumnus who speaks highly of the experience) is <a href""http://www.deepsprings.edu/hom"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.deepsprings.edu/home</a> and it only awards associate degrees.  The friend I know who is an alumnus is now a professor in the sciences at a top university.  He credits much of his academic success to his experiences at and friendships from Deep Springs.",1388257535
