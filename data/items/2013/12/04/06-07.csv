6845394,comment,6844657,6845094,1,0,dmfdmf,,,"I am coming at this from a philosophic perspective so I don&#x27;t know how much I can explain the mathematics. I am following Aristotle who held that infinity cannot actually exist; it is a potential, an abstraction. For something to actually exist it must be specific, it must be definite (which is a metaphysical principle) and for something to be &quot;infinite&quot; means a quantity, amount, characteristic, etc. that is not specified by definition.<p>The genus of infinity is &quot;process&quot;, some kind of identifiable change, such as adding one to a number to get the next number in a sequence, that is open-ended. Infinity identifies the open-endedness of the process but any real process (such as you counting &quot;to infinity&quot;) must terminate as some point and must have a definite state at any given moment (such as being at 2,345,652 at such and such date and time).<p>In sum, a completed infinity would mean an open-ended process that has stopped which contradicts the meaning of infinity, at least on my terms. Moreover, in my view Cantor makes exactly the same conceptual mistake as a child that uses the phrase &quot;counting to infinity&quot;.<p>NB: To be fair, infinity is a valid mathematical concept but it has to be used very carefully to avoid sliding into non-sense. Some of Cantor&#x27;s work may actually be valid, I do not know. But given my views I suspect that his basic error is trying to &quot;count the unspecified&quot;, i.e. the infinite. This whole approach appears to be invalid since the concept &quot;counting&quot; necessarily presupposes that what you are counting has a specific identity. Unfortunately, to separate the wheat from the chaff means some future mathematician will need to become an epistemologist to sort it all out as the problem is in philosophy not mathematics.",1386139296

Sorry for anyone who already read it already.<p>---<p>My understanding of Node.JS and libuv community is as an outsider. I don&#x27;t follow what&#x27;s going on unless it is on the front page of HN once in a while and other forums.<p>But one impression I get from Node.JS and its surrounding community is arrogance and immaturity. This is from top to down -- companies sponsoring it (Joyent) and many of its vocal proponents. I see plenty of energy, enthusiasm, but mixed with immaturity. &quot;We don&#x27;t know what are doing, but darn it! we will be very vocal and do it with lots of enthusiasm&quot;.<p>One guy doesn&#x27;t want to commit a trivial change. It blows up into a media shitstorm. Reverted commits. Joyent&#x27;s reaction is what surprised me -- &quot;While we would fire Ben over this&quot;. This guy doesn&#x27;t even work for them. Hypothetically firing people, hmm, so committed to Women&#x27;s Rights, they are hypothetically hiring, and firing this person on the spot. Have they talked to him in private? StrongLoop, a company I never heard of until this point, is a bit more mature, that&#x27;s good to see, but even they couldn&#x27;t resist the veiled threat.<p>What is sad, as a whole this episode just reinforced the (hopefully wrong) stereotype I have of the community. Joyent instead of helping the community (which I think they thought they did by writing that blog post), are hurting it.\nBuying into and spending time and money learning a platform/language is also an implicit buy in/participation in the community. So far it screams to me &quot;stay away&quot;. Hopefully it will grow up at some point.<p>---",1386138316

Different royalty rates, different implications.  It comes down to the fact that on Pandora, you can&#x27;t request particular songs.<p>For that reason, artists don&#x27;t tend to mind Pandora too much, since any royalty income they get from Pandora is basically gravy.  It doesn&#x27;t really rob album sales.  You <i>could</i> argue that it robs radio play (since radio is less popular now), leading to lower royalties that way, but it&#x27;s a different beast than Spotify.  For Spotify, a person can request a certain artist/song and listen to the stream, without buying the track/album.  It robs album/download sales, and it&#x27;s debatable (to put it charitably) whether the &quot;music discovery&quot; benefit makes up for that loss.",1386137471

I sucked at math during school, mostly due to bad teachers early on which lead to a fear of math in later years when it got more advanced and my foundations were weak. I would like to re-teach myself math from the absolute beginnings, covering everything that my high school education would of covered if I had of taken advanced math subjects in my final years. If I were to do ALL of Kahn&#x27;s math content, would that more or less cover everything and leave me as equipped? The topics listed seem pretty extensive.<p>It might help to know I&#x27;m in Australia and high school for us goes to year 12, after which we go to University. The final year more advanced math subjects covers topics such as differential calculus, integral calculus, circular functions, probability and the behaviour of functions with a single real variable, conic sections, complex numbers, differential equations, kinematics, vector calculus and mechanics (taken from a wikipedia description of the subject).<p>Thoughts and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",1386137292

But other ways to get there is to have a product good enough that at least you get repeat customers, and still yet another way is to find a way to cheaply acquire new customers through advertising/marketing/distribution channels/etc (i.e., &quot;growth hacker&quot; route). That last one is pretty hard to sustain if your product is &quot;bad&quot; but might work if your product is &quot;ok&quot;. The other two require varying degrees of positive customer experiences.<p>Generally the tried and true way to get the job done is to build a product that reliably gets return customers to maximize customer lifetime value. Then you continually reinvest every dime you&#x27;ve got on sales/marketing to drive out that fast growth to give yourself advantages of scale as quickly as you possibly can.<p>This tried and true approach works better where you aren&#x27;t in a market where you are constantly reinventing your product/company (i.e., not the tech business). For tech companies, the referral approach is the easier one to pull off.<p>So while I wouldn&#x27;t entirely disagree with the article, I think as a consequence of perhaps being overly focused on tech, it&#x27;s under appreciating the value of a proper marketing & sales strategy.",1386137103

Otherwise, you get more financial upside if they buy the download.<p>So the question is if any discovery benefit will shrink that number enough.  This would include the people who stream and don&#x27;t buy but would never have bought in the first place, as well as the people who stream and then buy.<p>The answer is difficult to prove because you get into weird counterfactual questions, and there really aren&#x27;t any good studies out there from unbiased experimenters.
