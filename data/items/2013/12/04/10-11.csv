The industrial market will undoubtedly be served first by this (and Google&#x27;s probably carefully avoiding any hint of what I suggested -- heck, I already got downvoted for merely mentioning the possibility), but I&#x27;m pretty sure it will happen. The ethical implications are interesting to say the least. Complexity is interesting, too. Historically, it&#x27;s always been better to have specialised programming for the domain of use. Industrial/manufacturing purposes would indeed be a nicely delineated area. Once you make androids that have to deal with humans on a human level, pretty much all limits are gone as the entire gamut of human behaviour needs to be dealt with and a portion of it simulated. I suppose a sexbot of some kind is possible without being too complicated, just don&#x27;t expect it to cook you dinner afterwards.

This burn close to Earth launches your rocket on a ballistic curve to the target point, with the least energy on arrival at the target (slowest speed) necessary to get there. Necessarily, this means you start off going fast after the initial burn and you slow down due to Earth&#x27;s gravity as your altitude increases.<p>Trying to do it more slowly will just waste fuel. It would mean burning your engine less when close to Earth, not enough to reach your destination, then burning it again at higher altitude to stop Earth&#x27;s gravity pulling you back down again.

It was subsequently handled by many people, resulting in four deaths. About 112,000 people were examined for radioactive contamination and 249 were found to have significant levels of radioactive material in or on their body.

During hurricanes or say something like 100mph wind, the upper flower has to recede to save itself. This is not the case with standard wind turbines that just rotate only faster. I am sure they must have thought through all these situations, simply considering only 600% improvement over standard installation doesn&#x27;t seem like a good way to compare.",1386151315

If you don&#x27;t keep them off the site, real bankers will be turned off by the low SNR and abuse.<p>If it were my site, I would put in place a mechanism to filter them out at registration. People registering with the site would be required to supply an email address. Anyone who could provide a Bloomberg account (i.e. an email address @bloomberg.net) or an email address at a domain on a whitelist of known financial institutions (e.g. morganstanley.com, citi.com, gs.com, etc.) would automatically be accepted (and potentially given downvoting rights straight away) and so would anyone they invited/recommended/vouched for.<p>Anyone else would either (a) go into a queue for approval or (b) be given &quot;on probation&quot; access. If (a), someone would need to review the applications (presumably by checking the domain name of the applicant&#x27;s email address (and, if appropriate, adding that domain to the whitelist) and/or reviewing their LinkedIn profile. If (b), there could be a feedback mechanism that would automatically hellban the user if they received enough downvotes (or were flagged by a moderator), or promote them to &quot;approved&quot; if they received enough upvotes.<p>You could also allow &quot;approved&quot; users to hide comments from &quot;on probation&quot; users (similar to how Slashdot used to - may still do, for all I know - allow you to set a minimum karma limit).<p>That way, you make it really easy for legitimate finance professionals to join, while putting hurdles in place to make life difficult for the trolls and Occupy-ists. And you also generate a bit of scarcity-desirability through the invite mechanism.<p>Of course, as soon as it becomes successful/popular, you&#x27;ll probably find that the site gets flagged for filtering out by the web proxy filters the banks use. :-/",1386151289
