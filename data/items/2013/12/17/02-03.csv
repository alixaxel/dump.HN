6919320,story,,,2,4,mygoodness,"Ask HN: how do I get myself ready for the job market again?",,"I&#x27;ve been recently growing frustrated at my job - a few key people who I just can&#x27;t seem to click with and a technology stack that is getting better but still moving glacially.  For the most part, I love it, and I&#x27;m happy with a secure job where I can stretch my legs.  I&#x27;m young, though, only twenty four.  As much as I love it, it seems like there could be something better out there, and I think I&#x27;m finally ready to start looking.  The problem is, it&#x27;s been a while since I actually had a job interview.<p>Even worse, this job was/is my only technical interview.  Everything else was bog standard retail jobs.  I feel like I don&#x27;t even know how to look for a good job anymore.  It used to be trying to find the best hourly rate, but now I think about things like &quot;what&#x27;s going to give me the most happiness?&quot; or &quot;what kind of job would help me keep my skillset sharp and stay relevant?&quot;.  It&#x27;s frustrating to feel like I&#x27;m good at my job but not know how to find myself another one.<p>So, I turn to you Hacker News.  Do you have any tips on how I should get myself in shape to try and find another, better job?  Job boards to look at? Cover letter secrets?  Are cover letters still even a thing? Should I delete my Twitter account?  Help. :(",1387249125

I do think there is room and cross-disciplinary talent in media organizations for a journalist reporting on a (for example) programming heavy topic to grab someone from their engineering staff to collaborate and then share a by-line.

I tried a few times to get involved with what Counterpane used to be, with the intent of trying to get some facetime with Schneier to really find out who he was (was very deterministic about finding a good mentor at the time).  Long story short - BT was so fragmented internally to tie the name BT to Counterpane, or even Schneier was a joke.  It was obvious after the first few months that BT bought Counterpane for the talking head (IMHO) which I still feel was true up until now.  Schneier&#x27;s name was worth more than the IP they bought, most likely.  Sad state of affairs. BT was, and still today, has no interest in improving security within their own telecom products, but wanted to be very good at the emerging pentesting market (back in 2007&#x27;ish).

That&#x27;s the problem with hypotheticals, you can expound ad infinitum.<p>> The problem is that for a percentage of children (varies by country, but quite high in the third world), handing the responsibility of their education to their parents is even shittier.<p>Which doesn&#x27;t matter. The question isn&#x27;t what&#x27;s more economically efficient or favourable to higher literacy rates. It&#x27;s a matter of morality. If the state requires me to let them raise my children, and threatens me with force if I do not, then in your opinion, who&#x27;s in the wrong?<p>Now of course, things need to be in context. But you can&#x27;t simply make an assertion that the state will always be better of a parent to a child than even a poor or illiterate or even neglectful parent. The problem with the ability to exert pressure on persons to send their children to public schooling is that it violates a natural and historical bond, and replaces it with &quot;the monopoly on violence&quot; in the name of justice. Always in the name of justice.<p>Ask yourself this, if you&#x27;re worried about children becoming illiterate, then surely you&#x27;re worried about children joining armies to fight economic wars, children being locked in prison for nonviolent crimes, and children being used to scapegoat authoritarian measures right? What about the children -is not a defense between the DPRK threatening to take my child because I won&#x27;t permit them to indoctrinate her.",1387246503
