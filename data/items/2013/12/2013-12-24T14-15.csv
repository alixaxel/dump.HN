I know investors like to see confidence, but if you seriously believe your own hype, you&#x27;ll be unprepared for failure. Chances are, you&#x27;ll fail. Nothing to do with talent or how good your product is. Just luck. Learn humility. It will keep you from letting your guard down, and getting trampled on.

But to the author of the article&#x27;s point that programming languages structure our thinking, the idea that &quot;or&quot; must be either in the core language or part of some library illustrates the constraints imposed on expressing our ideas absent the ability to introduce new syntax via a lisp-style macro facility.

Their are so many flaws in this design, at least from the video demonstration of it. I hate when people disable comments and voting for a video, clearly they are afraid of critics. If the box is as easy to open as they show on the video (push down and it pops open) will lead to it opening during transit. Good idea but I think their lack of actual shipping experience or the process a package goes through is leading them to make assumptions that are incorrect. Also, cardboard is already 100% recyclable so reducing use of cardboard isn&#x27;t a benefit for shipping other than weight. It makes the box more likely to take damage... Tape isn&#x27;t an issue with recycling the cardboard as far as I know.",1387897022

I think his point about lightweight data modeling is spot on - Clojure is a language that goes out of its way to make modeling your problems idiomatically painless and dramatically simpler than most other languages.<p>It&#x27;s idiomatic in Clojure to use plain old maps to represent structures or entities in your program that you would otherwise represent with a class or equivalent construct in many Object Oriented languages. That isn&#x27;t a code smell either - it&#x27;s idiomatic and wonderful.

6959487,comment,6959355,6959395,14,0,jerf,,,"I expect the JVM to still be going; at least one of Clojure or Scala will probably continue growing for a long time, and there&#x27;s room for both. It&#x27;s also possible another Algol-esque language that isn&#x27;t Java, but is syntactically closer to Java, making people more comfortable, will arise. At some point one of them may even become the &quot;primary&quot; JVM language, with Java hanging on as legacy, but due to the fact Java just compiles to the JVM, there won&#x27;t be any reason to get rid of it, as the maintenance effort is virtually 0. I expect C# to probably still be going. I&#x27;m not sure anything can actually kill C, even though something really should.<p>C++ I can see going either way; it is a <i>freakishly</i> complicated language (and getting more complicated with every standard that comes out) that IMHO was primarily kept aloft by being the &quot;default&quot; language in Windows for a <i>very</i> long time. I expect Rust will be most of the way through eating it alive in 15 years. Or something like Rust, but Rust is looking pretty solid. And if you want a multithreaded systems language... and you will... I suspect in practice it&#x27;s going to be an order of magnitude easier to program in than C++ in another three or four years. Maybe Rust will even be eating C. (About damn time!) Someone will probably be writing an OS kernel in Rust. Possibly one that is driver-compatible with Linux, or even just straight-up a Linux-compatible kernel.<p>If Google doesn&#x27;t drop the ball, Go will probably be mature and still going, and probably the primary reason why Ruby and friends are considered legacy code. Go even today very nearly replaces the scripting languages in flexibility (though definitely not <i>quite</i>), but brings back stronger typing and better performance. A few more tweaks to it over the next 5 years and it&#x27;ll be hard to see why I&#x27;d start a new project in a &quot;scripting&quot; language. (Part of the reason I think this is that I observe that in the past 15 years, no language has penetrated into the A-list without some sort of major corporate backer. While there&#x27;s plenty of other possibilities from a technical point of view, and while Google is not very aggressively pushing Go, I still think it&#x27;s more support than any other language has or is likely to have in the near future. Even if they just passively continue to do little more than employ the authors, this is likely to continue floating up the ranks.)<p>And I still sort of expect something to come up that is not Haskell, but is closer to Haskell than anything currently existing. Or possible Haskell simply keeps plugging along and manages to become a very solid B-list language. I doubt it&#x27;ll ever break into the A-list &quot;nobody got fired for choosing C/C++/Java/C#&quot; level of popularity, but it might settle firmly into where &quot;it&#x27;s pretty hard to get fired for choosing Python/Ruby/PHP&quot; is today. (It&#x27;s brushing B-list status now, but it&#x27;s got a ways to go before I&#x27;d call it <i>solid</i> B-list.) I also think there&#x27;s a good chance it will acquire a reputation as being the tool of choice for tackling truly complicated systems. (Though Rust will eat into the bottom end of that a bit too, they&#x27;re currently retreating from some of the tools that Haskell has that may allow it to acquire this reputation. I think Haskell will still retain a strong advantage here.)<p>And finally, some sort of wildcard. 15 years ago I doubt anybody would have predicted Haskell being where it is now, even Haskell users (if you can even call it the same l. New languages shall continue to bubble and froth, but at least one and probably two will either emerge from the froth and become a B-list language. Probably at least one of them will be a aggressively &quot;practical&quot; language that will be a reaction to the success of &quot;excessively-academic&quot; Clojure, Scala, Rust, and the Haskell-like I hypothesize above, and follow a hype curve very similar to Ruby or Node.<p>It occurs to me I&#x27;m looking more like 10 years into the future here than 15. Oh well. Close enough. I&#x27;m also well aware I&#x27;m just talking out my ass; I completely expect to look back and laugh at this in 10 to 15 years. Oh well again.",1387896038

Many Clojure libraries make use of atoms, agents, and dynamic scope (which is arguably a concurrency primitive, given the thread locality of the bindings, but not unique to Clojure).<p>While &quot;concurrency is not parallelism&quot;, parallelism is a special case of concurrent programs that is often challenging. Clojure&#x27;s offerings here too are compelling - we have the amazing Reducers library which allows you to write higher order functions for collections that, as Rich Hickey put it, &quot;know how to reduce themselves&quot; - and get parallelism (without locks, without even thinking about it really) on top of that.<p>And then there&#x27;s the lazy parallel functions - pmap, pcalls, pvalues. Check them out if you haven&#x27;t. I use Clojure often in a machine learning context with Hadoop/Storm, these abstractions are highly valuable in crafting solutions.<p>Futures/promises are also widely used in Clojure.<p>I&#x27;m confused as to why you think data structure literals are part of Clojure&#x27;s core thesis.

The &quot;lack of texture and softened edges&quot; are a choice of the model used, not a consequence of the transform.  True also of DCT and blocking artifacts.  This should be obvious since both approaches allow for lossless encoders.<p>Typically wavelets will beat or match JPEG in any situation both in terms of psnr and the like, and perceptually (though this latter is much more controversial and poorly defined -- and to be fair I am not up to date on the literature here but I would be surprised of that has changed in the last decade).<p>The real reason for the huge popularity of DCT in still compression at first and video codecs later is that it is cheap to implement in hardware.

A few things I can add:<p>1. You&#x27;re right in thinking that bootstrapping users will be much harder than coding the site. A dating site requires not just a critical mass of users, but also a critical mass using it in a certain location with enough people that there are internal compatibilities.<p>2. We loosely categorized our users into 3 groups. (a) those explicitly interesting in dating.  (b) those who would consider it, but who weren&#x27;t ready to make the decision, and (c) those who would never sign up for our dating features.  Our early strategy was to (try to) nail all 3 groups, arguing that there was mobility between b and a, and that group c could still be used to spread around dating-related toys without realizing that&#x27;s what they were doing. All this led us to personality tests and a bunch of other goofy things that attempted to be viral but could also enhance a profile if converted. On average, 10% of our early users became online daters on our site, and the other 90% were spreading the word in one way or another, but we never heard from them again.  As we got bigger, we slowly shifted our message towards the dating side of things, as those &quot;growth hacks&quot; diluted our message.<p>Of course this is not the only strategy.  Consider (1) Tinder, a very simple dating app, which has become a phenomenon. I would say it&#x27;s hard just to invent this phenonmen, though... And (2) pay dating services, which can collect membership fees and then use the money to market. It&#x27;s an expensive game which requires a lot of cash and marketing knowledge.<p>Disclaimer: I left OkCupid a year ago.",1387895080

I turned into a monster.  9 cars (yes, all for me) and other stupid crap that I&#x27;m ashamed even to recall now.<p>Come to think of it, some of my buddies who made it out of the ghetto did the same thing, at first.  It does take a while of being &quot;secure&quot; that the money isn&#x27;t going to be taken away, before you start to think the way the author does.  It&#x27;s when you&#x27;re surrounded by stuff and your life still feels empty.  When you realize most the rappers were sellout pieces of garbage who, during the daytime socialize with the dentists they live next to if they can and rarely rap about how crappy a life surrounded with material wealth can also be.<p>Fortunately, knowing a couple of billionaires helps.  I sat down with one and expressed my frustration in how I felt and how I had slowly but surely become someone I never really aspired be.  It was at this point in my life it suddenly hit me.  I&#x27;d known this guy for a while and had never seen him flaunt his money like I did (and he had a lot more of it than me).  Then he told me that money for him is a tool.  If you start using it to become a &quot;consumer&quot;, you become consumed by it.  He is not just free to do whatever, because in some way that is selfish too.  Rather he uses his money to help others and makes the most positive changes in the world that he can.  I know that&#x27;s true because it&#x27;s not just his money but he actually devoted, the much more precious commodity, of time, to his philanthropic efforts.  Efforts he started when he had money like me, except he decided early on to give his away rather than spend it on himself.<p>It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of money to be free.  I live off less than a 1/3 of what I was before and have a few more in my family now (I was single before).  I work with some amazing people and am trying to work on making things better for others on a daily basis.  One non-profit I help out from time to time has been tackling the issue of homeless families (not substance abuse or psychiatric issue related, primarily economic issues), and not surprisingly, it&#x27;s often about the parents&#x27; attitude towards money.  It would be nice if they felt &quot;secure&quot; enough to understand that money won&#x27;t buy happiness and were frugal by choice.  It would really help if more people had the luxury to have the author&#x27;s opinions, but thanks to culture/advertising or whatever, there&#x27;s a large contingent of people who need to think about money differently but don&#x27;t.",1387894184

He succeeded and progressed so did humanity.<p>But this also has led me to think, what was Microsoft strategy when actually everyone would have a computer in their homes. Microsoft’s sole aim apparently was to provide basic to pro computing at personal level. But there does not seem an apparent strategy present for the period, when everyone has at least one computer in their home.<p>People now have enough computers laying around. They do not need computer any more. Or for that matter, they do not need an ordinary computer any more. The technical level of computer users generally has increased. Even my Dad now uses Youtube for uploading his personal videos. (in Pakistan, a 3rd World). This is just a simplest example to give an idea, how computer users worldwide have become tech-savvier.<p>And this is the sole point of post, Microsoft apparently did not have intelligent strategy for the tech-savvy PC era, or when computer users are no longer, just sending emails via Outlook, composing letters using Word, and preparing spreadsheets using Excel.<p>The above period is over. You can no longer sell your product based on above, there are millions of tools available even for free, (OpenOffice). Moreover, users simply do not want products that merely feature what they do. They want smart products, that assist them and are based on user-experience and as well as look neat. I know Microsoft is catching up, however in the same fashion they catched up with gmail after 10 years. (ref: new outlook.com, it took them 10 years to make it somewhat at part with Gmail.)<p>I won’t name the company which has filled above gap and went from $3 Billion to all the way to $500 Billion surpassing every and each one.",1387894159

It often leads to some very gross code.<p>However, programmers write ugly code in every language and even in a much more beautiful language like Ruby, there are so many projects that end up with ugly codebases, poor performance, etc. that PHP by no means holds an exclusive ownership of terrible coding practices.<p>Writing high quality code in any language takes significant effort on an ongoing basis. Practices like TDD, code review, pairing, etc. can help, but only if they are applied with significant effort.",1387894127

What I notice, having never used Clojure, is that the Clojure devs may well finish the implementation while the Scala devs are still discussing the design.  Of course, that level of flexibility will better suit some problems.  I read a high profile project&#x27;s coding guidelines recently: &quot;Scala is a very flexible language.  Use restraint.&quot;  Perl&#x27;s TMTOWTDI is the reason I moved to Python.  I&#x27;ve recently been using Go instead of Scala, partly again because TMTOWTDI, whereas Go is supremely clean, but also, I think, Scala is just too big for my needs, a skyscraper when I need a house.  This sounds a bit like sql vs nosql, rather than when should I use x vs y.  I look forward to trying Clojure.",1387893863

How many systems out there that people are writing make heavy, or even significant, use of concurrency primitives?

Lisp, dynamic, and functional are obviously the other big choices that were made to achieve the overarching goal of the language - simplification.
