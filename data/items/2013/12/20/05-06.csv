6940141,comment,6937431,6940022,4,0,A_COMPUTER,,,"Your right to free speech begins and ends with speech. You have a right to call for marijuana legalization, but if marijuana is illegal and you light up a joint in front of a cop, then yes he can arrest you and this is no violation of your free speech rights. Correspondingly, your right to free speech, right here and right now, is naturally pre-empted when you have no legal right to even be in the country. From the perspective of the US government, you are perfectly free to exercise your opinion about immigration reform from outside of the borders of the USA. The fact that this is obviously less desirable from the point of view of the illegal alien is basically irrelevant to what they have a &quot;right&quot; to do.<p>What you are talking about is civil disobedience, but you don&#x27;t seem to understand how that works either. Civil disobedience is knowing something is against the law, and doing it anyway as an act of political resistance to motivate change in the system. Even then, you accept that an act is illegal and that you are breaking that law, rather than just blanket argument that anybody who is actively protesting a law should be allowed to break it without legal consequences because they disagree with it. I get it, you&#x27;re for immigration reform so you think it&#x27;s a stupid law and you don&#x27;t care if they break it.

6940139,comment,6937431,6939430,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"The trouble with this is the state of the law and the power dynamics in play. It&#x27;s almost impossible to prove that charges were &quot;absurdly trumped up&quot; because there are so many outrageously broad felonies on the books and prosecutors are clever enough to choose ones that at least vaguely resemble what the defendants were actually doing. Meanwhile you have to protect prosecutors who attempt to prosecute politically powerful defendants from the defendants using their political power to retaliate against the prosecutor. Which means that prosecutors have a lot of discretion and bar associations, while theoretically capable of taking action, generally won&#x27;t.<p>At the end of the day it&#x27;s the &quot;who watches the watchers&quot; problem. Prosecutors are the ones supposed to be prosecuting misconduct. Who are we going to get to prosecute them, and how is it we can trust them to do it when they ought to and not when they ought not to, any more than we can trust the original prosecutors?<p>The answer has to be in taking away the ability to abuse the law by taking away the broad prohibitions with high penalties that prosecutors are so fond of abusing. There is no call for a non-violent offender to be made a felon in any but the most exceptional and rare of cases, which means that the law should make it nearly impossible for a prosecutor to make that case. It is not necessary to use the penal system to destroy the life of everyone who makes a wrong decision; particularly when structuring things that way also allows it to destroy the lives of everyone who makes a reasoned decision to resist the status quo.",1387518589

6940127,comment,6938645,6939580,1,0,nilkn,,,"I would tend to agree with you. I probably started out like that fresh out of college (though not to such an extreme). In my case, I wasn&#x27;t afraid of other people judging my code; I was just afraid of introducing bugs into the actual product. I often waited too long to merge some of my changes or features into the master branch because I wanted to delay the stress of letting them go live. It didn&#x27;t help that the company I worked for actually kept a record (effectively a leaderboard) of how many hotfixes each developer had submitted; that pushed me to &quot;hoard&quot; more than I otherwise would have.<p>My advice to anybody who thinks they have an &quot;Island + Hoarder&quot; combo on their team is to just initiate conversation more often with them. Their behavior can almost certainly be traced back to an excess of anxiety regarding something about their job, either social interactions or (as was my case) fear of having to do a dreaded hotfix and have it permanently on my record at the company. Reassuring them that they have nothing to be anxious about can solve the problem.",1387518348

Clearly California is (and has been for a long time) too big for its shoes, as evidenced by its complete idiocy when it comes to passing budgets that do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.

Now our number of Senators per person will be about average.</i><p>On the other hand, California gains an <i>enormous</i> amount of power every four years due to the huge number of electoral college votes it commands. No other single state has anything like California&#x27;s 55 electoral votes; the next closest is Texas, which has just 38.<p>In other words, California, all by itself, gets a candidate 20% of the way to the magic 270 votes needed to win the Presidency. This makes it very hard for any serious candidate to ignore or otherwise bypass.<p>Splitting California up would dilute this power, allowing candidates to write off parts it more easily.

Now that you&#x27;re cutting people&#x27;s wages ... you&#x27;ve seriously pissed them off.<p>> Price doesn&#x27;t signal that there is demand for their goods, demand signals that there is demand. Price is a reflection of demand / supply, not the other way around.<p>I&#x27;m glad you know what a demand curve is. I actually know how to calculate one since I have a formal education in economics and actually took econometrics.<p>I also ran a pretty successful retail outfit that had revenue in the millions.<p>Do you know how many times I calculated a demand curve? Zero.<p>It would have been a waste of time. <i>Because I&#x27;m not the only player in the market.</i> I don&#x27;t have the data.<p>What data do I have? More people are buying my shit. I&#x27;m running out of stock. Let me increase my prices. My prices increased, now people are buying the same amount of shit they did before. I am making more money. I feel good. Oh crap, my supplier increased his prices. My supplier is an asshole. But people are buying my stuff, I just increased prices, things are good!<p>99% of merchants operate in this way. Yes, I knew the changes were nominal. They still made me feel good. Inflation wins.<p>> But don&#x27;t they, similarly, feel bad when they see everybody elses&#x27; prices also increase? They know that their paycheck gets less and less at other stores.<p>No normal human being makes the connection between prices and their paycheck. Not even economists. Yes, that&#x27;s the <i>rational</i> conclusion. The world doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>When I get a raise, I&#x27;m happy with my boss and about my work. When I see prices rise at the store, I&#x27;m pissed at the store. There is zero connection there, even though it&#x27;s obviously all connected.<p>People aren&#x27;t computers.<p>> I&#x27;d argue that such debt isn&#x27;t all that healthy for the long-term growth of an economy.<p>While I would probably agree with you, the inverse of saving is not debt. It&#x27;s the lack of saving. You can skip saving a single dollar and still be debt free.",1387516331
6940042,comment,6936672,6939828,3,0,IgorPartola,,,"Both you and your parent comment are incorrect. Self-defense vs first strike becomes a gradient very quickly. And the biggest issue is that the person interpreting what happened is usually the one that used the violence.<p>But back to the main point, there is a world of difference between &quot;self-defense&quot; and &quot;violence used to prevent additional violence&quot;. Self-defense is immediate: someone is punching you, so you punch back. The other thing... it doesn&#x27;t have to be. In my mind, self-defense is justified. But self-defense is defined as &quot;have no other reasonable option&quot;, and thus is fairly narrow. If you can negotiate, if you can protect your interests by deterring the enemy, if you can eliminate the enemy without violence, by say sanctions, etc. then you have options and it&#x27;s not self-defense. Also, self-defense is not the condition where violence is the best option. It&#x27;s only self-defense when violence is the <i>only</i> option.<p>Perhaps violence is justified when it&#x27;s not self-defense, but I don&#x27;t think you can call any first-strike &quot;self-defense&quot; in order to gain the high moral ground.",1387516318

As for military conscription, that only applies to citizens, so if your children take US citizenship instead of Singaporean citizenship (US practices Jus Sanguinis, so I think this is possible), they wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about military service (I&#x27;m not Singaporean or an immigration lawyer, so don&#x27;t take my word on that).
