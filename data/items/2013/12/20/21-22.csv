6944336,comment,6943948,6944191,1,0,feral,,,"There are really two different problems you are mentioning there.<p>Problem 1 is the typical recommendation-system/ML problem of &#x27;cold start&#x27;, where there isn&#x27;t sufficient training data examples to produce good predictions.\n(Recommender systems based on clustering of items and users are particularly vulnerable to this.)<p>Problem 2 is a different problem, which is where you only have a small amount of data for each user (low dimensional feature data), where, even if you had a lot of examples, you wouldn&#x27;t have enough information about each example (i.e. enough features) to make predictions.<p>Problem 2 isn&#x27;t really as big an issue here as you might think.\nYou mention a limited amount of available information: &quot;referring url, browser, perhaps first or third party cookies, visit time, etc.&quot;\nThis is actually a fair amount of feature data, if you treat it in the right way - even just browser+IP are.<p>If our system just has IP address, we&#x27;ll build features to do with geo-location, and derive features like predicted income level from a combination of geo and device/browser.<p>Now, those features are only useful if they are predictive - if its the case that the set of options you want to choose between will vary in some way that correlates with those features.<p>However, this is often the case.  If you have a global website, users from some geographies will have different preferences.  Time-of-day is also an important feature.  Further, if you want to adjust the discount you give people, how modern their hardware (from the user agent) is is a good signal.\nThose are just examples - there&#x27;s a lot in there, if you treat it right.<p>Even these very common, lowest-common-denominator features can thus give you better results than just blindly pretending your population is a homogeneous whole, which is what existing bandit approaches do.  Further, our API supports custom features, too.<p>Problem 1 is a more technical question.<p>The honest answer is that the particular type of framework we use doesn&#x27;t really suffer from that problem.<p>Our solution is adaptive.  If there are very few training data points, then our system will treat the problem as if the user population is relatively homogeneous, and will attempt to predict the best option for the population as a whole - like a traditional bandit algorithm would, or like the result you&#x27;d get from a simple AB testing framework.<p>However, as the amount of data gets large, our system functions more like a predictive model (i.e. like a ML system) and less like a simple bandit algorithm.<p>This means that there&#x27;s really no cold-start problem with the learning algorithm - instead, there&#x27;s a transition to finer and finer predictions as the data density increases.  So it ends up using the data <i>roughly</i> as efficiently (not quite as efficiently, but close) as a custom solution which is calibrated to the level of available data would.<p>And that&#x27;s an awful lot more efficient than running an AB test for a fixed length of time, and waiting to see the results.<p>If you want more detail, maybe have a read of our FAQ: <a href=\"http://www.synference.com/faq.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.synference.com/faq.html</a>\nor send me an e-mail.",1387576677

Disrupt Google!<p>Lots of posts here &quot;there&#x27;s more constructive ways to deal with this&quot;.  How constructive is a bunch of pigs evicting a family because their landlord is jacking up the rent because a bunch of Google hipster yuppies want to slum it in Oakland?<p>Then there&#x27;s the usual &quot;these people weren&#x27;t the poorest people in Oakland&quot; posts.  The police shoot people like Oscar Grant dead over nothing in Oakland, I could imagine if a swarm of young black men started throwing rocks at Google buses.  The whiners here win either way - either they would get a Fox News story about how apolitical young black thugs are harrassing Google workers, or we get the comments here complaining that this is not what they were confronted with.<p>It&#x27;s not like the moneyed classes aren&#x27;t pulling the political strings in the Bay Area now, like Ron Conman getting his boy Ed Lee in as San Francisco mayor.  Which goes to other inane comments of the &quot;why don&#x27;t they do this outside the mansions in Altadena, instead of to us poor six-figure Google employees?&quot;  Well the Altadena people aren&#x27;t the ones gentrifying Oakland and driving rents up.  Some people here claim that Oakland residents like that gentrifiers are coming in and driving up rents, which shows how out of touch they are.<p>People here are so out of touch they forget (perhaps excepting people like Ben Horowitz) that the Black Panthers were born in Oakland.

So why don&#x27;t these protesters start showing up to city council meetings, or at property management companies, etc.? Target the landlords and the politicians.

I see you worrying about the scenario where no amount of explanation Bob can give is enough to get him in the door. That&#x27;s fine. But I&#x27;m arguing that Bob <i>should</i> have to do some explaining, and I&#x27;m arguing that if you do want the NSA - the institution - to suffer effective consequences, then you <i>must</i> accept that individual members will also face some gnarly consequence, because that&#x27;s how institutions in a social context work. You cannot meaningfully punish the institution without also punishing its members.

The two psychos I&#x27;ve met in my life couldn&#x27;t have cared less for attention from the public at large or validation of their struggles. I can&#x27;t really imagine them writing an open letter about their condition, an act that doesn&#x27;t provide tangible control, or money, nor damages an enemy. On the other hand, narcissists needs validation and attention and writing an open letter is attention-seeking behaviour (which we are involuntarily feeding).",1387575033

(Read techies). And soon the time comes for the hippy - artists to move out.<p>The hippy - artists are unhappy... but the reality is... this is no more than what they did to the blacks.<p>Soon the time will come for the techies to move out... and, I&#x27;m sure, they will be unhappy as well when their time comes.<p>This same progression happens all over. I think Harlem is probably one of the best examples. (It&#x27;s WAY ahead of SF area in that regard). Blacks had to move when the artists showed up because they could no longer afford it. Then, when the techies and yuppies showed up... the hippies, artists and teachers hit the roof, because it was their turn to move. Harlem is at the stage now where the celebrities and bankers are showing up ... and like clockwork ... the techies are hitting the roof because it&#x27;s their turn to move.<p>The thing is ... in the end ... they all moved. They didn&#x27;t engage in violence.<p>That people are upset should be expected... but I would point out that places like Harlem have gone through this process with multiple populations without violence. It can be done.",1387573233
