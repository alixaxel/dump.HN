Within a couple hours, it was being used at stores in Los Angeles. I live a 3+ hour drive from LA so there&#x27;s no way the skimmer/data was physically taken down there–the data had to have been transferred (cell?) to someone down there pretty quickly.<p>My card was used at a restaurant and a few different stores, but several times per store. Total amount charged was about $2K. All purchases were < $100 and most purchases were for very even amounts at drug stores. Based on research, this is because buying gift cards is a favorite use of stolen cards. Gift cards can be turned into cash online for about 75-85 cents on the dollar.<p>Chase was very good about freezing the card and crediting back all the fraudulent charges.<p>TIPS:<p>- Use cash or a gas card for gas OR at the very least, use a pump close to the cashier<p>- Debit cards have a reputation for having less protection than credit cards. At least at Chase, this is no longer true. Chase has zero-liability for unauthorized debit card purchases [1]<p>- Check your online banking often<p>- Don&#x27;t rely on your bank&#x27;s automated fraud detection. Most alerts I&#x27;ve received from Chase have been false positives (legitimate purchases while traveling).<p>[1] <a href=\"https://www.chase.com/checking/debit-cards\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.chase.com/checking/debit-cards</a>",1387565794

The judge had some harsh words for the APD, and the charges were reduced to misdemeanors and the sentence (which was originally looking like years in prison) to time served. Though, one of the protesters in this case ended up spending about 2 years in jail because he had a past warrant (he missed his court date for that old warrant in Dallas because he was in jail on a felony charge in Houston, so they punished him for missing that date). He was just released a few weeks ago.<p>It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that APD did not reveal their officers had made the devices or suggested their use in the action, and fought to not reveal their involvement in court. The Houston police department, who were prosecuting the case, didn&#x27;t even know APD was involved in the protest, until a few lucky breaks led to three of the six undercover officers being outed. It is, frankly, miraculous that those seven kids aren&#x27;t still in jail and shackled with felony convictions. Dumb luck revealed that they&#x27;d been setup, and the prosecutors were forced to fold.<p>But, it&#x27;s happening every day. This is standard operating procedure when dealing with protesters; and, not just at the national level. And, as far as we can tell, the chain of command on this particular operation went all the way up to the chief of police. It was not rogue cops going beyond their assigned duties to set kids up for felony charges.<p>Some references, so this doesn&#x27;t end up being dismissed as a paranoid fantasy (I know it&#x27;s pretty unbelievable stuff):<p><a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/austin-police-infiltrated-occupy-austin-1/nRqZN/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/austin-police-infil...</a><p><a href=\"http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Undercover-Austin-police-officers-aided-Houston-3841846.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Undercover-A...</a><p><a href=\"http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2012-09-07/apd-infiltrates-occupy/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2012-09-07/apd-infiltrat...</a><p>More came out later based on open records requests, but my google fu is failing me at the moment.

Most of the cool stuff an IDE does is code analysis and transformation e.g. refactoring, error analysis, and autofill. The other half is &quot;makes coding pretty&quot;, &quot;provides good shortcuts&quot;, and other UI considerations.<p>Now for the latter - that is great, and everyone has different strengths and weaknesses. And that is just a UX issue.<p>For the former however, I don&#x27;t know why I need to use different IDEs for different languages, or even different IDEs for different transforms to the same codebase in the same language (again, for the automated bits).<p>It would be so much better for the world if there was some common protocol between user environment and code transformer. That way I could buy some of JetBrains awesome plugins and have my trusty Vim or Emacs environments use them. I could just keep using IntelliJ with MS&#x27; plugins for C# (and resharper of course). And so on.<p>For stuff that really needs a special UI, we are in the age of the web browser. Provide a localhost server in your tool and make the reports etc live in a browser window, big GUI IDEs can provide a webkit that can link back to their own editors, but text editor users could still get the useful output.<p>This &quot;everyone does their own thing&quot; without even pretending interoperability is getting old.

So if you normally would have a $50,000 a year programming job at roughly $25/hr, your freelancing rate should be at least 1.5 times that or $37.50/hr.  I&#x27;ve also had trouble staying booked, so if you can manage 20 billable hours a week, you&#x27;re probably ahead of the curve.  So that&#x27;s a $36,000/yr income I guess, but you own your own time and don&#x27;t have to be in an office all day.  That alone is worth $14k to me.<p>I came in a little below that and got several gigs at $30/hr, mostly in esoteric areas like OpenGL programming.<p>Also I would recommend watching your job invites and you&#x27;ll start to notice which areas are the least sensitive to hourly rates.  For me that&#x27;s been 3D work in iOS, but YMMV.<p>I&#x27;m trying to move to a daily rate, in that case I would assume only 2-4 hours of coding daily because when you are really in the zone, most of your problem solving work happens off the computer.  So I think that&#x27;s why we see rates of $75 or even $125 or more quoted so often.<p>The other thing I&#x27;ve learned is that institutional work pays a lot more, so it&#x27;s better to find gigs for consultancies/studios/education, things like that, as opposed to individuals.  They seem to expect a rate of at least $50-75/hr and up.  In large cities the rate probably starts at $100/hr.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;m basically taking a pay cut as a freelancer so that I can work on my own projects, which have the potential to pay back exponentially someday, and are at the very least challenging and rewarding and keep my psyche going.  I&#x27;ve had jobs where the boss charged $100/hr and paid us $15/hr, and on top of that wanted us to work 9 hours or more a day, and I did the math and realized that I would never be able to achieve my goals if the lion&#x27;s share of my efforts went to someone else.",1387564951

6943118,comment,6942559,6942559,8,0,tokenadult,,,"Jelte Wicherts and his co-authors put a set of general suggestions for more open data in science research in an article in Frontiers of Computational Neuroscience (an open-access journal).[1]<p>&quot;With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.&quot;<p>Wicherts has published another article, &quot;Publish (Your Data) or (Let the Data) Perish! Why Not Publish Your Data Too?&quot;[2] on how important it is to make data available to other researchers. Wicherts does a lot of research on this issue to try to reduce the number of dubious publications in his main discipline, the psychology of human intelligence. When I see a new publication of primary research in that discipline, I don&#x27;t take it seriously at all as a description of the facts of the world until I have read that independent researchers have examined the first author&#x27;s data and found that they check out. Often the data are unavailable, or were misanalyzed in the first place.<p>[1] Jelte M. Wicherts, Rogier A. Kievit, Marjan Bakker and Denny Borsboom.

It&#x27;s fast because it&#x27;s been written with runtime efficiency in mind. Undefined behaviour comes from not making unnecessary assumptions on the underlying platform, which aids portability.<p>> But has a minimum of three times the memory overhead.[...]C sacrifices safety for speed and memory efficiency<p>Memory efficiency, yes. I, for one, prefer not to rely on a garbage collector and verify correctness with valgrind. You do have to diligently manage memory, or any language that assumes GC may win in the long run. Speed, however, was never a goal of C. You could argue the same thing with assembly, if you do all of the hard work yourself the result can be faster and more efficient than the same application in C. Neither was <i>meant</i> to be fast or efficient on its own, but may be considered as such when compared to higher level languages.<p>> There is a JVM for mips isn&#x27;t there?<p>It exists, but it&#x27;s proprietary.<p>> Or don&#x27;t you have enough memory?<p>Not by a long shot, usually.<p>> JVM languages uses alot more memory than a native program, that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make JVM-based languages any less portable.<p>Not on principle, but in practise it does.<p>> The same .jar file can be executed on Windows, Linux, Mac and more operating systems without a recompile. [...] I&#x27;d argue that they are more portable than C.<p>You simply moved the problem from the program itself to the underlying platform. By that logic, I can prove a PPC binary is portable by running it in qemu on x86. As long as there&#x27;s a PPC or Java bytecode implementation, the hypothetical programs will work. Fact remains that given Java or C <i>source code</i>, the C code will end up being more portable.<p>> Last but not least, it&#x27;s important to use the right tool for the right job. I would never write a VM in a JVM-based language [...] never write a GUI application in C.<p>I absolutely agree with using the right tool for the job, so never say never. Both examples can be perfectly reasonable ways to get a certain job done, we just don&#x27;t see them very often.",1387564247

This misconception is probably as widespread as encryption provides message integrity. One needs to know he&#x27;s talking to the right person, otherwise he&#x27;s vulnerable to some man in the middle.<p>There are many ways to solve this authentication problem. A large number of TLS ciphersuites uses PKI, but there are also ciphersuites using pre-shared key or password such as TLS-PSK or TLS-SRP. PAKE protocols use a password to authenticate each other, e.g., if only Bob could know the password he&#x27;s the only one could finish the protocol with Alice.<p>Recently I&#x27;ve worked on some authenticated key exchange problems not using a password, which could be fun to think about:<p>1) How to build a secure inter-app channel on iOS.<p>2) How to bootstrap keyboard-less devices to password-protected WIFI network.",1387564091

I&#x27;ve been arguing that the idiomatic use of strlcpy is easier to audit than any use of strcpy.<p>> I haven&#x27;t needed to audit code professionally, but when I do it personally, I don&#x27;t look for common pitfalls in function use - I look for general scenarios that are dangerous, like working with potentially tainted data. So when I talk about design security, I don&#x27;t mean what function you use, I mean how it fits into the broader scheme of what the application is trying to do.<p>What you&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t wrong, but looking for common pitfalls is a very easy way to get a baseline assesment of code quality.  You&#x27;d be surprised at the amount of problems you can find just by looking for arithmetic overflows near memory allocation, misuse of realloc, and the string handling functions.  And if the search turns out lots of such problems, trying to understand the design and &quot;broader scheme&quot; is not very useful (at least for me, because at this point I would&#x27;ve decided the software in its current state is simply not good enough for me).<p>There&#x27;s another reason to look for common pitfalls: you have something very concrete to focus on.  You can work mechanically.  You can work with grep.  It really does make a huge difference.  And let&#x27;s not forget: these common pitfalls are common.  And commonly, they are exploitable.  And they are the things many attackers would also initially look for.<p>If you &quot;just look&quot; trying to find potential security issues in design or otherwise, but are not looking for anything very specific, you can&#x27;t be anywhere near as focused, and it will take more time to usefully process the code.  If it takes a lot of time, focus is going to get worse with the degrading attention span.. it&#x27;ll be harder (at least for me) to be certain that the review has actually been thorough and has managed to flag things that need attention.<p>Oh I do look at the broader design of software, but only after getting the low hanging fruit out of the way.",1387563421

It is an inversion of meaning, an inversion of the order, where good becomes bad and bad becomes good. Where kindness is reformulated through the process of the ultimate lie, which is a perversion in the thinking processes. Evil triumphs. It is strong and good. The psychopath has only the machinery of perverse reasoning to use to cogitate reality. Thus he lies not only to others but necessarily lies to himself about himself.<p>Because of this endogenous dishonesty, he is intrinsically incapable of telling the truth. Thus he cannot accurately self-assess. He can never formulate a truthful thought due to this profound mental perversion that is the hallmark of this disorder. He has only acquired more slick, refined and better labguage to dissimulate others as a &quot;treatment success.&quot; Thats why so many of you were duped into feeling empathy for him. He is simply pulling for it in you, but he has no empathy for you. It is all just a game for him. There is nothing genuine about his letter. Feeling empathy for a psychopath is a fools game.

The biggest problem is that the SHA1 digest of a message is not an authenticator of that message, because an attacker can generate the same digest given only the contents of the message.<p>Please note that a message to be encrypted would not only contain the actual text sent, but also at least the server salt, session id, message sequence number, message length and precise time.<p>This complete data set could be theoretically obtainable only from either server or client memory, therefore the fact that an attacker has this kind of data implies that a successful attack had already taken place. Hence the question — why didn&#x27;t that attacker take the auth_key right away?<p>On top of that, the present setup doesn&#x27;t present any identifiable threats, because even if you could get a message with a given SHA1, you would still not know which message was really transmitted out of the possible matching set (or rather out of the 2^(L-160) messages for a message with the length of L bits).<p>Regardless of this fact, we do agree that strengthening this point would be logical in view of possible future developments in code-breaking.

Technical attributes of your RSA usage appear incompetent. RSA padding is not optional; 80% of the RSA implementations on the Internet are insecure because they use the default padding (PCKS1v1.5) which was carefully designed (in the 90s) to resist attacks, but missed some. You use ad-hoc padding.<p>We thanked you for feedback on padding two days ago [2] and noted that we were in the process of strengthening this point by moving to OAEP.<p>Still, the random padding already in use in MTProto is rather robust. The reason for this is that the RSA in DH is only used one way and ONLY with the public key. An attack on the private key would not be possible in this case, since it is not being used for transmission. So the sole possible attack would be MITM, which would imply deciphering RSA in real-time. If you are aware of other attacks that could harm this design, please tell us.<p>For the moment getting the RSA key with a microphone in traditional setups that store private RSA keys on client devices looks like a more real threat than what is described above. In our case private RSA keys are neither stored, nor used on the client.<p>[2] <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6918634\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6918634</a>",1387563327

6942941,comment,6940488,6942155,2,0,X4,,,"I see a recurring pattern in here! We all started seeing mixing markup, style and logic before 2000. Pre 2000 was ruled by functional programming and the decade before was ruled by procedual programming.<p>Then we rapidly started to &quot;encapsulate&quot;, when OOP boomed. Now &quot;packaging&quot; is the main problem every programming language and OS has to solve. Today we end up implementing lightweight packages, so called components and we think it&#x27;s a new idea to use statemachines to keep the interdependent component&#x27;s state coherent. This idea was influenced by the boom of Interpred programming languages. Although 40 years ago, there were programs that only focused on allowing &quot;components&quot;, which were &quot;pluggable&quot; modules back then, to be controlled by the DataFlow Pattern [1].<p>To formalize the main problem of the HTML,CSS and Javascript abstractions, blended into the DOM, we have to recognize that Data (Input) and UI (Output) are bound to States (Data Flows [2]). A solution to these problem is to use the FBP paradigm [3] in the browser engine and to implement the UI as an array of graphs. Usage of vectors allow the use of highly advanced mathematical solutions to be used to apply a optimization much easier than it is possible today, without rewriting the browser engine. For instance creating a UI now just means dragging and dropping items into a pane, which creates a matrix of number sequences that have relations to each other, yes basically a graph.<p>Because the UI and State is deterministic (except for Networks protocols!?), we can use the Knaster–Tarski theorem [4] to solve such DataFlow problems. Using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), we can even get deep level insight into UI & usage patterns that evolve and recur.<p>&quot;Control of the language we use can be used to restrict our thinking. I find that this pattern is proving George Orwell&#x27;s Newspeak [6] is similar to programming languages today.<p>What do I know, so please correct me when you think that there is no such pattern, or when you think something is wrong in what I said. So that others will profit from it.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow-based_programming</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knaster%E2%80%93Tarski_theorem\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knaster%E2%80%93Tarski_theorem</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_b...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newspeak</a>",1387563214

By definition, a pure psychopath feels absolutely no remorse, no guilt, and has an unshakable egocentric view that does not change. They&#x27;re effectively intelligent rational agents without the natural mammal-evolved desire to benefit the group -- they only seek to benefit the self. They would stab you in the back both figuratively and literally without the slightest hesitation or emotional reservation, so long as they know the benefits to them sufficiently outweigh the risks.<p>You can no more teach a psychopath to be caring and empathic than you can teach someone with autism to implicitly understand social context and facial expressions. However, a psychopath will be thrilled to find someone who thinks they can &quot;convert&quot; them, because they can use this to their advantage.<p>On the other hand, I say some people over-demonize psychopaths though because they assume they&#x27;re all on the extreme end of the spectrum and all with the same traits. For example, some autistic people can recognize facial expressions masterfully, but fail at other things. Similarly, not all psychopaths are alike or have the same motivations or methods.<p>If you read my post again, you&#x27;ll note that I am admitting to the possibility that psychopaths can contribute positively to society, but only in as far as society arranges a cost/benefit system where positive contributions are rewarded more than negative ones.<p>However since there is really no scientific evidence a psychopath can truly change, you should not find it unsettling that we hold a non-scientific, subjective, anecdotal, and self-reported essay of change on the part of a psychopath with pessimism and doubt.",1387563047

This becomes problematic when you try to interact with Emacs users unfamiliar with Prelude, because they don&#x27;t have any knowledge of the changes Prelude makes to the environment, some of which result in incompatibilities between Emacs + Prelude and just plain Emacs. (I&#x27;ve run into this when answering Stack Overflow questions, to the extent that if I see a question where the asker mentions using Prelude, and it&#x27;s not immediately obvious that the problem at hand could not possibly be related to Prelude&#x27;s changes, I just pass on by.)<p>On the other hand, if you install a &quot;starter kit&quot; like Prelude and it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work properly, then you&#x27;re pretty much boned, because you have no knowledge of what the misbehavior you&#x27;re seeing signifies, or how to hunt it down and fix it.

I mean, if it&#x27;s chemical/hormonal, it could theoretically fixed that way... and if it&#x27;s not, then it might not be &quot;fixable&quot;, but it&#x27;s not magic either, and layers and layers and layers of defense, redirections and rationalizations are expected. <i>Nobody</i> wants to accept that the center of their pearl is some banal, useless, accidental piece of dirt someone else or the wind put there. But that&#x27;s usually what it is, I think. And pearls can kill, they&#x27;re not pretty at all. They&#x27;re like a scab turned cancer.<p>I agree that considering psychopaths as some spooky &quot;other&quot; is silly, it&#x27;s all a matter of degree, and I guess we only call it psychopathic once it crosses a threshold. That is, I doubt anyone here can claim they <i>never</i> used someone, or calculated more coldly than they let on, or looked down on sentimentality when they didn&#x27;t feel sentimental about a particular thing. Or maybe I&#x27;m projecting, I don&#x27;t know. I know putting others down because I felt crappy, and for me that letter sounds like a much more elaborate and Machiavellian version, but still kinda the same.<p>TL;DR: The thing about the powerful is that they&#x27;re not, that&#x27;s why they need power, and <i>of course</i> the alligator part of the brain gets real good if that&#x27;s all you use. Use your mammal brain to see what a small achievement that really is.",1387562766

6942874,comment,6941622,6942637,4,0,actsasbuffoon,,,"Emacs is extremely extensible. Some people use it as-is out of the box and are happy with it, others treat it more like a framework for creating text editors.<p>Sublime has plugins, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to the Emacs ecosystem. I can edit code in one pane, manage my git repository in another, have a terminal to run tests in a third pane, chat with a co-worker with Jabber in another, and look up documentation in a browser (w3m) in yet another pane. The merge conflict resolution capabilities in Emacs are also pretty excellent. I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re at least on par with Vim&#x27;s excellent Fugitive plugin.<p>Org mode is a thing of beauty. You can write notes (and enable spell checking in the buffer), create TODO lists, spreadsheets, calendars, handle time tracking, and even embed executable snippets from various languages. The coolest Org mode story I&#x27;ve heard is about Avdi Grimm. He wrote a Ruby book in Org mode and embedded his code right in it. With a single Emacs command he could extract the code from the book and run specs against it, and also package the whole thing up as an ebook.<p>The learning curve doesn&#x27;t have to be as brutal as depicted in the blog post. I&#x27;ve only been using Emacs for 4-5 months, and I&#x27;m already very efficient with it. I&#x27;ve changed a lot of the keybindings to match what I&#x27;m already familiar with, so I didn&#x27;t learn Emacs as much as I made Emacs learn me.<p>I used Sublime for years before my switch to Emacs (with a 3 month layover in Vim Land). Sublime is really easy to use, and I still recommend it for designers who write a bit of code, people new to programming, and people who just aren&#x27;t interested in learning new tools. That said, I spend 90% of my time writing code, and it&#x27;s great to have an editor that can trivially be made to do whatever I want it to.",1387562572

Through measures like Section 8, which often pays for low-income families to live in nicer neighborhoods, urban schools in wealthier areas can be 10-20% low-income. Parents will tolerate that.

You should switch!&quot; The effect is almost always what it&#x27;s been in your case: someone looks at the list, says &quot;My God, it takes <i>that</i> much to make Emacs usable?&quot;, and resolves afresh never to touch Emacs with a ten-foot pole.<p>This is especially true in the case of a Vim user, because, unlike most editors (Sublime Text especially), Vim is roughly comparable with Emacs in terms of raw editing power. Each is about as powerful as the other, in most respects, and each has borrowed concepts from the other over time -- some Emacs modes are &quot;modeful&quot; in the Vim sense, in that you might, for example, press &#x27;e&#x27; to enable editing in an Occur (regexp search across file) results buffer, and C-c C-c (control-C twice) to switch back to browsing mode; in the other direction, I hear Vim has windows now, as well as buffers.<p>The difference between Emacs and Vim isn&#x27;t so much one of basic capability as of perspective on the world; Vim is (more or less) the quintessential Unix editor, very lightweight and deriving most of its power from the broad range of tools provided by the platform. Emacs, on the other hand, is more or less a virtual Lisp machine with a text editor built on top of it, and while many of its capabilities work in concert with external programs, it is as much as possible designed to behave independently of whatever platform it happens to be running on. The cavil that &quot;Emacs is a great operating system which just needs a good text editor&quot; is, as with many cavils, not entirely devoid of truth; rms has I think never stopped grieving for the MIT AI Lab and its Lisp machines, and a lot of the early design decisions that went into GNU Emacs were driven, I think, by a desire that it should offer at least a broadly similar environment -- turning a Unix box into a Lisp machine in spite of itself, if you will. (After a few years using Emacs, I can understand what makes that a desirable result, too.)<p>But, overall, either editor can do anything the other can, to the extent that the editor war has no clear winner; if you use the tools you&#x27;re comfortable with, and get as good at using them as you can, then it&#x27;s hard to go too far wrong.<p>On the other hand: Emacs has Tramp, which is far and away the best tool available for transparent remote editing. If you can get to a file by any means more immediate than emailing it back and forth, you can open it in Emacs, edit it, and write it back, with only as much additional effort as is required to identify the host and authenticate for whatever protocol exposes the file. And, unlike FUSE, it works identically on every platform where Emacs itself compiles, which matters to me because I use all of Linux, OS X, and Windows, for both work and play.<p>Better still, Tramp ties into Emacs&#x27; built-in shell, so that you can, for example, &#x27;cd /host:/path/to/some/directory&#x27; and run shell commands there, copy files back and forth between local and remote directories or from one remote host to another, so forth and so on, and have everything behave exactly as you&#x27;d expect. For someone like me, who spent years sshing hither and yon, opening another xterm to scp something across without having to drop a remote shell, et cetera and so forth, Tramp, and especially Tramp + Eshell, amounts to a revelation. I&#x27;d never used anything like it; I&#x27;d never imagined anything close.<p>If what you&#x27;re using right now satisfies your needs, then I wouldn&#x27;t recommend Tramp and Eshell as a reason to switch. But if your needs change, to a point where what you&#x27;re using right now can&#x27;t live up to them, it&#x27;s an option worth keeping in mind.",1387562523
