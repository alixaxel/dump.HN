6899310,comment,6898680,6899233,2,0,dack,,,"If it&#x27;s the case that there are other existing solutions that are simultaneously as {cheap, nutritious, tasty, storable} as Soylent, then the problem is marketing. I don&#x27;t know about them.<p>If, however, the existing solutions have a major downside (I would assume cost or taste, but could be wrong), then that&#x27;s the reason.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there were existing solutions that just aren&#x27;t catering to the audience of &quot;silicon valley hipster&quot; and therefore simply getting ignored.<p>According to your link on Plumpy nut, it&#x27;s only $60 for 2 months for a child. Even though a 280lb. man certainly needs much more than whatever the amount is for starving children, it still sounds like it would be cheaper than I would normally spend on food even if I just bought groceries and never ate out.  So... could I eat that food for 2 months straight and be perfectly healthy (assuming I have the willpower)?  Could I reasonably use it as a meal replacement whenever I wanted and not have any negative consequences?",1386914380

Sure, you can always vote with your feet, but there are often times when I <i>really like</i> a service, but a certain feature, or a certain decision really irks me. In this case, using google shopping increases OP&#x27;s revenue, which is great, but the &quot;don&#x27;t watermark your images&quot; rule means losing out on one part of their competitive advantage (i.e. having the best product pictures which show exactly what the customer wants/needs to see).<p>The answer isn&#x27;t to stop using Google Shopping, and the answer isn&#x27;t to &#x27;put up or shut up&#x27;.

Those who don&#x27;t accept any DRM go to GOG first, since they are strictly DRM free. And many of those are Linux users.<p>GOG aren&#x27;t focused on old games specifically anymore (even though they keep working on digging up more of them). They are focused on Good DRM free games, be it AAA, indie or what not. The problem is that most big budget games are funded by legacy backward thinking publishers who are afflicted with DRM sickness. That&#x27;s why Steam has way more of such games. But crowdfunding and independent studios are really growing lately, and more and more big budget DRM free games emerge.",1386913278

In some cultures spitting in public is acceptable so possibly some of these people are immigrants who haven&#x27;t yet learned to fit in. Most will eventually get the message and stop spitting.<p>Urinating in public is a classic sign of people being drunk in public. Most of those people have the money to spend on drinks in bars so I doubt they are homeless.<p>As for taunting, that sounds like mental illness to me. And the same goes if someone is spitting at other people.<p>Now I will admit that it is a common side effect of mental illness to be homeless, but unless you actually know that someone is homeless for a fact, you are likely lumping multiple groups of people together and basically saying &quot;This city needs to do something about all the people on the streets who are not like me&quot;.<p>Seems to me like better support for the mentally ill would go a long way to solve the problem, and for those who just want to sweep the problem away by moving the mentally ill somewhere else, that might be a good idea. Bringing people closer to nature in a country setting and giving them responsibility to care for farm animals, and gardens, are all known ways to heal mental illness. Sounds like these people need to put their money where there mouth is.

First, I should be clear that I&#x27;m not trying to argue with you or convince you of anything. I just want to understand what people are thinking.<p>Bearing that in mind, would you be so kind as to read on while I make the &quot;Dr. Spock&quot; case against Soylent?<p>Scientifically, the questions about human nutritional requirements you alluded to were largely answered 70 years ago by British government researchers.  They put volunteers on controlled diets, with varying quantities of different micro-nutrients, and studied the effects carefully.  It&#x27;s thanks to their work that Britain avoided mass malnutrition during the war.<p>As a nutritionist, Rob Rhinehart isn&#x27;t fit to hold a clipboard for those pioneers. What kind of incompetent neglects to add iron to his initial formulation?<p>And there&#x27;s plenty of precedent for these kinds of nutritionally balanced rations, usually developed for military or medical purposes. E.g. check out <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumpy&#x27;nut\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumpy&#x27;nut</a>. If I were to make my own Soylent, I&#x27;d probably use that as my starting point: it&#x27;s cheaper and better tasting that Rhinehart&#x27;s formulation. I don&#x27;t see anyone getting excited over those.<p>So ... that&#x27;s the &quot;Dr. Spock&quot; argument. But Dr. Spock wouldn&#x27;t buy a Rolex, or get a tattoo either, and yet people do.<p>Whatever the case is for investing in Soylent, it&#x27;s not rational. It&#x27;s about your emotions, or it&#x27;s a status symbol, or a it&#x27;s statement of identity. Something fuzzy and humanistic.<p>But what? What is it? I truly don&#x27;t get it.
