One striking thing, given recent relevations, was the role of the NSA - Stoll had slight counterculture suspicions of what they were capable of, but generally they were treated as trustworthy security experts. This line - when Stoll hears about a vulnerability in VMS 4.5 - is especially funny in retrospect:<p>&quot;Wait a second. That operating system was certified by NSA.

In regards to crypto, I value his opinion highly, especially compared to my own novice opinion.<p>That said, I seldom trust anything I cannot verify.  In matter s of crypto, that often means that I accept some things as magically working, and accept that the magic could wear off at any minute.  Same thing with CPUs.  I know generally how they work, and understand bitwise logic, but for the most part, they&#x27;re just magic boxes that I&#x27;ve got enough experience with to have an expectation of.<p>In matters of the government, the fault I find with tptacek&#x27;s arguments (and I hadn&#x27;t even realized that it was a thing until this thread, but now I&#x27;m caught up) is that I think it is naive to trust the government.  The federal government is something that our founding fathers encouraged us to be suspicious of.  They specifically prescribed that, in order for our democracy to thrive, that we should be ever vigilant in regards to those we entrust with power.<p>Assuming good faith on the part of the NSA is naive, whether or not they&#x27;re acting scandalously.  Assuming good faith on the part of any politician is naive.<p>That isn&#x27;t to suggest that we should never trust anything the government does, but if there&#x27;s ever the potential for abuse, we should expect that potential to be abused at some point.  If there&#x27;s a loophole that could be exploited in any way, we should expect that it will be.<p>This diatribe isn&#x27;t really directed at this comment, per se, but at your &quot;have to trust __something__&quot; comment, which I completely agree with as a generality.  As humans, we routinely put trust into a great deal of people and things all the time, but I disagree that a government, even a pristine, flawless, immaculate government, is deserving of that trust, and it is our duty as citizens to thoroughly distrust it.",1387590419

This is the default assumption.<p>However, now that the U.S. government, and the NSA and its collaborators in particular, have been <i>shown</i> to explicitly <i>not</i> have this goal – in fact, their goal has been to strive for <i>less</i> secure systems and <i>more difficult</i> standards \u00AD– what should be done?  The logical thing to do is to exclude any person or organization revealed to have an agenda explicitly contrary to the group.<p>The same argument could be made (and has been made many times in the past) for Microsoft to be excluded from any and all standardization committees like ISO, IEEE, IETF, etc. for the same reason – their repeated practice of Embrace, Extend & Extinguish among other things shows them to have an agenda contrary to the group, and their participation would therefore be a detriment, not an asset.",1387590263

6945297,comment,6936672,6945133,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"First of all: One very viable option in science is to say that we don&#x27;t know. If we don&#x27;t know, we simply don&#x27;t know, there is no point in making stuff up. That does not mean that people might not form hypotheses as a first step to eliminating that lack of knowledge, but as long as we don&#x27;t have some serious evidence, it&#x27;s just a hypothesis, not a claim of knowledge, and we continue to simply not know, even if we might be speculating wildly as to what the explanation might be, and in some cases it might be that we never will know, and that is perfectly fine.<p>In this context you should also note that simply positing an intelligent designer does not actually gain you anything. Explanations can be recognized by their ability to predict future observations. Positing an intelligent designer does not allow you to make any predictions whatsoever. There is nothing necessarily fundamentally wrong with positing an intelligent designer - it&#x27;s just not an explanation - so, if you want to have an explanation, you are still on square one. You essentially just have given the thing you lack knowledge about a name, namely &quot;intelligent designer&quot;, but you haven&#x27;t gained any knowledge about it.<p>As for your sand castle example: Well, I don&#x27;t really have a clue how a geologist or an archeologist would go about that, but presumably one could try and determine the structure of the castle, such as the form of the grains, and how they stick together, and find other instances of similar structure to try and figure out what kinds of processes might be able to form such a structure? But as always: When in doubt, we simply don&#x27;t know.<p>Also, I smell the Boeing from the junkyard argument for creationism. In case I am right there, you urgently should educate yourself about what natural selection is and in particular how natural selection is not random, and how evolution without natural selection would not work.",1387589788

The reason why we stick to things like encrypt-then-HMAC, rather than rolling our own protocol, is that they HAVE been PROVEN secure. There are rigorous proofs [1,2] that HMAC and encrypt-then-HMAC are secure, assuming the underlying primitive is secure.
