6913582,comment,6913396,6913396,3,0,letterfly,,,"Let me be brutally honest, because I think this gives you a clear POV on this. I think if you would have invested the time you put into this website and the surveys into some good cause or a smart idea that produces only a(nother?) single line in the newspaper, you would send a much stronger signal than what you have now. Especially MIT is a place that asks for people who do things, not those who do use the megaphone (mens to manus). I believe you might be a smart person and have ambitious goals but the approach might just not fit to the institution you aspire.<p>The main questions that remain unanswered to me are:\n1. What does the website serve for?\n2. What has he achieved so far? (entrepreneurship record, projects etc.)\n3. Where has he been a decision maker?\n4. What professional recommendations does the person have? (And how biased are they?)\n5. Social impact?\n6. REASON WHY? (Being at MIT to be at MIT?)<p>Whatever I missed in the first five points, you really need to fix #6. It is the far most important.<p>Among the answers by your friends, there is nothing really tangible. So far, it is just a collection of adjectives. It reads like you are a nice person but the special something is missing. Imagine you just had an interview at Sloan and there were likely around 30 others like you. How do you make sure to get reminded by the interviewers and how?<p>&quot;The guy with the friend survey&quot;, &quot;the data-driven decision maker&quot; or &quot;the one with the family&quot; is not likely to give you a signature move.<p>I&#x27;d say give yourself some time and start something else; develop yourself. Don&#x27;t expect MIT to polish a raw diamond. Also, don&#x27;t forget that business experience, professional recommendations etc play a much more important role as any friend-recommendation. Further, I have worked with many MIT people and institutions in the past and what I can say is that it might be one of the places where many people who have bright ideas and great backgrounds are still interested to stay low and humble. They don&#x27;t necessarily search for attention. I might be corrected by MIT people that this perspective is totally wrong, but that was my experience in about 8 years.<p>@auctiontheory. &quot;It&#x27;s pretty clear that the two best B-schools to get you ahead in life are HBS and Stanford GSB.&quot;.

Dist-upgrade is one of those things that &quot;should work&quot; of it&#x27;s own accord, but there are ways of increasing the odds; I have found a pre-&quot;dist-upgrade&quot; upgrade is one. (Sometimes I&#x27;m impatient and only upgrade apt/aptitude before a dist-upgrade though.)<p>I would say it makes more of a difference on systems that are infrequently upgraded in general since a few points away from the current versions aren&#x27;t going to contain many differences anyways, but I&#x27;d certainly be more hesitant to dist-upgrade from a .0 release (6.0 to 7.x, for example). I&#x27;d almost rather clean-install in that scenario since it amounts to a similarly-sized download.",1387182934

Only to find I have to pick myself up and throw in another 5-6 hours. Add to this stress when things don&#x27;t workout,an occasional bad day and occasions when I have to face failure after days of work. Plus I have a family to which I have to tend to. Often they feel I&#x27;m just not spending time with them.<p>I completely agree that currently I&#x27;m in some sort of tiring march. I&#x27;m tired already. I see wins rarely, but continue to put in record efforts. On the other hand, I see the only reason I&#x27;m doing this is because.<p><pre><code>    a. To some extent I enjoy what I&#x27;m doing.\n    b. I want the money.\n    c. I see I&#x27;m literally getting addicted to it.\n    d. If I don&#x27;t put such efforts, I feel guilty\n       that I might just be getting lazy, or\n       under performing.\n    e.

Smart people eventually realize achieving something big demands hard sacrifices.<p>I also see many other smart successful people putting ridiculous efforts day in and out to win. And its in every profession. Whether its sports, medicine, software, hardware etc.<p>I feel at the end of the day, its just like a rubber band. You can stretch until it breaks. Some people just practice it stretching enough number of times to keep the breaking point a little high.

A few months before I made the decision to take time off, I tried freelancing and gave myself a goal - if I could consistently make $X/month, then I would take a year off and work full time on freelancing to explore my options. Although this sentence could be an entire book, the short story is that I hit that goal and even started writing a book & building an audience^1.<p>Anyway, I decided to take the 1-year-long leave and start freelancing/writing full time. I quickly learned two things: The first is that I love to learn. The second is that learning from quality sources can be free or extremely cheap. Since college, the only direct payment I make for my education is $9/month to TeamTreehouse. Through things like TeamTreehouse, building clients&#x27; and personal projects, I&#x27;ve taken my skill level of creating iOS apps from beginner to advanced, which helped me increase freelancing income and gave me the knowledge to write a book.<p>In short, freelancing will allow you to learn more about a technology you&#x27;re interested in, learn about building a business, make some kind of income, and hopefully connect you with some cool people and opportunities.<p>^1: I wrote a whole post about how I got into freelancing and writing a book on my website, but the main point is that you should start by building a small portfolio of projects and target businesses (especially local) that have money to spend. Freelancing/consulting is a science, and you can start making a decent amount of money relatively quickly if done right.",1387181830

In theory only using &quot;upgrade&quot; is supposed to be safer (eg more unlikely to break something) but I have not encountered any problems when using dist-upgrade (disclaimer: when you rely on the standard distro repositories; if you use unstable programs/repos or 3rd party repos/PPAs in Ubuntu, it is more likely that dist-upgrade breaks something).<p>But I do not agree with what ksdkkdddd said. There is not really a use to do upgrade and then dist-upgrade right after it, because upgrade doesn&#x27;t magically fix something in case dist-upgrade breaks something. It works or it does not.
