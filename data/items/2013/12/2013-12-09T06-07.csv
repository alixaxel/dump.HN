There are things that you believe or feel about certain things that you will never post. These omissions equate to a lack of honesty (you are not voicing your full opinions)<p>The internet is one of the last places where people can say what they feel. Sure some are jerks about things but these people are just being honest. They really are jerks. They might hold it all inside when offline but this is because of sensitivity conditioning and political correctness. These things only hide the true problems of our society. Do you think that because racism is repressed by PC and an agenda of a few in places of power to impose swift public embarrassment and isolation those honest enough to express their opinion that it does not exist?<p>If anything, this exacerbates the problem. It is funny that many want to legalize drugs so that those with drug problems can come forward and receive help without being demonized, yet those same people just want people dealing with hatred and bigotry problems just to keep it inside until it eats them (and their lineage) alive.<p>><i>2.

They lasted a semester or two, we watched a movie called &quot;The Lottery&quot; where a village picked from a lottery to stone one person (I can&#x27;t remember why, a good harvest I am not sure) but a mother was chosen and it was so ingrained in the children to stone the person her own children looked forward to the stoning and the mother tried to get the children to think &quot;hey this is my own mother&quot;.  Another lesson was the poem about when you let bad things happen to others, when bad things happen to you there will be no one left to speak up on your behalf (can&#x27;t remember the title), and the third one was on cultural understanding if someone hundreds of years from now examines your house and get what is inside of it &quot;wrong&quot; (like assuming the toilet is a communication device you yell into, or toothbrushes (with hooks) were ear-rings) not to think badly of those people (and as such you may make the same mistakes when look at the lives of people you&#x27;re not familiar with).",1386571869

At the time I ended up moving to Python instead.<p>Recently, I&#x27;ve started using Clojure and think it&#x27;ll rapidly become my go-to language (actually wrote about why just yesterday[1]).<p>TL;DR is that I went looking for a faster alternative to Ruby, tried Go, ended up happy with Clojure for being dynamic, fast and functional.<p>In the past I suppose the least common language I ended up with was TCL, about 9-10 years ago. The reason was that I wanted to develop a GUI application, but my attempts to learn GTK or Qt or Swing natively proved too complicated for me at the time. There was in fact a great TCL wrapper for GTK that turned out to be really easy to use.<p>I ended up using TCL for several years and still have a fond memory of it. The coolest feature I remembered was being able to package up TCL into native, distributable packages - <i>Starpacks</i>[2] - complete with libraries, interpreter and app code in a single binary. Around 2000, this was amazing to me, and I was stunned more people weren&#x27;t using it. I suspect one of the main things holding TCL back was in fact their lagging GUI support at the time. Mention TCL and people would wince at their memories of using Tk GUI apps.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://hackworth.be/arriving-at-clojure/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://hackworth.be/arriving-at-clojure/</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://wiki.tcl.tk/3663\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://wiki.tcl.tk/3663</a>",1386569287

This article and the many others like it are full of poorly substantiated hype.<p>Yes, quantum mechanics is important to some biological processes. But (1) many physicists in this field have blatantly ignored vital chemical and biological details when constructing their models and (2) it&#x27;s not entirely clear who should be &quot;surprised&quot; by this sort of quantum entanglement, which is not that different from standard notions of chemical bonds.<p>Also note that this news piece is actually from 2010, and the preprint article it refers to (<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4053\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4053</a>) was never published in a peer-reviewed journal -- presumably because the authors couldn&#x27;t get it past peer review.",1386569046

Often doctors will prescribe the new drug to help patients save money: the insurance company doesn&#x27;t yet realize it&#x27;s the same as the cheap generic, and will pay the full cost for you because it&#x27;s the only drug in its class available.  (Buying the over-the-counter drug, you have to pay 100% of its cost from your taxable income, instead of paying $7 from your tax-free income.  Then again, given a year&#x27;s supply of generic Zyrtec is like $20 on Amazon... you&#x27;d have to have a pretty high tax rate for that to make sense.)<p>Obviously, insurers have wised up to this scheme with the &quot;new&quot; allergy drugs, but in other cases, it can be helpful.",1386568827
