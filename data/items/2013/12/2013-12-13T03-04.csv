One nonfiction book, which I think someone on HN told me isn&#x27;t even the best book on its specific topic, was very meaningful to me and helped me learn a lot about myself. I read the entire book out loud to my dad when he was paralyzed, about three years after his paralyzing accident (which was about three years before he died). The book is <i>The Endurance: Shackleton&#x27;s Legendary Antarctic Expedition,</i>[1] entirely nonfiction, but nonetheless a way to be transported into an earlier time and a place that I am unlikely ever to see in my lifetime. The characters were all real, but they all got me thinking about how I think and about how I get along in life. Great nonfiction can can provide more information about the world, humanity in general, and what&#x27;s even more important, yourself, then you can ever glimpse by reading another science-fiction novel.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Endurance-Shackletons-Legendary-Antarctic-Expedition-ebook/dp/B001O1O6PE/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Endurance-Shackletons-Legendary-Antarc...</a>",1386907022

I think that&#x27;s how Heroku really emerged in the scene, AWS gave you the ability to scale but didn&#x27;t make it easy by any means (relative to &#x27;heroku scale web n&#x27;). I doubt billing was the issue either considering tools for billing monitoring and email warnings have been in place for a while. My guess is that things that don&#x27;t scale easily (db, workers, etc) which, are what most EC2 is used for, have to be scaled with an API and consequently that unprioritized webserver type autoscaling.",1386906970

While the necessity for the non-technically inclined are pretty obvious, auto-scaling shouldn&#x27;t usually be done reactively, and doing so is at the expense of optimal service delivery.<p>That said, I can imagine a good number of times it could come in handy, even for the techiest of us.<p>It might have simply not been the lowest hanging fruit, and the one thing I keep noticing that with AWS is that there are only two types of features they roll out -- new SKUs (e.g., something new that they can charge money for) and services that they should have written a long time ago, but probably didn&#x27;t, because they were too busy launching new SKUs.",1386906802

But as far as I remember &#x27;Setting goals&#x27; by and large works like premature optimization or at most in the theme of water fall model.<p>When we used that approach we found half way down the goal timeline, our priorities as dictated by the business totally changed. We discovered better ways of doing things which altered goals. Some times we found we were simply measuring the wrong things. Some higher priority stuff just preempts the existing business goals and tend to get abandoned etc etc.<p>I can see how it may work for business folks.

Fiction can intentionally or unintentionally invite readers to draw universal lessons which are misleading.<p>I&#x27;d even suggest that some authors, particularly those with strong political views, may be motivated to write fiction in order to give support to their own ideas. It&#x27;s a blank canvas onto which to project an idealized world, and to fulfill wishes. (If that&#x27;s the case, it can serve as a mildly negative Bayesian signal about whether the ideas are really true. If there were so many real-world examples illustrating the beliefs, why would the author be moved to write fiction to promote them?)<p>Apart from politics, plots are more interesting when they&#x27;re surprising, but almost by definition, surprising plots are less likely to be generalizable to the world.<p>(Of course, non-fiction can really be fiction in disguise, but at least non-fiction can be fact-checked. To cite a recent Hollywood example, wherever the movie Argo is suspenseful, it&#x27;s simply made up. Minor spoiler: If you drew a lesson about how going directly against the instructions of both the President and your CIA boss can be a useful tool to cause your boss to suddenly rally around you and later commend your success, you would be gravely misled.
