6868748,comment,6868303,6868509,7,0,jfarmer,,,"First, if you can handle it, I recommend the original paper proposing monads as a solution for a wide variety of problems that every functional language has to face: <a href=\"http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/baastad.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/marktoberdorf/ba...</a><p>IMO, you have to understand the problems monads were meant to solve before you can understand why monads are a good solution.<p>Here was one key to my understanding monads. In a purely functional language you want everything to be referentially transparent. That is, an expression should be able to be substituted for its value at any given moment in time. At the very least, you&#x27;ll want the ability to denote which parts of your program are referentially transparent and which aren&#x27;t.<p>This can be expressed as utopian vision: in a purely functional language we&#x27;d like everything — <i>everything</i> — to be a value.<p>We now need some way of translating code with side effects into code that returns a value. One reasonable abstraction is to say that the &quot;value&quot; is not the work itself — once the work is done it&#x27;s out of the bag, after all — but rather the &quot;value&quot; is the machine which can perform that work.<p>To a mathematician this screams &quot;functor.&quot; If you want to move between the two spaces repeatedly this screams &quot;adjoint functors.&quot; There&#x27;s some work you want to do in Space A that&#x27;s more easily expressed in Space B, so you take a thing in A, transform it to a thing in B, do the work in B, and then transform back to A.<p>Think in, e.g., Ruby:\n    sentence.split(&#x27; &#x27;).map(&:reverse).join(&#x27; &#x27;)<p>split(&#x27; &#x27;) and join(&#x27; &#x27;) aren&#x27;t quite inverses of each other, but they are adjoint. These pairs take us from the land of space-separated strings to the land of arrays back to the land of space separated strings.<p>You see that all the time in programming and mathematics. I sometimes call it the &quot;Super Mario Brothers&quot; maneuver when I&#x27;m trying to teach it to students. Mario wants to get to the end of the level, so he hits a block, goes up the vine to cloud land, runs through cloud land, and then comes back down.<p>This is a bit hand-wavey, but it&#x27;s &quot;morally correct&quot; IMO.  I mention functors because I&#x27;m hoping you&#x27;ve seen the maneuver I&#x27;m describing and monads are a special type of functor.",1386470353

They really try and convince you that a four year university is the only option.<p>(I go to a very affluent, competitive HS.

There is more to life than a good salary and a secure job.<p>That said, I dislike how much the bubble around here paints the choice as a dichotomy: do a startup right after school or be a slave to Big Corps forever.<p>The VC world likes em young, and that&#x27;s fine for them. But statistically, founders of such companies probably don&#x27;t come out ahead, financially, relative to those who pursue say an MBA and a big corp job. However, there are a lot of people who take the experience and contacts from Big Corps to start a business. Both companies where I worked as an engineer were founded by guys in their late 30&#x27;s or early 40&#x27;s after developing a base of experience in industry. They had revenue from almost day one, they had the experience to identify niches that could make them money.

Having to earn lots of money and working really hard is something that the system has pushed (or tried to push) into our brains since a very early age. But in reality, it means nothing at all. What is meaningful and will make you happy is giving to others and spending your time doing so. Now giving can be a lot of things... it can be giving someone a tool to make their life easier, it can be helping someone cross the street, it can be visiting your family, etc.<p>If you make it to an age of 80 or 90 and look back, you will feel a lot happier and accomplished if you did a lot of those things in the time you had on this planet.

6868725,comment,6868303,6868509,4,0,thetwiceler,,,"Because monads are abstract, and very general, there turn out to be many different ways to think of monads, and each of the perspectives is enlightening in its own way. In fact, really the ONLY thing that monads provide is an abstraction for many concepts that you probably are already familiar with. In Haskell, the Monad type class simply allows you to use the same syntax for these different operations.<p>In other programming languages, I&#x27;m sure you already use the very same functions that are fundamental to monads; you just don&#x27;t have a syntactic construct that says &quot;Hey, these things share a similar structure!&quot;<p>Most of the other replies focus on IO (and on the do-notation side of things), and so I&#x27;m not sure that they&#x27;ll help your confusion.<p>We&#x27;ll need to start with functors. Without getting too formal, functors describe &quot;containers&quot; that can hold objects of any type. A list is a functor, a &quot;Maybe&quot; is a functor, the result of a computation (i.e., &quot;IO&quot;) is a functor… lots of things are functors!<p>And since functors can contain anything, they can certainly recursively contain themselves - that is, they can be nested! We can have a list of lists, or a &quot;Maybe (Maybe a)&quot; (hey,… that seems like an awfully redundant thing to construct). When we talk about &quot;IO&quot;, we can have an &quot;IO (IO a)&quot;: that is, we can describe a computation that returns to us another computation!<p>And with these functors that I&#x27;ve mentioned, we realize something interesting: We would often like to flatten these nested structures. We use &quot;concat&quot; to reduce a list of lists to just a list; how to reduce a &quot;Maybe (Maybe a)&quot; to a &quot;Maybe a&quot; is obvious; for IO, we might want to take our description of a computation that returns a description of another computation (&quot;IO (IO a)&quot;) and convert that into a description of a computation that runs the first computation, and upon receiving the result of that computation (which is a computation itself), run the resulting computation, and then return the result of THAT as our final result.<p>Also, for these things, we have an idea of how we would inject a pure value into the structure. We can create a list with a singleton element, or &quot;Just&quot; our element, or the computation that does nothing interesting (no missile launches) and just returns our element.<p>Haskell is just wacky enough to let us use the same syntax for all of these rather different ideas (which only share the similarity of having the monadic structure)!<p>NOW, I personally don&#x27;t think that the trouble that people have with monads is related to the abstraction and the shared syntax - I think it has more to do with the use of the use of Haskell&#x27;s &quot;do&quot; notation. Learn what &quot;do&quot; notation is sugar for! Learn what &quot;bind&quot; (>>=) is (it&#x27;s basically a neat combination of the two operations (&quot;bind&quot; and &quot;return&quot;, for what it&#x27;s worth) that I described above).<p>I can&#x27;t promise you that learning monads is something necessarily pragmatic (except for the fact that I think Haskell is the perhaps the MOST pragmatic language, and you&#x27;ll need to learn monads to be comfortable with Haskell). But the world would be a pretty dull place if we only did what was pragmatic.",1386469505

They pop up in lots of places in programming, but you might not notice them at first because most languages have a way around them.  They&#x27;re more explicit in Haskell because the type system is powerful enough to make them both explicit and easy to use, via the combination of parametric polymorphism and type classes.<p>Here are some examples of monads:<p><pre><code>  * Option types (sometimes called nullable types).\n  * Many kinds of collections: lists, arrays, trees (but not sets, strictly speaking, because some invariants don&#x27;t hold when treating sets as monads).\n  * Types with logging attached (Writer monads).\n  * Continuations.\n</code></pre>\nFurthermore, Haskell&#x27;s list comprehensions can be thought of as syntactic sugar for monadic operations, in addition to the usual do notation.<p>Monads are useful because they let you add context to normal values -- any context you want, really.  Often, the context just gets called &quot;state&quot;,  but lots of things are state, really.  The monad operations are also useful because they allow you to force a sequence of execution, which is partly why they&#x27;re also so useful for performing IO:  Haskell is designed so that the compiler may re-order operations when it makes sense, and bind lets programmers place a sequential order on parts of the code.  This is why the &quot;pipeline&quot; analogy is sometimes used.<p>An excellent article on monads is &quot;You Could Have Invented Monads&quot;, which guides you through discovering several different monads using practical problems: <a href=\"http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monads-and.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.sigfpe.com/2006/08/you-could-have-invented-monad...</a><p>As for pg, monads don&#x27;t pop up too often in untyped languages.

6868680,comment,6868580,6868580,3,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Six months ago I created an e-mail course for teams that are using Agile, Scrum, Lean, and Kanban. I called it the &quot;Agile Tune-Up Kit&quot; (shameless plug: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/15sz0Pl\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bit.ly/15sz0Pl</a>)<p>Man that was/is a freaking lot of work. Over 30 mini-classes so far. People get one each week. When people sign-up, I ask them for comments, and I hand-reply back to why they&#x27;re there. When people unsub from the list, I apologize and ask what I could have done better.<p>I am learning this lesson, but very slowly. Whenever somebody unsubs from the list, I always look at what the last email they got was. Can I make it better? Am I writing the series too long/too short/wrong reading level/to the wrong audience? It&#x27;s enough to drive you nuts.<p>But it&#x27;s been a great lesson, because with any email list, you&#x27;re naturally going to lose people. It actually doesn&#x27;t have to have anything to do with what you&#x27;re creating. Maybe they don&#x27;t have time to read it any more, or their job changed, or they just clicked on the spam button on Gmail because they had too much stuff in their inbox. Yes, it <i>might</i> be something I can control. Or it might not. All I can do is do the best job I can, ask for feedback, and move on.<p>Every second and every bit of emotional energy I spend worrying about what I can&#x27;t control is taking away from the things I can control. Creating things and interacting with people ain&#x27;t like programming. Things aren&#x27;t boolean, there are tons of hidden variables, and &quot;debugging&quot; doesn&#x27;t work the way it does in code. Tough thing to learn.",1386468419

Yet we still try to arrive at a truth by considering all their opinions equally as a group.  This is obviously doomed to failure.)<p>It&#x27;s even more clear when you think about something more abstract, like a favorite color.  My favorite color is purple.  If yours is yellow, does that mean I&#x27;m wrong?  Clearly there isn&#x27;t an obvious objective &quot;This Is Good&quot; when it comes to taste or opinions.  Why then is up/down arrows the current state of the art?<p>I know Netflix has managed to do more by looking for similar reviewers and weighting their opinions, and Pandora does audio classification, but I&#x27;m not aware of this concept catching on well in other areas, and I particularly don&#x27;t know of it being applied to multiple things at once - if I want a recommendation about a new movie that isn&#x27;t on Netflix yet, or if I&#x27;m tired of the repetitiveness of Pandora&#x27;s stations, their clever algorithms don&#x27;t help me a bit beyond their limited walls.  I don&#x27;t know of a site like reddit or hacker news or videosift trying to capture more than &#x27;good/bad&#x27; for evaluating links on the web.  I don&#x27;t know of a site that is really trying to help me pair my taste with other reviewers, so that I can get personally curated content and we can end up with a world that recognizes some people love action movies and others love romantic comedies and recommending a movie for me to see should take that into account.  How wonderful will it be when there is finally a site that can suggest I should read these three articles because -I- will find them good, maybe I should be sure to catch Pacific Rim, and a new band I might like has a video out; while giving completely different recommendations to my sister, without trying to limit to an objective non-relative definition of &quot;good&quot;, because we&#x27;re talking about taste and opinions aren&#x27;t wrong.<p>When one of you smart folks makes that site, please let me know.",1386468092
