While they solved some useful problems and packaged it nicely, they did so with very little regard for style, performance, or extensibility.<p>The typeahead plugins, both the bootstrap and the larger standalone versions, are hellish to work with or modify in any way. The same goes for dropdown and many others. Unfortunately they never thought that anyone would use these plugins except in their prescribed way - so few to no events are ever thrown, and incoming events are often canceled (stopPropagation, preventDefault), making it hard/impossible to reuse those events for other interactions.<p>I have had to monkey patch bootstrap JS more times than I can count and I generally stay away from it now. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anybody paying much attention to the repos anymore; the number of issues and PRs outstanding for typeahead.js (a small library!) is pretty astounding.<p>FYI, the older versions of bootstrap.typeahead were more performant, but of course did far less than the now standalone typeahead.js does.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, typeahead.js is a nice project and the devs have clearly worked very hard on it. It does some really nice things. But there is clearly some leakage from the twitter style where comments are barebones, assignments take place in conditionals, semicolons are missing, and ~ is a common sight.

6879038,comment,6878994,6878994,5,0,thenerdfiles,,,"Because many African languages, like Zulu, lack many linguistic distinctions sufficient to produce abstract concepts regarding Time (Past/Present) and Rules (Obligation/Promise). So descendents of Africans and people who are closer in proximity to practical use of those languages are seen as lacking subtlety, lacking conceptual grace, less capable of exploratory thought and critical intellectual maneuvering — notwithstanding the Media Machine which primes expectations for cross-racial and cross-cultural interactions.<p>As a Black (and Native American, mind you) person myself, I constantly battle on a personal level with criticisms such as this, and through my own limitations with language. I am but one person. At the same time, I have read from the works of Samuel Beckett to the works of Wittgenstein to Galileo, Aquinas, Maimonides, Aristotle, versed in Spinoza&#x27;s Ethics, trained with a B.A. in Philosophy. And I still find myself each day pitted against the installed social strictures present in all Blacks&#x27; lives; even with my Classical education, I often find myself barking up the wrong tree more often than not.<p>Each day I grapple with my tools, sometimes mystified by my own capacity to become conceptually paralyzed. And this becomes a circle of a vicious nature. Language itself becomes both a fortress blocking acceptance and a prison prohibiting liberation, as constantly, despite whatever linguistic finesse I might muster, it simply falls upon deaf ears.<p>We call this Structural Oppression. It does not disappear over night.<p>One important point MLK made during his campaign is that, and I paraphrase, equality will not exist until Blacks are able to fail at the same rate as Whites. I am quite sure the same goes for women; hence, why Miley Cyrus serves as a Debordian &quot;Spectacle&quot;.<p>Georges Bataille says something I believe is relevant[0]:<p><pre><code>    A man who finds himself among others is irritated \n    because he does not know why he is not one of the others. \n</code></pre>\n[0]: <a href=\"http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/georges-bataille-the-solar-anus\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/georges-bataille-the-...</a>",1386651226

6879024,comment,6878400,6878400,9,0,tokenadult,,,"The Nobel laureate profiled in this article researches biology, and has won the Nobel prize for medicine and physiology. You would hope that research on medicine, of all subjects, would be published in journals that never make mistakes, but Science, arguably the most prestigious journal in the world, definitely published a mistaken article about cell biology quite recently,[1] so we have to wonder how well even the most prestigious journal does peer review of what it publishes. A medical doctor who studies the scientific research process in general thinks that a great many published research findings are probably false,[2] so there have to be greater efforts on the part of scientists to get peer review right, and improve scientific publication practices.<p>From Jelte Wicherts writing in Frontiers of Computational Neuroscience (an open-access journal) comes a set of general suggestions [3] on how to make the peer-review process in scientific publishing more reliable. Wicherts does a lot of research on this issue to try to reduce the number of dubious publications in his main discipline, the psychology of human intelligence.<p>&quot;With the emergence of online publishing, opportunities to maximize transparency of scientific research have grown considerably. However, these possibilities are still only marginally used. We argue for the implementation of (1) peer-reviewed peer review, (2) transparent editorial hierarchies, and (3) online data publication. First, peer-reviewed peer review entails a community-wide review system in which reviews are published online and rated by peers. This ensures accountability of reviewers, thereby increasing academic quality of reviews. Second, reviewers who write many highly regarded reviews may move to higher editorial positions. Third, online publication of data ensures the possibility of independent verification of inferential claims in published papers. This counters statistical errors and overly positive reporting of statistical results. We illustrate the benefits of these strategies by discussing an example in which the classical publication system has gone awry, namely controversial IQ research. We argue that this case would have likely been avoided using more transparent publication practices. We argue that the proposed system leads to better reviews, meritocratic editorial hierarchies, and a higher degree of replicability of statistical analyses.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2010/12/this_paper_should_not_have_been_published.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/201...</a><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencenews.org/node/5635\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.sciencenews.org/node/5635</a><p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/arsenic-life-bacterium-prefers-phosphorus-after-all-1.11520\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nature.com/news/arsenic-life-bacterium-prefers-ph...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal...</a><p><a href=\"http://www.bx.psu.edu/~anton/bioinf1-lectures/mccarthy2008.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.bx.psu.edu/~anton/bioinf1-lectures/mccarthy2008.p...</a><p><a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0003081\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.3389/fncom.2012.00020/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.frontiersin.org/Computational_Neuroscience/10.338...</a>",1386650919

6878977,comment,6876295,6878719,2,0,Cookingboy,,,"A large part of cost of living is driven up by cost of housing. That has historical reasons in the case of California.<p>After the 70s California voters voted against raising property tax, the government had to get most of their revenue from income-tax, thus the highest state income tax in the country. Due to this, California government income fluctuates a lot with the economy (as we saw from 2008-2009), but that&#x27;s a different topic.<p>One thing about property tax law in California is that it&#x27;s calculated based on how much one paid for property, not its current worth.<p>The problem with low property tax is that when combined with federal tax incentive for housing mortgage and a cheap rate, it makes sense to invest in housing, and having the value going up does not punish the home owners like places with higher property taxes or places that calculate property tax based on the current values of the properties.<p>The end result is that existing homeowners in California are very much against new development since they&#x27;ve got a &quot;I&#x27;ve gotten mine, so fuck you&quot; mentality since they want to keep their existing properties valuable, and this is ESPECIALLY true for owners that own multiple properties that can use it for rental.<p>Imagine you bought a few apartment complexes in SF right after the recession back in the 90s, the places would be worth multiple times as much now but your property tax has not gone up, but you can charge $3k for a small one bedroom apartment, then you&#x27;d vote with all your power to make sure new development and new supply for housing is stalled.<p>This is one of the reasons why direct democracy doesn&#x27;t work, since people are very short sighted when voting for important issues that could have long lasting effects. A suggested solution would be lower income tax, but make property tax to be calculated off existing values of properties, thus thwart artificial inflation of property values. Of course things like this will NEVER get passed since no politicians dare to piss off existing homeowners.<p>To be honest, I am personally pessimistic about this state&#x27;s ability to change for the better, a big reason being the state&#x27;s obsession with direct democracy that resulted in many bad policies in the past.",1386649971

Thus the approximation is actually completely unconstrained in the space of paths, that is it <i>can</i> approximate anything. But by that token, the fact that it can approximate a given path explains nothing and the choices that are simple in this system are not necessarily the best choices for the given case, estimating planetary motion.<p>See - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle</a>",1386649966

Plenty of people probably claim that, but I don&#x27;t think many people who <i>actually</i> want kids would decide not to have kids just because of their retirement plans.  There is probably a deeper fundamental lack of a desire for kids hidden in there somewhere.<p>Anyway, I think it is also worth considering how the price of having kids changes as you go up and down the income scale.  Most parents will naturally be inclined to provide the best childhood for their kid that they can.  For most people, this probably means making sure their kids have good nutrition, do well in school, etc.  Parents with more money available to them might start considering additional expenses though, like private tutors, private schools, larger college funds, trust funds, etc.  People with more money will probably spend more money on their kids, so that 50k extra (after taxes) income every year doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean 50k more money for yourself.  If your income increases, you&#x27;ll probably spend more on your kids.

For example:<p>Maths - teaches logic and critical analysis of problems. No one cares if you don&#x27;t remember SOHCAHTOA or the like. If you can think about using knowns to resolve an unknown, you&#x27;ve got the main thrust of maths classes as they stand for non-Engineering, non-Science people.<p>Physical Ed - teaches healthy habits, ideally. No one cares if you remember the rules to field hockey or rugby or learn to run faster. The idea is that you learn/are exposed to healthy exercise habits and (ideally) healthy nutrition/etc. if it includes that too.<p>Music - teaches quite similar stuff to maths, in fact. No one cares if you can&#x27;t re-draw the circle of fifths, however understanding the patterns in music and why they exist (e.g.: why you don&#x27;t tie the 2nd and 3rd beats of the 4/4 time signature) gives you insight in to the mathematical underpinnings of music and lets you appreciate it more to boot. Not to mention playing music engages and assists the brain areas used at maths, problem solving, etc.<p>Art - You learn to understand and appreciate design better. You learn to appreciate culture. No one cares if you can&#x27;t remember what primary colours to blend to produce a certain new colour, but understanding the role of shadows for contrast, or vertical lines in e.g.: paintings of architecture, help you appreciate the world around you.<p>Science - Again like maths, logical intuition and problem solving. e.g.: for physics, no one cares that you can&#x27;t recite the equations of linear motion, but understanding why something goes up and then falls down, intuitively, is a good way to teach critical analysis of problems.<p>The second benefit of all of this is that you then also get exposed to this content, which means you get a general introduction to those fields. As you say, it helps bring the fruit to bear whereby people find out they enjoy/have talent in something, but additionally it means that because you sat through music in school you probably at least understand why some songs sound sad (minor scales) and others sound happy (major scales) so you can appreciate it more.<p>I absolutely agree with you that programming should be in there. Again, it&#x27;s not about learning how to declare variables in python in particular, but rather about the logical underpinnings of code structure and understanding how that all works. The benefit isn&#x27;t going to be that 100% of kids can read some javascript dump and work out why the webpage doesn&#x27;t load properly. It&#x27;ll be that when they&#x27;re sitting down in excel and they&#x27;re trying to assemble that data their boss wants in a particular way, they&#x27;ll be more capable of logically stepping through each component step of the equations required and understanding exactly how it must be built up to produce the result they&#x27;re after.",1386648880

A rifle was seen as part of a citizen&#x27;s duty and contribution to the national defense when the fledgling country consisted of a few states on the Eastern-most shore.  That&#x27;s a far different time given today&#x27;s political climate and the electoral college, the scenario for a charismatic dictator is just about nil.  Canada is not going to invade and USM won&#x27;t suddenly disappear.  Beyond a rifle in wilderness, a pistol is more of a liability in most practical instances.  Someone regularly practiced and cautious may have a tiny marginal benefit in an extreme situation...  But how often do those occur?  Cities are safer than ever.  Worse case the weapon could be used against the owner, or accidentally discharged due to mistake identity: both liabilities.  If a person intentionally chooses to keep a weapon where legal, they better be at the range at least twice a month or it&#x27;s pure irresponsibility.<p>(I&#x27;m both a member of the NRA and SAR.)",1386648775

Democracy failing, and two parties have too much power and in essence it makes no difference because they are the same business party. The nominees are usually just pawns playing a role for personal gain. But it shows that things need to get changed. Best example is that in Georgia you need to fill out 12 pages of paper to vote. They do this to intimidate people who can not read from voting (usually the &#x27;black&#x27; vote) where as in NJ they don&#x27;t do this.
