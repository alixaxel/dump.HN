Someone in the room full of phone answerers will say &quot;oh, I haven&#x27;t made my own personal donation yet...I plan to donate $100.  Can you announce that the next $100 caller will be matched?&quot;  You then get $200 worth of donations that you might have gotten either way, but both parties get to feel great -- one person for having their donation &quot;doubled&quot; and the other person for feeling like they spurred someone else to donate.",1386716395

Fully enclosed (or perhaps 3/4 enclosed) freeways that explode out of the ground, split off to surface streets, and arch up through the sky and around corners.  Well-engineered, rubberized mounting systems and the enclosure mean you only heard the faintest hint of cars rocketing by at speed.  Highways branching to high-capacity, multi-lane surface streets, which further branch into narrow neighborhood streets (similar to an alley in the US) meant that pedestrian traffic was quite safe, and generally well-respected.<p>By contrast, American cities have a couple of arterial freeways, a massive grid of wide-yet-low-capacity surface streets, and neighborhood streets that people speed through in an effort to shave seconds off their commute.  And when they get to work, they park in huge parking lots, instead of stacked parking structures (ideally under the target building itself).<p>American transportation infrastructure is terrible.",1386716189

The fee is usually about half of the fee of a cab. Then there&#x27;s the same for bicycles. The combination of public transport and car-sharing in berlin is awesome, at least in the city center: I go most ways by public transport and then grab a car or bike if I need to. If I really need to travel long distance by car, I get a rental and I&#x27;m coming out ahead financially, even if I throw in the occasional taxi ride because it&#x27;s late and I&#x27;m lazy.

They are not a reliable source to assess how things are in their country of origin, especially not how things are currently. And to lump together Russia and Ukraine and say that things are not getting better, is gross oversimplification. Ukraine has had weak leaders and strong oligarchs since the fall of the Soviet Union. However Russia has had strong leaders (Yeltsin and then Putin) who have consistently pushed back on their oligarchs. In particular Putin has spent most of his leadership period fighting corruption, reigning in oligarchs, and undertaking the perestroika (redevelopment) that Gorbachev was never able to achieve. Things in Russia are getting better while things in Ukraine are getting worse. They are heading in opposite directions and many Ukrainians are aware of this which is why public dissent has been growing there.<p>Being offended at someone&#x27;s assessment of a situation is a political statement. We should not be surprised to hear people making political statements about a political situation. None of this makes one person more right or another one more wrong.<p>Politics is very hard to figure out, and we should all be careful of making oversimplified statements. It&#x27;s not as simple as Ukraine signs an agreement with the EU and then everything is rosy. Neither is it as simple Putin twisting Yanukovitch&#x27;s arm.

Basically gravity, matter and energy are sideffects of information. They are its projections.<p>How does this relate to hologram? Well dots that might appear like two separated dots on the 3D model, could be encoded on the 2D surface as very close. What this explains is &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;. We perceive two entangled electrons as being far away on a reality hologram, when in reality they are close on the fundamental 2D picture of the world.<p>Summary: What we perceive and measure as reality is not what reality fundamentally is.<p>NOTE: This is extremely layman termish and don&#x27;t be too surprised if it&#x27;s wrong.

[1] One key insight is that free parking required by law costs the USA about three times as much as all the money drivers spend on cars and gas plus public subsidies for roads and highways.

First proposed by Gerard &#x27;t Hooft, it was given a precise string-theory interpretation by Leonard Susskind[1] who combined his ideas with previous ones of &#x27;t Hooft and Charles Thorn.[1][2] As pointed out by Raphael Bousso,[3] Thorn observed in 1978 that string theory admits a lower-dimensional description in which gravity emerges from it in what would now be called a holographic way.\nIn a larger sense, the theory suggests that the entire universe can be seen as a two-dimensional information structure &quot;painted&quot; on the cosmological horizon, such that the three dimensions we observe are only an effective description at macroscopic scales and at low energies.&quot;<p>So the analogy is that the field inside the volume can be completely described by some function over the bounding surface of the volume, similar to how the light field captured by a hologram is projected and recorded on a flat glass or film plane. I can visualize that pretty easily, but I don&#x27;t know enough to tie that to some concrete relationship to the fundamental physical forces of the universe.",1386715207

If one throws a hot gas with entropy into a black hole, once it crosses the event horizon, the entropy would disappear. The random properties of the gas would no longer be seen once the black hole had absorbed the gas and settled down. The second law can only be salvaged if black holes are in fact random objects, with an enormous entropy whose increase is greater than the entropy carried by the gas.<p>Bekenstein argued that black holes are maximum entropy objects—that they have more entropy than anything else in the same volume. In a sphere of radius R, the entropy in a relativistic gas increases as the energy increases. The only limit is gravitational; when there is too much energy the gas collapses into a black hole. Bekenstein used this to put an upper bound on the entropy in a region of space, and the bound was proportional to the area of the region.

We have resource inputs, which are processed via the churn of economic activity (this is analogous to cellular respiration). This activity sustains the citizens (cells) while also providing resources via taxes to the government (the executive control / brain / etc).

It seems on first blush that a no-cars city with good public transport and good support for walking and cycling would be much more democratic than a city where people rely on cars to get to places. Bikes are much cheaper than cars, food is much cheaper than gas. It&#x27;s much cheaper to take a public transport link to a destination than to take a taxi or rent a car. It seems very counter-intuitive to say &quot;cars are democratic&quot; where then are lot of people who can&#x27;t afford a car. They also seem much less scalable than the alternatives.<p>I&#x27;m lucky enough to live in a city with lots of shops in walking distance of my apartment. There&#x27;s a discount supermarket 15 minutes away where I buy most of my food.<p>If I lived in a city where all the big supermarkets were in strip malls or commercial estates on the outskirts of the city, I&#x27;d have to buy my food at smaller convenience-style stores with much higher prices and a poorer selection of goods.",1386714271

For those of you who don&#x27;t know, the population of metro Atlanta more than doubled between 1990 and 2010.<p>Yes, all types of transportation suck in Atlanta, but roads and cars are an extensible, scaleable solution with most of the costs being marginal as opposed to fixed, meaning additional demand can be handled easily. Like others have noted, you offered no real solutions to that problem. MARTA is kind of a joke of a system for anyone that values their time. A trip on MARTA will take about twice the time it would take to drive in a car. At the average commuter distance, you recoup the cost of buying a $5,000 car in a year if you value your time at minimum wage. If you actually care about fixing the problem, fix the economics of alternatives. Don&#x27;t just go about complaining about the fact that you don&#x27;t like not being able to walk where you want to go, suggest solutions.<p>And please try to consider this problem outside of the perspective of being a student, because that honestly seems to be the only perspective you&#x27;ve given to this.

Better to install <i>next year</i> a more flexible &quot;subway&quot; consisting of buses (Rapid Ride as it should&#x27;ve been).<p>The plan is for Bel-Red Road to become an artsy light-rail corridor, with densely packed restaurants and condos. When that becomes reality my kids will have mostly only 2 choices: a tiny condo for $500K in today&#x27;s dollars, or a junky 1950s house for $1 million+. And the city will be a lot more crowded than it is today. I don&#x27;t think Bellevue will be livable at that point. That&#x27;s not all the city planners&#x27; fault of course.<p><i>My</i> go-to example is Montreal&#x27;s Metro system. I like how they use long buses so there&#x27;s no loud squealing of metal wheels on rails.",1386713237
