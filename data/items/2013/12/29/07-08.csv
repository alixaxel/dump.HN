6978822,comment,6978723,6978723,19,0,nostrademons,,,"This is why everyone should study compilers and machine architecture in college.<p>Anyway, it&#x27;s interesting that he chose to label what he ended up with as &quot;Lisp&quot;.  I would&#x27;ve stopped at assembly, eg. in LLVM IR:<p><pre><code>  %result = icmp gt i8 %price, 100\n  br i1 %result, label %Discount1, label %Discount2\n  Discount1:\n    ret i8 10\n  Discount2:\n    ret i8 5\n</code></pre>\nThe key idea here is that <i>underneath everything you tell the computer to do is boolean logic and transistor circuits</i>.  Yes, even Lisp S-exprs; it&#x27;s not really correct to say &quot;Lisp has no syntax&quot;, it has a very simple syntax that is trivially parseable.  Even LLVM assembly is a translation layer, as is LLVM itself; underneath it on my computer is an i86 processor, and underneath it in my phone is an ARM-architecture Snapdragon.<p>Once you understand that, you realize that all of these languages and frameworks and libraries and databases are just tools, and they exist for <i>your</i> convenience.  They&#x27;re there to let computers handle things that humans are really bad at.  For example, memorizing memory layouts really sucks; let a computer map out your structs onto memory.  Managing heap memory really sucks; let a garbage collector do it.  Managing register allocation really sucks; let a compiler do it.  Managing syntax kind of sucks; let a parser slap something more friendly on top of it, or don&#x27;t and use Lisp.  Managing vtables kind of sucks; let C++ or Java hide it behind a class, or don&#x27;t and continue to use C.<p>Once you&#x27;ve gotten into this mindset, you&#x27;re free from the religious wars that surround technologies, because you realize it&#x27;s all just tools that compile down to machine code at the end.  And you understand when a tool might be useful, and when you could just as easily implement it yourself, and when it once was useful but has since ceased to be.",1388303946

6978811,comment,6978587,6978587,18,0,tqs,,,"From one perspective, Jobs and Raskin ended up going down two opposite paths.<p>Raskin emphasized that &quot;modes&quot; were a major cause of UI problems. Essentially you want a UI that the user can habituate to as strongly as possible, so that all one&#x27;s attention can be focused on the actual task and all of the administrivia you need to do tell the computer your intention are handled subconsciously. Like touch typing at a higher level.<p>The issue with modes is that they break habituation. If performing a given UI gesture does one thing in one mode and another thing in another mode, you can&#x27;t make that gesture a habit. For example: Cmd+Z is a conventional gesture that many applications interpret as undo. If the keyboard shortcut changed between applications (or worse Cmd+Z meant something else in another application/mode), it wouldn&#x27;t be so habitual and you&#x27;d be less productive.<p>Raskin was very serious about no modes. The Cat for example didn&#x27;t even have an on/off mode. It would go to sleep to save power, but if you started typing it would buffer all your key strokes and have them in your document by the time the thing woke up. That is, you didn&#x27;t have to switch from off mode to on mode! And because you were always in a document (that is, there were no separate application modes), you knew that typing some words always did the same thing, so the scheme really worked.<p>On the other hand, Apple has really pushed, especially since iOS, on the &quot;App&quot; model. Applications are, of course, giant modes. And the strategy has been to push a separate App (mode) for every single use of the machine. So rather than learning a few powerful gestures and then combining them to do disparate tasks, users need to learn a separate, surface-level gesture complex (App) for each individual task they want to do on their machine.<p>Which is more efficient or appealing? On what time scale of use?<p>Did Apple end up this way because Apps are a more natural fit for a consumerist model? &quot;Want to do this task with your machine? Don&#x27;t bother figuring out how you can do it yourself. There&#x27;s an App for that!&quot; No Modes vs Buy More Modes?<p>Raskin&#x27;s book, The Humane Interface, talks extensively about his UI design philosophy. In addition to explaining the above problems with modes, he discusses how to actually design a computer system with no modes (I believe an elaboration of what he did with the Cat). He also explains other really important UI principles and their ramifications, for example, &quot;The user&#x27;s data is sacred&quot; (hence undo).<p>PS:<p>Raskin&#x27;s definitions: A <i>gesture</i> is defined as an action that can be done automatically by the body as soon as the brain &quot;gives the command&quot;. So Cmd+Z is a gesture, as is typing the word &quot;brain&quot;. What constitutes a single gesture will be different depending on the user! A <i>mode</i> is defined as any situation <i>not at the user&#x27;s locus of attention</i> that would cause a gesture to perform an action different from another mode. So &quot;pseudomodes&quot; where the user holds down a modifier key or holds the mouse button while performing a drag gesture get around this since they keep the user&#x27;s locus of attention on the fact that they are performing the pseudomode.<p>I think both the above definitions are still a bit problematic but Raskin&#x27;s definitions are better than any other that I&#x27;ve heard. I hope there are more people who study and discuss these deep UI design issues! What do you think about modes?",1388303531

I&#x27;m reckon I&#x27;m better at creating value than I am at link building, so it suits me.<p>That said, Google are not doing a very comprehensive job of busting blackhats. Even some of the cases that an algorithm should be able to easily detect are not being punished in the same way that RapGenius was. This essentially leaves everyone in an awkward situation. You can&#x27;t compete using whitehat methods because your competitors are using blackhat methods and Google is turning a blind eye.

I actually rather like reading and writing (paredit is <i>awesome</i>) Lisp code. But, after quite a bit of Racket, I&#x27;ve found that I still heavily prefer having infix operators and a bit more syntax. At the same time, I also often want <i>less</i> noise--ie no parentheses.

That is, this mindset &quot;let&#x27;s all adopt and learn to use something obtuse and wildly overly-complicated, so that it at least becomes a standard that we can use (and further propagate) elsewhere.&quot; I noticed, for instance, that you didn&#x27;t refute the ugliness of the OP. Your reply instead seems to be saying, &quot;at least we can get the team to use it&quot;.<p>Now, this is really reminding me of EJB. Seriously, it&#x27;s how we end up with these insane &quot;standards&quot;, the embrace of which is probably at least partly responsible for Java&#x27;s reputation as an inefficient language in which to develop.<p>And, there are certainly ways to approach code generation in a team environment, especially if the team was willing to put a fraction of the effort into such an approach, as they would put into learning and maintaining something like the OP. At the end of the day, you just need to get data in and out of the DB. Whether it is ten years old or homegrown shouldn&#x27;t matter so much if it is clean, easily maintained, and efficient. Teams adopt project-specific patterns all the time for other parts of development. Why not for the DB access?<p>But, I just offered up my solution as a way to say that, in all of these years, I have yet to see a truly attractive alternative to something homegrown and &quot;old&quot;. Many seem to agree as here we are with yet another proposal. But, things seem to be getting worse, as the OP is an example that borders on parody of previous offerings. Dynamic proxies and CGLib? Really?<p>When I read the title, I thought maybe someone had nailed it. But, we start with ugly, somewhat declarative code that surfaces SQL syntax, pass around some function names, throw in some mapping, get some dynamic proxies in the mix and, oh yeah, you&#x27;re also gonna need CGLib, etc. I literally thought it was a joke. Then, I come here and the first comment is &quot;This looks really nice&quot;.<p>So, aside from what I have decided to do to solve the problem, I would just ask why the OP approach should be considered a viable alternative and why we favor coalescing around such complicated anti-patterns instead of guiding our &quot;teams&quot; toward saner choices that work.",1388301583

Are they really needed? They are difficult to test and predict, specially the public attributes.<p># The &quot;echo&quot;s on routes. Since every route is a method (encapsulated by one), this behavior could be easily avoided (easier to test and control). You are already using callables, you can easily test (and run) matching routes to execute any callable until a stream is given (on Respect/Rest we learned what a powerful feature it is).<p># Lack of tests. Although low LOC, there is much happening, specially on the &quot;dispatch&quot; method (it would be awesome to know through tests what the If&#x27;s/Else&#x27;s actually do and prevent).<p># Why (as mentioned before) the error header do not provide a proper HTTP header!? It would also be nice to provide two different error routes: one for client errors (404: not found, forbidden) and another to server errors (HTTP/1.1 500 Server Error).<p>A suggestion (we&#x27;ve been talking a lot on Respect/Rest) is to implement the URI Template (RFC 6570) for matching routes and hydration of parameters (something macaw lacks but i like using the PHP way of $_GET, $_POST and filter_input()).\nWith a component dealing nicely with URI Templates many projects would benefit from it.",1388300672
