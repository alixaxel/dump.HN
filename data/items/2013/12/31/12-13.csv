6990221,comment,6989624,6989702,13,0,Alex3917,,,"Total debt per student has substantially increased, and the number of students taking out debt has substantially increased. But actual monthly student loan payments for students with debt are only nominally higher, and perhaps largely due to jobs paying less:<p>&quot;In 2009 65.6% of first-time bachelor&#x27;s degree recipients took out student loans, compared with 49.3% in 1994. Of those who borrowed, the cumulative amount borrowed was $24,700 in 2009, as compared with $14,700 (2009 dollars) in 1994. [...]<p>Among first-time bachelor&#x27;s degree recipients with loans and who were employed and repaying their loans 1 year after bachelor&#x27;s degree receipt, the average monthly loan repayments were 13.1% of monthly salary in 2009, as compared with 11.1% in 1994. The median monthly loan repayments were 8.0% in 2009, as compared with 6.8% in 1994.<p>In 2009 51.7% had monthly loan repayments that were 1-8% of their monthly salary, 17.1% had monthly loan repayments that were 9-12% of their monthly salary, 11.7% had monthly loan repayments that were 13-17% of their monthly salary, and 19.4% had monthly loan repayments that were more than 17% of their monthly salary.&quot; Source: Tables 1, 6, 7: <a href""http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013156.pd"" rel""nofollo"">http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013156.pdf</a><p>So basically the macroeconomic view wildly exaggerates the situation; while it is a problem that students with bachelors degrees are getting shitty jobs, the idea that it&#x27;s impossible for students to get an education without outrageous monthly loan payments is just wrong. The people getting fucked over by college debt are mainly the ones who enroll in scam for-profit colleges, rack up hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt, and then don&#x27;t graduate. Getting an actual bachelors degree is only nominally to moderately more expensive than it was 40 years ago. The fact that college graduates aren&#x27;t well-educated enough to get good jobs is an enormous problem, but the idea that college is suddenly unaffordable because of cost increases is complete BS. Consider also:<p>&quot;The net TFRB (tuition/room/fees/board sticker price minus total grant aid and tax benefits) at public 4-year colleges for in-state residents increased from $7,400 in 1990-91 (2012 dollars) to $12,110 in 2012-13.

It has been announted that GFWL is going to shutdown July 1st. Many developers/publishers have indicated that they are going to remove/replace it, but Rockstar not only hasn&#x27;t mentioned anything in that sense, it has recently updated the fine print on the steam store for GTA IV adding new clauses:<p><pre><code>    Access to special features may require internet connection, may not be available to all users, and may, upon 30 days’ notice, be terminated, modified, or offered under different terms.\n    Unauthorized copying, reverse engineering, transmission, public performance, rental, pay for play, or circumvention of copy protection is strictly prohibited\n    Partner Requirements: Please check the terms of service of this site before purchasing this software. rockstargames.com/eula\n</code></pre>\nSo while Rockstar is washing their hands if their offline, single player, triple-A game stops working in six months, and also prohibiting circumvention of this &#x27;protection&#x27;, GTA IV is happily being sold by Steam, even today being promoted in their store front page as a daily deal of their winter sale.",1388494154

You can not like that the NSA is a spy organization and we can debate whether we should conduct spy operations as a society, but I&#x27;m not sure what exposing their methods in this level of detail does for advancing that debate. Did people expect them to be a spy organization that was incompetent? A group that makes crappy and obvious listening devices stamped with &quot;Designed by the NSA in Maryland&quot;? On the other hand, the cases of potential abuses and dragnet surveillance capturing everything indiscriminately are extremely worrying.

There is no law in France <i>or</i> most other EC territories as illustrated in your link.<p>Phones sold, <i>in France</i> on pay-as-you-go (forfait bloqué) and monthly deals (forfait) come with a <i>locked</i> phone.

Is that just because I never tried selling anything?<p>Does anybody have examples of successful startups that proceeded in the way Sergio describes and became successful -- starting out with a business person/team, selling the goods first, then manage to find developer(s) to build it?
