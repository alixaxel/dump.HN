But I guess the question is relative value.<p>In baseball or basketball, a younger age does make a difference (since performance is proportional to athleticism). Veterans are still highly regarded for leadership, and sometimes pure skill (setup man, utility infielder, 3-point shooter); Though they&#x27;re called on less and usually earn less then their heyday. Would we ever see something similar in the code business?! I don&#x27;t know. In the case of coding, experience goes up, but perhaps desire to not work like crazy goes down (family, done it before, etc).<p>Maybe we should pay even higher salaries to bright youngins with huge signing bonuses? And let them know that their expected prime is 21-34. And they should manage their money wisely and open a carwash or burgerking or two.... :P",1378043997

The system, when deployed, will benefit hundreds of thousands of people around the world. And it was built by a for-profit corporation.<p>Building that system took about four years. That&#x27;s four years of 150+ individuals working directly on its design and realization. That means writing code, doing industrial design, laying out PCBs with 20+ layers and thousands of components, working out soldering processes via electron microscopy, ensuring regulatory requirements such as IEC 60601 3rd Edition are met, managing complex schedules, debugging extremely difficult problems, etc.<p>Now, go even one level deeper and think about the tens or hundreds of thousands of people involved in developing the components and systems used to build this new ultrasound system. How about the software used to design ASICs? Systems on a chip, like the TI DaVinci series? And what of the businessman that starts a reliability lab so customers can get dye and pry services to analyze BGA soldering problems?<p>Is this the kind of innovation that you choose to label so derisively?",1378043806

6310359,comment,6309882,6309882,9,0,c3o,,,"We need a BIG because it is becoming a required human right in an information society. More and more, power and opportunity are determined by access to information, and we&#x27;re making strides in democratizing that and thereby decentralizing power. But to actually realize the benefits from increased access to information requires freedom from existential fear (and education and a mostly discrimination-free society). If we do not fix these problems, we&#x27;re not improving the world with all our wonderful tech tools but establishing a digital elite.<p>We need a BIG because it encourages risk taking. Society is built largely on the backs of low-wage laborers, but actually benefits most from free, educated, motivated people chasing not just a living wage but a fulfilling occupation. The ingenuity of human minds is our greatest, most renewable, still hugely untapped resource. It should be society&#x27;s goal to enable and tap that potential. YCombinator sort of pays smart people BIs for a summer not as a reward for work but to ENABLE them to work, to great benefit (though not entirely unconditionally, obviously). When and why have we given up hope of expanding such concepts to all of society?<p>We need a BIG because markets are made of people, which means there can be no free market without free people. Many people today are not free but under economic duress. Only once people&#x27;s livelihoods are secured, the labor market will produce win-win situations and exploitation will be eliminated (giving everyone a benefit most of us techies already enjoy). Finally, jobs will be paid what they&#x27;re actually worth to us rather than what employers can get away with. Unpopular tasks will have to be fairly (=highly) paid or automated. A BIG actually perfects capitalism, rather than undermining it.<p>We need a BIG because it&#x27;s not possible to &quot;live off the land&quot; by your own labor anymore in our society. An income is required for survival.<p>We need a BIG because progress is eliminating (the need for) many low-wage, manual labor jobs. &quot;Full employment&quot; is becoming less and less necessary or desirable.<p>We need a BIG because many tasks society benefits from aren&#x27;t paid: Caring for the elderly, raising kids,... but even writing open source software or contributing to Wikipedia. People doing such work today are either privileged, dependent on others or in precarious living conditions. All of these strike me as things we should work to avoid.<p>We need a BIG because it is fair and simple – paid not just to the jobless, but everyone. It is empowerment rather than a bureaucratically administered handout with all kinds of social stigma attached.",1378043775

By doing what she does she relieves the system from taking care of her grandmother, and thereby making whatever small amount of taxpayer money usable for something else meanwhile taking that economic burden on herself.<p>(Edit: It can of course be seen that whatever wellfare money she gets is the equivalent of her service to grandmother/society, but in that case it&#x27;s still at worst a zero sum scenario.)",1378043766

His parents have the means to help him buy an apartment, but doing so would disqualify him from receiving any disability pension (including free health care).<p>A colleague of mine once employed a young woman as a secretary/admin assistant. One day her family advised him that they had arranged a marriage for her and as she was no longer living with them she and her new husband would both qualify for unemployment benefits. If my colleague refused to pay her the equivalent of two unemployment benefits (after tax) she would resign. The next week she did.<p>I used to know a guy who was what I would term chronically unemployable.

Social security in many countries mean that it&#x27;s rational to either work many hours per week or work zero hours per week. Basic income means that every hour worked or dollar earned increases your standard of living, thus creating a higher incentive to work.<p>>You&#x27;d have two classes of citizens: the workers and those who are effectively parasites off of the workers. I don&#x27;t like people being poor but society is just not wealthy for poverty to disappear.<p>There are countries like Finland with a social security guarantee. You can pretty much refuse to work and get $1000/month as a social security (though there are details and sanctions which make this more complex in reality). Anyway, the point is this: in Finland you can already be a &quot;parasite&quot; and some people do that.<p>Finland doesn&#x27;t have a basic income guarantee. We also have a system where living on basic social security (toimeentulotuki) working 5 hours per week doesn&#x27;t really make sense. The effective tax rate for working only a little is 90-100%. If you make 100 euros per week, the social security is decreased by 100 euros. With basic income the effective tax rate would be 20-30%, so working would make sense.<p>In Finland you pretty much have either full-time/part-time workers (20+ hours) or people who are completely unemployed.<p>Why should a citizen living on basic income would want to work? To get paid more.<p>An unemployed person living on $1000/month basic income can increase his or her standard of living substantially by getting paid $200/month more. If someone is working full time and getting paid $3000/month, a $200 increase per month has a lesser increase in standard of living.<p>The current social security system has an incentive to be completely unemployed. Basic income means that it makes sense to work 1 hours, 2 hours, 5 hours, 10hours, 20 hours or 40 hours per week. All different kinds of working situations are naturally covered under basic income guarantee.",1378041848

After all, slumlords usually live in nice places themselves.<p>If it were universal, it would also replace the &quot;game student loan recipients&quot; (U of Phoenix...) with &quot;game BI&quot;, but since BI is much more flexible, it&#x27;s harder to game.  It&#x27;s just &quot;there&#x27;s a much greater demand for products in the $10-30k/yr income bracket&quot;, which should reduce prices (through competition, economy of scale, etc.) for goods with declining marginal cost to produce, like say cheap phones.

There is nothing you could do about that, if you want to visit that country, except not bring along the property.<p>Another treatment of some kinds of property is charging a tariff, even if the property will remain in the traveler&#x27;s possession after leaving the country. I have seen this done. Some items carried by Americans were dutiable in Taiwan even if they were not items that would be sold in Taiwan. (This was in the 1980s.) The customs duty for some items, by the tariff laws Taiwan then had, were equal to the full retail price of the items (mostly consumer electronics, as in the case I observed).<p>Or the property could be held in bonded storage at the airport until you finish your journey. That happens for some items in some countries too.<p>To sum up, just because you can lock your phone doesn&#x27;t mean you will be able to travel around the world with your phone. Try that in North Korea. Try that in some other places, and see what happens. Countries can control the entry of tangible property into their territory if they so choose.",1378040878
