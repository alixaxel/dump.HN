6339223,comment,6338616,6339100,3,0,jmspring,,,"Not a strawman at all...teachers unions are all about seniority over effectiveness and will fight tooth and nail accordingly.  Many other unions are similar.  I agree to the policy of public bargaining, but individual members should be subjected to measurements of their effectiveness.  Tenure based on the sake of time (only) should not have equal weight to merit within the union structure.  I say this as a product of public education and having many wonderful teachers, but saw younger ones forced out where older were tenured in and safe but not effective.  I can&#x27;t speak to other unions which I did not experience.<p>The unions helped build the middle class in this country.  The apprentice/journeyman/master levels within the trades is a great measure of skill and advancement, but regardless of trade (metal working, teaching, programming, etc) your tenure should be one component of your measure, but not the sole measure.  Do you continue to learn?  Do you teach?  Are you advancing the best interests of the group?  There is more than &quot;oh, I&#x27;ve been here longer than you&quot;.<p>This is what I mean when I talk greed and seniority.<p>Yes, unions have faced an offensive, but their insular nature has also harmed them just as much as the outside offensives.",1378454167

This is not why you should go to Harvard.

Coursera, Udacity, Khan, edX...lots of people are making a very good go at it. Delivering the personal and social development that comes with a college education - that&#x27;s the hard part. That&#x27;s I have to disagree with Ferreira when he says:<p>> <i>Even Harvard could admit five totally different freshman classes every year from the United States alone without compromising its standards</i><p>Technically, this is probably true. The majority of people applying to Harvard are more than qualified on paper (I&#x27;ve interviewed enough of them!). But a college education is so, so much more than just taking classes and getting good grades. It is about developing as a person, finding yourself. Doing that online: that&#x27;s a very, very hard problem.<p>The funny thing is that Harvard <i>already</i> is making significant progress in the six areas Ferreira has identified (...edX, for example, a self governing body that uses the Harvard brand to further internet learning).

No chance.)<p>The other camp doesn&#x27;t care about it, more or less. Sure, they would like it if there was no dial-back for the games, but it doesn&#x27;t hinder them from still buying and playing at platforms/games that require this as long as their playing experience isn&#x27;t dimished by it. Steam is more or less the platform of choice for the second camp and seems to be growing all the time, so most users probably would acccept an dial-back connection once, every 30 days or even at every start.

6339113,comment,6338601,6339069,1,0,tristanj,,,"UV radiation found in sunlight can produce Pyrimidine dimers, which can lead to genetic mutations. Essentially, the UV radiation causes two DNA bases (Thymine or Cytosine) to fuse together and make that portion of DNA unreadable. Fortunately, our cells have mechanisms to repair such DNA damage, but if damage is acquired faster than the cell is able to repair itself, then permanent mutation is likely. If a cell acquires too many mutations, the mechanisms that prevent it from continuously replicating may fail, and the cell will replicate uncontrollably and spread throughout the body. This situation is known as cancer, and can occur in many different ways, making it fairly difficult to treat.<p>There&#x27;s a nice summary of the process listed here:\n<a href=""http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/6/3/298.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theoncologist.alphamedpress.org/content/6/3/298.full</a>",1378451672

I&#x27;m currently learning 3d modeling, in the hope to buy a 3d printer, and look with interest toward project like arduino and raspberry PI.<p>I&#x27;ve never read anything about cryptography.<p>My first thought about cryptography is : &quot;well, that&#x27;s something especially difficult and that carries a lot of responsibilities&quot;. So what ? So is playing with memory in C (both difficult and may easily create vulnerabilities). That&#x27;s a good reason not to release anything while unprepared, but not a good reason to know nothing in this field.<p>I suspect I&#x27;m far from being the only one is that case : we do not care that much about cryptography, and that&#x27;s a problem. That&#x27;s a problem because if we swarmed the world with cryptography discussions and toy projects - just like we do with other fields - we could expect new ideas to appear a lot more quickly, and have a lot of alternative where we&#x27;re all just use ssl nowadays in most of our applications.<p>There are reference resources about almost anything on the web.
