They are generally full of shit about this issue just like they are full of shit when it comes to nearly every other. Please stop electing career politicians for public office, they only want to hurt you.<p>The last time it actually happened was in the 90s, and it only lasted a week or so.<p>It&#x27;s possible that the Soldiers won&#x27;t get paid, but it will be the result of a bunch of wealthy old white men throwing a tantrum (both democrats and republicans alike) because they didn&#x27;t get their way.<p>Once again, please stop re-electing congressman and governors.

6460974,comment,6456193,6460680,1,0,wpietri,,,"If I understand your question rightly, yes. Looking at the Github history, we did actually have 6 branches over the life of the project. All were extended technical experiments of one sort or another like trying out a new templating approach. 2/6 were merged. But all normal coding was pushed to master with no branching (beyond a local checkout and local commits, which are a sort of branching, but none of those lasted longer than a day). There, any checkin triggered tests, and any build that passed the test was pushed live.<p>If you want others to see the benefit, I&#x27;d encourage you to pick a specific area of the code, test the hell out of it, and make sure that a) tests are easy and quick to run on dev boxes, and b) every checkin is automatically tested. I&#x27;d start small, and one good place is a chunk of important business logic. It&#x27;s even better if you use the tests to support refactoring and general cleanup of an area people know is messy.<p>If you do this right, then people will have two experiences coding on the project. In the tested code, it&#x27;s pleasant and safe. In the messy code, it feels dangerous and scary. Over time they may get it.<p>Note that this is really hard to get off the ground in an established company and in an existing code base. So if they don&#x27;t catch on, don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s you. (I generally cheat by being the first person on greenfield projects, so the first line of code written is a line of test code.) Also, if you get stuck while trying to clean up legacy code to make it testable, Michael Feathers&#x27; book &quot;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&quot; is very helpful.<p>Good luck, and feel free to drop me an email if you end up with more questions.",1380343519

Do you really believe that people are saying &quot;Man, this 7-inch is so much better than a 7.9-inch&quot; They&#x27;re probably not. If consumers are buying other tablets it&#x27;s likely due to price.<p>In addition, the report itself said that The 7.9-inch iPad mini represented about 60% of total iPad shipments and 49% of iPad-related device revenues in the quarter. That should tell you that the mini IS more popular than the larger iPad.<p>I really have to call you out on the &quot;specs were disappointing and offered questionable value&quot; point you made. I, myself own an iPad mini. In fact, I sold my larger iPad and solely use the mini now. I can&#x27;t tell you how many friends pick up my mini and say &quot;oh my God, I want this.&quot; Not a single one of them have said &quot;How much RAM does this have?&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s the resolution of the screen?&quot; Those are both things that I don&#x27;t believe the general consumer care about. They want it to &quot;just work&quot; and the iPad mini does that very well.<p>Finally, the report doesn&#x27;t go into detail as to what they define as an Android tablet. Is it a cheap $79 dollar Walmart tablet (<a href=""http://www.walmart.com/ip/Nextbook-7-Tablet-with-8GB-Memory-with-Google-Mobile-Services/22127002"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.walmart.com/ip/Nextbook-7-Tablet-with-8GB-Memory-...</a>)? Is it Kindle Fire&#x27;s, Nooks, and Nexus 7&#x27;s? It&#x27;s likely that they&#x27;re considering all of them and to that I would say that not all tablets are created equal. In fact, just like the smartphone market, there&#x27;s enough evidence out there that suggests that nearly 50% of &quot;Android smartphones&quot; are actually shitty phones running Android, nearly incapable of accessing apps and can barely access the internet.<p>The point of all this is to say that that &quot;report&quot; is pretty deceiving and doesn&#x27;t paint the whole picture.

The reason Android sells more tablets, globally, is the same reason Android sells many more phones:   Apple doesn&#x27;t compete in the bottom of the market.<p>Apple makes tablets that sell for $329 to $929. If you limited yourself to that market you&#x27;d find that Apple sells the overwhelming majority of such tablets.<p>If OTOH you limited your comparison to &quot;tablets under $300&quot; (an actual &quot;hot link&quot; at Amazon) you&#x27;ll find that zero of these tablets are from Apple and hence Apple&#x27;s market share for this part of the tablet market is a (perhaps shocking) 0%.  You&#x27;d find a few windows and linux tablets but mostly 95%+ Android tablets (including forks).<p>This does not mean Apple has been outfoxed by a more agile opponent.  Apple presumably could ship a lower quality tablet at every price point from $50 to $250 with their eyes closed.",1380340828
