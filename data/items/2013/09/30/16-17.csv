Even with radiation shielding, it&#x27;s not that expensive to ship a whole lot of them from Earth. These can be used to &quot;refresh&quot; genetic information from Earth and ensure enough genetic diversity. If medical technology has progressed far enough, it may even be possible to send sequencing data and avoid shipping material altogether.<p>2) Keep everyone born on Mars underground and shielded from radiation, at least until they can store their genetic material in radiation immune facilities for breeding later.<p>3) Everyone immigrating from Earth would be wise to store and ship their own genetic information. This can be sent on the same flights with the &quot;backup diversity&quot; information in (1), which would greatly minimize the cost. The marginal cost for another sample of eggs/sperm is going to be pretty low.<p>Also keep in mind that not every launch has to contain such information.",1380560384

It isn&#x27;t meant to be hand-edited or even read, since we minify heavily to keep file sizes extremely small.<p>While everything has its tradeoffs, we went with this approach because:<p>- Our app has a lot of animation and interactivity capabilities not meaningfully expressed through anything but JavaScript.  For example, we don&#x27;t use CSS3 Animations nor transitions because they aren&#x27;t powerful enough (pausing, synchronization, etc.).<p>- We have better control over how we express the DOM to the browser.  There&#x27;s plenty of browser bugs or incompatibilities which sometimes require us to on-the-fly change the DOM structure or which properties we are using.<p>- The user could easily bork the output so it could not be read back in<p>- No tool will ever produce output that will appease everyone :)<p>We provide lots of hooks in and outside of the runtime for your own JavaScript and HTML so you can still customize quite a bit.<p>So it isn&#x27;t that our output isn&#x27;t very clean (in fact I&#x27;m quite proud of the runtime and how we&#x27;ve been able to add features without increasing bloat); it is that edits are meant to happen from the app itself.",1380560317

6470693,comment,6469835,6470419,3,0,Anchor,,,"Here&#x27;s Uncle Bob talking on his version of the idea extensively: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkDN78P884"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpkDN78P884</a> The main idea is to separate the system into entities, interactors and boundaries, which correspond roughly to model, controllers and interfaces+DTOs (Data Transfer Objects), but with the difference that model classes are not exposed through the interfaces. Rather, the DTOs are used to communicate the changes in the data.<p>We have been using this approach for a year now, with REST on top, and it so far has worked beautifully. The entities map naturally to REST resources and DTOs makes nice request and response classes.<p>Armed with CQRS (now I sound enterprise-y), the data storage is easy to work with using the same DTOs (the data storage and its interface do not know anything about the entities either). On the DB implementation level, we work on the DTOs, which are trivial to store to the database (even without ORM, although it does remove much of the boilerplate). Only one class - the entity repository - is needed to convert the DTOs to entities, and this only happens on create, update, and delete. Reads (due to CQRS) go directly to DB without instantiating any entities - neat. We also use &#x27;unit of work&#x27; -pattern to abstract the notion of transaction on create, update, and delete operations, which simplifies the interactor code, hiding the nature of the data storage (making it a swappable in this respect too).<p>But to stay on topic, our tests are fast too as the interactors can be tested by injecting an in-memory database as a data storage to test the business logic, and the interactors have no dependencies on any frameworks, web or otherwise. Testing the interfaces makes BDD feel natural and also supports clear separation of the REST layer (the communication channel) and the interactors (business logic).",1380560288

6470604,comment,6469835,6470478,4,0,lmm,,,"> The _unit_ test for the service object might be anemic, but it&#x27;s far from useless IMO. The unit test helps you design the object under test and it is written first if you are practicing TDD.<p>But it doesn&#x27;t help when your test is solving the same problem. If your test says &quot;this object calls collaborator1 and collaborator2, then passes both results to collaborator3&quot; then that&#x27;s exactly the same design problem you&#x27;d have if you were to just write the object straight-up.<p>This is why people talk about BDD rather than simply TDD. It&#x27;s not about having tests, it&#x27;s about identifying the user-facing behaviour that you want, testing that, and then writing your objects to conform to it. This really does help your design, because it lets you start with the appropriate interface on the user side and work down from there, and the resulting object boundaries can be better than the ones you&#x27;d have thought of if you started with design. But if you restrict your test to a single class and mock its collaborators then that implies you&#x27;ve already decided what your class boundaries are; in effect you&#x27;ve already done the most important part of the design.<p>>The argument for having fewer integration tests goes like this: if it&#x27;s hard to write isolated unit tests for some classes you end up testing many more execution paths in integrations tests.<p>True enough - if there are things you can&#x27;t test in a unit test then you need to test them in an integration test. So if you have a complex piece of logic that you want to run several tests of, it&#x27;s best if you can test that piece of logic in isolation - this is exactly what unit tests are good at.<p>But you still need to test all your integration pathways. All too often a class doesn&#x27;t contain any logic as such, particularly when you design the way the article suggests - it&#x27;s just an integration between its collaborators. For such a class there&#x27;s no point in unit testing, because the only thing the class actually does is integration.",1380559359

This is reduced when in some cases for example when urandom is used. When the entropy remaining runs out urandom will have to wait for more. You can specifically tell the system &quot;I&#x27;ve added lots of entropy&quot; and then urandom will not stall but may make some not-very-random random numbers.

6470319,comment,6468521,6469103,5,0,_mulder_,,,"This is exactly right, for me at least.<p>Sometimes its easy to know what is required, and probably guess at how long it will take (15mins or 1 day), usually because you&#x27;ve seen other people do it this quick. But if you don&#x27;t know how to do it, and even worse, don&#x27;t know where to start to learn it (which book to read, which course to take, who to ask) you can end up sitting about doing nothing but getting frustrated.<p>A great example is Linux. You know a task is easy (like creating an automated backup), but you can&#x27;t just go and do it. You need to read up on it, you need to learn CRON and how it works, you&#x27;ve then got to read up on the subtle differences of your linux distro vs the one in the tutorial. You then need to read up on chmod or sudo to change the permissions, etc., etc.<p>Point is, it&#x27;s an easy task once you know how, but when you don&#x27;t know how, all you see is a huge mountain of learning you have to do to achieve it. And to make matters worse, sometimes the juice isn&#x27;t worth the squeeze. Why spend all day reading up on Linux just to copy some files?<p>End result... I&#x27;ll do it tomorrow",1380557111
