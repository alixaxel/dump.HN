The idea that I might just need a few years more practise is what keeps me working hard. If something innate is required to excel I simply don&#x27;t have it, though. Therefore it would be really painful if the 10k hour rule doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>The logical conclusion for me therefore always has been to believe that more work will result in way better results.

If you do make the outer envelope essentially airtight, that gives you very low energy consumption and is part of the passive house concept, but then you need active ventilation, which obviously implies a hole in the envelope, and thus will keep the pressure inside equalized with the pressure outside (modulo a small differential caused by the ventilation itself).",1406788045

My dad could practice his instruments (guitar, bass, drums) and not annoy the neighbors. We also had a garage full of tools. And we had a large dog.<p>Since I left I&#x27;ve only ever lived in apartments.

People can have different sensitivities to this.<p>- Non e-ink displays tend to have higher contrast and/or brightness. This would normally be considered an advantage, but again perhaps not for prolonged use.<p>I don&#x27;t need scientific papers to tell me I find e-ink more comfortable or not, it becomes very quickly apparent when I try to read a book on a tablet.

The best cities for humans tend to have great subway systems, but in theory we could do a lot more.  Basically all parking and most arterial roads could be underground, leaving above-ground an almost-entirely pedestrian paradise.  Sure, driving in an endless tunnel doesn&#x27;t sound terribly pleasant, but the idea is to get people from A to B efficiently, then out of the car.  Unfortunately building this kind of infrastructure under existing cities would be prohibitively expensive.<p>Under a new town you might be able to do it much more cheaply (which isn&#x27;t to say cheaply in an absolute sense), but of course the economic incentive isn&#x27;t there at that point.<p>That said, with services like Uber, and much more so, driverless vehicles, hopefully the desire to bring a car along wherever we go will begin to ebb in the near future, making the narrow street vision described here much less of a compromise.  I imagine those times when you need a car to get somewhere, spending some of the time weaving around through carts and pedestrians would be much less frustrating if you can kick back and read a book while it&#x27;s happening.  Even more though, there would be less concern of servicing parking for these sorts of regions, so you could still have a few arterial roads to get in and out, far less wasted parking space, and no need to build underground mazes to accomplish it.",1406786705
