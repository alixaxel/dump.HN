We need there to be no way of ever quite knowing if any given order will beat another order to the exchange (within a given time period, of course). They won&#x27;t know if they can beat joe ordinary, and they definitely won&#x27;t know if they can beat the other HFT&#x27;s. That might be enough to put a lid on it.<p>Edit: For those playing along, here&#x27;s the metaphor. Joe goes to market to buy sheep. Bill knows Joe is going so he sends a fast runner ahead of him to buy the cheapest sheep in town first so he can mark them up and sell them to Joe when he arrives. We try making everyone wait at the town gate for a random amount of time to give Joe a chance to arrive and get through. So Bill (being very rich) just sends 10 guys so one is very likely to be let in before Joe anyway. Next we introduce the stochastic filter. We make everyone line up and then shuffle the order every once in a while, but Bill still has more guys so he might still get one in first more often than not. Finally, we add the token bucket. For every one guy that we know employed by Bill admitted, we make the next one wait twice as long to get in, so if Joe and 10 Bills show up, Joe and the first Bill are essentially on even footing again because the 2nd through 10th Bill would have to wait too long to matter.",1405500954

Many people have a Gmail account and a YouTube account, but do you see many people using their Docs offering instead of Microsoft Office?<p>Without trying to sound too harsh, the problem with Google is that they have a faddish focus, and don&#x27;t appear to maintain some product offerings once they are past the &quot;look! It&#x27;s NEW!&quot; phase. If you made the recommendation to switch to Google&#x27;s systems, would your manager be asking &quot;How long is it going to be there for?&quot;. It&#x27;s a pity. Do you see &quot;enterprise&quot; switching to systems like that? Do you see loads of Chromebooks and Chromeboxes (do they even still make them?) on desks instead of PCs? Honestly?<p>This is different to Microsoft&#x27;s strategy where you can still run software from 20 years ago, and some businesses like only investing in software once, instead of an ongoing licensing fee. I do not see Microsoft disappearing quickly, despite how popular web apps are in startup circles; Windows still rules the enterprise desktop.<p>I myself write software on a Mac but everybody else here has never used a Mac and are flummoxed if presented with its desktop, and typically see Apple products are overpriced.<p>High end customers would involve large corporations where there would be a need for many PCs traditionally. Although iPads have become popular with BYOD, do most people just accept that it&#x27;s a great consumer (consuming) device and not marvellous for creation of content? If large corporations were to switch their desktops to Apple machines, do you think the profit margin would increase or decrease?<p>It just isn&#x27;t going to happen.",1405500821
