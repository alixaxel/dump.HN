A couple of points:<p>* Amazon isn&#x27;t known for wasting time or money. They wouldn&#x27;t have delayed the release of their first-ever phone for an expensive gimmick. Sticking a cheap gimmick on within time requirements is doable.<p>* 3D rendering is, well, a solved problem. Accelerometers have been incorporated into phone UIs for more than five years. Even facial detection is in most modern digital cameras. Tying these things together doesn&#x27;t require sending a whole lot of information back and forth -- you just update a couple of vectors representing estimates of phone location and head location.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be too surprised, given Amazon&#x27;s track record, to find that Dynamic Perspective started as kind of a &quot;why not?&quot;.  If people can make cool things out of it, they&#x27;ll keep it: it might be partially a trick to get developers to target the device, and to make interesting things out of it.

Gary Kildall received far less recognition than he was due during his lifetime, and a story -- by all appearances, unfounded -- regarding his sloppy handling of the IBM deal was pushed, mainly for PR reasons, by a lot of tech &quot;journalists&quot; along with the likes of Bill Gates himself. Perhaps even more ironically -- considering IEEE&#x27;s distinction now -- is that his own alma mater treated him rather unceremoniously, famously inviting him to attend their CS program anniversary in 1992, but asking Gates, a dropout from a rival university, to deliver the keynote speech. He apparently lapsed into alcoholism later in his life, which ended with a motorcycle accident.<p>I certainly applaud IEEE&#x27;s initiative, but I cannot shake off that feeling of &quot;too little, too late&quot;.",1406097643

It&#x27;s only input is often `time` and `resolution`.<p>At least in GLSL there&#x27;s a global variable, `gl_Fragcoord` and provides the integer position of the pixel currently being drawn. So for example the pixel at the bottom left is gl_Fragcoord = vec2(0,0). The one directly to the right of that is gl_Fragcoord = vec2(0,1)<p>Given you&#x27;re also passed the resolution can get a value that goes from 0 to 1 over the screen with<p><pre><code>   vec2 zeroToOne = gl_Fragcoord.xy / resolution;\n</code></pre>\nIf you were to dump that value directly do the screen you&#x27;d get a red gradient going black to red from left to right and a green gradient from black to green going from bottom to top.

See Wi-Fi Capture for details.\n  If your app uses HTTP, you can configure your iOS device to use a debugging HTTP proxy (such as Charles HTTP Proxy).\n  In iOS 5 and later you can use the remote virtual interface facility.\n</code></pre>\nThere does not seem to be a mention of that pcapd capability in there...",1406095798
