8060445,comment,8059919,8059919,1,0,ryangee,,,"Yes, it&#x27;s possible. There is a blogging platform called Greymatter which used to be popular that you can draw inspiration from.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter_%28software%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greymatter_%28software%29</a><p>When you&#x27;d add a comment to a blog post on Greymatter, it would write that content to it&#x27;s own flatfile database, then trigger a rendering update which would read the content, transform it with a template, and produce a new .html file, overwriting the old one. Bam! Dynamic site based on (mostly) static pages.<p>I don&#x27;t see why a forum or social platform couldn&#x27;t be built in a similar manner. You won&#x27;t be able to do much in the way of per-user authorization, but as long as all your content is supposed to be viewable to everyone, you should be OK.<p>One problem with Greymatter was that if a thread or site grew large, sometimes generating new files from templates would take so long that your connection to the CGI would time out before they were finished. Another problem was that two updates to the site posted at about the same time could stomp on each other during the rendering phase.<p>&#x27;Cause hey, flatfiles are hard. That&#x27;s why I wouldn&#x27;t forgo using a real database in favor of flatfiles. If you don&#x27;t want to run MySQL or Postgres on an RPI, then use SQLite. There is, after all, a reason that these products exist. Let SQLite or MySQL deal with the flatfiles for your instead of re-inventing yet another wheel.<p>I also wouldn&#x27;t update the .html files the moment someone posted. I&#x27;d have the scripts just commit the post to the database, and then regularly re-render the files from a cron script. This avoids having your rendering stage stomp on each other, provided that the rendering time is less than your rendering interval.",1405868330

8060443,comment,8059539,8060121,1,0,waps,,,"You know, I doubt that&#x27;s the case. Greece and Cyprus have crossed the EU, lied to them, and committed acts that should have meant getting kicked out of the EU. Nothing happened. If anything the EU keeps giving them more money.<p>So now everybody knows : clearly the EU is more interested in expanding their membership and maintaining power than it is interested in financial sense and applying treaties.<p>So while Ireland certainly seems to think the EU has a gun to their heads, this is only true if Ireland&#x27;s parliament cooperates. Ireland&#x27;s parliament could simply order it&#x27;s banks to print Euros, lie to the ECB (they&#x27;re already doing that, after all. That&#x27;s what the Euro crisis was about). Ireland&#x27;s parliament could simply vote to do that, and while they&#x27;re at it, vote a law that this does not violate the European treaty. Then it&#x27;d be up to Brussels to kick them out, and they&#x27;ve already shown that they won&#x27;t do that, no matter what. They&#x27;re sovereign, there&#x27;s a million ways they could do this.<p>So in short : you&#x27;re right, in theory. In practice, the law is simply what parliament votes to be law, and they could shortcut your reasoning at any point. Given what&#x27;s already happened in the PIGS, I think they will at some point in the not-too-distant future show us that theory and practice are very different indeed.",1405868251

8060419,comment,8059539,8060142,1,0,waps,,,"That&#x27;s what always amazed me. Are the banks rich ? When inspecting their balance sheets, assuming (probably wrongly) that they&#x27;re not hiding anything, I&#x27;m richer than they are percentually.<p>Now what I mean by that is that if you take the ratio of assets + money I own and divide it by the money I owe, and even ignore things like the NPV of my business (unless I close it tonight, it&#x27;s not zero, right ?), then that ratio is a lot bigger for me than it is for stuff like JP Morgan and so on (for one, it&#x27;s significantly bigger than 1, somewhere between 1.3 and 1.5, hell if I&#x27;m optimistic on my house, maybe even 2, but I&#x27;m dreaming. JPM is nowhere near 1). That&#x27;s how banks&#x27; capital works : lots of big loans. The majority of their capital does not even actually come from their shareholders, but from fractional reserve banking. Most banks have values that are below 1, which you would think makes them bankrupt, but I guess I&#x27;m seeing that wrong.<p>Creating a new bank means you effectively get to multiply money, over time, by a factor of 20 to 50, depending, assuming you can make enough loans and deposits. Given that that&#x27;s how that works, how can that possibly not be a crime ? The more I read about that, the more I&#x27;m inclined to go into finance and find a few more of those kinds of transactions I can do.<p>So can you explain a stupid question to me ? Why can&#x27;t I borrow the amounts these big banks do in my own company, skim off 2% for myself (they, on average, do about 4%, so 2% seems like a sweet deal), and be richer than Bill Gates (by a very nice factor) ?

Running multiple networks is the same thing - generate one key per SSID and duplicate them across all APs.<p>According to the other comments, apparently something like this is already a feature in WPA2, so evidently it doesn&#x27;t break down too much.",1405866009
