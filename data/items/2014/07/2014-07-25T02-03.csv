It wasn&#x27;t that long ago that such a capability was far beyond the capabilities of an average programmer. Libraries like numpy/scikit, pyml, and their counterparts in other languages have made this far more prevalent.<p>I recently helped my girlfriend (bioinformatics PhD! /brag) implement an SVM in Python for feature selection of 20k genes, to determine which could be used to classify a tumorous cell. I was amazed that with less than 20 lines of Python, she had a fast, functional SVM that could classify with ~80% accuracy. That&#x27;s damn impressive.<p>In general the scientific community is not filled with the highest quality programmers, so it&#x27;s great that we are seeing development in easily accessible ML toolkits, because they enable sub-par scientific programmers to employ modern ML algorithms without needing to know the details of how to implement them.<p>Tl;dr Cool project, glad to see machine learning libraries taking off, will lead to curing cancer :)",1406256632

So here&#x27;s the question: isn&#x27;t this <i>exactly</i> what the zipper merge is supposed to accomplish, with both lanes travelling the same speed?  Why is this so-called &quot;vigilante&quot; behaviour being described as bad?  If a driver that&#x27;s smug about their late-merging behaviour being optimal is going noticeably faster in their lane than the lane that merged, doesn&#x27;t that mean that what they&#x27;re doing is exactly <i>not</i> a zipper merge?<p>Perhaps the answer is that the ideal to aim for is not &quot;late&quot; merging, so much as &quot;speed matching&quot; merging: when there is a merge ahead, if you&#x27;re in the faster of the two lanes (whichever one that is!), slow down a smidge <i>now</i> and then you won&#x27;t have to screech to a braking halt at the merge point (and you&#x27;ll also make the flow better for everyone behind you).  Zooming ahead because there&#x27;s a briefly clear section of road may be &quot;late&quot; merging in some sense, but is not the same thing as &quot;zipper&quot; merging and is not improving flow.",1406256435

8083536,comment,8082728,8082728,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Plus le change, plus le meme chose.</i><p>Functional programming has a couple of problems, when it comes to uptake. The first is that you only get 40% of the benefit if you go 90% of the way. (Static typing is the same way, which is why I prefer Clojure&#x27;s typelessness over the mediocre static typing of Java or C++ or Go.) In that case, the &quot;impure&quot; 10% still causes, if not realized complexity, the <i>potential for</i> complexity that infuriates maintainers.<p>If you go 90% of the way on FP and get 40% of the benefits, that still means you&#x27;re writing code faster and generally producing less of it, and those are good things. However, there&#x27;s a nasty duality in programming which is that saving time on the fun stuff means more time is spent on the un-fun stuff. (If you make writing of code 4 times faster and debugging of nasty interface issues 2 times faster, you spend a larger proportion of your time on the latter.) Unless you can eliminate whole classes of un-fun-ness (e.g. categories of bugs) it&#x27;s often not worth it. Eliminating 90% of the un-fun-ness just means you&#x27;re spending more time on that remaining 10%.<p>For example, Python can be used as a mostly functional language and thereby go 90% of the way (conceptually) to FP, but it isn&#x27;t. The community has judged it to be not worth it. Scala <i>should</i> be used for FP, but there are plenty of Java++ programmers who still use <i>null</i> instead of Option[T]. Sadly, it doesn&#x27;t take much of this dysfunctional programming to emasculate FP and leave an unbiased person asking, &quot;Why bother?&quot; It might not even be the right way to go, for a maintenance project. Mixing two styles is going to make it more illegible than using the existing (if suboptimal) style for new changes and work.<p>The career issues noted are also huge. The average Clojure or Haskell developer makes slightly than the average Java developer, but if you control for skill and compare at-level, the Java or C++ developer wins. A 1.8 Java developer (scale here: <a href=""http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/gervais-macleod-23-the-shodan-programmer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2013/04/22/gervais-macle...</a>) makes $175,000 and turns down invitations into VP-level positions at major corporations on a regular basis, because 1.6+ Java developers are just so rare. A 1.8 C++ developer can make $500,000 per year at a hedge fund. The 1.8 Haskell or Clojure developer makes about $125,000 on average, which is not bad but hardly stratospheric. This tends toward a self-perpetuating exaggeration of historical discrepancies in language popularity. Even if the average Haskell job is better, Haskell jobs (at all) are much harder to get, and Haskell jobs that pay as well as even an upper-middle Java job are extremely rare. The market is just stronger for Java people, so that keeps people wanting to use it, which keeps the majority of companies preferring it over better languages because they fear maintenance risk more than low productivity.<p>I&#x27;m less charitable than Wadler on the &quot;they don&#x27;t get it&quot; angle. Certainly there are smart people who &quot;get&quot; functional programming and have good reasons not to use it. Still, I do think that a contributing factor to FP&#x27;s lack of uptake is the anti-intellectualism of the programming world.<p>It&#x27;s not that anti-intellectuals have some natural inclination toward Java or C++. The anti-intellectuals have the general attitude that <i>language doesn&#x27;t matter</i>. And then they pick Java for some risk-averse, enterprisey shitfuck reason like maintenance risk or lack of an available developer pool, both of which are just business stinginess (&quot;we don&#x27;t want to train people&quot;). What makes them vile is not their tastes in languages (there is a lack of taste in the Java community but, even still, there <i>are</i> cases where Java is the absolute right language to use) but the fact that they don&#x27;t take programmers&#x27; concerns (such as tooling choices) seriously at all, and prioritize manager-type concerns over the needs of the people actually doing the fucking work.",1406256031

As long as companies offer a free trial, they should consider the risk that users will take advantage of it to do anything that can be done on a computer, whether that means running proxies, scrapers, or miners.<p>The only plausible issue here is that the &quot;hackers&quot; automated the process, meaning they have no intention to actually convert into paid customers. But surely the companies account for the risk of free trial users not converting to paid. That&#x27;s the whole point of a free trial.<p>The only way to mitigate this is to require a credit card up front for the free trial, which IIRC has been shown to reduce conversions. It&#x27;s likely that reducing conversions by requiring a credit card will cost companies more than they lose from automated scripts signing up to their service.

I&#x27;ll just say this: I think we have very different notions of what &quot;large tech industry&quot; means. I don&#x27;t consider Tampa, FL or just about any of the VA listings to have &quot;large&quot; tech industries. Tampa&#x27;s is especially slim, driven mainly by a couple of hospitals, the university, and a few defense/government contractors. VA&#x27;s are driven mainly by defense/government contractors (having been there once, I&#x27;d not choose it again except as a last resort, and then only reluctantly) and some finance.",1406254145

8083448,comment,8082902,8083211,3,0,kijin,,,"I think your emphasis on the &quot;purpose of data&quot; is spot on, and I agree that it&#x27;s very much needed in this age of &quot;big data&quot; when data collected for one purpose can be easily stored, crunched, and used for completely different purposes. The U.S. sorely needs a similar guideline, if not a hard law.<p>But this has nothing to do with free speech in general. The two issues are orthogonal to each other. They&#x27;re not &quot;basically the same idea&quot;. It&#x27;s entirely possible for a country to regulate the direct collection, use, and distribution of personal information in one way, while regulating free speech in general in another way.<p>My phone company&#x27;s collection of my personal information has little to do with free speech, it&#x27;s a contractual obligation that they incur in exchange for getting my information. It&#x27;s just like when Hertz rents me a car and tells me &quot;you can only use this car for 7 days, you can&#x27;t use it to drive for Uber, and you can&#x27;t sublet it to other people.&quot; Hertz can charge me a hefty fee if I use the car in a way that they disallow. Similarly, I can sue my phone company for damanges (or have the government fine them) if they use my personal information in a way that I disallow. And if the law provides standard rules on what is allowed and what is not, well, that could be convenient for all of us.<p>On the other hand, if someone publishes embarrassing facts about me on their website without my permission, now that&#x27;s a matter of free speech, and whether or not I can tell them to delete those posts should depend on how much actual impact those pieces of information are expected to have on my life and the lives of people around me, as well as the potential impact that a system of censorship might have on the general quality of public life in the country. It&#x27;s probably a good idea to let citizens hide the list of sex toys they bought. It&#x27;s probably not a good idea to let the President hide the list of bribes he took.<p>Since these judgments are cultural, reasonable people can disagree about them. In America, flying a Nazi flag doesn&#x27;t count as a harmful thing, only a disgusting thing. In Germany, due to its unique history, it&#x27;s considered a very harmful thing. But I don&#x27;t think this shows any disagreement &quot;on principle&quot;. Both agree that harmful speech is not protected; even in America, you can be punished for shouting &quot;Fire!&quot; in a crowded theater. Different cultures simply have different ideas about what is harmful.<p>Again, this has nothing to do with the usual collection and use of personal information that your excellent &quot;purpose of data&quot; law is concerned with.",1406253702
