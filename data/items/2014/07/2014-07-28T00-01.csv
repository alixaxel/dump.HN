Text messages also cost me money, so not having to worry about that is another selling point.<p>It also makes scaling their side of the system easier. Instead of having some sort of CRM/SMS gateway system, they can just hook however many Macs they want to to their account, and all messages sent to it will get copied to all of them. This makes it easy to hand off a communication session between agents in a way that&#x27;s transparent to the users of the service.<p>Of course, the downside is that it&#x27;s an Apple-only protocol, so they will be prematurely excluding users of non-Apple devices, but maybe that&#x27;s a tradeoff that the company&#x27;s willing to make at this time.",1406509028

I still have another hundred or so points to go until I am allowed so I&#x27;ll have to settle for explaining to you how much I disagree.<p>Your argument is a logical fallacy that I see a lot, but doesn&#x27;t have a fancy Latin name. It is a combination of appeal to authority and circular reasoning so I&#x27;ll give it a name right now: the Authority Circle. It has the form of:<p>&quot;I believe X person/company/country is doing something dumb/bad/foolish.&quot;<p>&quot;If it wasn&#x27;t a good idea, they wouldn&#x27;t be doing it.&quot;<p>This assumes that person X is smarter than you, therefore the fact that they are choosing to take an action is evidence that it is good. This is a lazy and unconstructive argument and you should be ashamed of yourself. (Unless you are a Wall Street shill doing PR spin. In that case, well done.)<p>So logically your argument is not well formed; what about factually? The behavior we see in investors is incredibly focused on short term gains and why not? There is no benefit to long term success to a public investor. Once the company (a small percentage of) their money is invested in flames out, they can simply invest in another company and drain them dry until it is time to bleed another one. (Hopefully unloading their stock to chumps along the way at the right time, before anyone realizes they are being sold a sick cow.) We know from history that unless government regulates the stock market, it is a short matter of time until the house of cards collapses. Today, the most long-lived publicly-held corporations are the ones where the CEO has the power to say &quot;no&quot; to intense investor demand for short-term gain. (We are waiting to see how long Apple can survive this now that Jobs is gone.) Everything we know tells us &quot;yes, investors are indeed that stupid.&quot;<p>You have offered no new or useful facts or reasoning to this discussion. I give your comment a 0/10 for your unhelpful waste of everyone&#x27;s time.",1406508844

8094553,comment,8094134,8094490,1,0,rayiner,,,"The intention of the statute in Aereo is to cover things that act like cable companies. Similarly, the intention of the 4th amendment is to protect information that people try to keep private. Where I think I disagree with many people on HN is whether it is reasonable to believe that information on the internet as it is structured today is private. It simply wasn&#x27;t designed that way. Our protocols and services leak private data to whoever exercises a little ingenuity in listening to it. Many leak private data by design (data mining for advertising, etc).<p>In other words, I don&#x27;t think the folks designing internet technology should get a free ride for 4th amendment purposes, that any internet technology should be considered private regardless of the technical reality. I think you have to concede that data sent in plain text, protocols that don&#x27;t even try to avoid MITM attacks, services that mine user data, etc, shouldn&#x27;t receive the same protection as services where real effort is taken to keep data private. I think this is educated by the technology and consistent with the intention of the 4th amendment that the expectation of privacy be <i>objectively reasonable.</i>",1406508770

People are using a 100 year old dictionary definition to say racism is just racial prejudice. Wikipedia&#x27;s first sentence says it is racial prejudice AND discrimination. While the US Civil Rights Commission is stronger in saying you have to also subordinate someone based on race. You want to say racism is derived from everyone&#x27;s individual racial prejudice but you miss the economic exploitative motives from 200 years of slavery and group behavior. So let us be clear it is not just personal racial prejudice behind racism. To subordinate someone you really are talking about racial prejudice and discrimination with power backing it based on institutional racism, hence power. Otherwise you are talking about racially based prejudice that is based on the individual and not the group or its historical circumstances. People here want to address racism by lifestyle choices and racism is not fixed by lifestyle but by law, institutional changes, and starting with the recognition of what racism actually is.<p>The newspapers are not going to report on a street riot if I go out by myself on the street and break windows and set fires.

Sanctions always bite someone, but rarely do they hurt leaders. I think often they can help extend a regime&#x27;s grip because it plays into propaganda.<p>Also, if sanctions were imposed generally for dicking about in other countries on dubious pretexts, then nobody would be trading with the UK or US right now. Glass houses and all that.<p>edit - if you want to influence Russia at the moment, either you please Putin, or work out how to get rid of him. Pissing him off won&#x27;t help. He is a very experienced KGB guy who has oversaw the period of Russia returning from a brink of near dissolution to a state that is at least functioning, and people put up with a lot of crap to have something that functions.<p>There are parallels with China here in that the insanity of the Mao years can be used to justify putting up with a lack of political freedom today, on the basis that at least the current leaders aren&#x27;t completely crazy. In Russia, people compare Putin with Yeltsin and think that things could be a lot worse as at least Putin can find his arse with both hands and isn&#x27;t pissed all the time. Is the political version of New Coke.<p>To that end, any sanctions that do not actually destabilise Russia are probably counter productive and any that do destabilise Russia are just plain dangerous.<p>The question we really need to answer quickly is what does Putin actually want. If he is a Napoleon in waiting, we should try and depose him rather than pussyfooting around, whereas if he is merely a bit of a despot but not intent on conquest then it would be better to keep him happy and wait.<p>The Crimea doesn&#x27;t really tell us much on that as it is where the Black Sea fleet has been kept since Potemkin&#x27;s time, and so can be argued as a defensive as much as an offensive move. I am somewhat cheered by Putin&#x27;s apparent lukewarm views towards the separatist movements in eastern Ukraine, though this could be a complete front.<p>I was convinced that he was going to try and force and hold a land corridor to the Crimea and the fact that this has not been done (yet) might indicate that Putin is not so much intent on expansion but is just keeping the whole thing warm to keep folk busy, much like China does with North Korea.

It has it´s own problems dough. Some of this problems are:<p>+Lack of proper warm up (Higher risk of injury)<p>+Lack of proper progression (just go and run), it&#x27;s a dangerous way to stress an untrained cardiovascular system and muscular, esqueletical and connective tissues. They may not be able to manage the sudden stress and something may break.<p>+Lack of technique, running at slow speed is not that demanding, but an all-out sprint will increase the probability of an injury due to improper movement.<p>+Overtraing. Not even Olympic level athletes train all out all the time, the body needs recovery to improve. You give it some stress (not too much, just the least stress necessary) and then leave it to recover, It´s called overcompensation. If you are not training to obtain this overcompensation you are just wasting your time (or amusing yourself with a very high heart rate)<p>The biggest problem with all this fitness trends is that they oversimplify. Steady state low heart rate training has it´s place (creating an aerobic base level, improving technique, improving movement economy, recovery), as interval training does (pushing the anaerobic limit, increasing the VOmax, increasing the work capacity at max aerobic levels). Cardiovascular training is a continuum and isolating it´s parts leads to partial results.<p>To really be effective, they must be used inside a complete program, with volume and intensity progression, to allow the body to adapt progressively to the stress. With recovery periods (weekly monthly and yearly) to allow the body to recover and overcompensate (most interval training systems out there forget to tell people how to recover)<p>This may seem like loosing your time, after all people think that if you push yourself everyday you´ll end being the strongest, and the fastest. But this only leads fast to over training and injury.<p>The best a sedentary person can do is to look for a coach that´s able to create a long term plan adapted to her needs and goals. The plan needs to take care of aerobic-anaerobic progression (with the intervals at it&#x27;s due time), muscular mass with proper care of balancing muscular groups (better muscular mass correlates to better long term health, balanced muscular groups greatly diminish the risk of injury), technique (if needed for the sport), mobility and stretching (if you are tight it´s easier to develop imbalances and to get an injury).<p>It´s complicated, and the knowledge needed to create a good training plan that adapts over time, takes much longer than a weekend certification course.<p>You don´t need a lot of time a week, 3 hours a week can take you very far. If you don´t have time for 3 hours/week to work out it´s better to start thinking in your priorities.<p>And for those who lack the resources for a coach (as it´s my case) there are out there very comprehensive and well thought standard training programs for different sports, put together by professional and national level Coaches in form of books, apps and web sites.<p>Edit: Paragraph arrangement.",1406506377

This can be seen in the aggressive expansion of the EU and of NATO. It is necessary that Russia have scope to influence its neighbors and build partnerships in order for it to be a free and prosperous nation.",1406505972

Yes, these quantities are closely related, but fusion reactors are interested in dense magnetic field, and superconductors often break down after some magnetic field.

Cheap energy is the greatest driver of economic growth and social prosperity the world has ever known. The fact that fossil fuels are becoming increasingly expensive and at the same time destroying the global climate is nothing short of an unmitigated disaster. Anything legitimately capable of reducing energy costs while fighting climate change is rightly hailed as an economic and social miracle.",1406505778
