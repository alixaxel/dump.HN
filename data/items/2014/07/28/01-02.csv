Each section has one plant designated to keep the frequency, sort of a &quot;master plant&quot; that is used to balance instant load. All of these are synchronized across the US using phaser measurement units that are timed to GPS.<p>The other cool thing about AC power is that you can send power based on the relative phase of a node on the grid. This means that a node at a lower AC voltage can send power to another node at a higher voltage by adjusting the relative phase. Mostly this is done by switching capacitor banks at various transmission nodes to adjust the reactive power component at that node.",1406512341

Even if LPP [1], achieves what they are attempting which would be a complete game changer, it would take time to distribute the fusion power plants. Or one of the other projects succeeds, same thing. In addition, the first application of fusion will be for buildings. Most base power comes from coal and natural gas not oil. So I think the Middle East will be okay for awhile. The sort of power plant LPP is developing could theoretically be used for large vehicles (trains, large planes, large ships), but you still need oil for cars, trucks, and plastic. Even then, it will take many years for the vehicle fleet to switch over to fusion or any other non-oil power source.<p>I am not worried.<p>1. <a href=""http://lawrencevilleplasmaphysics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lawrencevilleplasmaphysics.com/</a>",1406509355
