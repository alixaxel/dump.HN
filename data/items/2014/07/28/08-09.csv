It appears that certain themes on HN attract down votes rapidly. Such as:<p>1. Criticising Apple&#x27;s policy on repairability.<p>2. Suggesting that drugs are bad for you.<p>Two pretty pragmatic things on which I have a lot of experience of as a) an electrical engineer who did a lot of work with power conversion, charging and energy efficiency and b) someone who is married to a mental health nurse. Well when you attract a -4 instantly for both comments that suggests that there is a group opinion on HN. Rather than discuss the matter sensibly like adults, the prevailing approach is to quickly down vote a post so it is seen as irrelevant and to push the group think. Perhaps a worse thing to down vote is someone who asks for proof of an argument past an anecdote i.e. &quot;shit or get off the pot&quot;.<p>This is as damn near religion as anything else and is not what I expect from a news site which is primarily technical. I expect a degree of intelligence.<p>Now this is an experiment for me as well because I have another account with the ability to down vote and over 2000 points against it. NEVER have I down voted a single post as I don&#x27;t feel that is appropriate. Unfortunately it appears that anyone with a green label is treated as unfortunate fodder and easy money for the entrenched elite,  the agenda-ists or the company shills (Google, Apple for example which are hard to say something bad about here without attracting down votes).<p>To solve this, I would rather that the down vote link is removed from HN and that if anyone finds content objectionable then they should flag it rather than spank it to oblivion.<p>I understand this forum has extreme moderation and dubious policies regarding such things but there is no excuse to be a pit of elitist assholes of the technical community. That is currently the only badge that HN can wear.<p>I expect better and I&#x27;m sure the majority of people do as well.<p>Reddit has a better moderation policy, a more rational and open minded user base and arguably better technical content in some subreddits. That&#x27;s saying something.<p>I bet this gets down voted or flagged.",1406537930

8095766,comment,8092027,8092357,2,0,deadfoxygrandpa,,,"There are different types of FRP implementations. In Elm terminology, monadic FRP allows the definition of a function join : Signal (Signal a) -> Signal a, which would allow you to dynamically create (and use) Signals at runtime. Now imagine you&#x27;ve defined a function that returns a Signal, like:<p>clickCounter : () -> Signal Int<p>clickCounter _ = count Mouse.clicks<p>What happens if the runtime allows you to dynamically call this function and return separate instances of this click counter? Either the value held by the counter is dependent on when it was created, which breaks purity, or the runtime system has to keep track of every input event it&#x27;s ever received, which is the cause memory usage to forever grow with time.<p>Elm disallows the bind and join functions for Signals in favor of Applicative FRP (if you know Haskell, Elm&#x27;s <~ and ~ operators correspond to the <$> and <*> operators of applicative functors in Haskell.) Other implementations get around this in other ways, such as ignoring purity.<p>Elm&#x27;s creator made this interesting presentation about different ways to resolve the issue: <a href=""http://prezi.com/jqowmkidsrmy/the-taxonomy-of-frp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prezi.com/jqowmkidsrmy/the-taxonomy-of-frp/</a>",1406537695

The type of advertisers that think of their jobs as &quot;relationships with customers.&quot; are not the ones currently advertising online (and by online, I mean anywhere other than Google Search).<p>They type of advertisers that would buy ad-space on a site like Reddit today are definitely thinking &quot;sweet, I suckered ten thousand people to click my ad!&quot; even if not in that language, but they are the ones pouring over CTRs and impressions.<p>The advertisers who actually care about &quot;relationships with customers&quot; are life style brands like, Nike, Coke, Apple, Budweiser, Louis Vuitton, and others, who don&#x27;t actually care if you click through (what does a click mean to Budweiser? Its not like the market of people who want a bud light via. online is particularly large). They are more concerned with the &quot;relationships with customers&quot; and take a great deal of care on how the product received and how the message is delivered.<p>The goal of these advertisers is to deliver a message, with the confidence that their message won&#x27;t be warped by content around it. You just can&#x27;t get that with Reddit.

In all this time obsessing over tactics, strategy, recipes, advice of the ones that made it and so on, &quot;obsessing&quot; in general killed half of the experience.<p>I don&#x27;t like this poker metaphor.

Is there any other web company of that size that you would trust more? Could any one copy this trust within a short amount of time? It&#x27;s rather tragic that in our society this has so little value that you have to think really hard to come up with a monetizing strategy.<p>Also, I think the idea of a &quot;just self-sustaining&quot; reddit, as some people here have pointed out, is rather interesting.\nWhy does it need to grow?

8095702,comment,8094767,8095112,5,0,beefhash,,,"The mods of each subreddit are also what kill it. There are people who squash subreddit names just for the lulz[1]. Furthermore, moderator hierarchy is solely based on the date of when they accepted the moderator invitation, which cannot be changed it any way -- if you want to change the hierarchy, someone at the top needs to remove all moderators and re-invite them in the exact order, making sure not to invite anyone before the previous invitation has been accepted, since the timestamp of when you accepted the invitation, not the timestamp of when you were invited, makes the hierarchy.<p>That system on its own is atrocious, but reddit admins also will leave subreddits suffering from moderator abuse to rot, suggesting to split the userbase by having those not happy with the status quo create a new subreddit. While this is common practice on IRC networks, too, they have more differentiated systems.<p>Rizon provides a channel takeover policy, which is based on people with minimal access actively requesting foundership over a channel[2], implying that they do care. reddit has /r/redditrequest, but it has intransparent times for how long a reddit request is allowed to stay unanswered, and you can&#x27;t &quot;skip&quot; moderators higher in the moderation list[3], unlike Rizon&#x27;s takeover policy, where you can do so if nobody else claims the channel during the three-day grace period. Undernet has a very strict timeout on channel managers (or founders), 21+ days of inactivity allows for a vote by the highest-ranking ops for a new manager[4].<p>reddit is thus intentionally staying in the past, refusing to deal with a long-standing issue, for which proposals have been made numerous times.<p>Now, the nice thing about paying money for a subreddit name (which, given the current size of reddit, cannot possibly hold worth comparable to a good domain name) is that it requires a commitment. At least someone on the moderation staff will have to actually shell out money, a limited resource. Instead of solving the moderation/subreddit squashing issue through the way of administrator intervention/software development, which has repeatedly been ignored (search for &quot;mod&quot; on /r/ideasfortheadmins for a bit), it could be solved through requiring active commitment.<p>Similarly, IRC networks are all run by volunteers who don&#x27;t get paid for their work, and there are people paying money to keep servers running. While this completely breaks the subreddit <-> IRC channel analogy I&#x27;ve been making above, it still needs to be said. It&#x27;s not like <i>doing</i> things for free implies that you <i>get</i> things for free.<p>As for reddit getting backlash over changes? Just check the last two /r/changelog posts, full of angry comments[5]. I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re going to care, so what&#x27;s there to stop them from charging money for subreddit names?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1wvx09/subreddit_squatting_a_phenomenon_where_users/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/1wvx09/subreddi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://forum.rizon.net/showthread.php?3850-Channel-Takeover-Policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.rizon.net/showthread.php?3850-Channel-Takeover-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/wiki/faq</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://cservice.undernet.org/docs/guidelines.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cservice.undernet.org/docs/guidelines.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/2a32sq/experimental_reddit_change_subreddits_may_now/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/2a32sq/experiment...</a> and <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/27f3a3/reddit_change_temporary_bans/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/27f3a3/reddit_cha...</a>",1406536022

A diagram like this [1] can be used to illustrate the issue.  Although this diagram is from a hypothetical UK modeling exercise for 2020, the broader point it makes is valid.  On the diagram we see how daily electricity demand follow a predictable daily curve, and the different sources of electricity that are used to meet that demand.  We see that electricity from nuclear and coal provide the most stable component, whereas power from wind (green) varies hugely in time.  Gas power, which can be turned on and off quickly, is used to fill the gaps in demand.  At times, there is almost enough wind that no generation from fossil fuels is necessary, but at other times most of the electricity has to come from burning gas (I&#x27;ve seen similar scenario graphs where wind occasionally fills more than 100% of the demand, but still gas power will be needed for a large component of the energy mix when integrating over time).<p>The point is that without some incredible advance in energy storage capability on a scale that is not on the radar today, we are stuck with an energy system where a significant component needs to be non-solar and non-wind.  From a climate perspective, the best options would then be nuclear electricity or electricity from fossil fuel plans equipped with CCS technology (which is now belatedly emerging).<p>(Disclaimer: I work with CCS-related technology development).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.timera-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Hourly-Renewables-Penetration.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timera-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Hour...</a><p>(link to page from which picture is taken: <a href=""http://www.timera-energy.com/uk-power/getting-to-grips-with-intermittency/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.timera-energy.com/uk-power/getting-to-grips-with-...</a>",1406535021

HTS such as YBCO have several attractive properties besides their less-cryogenic operating temperature such as higher max current per area (the &#x27;critical current density&#x27;). But since HTS are generally ceramic in nature, they can&#x27;t be straightforwardly worked and extruded to form wire in the way that &#x27;conventional&#x27; metallic superconductors like NbTi can.<p>So what they&#x27;re proposing is to make relatively small sections of cable which can be made by simple stacks of conductor. Then they&#x27;ll join them together in the final assembly by soldering. This of course is much easier than trying to wind one massive coil in one go, but now you have a plethora of conventionally-conducting joints between sections, which will heat up under operation. They argue that removing some additional heat at the HTS operating temperature of 20 K is preferable to having to cool to 4 K for conventional superconductors, which sounds reasonable.<p>However I feel that this is tough to support on the mechanical front. Energized magnets want to move, and you can&#x27;t let them move because that leads to heat production, which leads to quenching. You need structure to keep them from moving. So in addition to the electrical connections, you need lots of structural steel and welds. You&#x27;ve got a bunch of stuff in there with different expansion coefficients, so making it work out in practice should be challenging. The LHC program was set back over a year due to overheating in one bad magnet splice.",1406534606

I would like to see guaranteed financial ruin for any of the executives involved in a potential Fukushima and shareholders totally wiped out.<p>That still wouldn&#x27;t put much of a dent in cleanup costs, but it would prevent moral hazard somewhat.<p>This subsidy also never shows up on any models comparing solar, coal and nuclear. Similarly neither does global warming induced environmental catastrophe.<p>BECAUSE you simply can&#x27;t put a $ price on the likelihood of these events occurring or their cost they (the OP modelers) just ignore the tail risk.<p>Anybody who remembers the events of the financial crisis should find that pattern disturbingly familiar.<p>But, doing so is useful if you&#x27;re shilling for natural gas/nuclear energy - just as assuming away financial tail risk was useful for executives at AIG.",1406534514
