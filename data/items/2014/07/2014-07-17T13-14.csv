8047533,comment,8046568,8046836,3,0,gglitch,,,"While my brief comment history will confirm that I completely agree with your analysis of Orwellian vs. Huxleyan dystopias, and agree completely about the greater relevance of Huxley&#x27;s vision to our cultures, I&#x27;d nevertheless be reluctant to equate sexual liberation with Huxley&#x27;s fears. You&#x27;re absolutely right about his having written about sexual indulgence in that way, and about pleasure-seeking being the opiate that destroys his population&#x27;s ability to reflect meaningfully on life; but there&#x27;s something to be said for finding the best expression of human nature and removing its impediments too. Pleasure corrupts, but so does frustration and repression.<p>What&#x27;s to be desired is a culture that educates its individuals about how to safely and virtuously find their own happiness with a minimum of self-indulgent excess or Victorian hand-wringing. A more sexually liberated culture isn&#x27;t necessarily a step in the wrong direction, though the pendulum could certainly swing too far.",1405605579

I really meant for the kind of driving you&#x27;d do every day, the cars are on par, but in raw performance, cars like the M5 and C63 AMG absolutely destroy the Model S P85+.<p>That video is a fluke. In (instrumented) test after test, the M5 is over 1 second faster 0-60, and more than 2 seconds faster down the quarter mile. That might not sound like a lot, but imagine a car drives by at 100+ MPH, now count...<p>one-thousand-one<p>one-thousand-two<p>How far down the road is that car now? That&#x27;s the distance between an M5 and a 85P+ in the quarter mile.<p>There is a realm of performance at the very top end where the dino-powered engine still has an advantage. Electrics can achieve the same performance, but you&#x27;re fighting an up-hill battle to get there. You have to make too many compromises along the way [1] in order to beat them. Right now, at least. It&#x27;ll be slow coming, but I believe the transition to electric advantage is coming.<p>1: Here&#x27;s an example of an extremely compromised all-out electric that is capable of beating its petrol powered equivalent.

It&#x27;s one of the few things I&#x27;ve built that I use every single day.<p>My project, Cryptasia (www.cryptasia.com), uses a Google Spreadsheet as a data-source where each line defines a single set of generation parameters: the allowed character set, number of characters, domain name, hash seed, and name of the key. When you pick a service (e.g. gmail) and enter your passphrase, it creates a password for you using that unique combination. It also hashes the passphrase and displays an image based on what you typed, so if you recognize your image, you know you typed it properly. Some advantages of using a data-source like this are that it can be entirely client-hosted (the google doc need not be public) and you can regenerate your password for a site at any time just by changing the seed.<p>One interesting difference in OP&#x27;s implementation is the use of a PIN as well as a passphrase.

At the time we had this discussion, he was the CFO of a company that had over 30,000 employees globally.<p>His thinking was that the same principals that small companies use (not hiring too quickly, etc.) should be scaled up regardless of the company size. You either need people or you don&#x27;t. You don&#x27;t hire too fast simply because you are experiencing rapid revenue growth, because revenues do not grow unabated. You hire as slowly as you can, so that when recessions hit or market forces change, you don&#x27;t suddenly have 3 or 4 times the staff you need. His thinking (which I agree with) is that since those people worked extra hard to cover the work when times were booming, you don&#x27;t turn around and lay them off just because things slow for a couple of years.<p>Those people worked hard for the company because they are good employees; he saw it as more important to have good employees on hand when things ramped up again rather than just cut them loose and hope he could get more good employees later.<p>Since that discussion, he&#x27;s gone on to two more companies, leading one through an IPO as the CEO. All of his companies have operated like gangbusters - he comes in, revenues go through the roof, debt gets paid down and he&#x27;s NEVER LAID ANYONE OFF. In the meantime, in his work history, he&#x27;s been through 3 IPOS (two as CFO, one as CEO) and I don&#x27;t know how much he made personally on each I do know that he cleared $41 million in a single day on one of them.<p>This is in complete opposition to what I&#x27;ve heard from several other CEOs, who tell me &#x27;labor is your most controllable expense&#x27;. Yet, none of their companies (some also on the NYSE or NASDAQ) have performed anywhere near what my friend&#x27;s has.<p>I think he&#x27;s right. Wall Street is full of guys who have no actual experience running a business. They see layoffs as &#x27;cleaning house&#x27; and &#x27;cutting expenses&#x27; but the reality is that while that can be true, it more often is a harbinger that the company is not well run.",1405604291

The officer has a gun, and the unfortunate power to make &quot;extra-legal&quot; killings with it. They&#x27;re safe. If they irresponsibly use that gun in an unsafe manner, like all the drunken NYPD officers who shoot people[0], then it absolutely is our or someone&#x27;s responsibility to take matters into our own hands and monitor ourselves until we see that accountability. Relying on internal affairs/review commissions to provide that is a broken model.<p>Also, I know folks doing this locally, and have watched officers request that filmers stand at a safe distance. It&#x27;s interesting to me how often &quot;safe distance&quot; corresponds with a) somewhere with a shitty view far away and b) a position where the filmer is significantly further away than a number of pedestrians or gawkers whose &quot;safety&quot; presumably isn&#x27;t in dispute. I have good friends who were arrested for nothing more than filming, and they were often given confusing and contradictory orders by an officer who obviously felt he had the immediate situation well enough in hand to direct most of his attention ordering the filmer around. It happened almost 2 years ago, no charges were filed, and if this was a legitimate concern then I&#x27;d really like to see some obstruction charges brought in the several local cases I&#x27;ve seen of citizens arrested for filming.<p>I do agree that some of these groups&#x27; strategies are a bit busted. I&#x27;m familiar with the Peaceful Streets Project here in Austin, and sometimes the ragey/personal rhetoric got a bit overpowering. Then again, cops kill people, often under suspicious circumstances, and get away with it.

Changing a password (e.g. after a leak) requires one to us a different door id. Which then leads to remembering the appropriate ID for the currently-valid password. To properly mitigate this I guess the only option is to sort-of go back to traditional password managers by having a lookup table door id to enter → door id that is used to generate the password.",1405603136
