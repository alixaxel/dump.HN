That means there will be no employment because most people would not need to work to meet their basic needs. People would work on things if they felt like so. There won&#x27;t be shortage of fuel and transportation because material become ultra cheap and making copies of vehicles would be done by automated factories. Robots would run almost entire operations, they themselves can be mass produced like soap because building them is cheaper and they would have lot of energy available to themselves to virtually do anything.<p>There won&#x27;t be wars on tiny land disputes because you can virtually fly anywhere and settle yourself with most modern amnesties in your giant mention built mostly by robots anywhere you like, including in the Antartica or in depth of seas or middle of Neveda.<p>I know you are already raising your eyebrows over this because one can argue that we can also easily vaporize our own planet and robots can take over the world. Yes, sure. My theory is that there is certain kind of maturity required for species before it can attain &quot;unlimited energy&quot; prize from the nature. We have became more and more civilized over the centuries as we have gotten more and more power starting from rocks to swords to guns to basic atomic energy. We now have recognition for sovereign countries and aggressors gets punished by mutual boycotts. There will be no more Chengiz Khan or Alekzanders - they are all simply artifacts of our history where we consider their acts as unnecessarily <i>barbaric</i>.<p>So there will be a day when human kind would be culturally ready and I think that day will align with invention of unlimited energy source - may even just direct conversion of mass to energy (fusion is really not <i>that</i> efficient).",1406525655

An Uber came within 2min of us calling it, approximately the right time, and we were a bit distracted.  Walked over to the town car displaying the U logo, and I don&#x27;t recall exactly, but somehow &quot;You&#x27;re Marc, right?&quot; got exchanged, and we got in.<p>The driver was confused about &quot;Hotel Pennsylvania&quot;, which was funny since it is a huge hotel, but he said there was a smaller Penn Hotel or something nearby which he thought we&#x27;d meant.<p>We got closer to the location, but still maybe halfway, and Marc got a call from the <i>real</i> Uber driver asking where the fuck he was.  He pointed out we&#x27;d gotten into the Uber already, and it was clear it was the wrong Uber; we assumed it was just someone else&#x27;s Uber by mistake.  That&#x27;s happened a few times before in high-volume locations, including one where the 2 cars were from the same livery company in SF and had off-by-one license plates (ours got stolen by someone else); Uber deals with this pretty gracefully for all concerned.<p>We pointed this out to the driver.  Told him to start the meter now, as a new ride (which we&#x27;d request); this would be approximately the correct fare, and I was going to give the guy $5-10 extra in cash to be nice.  (The whole trip was approximately minimum-uber-black fare distance anyway.)<p>He acted like he was trying, and failed; we then got to the location, and he demanded cash.  We pushed back (the whole reason for using uber is not to deal with cash, and expense reimbursement), but said if he&#x27;d give us a receipt, that would be fine.  He refused.  This went on a little.<p>I got out of the car to go inside at this point, assuming Marc would deal with it; I was mostly trying to make sure we got our speaker badges before the desk closed.  I wish I&#x27;d stayed to film the resulting interaction, in retrospect.<p>After this, the guy actually locked the doors, got out, and then went to my friend&#x27;s door.  He threatened to cut him. (I&#x27;m not sure on the details; this is secondhand.)  He unlocked it, my friend got out.  He&#x27;s a ~350+ pound ex-bouncer from Manchester, and head of security for Defcon.  The driver is a ~120 pound south asian gentleman.  Words were exchanged very briefly; the driver gave up and left, unpaid.<p>I tweeted to @ubernyc, then per their request mailed support, and they replied, but proceeded to do fuck all, as far as I can tell.<p>We failed as security professionals for not getting dox on the car or driver, but we were pretty distracted.  I would have been really upset had this happened to someone who could have felt physically threatened by the driver.<p>Uber needs some superior authentication system for drivers; btle or wifi or flashing indicators on the phones themselves would be nice.  Ultrasonic tones on microphone/speaker might work.<p>I&#x27;m used to fearing kidnapping and extortion by drivers (Middle East, Thailand, etc.), but not so much in NYC.",1406524853

As engineers, we have a lot of power to help the people of North Korea. Our goal should be a constant funnel of information from the outside world, just as this radio provides (albeit in a limited capacity). Free flow of information is not only incredibly powerful, but also relatively cheap to spread. It should be our job to find ways to spread it into North Korea.<p>With Google and Facebook&#x27;s balloon/drone internet access programs, I suspect the availability of Internet -- and subsequently information -- in North Korea is only going to grow. In preparation for this, we should be developing solutions that enable cheap, surreptitious reception of information/internet for North Koreans. I would like to see organizations like LiNK (liberty in North Korea) get far more attention, and use that publicity to recruit engineering partnerships.<p>If we -- engineers, startups, big tech co&#x27;s (the collective engineering community) -- pool together our knowledge and resources, partnering with organizations like LiNK, then we can drive real grassroots change within North Korea.<p>I don&#x27;t know exactly what the immediate next steps are, but it&#x27;s clear to me that from a humanitarian perspective, North Korea is an open field where tech can generate far more progress than it can in developed countries, where solving first world problems adds comparatively little to general well-being. One thing I know for sure, is that leadership on this front needs to come from the big tech companies. Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft all have thousands of talented engineers, billions of dollars, and incredible resources at their disposal. Yet not one of them has done a single thing to advance the cause of liberty in North Korea. Why not?<p>While Western governments are busy sitting on their hands, too scared of China to make any aggressive moves in North Korea, it should be the tech companies -- those at the forefront of engineering and human progress -- who are leading the charge.<p>Who&#x27;s going to step up?",1406524611

But man, what a terrible mobile experience. A few weeks ago your site was almost completely broken on mobile, and now it&#x27;s only marginally better. Anyone who lands on it wants to go immediately to the hacks, and click through them. This should be as simple as repeatedly clicking the infographic, and yet it requires a far more complicated process of moving the screen around, tapping in the corner, moving it back around, etc. It&#x27;s incredibly painful.<p>I would recommend making the mobile optimized layout almost 100% the infographic, and make it clickable. Or add a thumbs up/down button to proceed to the next. Get rid of anything on the screen that&#x27;s not content. But as of now, the mobile experience is one of the worst I&#x27;ve seen.
