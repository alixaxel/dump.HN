7999182,comment,7996980,7998832,3,0,dragonwriter,,,"> It&#x27;s a technical term so the colloquial definition has little relevance to it&#x27;s use in computing. You can read the definition in TAPL or PFPL.<p>Technical books often define terms in a way convenient for the material and approach they are presenting, not in a way that is general to the field; particularly, if terms are used in different ways within the field at the time they are written, they typically have to choose for consistency within the book -- that doesn&#x27;t make that definition the right one for the field, it simply means that&#x27;s what the term means in the context of the work.<p>And, ultimately, the semantic argument is meaningless. It doesn&#x27;t really matter whether you have static and dynamic types in different languages or you call the former &quot;types&quot; and the latter &quot;tags&quot; (except that the former terminology actually <i>explains</i> the difference in a way that tells you what the difference is every time you use the terms.) The substance is the same, and getting worked up over line-drawing regarding the boundary of &quot;type&quot; is a distraction from any discussion of substance.",1404745106

Like seeing a lot of indentation without meaningful code in between?<p>Or am I getting this wrong? Is it really possible to establish a &quot;score&quot; of sorts for how the code looks without actually looking at what it does?<p>If it is, then it would seem like an interesting idea to build a code &quot;shape-analyzer&quot; that would give you the same type of analysis.

7999179,comment,7996452,7996807,1,0,downandout,,,"While your point is valid, after US v. Booker, federal sentencing guidelines became exactly that - <i>guidelines</i>.  The actual maximum punishments are defined by statute. If you catch a federal judge on a bad day, he or she can indeed sentence a defendant to the maximum allowed by statute for each count, and run all of them consecutive to each other.  This is how some defendants wind up with multi-century federal sentences.<p>Example: Shalom Weiss was sentenced to 845 years in prison for a white collar crime (current projected release date: November 23, 2754).  One of his co-defendants received 750 years. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholam_Weiss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholam_Weiss</a><p>This rarely happens, however, and likely would not have happened in this case.  More likely than not, he would have accepted a plea and wound up doing probation or a very light sentence (~6 months) in a minimum security prison.

In fact, I&#x27;ve experience most of the popular complaints about the device listed. In my summary I mention I was leaning towards keeping it, but that&#x27;s by a slight margin, the battery issue just pushed it into &quot;one too many problems&quot; area for me to deal with on a device that I would use for the following 2-3 years.<p>I did list the solution to the pen sensitivity; Wintab driver. Didn&#x27;t get a chance to try any of the wifi solution before it died though.<p>>You&#x27;re buying a new kind of device with a new OS on it, and you&#x27;re disappointed it&#x27;s different from what you already know?<p>I&#x27;ve used Windows 7 for a over a year at work at work and loved it. I bought a Windows 8 desktop for my parent&#x27;s a year ago and used it for about 4 months. Mostly used in desktop mode because Metro just confused my parents (they&#x27;re not the most tech savvy, but they&#x27;re used to the desktop version for about 8-10 years). So I actually have more than just 2 weeks on the OS experience.<p>I actually love the 2 in 1 tablet/pc, I told my friend that yesterday as well after he read the review. The hardware design is actually pretty solid, but the UI/software experience on it has been below par in almost all instances. I probably would cut them more slack on it thinking &quot;O it&#x27;s a brand new device, software probably isn&#x27;t optimize for touchscreens&quot;, but then I thought &quot;hold on, haven&#x27;t ultrabooks with touch screens been out for over a years now...and isn&#x27;t this the 3rd version of the Surface?&quot;<p>>This could have been an interesting review with some tips for other owners, but as it stands it seems more like spitting venom.<p>What kind of tips would you have liked to hear? (serious question). Always looking to improve and if you thought it could have been more helpful in area I&#x27;m more than receptive in those criticisms.<p>EDIT: Also would like to add. One of the big factors on returning the device comes down to return policy as well. It&#x27;s 30 days. So this is a commitment of ~$1400, more than a month&#x27;s rent for me. The device is suppose to be an investment , something that I can rely on for the next few years, and so far my confidence in it just isn&#x27;t where it needs to be to stay with the device. Money is a pretty big issue, I assume so for most consumers paying this much for a device.",1404744852

7999151,comment,7994673,7995262,2,0,mercer,,,"Ha, I do pretty much the same!<p>After a lot of tinkering I settled on switching between two &#x27;modes&#x27; that in combination make me feel good not just about my days, but also about my weeks and months (not sure about years yet - we&#x27;ll see!). Took me a while to get there.<p>One mode is the &#x27;many tabs open, free association&#x27; mode. It&#x27;s the time when I print articles that I want to annotate on any one of the many (disparate) topics that I am deeply interested in. It&#x27;s the time when I read a book, go to specific or general events.  It&#x27;s the time where I read tons of articles that tickle my fancy (and that&#x27;s a lot, and not all useful). I&#x27;ve organically developed a process for filtering this overload of information. Much of it goes into an &#x27;information gathering&#x27; program, some of it I process manually, and some of it I hang on walls or leave, printed out, around the house, and might percolate in some central document or database.<p>I call this my &#x27;information gathering&#x27; mode.<p>The other mode consists of working and obsessively tinkering with something. Often this is a framework, particular script or little app. It&#x27;s a lot of coding, reading and &#x27;comprehending&#x27; to the point mild headaches, late nights, lots of coffee, and forgetfulness (no leaving the house, or no shaving, sometimes). A few weeks, for example, I simultaneously dove into Koa.js (without even being very well versed in node.js), React.js, and agonized over the ideal server-side/client-size approach for React. I also tried a bunch of other &#x27;reactive&#x27; approaches and somehow found myself reading up on Haskell beyond the random HN article I would find.<p>I call this my &#x27;obsessive tinkering&#x27; mode, although tinkering doesn&#x27;t always do it justice. It&#x27;s always immensely useful, even if I never use whatever stack/framework/language/topic I dive into.<p>I find that over time I tend to be in one mode predominantly, and switch to the other mode intermittently. If I ever get stuck in one mode, bad things eventually happen.<p>In a way I try to model myself after the (possibly highly romanticized) image of the &#x27;renaissance man&#x27; who seems to just have a great amount of curiosity and knowledge, and then translates this to obsessive projects, and occasionally applies this just to make money. This approach seems workable, for now, in this tech world I inhabit, and I&#x27;ve never been so happy (but YMMV).",1404744802

The common theme is that they have better things to do. That&#x27;s fine too. Not everyone is interested in digging into combinatorial algorithms and why should they be? We all have varying levels of interest in the field. It only seems reasonable that you should be able to use what you need of it to get your tasks done.<p>You certainly don&#x27;t need the plethora of front-end frameworks and tools to make a good site today.

7999111,comment,7996980,7997323,15,0,tel,,,"One of Harper&#x27;s arguments (the author here) is dogmatic and perhaps compelling from a aesthetic point of view. Let me try not to butcher it too badly in what follows.<p>He believes a few things that in concert arrive at the idea that typed languages are the only interesting point in the design space thus uncovered.<p>He begins by first rigorously defining what he means by &quot;type&quot;. In particular, it&#x27;s a piece of information computed statically (i.e. using the syntax of a program alone, nothing of its &quot;runtime&quot;) which constrains the eventual values the dynamics must take. A &quot;type-safe&quot; program is thus one where the dynamics correspond to the predictions of the statics—in particular, a program respects its type as it operates and the program &quot;does not get stuck&quot; i.e. does not hit an undefined state.<p>From here he notes the power of union types, types which are &quot;either&quot; A or B. Given a sufficiently large union type, one which reads &quot;either this or that or this or that&quot; for every possible result value of running a program then you can create a &quot;safe&quot; semantics for any language using this type—every program has this giant union type and every choice of dynamics ends up in this giant union type. He then notes that while this genuinely is &quot;type safe&quot; it&#x27;s kind of boring. Further, all &quot;dynamically typed&quot; languages inherit this boringness since they expose no &quot;interesting&quot; static structure.<p>(Even if you dislike the argument above, and there&#x27;s plenty that might cause someone to dislike it, it&#x27;s worth noting that this line of thought arrives very smoothly at the concept of &quot;hybrid typing&quot; being explored by things like Typescript and Facebook&#x27;s Hack.)<p>One of the primary things you could argue with at this point is that having more sophisticated types is interesting and valuable. To this end Harper focuses on what he calls the &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; of logic, type theory, and category theory. The idea is backed by the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence which shows that each of these fields is but an image of the other two. In Harper&#x27;s (paraphrased) words: you know that something is genuine and lasting if you can show it exists in every branch of the Holy Trinity.<p>So he declares basically by fiat that things which reflect the Holy Trinity are interesting and things which do not are not. Obviously you can levy many arguments to disagree with him here.<p>But it&#x27;s hard to declare that the things discovered in the Holy Trinity are boring. This is where cutting edge research on things like Homotopy Type Theory and general Dependent Types live. This produces compelling arguments to back up why &quot;null pointers are a billion dollar mistake&quot; [0] or why if-branching and booleans lack meaningful providence [1]. These ideas, even if they are stripped of their Ivory Tower gleam, are what are slowly percolating into mainstream languages with names like &quot;Enum&quot;++ in Swift and &quot;Optional&quot; in Java.<p>---<p>Generally, to finally provide my personal take, I think that Harper is dead right so long as you consider programming languages to be &quot;means of expression&quot;. I think that&#x27;s an interesting POV on languages generally and it&#x27;s not totally at odds with the more everyday POV that languages are &quot;tools for creation&quot;. But they are sometimes at odds since they place the brunt of what they demand of a language at different places. Ultimately, if Harper&#x27;s program is successful many years from now we&#x27;ll all use shadows of whatever futuristic grade of dependently typed language gives us maximal expressiveness while nesting it in an ecosystem of tooling and libraries which aid construction of interesting things. I have no idea if Harper&#x27;s &quot;one true language&quot; exists, but it does seem like increasingly the world is moving that way... thus Harper&#x27;s enthusiasm about Swift and Rust.<p>[0] <a href=""http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/Null+References:+The+Billion+Dollar+Mistake"" rel=""nofollow"">http://qconlondon.com/london-2009/presentation/Null+Referenc...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/boolean-blindness/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://existentialtype.wordpress.com/2011/03/15/boolean-blin...</a>",1404744343

I count at least four: aerospike nozzle, methane fuel, autogenous pressurization (whatever they mean by that), and all-composite structure. That would seem to be a path to spending lots of time and money on research.<p>To be fair, composites and aerospikes are well-tested, and methane has some good qualities and no obvious problems as a rocket fuel. (I don&#x27;t know what they intend for pressurization; perhaps they want to boil both fuel and oxidizer to create pressure? Seem like a non-standard technique anyway.) And it&#x27;s not like you can buy rocket hardware OTS, so everything you do is a development project. But none has flown on a real vehicle. Picking one would be ambitious. Four just seems like compounded risk.<p>Scaled Composites has had plenty of trouble with their seemingly-simple hybrid engine. You may think a technology is researched enough or simple enough to use without much danger, but rocketry is an extreme environment and can hold lots of surprises at scale and in the margins.<p>SpaceX, on the other hand, has only done one really revolutionary thing: cost discipline.

7999039,comment,7997268,7998268,4,0,KMag,,,"The OP described the original offline PIN system.  My memory is a bit fuzzy, but my recollection is that the original ATM PIN system was designed for offline verification and didn&#x27;t allow user-selectable PINs.  There was a tamper-resistant chip that encrypted the account number with single DES (using a system-wide fixed key) and took the first 16 bits of the result.  There was a 16 entry table that mapped nybbles to keypad digits, and this was used to non-invertibly map the 16 bits nyble by nyble to a 4 digit decimal number.  The interface to the tamper-resistant hardware module took in the 4-digit PIN and the account number and spat back out pass/fail, to minimize the utility of stealing an ATM.  I probably got some of the details a bit wrong, but that&#x27;s the gist of the system.<p>Soon after rollout, enough customers complained about wanting to set their own PINs that they added a 4 digit offset field to the magnetic stripe.  The offset from the stripe was added to the user-entered PIN, and the least significant 4 digits were sent to the hardware verifier.  That way the hardware verifier didn&#x27;t need to be changed.  The only way to change the PIN was by physically bringing the card to the bank.  As I said, the details are probably a bit wrong, but it went something like that.<p>I read about one attack where the 16 entry nyble-to-digit mapping wasn&#x27;t authenticated very well, so attackers could steal an ATM, then trick the hardware module into loading a mapping that mapped 0-7 to &quot;0&quot; and 8-F to &quot;1&quot;, then bruit force the PINs for a bunch of cards.  Then they&#x27;d change the mapping to 0-3 -> &quot;0&quot;, 4-7 -> &quot;1&quot;, 8-B -> &quot;2&quot;, C-F -> &quot;3&quot;. After two more rounds of this, they could use the production mapping of nybles to keypad digits.  For each round, it takes an average of 8 guesses and a maximum of 16 guesses to guess the PIN with the PIN.  (Information gained from one round is fed forward to the next round&#x27;s guesses.)  There are four rounds, so an average of 32 guesses and a maximum of 64 guesses to extract a PIN.  Once the PINs were bruit-forced using the stolen ATM, they could be brought to a real ATM, even though the attack wasn&#x27;t able to extract any information about the DES key used by the system.<p>A later system had a tamper-resistant module that used 3DES to encrypt modem traffic between the bank and the ATM.  Changing 3DES keys involved two different employees being physically present at the the ATM.  Each employee would load their key-change info and enter their PIN.  A combination of a master 3DES key and the employee&#x27;s PIN would be used only inside the tamper-resistant module to decrypt the key change information.  The key change info from the two employees would be XOR&#x27;d together to get the new modem 3DES key and a keyed cryptographic message authentication code (MAC) over the new modem 3DES key.  Only if the new MAC checked out would the new modem 3DES key replace the old modem 3DES key.  This way, no one employee ever had enough information to learn the new 3DES modem key, even if they somehow stole the master 3DES key used to encrypt the key change information.  As I said, I may have had the details a bit wrong, but it&#x27;s none the less very well thought out.<p>These days, I would hope ATMs use something similar to Kerberos tunneled over TLS with pinned certificates so that just breaking the public key algorithm or just stealing the Kerberos shared secret isn&#x27;t sufficient to read the traffic or spoof communications.  The bandwidth required for an ATM is so low that doubling the encryption overhead vs. TLS isn&#x27;t a big deal.<p>Anyway, I&#x27;ll try and dig up the paper on the attack on the poor authentication of the nyble-to-decimal mapping in the tamper-resistant chip.  It was quite an interesting read.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the paper was the main subject of a Slashdot article in the early 2000s.",1404743738

7999027,comment,7996798,7998097,8,0,legutierr,,,"SWIFT refers to the network used in sending standard international bank wires, which I am contrasting to the family remittance network, an ad hoc network that links entities that facilitate the capture and delivery of international family remittances.<p>Sending a standard international bank wire will cost $30-$50 typically, not $5-$10.  I don&#x27;t really know how that price is &quot;justified&quot; as such, except to say that any bank account that is sending international wires increases the AML compliance cost of that account for a bank, and because surprising aspects of the bank wire transfer system are manual, a human being will frequently need to get involved.  I would imagine that the incremental cost of sending a bank wire is frequently tiny compared to the cost, but it probably varies significantly from bank to bank (for some, it might even be a loss-leader).<p>The fees associated with sending a wire via the more ad hoc family remittance network are determined by a competitive marketplace, and are typically $5-$10.  Providers are not all banks (although banks do get involved in a large percentage of transactions) and include non-bank companies like Western Union, MoneyGram and Xoom, and smaller players like ViaAmericas (mentioned in the article).  People who send money will shop around for the best deal (often, different services are offered within the same retail agent location), and senders will from one month to the next switch providers if the FX rate is better, or if the fees are lower.  The bank oligopoly holds no sway here, and if prices could be lower, they would be lower.<p>Your reaction is a typical one, and one that I remember encountering repeatedly: &quot;why do these transactions cost anything at all?&quot;  The truth is, there are significant costs that underlie a family remittance transaction.  At least half of transaction fees, and often 80%, are claimed by the retail agents that capture or pay out the remittance.  There, you have all of the costs associated with retail, combined with the costs of handling large amounts of cash.  On the capture side, many banks will charge retail locations a percentage fee for processing the cash they deposit, and if armored car services are used, they will also change fees for handling.  On the payment side, logistical challenges may be even greater, given local conditions.<p>The amount of money that remains goes to pay for secure and highly-available computer systems, AML compliance processes (which require a significant amount of human involvement), other regulatory compliance costs (security, bonding, record-keeping, reporting, examination fees and assessments), fraud coverage, customer service costs (a call center must be maintained), marketing, and general corporate overhead.  Really, what you would imagine it would take to run a remittance network if you thought about it.<p>If you compare remittance fees as a percentage of a typical US-Mexico transaction ($5 to send $350), they are comparable to other retail payment transactions that involve similar levels of risk and require similar infrastructure.  However, volumes are much, much lower than ATM or credit card transactions, so economies of scale yield a much lower benefit, which also adds to the cost.",1404743645

The Problem with too many frameworks - they all try to do (promise) too much. Thus creating too many unnecessary complexities. Jamun was designed for the rest of us. \nJamun abstracts all of the above so you can really concentrate on what you do best - CREATE cool Cloud-ready apps. \nCreate backend without any code. \nJamun makes the server as dumb as possible (from a frontend perspective) - by putting most presentation logic on client, without compromising integrity and security on the backend server.\nJamun minimize unnecessary back-and-forth traffic between server and client. \nWith the advent of client based apps like HTML5, many security issues have arose, e.g. client spoofing. Jamun allays those concerns without any programming via field level security.\nSome of the highlights of the features of Jamun:\nZero or no server code.\nServer-side JavaScript and Java.\nClear separation of concerns between client and server - that is the server is 100% Web Services API and therefore there is no exclusive View binding. One can use the same backend resource for multiple frontends or apps. The server is client agnostic.\nAbstraction to the underlying frontend. This means less client side code changes in the event of a frontend change.\nScalable - Event-driven - Non-blocking architecture.\nSingle-page client model.\nEasy App Deploy and Update with App Manager GUI.\nDesigned from the ground-up for Cloud environments.\nCoding is fun once again!",1404743468

Just because I don&#x27;t believe what you claim, doesn&#x27;t mean I believe the opposite. I don&#x27;t know, and as far as I can tell, you don&#x27;t either. And it&#x27;s irrelevant anyhow, as people might just not be receiving a representative sample of the emails out there, so it would be idiotic to give up advantages of your own mailer because it would not be able to parse mails that you don&#x27;t even receive.<p>Other than that, your thinking seems to be pretty one-dimensional. Email clients have more qualities than their ability to parse emails with lines longer than 78 characters (obviously, this is not really about them being unable to parse those lines, as in crashing or not displaying the mail at all, but about suboptimal handling), and some of those qualities might outweigh any disadvantage due to that. Also, it might just be that 78 character plain text mails are actually inherently superior to all the alternatives, in which case, even if the majority of emails today does not fit into that category, the sensible solution still would be to improve MUAs that send other formats rather than to make the older MUA support the inferior formats that are being widely used.<p>> The presence of specific mailing list client guidelines indicate that most email is not formatted to 78 character displays, a notion which you were challenging earlier.<p>Maybe you want to read the LKML&#x27;s actual FAQ? Those &quot;client guidelines&quot; have very little to do with a 78 character limit, and all with how one can efficiently communicate using email, how some of the more well-known bugs in various MUAs hinder that, and how one can work around those problems. Some of that is specific to software development, but most of it really isn&#x27;t at all. It just so happens that many newer MUAs tend to not support efficient work flows that have stood the test of time very well, and don&#x27;t really offer any sensible alternatives either, and also tend to lack in interoperability with those (mostly older) MUAs that do support those well-working workflows.",1404742997

7998923,comment,7996950,7998647,5,0,eli_gottlieb,,,"OH BOY I GET TO WRITE A RANT ON EPISTEMOLOGY OF SCIENCE AND INTERPRETATIONS OF STATISTICS!  <i>Eh-hem...</i><p>Anyway, Popper believed that you could never really give affirmative support to a hypothesis, only fail to falsify it.  A good example of why he believed this is that, after all, Newtonian gravitational mechanics passed hundreds of experimental tests for centuries at a time, but was still not actually <i>as true</i> as Einstein&#x27;s later Theory of General Relativity.  Popper also held that the actual process of coming up with theories required a Real Human Thinker somewhere in the mix, and that the experimental procedure of forming hypotheses, testing them, and converging to truth required the magic secret sauce of Real Human Thought.<p>This combined very well with Fisher and Neyman-Pearson statistical testing, under which one infers, &quot;the conditional probability (likelihood) of my evidence given absolute belief in my null hypothesis is very small&quot;, and thus treats the null hypothesis as falsified in Popperian fashion.  Of course, in actual statistical testing, the critical values of the test statistic will take a <i>particular</i> alternate hypothesis (parameter value or distribution) into account, and thus a very low likelihood of the evidence, given the null hypothesis, is <i>taken</i> (note the italics: this isn&#x27;t <i>really</i> a valid probabilistic inference) as support for the built-in alternative hypothesis.<p>This is, of course, complete bunk: we&#x27;ve done no <i>quantitative</i> reasoning whatsoever about the <i>hypotheses</i> themselves, null <i>or</i> alternative.  Which leaves us with exactly the same problem in frequentist statistics as in Popperian philosophy of science: there&#x27;s a big box marked &quot;And then the magic of scientific thought happens, in the magical mind of an actual scientist!&quot;  Well, we might ask, if the philosophy of science is supposed to guide scientists as a genuine epistemological tool, <i>what does Popper advise that the scientist should think and believe?</i>  And the answer is: conjecture things and test them, <i>hoping</i> that intuition and logic will guide the scientist to conjecture things which later turn out easy to test but difficult to falsify, this being taken as approximating eventual truth.<p>This gets rid of a problem that only exists in the academic study of epistemology: the Problem of Induction.  But look what a price we&#x27;ve paid to sidestep it!<p>Scientific epistemology as Bayesian inference, on the other hand, has considerably fewer such problems.  The two jobs remaining for the scientist are to invent coherent, testable hypotheses and to assign priors to them.  Testability is given a rigorous meaning: a hypothesis is testable when it generates a non-uniform likelihood distribution over evidence.  Priors are grounded in subjectivity, which sounds dirty but only <i>really</i> matters at small sample sizes (where frequentist inference would be weak <i>anyway</i>).  Inductive inference is then given a rigorous meaning: model the set of hypotheses as a set of mutually exclusive propositions yielding nonuniform likelihoods over the evidence, collect data, and then use Bayes&#x27; Rule to move information from your (assumed) belief in the data to your (malleable) belief in the various hypotheses.  This <i>is</i> rigorous probabilistic inference, since Bayes&#x27; Theorem is derivable directly from the definitions of conditional and joint probability.<p>(Philosophically speaking, this is also how you can escape the trap of trusting only in <i>a priori</i> reasoning: Bayes&#x27; Theorem and Cox&#x27;s Theorem give a solid <i>a priori</i> argument that you will always &quot;lose at life&quot; if you <i>don&#x27;t</i> reason using evidence and probability theory, compared to someone who does, <i>therefore you really, actually should and we&#x27;re not just making this up.</i>)<p>And then we can do what /u/murbard2 is alluding to, and go for &quot;hardcore mode&quot; on Bayesianism: Objective Informative Bayesianism (better referred to as Algorithmic Bayesianism).  This is the circumstance in which we explicitly treat statistical inference as a way of moving information from belief in data to belief in hypotheses (Bayesian) or from belief in hypotheses to belief in data (frequentist), treat models/hypotheses as computational objects, and treat probabilities as measuring belief in terms of <i>information</i> (usually measured in &quot;decibels&quot; if you&#x27;re being casual or &quot;bits&quot; if you&#x27;re a Real Information Theorist).  Or, in fact, this approach lets us dissolve the very notion of belief: information/evidence becomes something that <i>weighs upon</i> a hypothesis space to locate the truth, like how mass weighs upon space-time to create gravity.  You can thus view the real physical system under examination as emitting information when an experiment takes place, with some anti-information (randomness) mucking it up slightly.  Your inductive process starts with a hypothesis space &quot;weighed up&quot; or &quot;evened out&quot; with anti-information (ignorance) which then comes to reflect the real world as more and more space is &quot;weighed down&quot; by evidence-information the world emitted.  The primary problem, then, is how to assign priors: how to decide <i>how much</i> information must &quot;weigh down&quot; a particular hypothesis before it becomes &quot;heavy&quot; (believable with confidence).<p>Notably, when we phrase it this way, probabilistic phrasings of Occam&#x27;s Razor become intuitive to the point of obviousness: a simpler theory will have a higher prior, meaning we need less information to make us confident in it.  Thus, given a set of theories which all explain exactly the same data exactly as well (generate the same likelihoods for that data), and an assignment of priors such that simpler theories have greater priors, the theory about which we are most informed by the evidence, and in which we can be most confident, must therefore be the simplest.<p>(Of course, you could assign perverse priors that order your theories from the most complex to the simplest (in descending order of belief), but this just means you will require more evidence to arrive to the same answers.)<p>Algorithmic information theory then gives ways to formalize Occam&#x27;s Razor by assigning prior probabilities to all possible Turing Machines based on their algorithmic complexity.  This isn&#x27;t very useful in real life, but <i>does</i> actually <i>solve</i> the Problem of Induction and give a provably optimal way to generate predictive probabilities for anything computable at all (ie: just about anything).",1404742633

What tjradcliife is trying to do, by differentiating between plausibilities and probabilities is to address the concern of frequentism with Bayesianism: namely, the &quot;P(h)&quot;-- what is usually termed as a &quot;prior probability&quot; in statistical jargon-- usually does not arise from objective data.<p>Accordingly, Bayesianism can be treated with suspicion-- since the P(h) is arbitrarily specified, one could &quot;load the dice&quot; and obtain a P(h|e) (&quot;posterior probability&quot;) guaranteed to suit the analyst&#x27;s conclusions.<p>By differentiating the two creatures, tjradcliffe hopes to resolve the dis-ease with calling P(h|e) a &quot;probability&quot;. By frequentist philosophy, probabilities should be grounded in some sort of firm soil, e.g., the relative frequency of what would be observed if one could conduct an experiment ad infinitum. A Bayesian &quot;probability&quot;  is not grounded this way, so calling it a &quot;plausibility&quot; instead would resolve this tension.<p>Another way of putting this-- P(h) to a frequentist feels like a tainted probability-- really not a probability at all-- so even after updating the prior probability with data [i.e., P(e|h)/P(e)], the posterior probability P(h|e) still retains the influence of that original taint. Solution: stop calling the Bayesian probabilities &quot;probabilities&quot;; instead, call them &quot;plausibilities&quot;.",1404742585

7998850,comment,7993482,7994585,2,0,beat,,,"Back in the day, I used to build Class A directly heated triode tube amps for hi-fi. These are poo-poo&#x27;d by the self-styled &quot;scientific&quot; hi-fi community for their high THD specs. But it&#x27;s important to think about not only how much distortion is happening, but where the distortion is happening. In super-simple triode tube circuits with no negative feedback loops, THD is pretty much linear to the volume. For small signals - the detail in the mids and highs - distortion is effectively unmeasurable.<p>The mainstream A/B transistors + heavy negative feedback architecture has the benefit of low manufacturing cost (no need to match devices when you just feedback the differences out) and good specs. But where does the distortion happen? At the Class A/B crossover point, somewhere in the first watt. Until the amp hits maximum power and clips, the WORST distortion is in the first watt, where all the small signals live.<p>To my common sense and my ears, this explains how good-spec amps can sound very harsh and cold, while bad-spec amps can sound sweet and warm. It&#x27;s not &quot;euphonic distortion&quot;, as the pseudo-scientists claim. Rather, it&#x27;s that the warm amp is actually distorting <i>less</i> where it actually matters.",1404741999
