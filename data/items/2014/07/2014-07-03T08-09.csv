What makes software so different?<p>You don&#x27;t ask an electrical engineer to layout a complicated PCB on a whiteboard, you don&#x27;t have a civil engineer build a bridge out of popsicle sticks.<p>Surely hiring an incompetent electrical engineer is just as bad as hiring an incompetent software engineer, but from talking to the EEs I know, they just get asked basic questions or go over past projects--nothing nearly as stressful as a coding interview.<p>If other industries can get by without them, whiteboard technical interviews must not be as necessary as they&#x27;re made out to be.

7982120,comment,7979921,7980574,1,0,snogglethorpe,,,"Almost every Emacs user uses the standard keybindings for most stuff (though many change the odd binding or two for personal reasons).  They work <i>really</i> well once you get used to them, and they tend to form a system: C-f goes forward a character, M-f goes forward a word, C-M-f goes forward an &quot;expression&quot;, and those same modifier keys have similar relationships for other commands.<p>As for ergonomics... Emacs bindings feel far more natural and comfortable than any other editor bindings I&#x27;ve ever used, but then I&#x27;ve used Emacs for a long time and am well used to them.  I suspect that the same is true for most people: what feels/works best will have more to with what you&#x27;re used to than any inherent superiority.  [And probably no keyboard-oriented editor that&#x27;s been successful for any length of time will have a truly un-ergonomic design, because it couldn&#x27;t have succeeded with such.]<p>Probably the closest thing to what you&#x27;re describing is the various editor emulation packages, which often remap many basic bindings...  Of these, vi/vim emulation is probably the most popular these days, and there are like 4-5 vi/vim emulation packages, of varying degrees of sophistication (and age), although I&#x27;m not sure which is the current favorite (maybe &quot;evil&quot;? <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil</a> ).",1404377697

Would you mind explaining the terminology, or even better, expand on your thoughts in a blog post or something?<p>Bitcoin exchanges are generally very illiquid, in the meaning that little funds are kept on the exchanges. (Because there are no regulations and guarantees.) Would you not expect &quot;huge holes&quot; in such an order book? Why not?<p>What does &quot;price level&quot; mean? I read it as the distance between orders in the order book, but then your comment does not make sense. You are surprised these levels are farther apart than the bid/ask spread. Why?<p>What does &quot;unsophisticated&quot; mean? It seems to me you mean this in a specific sense rather than the dictionary meaning of the word. How is it that no discernible pattern is indicative of a less sophisticated market? In the layman definition of the word, one would expect the opposite.<p>I don&#x27;t know if other markets behave the same but Bitcoin exchanges have large dark components to them. If the price moves dramatically, lots of coins move in/out of the exchanges. Some people believe the days-destroyed metric is indicative of these movements, but in practice things are of course not that simple.<p>As you might understand, I do dabble with Bitcoin trading on the side on a pure hobbyist basis and I would be very interested in your views on this. I don&#x27;t know if there is a personal message function on the HN board but any answer would be appreciated. I think a lot of traders on Bitstamp and other exchanges are hobbyists too, but I have the feeling that something happened during the runup to the October rally and would not be surprised if there are quite a few pros among us now.",1404377447
