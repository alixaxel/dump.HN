I recently began interviewing for the first time with a number of companies (I&#x27;m about to graduate). I noticed that over the course of a month and 3 interviews with 3 separate companies my interviewing skills had increased hugely.<p>The 4th company I interviewed at had a very different perception of me than the 1st because of the month&#x27;s practice, even though I had essentially the same technical skills. Coding interviews test &quot;coding interview ability&quot; rather than &quot;coding ability&quot;, unfortunately the other ways (Github, aptitude tests etc..) have their own problems.",1404334779

I recently had a remote code problem where I was given a Visual Studio IDE (albeit minus Resharper) and absolutely killed it.<p>If I&#x27;m going to be challenged to write code in front of you, give me the tools I use every day, let me use the resources I use to solve problems efficiently (which btw can include StackOverflow) and you will get a much better picture of me.  I don&#x27;t write perfect code the moment it&#x27;s written.  Often I will mentally acknowledge something needs further thought and my brain will revisit it, sometimes days later, sometimes after multiple iterations.  I&#x27;m fastidious about those types of things, and as a result I can realistically say I write some of the best and least buggy code in my company.  I&#x27;m also very good at theorizing about problems and debugging, which is never looked at in an interview.<p>I guarantee you should hire me, but how can I show you that, and how can you gain confidence in that?",1404334677

As a super PAC, the outfit isn&#x27;t allowed to give directly to campaigns. But it can spend unlimited amounts to promote one candidate over another, or to defend a candidate from attacks. There are even more choices Mayday PAC will have to make. For advertising alone, you can choose from radio ads, TV ads and online ads. You can take out ads on broadcast TV, satellite TV or cable. You can pick the time of day.

7979662,comment,7978599,7979473,4,0,mbell,,,"I think inevitably we all look at languages from the angle of our own experience. For me, thinking of Go as any sort of replacement for C/C++ comes down to the fact that I&#x27;ve used those languages almost exclusively at a very low level. For me, that is firmware on micro-controllers, and not at the level of linux applications or arduino applications, but direct to the &#x27;bare metal&#x27; applications where direct memory addressing and other constructs that are &#x27;poor practice&#x27; in high level development are the norm. For example I&#x27;ve implemented an http server on an 8-bit microcontrollers with ~3KB of RAM. I can&#x27;t imagine doing anything remotely close to that type of work in Go, it&#x27;s on the wrong planet. Rust on the other hand does seem to have the capabilities required to do that type work so in the end, I don&#x27;t see them competing in any grand sense, they are different languages for different purposes.<p>Put in other words, there is a class of problems C/C++ are used for which Go isn&#x27;t even remotely suitable for, on the other hand, there is a large class of problems that C++ was used for, that could have been written in Java and Go is a good replacement for. I feel that the subset of problems that were/are solved in C/C++ that could not have been solved in something like Java is fairly small. Off the top of my head things like high end video games, high frequency trading, perhaps database type systems where direct memory access may not really be needed yet the performance constraints are tight enough that something like Java was too slow for it. This may be where the &#x27;systems programming language&#x27; moniker came from. I would guess that Google has a disproportionately large set of problems that fit into the space that I think is relatively rare for the programming community at large.",1404334317

The technical interview consisted of nothing, and I mean NOTHING but super advanced SQL questions.  (over the phone, I had specifically stated I hadn&#x27;t used SQL in years) My expectation was that I&#x27;d be interviewed using Python and asked to perform ML related tasks.<p>When I mentioned that I thought that the purpose of me being brought there was to add an ML dimension to the team, which was far too data analysis (using SQL and some R)focused and with no Python expertise, I was given a blank stare.<p>Then it hit me:  the guys interviewing me didn&#x27;t know how to do any of the stuff I had been brought down (by higher ups who weren&#x27;t in the room) to do, so they weren&#x27;t evaluating me on it.  They evaluated me on what THEY knew.  It&#x27;s the equivalent of Peyton Manning being asked to evaluate a linebacker, and demanding that the linebacker throw passes downfield.<p>The highlight was when one of the guys (typical pony-tail neck-beard type) pointed out that an alluvial flow diagram in my portfolio of data visualization projects wasn&#x27;t &quot;Tufte-esque&quot;.  (It was a gross misinterpretation of Edward Tufte&#x27;s commandments on his part, but am I really going to get in an argument with the guy interviewing me?)<p>It was clear that the guys in the room wanted someone who knew what they did and thought like they did.

It seems much easier to have an individual change his or her identity than to have the whole of society collectively agree to not associate a name with some act. You might still need some law to prohibit linking old identities with new ones, but this is vastly more workable than asking third parties to decide if something is &quot;inadequate or irrelevant&quot;. It&#x27;s also less likely to be abused -- e.g. a politician can&#x27;t censor a prior criminal act while simultaneously getting the benefits of name recognition.<p>Moreover, since a name change typically requires some sort of administrative petition, it provides an opportunity for judicial oversight.

Neither is Ruby, Python, Haskell, Perl, <insert trendy scripting/functional language here>.<p>I understand that you&#x27;re trying to push for teaching a language that might have more modern, real world applications, but CS is not ( at least in the undergraduate world ) about learning the modern or bleeding edge.

But, whatever the cause, I don&#x27;t feel that identifying myself as a feminists as closely associates me with objectionable activities at the fringes. More to the point, I simply don&#x27;t think most feminists generally are as virulently anti-man as MRAs are anti-woman. Again, maybe this is attributable to the size of the movement.

The syntax could look like this:<p>* #[1, 2, 3] <- persistent vector<p>* #{x: 1, y: 2} <- persistent map<p>An AST pipeline makes the &quot;analyze&quot; phase extensible, but it doesn&#x27;t do anything to the parser.

It&#x27;s also way easier to transform code because it has a pattern matching language and you don&#x27;t have to manually wrangle AST nodes.<p>Lastly, sweet.js keeps track of scoping, and in the future it will have modules, so you will be able to do something like:<p>```\nimport JSX from &quot;jsx-reader&quot;;<p>import # from &quot;mori&quot;;<p>// code ...\n```<p>And those language extensions are only available inside the module.

7979552,comment,7977796,7978684,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> As long as it is possible for domain owners to transfer ownership, it is possible to have your domain stolen if you have a security lapse that allows someone to impersonate you. If there is no mechanism to force a transfer back, then victims of that kind of domain theft will have no recourse other than to convince the thief to give it back.<p>This is the kind of situation where you need something that will make your life hard only in proportion to the amount that you screwed up. See if you can find anything seriously wrong with the following.<p>Let&#x27;s add a DNS record called change key. This record goes wherever there is a delegation to another nameserver. The change key signs the delegation without any timestamp and clients and resolvers cache the change key for a year. Every time the name is successfully resolved, the client resolves the change key again and resets the cache period back to a full year. The change key&#x27;s corresponding private key doesn&#x27;t go on any servers, it goes in a fire safe. If your servers get compromised you get out the change key, sign a revocation of the old delegation, sign the new one, and put it back in the fire safe. If you want to replace the change key (e.g. because the key length is now considered short) then you can sign the new one with the old one and present that signature to clients for a year. If you lose the change key then you can put a new one in the parent domain but no one will trust it for a year, in the meantime you can keep using the certificates signed by the old key, but for the next year you can&#x27;t change the delegation and DNS resolvers will be writing errors to their logs telling the admins to investigate. If the change key is compromised then you&#x27;re screwed for a year, but that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s offline in a locked container.<p>The result should be that you can&#x27;t forge a delegation without anyone noticing. You can take the domain offline by just refusing to serve any records for it, you can reassign it after taking it offline for a year, you can&#x27;t immediately point it somewhere else. That seems like a pretty good compromise.",1404333150

High level languages that still keep an eye on what can be implemented efficiently.<p>But I wonder; if these newer &#x27;systems&#x27; (which we can define to be very performant, though not necessarily C-level performant) languages are so interesting, why don&#x27;t any of the older systems languages come up?

Are these languages viable today, if you already can afford to use relatively new languages with all that that entails of lacking libraries etc.? Or are they dead ends? It seems weird to me that when talking about these languages, there seems to just be C/++ and these newer languages, while the older performant languages seem to not come up.

7979501,comment,7977062,7979117,2,0,innguest,,,"Ok so here&#x27;s one way to solve that problem in FP:<p>We define what we have first (after all this is mathematics):<p>EmailList = a list of Email<p>Email = a string that goes &quot;something&quot; then &quot;@&quot; then &quot;domain&quot;<p>Now what we want:<p>DomainList, no duplicates.<p>Ok so no we&#x27;re set up.\nWe want a function that takes us from an EmailList to DomainList, as defined above.\nThere are no objects so we simply say the relationships between things. I will introduce the tools we need:<p>map = takes a function and a list and applies that function to every element of the list, returning a new list.<p>We use map over EmailList with the function extractDomain which we will write later (it&#x27;s trivial to do without mutation so I won&#x27;t show here).<p>So now we have a list of domains, but there might be duplicates.<p>So now I have DomainList(with duplicates) and I want DomainList(without duplicates), so I want a function from DomainList to DomainList.<p>Well, what&#x27;s the difference between what I have and what I want? What I have has too much, and I want less (ie. the list I have has too many domains (duplicates) and I want fewer (unique)).<p>filter = takes a list and a function. That function it takes, that you will supply to filter, we&#x27;ll call f. Function f takes one list element (so filter will call f for every element) and it must return a boolean to mean whether that element should go into the new list, or if it should not go into the list.<p>So we could use filter to go from a DomainList with too much, to a DomainList with fewer things. However each time our function f is called, we don&#x27;t know if this function has already been called before with that same domain; and because we don&#x27;t have state to change a variable to keep a tally, it seems impossible.<p>So let&#x27;s approach the problem in a different way. One thing we could do is sort the list, then group adjacent similar items, then map over the list taking the first element of each item. But we won&#x27;t do that.<p>We need something more generic than filter. Let&#x27;s look at fold.<p>fold = takes a list, a function f, and a starting point z (that we call &#x27;zero&#x27;).\nFor each element of the list, it calls your supplied function f with the current element and the zero; but then, it would be useless because it would be the same zero all the time. So what fold does, to be useful, is that whatever the result of calling your function f with a list item and the zero is, THAT value (so the value the call to yourFunctionF(list_item, zero) returns) will be the next &#x27;zero&#x27;. So now we have a little machine called fold that can thread something we have through its inner mechanism and play along with us.<p>Using that we can say the zero is the list of elements we&#x27;ve seen so far.<p>So now our DomainList -> DomainList function will be a fold. That fold will take a the DomainList we have, and a zero that will be the empty list (to start with!) and a function f. That function f will simply check if the item is inside zero. If it is, then simply return zero (because that will be the zero for the next call to f!); if it&#x27;s not, then return a new zero with that item added to it.<p>Now we&#x27;ve achieved the goal without any mutation (ie. without us talking/concerning ourselves with any mutation. of course there&#x27;s lots of mutation going on in RAM but the point is not to eliminate that!)<p>Does that help?",1404332667

I used to use an Apple Extended Keyboard II at home, and a Das Keyboard at work, and I thought I was in heaven.<p>But one day I had to do some maintenance on some random computer in a closet at work, and the only spare keyboard we had sitting around was one of the old Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000&#x27;s, and using the split-wave layout was a revelation.

To see why, just look at Lisp and Haskell.  Users of both languages are sure that they&#x27;re at the top of the power curve.  They&#x27;re sure that when they look at the other language, they&#x27;re looking down, and they can tell you precisely why (&quot;it doesn&#x27;t even have macros&quot; and &quot;it doesn&#x27;t even have a decent type system&quot;, respectively).  But they can&#x27;t both be looking down at each other - unless languages cannot actually all be ordered along a single axis called &quot;power&quot;.<p>In fact, you have to ask &quot;power for what&quot;?

I wonder how many people are actually looking at the &quot;new&quot; page vs. the front page, as I would imagine that an incredibly small number of people are the ones that end up being responsible for whether an article falls through the cracks or not. Personally, I rarely look at articles on the new page, so I expect that there are quite a lot of articles that do fall through the cracks for me.<p>Appreciate the input on the article in particular - I thought it was an insightful look as a Seattle local who has been puzzled by the $15 wage minimum for quite some time. I definitely see the point of it being more off-topic, but I&#x27;d argue that the author&#x27;s background helps that cause (I have seen plenty of articles about random tech luminaries&#x27; opinions on somewhat off-topic items).<p>Regardless, thank you again for writing a reasoned reply to add context.",1404331453

Having an eshell open running my unit tests every time I save is a lot faster, though. Unfortunately, most of what I do is remote over SSH instead of having a local development environment. And that doesn&#x27;t even begin to cover building a jenkins (or other CI) script to run your non-compile-time unit tests.<p>> Or even to use CommonJS for that matter.<p>Which client side loaders would you recommend? I&#x27;ve used AMD/RequireJS in the past and its headaches were not worth the benefits. The only other project in the running is Webpack.<p>> but you can also use them without a watch task<p>I suppose I don&#x27;t understand the watch task hate. It&#x27;s there. It runs. It versions my build. It lets me know when I&#x27;ve saved something stupid. It&#x27;s faster than tabbing to a browser and going through the steps to reproduce the iota of code I just wrote, or refreshing a testrunner page.<p>How do you do continuous integration and save-time unit tests without a preprocessing step without tying your project to a bloated IDE?<p>> ES6 modules are just going to make it all easier.<p>When ES6 modules come around to being available in IE9 (or IE9 finally dies), I&#x27;ll believe that you can do all this without a processing step. Even when ES6 modules become available in modern browsers, you&#x27;ll still have to run everything through a preprocessing build step to get backwards compatibility. And woe to whomever tries to do dynamic dependency loading on mobile... that 200-2000ms per-http-request overhead on 3G will bite you right in the bounce rate.",1404331441
