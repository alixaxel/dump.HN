8007974,comment,8007589,8007589,4,0,tomcam,,,"I grew up in a place I don&#x27;t want to return to. Also, I have two handicapped kids, one of whom will need round-the-clock care long after I&#x27;m dead. I got sick (at 21) of crappy bosses. And finally, I chose a good field to work in (programming)<p>I became highly self-motivated at 21 because I was a dropout & knew I had to be better than my degreed peers to get an equally good job. It was either go to college, then get some crappy job as a teacher, or find an area of programming so challenging that it scared other programmers (back then, it was embedded systems and compiler implementation).<p>Ever since I decided at 21 to become a programmer (despite having absolutely no tech background) I have studied for my next job while I&#x27;m working the current one. At 34 Microsoft hired me with no resume despite the fact that I was old and the last thing I graduated from was middle school.<p>One thing I always keep in mind is this: are there people dumber than I am doing better than I am in whatever I happen to be doing at the moment? If the answer is yes, then I know I can be just as successful simply by working as hard as I need to until I&#x27;m as good as they are, or maybe a little better.<p>Have been CEO of my own company for 14 years now, but continue to study current programming practices and to do interesting projects with them. No matter what job I have had, no matter how good, I have always operated under the assumption I could lose it all tomorrow, and that I would be facing stiff competition for jobs.<p>I avoided Silicon Valley because it was too much of a pressure cooker. Instead I lived in more laid back areas that still had some tech presence. This let me live a moderately balanced life despite essentially working 2 jobs at all times. Had I gone to Silicon Valley I knew, even in the late 80s, I would be slave to an 80 hour-per-week job and end up, in all likelihood, with nothing to show for it.<p>I read the industry and business press carefully from afar & kept a close eye on what was doing well and where the market was underserved. I tried to match my skills to holes in the market. My approach can be scary because I have to take on more risk, but the rewards have been better.<p>Because of this I invested lots in Microsoft stock in the late 90s when everyone said they were dead. Their past, and their P/Ls, said something very different. The stock I owned went up 1300% during this time because everyone else, including Microsofties, was trying to get out if it. (I exited at the peak.) This money helped me invest in the business I own now. It was also a risky buy at the bottom of a market.<p>I have more than one paid-for house and no debt but I still keep up my skills.<p>Though my income is very good, even in my 50s I am ready to work as a developer or architect if my company shuts down tomorrow.",1404877889

8007960,comment,8007239,8007888,2,0,noname123,,,"> I went to Amherst (#1 liberal arts college in the country when I matriculated). A number of my classmates are almost a decade older than you and would love to be making 6 figures.<p>I bet a some of them are in or finishing up graduate school, pursuing a subject that they&#x27;re interested in though. Plenty of smart and well-adjusted people I know from undergrad make less than me, but for some of them - tbh, I&#x27;d switch places with them in a heartbeat for personal, job security and job satisfaction reasons.<p>I used to laugh secretly at my liberal arts peeps at Wesleyan (a worse liberal arts college) when we just graduated 6 years ago. But now peeps are pushing out their films in film festival, post-doc research at conferences and published novel tours and still relatively poor; but I&#x27;m quite envious of people taking creative control of their destiny and shipping something, which IMHO more important than the dollar figure. But ironically, it took me making six figures the confidence of reaching a certain &quot;threshold&quot; and the disillusionment of that &quot;threshold&quot; to realize this.<p>> a couple Googlers who got in straight out of school. They&#x27;re a minority<p>Yes. I bet most of them are graduates of top US engineering schools whom arguably have had a very sheltered experience (but probably still less sheltered than Amherst or Wes tho). They for sure got a head start compared to everyone else in &quot;personal finance.&quot; But tbh, like you say, dealing with personal difficulties is actually a blessing in disguise and an important phase in your life to know to keep going and going esp. when the going is tough. In some ways, I think the jury is still out for your Googler youn&#x27;g vs. the battered Amherst post-grad&#x27;s toughing it out.

8007956,comment,8007383,8007383,14,0,rubiquity,,,"If you&#x27;re out shopping for a new language to learn, I would recommend giving Elixir as much (or more :)) weight as you might give Go, Rust or Clojure.<p>Here&#x27;s a few things that I really like about Elixir:<p>- There&#x27;s a ton of great resources already out for learning Elixir. José&#x27;s article here is a good intro but Elixir&#x27;s official website has a very in-depth getting started guide[0]. Dave Thomas, the author of Pragmatic Programmer and Programming Ruby (arguably the book that helped Ruby grow pre-Rails), has written a great book titled &quot;Programming Elixir&quot;[1]. Authors at Manning and O&#x27;Reilly are also working on Elixir books to the best of my knowledge.<p>- Elixir ships with a great build tool, task runner and dependency manager named Mix. There is also a package manager already built named Hex[2].<p>- Elixir compiles directly to Erlang byte code, so you get to not only take advantage of a very mature virtual machine, but you also get direct interoperability with Erlang libraries! This gives Elixir a robust ecosystem of tools and libraries to use right out of the gate so you can be productive.<p>- I try not to judge a language by its syntax anymore, but I realize that some do. If that&#x27;s your thing, Elixir has a Ruby-inspired syntax as well as great support for metaprogramming via macros.<p>- Elixir development is going very fast and the language is stabilizing more and more by the day. If you need the &quot;1.0 stamp of approval&quot;, that should only be weeks to a couple months away at most. The community feels very strong for a language this early in the game. The creator of the language, José Valim, is also very fair and considerate when discussing the language.<p>- The pipe operator lets you take all of your small functions and easily show the flow of how the operations are applied. This is one of the killer features of Elixir for sure and I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;ll feel like I&#x27;ve overused it.<p>- Testing is at the very forefront of Elixir. All projects generated using Mix (the build tool described above) come with a ready to go test runner. You can also embed tests in the documentation of your code and they too will be tested for correctness.<p>Now, to be fair, here&#x27;s a couple things to keep in mind when learning Elixir. These might seem like negatives or challenging at first, but they quickly become some of your favorite parts of Elixir:<p>- Elixir is a functional programming language, so that can be quite different as most of us on HN I feel come from OOP backgrounds. You have to stop thinking in classes, methods and state and start thinking about data structures, functions and immutability. Elixir is dynamic though, so picking it up isn&#x27;t quite as challenging as learning a functional language and type system at the same time.<p>- Pattern matching and recursion are going to be at the core of writing expressive systems. Thinking about problems recursively is mind-bending at first but will start to feel natural. Pattern matching will both make you never look at an equals sign the same way again and help you write very easy to understand function bodies.<p>- OTP and its well thought out patterns are going to be pervasive to your Elixir programs. If you&#x27;ve ever ran into an Erlang zealot, they probably were ranting and raving about how well Erlang scales and handles failure. OTP and the Erlang VM are the secret sauce. How this all gets accomplished will feel very foreign at first (thinking in Supervision trees and message passing) but stick with it.<p>0 - <a href=""http://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pragprog.com/book/elixir/programming-elixir</a><p>1 - <a href=""http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://hex.pm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hex.pm</a>",1404877400

8007950,comment,8006111,8007478,1,0,AaronFriel,,,"If I could still edit it, I would correct my post to say that a user that has not activated remote desktop does have to enable it manually.<p>But there is still <i>no way</i> to control Chrome&#x27;s surface area in the future, and features like this give me the heebie-jeebies. Two things:<p>1. Users that have already enable Chrome Remote Desktop don&#x27;t need to authorize the set of computers that can access it remotely. You authorize one endpoint, but not the other. And since Chrome will occasionally install new extensions and apps in its regular updates, there&#x27;s no notification for a lay user to know why they got &quot;Chrome Remote Desktop&quot;. For that matter, anyone with access to a Google account can leverage one Chrome sync feature to gain access to others (mainly: from an extensions into completely owning their machine), allowing them to leverage Google account access into a much greater vulnerability on remote physical machines. Passwords, open tabs, history, form data, credit card information.<p>Let me walk you through this. Alice is using her computer at work. Eve has obtained Alice&#x27;s credentials, and sets up a Chrome account on a machine and enables full sync, and installs the Chrome Remote Desktop extension on her computer.<p>Alice sees a new extension appear on her computer. Why is it there? Alice is never informed, and Google adds new apps and extensions with updates occasionally, so Alice proceeds to install Chrome Remote Desktop. Why not? Chrome seemed to think it was safe to put on her front page or in her app bar. Eve can pin it to her bookmark bar with a title like &quot;Connect from home!&quot;, or even install multiple bookmarks to do this:<p>&quot;Connect from home&quot; &quot;now today&quot; &quot;with Google Chrome&quot; &quot;Remote Desktop!&quot;<p>Now it&#x27;s just a matter of time. Eve could also use her access to the account to synchronize new extensions silently and in the background, allowing them to siphon off passwords and credit card numbers, even if Alice disallowed those items from synchronizing. Extensions are simply <i>too powerful</i> and the automatic update feature makes every extension from a third party developer a ticking time bomb.<p>2. You don&#x27;t really offer a great way of blocking increases to the attack surface area of Chrome. You offer a way to totally turn off all <i>Google Chrome</i> automatic updates, but woe is the administrator that tries to use your policy tools to lock down Chrome. As Chrome is becoming an operating system unto itself, I find myself at a loss to understand why policies for this new operating system lag behind. Your suggestion doesn&#x27;t prevent Chrome from automatically updating or synchronizing new extensions, and doesn&#x27;t provide the average user with protection from a hijacked Chrome account. Disabling Chrome&#x27;s automatic updates, if anything, makes them <i>less secure</i>.<p>No, what I want is the ability to lock Chrome&#x27;s surface area to a particular version, not lock Chrome to the version itself. I want to see ways to limit my liability as an administrator to what I know and understand - and the Chrome team seems to think they know better than I do how to keep lay users safe. I disagree - given the fact that me, the security paranoid user, has already been bit by Chrome&#x27;s security policies, I have no hope that they will avoid the same fate.",1404877267

The biggest weakness for Go, in my experience, is that its facilities for templating, generation of HTML, and webapp development are pretty weak.  But if you go the single-page app system, then your server just needs to serve JSON, and Go&#x27;s JSON encoder is a pretty nice piece of software.<p>The big monkey wrench in this picture is Polymer, which has significantly more support within Google than Angular and has the advantage of aligning with the emerging web standards that will be baked into browsers.  Polymer is still HTML-based, which means that Go still doesn&#x27;t have great support for working with it.",1404876802
