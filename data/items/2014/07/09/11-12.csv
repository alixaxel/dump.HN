A function is essentially a proper chunk (whereas a comment is a bad way to do the same thing). Depending on the paradigm, I usually enjoy code that has tiny units, but many of those - i.e. a function with 100 lines is harder to read than 100 functions with one line each. Ideally each name adds proper meaning to the code so that the intent becomes clear. Code like this is usually easier to change, reuse and test (tdd).<p>This can go the wrong way - many people mentioned how too many abstraction layers in big java projects are a pain, and I agree, as they often make the code more meaningless and abstract, rather than concrete.

Wearing a seatbelt or a helmet is not going to help the other side involved in the accident.<p>First, nobody wants to see people dying. If you want to see the cold side of it, a lot of people fall in depressions due to traffic accidents, which in turn means productivity lowers. And remember: public healthcare must pay for the hospital, the medics, and if the accident makes you unable to work, you&#x27;ll get a life-time pension, which the country must pay for as well.<p>> Precisely what is going to happen.

This occurs in many diseases, which make them seem nearly incurable, like sepsis or cancer. For example, when TNF (tumor necrosis factor0 activates inappropriately on the periphery of a cell it, to dramatically simplify, leads to growth during inappropriate stages of your life (adulthood), and triggers a cascade of thousands of events. When one event is altered, the cascade goes through a different direction, to the same goal.

Make that problem easy to solve, and I can spare the 10 seconds it takes to understand a ternary operator. Hell, I can spare the 10 minutes it takes to understand some weird nested list comprehension.

The act of taking something by force; esp. the seizure of property by violent means; robbery, plundering. Also as a count noun: an instance of this, a robbery, a raid. Now rare (chiefly arch. and literary).<p>...<p>(first usage c. 1425)\n2. Originally and chiefly: the act or crime, committed by a man, of forcing a woman to have sexual intercourse with him against her will, esp. by means of threats or violence. In later use more generally: the act of forced, non-consenting, or illegal sexual intercourse with another person; sexual violation or assault.<p>Subnote:<p>The precise legal definition of rape has varied over time and between legal systems. Historically, rape was considered to be the act of a man forcing a woman other than his wife to have intercourse against her will, but recently the definition has broadened. Under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, in the United Kingdom the crime of rape includes the penile penetration of the vagina, anus, or mouth of another person of either sex, where consent to the act has not been given. This includes marital rape: in 1992 the House of Lords, in its judicial capacity, decided that the previous understanding (i.e. that a wife had given an irrevocable consent to intercourse) was no longer part of the law. Sexual penetration of a child under the age of 13 also constitutes rape irrespective of whether consent is obtained. In the United States the precise criminal definition of rape varies from state to state.</i><p>As time moves on, so do definitions and the laws that go with them.<p>One bit of the subnote that really sounds out for the sheer number of horrible bits in it: &quot;an act of a <i>man</i> forcing a <i>woman</i> other than <i>his wife</i>...&quot;<p>Thankfully we&#x27;ve progressed quite a bit from those dark days.",1404905770

The &quot;GNU&quot; vision shares thoughts with the unix philosophy of do something, do it well. One shouldn&#x27;t needlessly rewrite and re-create in the hopes that you&#x27;ll get lucky and pull a zuckerberg before the next crash. Instead, invest in well-done, simple technology. As you said, many talented individuals are already working to this end.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but the problem is not the talented individuals or their efforts. Its that fundamentally new and different ways of computing and approaching computing problems arise as technology continues to progress.<p>We can sit here and grouchily state that reimplementing UNIX is the problem, but even within the ebb and flow of Linux we see substantial change and reformation over the arc of 5 years. And that&#x27;s ignoring the actual GUI toolkits which have been in a constant state of flux and only partial levels of functionality.<p>These are challenges that the community has been happy to dismiss even as they create increasingly obvious and increasingly difficult barriers to entry in the community. They do so because they do not inherently feel the problem as acutely, they&#x27;re the beneficiaries of education and opportunity (or more succinctly, privilege) that they are happy to dismiss as something that anyone could have.

8009002,comment,8006997,8008100,7,0,sparkie,,,"I too dislike tutorials focused around the REPL, because it&#x27;s rarely how you write code in practice. The REPL is more of a debugging tool for quickly testing and manipulating code you&#x27;ve already written.<p>I&#x27;d jump directly into creating code files/modules - begin by creating simple programs using `main` as you would in other languages. Create a file with &quot;.hs&quot; extension, (Haskell filenames start with capital letters by convention, since they share the name of the module)<p><pre><code>    main :: IO ()\n    main = putStrLn &quot;Hello World!&quot;\n</code></pre>\nMake sure the GHC bianries are in your PATH, and use the program &quot;runhaskell File.hs&quot; to quickly compile and execute them. Also, from ghci you can use the command (:load File.hs), if you want to debug stuff.<p>The preferred tool for writing Haskell though is emacs. If you&#x27;re not familiar with emacs, its also a great opportunity to learn. Grab emacs 24, and open the file ~/.emacs, paste in this snippet:<p><pre><code>    (require &#x27;package)\n    (add-to-list &#x27;package-archives\n             &#x27;(&quot;marmalade&quot; . &quot;http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/&quot;))\n    (package-initialize)\n</code></pre>\nThen hit M-x (M for Meta, which is typically Alt), and type <i>eval-buffer</i> into the minibuffer at the bottom.\nIf no errors, hit M-x and type into the mini-buffer:<p><pre><code>    package-install haskell-mode\n</code></pre>\nYou can add the following to the .emacs file and use `eval-buffer` again. Also save with C-x C-s.<p><pre><code>    (add-hook &#x27;haskell-mode-hook &#x27;turn-on-haskell-indentation)\n    (add-hook &#x27;haskell-mode-hook &#x27;turn-on-haskell-doc-mode)\n</code></pre>\nNext step is to just open an empty haskell file. Create a new directory for your project with `M-x make-directory`, and create a new haskell file using C-x C-f. Add some code, and hit C-c C-l (load in ghci), and emacs will pop open a new window, launch ghci and load your code into it.<p>You can switch over to the ghci window with C-x o (cycle windows), and type some code into it for testing. (Note it can be quite buggy if the cursor is not in the right place - there needs to be a space after the prompt > ¦). Useful keyboard shortcuts to remember here are M-p (previous) and M-n to cycle through previously used commands. (You can rebind any keys to how you wish.)<p>You can also add typicall IDE features like &quot;run without debugging&quot; and such with simple snippets of elisp. Say if we want to bind F6 to this command, we can add this hack to .emacs, save and eval the expression.<p><pre><code>    (global-set-key [f6] \n        (lambda () \n            (interactive) \n            (async-shell-command (concat &quot;runhaskell &quot; buffer-file-name))))\n</code></pre>\nNow with an active haskell file, F6 will launch like an application, bypassing GHCI - and emacs will typically open a new window (or replace an existing one) with the stdout/stderror for the application.<p>That&#x27;ll get you started anyway. From there, using LYAH is a good beginner resource, although it won&#x27;t get you much further than past the syntax and semantics of the core language. It doesn&#x27;t cover the plethora of language extensions, building projects, using cabal, haddock, quickcheck and more. I&#x27;m not aware of a single resource which covers these though - I just learned what was needed as and when by searching - the best information typically comes from one-off blogs focused on a specific problem.",1404904082
