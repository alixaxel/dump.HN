Now we just use all these hipsterish technologies that we hope to magically solve our problems by just sticking one&#x27;s output into another&#x27;s input. If we think about what happens in a single machine while processing data we have had exactly the same problems for decades. How do you process 2 CDs worth of data when you only have a 486 with 4/8/16Mb of ram ?<p>- Historically, the data rarely (never) fitted into memory and was at least 100x larger than it.<p>- If we want to have it for the long run we need to store it on disk. Smarter, dumber, compact or verbose .. you have to do it.<p>- We have to make sure we spend the little CPU time we have on processing data not jiggling with it. Map-Reduce jobs takes ages to initialize and burn CPU just to read and write to file partitions.<p>- If you have a long processing pipeline there are two major concepts that we use: buffers and pumps. Files, cache, DBs act as buffers. Kafka is a essentially a pump with a buffer;<p>- When you process data, depending on what you compute, you need or need not multiple passes through the data. ML and AI most of the time needs such things. Descriptive stats with some smart math tricks avoids two passes. This variable number of passes is the party pooper in stream analytics. In cryptography they solved the problem by breaking down the stream into blocks of equal size. That makes sense for raw data because it is being assemble back using some buffers and pumps at some upper layers. Data wise, mathematically and statistically wise, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to randomly split data into chunks and apply your choice of algos.<p>- I still don&#x27;t understand why so many of us rely on out-of-the-box solutions instead trying to solve the problems, they have specifically, on their own. Why wouldn&#x27;t a developer stick his java code directly into the pipeline to suck data from Kafka and do his bespoke magic. It will be super fast because it is very specific and does exactly one single job. Yes, there will be maintenance time but all solutions require that time. Instead of debugging apache hadoop/spark/Tez code you debug your own.<p>What is mentioned above just scratches the surface of the knobs and tuning points of a processing pipeline. These are decisions we need to take and expecting fast-food solutions to do it for us are completely unrealistic expectations.",1404380664

For example, adding iron to breakfast cereals is <i>completely</i> ridiculous.<p>First of all, it&#x27;s added as pure iron. <i>You don&#x27;t absorb iron in its mineral form</i>, it needs to be in some organic form to be digested. So that already makes it totally pointless.<p>But let&#x27;s ignore that for a moment and pretend we could digest mineral iron.

7982164,comment,7981431,7981431,32,0,inoop,,,"Looks like pretty standard WSN tech. Some points of critique:<p>- Range: 50 square miles? That would imply a range of r=4 miles, which is pretty impressive. Is this single hop, or are they &#x27;cheating&#x27; by implying a multi-hop network? The best I&#x27;ve seen is >1km on an Australian deployment where the base station was on a hill and the nodes were deployed on a lake, and this was using an nrf905 on the 915 MHZ band with a whip antenna iirc.<p>- Power consumption: 0.026mA. Amps is a measure for current, not energy? I can send 10 bytes at near-zero average amps as long as I do it only once per millennium. This number is completely meaningless without a time scale. They should just report mJ if they want to talk about the energy consumed in a single operation.<p>- 765 days life time. Again, they are not reporting the full story here: what is the size of the battery? What type of battery? Is this estimated, or measured? These nodes typically use MSP430&#x27;s and may have a very, very low sleep current (e.g. ~8uA for a tmote). However, the numbers quoted by the manufacturer are often averages, and there may be significant differences between nodes (<a href=""http://www.cse.msu.edu/~glxing/docs/ipsn13-Nemo.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cse.msu.edu/~glxing/docs/ipsn13-Nemo.pdf</a>)<p>Two years is a very typical life-time for sensor nodes. However, you can only get that with very, very low data rates (e.g. one packet every minute). If you&#x27;re doing multi-hop, nodes close to the sink (bridge) will drain faster as they have to relay not only their own data, but that of nodes down the routing tree as well. So, you might end up with a situation where the life-time of the network is much lower than that of an individual node.<p>- Nitpicking, but one day is not typical at all for cellular. Sure, your phone only lasts a day on a charge, but that is mostly due to to the main SoC and display. If you look at the modem in isolation, most of the energy is spent in energy tails, which you could cut down considerably on a network that supports fast dormancy. If you don&#x27;t care too much about latency (i.e. you want your nodes to upload data only once per so-many hours or even days), you can easily go a week between battery swaps.",1404378832
