I think the impulse to do it will be there - it seems like a readily outsourced job, right? just committing boilerplate code, right?! - but the reality is that determining requirements and co-located work is crucial (this is backed up by decades of research which I can go dig up if someone wants). You can no sooner outsource the development team than you can management and everyone else interacting directly with those developers. And at that point it sounds like you&#x27;re just talking about a company in another country.<p>Reason 1 (about human culture etc...) should actually strike a cord with me since I studied Anthropology for my undergrad degree[0], but even <i>still</i> I disagree with this article&#x27;s premise. Don&#x27;t take &quot;you should be focusing on HCI and culture&quot; and conflate that with &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t study CS&quot;. This is a stronger case for the argument that social scientists should be taking CS courses (and vice versa) than it is for anything else.<p>In STEM fields I sometimes find people who condescendingly talk about social sciences and humanities students because their job prospects seem (and indeed are) grim. It&#x27;s rarer that someone in one of those fields derisively fires back with crap about how shallow a CS (or related) education is, but it happens as it has here. It&#x27;s not just unproductive; it&#x27;s toxic. People instinctively respond by digging deeper into the trenches and preparing defensive, even offensive responses in retaliation for what seem like attacks on their intellectual passions. These posts polarize us and discourage us from engaging with people from other fields for fear that we&#x27;re in for yet another flame war.<p>We should all be talking about how we can enrich our discourses with wisdom from other fields, not taking pot shots from our respective camps about how much better ours is than the other&#x27;s. There&#x27;s a lot that Computer Science can do for other fields, and a lot that other fields can do for CS.<p>0: to be fair, I double-majored, but I associate personally more closely with Anthropology at the moment (although for credibility&#x27;s sake, I&#x27;m studying CS now).",1404195967

Because of that, we got to the point where we did have to consult an attorney to get us back on track.<p>If you&#x27;re working with an OSS community, it&#x27;s important to note that giving stuff away != a charity.  You need to emphasize that you are working specifically for the underprivileged.  Even if you have an underprivileged community that you are serving, if you serve all comers it could easily seem as if it was self-serving to donors.<p>The educational exemption is generally much more appropriate for information and technology, like philipn said.  When we took the time to explain that our goal was to teach people about their own communities, they were much more receptive.  Other orgs like The Perl Foundation were similarly organized as educational (providing training at conferences, educational grants).  Likewise with Wikimedia Foundation, which is fairly obviously educational despite major software investments.<p>If what you want to do is just be tax-exempt -- but not have tax deductible donations -- that&#x27;s a much easier thing to do.  A 501(c)6 may serve any community, so long as it gets most of its funding from donations or membership dues.  That&#x27;s how the Linux Foundation handles it.

Unfortunately, this lane changing, especially in gridlock situations, slows other cars down more than their overall speed is increased.

Planting trees is something that city governments routinely do for the purposes of beautification or whatever. If a non-profit wants to do it, that&#x27;s a perfectly legitimate reason to get tax exempt status.

It is designed like the US to protect workers being exploited.  \nNote that it is not entirely designed to prevent tax avoidance - someone pays my National Insurance (think benefits) - either my &quot;employer&quot; or my own company.<p>Now I am a middle aged, middle class skilled software professional with 20 years experience. <i>Exploiting</i> me is qualitivly different to exploiting a single mother on a zero hours contract at the local factory.  And HMRC knows this - and has better things to do with their time.<p>This is not to say that my contracts are shams or that the basic principles of independence and substitution are not there - but that we are all big boys - exploiting 500/day software developers is like raping a hippo - difficult, noisy and leaves no-one satisfied.<p>I would focus on an aspect of the 20 questions like &quot;substitution&quot;.  Under IR35 the contracting company must have the right to swap out a person doing the job - that is if Mikado Software wants to send Bob in to do just as professional a job as me, then the contract jus allow this and the &quot;employer&quot; can&#x27;t refuse.  A friend and I used to promise to act as swap partners to make this happen (he is now following his startup dreams at Nujobs.co.uk)<p>This is I have found the simplest and best way to say to a client &quot;you are buying services from a company, not just me&quot;. It is something I do rarely obviously but with lead time and explanation everyone sees it as a tough but necessary thing to do - IR35 rules don&#x27;t you know !<p>Your ability to perform the agency role is as others say a sales function (these guys spend all day everyday cold calling - the bad ones do at least)<p>But your ability to substitute other developers in for yourself is the key - if you are doing well for a client and they have more work then you are in a great position to &quot;bring in this great developer I know&quot; to help - and suddenly you are not running a single person contractor anymore but a digital agency.  This is a lot of work and stress so think carefully - and as a rule of thumb you will need to hire out 8 employees to start making more take home than you do now.<p>So if you focus on something like substitution, and get the idea you are a company not a hire into the minds of your &quot;employer&quot;, and if you build up a marketing presence as a &quot;agency focused on xxx&quot; and if you want to run an Dev shop, then you <i>will</i> find a client who wants to hire a shop for a actual project not just bums on seats.<p>But I would warn you Brennan Dunn (bdunn on HN) is clear eyed on the costs and stress of running a profitable shop - and that only when you have grown to 8 or so people will you start to see an easier road than just being a bum on a seat.<p>In short, don&#x27;t worry about someone capturing the &quot;contractor surplus&quot; - 20% is about average and it&#x27;s dropping.  The guys who who raking in 50% were exploiting you - are you still workin there? See ?<p>Focus on upping your daily rate for a year whilst building an expertise and audience in a certain fun niche.  After this I suggest you may well be in a better position to decide how to jump.  If you aren&#x27;t on 100/hr find a contract where you are.  If you are on 100/hr move up to 120.  Keep doing this for six months - I was made redundant in 2008 and it took 8 months of hustling every lunchtime to move three contracts and hit 120k/pa (about 200USD).  It&#x27;s doable.",1404195130
