8062991,comment,8061592,8061887,1,0,Perseids,,,"> Software performance of SHA-3 is unfortunately not very good. The other finalists like BLAKE (or its faster successor BLAKE2), or Skein, are much more viable software contenders (and make excellent tree hashes), and no-one&#x27;s particularly rushing towards SHA-3 anyway as except for the length-extension attack common to all Damgård-Merkle hashes, the SHA-2 functions seem okay for now<p>The main reason for the choice of Keccak was not speed but diversity to the SHA2 family. Which is consistent with the motivation to start with the contest in the first place: It was feared that SHA2 would fall soon after the cryptanalytical advances against MD5 and SHA1 were published. As such Bruce Schneier, being one of the authors of Skein, did welcome the decision for Keccak:<p>> It&#x27;s a fine choice. I&#x27;m glad that SHA-3 is nothing like the SHA-2 family; something completely different is good. - <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/keccak_is_sha-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/10/keccak_is_sha...</a><p>A few days earlier he wished the outcome to be &quot;no award&quot; with pretty much the same argument you gave: <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/09/sha-3_will_be_a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/09/sha-3_will_be...</a><p>> I am not entirely satisfied with the SHAKE XOF functions, as they didn&#x27;t specify SHAKE512(M,d) = KECCAK[1024](M || 1111, d) but instead the weaker SHAKE256 and SHAKE128. Those functions won&#x27;t have a problem now, but I don&#x27;t think they hold up to post-quantum well enough for use with, say, Merkle signatures.<p>As I have written above ( <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8062952"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8062952</a> ) even a security of 256bit is astronomically high.

If not, .NET and associated languages are in the same position as Swift, surely?<p>Plenty of people write software for Windows using .NET, which happens to be the main fashionable system to use on Windows, and isn&#x27;t typically popular on Mac OSX. But this does not make .NET rubbish - it just happens to be designed for Windows and isn&#x27;t natively available on Mac OSX from Apple. Does this make .NET and associated languages &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;not worth learning&quot;?<p>Just because Mono is available on other platforms thanks to the huge effort from the community does not necessarily mean it would be a good choice to use for a cross-platform product, as the real journey and path of the platform is still in the hands of Microsoft. This is the same as Java used to be. But it didn&#x27;t stop people writing plenty of software in Java, thanks to the main platforms supported by the Java VM. Did this make Java &quot;not worth learning&quot;?<p>I suppose Apple doesn&#x27;t really need to care about making a language for other platforms. From the perspective of developers on Apple platforms, the need for a cross-platform language/system would seem redundant. As other posters have mentioned, the niche Objective-C language has found plenty of developers, and that&#x27;s typically available on Apple devices (unless you count GNUstep). Does this make Objective-C &quot;not worth learning&quot;?<p>And remember that just because Swift is on one platform doesn&#x27;t mean you CAN&#x27;T do cool things with it. It just means that you can only do them on one platform. That is in Apple&#x27;s best interests. Does it really need to be available on every platform to be usable?<p>For example, they don&#x27;t serve pizza at my local Chinese takeaway. This doesn&#x27;t stop the food there from being great. And it doesn&#x27;t make pizza less delicious when I buy it from elsewhere. But I&#x27;d be foolish to complain about the lack of pizza from the Chinese takeaway and refuse to eat the lovely Chinese food they serve there. Chinese food and pizza are both delicious, and they&#x27;re only available from different places, but that doesn&#x27;t diminish their taste.<p>I suppose the witty solution to the problem you face is to just learn C or C++ and do cross-platform stuff with that.",1405932846

Arguments often involve trusting that the proponent is not lying or misleading us, especially when there is a need for experts to interpret complicated data. You might have two initial hypotheses:<p><pre><code>  * H is false\n  * H is true\n</code></pre>\nWhen some actor A introduces new evidence in support of H, there are additional hypotheses that must be introduced:<p><pre><code>  * H is false, and A is lying\n  * H is true, and A is telling the truth\n  * H is true, and A is lying\n  * H is false, and A is telling the truth\n</code></pre>\nAny evidence that A introduces in support of H equally supports the first two new hypotheses, while any evidence that A introduces refuting H supports the last two. The result is that, depending on your priors on H and on A&#x27;s trustworthiness, A&#x27;s evidence might never be able to convince you that H is true. This means that logical fallacies such as the genetic fallacy are not applicable when there is expertise involved.<p>If we were all experts or had unlimited time and access to the same information as an argument&#x27;s proponents, then the genetic fallacy would be hugely useful. With real-world constraints on time and information, it&#x27;s almost always impossible to evaluate an argument separately from its proponent&#x27;s commitment to truth.<p>[1] <a href=""http://omega.albany.edu:8008/ETJ-PDF/cc5d.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://omega.albany.edu:8008/ETJ-PDF/cc5d.pdf</a>\n[2] Previous HN discussion: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7929203"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7929203</a>",1405931559

8062952,comment,8061592,8061855,5,0,Perseids,,,"> To avoid generic preimage attacks, the capacity parameter in Keccak must be 4 times the size of the desired security level<p>Even though I support your conclusion of it being a manufactured controversy, this part of your post is not correct - it&#x27;s actually 2 times - and is at the heart of the discussion. A citation from the Keccak site:<p>> The capacity is a parameter of the sponge construction (and of Keccak) that determines a particular security strength level, in the line of the levels defined in [NIST SP 800-57]. Namely, for a capacity c, the security strength level is c/2 bits and the sponge function is claimed to resist against all attacks up to 2^c/2, unless easier with a random oracle. - <a href=""http://keccak.noekeon.org/yes_this_is_keccak.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://keccak.noekeon.org/yes_this_is_keccak.html</a><p>NIST requested a preimage resistance of 512bit for the SHA512 replacement which was a standard assumption for hash function following the usual design patterns. These classical constructions try to guarantee a preimage resistance of n bit and collision resistance of n/2 bit for an output size of n bit. These are the theoretically possible maximum values. Anything above can be broken with generic attacks (this is what the citation refers to with &quot;unless easier with a random oracle&quot;).<p>And then came Keccak with its new design. This new design was exactly the reason why it was chosen as SHA3, to provide as much diversity as possible in case of larger cryptographic breakthroughs. Remember that MD5 and SHA1 simultaneously  suffered progressive attacks relying on the same newly discovered attack principles.<p>The new design of Keccak contains one security parameter for all attacks: The capacity c. If the output size is large enough to support the desired security then all security levels are c/2 bits. Additionally the speed of Keccak is directly proportionally to 1600-c. That means the speed for c=512 is roughly doubly the speed for c=1024. And as pointed out by others, the speed for c=1024 is rather lousy.<p>Now because of the requirements set forth by NIST in the original selection process the Keccak authors chose c=512 for the SHA256 replacement and c=1024 for the SHA512 replacement.<p>I fully agree with this part:<p>> So the proposal was to set c = 2n, where n is the security level. This puts the preimage resistance of Keccak at the same level as its collision resistance, i.e., 2^128 preimage security for a 256-bit output, and 2^256 security for a 512-bit hash. That is, the strengths of the 3 main properties of the hash function, preimage, second-preimage, and collision-resistance are all the same. This is not what is expected out of a perfect hash function, but this is very reasonable nonetheless, and the performance of Keccak is otherwise lacking.<p>The argument for why it is very reasonable is that the difference between a 256bit security level (i.e. c=512) and 512bit security level is theoretical at best. Remember that a 256bit security level means that there ought to be no attack using less than 2^256 many steps. Currently it is believed that 2^128 many steps is unachievable for human kind in the near future. Now 256bit security pushes the requirement to a number of steps that is physically impossible with the available energy in our solar system, whatever kind of fancy computing technology you invent. My favorite quote of Applied Cryptography (page 158): &quot;brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.&quot;<p>Now make this requirement 2^256 times harder and you end up with the absurdly high requirement of 512 bit security.<p>I find it somewhat reasonable to ask for 256 bit security to be on the safe side regarding future advancement in quantum computing and to allow for some leeway in case there are some cryptanalytical advances that might be spoiled with a higher capacity. But this extra margin of security is already fully covered with c=512. If you want increase the likely hood it resists against future cryptanalytical advances there are other nobs to turn. Specifically each iteration of Keccak - which takes in a chunk of input - is build out of several rounds where in each round a permutation is applied to the current state. Many cryptographic primitives have a similar designs, AES is build of several rounds as well as the SHA3 finalist Skein. A property of symmetric cryptography that seems somewhat magical from the outside  is that even though a single round is in no way secure if you take enough of these rounds the attacks start to fail. Often attacks are developed that can break k out of the n rounds, that means assuming it only had k rounds, we can break the primitive. A common rough measurement for the security margin of a cryptographic algorithm is how large the quotient k/n of breakable rounds vs actual rounds is.<p>So if one wants to increase the prophesied security against future attacks, then the best place to decrease the efficiency in is in the number of rounds.",1405931498
