The fact that our industry is deeply, irretrievably competitive is (imho) part of why it&#x27;s deeply, irretrievably gender-skewed.<p>(Caveats: you&#x27;re right that women perform in the industry just fine.  Also, many women are motivated and successful in competitive environments, and those women are negatively affected by perception that their gender prevents them from being competitive.)",1406332748

Russia would surely see the very proposal to include Ukraine as intensely threatening. It could be a giant bluff in a way - would we dare to include Ukraine, knowing how deeply it threatens Russia? Would Russia dare to do anything direct about it, like a preemptive invasion, maybe before they were a full member? If they did, would we respond, drawing ourselves into a large war, or ignore it, potentially diluting the meaning of NATO and tempting Russia to try invading other NATO members as well? Would Russia respond vigorously but indirectly, essentially starting a new Cold War?",1406332659

I don&#x27;t think anything but the GPL (and friends) gives that position.<p>You can also say to my position that it&#x27;s terribly unethical to ask people in each company that wants to do X to do the same project (but duplicated for each company), rather than having an open source project that has liberal licensing and having the engineers share work.

8088263,comment,8086549,8086549,1,0,yypark,,,"First off, I applaud YC&#x27;s efforts in this sphere to give all groups more opportunity to participate in startups and tech in general. I do not mean to disparage efforts or &quot;derail&quot; a conversation, but to bring up the fundamental question once the low-hanging fruit - discrimination, etc. is gone - self-selection and equality of result as a goal.<p>Any diversity discussion will eventually reach the awkward points of over-represented minorities and self-selection, which negatively impact numerical diversity: There are some elements of the industry that will inherently self-select for groups. Asian males are currently the most over-represented group - racially due to US immigration policy and cultural factors encouraging many recent immigrants to go into technical fields and not humanities.<p>Men tend to self-select into higher risk and highly competitive environments - e.g. startups, hackathons [1] but also ones with negative outcomes - crime, gambling addiction - see the 9-to-1 ratio of incarcerated men to women. (Denying the evidence for risk-taking and self-selection is to me, similar to denying evidence that sexism exists -- on the face of not wanting to confront it).<p>At what point do these become issues to address? It seems like the desired result is not the strawman, Harrison Bergeron, 100% representative (of what? the US? the world?) demographic, so what is the desired outcome? I&#x27;m for eliminating discrimination and bias, but I don&#x27;t think this will leave us with a 50-50 perfectly balanced startup scene, but it&#x27;s the most fair. You would either have to change humans&#x27; own free-will preferences for risk, or the nature of the industry (with other side effects). If you have ideas on this, I&#x27;m open to hearing them.<p>This is a legitimate question - shutting down discussion here in the name of being &quot;against progress&quot; or trivializing the issue is highly reminiscent of Paul Graham&#x27;s warnings in &quot;What You Can&#x27;t Say [2]. The demographic balance of any industry or field is always in constant flux, and heavily influenced by self-selection and non-discriminatory factors. We need to remove discrimination, but also know that a fair outcome in the absence of discrimination - with equal opportunity does not necessarily lead to perfectly equal outcomes.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8087536"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8087536</a><p>&quot;Broadly speaking, competition definitely creates sex-based selection-bias.

In fact, you should not rely on any singular thing, but rather separate out  pieces of information so that no part has more than it needs. The test user should not have access to the production database and vice versa. In sum, you should use multiple things to defend yourself, not just one.",1406329421

Comparison to day job is not valid at least directly.<p>For example, if you are putting in T hours of time per day and M amount of money, think about what is the realistic value you could reap from that time and money, taking everything into account.  Whatever is expected to give higher returns for your efforts, resources and stress, should be what you do.<p>Apologies if I stated something that you find obvious.",1406329353

This is a space sorely lacking in options.<p>My amateur radio club has no coherent roster. We&#x27;ve got a couple people volunteering time to take all the application forms at our secretary&#x27;s house and put them into a spreadsheet. But I also have spent some time looking to setup an open source club membership roster online. I even started working on a flask application, but don&#x27;t really have the time to bring it to completion.<p>In my search I found various things revolving around subscription management and a lot of offline club roster type stuff, but nothing that really fit the bill. Most members pay their membership dues in cash, and we&#x27;d also like to denote officers of the club.<p>My goal was that we could add members contact information in directly. If they had an email, then they would be able to use that to login. Alternatively, members could go on the site and register themselves, with a club officer validating and activating their account. Members can update their contact information at any time. Club officers can record membership dues and when the current membership expires. While a nice option, we&#x27;re not really concerned with an ability to pay online or not.<p>There should be privacy checkboxes: share my contact information with club members, share my contact information with with ARES (a 3rd party organization the club is affiliated with and most members are also members of).<p>Finally, members that are authorized should be able to download a roster of members (which is really the whole point).",1406329257

Even thirty year old trijets operated in Africa crash infrequently enough to warrant global news coverage, albeit not news coverage that many people pay much attention to or that the BBC sees fit to create a live update page for.<p>What&#x27;s actually a far bigger coincidence is that there were no fatal 777 crashes in the first 20 years of a >1200 aircraft production run until this year, when two aircraft belonging to the same airline were both total losses in apparently unrelated cases of apparent foul play.
