8085523,comment,8085506,8085506,1,0,Alupis,,,"I would highly recommend starting out by building your own linux distro by following the linux-from-scratch book or similar.[1]<p>You will learn a lot about what goes into making a distro actually boot, how the different pieces of software are interacting with each other, and how to solve and debug typical issues and kernel panics.<p>From there, I think many would recommend attempting to make some sort of Kernel Module, even if it&#x27;s a very basic one that isn&#x27;t of much use. The experience alone will teach you a lot of valuable skills and knowledge.[2]<p>Learning some assembler will help as well. There is a great free ebook from the gnu assembler (GAS) project [3]. Assembler will help teach you how the computer is really doing what it does. This is important if you are going to be working closer to the kernel and most of the critical subsystems, be in Linux or the BSD&#x27;s (even Windows actually). There are many different Assembler languages, but learning some basics in one will help you understand how others work.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.linuxchix.org/content/courses/kernel_hacking/lesson8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linuxchix.org/content/courses/kernel_hacking/less...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/pgubook/ProgrammingGroundUp-1-0-booksize.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/pgubook/Programmin...</a>",1406300362

It highlights the continued disconnect between the interests of the companies traded on the market and those of the investors at large.<p>Bezos has been completely transparent about his philosophy regarding long-term and short-term profitability. This is not out of character for Amazon. Rather the opposite: the day I hear Amazon cutting long-term projects to boost short-term profitability is the day I would sell my Amazon stock. This is the way Amazon has operated for most of its history. They&#x27;ve already built up enough of a track record for us to trust that they know what they&#x27;re doing. It is stupid to expect them to behave like other companies when we have seen them operate in this manner for some 20 years successfully. Maximizing short-term profitability is not a high priority for Amazon, and it never has been. Why is the market surprised then when they re-invest in growth? Because the market can be stupid.",1406300333

Haskell never claimed it would save your soul.<p>Quickly and in particular:<p>Immutability/purity: of course, but being more explicit is beneficial and challenging, so the compiler helps<p>Traits: if you mean typeclasses then they are much more than merely traits<p>Monads: I don&#x27;t think you understand correctly, sorry<p>GPU: You don&#x27;t have to believe it. It exists. Embedded DSLs and cross-compilation are very common in Haskell.<p>Laziness: it&#x27;s not a needed thing at all, it increases composability. SPJ has asked that question, but the jury is still very far out.<p>Closures: Let&#x27;s not argue readability, it just makes everyone look bad. Instead, I agree that Objects and anonymous functions are similar. The point is not to have them, it&#x27;s to have a culture which really does use them everywhere that&#x27;s appropriate.<p>Syntax: not worth arguing about. If you dislike it, you dislike it.<p>True parametric polymorphism: I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about here. Parametricity leads to much more program correctness and specialization recovers speed. Further, parametricity opens up compiler-enforced behavior leading to fusion which dramatically improves speed.<p>Forced to write good code: you really aren&#x27;t, you&#x27;re just forced to mark it as bad code (i.e. live in IO)<p>GHC has custom memory allocations, SIMD probably by the next version, and three different string types.

We&#x27;re always looking for people to help out.<p>You could either work on the main site to improve that for your government or help them get their budgets/expenditure datasets loaded onto openspending.org or, since you&#x27;re a frontend developer you might be more interested in what we refer to as satellite sites (openspending.org can be seen as an analytical machine with an api).<p>Satellite sites are done mostly by people outside of the core team but use the api to visualise budgets and expenditure for citizens in a way that is easy to understand. Some examples of sites include: <a href=""http://wheredoesmymoneygo.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wheredoesmymoneygo.org</a> (for Britain), <a href=""http://budzeti.ba"" rel=""nofollow"">http://budzeti.ba</a> (for Bosnia) or <a href=""http://openbudgetoakland.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openbudgetoakland.org</a> (for Oakland, California). These sites use the openspendingjs library for visualisations (you could contribute new visualisations based on data from your local government).<p>Since I see you&#x27;re based in Denmark you might be interested in this site from Politiken: <a href=""http://kommune.politiken.dk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kommune.politiken.dk/</a> which used our visualisations but not the openspending.org backend or an instance of the OpenSpending software (which is fine, but a bit weird).<p>You might also be interested in knowing that OpenSpending is now mostly led by Nordics. I, the technical lead, come from Iceland while the community lead comes from Denmark (but lives in Washington DC).<p>OpenSpending is a community project founded and facilitated by Open Knowledge which is an organisation you might be interested in. There are a lot of other projects Open Knowledge works on in various fields that most try to help either governments or citizens. Here&#x27;s the Open Knowledge website: <a href=""https://okfn.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://okfn.org/</a><p>Good luck finding an interesting project to do and you can ping me if you&#x27;re interested in OpenSpending (I&#x27;m always around on OpenSpending&#x27;s IRC channel for example).",1406297378
