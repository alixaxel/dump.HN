8083803,comment,8082849,8083599,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"Fair enough critique of the woman in this story. Let&#x27;s temporarily put aside the nature of her failings. I&#x27;d still describe them as naiveté more than greed, per se, but regardless, we can agree she has failings. She&#x27;s not a very sympathetic protagonist. But let&#x27;s talk about others like her.<p>Do you not agree that Airbnb is probably attracting a fair number of would-be landlords to the market who would not be in the market otherwise? Yes, the vacation rental market existed long before Airbnb. No, I don&#x27;t buy the implication that Airbnb is only attracting people who would have operated in the pre-Airbnb vacation market. Clearly Airbnb has expanded the supply side of this market, at least somewhat by enticing new entrants into it, many of whom are probably unversed in the laws and regulations they should be versed in. That&#x27;s not Airbnb&#x27;s fault, but it is Airbnb&#x27;s headache.<p>Regardless of our sympathies toward this woman in this particular case, she might be a canary in a coal mine. There are plenty of theoretical Airbnb hosts, and perhaps actual hosts, who could very easily take the plunge on Airbnb without coming to grips with the ins and outs of rental laws. They would assume, furthermore, that because Airbnb exists and thrives, then surely it must have sorted out the fine print.<p>Airbnb can take actions to prevent this situation from happening again. That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean blocking 30+-day rentals, or cutting back on the range of options one can undertake on Airbnb. But it probably means providing more information, at the very least, triggered by certain actions taken when posting a listing. Not because they have to, but because they know that their business model creates an &quot;easy button&quot; for a lot of unsophisticated users. That&#x27;s a fine business model. But if you&#x27;re going to do that, then you need to design prophylactic solutions to protect people from their own stupidity [greed/arrogance/naiveté/haste/whatever we want to call it in any given case]. You can&#x27;t protect them from everything, but at the very least, you can learn and adapt as you go.<p>Not every PR hiccup deserves a complete redesign of the UX flow, of course. And no solution fixes every potentiality. So you evaluate the problems on a case-by-case basis as they emerge, estimating the likelihood that they&#x27;ll happen again, and weighing the costs of a fix against the benefits. I&#x27;m not a fan of preemptively freaking out about possible edge cases. But when something like this happens, at the very least, you need to analyze whether it&#x27;s a ridiculous edge case, or whether it&#x27;s likely to happen again.<p>And who knows? Maybe this woman&#x27;s mistake serves a sorting function, and the problem solves itself. Nobody will make her mistake again. Or so we&#x27;d hope.",1406263361

I&#x27;d done a few halfs before that but was coming bac to running after a nasty injury and surgery.<p>As others have said the important thing is to get that long slow run in at the weekend - not worrying about pace as much as time on your feet. The furthest I ran in training was just over 20 miles. If you can find people to do that run with - or even part of it - it helps. I listen to podcasts if I run alone!<p>It&#x27;s then also good to do a shorter run in the week at race pace, as well as some sort of speed work.<p>Also, get yourself a foam roller and a tennis ball. Roll your legs, glutes and feet a lot and don&#x27;t forget to add in some core strength and stretching sessions. That will help get you through in one piece and still enjoying running!<p>As already suggested make sure you train with the nutrition you are going to have on the day. It may be that the race is sponsored by some company and they hand stuff out at the water stations to save you carrying it. Make sure you have tried it in training if you intend to use it.

To hack is to have tread that middle ground which keeps the peace and also lets us run things they way they should.<p>4. Going it alone - There is no other way.

The key to lowering your utility bill is to push heavy loads out of the highest rate periods, typically daily like 11am to 2pm, etc. It is all explained (very poorly) on their website. Also, you are given some &quot;base&quot; load for electricity and gas (defined by region) and if you exceed that your rate jumps dramatically. So if you can avoid hitting these limits on a monthly basis you can keep your costs down. Also, nat gas is about 1/3 of the cost of electric so electric heat is very expensive.

NoVA/D.C. is only the home to the second largest tech center in the country, larger than NYCs. You can&#x27;t swing a dead cat without hitting a tech company of any size along the Dulles tech corridor. With a 5% unemployment rate, there are literally thousands of job openings there, the demand is unbelievably high. If that doesn&#x27;t qualify as a large tech industry, then nothing does.<p>Blacksburg and Charlottesville have all the advantages of a place like MIT or Stanford. Nice STEM focused college towns full of ready to work STEM students who&#x27;d love to stay in those towns and low costs of living. If you want to open a remote office, those are good places to do it.<p>Tampa has a sizable tech industry as well. If you didn&#x27;t notice it, it&#x27;s because you, like most people, aren&#x27;t paying attention or you&#x27;ve dismissed every possible company you could have worked for because it wasn&#x27;t in with the cool crowd.

It&#x27;s easier to sell hiring in Hyderabad than in Austin sometimes, and that&#x27;s a shame.<p>While I see posts on San Francisco&#x27;s labor shortage and the desire to get more H-1B visas, I can&#x27;t help think of the hundreds of thousands of qualified tech employees all over the rest of the country. It&#x27;s not expensive to set up a remote office and not hard to manage one either.
