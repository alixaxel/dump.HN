8029457,comment,8028837,8029189,7,0,stan_rogers,,,"It <i>sounds</i> like a good idea, but we humans have a way of making any language that is capable of expressing anything like nuance into local, parochial varieties if we spend time living in the language. Pronunciation will shift, elisions and contractions are going to happen, and the perfect match between orthography and pronunciation will evaporate. Sure, you can adjust the spelling to keep up, but whose dialect is the &quot;real&quot; one? Irregularities will creep in. There will be a tendency to push and pull the word order (and long lists of conjugation and declension affixes that may overcome word order difficulties would be a barrier to use). Oh, yeah: about word order... whose do you use? SVO is common among creoles, but that has as much to do with the vocabulary source languages as anything else (even if it can be argued that SVO is the least marked case). If enough people use the new language often enough for it to be a real breaker of barriers, that will be a relatively short-lived phenomenon. If it is merely a lingua franca, it will be about as expressive as a pidgin in most mouths, and pidgins don&#x27;t say much on paper (or on screen).<p>Bilingualism (or multilingualism) isn&#x27;t the problem, especially if the languages are acquired early. It&#x27;s keeping a &quot;standard language&quot; (that&#x27;s worthy of the name) standard. If people use it, it will change, and those changes will be local (geographically regional, or the internet equivalent). Artificial grammars are just about as real as Bishop Lowth&#x27;s version of English grammar; a heavily-used constructed language will drift toward a grammar that actually makes human sense, with all of the quirks and foibles that implies. It doesn&#x27;t take long for the divergence to become significant. A couple-three decades, and you&#x27;ll have distinct dialects. A couple-three centuries, and they stop being completely mutually comprehensible. A little more time and you&#x27;ll be looking around for the wreckage of the tower.",1405310353
8029456,comment,8028505,8029403,1,0,ddellacosta,,,"> If Jewish people deserve existence (as a group, not individuals), then White people deserve existence as a group.<p>This makes no sense.  Jewish people as a group have a very long shared cultural and religious history.  However, the concept of &quot;white people&quot; is a fairly recent cultural and political construct and has changed dramatically over the years--for example, at one point in the United States Irish and Italians were not considered to be white.

Receivers still extract usable data through long-term correlation, and the fact that GPS is designed so you don&#x27;t need to reliably recover every bit, or anywhere close.<p>This, in turn, means that you can realistically use a one-bit ADC in your receiver, because that only amounts to a few more dB of loss.

I&#x27;ve cooked plenty of meals on it, and it&#x27;s much more convenient to carry around than a propane or white gas stove (as a bonus, you also don&#x27;t walk around with explosives in your backpack).<p>The ability to charge devices is a happy byproduct. It&#x27;s handy when you&#x27;re cooking up some food and want to power up your phone or GPS receiver. It&#x27;s probably not as efficient as a solar charges but (a) a solar charger won&#x27;t cook food, so the Biolite is a convenient multitasker that requires less backpack room, and (b) the solar charger doesn&#x27;t work at night, when it&#x27;s cloudy, and so forth.<p>EDIT: FWIW, I also have a PowerPot, which is mentioned elsewhere in this thread. It&#x27;s pretty cool, and works well; it&#x27;s also my preferred charging method when I am not cooking, since I can just fill it with water and leave it on the campfire for as long as I need (the Biolite, on the other hand, needs constant feeding of fuel to continue running).",1405309305

Sending a command via wifi will let you know (on the phone) that the lockitron is in a power save mode and the command will be executed in 20 minutes (or whatever the actual time) or when you knock on the door. So if you leave the house and forgot to lock the door, you could lock it remotely and know it&#x27;ll lock itself eventually. Knocking does work consistently to wake the device up.<p>It&#x27;s definitely not the same experience though. I live in a condo and have the lockitron on my unit&#x27;s door. I have the choice between opening the lockitron app in the elevator and send the unlock signal via wifi, but that means I&#x27;ll need to knock for sure. Or I could wait until the elevator gets there and try to unlock, and if i&#x27;m really lucky it will be via BLE and unlock instantly, but generally the BLE hasn&#x27;t managed to connect yet and I get no indicator, so I send the command to early and I need to knock anyway.<p>Speed is such a critical factor here.

8029384,comment,8028777,8028777,10,0,rayiner,,,"There are some neat hybrids of GC and RC as well. This is probably state of the art in this area:  <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&ei=xkTDU-GUCtOkyAT-4oKIDQ&url=http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/mckinley/papers/rcix-oopsla-2013.pdf&cd=5&ved=0CC8QFjAE&usg=AFQjCNF44hAyxlBLnQO2xh527_TGA7_vDQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&ei=xkTDU-GU...</a><p>Conceptually, the key insight is that both GC and RC involve tracing. In GC you trace from live roots to find survivors. In RC, you trace from newly dead objects to find others that should also become dead. This has interesting implications when you combine the algorithms in a generational collector.<p>Imagine the following steady state situation. You&#x27;re allocating at X MB/sec, with a young-generation survival rate of 0.1X. Consequently, this is the allocation rate into the old generation. Since we&#x27;re in a steady state, this is also the death rate in the old generation. If you use GC in the young generation and RC in the old generation, you&#x27;ll trace 0.2X MB per second. This holds true even for an extremely large old generation live size. You&#x27;ll never have to trace the whole heap during an old-generation collection, just the objects that die during that interval. And if you&#x27;re in a steady-state, this will be proportional to your allocation rate, not your heap size.<p>Now, ideally, in a tracing GC you can get your work down to being proportional to your allocation rate, but this requires, even ideally, a heap sized at 2x the maximum live size. With an RC old generation, you can get away with a heap not much bigger than your live size.<p>There are also certain advantages in terms of concurrent collection. The nice thing about tracing dead objects is that they are never mutated. So you do it concurrently with the application without worrying about mutations of the object graph, like a concurrent mark-sweep collector has to. The downside is that the write barrier is more complicated.
