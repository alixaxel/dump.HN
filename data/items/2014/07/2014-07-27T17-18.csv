When I built PaperBox (www.gopaperbox.com), our chief competitor was getting about 50K downloads per day - this compared to maybe 50 a day for us back then.  We knew we had a better offering - but we also knew that charging right off the bat would shoot us in the foot.  Instead, we&#x27;ve opted to go the free route to build our user base & brand, and figure out the business model later on.<p>I cannot imagine an app charging and being successful right off the bat unless they have a platform for advertisement (something like Vesper and Daringfireball.com) or it&#x27;s made by a very prominent figure/company.  The reality is there are 10 apps for every idea in the app store (in 2014) and the best app likely won&#x27;t win market share if they charge from the start.",1406483781

For example, I have published 4 Android apps with about 250k combined downloads.  On two of them I did not monetize at all, I just did them for the exercise and because I like to code.  The other two I did monetize, but only in ways that kept non-time costs to $0 so it was all profit (aka no marketing, no employees, no paid services).<p>I&#x27;ve made some decent money off one of the apps, but definitely not enough to live on for any amount of time.

I&#x27;m mostly a designer, so understand that when asking me technical questions but here are a couple notes.<p>1. The name. I bought the domain over a year ago. The term wasn&#x27;t as popular then. Originally the plan was to have the system auto-build after certain external hooks triggered. We still plan to do this and thought it was worthwhile using the name. It&#x27;s a v1.<p>2. Funded through Kickstarter. We raised $40k through Kickstarter and are bootstrapped entirely. I plan on writing a blog post on the pros and cons of raising money this way.<p>3. We have plans to open source everything under MIT. It&#x27;s three of us, so we wanted to get the product out first. We&#x27;re now moving to documenting / refining the code to a level we&#x27;re happy with so we can release it. It doesn&#x27;t just run on a single server, so we&#x27;re trying to figure out elegant ways to make it easier to install.<p>It works mostly as a simple Grunt JS (node) project. We use firebase as a data store and talk to everything through a single page cms.html ember app. That means the actual CMS is realtime, which makes it fun when multiple people are in the CMS as the same time. It also means that we can update the entire CMS by deploying JS files, which makes maintenance on our end pretty easy. &quot;Bug is fixed, just refresh&quot;.<p>We use websockets locally for installing / generating files on the fly through browser actions. Once deployed, we watch for saves and rebuild the sites through remote servers. Search is handled through a hosted Elastic search instance. The goal was to remove as much of the local setup as possible and offload it to us. That means that it only works when you&#x27;re connected to the Internet. Image resizes can be called at the template layer at will.<p>We made it after loving working with things like Jekyll and Cactus but hated that we couldn&#x27;t use it for sites where there needed to be non-coding editors. Even with all the moving parts, it deploys dumb static sites, because we wanted reliability and speed. Also, having worked on complicated Django projects for the last decade I just wanted something that was a relatively one line install.<p>If you have any questions or suggestions please let me know.",1406482624

8093304,comment,8092938,8093292,11,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, the article is a bit misleading in its focus on &quot;employment rates&quot;. It&#x27;s using employment rates <i>on the day of graduation</i>, i.e. people who have an offer lined up before graduating. People who graduate and <i>then</i> interview, starting sometime later, aren&#x27;t counted as &quot;employed&quot; in these numbers. Ultimately almost all STEM PhDs do end up with a job within a year or so, as the article later acknowledges. Later in the article they quote the unemployment rate for STEM-doctoral holders as ~2%, as you found.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s therefore a particularly useful analysis. There are a lot of issues with the STEM-PhD job market, but significant risk of unemployment isn&#x27;t really one of them. Bigger issues are things like whether the opportunity cost is worth it, and the fact that people who go into a STEM PhD really wanting to do <i>research</i> are often disappointed (there are plenty of industry jobs, but many don&#x27;t really involve scientific research).",1406481239

But you could get a world-class baguette[1] in almost any part of town for about a Euro, same with croissants, and produce at the markets for... well, basically a negligible amount of money. I remember getting a small bag of delicious donut peaches for about €1/kilo. The same peaches were €4/kilo at the supermarket. (As an aside, pretty much all the vine tomatoes I ran into, even the ones at the supermarket, tasted amazing, as if they were just harvested from someone&#x27;s garden. The only time I had that experience in the US was when we grew our own tomatoes.) Cheese shops were abundant and had fantastic selections, though I don&#x27;t remember the exact prices. (They were very reasonable.) You could buy a whole rotisserie chicken for €7 or less if you knew where to look; I got these a lot and used the bones for stock. (Tragically, I think I still prefer Costco chicken!) There was a lot of canned terrine, rillettes, pate, etc. in the specialty stores (€5 or less), and a can could last you a week. You could also get them at the butcher shop, but I never found one close to me that had them. Pastries at some of the world-class bakeries were very expensive — €7 to €10 per piece — but they literally looked like jewels and it was worth it for the occasional indulgence. I had many lunch picnics at the parks and it was fantastic every time!<p>Oh, and obviously, there&#x27;s lots of wine, but I&#x27;m not much of a wine drinker so I didn&#x27;t investigate too much. Good beer was surprisingly cheap, though: I found a supermarket near me selling Chimay Blue for €2/11oz.<p>[1]: Literally.

I&#x27;m not sure how they&#x27;re filtering the developers in the survey, but I&#x27;m willing to bet the amount of effort put in, and the actual methods used to &quot;make money&quot; differ wildly among those developers. Apples to oranges.<p>2) 5-10k per app per month for a single developer with a full-time job doing this in his spare time is pretty good. For a 300 employees company, not so much. Similarly, millions a month will sustain a large company and make an individual developer extremely wealthy. What are we comparing?<p>3) I&#x27;ll go out on a limb here and say that games make more than any other category on the app store. They also tend to require a higher budget and production value: better graphics, sounds, a storyline, etc... Maybe the 100 flashlight / todolist apps competing for the same spots don&#x27;t make much money but they also cost nothing besides a weekend of work and the $99 / year ADC membership. I also wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if most of that &quot;1.6%&quot; were game developers. Lumping every app together and trying to get stats out of it doesn&#x27;t tell us anything about how much the developers are spending to get those apps out.<p>4) Obligatory plug: Storm8, the company I work for, is recruiting.
