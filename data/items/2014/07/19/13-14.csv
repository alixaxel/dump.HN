8057481,comment,8053687,8056431,1,0,avsm,,,"Using process checkpointing is indeed one good way to implement fault tolerance.  The Irmin style is more explicit -- the heap itself is tree structured, and the application uses it to checkpoint itself to disk/memory as a matter of course.<p>This ensures that only the minimal state required is stored (as opposed to the entire process heap), and also that state can be reconstructed intelligently to preserve sharing and special resources.  For instance, file descriptors (if running in Unix mode) could be reified to a filename/offset and reopened, and memory mapped areas (such as the shared ring structures that Xen uses) could be re-granted from the hypervisor.",1405778319

8057438,comment,8056329,8056551,1,0,birschtl,,,"Well, almost all of your arguments are true for MEMS based laser projectors from the late 90s only. Today&#x27;s laser projectors are based on standard DLP, LCD or LCos projectors with the main difference of a laser light engine instead of xenon or uhp light bulbs. So, lets address your arguments one at a time.<p><i>>>There are some downsides though since you don&#x27;t get the same viewing angle that you do with standard projection. The reflection off of the screen tends to bounce back almost as straight as it hit...</i><p>This isn&#x27;t true at all. While Lasers do emit coherent light it doesn&#x27;t cause laser to be reflected back straight reasonably more than standard light. The only issues with lasers is speckle which is caused by destructive and constructive interference of coherent light on rough surfaces. And as any projection surface is somewhat rough in respect to small wavelength, manufacturers have to take care of this issue by integrating laser over time inside the light engine. They do of course have trouble with green laser speckle due to the eyes higher sensitivity to green light but nevertheless they can reduce speckle by over 95 percent.<p><i>>>Laser is also nice because you don&#x27;t have to deal with focus. The Focus is fixed.</i><p>This is also only true for MEMS based laser projectors from the 90s. Today&#x27;s laser projectors are based on &quot;standard&quot; projection technology and therefore have changing focus over distance.<p><i>>>Where you do have issues with Lasers is color. Lasers are harder to get to match the Gamut, and harder still to manipulate to represent all the colors in 10 bit color, (10 bits x 4)\nLasers don&#x27;t tend to burn out which is nice.</i><p>Image reproduction is still based on RGB. As long as you choose primaries that lie well outside the standard color spaces (DCI P3, BTU 709) you can always map colors to fit any colorspace inside this gamut. Colordepth is absolutely unaffected of the Laser itself. Only color derivation technology reduces bit depth. For example time sequential light engines like OSRAMs &quot;Phaser&quot; (phosphor laser) do have the same issues like one chip DLPs. You can not fit enough inter color segmentation inside one frame to get enough bit depth. 3 Chip DLPs with one laser engine per color have 10bit and even more color depth.<p><i>>>Laser projectors do have to be optimized for the size of the screen more than projection. With traditional projection the size of the pixel scales up. With Lasers the dot doesn&#x27;t really get larger. This is fine if the projected dot is the right size, or some ratio of the right size...</i><p>You do not shoot the laser &quot;point&quot; directly at the screen as with MEMS based laser projectors. Today&#x27;s laser projectors replace lamps by laser light engines. You still use DLPs or LCos to reproduce the image.",1405777167

If you instead need a distributed set with no strong ordering guarantees, then you can implement this as a series of pull/push/merge operations instead.<p>One interesting exercise we&#x27;re doing at the moment is to build the equivalent of Okasaki&#x27;s purely functional datastructures in Irmin.  Since the module signatures of these datastructures are quite similar to their non-distributed counterparts, it should be possible to swap distributed/local datastructures depending on the deployment scenario of the application (with the local ones being <i>much</i> more efficient due to the lack of remote synchronization).<p>If a datastructure really can&#x27;t merge something, then it can raise a conflict that will can ripple up to the user interface.

The more or less affordable solutions are decades old, running VB macros on top of MS Access databases, they are often incompatible with versions of Windows above XP. Everything seems stitched together over the course of many years by various WYSIWYG Studio dilettantes. Extending such software with new functionality is often hard or even impossible, which their developers admitted on several occasions. For instance, I&#x27;ve once got an estimate of $5000 for integrating an old DIGI scale, with a condition that I&#x27;d manage to find a datasheet for that protocol. I ended up writing a small COM port emulator and used it as a proxy between PoS and the real port.<p>Fun thing about PoS is the huge assortment of various hardware, and all of it could be abstracted in business logic. Almost every country has it&#x27;s own ways of collecting taxes, own currency, own central company registers and different ways of reporting -- all of it should be considered when designing, a dream of every architecture astronaut. In addition come these necessary things like stock control, handheld scanners, BI, printing, Unicode (<i>never seen it supported by any PoS; imagine running an international foods store with ISO Latin-1</i>) and last, but not the least, user-friendliness.<p>I guess the PoS software market is much larger in the States, but what about the average software quality? PoS systems are not going anywhere soon, and I feel that a startup dealing with these issues could definitely see success.

The truth is that we know very little about human nutrition, especially in healthy individuals. When John Ioannidis demonstrated that most published medical research is false (wholly or partially), he singled out nutrition and gene-association as two especially problematic fields. Yet, the reason many believe that reading some papers and changing their diets to include more or less protein -- or more or less fiber, or more or less fat -- has an effect on their health is pure religion and magical thinking. This magical thinking stems from a possibly innate (and certainly ingrained) belief that &quot;our body is a temple&quot;, or that &quot;we are what we eat&quot;, which is a particular manifestation of the more general psychological desire in what Jonathan Haidt calls &quot;purity&quot;. This psychological need is combined with the false[1] seemingly-scientific belief that our bodies accumulate damage over time.<p>The scientific truth is that (other than obviously pathological cases of eating poison, or living on just fries for a year) we simply don&#x27;t know what food is good for us, and certainly not in what quantity. It&#x27;s actually worse: we don&#x27;t even know if diet (again, non pathological) has <i>any</i> effect on health. It is absolutely possible (and even likely), that our bodies are certainly capable of retaining good and disposing of bad nutrients, as long as our diet is somewhere within a very large &quot;normal&quot; range.<p>But nutrition is another of these scientific religions of our times, which infects actual scientists, too, and affects their research (like various papers linking diet to disease through a correlation with cholesterol -- an unproven pathogen).<p>[1]: <a href=""http://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/your-body-wasnt-built-to-last-a-lesson-from-human-mortality-rates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gravityandlevity.wordpress.com/2009/07/08/your-body-w...</a>",1405774879
