8057259,comment,8057043,8057043,2,0,zaptheimpaler,,,"This seems very interesting - its like a graph based computation language! OP - it seems to me that executions of programs in this context are kind of orientations through the graph by drawing arrows all in one direction or the other..<p>So can this run programs in both directions? For example, orienting the NAND gate from &quot;X NAND Y&quot; to X and Y (i.e providing X NAND Y as say, TRUE) would generate the X and Y that could lead to the input? If we added that functionality to the basic gates (i.e allow running OR in reverse and have it return {(X=1,Y=0), (X=0,Y=1)} when given input (X OR Y=1)), and accumulated the possibilities at each step as a tree. Of course, it could take very long to run.<p>Actually, maybe it would even be possible simply fill in certain nodes and propagate out to all connected nodes, keeping track of possible inputs. So it can complete the whole graph (or connected component to be precise) with possible values given any random nodes filled out. So it can give you all possible executions subject to restrictions on any nodes values. That would be awesome!<p>OP - Does that make any sense? If it does, I may try to implement it and see what kinds of cool things we can do with it.",1405770998

8057250,comment,8056978,8056978,20,0,piggyback,,,"This chart is at the very least incomplete and inaccurate if not blatantly false. To accuse Iran of cooperating with Al Qaeda while claiming that Saudi Arabia does not is audacious. Saudi Arabia spreads the most violent branch of Islam (Wahhabism/Salafism) through indoctrination as well as direct funding for terrorism. Just look at the perpetrators of 9/11, all of whom were Sunni Arabs, most of them from Saudi Arabia. The same goes for Qatar, which is missing in the chart. Hamas and Iran broke up because the former (Sunni) joined the fight against the Syria government, which is supported by Iran. \nIran is neither Sunni nor Arab, groups like Al Qaeda and ISIS would love to commit genocide against Iranians. They don&#x27;t have any real allies and have propped up a few Shia proxies in Iraq and the Levant. Others are missing, like the Kurds, so is the the link to Central/South Asia as well, i.e. AfPak. Without Pakistan Al Qaeda and the Taliban could have not existed. It should be noted that the Pakistani government and military are bought and paid for by the Arab states in the Persian Gulf, where Pakistani mercenaries protect the Monarchs from their civilian population, Bahrain being a notable example: the majority of Bahrainis are Shia and they are naturally friendly with Iran/Iraq. Their government, however, is run by the same kind of Sunnis that control countries like Kuwait and the UAE.",1405770742
8057249,comment,8056735,8056735,4,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I feel like we&#x27;re getting a little lost in the weeds here with all the references to paperwork. While I&#x27;m certain that everything in this article is on the level, whether it&#x27;s part of the Patriot Act or Executive Order 12333 is a bit arcane. NSA was recording all overseas calls long before Reagan. During the Cold War and the subsequent War on Terror, the US has basically let the spy agencies run rampant.<p>And that&#x27;s the structural problem: there is no system of checks and balances. Here we have members of the legislative branch saying they have no idea what&#x27;s in various orders and are unable to provide oversight. This is their job! We have the executive branch cutting out the judicial branch in matters involving the Fourth Amendment. Once again, this is the court&#x27;s job. The executive has nothing to do with anything here.<p>Both other branches of government are free at any time to step in and take control. The Congress can shut off funding, hold public hearings, and start sending people to jail. The courts can enjoin various agencies to put a stop to onerous activities. We have all sorts of constitutional levers. Nobody seems to want to use any of them.<p>And so, if the other two branches of our government are going to check-out of doing their job, the executive and hte intelligence agencies will happily step in and make up their own rules and systems of accountability. What we seem to have created is not a system safeguarding the constitution; rather we&#x27;ve created a system where nobody can be individually accountable if anything goes wrong. Everybody has a little bit work to do that on paper appears to make sense. But when you add it all up it doesn&#x27;t do what it&#x27;s supposed to do: defend our way of life while protecting us from those who wish to do us harm.<p>If the other branches of government would get in the game, we might have a chance of straightening this all out.

India for example was ruled primarily by Muslim rulers for over a thousand years but still ended up with a huge Hindu population and a significant Muslim population. If you consider the whole of South Asia, that &quot;Diversity&quot; in religion is even more stark. Since this region has almost 2 Billion people living, it can&#x27;t be considered as different.<p>At the same time, you do have a good point. When you consider colonialism, what it represented was non-assimilation. One criticism of British Colonialism in India has been that unlike other Invasions (Greeks, Persians, Central Asian etc..), the British never did assimilate into India. The Mughals for example were conquerers from Central Asia (descendants from Mongols), but dropped their ties and forged new ones in India. That never happened in Colonialism   not just by the British but every Colonial power. So, in that sense you are right about assimilation but its a bit more complex than that.",1405770078

The Clinical Genomics Database/Web Developer also participates in the development of interactive tools for interpretation of genetic and genomic assays in support of developing high-throughput, clinically accredited pipelines to aid in identifying known variants in hereditary cancers, and in assisting in research towards the development of personalized treatments for other cancers.<p>Duties/Accountablilties:<p>1. Development of interactive websites to allow for sample submission, clinical report retrieval, and analysis interpretation.<p>2. Development of databases for tracking of patient samples, and preparation of reports for Clinical staff and physicians.<p>3. Development of interactive tools to allow for interpretation of results from genetic and genomic assays.<p>4. Quality-assurance testing for websites and databases.<p>5. Development and assessment of bioinformatic tools for detection of genetic variants implicated in oncogenesis.&quot;<p>Quite intense. Far from a mere &quot;presentation layer&quot;, it seems in this case the work involves developing actual clinical research tools --which just happen to be web-based.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ca.linkedin.com/in/hadrienjouet/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ca.linkedin.com/in/hadrienjouet/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bioinformatics.ca/resources/jobs/clinical-genomics-database-web-developer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bioinformatics.ca/resources/jobs/clinical-genomics-da...</a>",1405769531
