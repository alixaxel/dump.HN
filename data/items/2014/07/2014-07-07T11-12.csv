You don&#x27;t want to be lumped in the same pool with the clueless 22-year-olds with little skill, little life experience, and lots of mindless energy. They will beat you at the grunt game. Chances are, you have an edge over them in other things (due to your life experience) but you may not have figured out exactly what that is yet.<p>Though it&#x27;s too late to <i>restart</i>, it&#x27;s not too late to <i>resume</i> your career. It&#x27;s a matter of how you present yourself and what you are trying to do. You can&#x27;t devalue your own career path to this point. You have to be able to make the case that it&#x27;s relevant to the job. Literature: you developed an aesthetic sense by reading well-crafted fiction, and you have a sense of narrative. Philosophy: you&#x27;re used to ordered, logical, methodical thought and you&#x27;ve applied it to a wide array of human problems. Failed IT startup: you&#x27;ve seen how companies operate in good times and bad (OK, maybe just bad) and developed leadership skills (transfer over different experience if you have to). EdX/Coursera: you&#x27;re capable of learning hard material on your own. A lot of people play around in Coursera, but people who actually finish hard courses are pretty rare (and that&#x27;s not a flaw of Coursera; it&#x27;s just an artifact of how people explore and think).<p>I think every programmer in machine learning feels a &quot;lack of math skills&quot;. I was very strong in math in high school and college, placed in a few national math competitions, and sometimes even I struggle with machine learning papers. Keep in mind that you&#x27;re trying to absorb a month or few (or years) of someone&#x27;s work in a few hours. (I studied pure math, so I hadn&#x27;t gotten &quot;down and dirty&quot; with linear algebra for years when I started studying ML.) Except for the full-time category theorists and advanced probabilists to whom gnarly integrals come naturally, we all feel inadequate here. If you just keep studying and keep sharp, you can get yourself ahead of 95% of professional programmers quite quickly.<p><i>do you think, it makes sense to study computer science at the age of 31? or is it too late?</i><p>Fuck no, it&#x27;s not too late. If anything, 31 is too early to <i>stop</i> learning challenging things (which many people do, sometimes even before then).<p><i>do you work at a human resources department and can tell me if there is a chance for those kind of people?</i><p>As you get older, your best bet is less often to go directly through HR. If you&#x27;re at an HR wall, you&#x27;re more likely to face prejudice and harsh age-grading than if you meet someone at a conference. Certainly by 40, almost all of your jobs will be found through networking rather than job sites or front-door applications. Is it ideal that things are that way? No. It&#x27;s something to keep in mind. The good news is that you&#x27;re probably way more socially capable and confident than you were at 22, so the networking is less scary.",1404734217

I&#x27;ve hosted my .NET stuff with <a href=""http://www.discountasp.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.discountasp.net</a> for years and yes, they&#x27;re not free, they&#x27;re cheap. There are cheaper alternatives than them for IIS, but I like them. They provide a good service. Free doesn&#x27;t float my boat because I don&#x27;t want to worry about platform installation, patching and so on. I don&#x27;t want to do more than FTP to publish.<p>Also interesting is that I could move to Azure without making a single change to my code. So Azure doesn&#x27;t lock me into anything either.<p>&quot;<i>But that&#x27;s [.NET] just a dependency when you opt for the Microsoft world</i>&quot;<p>Yes. It is a dependency. If I used Node, then Node.js would be a dependency. If I used Rails, then Rails would be a dependency. I don&#x27;t get that dependency problem - we&#x27;re all of us always going to be dependent on something, somewhere. Unless you code up your own OS, stack and tools, and make your own hardware.<p>Lock-in to Micro$oft is also something I&#x27;ve yet to hear a commercially convincing argument against. Is it really so bad? They&#x27;ve been around since the 80&#x27;s. They&#x27;re not going to disappear soon either. They strike me as a safe bet. Why is lock-in such an issue?<p>If vendor dependence is really such an issue, then design (architecture, if you will) is your mitigation. Abstraction solves that problem (actually any problem, bar performance).<p>As ever, when I hear these arguments against Microsoft and the .NET stack I hear consistency bias. Our nearly obsessive desire to be (and appear to be) consistent with what we have already done. Once we&#x27;ve made a choice, we encounter personal and interpersonal pressures to behave consistently with that commitment.<p>Node.js is cool. So is LAMP, .NET, COBOL and GW BASIC. Your choice is the right choice. For you. For your situation. If you&#x27;re going to throw stones at my choice (not saying you are), I&#x27;d like to hear <i>how</i> lock-in to Microsoft will burn me. And after 14 years of hosting my stuff on IIS and developing with the Express Editions of Visual Studio, I&#x27;d love to know how it is more expensive than something else that provides a comparable development experience and service.",1404734016

Judging from her recent media appearances, it seems actually likely that she will act in one way or another.<p>A probable &quot;retaliation&quot; could be to cancel the free trade treaty that&#x27;s currently being negotiated between the US and the EU (and which, like most EU projects, depends heavily on Germany&#x27;s consent), which would be a huge economic loss for the US (and to th EU as well of course). So, although this move was &quot;business as usual&quot; for the US, it could have pretty serious consequences for them.

7998290,comment,7996980,7997840,2,0,chriswarbo,,,"&quot;Statically-typed&quot; and &quot;type-safe&quot; don&#x27;t mean the same thing.<p>&quot;Type-safe&quot; means that the type of a value is always correct. For example, if I have a function of type Int -> String, a type-safe language will not let me pass it a Float argument, no matter what I do. A type-unsafe language might let me, if I can &quot;cast&quot; the value to a new type without changing its representation (ie. it&#x27;s still a Float, but the type-checker now thinks it&#x27;s an Int).<p>Type-safe languages are preferred over type-unsafe languages, since they avoid all kinds of problems like undefined behaviour.<p>&quot;Statically-typed&quot; means that every variable, function argument, return value, etc. is associated with (usually one, &quot;principle&quot;) type. These may be written explicitly, inferred, etc.<p>&quot;Dynamically-typed&quot; means that all values use the same static type. This type is usually a recursive sum of lots of useful types, for example (in pseudo-Haskell):<p><pre><code>    type UniType = I Int | L [UniType] | F (UniType -> UniType) | O (Object UniType) | E Error | ....\n</code></pre>\nDynamically-typed languages are type-safe, but in a trivial way: there&#x27;s no way for a value to have the wrong type, since there&#x27;s only 1 type!<p>Many users of dynamically typed languages don&#x27;t realise that static types are being used &quot;behind the scenes&quot;, because:<p>* All of their code has the same type, so there&#x27;s no need for any annotations, inference, type-checking or compilation. Many believe it&#x27;s because there are no types, rather than the fact these have been made trivial.<p>* Sum types and recursive types aren&#x27;t widely known, especially to those using dynamic languages who don&#x27;t need to care about types at all. Hence, many make the assumption that &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to type this code&quot; implies &quot;this code is untypeable&quot; and refer to such things as &#x27;dynamic behaviour&#x27;.<p>* Many dynamic languages are implemented in languages with unsafe, anemic type systems, like C. Since &#x27;dynamic behaviour&#x27; can&#x27;t be represented safely in these languages, it&#x27;s implemented unsafely, reinforcing the assumption that dynamic languages aren&#x27;t type-safe.<p>* Other dynamic languages are implemented in themselves, which hides the UniType underlying it all.<p>* A few dynamic languages are implemented in languages with strong, safe type-systems, where the UniType is explicit and obvious, but most users stick to the dynamic language and never look at the implementation.<p>* Many languages confuse terminology by using the word &quot;type&quot; to refer to tags (the &quot;I&quot;, &quot;L&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, ... in my UniType above); for example &quot;if (get_type(x) === &quot;int&quot;) {...}&quot; instead of &quot;if (get_tag(x) === I) {...}&quot;, but this doesn&#x27;t make sense: types don&#x27;t exist at runtime and even if they did the &quot;get_type&quot; function would always return the same thing (the UniType). The fact that many languages represent tags as strings doesn&#x27;t help either!<p>* Dynamic languages allow any variable to contain any value, but most of the time only a small part of this domain is expected. This causes most functions to be partial, but whenever this partiality is encountered, one of two things happens: a) the program fails with a &quot;runtime type error&quot;, which is incorrect and doesn&#x27;t make sense, b) the language supplies an error value in response, and is regarded as doing something &quot;unsafe&quot; or &quot;untyped&quot;, when in fact error values are perfectly valid (I&#x27;ve tagged them with &quot;E&quot; above) and it&#x27;s the programmer&#x27;s fault for not handling all of the possible cases they (implicitly, via UniType) asked for.<p>The work you&#x27;ve linked to is about <i>selectively</i> weakening the types in a program, so rather than having the whole thing be unityped or the whole thing use distinct types, instead we can write code both ways, then automatically strengthen/weaken the types and lower/lift the functions, so that they interoperate. The types are always safe, but the unityped part will have many more partial functions than total functions.<p>In contrast, we can&#x27;t (yet) make a type system &quot;gradually safe&quot;, since a single unsafe cast can break anything else (&quot;ex falso quodlibet&quot;). It would require some kind of para-consistent logic, which I&#x27;ve never seen in type theory. The difference is that &#x27;gradual types&#x27; let us say &quot;Any&quot; instead of &quot;Int&quot;, whereas unsafe types let us say &quot;X&quot; instead of &quot;Int&quot;, for any &quot;X&quot;.",1404733597

Everything is standard, and most companies have them as part of MSDN. Majority of established .net enterprise environments use SQL Server with either ASP.NET webforms or MVC.net running on IIS + Win Server. What open source considers &quot;vendor lock-in&quot; is considered &quot;standardised technology&quot; in enterprise environments. When considering client work the first question is: &quot;right what do you need to do?&quot; and not &quot;right, what stack are you using&quot;.<p>With Java, one client I have to learn Struts, another client I have to learn Play, then another client I have to learn JEE. I know Gradle in and out, but another contract requires me to know Maven, while another contract requires me to know Ant. Standalone server? Or Tomcat / Apache / WebSphere?<p>With Node, everyone has their own templating language (Jade or Handlebars or other). Some use CoffeeScript over plain Javascript. Some use SASS/LESS/ or just plain CSS. Some forward proxy using Haproxy, others NginX.<p>The point is: while the .net stack is pretty narrow, we know it works in the majority of use cases.

The default installation mode is server core. It requires dramatically fewer patches. Management with PowerShell is incredibly powerful. IIS has seen many, many improvements.<p>Also, &quot;developing your app for azure&quot; is a weird statement. If you develop for Azure Websites you are literally just writing an asp.net web app or api. it runs in IIS in a VM. It just has some management wrapped around it so that you don&#x27;t have to take care of the VM(s). It has autscale, monitoring, and all the stuff you would expect from a cloud provider. Writing your app to use SQL Azure, or Azure storage, or something like that is just like using the comparable services from Amazon. It&#x27;s like anything else...you should implement its usage as an interface so you can swap it out if need be.<p>Some people on HN have accused me of working for MS just because I use their stuff. I&#x27;m not, nor have I ever been, a MS employee. I&#x27;ll admit that I started looking into windows a couple of years ago because I was bored with Linux and Unix. I&#x27;ve found that if you put the time in to understand how it works its incredibly productive and thorough. If you try to make it work like unix it will suck. If you learn PowerShell and stay away from the &quot;clickety-clickety&quot; thing it&#x27;s awesome.<p>From a development standpoint I actually like the total stack approach...but that&#x27;s me. If you need to use best of breed components you can still do that with .Net. For me though, my interests shifted to C++ a while ago, so .Net stuff for web api&#x27;s get&#x27;s the work done when I have to do it. I would like to see more stuff like openstack in the .net world, but system center is fine. The stuff that I do ends up being important enough for enterprises that getting funds for that kind of thing is just part of the package.<p>That&#x27;s another thing. I&#x27;m completely uninterested in startups. I&#x27;ve worked at startups in various roles in the past and I&#x27;m just over it. Any startup that I built would have to be something that I could run by myself that immediately made money that I would keep. Investment funding is shit. It&#x27;s a hassle that is super crazy. Dealing with &quot;business&quot; types that aren&#x27;t technical enough to understand the challenges is also completely off the table. If you did choose to work with a VC then it&#x27;s much better to be making money and talking about selling out totally instead of implanting them in your life. Shudder.<p>The one thing that I think Windows needs is a container style app deployment model. The coolest thing going in large scale app building is CoreOS. Its the future of how a large scale app will be built and deployed.<p>The new, and much loathed, metro applications are actually a good starting place for building a container system. They use feature called &quot;app containers&quot; that was first introduced in Vista. Add to that an app package that installs and uninstalls as a unit, called APPX. They haven&#x27;t made any noise about using the new app model for servers, but it would be a great idea. It uses an API monitor that stops calls to things like LoadLibrary or GetProcAddress and all the other API&#x27;s that let you bootstrap malware.

Then, you&#x27;d need a way to differentiate between two pipes.

I&#x27;m not sure how feasible either are, but I&#x27;m sure you can imagine that this problem could be solved. Then, if the shell sees that whichever process accepts the output of `ls` doesn&#x27;t understand objects, just text, then it calls `.toString` on every object and renders that to oldschool character stdout.",1404732425

7998189,comment,7997790,7997967,4,0,skrebbel,,,"OK, here goes. I&#x27;m not saying that we made the right choice all over, but this is what we currently have:<p>For the API we use ServiceStack (v3, because v4 is paid and has a ridiculously high license fee). It is the best-designed REST API library I&#x27;ve ever seen, in any language. Its focus on data and not on verbs makes it easy to build well-designed APIs and difficult to build crappy ones.<p>The API is the executable, self-hosting an HTTP server (using ServiceStack&#x27;s support for the .NET HttpListener). We&#x27;ll probably switch to FastCGI soon. In any case, we have an Nginx in front to serve all static assets, which proxies API calls through to our API.<p>The database layer is very lean: we rely heavily on Postgres stored procedures for much of our data logic. This way, we avoid a lot of roundtrips to the DB and back. We go as far as using Postgres&#x27;s multiple cursor feature to return hierarchical data without repeating lots of data in a giant single JOIN. We then use C# to tie the pieces back together (e.g. imagine a blog example, if we&#x27;d have a query for certain posts AND their top 5 comments, we&#x27;d get one cursor for posts and one for all comments, in order, and then we tie each post to a set of comments in C#-o-world while mapping it to DTOs).<p>The queried data goes from what the stored procedures return straight into the DTOs that ServiceStack returns, so we have no &quot;domain model&quot; class structure or a heavy weight ORM. We use Dapper for easily mapping stuff to simple classes.<p>We insert/update data with ServiceStack.OrmLite - just simply adding rows. Often, an API DTO matches a DB table close enough that this just works without any extra mapping.<p>I general, we&#x27;re convinced that heavy-weight ORMs don&#x27;t make sense for backends which are little more than data-stores for single-page web apps.<p>We manage DB schema changes (and all stored procedures) using hand-written SQL scripts, much like how the Play framework does this (1.sql for the initial DB, 2.sql for changes since v1, etc). This works amazingly great, and gives us far greater control than any ORM ever gave me.<p>We host it all with Docker containers: one for the DB data (Docker&#x27;s &quot;data-only container&quot; pattern), one for Postgres itself, one for the backend (running Mono 3.2.something on ubuntu 14.04), one for Nginx, and one for our static assets (so we can redeploy frontend code without restarting the nginx container). Currently, we&#x27;re host it all at <a href=""http://orchardup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orchardup.com</a> but we&#x27;re not too happy with their very slow (but friendly) customer support. Docker has given us a bunch of headaches (for example, that data only container pattern is a lot less easy to set up in practice), but none .NET/Mono related.<p>Our frontend is a single-page web app, optimized for mobile, built with React and TypeScript.",1404731528

I know those guys[1] are a minority, but it takes only a minority to create an absolutely toxic atmosphere. Maintaining a end user product can lead to frustrating interactions, and it doesn&#x27;t really help if your choice of technology means that there exists a significant number of people who literally want you, your spouse, your three year old daughter and the family dog to die in a fucking fire.<p>b) Mono was always a bad choice for asp.net, which means that the software people <i>are</i> actually paid for doesn&#x27;t run well on Linux. That was mostly a problem outside of xamarins control, and I hope it becomes better not that the devdiv MS seems to be somewhat committed to work together to make it truly interoperable.<p>[1] Just look at the comments at <a href=""http://techrights.org/2013/02/09/tombye/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techrights.org/2013/02/09/tombye/</a>.",1404731220

The majority of international remittance recipiants don&#x27;t have bank accounts, and the cash they receive from their emmigrant relatives goes to immediate consumption needs<p>Are (US) dollar bills a workable substitute for pesos at the receiving end?  I mean, can a rural Mexican without a bank account buy what he or she needs with dollars?  Or does her or she need pesos?<p>(Not rhetorical: I really don&#x27;t know.)<p>In other words, sure, I understand that BTC are not useful in rural Mexico because many have not heard of them, and most who have heard of them do not trust them, but surely everyone in Mexico knows that US dollar bills retain their value.",1404731162

They also light up when you get your card back. Do you have any idea what that is?<p>I assume it’s some sort of defense mechanism against skimmers, but I have no idea whether that’s actually the case.
