In my country where they&#x27;re starting up, the drivers do not always ring to say they are on their way (some I have to ring them first) and some offer drinks, while others don&#x27;t. Usually they tend to be very unfamiliar with the roads and takes longer than the 15 minutes estimate to arrive.

8100968,comment,8099713,8099806,8,0,heavenlyhash,,,"Hi moxie, might I ask if you&#x27;ve considered SHA-384 instead?<p>If I understand correctly, SHA-256 is part of the SHA-2 family of hash algorithms, and like SHA-1, when used alone it is subject to length extension attacks.<p>SHA-384 is also a member of the SHA-2 algorithm family, but is immune to length extension attacks because it runs with an internal state size of 512 bits -- by emitting fewer bits than its total internal state, length extensions are ruled out.  (Wikipedia has a great table for clarifying all these confusing names and families of hashes: [5].)  Other hashes like BLAKE-2 [1], though young, also promise built-in immunity to length-extension attacks.  mdm [2] is immune to this because the relevant git datastructures all include either explicit field lengths as a prefix, or are sorted lists will null terminators, both of which diffuse length extension attacks by virtue of breaking their data format if extended.<p>Not that it&#x27;s by any means easy to find a SHA-256 collision at present; but should collisions be found in the future, a length extension attack will increase the leverage for using those collisions to produce binaries that slip past this verification.  An md5 Collision Demo[3] by Peter Selinger is my favourite site for concretely demonstrating what this looks like (though I think this[4] publication by CITS mentions the relationship to length extension more explicitly).<p>(I probably don&#x27;t need to lecture to you of all people about length extensions :) but it&#x27;s a subject I just recently refreshed myself on, and I wanted to try to leave a decent explanation here for unfamiliar readers.)<p>--<p>I&#x27;m also curious how you handled management of checksums for transitive dependencies.  I recall we talked about this subject in private back in April, and one of the concerns you had with mdm was the challenge of integrating it with existing concepts of &quot;artifacts&quot; from the maven/gradle/etc world -- though there is an automatic importer from maven now, mdm still requires explicitly specifying every dependency.<p>Have you found ways to insulate gradle downloading updates to plugins or components of itself?<p>What happens when a dependency adds new transitivity dependencies?  I guess that&#x27;s not a threat during normal rebuilds, since specifying hashes ahead of time already essentially forbids loosely semver-ish resolution of dependencies at every rebuild, but if it does happen during an upgrade, does gradle-witness hook into gradle deeply enough that it can generate warnings for new dependencies that aren&#x27;t watched?<p>This plugin looks like a great hybrid approach that keeps what you like from gradle and while starting to layer on &quot;pinning&quot; integrity checks.  I&#x27;ll recommend it to colleagues building their software with gradle.<p>P.S. is the license on gradle-witness such that I can fork or use the code as inspiration for writing an mdm+gradle binding plugin?  I&#x27;m not sure if it makes more sense to produce a gradle plugin, or to just add transitive resolution tools to mdm so it can do first-time setup like gradle-witness does on its own, but I&#x27;m looking at it!<p>--<p>Edited: to also link the wikipedia chart of hash families.<p>--<p>[1] <a href=""https://blake2.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blake2.net/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/polydawn/mdm/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/polydawn/mdm/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20071226014140/http://www.cits.rub.de/MD5Collisions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20071226014140/http://www.cits.ru...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-512#Comparison_of_SHA_functions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-512#Comparison_of_SHA_func...</a>",1406615373
