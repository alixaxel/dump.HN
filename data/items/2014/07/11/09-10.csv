Are you paying for college, do you have a scholarship, etc.?<p>I think anyone can make it without a degree given sufficient motivation. I&#x27;m doing a degree because I recognize I don&#x27;t have the motivation to teach myself certain areas of &quot;hard&quot; math, statistics, and theoretical CS. Yet I recognize that these topics will be useful. All of these topics can be learned through MOOCs/MIT OCW today (given sufficient motivation).<p>An alternative you could consider is to try transferring to a top CS school like MIT/Berkeley/CMU/Stanford/UIUC, or to another all-around top school. You may find that you&#x27;ll be seriously challenged and stretched at those schools (or maybe not). This depends on your financial situation, though.",1405072658

Soon we won&#x27;t be able to handle even bacterial infections due to our stupidity to abuse the antibiotics! Every time I get a sore throat, I think how hopeless we are! Yes, medicine has advanced in certain areas like on the butchery side, we understand some things better now, but we&#x27;re so far from being in control! The overregulation, especially in the States, and trying to apply moral and other norms inappropriately, is threatening our existence, when the only moral that matters is survival. When I read labels bragging with &quot;not tested on animals&quot;, I don&#x27;t get. I love animals, but I put humans first! I&#x27;m sure First World pets live a much healthier and comfortable life than millions of Africans, let&#x27;s say, but that&#x27;s off-topic, sorry. So, should we test on humans or not test at all? We&#x27;re so close to a virus or a bacteria eradicating the mankind, so, top priority should be putting all efforts on dealing with infectious diseases. I really don&#x27;t get why Western medicine is not paying attention to Phage Therapy, that&#x27;s been successfully used in USSR for nearly a century with great success. When I was a kid in Eastern Europe, although antibiotics were available and effective, immunoglobulin therapy was still used and was effective. When my son got an ear infection recently, the doctor didn&#x27;t do culture and prescribed one antibiotic, it didn&#x27;t work, she prescribed another, it didn&#x27;t work either, she prescribed a third one - all this to save the cost of doing culture. All this at the expense of devastating my son&#x27;s gut flora. Of course, we overloaded him with probiotics, but it&#x27;s really hard to compensate for the damage done. In fact, there are many who believe the obesity and chronic disease pandemic is also due to antibiotics and damaged gut flora.",1405071459

If they applied that standard uniformly I think half the paper billionaires would be off the list. Silicon Valley companies are ridiculously overvalued if you consider P/E ratio. For example,Toyota  which had profits of $18 billion is valued at $190.2 billion whereas Facebook which had profits of $1.914 billion  is valued at $166 billion. To those  arguing about Facebook&#x27;s potential- I am not sure Facebook will be around 10 years from now, but I am pretty sure Toyota will be.

Anyone who used Craigslist or eBay over the past 10-15 years can tell you that as such systems grow from tens or hundreds of thousands of users to tens or hundreds of millions, the experience becomes very different.<p>Today we can rely on Uber&#x27;s mutual rating system.  We used to do the same on eBay, but eventually a &quot;business decision&quot; was made and eBay switched to quasi-unilateral ratings (sellers cannot negatively rate buyers anymore).<p>Today when an Uber driver picks us up, it is likely that they are reasonably in touch with modern society, probably at least a little bit educated, etc.  Craigslist used to be like that too.
