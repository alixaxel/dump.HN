But don&#x27;t let the facts stop your rightousness ;-)<p>>  It&#x27;s unfortunate we don&#x27;t have any data whatsoever to disprove that...<p>But we do: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide#Psychosocial_states"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide#Psychosocial_states</a><p>You&#x27;ll note that: Hopelessness, loss of pleasure, depression and anxiousness all increase the likelihood of suicide.

7982742,comment,7981168,7981870,1,0,antimagic,,,"Interesting - I do something similar, except that I fast for 24 hours <i>before</i> getting on the plane. Nothing but water for that period.  Once on the plane though, I generally eat the first meal - it helps me to go to sleep on the plane - but no alcohol.  Of course, if your someone that can&#x27;t sleep in a plane seat, you&#x27;re probably better off with your system, as mine is all about getting me ready to sleep on the plane.<p>The other trick for me is to try and arrive at night, so I can pretty much go straight to bed.  When I wake up the next morning I&#x27;m in the right timezone.<p>If for whatever reason I can&#x27;t organise to arrive in the evening, I just suck it up and stay awake until a normal bedtime (no cheating, although it&#x27;s tempting, going to bed early will just leave you out of sync with the clock).  It helps if you can be outside in the sun during the day whilst doing this.<p>One last thing, sometimes your problem is not having to stay awake until night, but that night arrives too quickly because you&#x27;ve flown east.  In this case, my solution is to prepare by making sure I only sleep 3-4 hours the night before, meaning that even if it&#x27;s 5pm bodyclock time and midnight wall clock time, I&#x27;m nevertheless ready to go to bed.<p>At any rate, I&#x27;m no longer young, but I travel at least a couple of times a year, and I have zero problems with jetlag.",1404392334

While there are ways to infer what sort of traffic is being carried from certain packed inspection and statistical techniques (a bulk HTTP transfer will look different to a peer-to-peer one and both will look very different to an interactive SSH session, and so on) you can&#x27;t do that for the content.<p>There are five groups using Tor and similar by my understanding (in no particular order): criminals (including terrorists, people  trafficers, illegal drug industry people, and so forth), the oppressed and freedom fighters (depending on your point of view a lot of people in this category might belong in the first one instead and vice-versa), the paranoid who think the whole world is out to get them, those wanting to protect all their content+comms whether secret or not out of principal, and those who are simply experimenting with it (out of &quot;random&quot; interest, academic interest, or because they work in a relevant/related field).<p>The proportion of nefarious types (relative to the total user-base) routinely using Tor is going to be significantly higher then the proportion of such who are not, so the authorities are naturally going to look to Tor for that reason. They are not saying that they think everyone using Tor is a terrorist, they are saying some are but we can&#x27;t tell who so we are going to check everyone.<p>The only way this will change is if everything is thusly protected, so there will be no difference between the diversity of Tor users and the diversity of the overall population.",1404392131

From an outsider&#x27;s perspective, the major difference between the Amish and the Hutterites is that the Hutterites embrace more technologies that have a primary work purpose.    They may not have cars, but they do have trucks and million dollar combine harvesters.<p>The nature of their colonies makes the Hutterites very good at surviving and thriving the boom and bust cycle of modern farming.   They save up money during boom years (like the past few years), and then buy up a large amount of land and equipment during the bust years (excessive rain has already drowned a large portion of this year&#x27;s crop).  The birth rate of the Hutterites means that they&#x27;re always expanding.  Non-Hutterite farms are expanding too due to the ever increasing cost and efficiency of farm machinery, but they&#x27;re also selling out to the Hutterites as sons and daughters move to the city.<p>Having a colony expand into your area can destroy a community.  Hutterites are good neighbours, but they are not part of the community.   Your community school may close due to poor attendance.   Machinery dealers that have a good reputation may thrive, but other businesses wither.",1404391653

Well, a typical wireless chip consumes several mA during rx/tx, not 0.026mA.

Thus was born the unregulated minibus taxi industry.<p>It all started off well, but soon, instead of a Free Enterprise utopia of owner-operators looking after their vehicles, as was envisaged, owners bought fleets of taxis and &quot;the miracle of the 80&#x27;s became the nightmare of the 90&#x27;s&quot; as they engaged in brutal &quot;taxi wars&quot; over routes.<p>As far as I know, drivers pay &quot;rent&quot; to the owners, and then keep the remainder of the takings for the day, incentivising extreme recklessness and lawlessness as they try to complete as many trips as possible (there are some South African libertarian types who claim minubus taxis are safe, but the road safety figures they cite are certainly incomplete and probably wrong).<p>Attempts to re-regulate have to a large extent, failed,  and when Bus-Rapid-Transit was started in Johannesburg, taxi owners got a cut (with the implicit threat that drivers/passengers would be killed if they didn&#x27;t).<p>Yes, there was a general breakdown in law and order during the transitional period in South Africa during the 1990&#x27;s that wouldn&#x27;t happen in other countries, but it is a reminder that this sort of business needs to be kept well regulated.<p>EDIT: There was also an epidemic of violence on trains (an old and decrepit network serving the larger black townships) during the chaos of the early 1990&#x27;s. As far as I know, the perpetrators were never found, even though elements of the apartheid regime were suspected at the time.

But the author brought it up. And he misunderstood why the flood of AOL addresses on the Internet in the mid 90s was a bad thing. It wasn&#x27;t just because aol.com was ubiquitous. It was that the aol.com email address usually signified an ignorance of Internet norms, technology, etc.<p>Pre-AOL, most people on the Internet were either there because they were at a college (student or faculty), or because they purposely sought out a provider which usually wasn&#x27;t advertised or widely known.<p>Really AOL is to blame for giving their users access to this new place without telling them any of the etiquette of that place.
