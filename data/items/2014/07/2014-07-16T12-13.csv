L1 C/A looks spikey if you zoom out but its really a meg or so wide and only 20 dB or so above the rest of the spectrum anyway.  From what I understand of the modulator its not possible to output a carrier other than bleed thru probably 60 dB down or equipment failure.  BPSK modulation just doesn&#x27;t work that way.<p>Maybe you&#x27;re talking about the L3 signal?  I find that part of GPS to be spooky.

(They may not be the best practice, but it&#x27;s still possible.)<p>Smart pointers are not just reference counting, e.g. the single owner pointer types Box (in Rust) and unique_ptr (in C++). Furthermore, the majority of the cost with many reference counting implementations is the atomic instructions required for safety, if you can get away with non-atomic instructions then the reference counting probably won&#x27;t look so bad. (Rust can express a reference counted pointer that is statically restricted to a single thread `Rc`, while also providing the more expensive threadsafe one `Arc`.)<p>Rust is designed to offer the similar power in terms of controlling memory access patterns.",1405515348

The &quot;multiple competing market makers who are all profitable&quot; all have extremely fast connections to the market.  They compete on relatively equal footing speed-wise, and so other factors come into play.  But everyone outside of the small group of players with that speed advantage will always be paying a tax to those who do.  And good luck compensating for your lack of speed by out-predicting large teams of MIT-educated quants with unlimited technology budgets.  As an individual investor, your only hope for profit is that market values of the stocks you invest in rise by more than the tax you have to pay to HFT&#x27;s.  You better buy and hold, because with every transaction, you&#x27;re paying them an additional tax.<p>When market values are rising, these effects go unnoticed because everyone is generally making money.

8041703,comment,8041560,8041560,1,0,dkersten,,,"IMHO there are two aspects.<p>Technical:<p>Read a lot of new material: articles, books, source code. The more it is different from what you already know the better. Get as diverse a coverage as possible. Same goes for programming languages. A good starting point is the book <i>&quot;Seven languages in seven weeks&quot;</i> because it covers a broad spectrum of language types.<p>But much more important than reading is doing: write a lot of code. Do the exercises in books you read, try out what you see in examples/articles/source code. Change things just to see what happens etc. Also lots of projects (from the tiny to the large) to put what you&#x27;re learning to the test (and then make changes to your understanding based on trying things out). Contributing to open source projects isn&#x27;t necessary, but definitely helps because you will learn a lot about how other people work and also get to take part in a much larger project than you would do on your own. There is unfortunately no shortcut or cheat to get out of actually <i>doing</i> stuff. No matter how much you read, you can&#x27;t become great without writing a lot of code too.<p>The second aspect is do things that help you be an stay as sharp as possible:<p>Get a lot of sleep. Get plenty of exercise. Get fresh air. Make sure you have a decent diet. I&#x27;d recommend specifically dedicating some of that 72 hour budget to getting more sleep and exercise. Also, when trying to solve tough problems, go outside to mull them over. Or sleep on it. Lots of downtime helps your brain make sense of things (I&#x27;m a big fan of &quot;Hammock Driven Development&quot;). Find ways to deal with stress too. Short term stress might help focus, but long term I find it kills concentration and problem solving ability.<p>Seriously though, the technical aspect is important, but don&#x27;t neglect the health aspect as it really does make a huge difference in my opinion.",1405514691

If there are multiple exchanges, and someone trades with them on one exchange, then the set of information available to them has changed (specifically, their knowledge of the supply/demand balance for a particular stock has changed). It&#x27;s only natural that they will want to change their prices in response.<p>Now, we could change legislation to either (a) go back to having a single exchange or (b) restricting the ability of market makers to move their quotes on one exchange if they trade on another. But that won&#x27;t necessarily result in a better deal for non-market makers, because instead of quoting 20,000 shares split across 4 exchanges, the market maker now quotes 5,000 shares on 1 exchange.<p>The benefit is that all market participants have a more accurate idea of the true liquidity available in the market.

We can&#x27;t win this fight by imagining violent revolutions. Dictators become dictators by being practiced in using violence to gain power. We probably can&#x27;t learn enough about violent means soon enough to overcome a slide to dictatorship in any country.<p>I advocate nonviolent means to fight dictators for two reasons: I don&#x27;t like seeing my innocent neighbors get killed, and I have seen nonviolent means work to overthrow dictators. The largely peaceful transition from martial law and one-party dictatorship to pluralistic rule by law with free press and free elections that I saw in Taiwan[1] is just one example of a people power revolution where the dictator was baffled because there were few violent incidents on the part of the opposition to stir up a violent response from the regime. There are other examples from around the world.<p>An organization that collects real-world advice on how to win freedom even under dictatorship nonviolently, and how to keep the revolutionary movement from turning into another dictatorship, is the Albert Einstein Institution founded by Gene Sharp, an occasional nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize. I have recommended before here on Hacker News that readers who are really, truly interested in winning freedom for themselves and guaranteeing freedom for people around the world ought to read the free, downloadable materials on the Einstein Institution website.[2] If you are not willing to learn the art and craft of forging a cohesive, effective resistance movement based on real-world examples, this is all just talk. Talk is cheap. I know actual freedom fighters who succeeded against dictators whose techniques included total control of all mass media with &quot;prior restraint&quot; of publication and complete domination of the country&#x27;s education system and targeted assassinations of opponents. The dictators still lost. You (we) can win, but only if you (all of us) learn to fight effectively. That doesn&#x27;t take violence. Winning in a people power democracy movement does take mental toughness, because the dictator&#x27;s side could use violence, but always the people outnumber the rulers. The people just have to learn how to stand together, overcoming their own fear.<p>Start your reading with <i>From Dictatorship to Democracy: A Conceptual Framework for Liberation</i> if you are wondering where to start among the several handbooks on the Einstein Institution website.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5985720"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5985720</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.aeinstein.org/downloads/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aeinstein.org/downloads/</a>",1405512563

So that would mean if the ISS was orbiting at the same level as the GPS satellites the astronauts would age faster, but since the ISS is closer, they age slower.",1405512148
