Of course every programming language has some.<p>It is a very weird argument that often comes up when discussing programming languages - &quot;Lang X is weird/stupid in some ways, but no language is perfect, so it&#x27;s fine and there is no reason to call it out.&quot;<p>So, because nothing is perfect (almost by definition), it apparently isn&#x27;t a big deal that some things are weird/dumb/broken. And let&#x27;s also just muddy the waters by implying that, since all languages have imperfections, talking about some other language&#x27;s imperfections is just being pointlessly selective (even though one of the languages imperfections are much more horrible).<p>It&#x27;s just overall a non-argument. Maybe the point is to come off as being &quot;above&quot; the opposite camp (which are: mindless language bashers). But it&#x27;s about as intellectually stimulating as mindless language bashing: it doesn&#x27;t take much intellectual curiosity or rigour to bash a language, and neither does being perfectly neutral and non-offensive by throwing around platitudes like &quot;no language is perfect&quot;, &quot;choose the right tool for the job&quot;, etc.",1406768397

I think walking might burn more.<p>I remember reading a LOOONG time ago, that a person will burn a lot more if their metro stop is Lamarck-Caulaincourt than they will if their metro stop is Odeon.

I mean, it <i>is</i> interesting, but the title isn&#x27;t really correct and also not justified by anything written in the full article.<p>I&#x27;m a fairly serious hobbyist photo-taker and while the Lytro appeals to my geeky experimental side it has some major issues for use in &quot;serious photography&quot;:<p>While being able to refocus the image is nice, no matter where you set focus the sharpness is pretty shitty relative to nice, sharp modern conventional sensor/lens combos.  The images I&#x27;ve seen from the Illum are better in this regard than the previous oddly shaped box camera Lytro released, but still quite a bit off of conventional digital cameras.<p>4 megapixels, while perfectly fine for web-based images (though with the acceleration in adoption of HighDPI displays, even this is changing), is seriously limiting if you intend to make prints much larger than a 4x6&quot;, especially if you also have to crop at all.<p>Also, while the Canon 70-200mm is ~$2500 as noted in the article, Tamron makes an f/2.8 70-200mm that is for all practical purposes just as good for $1,400 which is less than the price of the Lytro even if you add in the cost of a used older low-end APS-C DSLR body (and even an older low-end DSLRs will have many more megapixels and overall image quality at HighDPI or print sizes) to go with it.<p>I still find the Illum (and light-field photography in general) interesting from a tech perspective and and would probably buy one to fuck around with if they cost like $400, but in the price range the Lytro retails for I would recommend anyone &quot;serious&quot; about photography pick up the Sony A7 with the 28-70mm kit lens.  You won&#x27;t be able to refocus or perspective shift the images, but the images will be sooo much nicer and more flexible if you intend to print or display them at very high resolutions.<p>I really wish I could be more positive about the camera because I want to see where light-field photography ends up down the road if it is pursued, but the $1,600 price really puts it in an odd place where it is too much (for most of us) to buy as a toy  but too limited to buy as a serious piece of photography gear.",1406767506

If you set your thermostat to a constant 70, the heater works a little at a time throughout the day. If you drop it to 50 at night or in the middle of the day, the heater stops working, but then when the time comes to warm the house again, the heater has to work at full power for a long time to get the temp back up - thus losing a lot of your savings.&quot;<p><i>WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG WRONG</i><p>Heat losses are driven by two factors:<p>1. The temperature differential between the hot and cold sides.<p>2. The thermal conductivity (or exchange) between the hot and cold sides.<p>That&#x27;s straight out of Newton&#x27;s Law of Cooling / Fourier&#x27;s Law:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_heat_transfer#Newton.27s_law_of_cooling"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_heat_transfer#Newton...</a><p>If you&#x27;re running heat constantly, you&#x27;re maintaining a <i>constant</i> flow of heat from your interior to the exterior.  That is, you&#x27;re maintaining a high heat exchange rate to the exterior, and you&#x27;re constantly wasting a large portion of heat.<p>If you&#x27;re heating only while you need a warm interior, then as the interior temperature falls, the energy flux to the exterior decreases.  You&#x27;re no longer pumping heat into the external environment.<p>Yes, you&#x27;ll run your furnace/heating system continuously for a while in raising the interior temperature, <i>but that is largely adding heat to the interior space, not to the exterior</i>.<p>The net is expending <i>less</i> energy.<p>Your <i>most efficient</i> strategy is to turn interior heat down to the minimum essential level (ultimately:  enough to keep pipes from freezing), or the minimum level the thermostat allows (often ~50F in the US).  My own practice is generally to turn any heating system off entirely at night.<p>From a moisture management perspective, you also win as cold air has a lower <i>absolute</i> humidity, that is, the <i>quantity</i> of water it can hold is lower.  Heating cold humid air reduces the <i>relative</i> humidity, allowing walls and surfaces to dry out.<p>The overnight heat loss is also a very clear sign that Paul Wheaton is dealing with an exceptionally poorly insulated structure.  And a very poor grasp of thermodynamics.<p>The same principle holds for AC as well, though here you want to <i>increase</i> the temperature setting at which the AC comes on, or disable AC entirely while you&#x27;re out of the home.<p>A better way of thinking of this is to <i>minimize the energy input</i> (heating or cooling) when it&#x27;s not needed.<p>See:<p><a href=""http://www.uswitch.com/energy-saving/guides/heating-on-all-the-time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uswitch.com/energy-saving/guides/heating-on-all-t...</a><p><a href=""http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2970/does-turning-down-the-thermostat-at-night-save-energy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2970/does-turning-d...</a><p><a href=""http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/thermostats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/thermostats</a>",1406766572
