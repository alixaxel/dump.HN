8062654,comment,8059237,8059707,2,0,aeberbach,,,"You definitely had a bug. I shipped a single-threaded A* for 3GS and up with maps created from maps of approximately 500x500 locations.<p>It started out completely broken, storing waypoints in Core Data and was taking upwards of four minutes to calculate a path. Switching to prefetching Core Data paths brought it down to about 90 seconds, but that&#x27;s as far as it could go with so many Core Data faults firing.<p>What made it really fly was the change the underlying data to direct bitmap access on maps prepared from the source maps (shopping centre levels actually) and applying simple filters to generate monochrome maps where one color was walkable and another not. Then source and destination locations were obtained through the original Core Data coordinates and a quick search algorithm found the closest walkable point to both. The A* calculation took perhaps a second or two.<p>Not content with that we went further and drew more complicated maps with what amounted to train tracks, a network of walkable paths one pixel wide connecting every store to every store to narrow down the solution space. The result was instant A* pathfinding and it was a very neat feature in the app.<p>You can definitely do A* in Objective C - just get to know Instruments inside out and keep tuning. On a 5S I expect you could get away with a lot of inefficiency.",1405922141

It&#x27;s quite possible that the effect is negative, as claimed by taxpayers associations, but that it&#x27;s small, so the larger positive effect of the current tech boom dominates the total.<p>A good economist would try to hold more things constant to tease out whether the effect exists.  Maybe break down the job growth numbers by area of the state (not all areas are in a tech boom, but all would face the same state tax policy).  Or break it down by industry (have non-tech companies lost jobs?).  Or break it down by size of company (since the opponents claimed that small businesses would be particularly hard hit).",1405920304

Unless you&#x27;re already filthy rich, getting enough money to not work requires a particular skillset. Lets say you&#x27;re only moderately lucky and are exceedingly good, and that it takes you 5 years to get your fat stacks out of a company you put blood sweat and tears into. Disregarding that you statistically have a relatively small chance of that happening, you come out of the tunnel in 5 years, and what do you do with the rest of your life now? Well, all of your skillset is based around your business. You probably don&#x27;t have a ton of things that give your fulfillment outside of that business. So what do you do, start at square one? Learn how to play the bongos or just go out and search for the real meaning of life? Or do what you&#x27;ve trained your whole life to do, what has given you the most meaning so far? I say you&#x27;ll more likely become addicted to that feeling of mastery, and more than likely you&#x27;ll be on the board of another startup or whatever you like, because you felt a lot more fulfilled when you were disrupting the world than being a person who&#x27;s bad at playing bongos.",1405919695

Many people have asked for such syntax, but I am wary of adding more complexity to the Core Language. Ultimately, I believe that this should be handled on the range side instead of the element side. What Evolution/Core needs to do is to fix the problem with nested temporaries in range-for loops - the problem (affecting both C++11&#x27;s range-for and mine) is that range-for will keep temporary ranges alive if they&#x27;re the topmost thing returned, but not if you have &quot;const T& noop(const T&)&quot; and you try to loop over noop(return_temporary_range()). They&#x27;re aware of the problem, which is a start. If and when that&#x27;s fixed, then what you want can be handled through library tech: &quot;for (elem : as_const(range))&quot;.",1405919198

But honestly, event still, Deep Learning doesn&#x27;t seem to model many of the understood principles of the neocortex at all. I read a relatively recent paper by Andrew Ng [2] about Deep Learning optimized for GPU and though it resembles some of the hierarchical aspects of the neocortex, it doesn&#x27;t really go any further.<p>I recommend that, if you&#x27;re interested, you read the [3] CLA white paper for more details but the main difference I see is that the CLA tries to model the concept of storing as sparse distributed representations by modeling neocortical columns. The problem there is that even today, neuroscientists don&#x27;t agree on any one theory of its structure and function. And frankly the CLA&#x27;s theory neocortical columns seems to be the most sane. This is based on some of [4] Gerard Rinkus&#x27;s research on the functions of neocortical columns.<p>Basically, in my opinion, there is A LOT more neuroscience in HTM-CLA then there is in Deep Learning. And I&#x27;m pretty sure that Deep Learning will converge on much of the concepts put forth by the CLA. It really shouldn&#x27;t be seen as a competition in the first place I suppose, but the theories in AI and theoretical neuroscience are converging pretty fast already.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2013/05/neuro-artificial-intelligence/all/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2013/05/neuro-artificial-intelligence/a...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/~acoates/papers/CoatesHuvalWangWuNgCatanzaro_icml2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stanford.edu/~acoates/papers/CoatesHuvalWangWuNgC...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://numenta.org/resources/HTM_CorticalLearningAlgorithms.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://numenta.org/resources/HTM_CorticalLearningAlgorithms....</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://people.brandeis.edu/~grinkus/Analog_Devices_Lyric_Talk_Rinkus_Dec_14_2012.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.brandeis.edu/~grinkus/Analog_Devices_Lyric_Tal...</a>",1405918895
