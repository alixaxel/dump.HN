8089847,comment,8088842,8089658,4,0,gwern,,,"I wonder how much of this is that relatively simple techniques work very well on small amounts of data, and that more complex techniques don&#x27;t perform sufficiently better to justify baking them into a compression format?<p>That is, to some extent I subscribe to the compression-as-intelligence school of thought: compressors are tiny little AIs which try to predict regularities in the bitstreams they are given ( <a href=""http://prize.hutter1.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prize.hutter1.net/</a> <a href=""http://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mattmahoney.net/dc/dce.html</a> <a href=""http://www.danburfoot.net/research.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danburfoot.net/research.html</a> ).<p>But when we look at the state of the art like ZPAQ, the AI techniques used don&#x27;t seem to be much more complex than, say, a one or two layer neural network which might as well be from the 1970s. You don&#x27;t see anything fancy like deep networks or other modern staples like random forests.<p>So this makes me wonder: maybe compression performance has stagnated because we&#x27;re not willing to provide compression algorithms extremely large amounts of data or runtime, and so simple algorithms really do perform best with the minimal resources we&#x27;re willing to use for compression. (People are happy to run neural networks on thousands of GPUs with many gigabytes of data and wait weeks for training to finish; can you imagine a compression utility which required that?)",1406386533

The _vehicle&#x27;s owner_ gets a fine in the mail shortly after.<p>There, fixed that for you.  Now, I&#x27;ll admit, a large part of the time the owner is also the driver, but with speed cameras it is not the &quot;driver&quot; who receives the fine, but the _owner of the vehicle_.<p>The one difference with &quot;speed cameras&quot; and the NSA&#x27;s data mining is that measurement of the rate of travel of a vehicle (assuming a properly calibrated and non-malfunctioning speed measurement device) is so close to 100% accurate as to be considered 100% accurate.<p>No &quot;connect the dots, infer here, infer there&quot; data mining in the NSA&#x27;s dataset will ever be even within several orders of magnitude of accurate as compared to a properly functioning, properly calibrated, speed measurement device.<p>And that underlying, non zero, error rate is what triggers the base rate fallacy issue in statistical analysis.  When an occurrence of X is extremely rare in a very large population without X, then the test for X has to be impossibly accurate for the results to not be swamped by false positives.  And this is a completely counter intuitive result, which is why it is so often overlooked.<p>Pertinent quote from the Shiner article at <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/03/data_mining_for.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/03/data_mining_f...</a>:<p>&quot;Let&#x27;s look at some numbers. We&#x27;ll be optimistic. We&#x27;ll assume the system has a 1 in 100 false positive rate (99% accurate), and a 1 in 1,000 false negative rate (99.9% accurate).<p>Assume one trillion possible indicators to sift through: that&#x27;s about ten events -- e-mails, phone calls, purchases, web surfings, whatever -- per person in the U.S. per day. Also assume that 10 of them are actually terrorists plotting.<p>This unrealistically-accurate system will generate one billion false alarms for every real terrorist plot it uncovers. Every day of every year, the police will have to investigate 27 million potential plots in order to find the one real terrorist plot per month. Raise that false-positive accuracy to an absurd 99.9999% and you&#x27;re still chasing 2,750 false alarms per day -- but that will inevitably raise your false negatives, and you&#x27;re going to miss some of those ten real plots.<p>This isn&#x27;t anything new. In statistics, it&#x27;s called the &quot;base rate fallacy,&quot; and it applies in other domains as well. For example, even highly accurate medical tests are useless as diagnostic tools if the incidence of the disease is rare in the general population. Terrorist attacks are also rare, any &quot;test&quot; is going to result in an endless stream of false alarms.&quot;",1406386308

This is a problem for them overseas because the brand-names often differ from country to country while the chemical name remains the same. Many people in the US often don&#x27;t even realise that Tylenol is the same thing as Panadol or acetaminophen.

Sitting adjacent to it was the generic Tylenol store brand.  Exact same physical size container.  Twenty five cents less price as marked on the shelf.<p>Looking more closely, the identical physical size container of generic contained 50 tablets (of identical tablet size to the 100 tablet name brand Tylenol).<p>The end result, due to the price mis-match, is that the name brand was actually nearly half the cost of the generic (because one got 2x the pills for 25 additional cents).<p>I&#x27;ve noticed this effect in grocery stores as well.  Often the lowest unit cost item is the middle of three sizes.  The small container is larger unit cost because the packaging contributes a larger percentage of the total price.  The large &quot;bulk&quot; container (which should be lowest unit cost) often is not.  The only valid reason I have deduced for why is the stores trying to take advantage of people who &quot;grab the bulk size because it&#x27;s cheaper&quot; without actually looking at the true costs.",1406384823
8089789,comment,8089321,8089509,26,0,nabla9,,,"I&#x27;m really baffled about this. Maybe I&#x27;m from older hacker generation (and I&#x27;m also a Finn). I just did not see  personal insults  going on. I would like to see more neutral discussion about cultural differences (between hackers and nations) and not  opinions and own cultural biases stated as normative.<p>Here is my personal cultural bias:<p>1. Insulting people personally is not same thing as insulting their ideas or their actions. If someone insults my actions or my ideas, I may get emotional, but I don&#x27;t take it as an insult. For me it means that I&#x27;m being challenged.<p>2. Cursing is not unprofessional or insulting in itself. Cursing is to be used for emphasis and to get people involved emotionally (good thing). Cursing has its place to signal frustration and get trough people.  Too much cursing is like underlining everything.<p>3. (Anglo American) business culture is not necessarily something to be emulated. Being overly polite invites all kinds of side stepping, passive aggressive behavior and ineffectiveness. I feel that &quot;being professional&quot; is used here as thought terminating cliche.<p>4. Some hacker cultures can be both fiercely competitive and cooperative at the same time. Being heavily criticized and challenged is part of that process. Kernel hackers compete to get their ideas incorporated into the same codebase. Javascript hackers borrow snippets from each other and do their own things (no need to be as competitive as forking is easier). This might lead to different hacker cultures. What is accepted in one culture is not accepted in other.<p>5. Management by perkele[1] is management strategy that can be very effective with the &#x27;Shut Up and Show Them the Code&#x27; hacker culture.<p>6. Pacabel may have a point. Younger generations may no be used to their work or behavior being harshly criticized and take it as personal insult.    <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8089706"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8089706</a><p>[1]:  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_perkele#Examples_in_free_software_culture"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_perkele#Examples...</a>",1406384796
