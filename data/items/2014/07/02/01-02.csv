It wouldn&#x27;t be hard to sell someone on hooking up with a fictional 18  year old, then delivering a 17 year old who clearly isn&#x27;t the person from the ad.  Personally I avoided these ads, but only because I learned through trial and error that meeting sex workers with reviews was usually a better value.",1404266350

If you have Classical with Gregorian as a sub-genre that&#x27;s the same thing as having Gregorian as a top-level genre.  Same with OP&#x27;s problem with &quot;World Music&quot; genre (except for the culturally insulting aspect of it).<p>The only time it could possibly matter is if the system doesn&#x27;t have sub-genres... but that would be a pretty ridiculous system.<p>Really genres suck for a different reason, because they are vague and overlapping and subjective.  What I want is a composable classification system with actual objective traits about the music... so I can say &quot;female lead singer, german language, trumpets, beats-per-minute 80-120&quot; and so forth.  I don&#x27;t know if such music exists, but I would listen to it if I could find it.<p>edit: didn&#x27;t realize the Songza doesn&#x27;t have any sub-genres of Classical, so include it as a &quot;pretty ridiculous system&quot;.",1404266009

When you access Tor, you&#x27;re masking your origin IP to the remote address by trusting one of a couple hundred volunteer exit nodes who raised their hands and said &quot;Trust me!  You can route all of your internet traffic through me and I promise I won&#x27;t monitor or inject anything...&quot;<p>I think most Tor users don&#x27;t have an adequate understanding of the threat model.  It doesn&#x27;t help that the Tor Project has at times upsold the anonymity provided to a ludicrous extent[1] (to be fair, they do address the risk in their FAQ[2]).  Is it more likely that that Comcast will MITM me, or some random exit node?  I might expect Comcast to maybe inject an ad into an HTTP connection or do some DNS redirect to shoot me an advertisement, but I don&#x27;t worry about them stealing my credit card or injecting a buffer overflow or something.  In fact, they have a profit incentive to not do so.  I don&#x27;t have that guarantee with a random exit node.  It might be a generous privacy advocate, or it might be someone who has more nefarious profit incentive in mind[3].  If you&#x27;re only connecting through Tor just to avoid the NSA, then you have to assume that both a) the NSA is targeting you to begin with, and b) that exit node you&#x27;re going through isn&#x27;t controlled by the NSA (or GCHQ/FSB/PLA/etc).<p>sslstrip[4] undermines the prospect of protecting yourself by connecting solely over SSL through Tor.  Even then, in my experience more than half of the sites I visit don&#x27;t support SSL to begin with.  The HTTPS Everywhere plugin that EFF provides and is included in the Tor Browser Bundle is implemented backwards - it connects over SSL only when the site matches a whitelist[5] (I use KB SSL Enforcer on Chrome myself).<p>Sorry if this came off as a rant - I just see too many articles like this that prop up Tor as a silver bullet without discussing the risks and establishing an adequate threat model that allows the user to make an informed decision regarding the risks/benefits of using Tor.<p>[1] <a href=""http://betaboston.com/news/2014/05/07/as-domestic-abuse-goes-digital-shelters-turn-to-counter-surveillance-with-tor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://betaboston.com/news/2014/05/07/as-domestic-abuse-goes...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#AttacksOnOnionRouting"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#AttacksOnOnionRo...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://threatpost.com/small-number-of-malicious-tor-exit-relays-snooping-on-traffic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://threatpost.com/small-number-of-malicious-tor-exit-rel...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibF36Yyeehw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibF36Yyeehw</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/faq</a>",1404265895

7974659,comment,7973833,7974440,1,0,mpdehaan2,,,"While I disagree with the premise of the blog post above and companies should be able to decide how to run themselves, I will say Ansible was one of the top 5 projects for most OSS contributors on GitHub last year (up there with Rails, Angular.js, and Homebrew).  We have over 775 total contributors now.<p>I think the greatest benefit of contributors is how to learn from them, creating a fantastic commons of learning, and they also keep things really well polished.  Ansible was built to build this commons out, and we have some 235+ modules in core because of this now, collectively maintained.<p>But there are also some things that community engineering has a hard time building, and that&#x27;s ok.  This model doesn&#x27;t work for all things, and employing a lot of really sharp people and giving away code is totally great too.  Distributed systems can be one of those things.  Crypto can be one of those things.  These are things that don&#x27;t need as large of teams as &quot;make this systems component work on every version of Linux/Unix/Windows/other&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think there should be a sense of entitlement towards everything being 100% democratic - it&#x27;s not appropriate everywhere - but when you can make it work, it can be a good thing.  In cases where the code is still open, but it&#x27;s a little harder to contribute to, it&#x27;s still open and you can learn from those sources and patch them when you need to.  Editorial inputs are still important.  Having a larger vision is critically important.<p>When those forces and needs can be balanced, great!  OSS is about itch scratching, so sometimes if you want to build something when others have different itches (or customers do), you do have to just go out and direct some folks to build it.  And that direction may be different than a whole armada of people may want to go, but can still get you to very interesting destinations.<p>For us, I think it&#x27;s about alternating between those two modes - enabling the stream of &quot;everything&quot; to come in from GitHub (but filtering it, reviewing it, and making it better), but also remembering where we might like to go, and pointing that way, and building some of those bridges to make colonization of new areas possible.",1404265782

Lately I have been heavily involved in cloud computing (Google Cloud and AWS - the actual platform services, not just IaaS), graph databases (Titan, less experience with neo4j), ElasticSearch, various ML and CV tools, and Apache Spark.

I am a designer. I work with my clients to understand the spirit of what they&#x27;re trying to accomplish. I don&#x27;t expect requirements, wireframes, or drawn out conference calls with stakeholders. The design process is an iterative one - and often you don&#x27;t know what it is you&#x27;re designing until you&#x27;re 3/4 done designing it :-)<p>The best projects for me are those that I can approach from an end-to-end standpoint. I do not believe you can separate the creative process of design with the technical process of systems analysis and architecture - they are one - managing them separately or in silos spells disaster.

You can be as involved as you want to be. Most of my work is done nailing the user experience. Too many products are solving really important problems yet stumble on UX - and in 2014, that spells instant death. I anticipate user needs - I don&#x27;t rely on them to email it in via a feedback form. I&#x27;m a firm believer in the fact that users don&#x27;t know what they want until they see it - and often it is a mistake to incorporate things like user feedback surveys too early in the process.<p>I&#x27;m opinionated. You can tell from reading this. I take my work very seriously and hold myself to seemingly impossible quality standards.

More specifically, conditional cash transfers or CCTs and governments spend more than $50 bn a year on this (depending on the definition, this can go up to $400bn a year!)<p>2. It would make sense for a lot of nonprofits to NOT EXIST in their current forms and instead be there to identify individuals and give them cash. If philanthropy was treated as a science with the objective of finding a method to maximize impact per dollar, there are good arguments to say that the null should be cash transfers for many cases. It&#x27;s sad that that&#x27;s not at all the case, especially for organizations funded by small private donors.<p>3. There are very few organizations/nonprofits/NGOs that do cash transfers in a way that you can reasonably know that almost all of your money is going to the poor: GiveDirectly and New Incentives.<p>GiveDirectly gives unconditional cash transfers (no strings attached) to people in need. New Incentives gives conditional cash transfers (based on fulfilling pre-defined health goals) to poor pregnant women with HIV.<p>4. The biggest issue with giving cash to the poor is to make sure that most of it goes to the poor instead of spending on either verifying these transfers, or transferring the cash to the beneficiaries. This may sound easy but since cash is so liquid, it has a tendency of getting &quot;lost&quot; with very little of it actually making it the beneficiary.<p>Very often people argue that poor people are poor because they don&#x27;t know how to manage money and that they will do the same with the money you give them. Maybe they will, most likely they won&#x27;t. They will likely use it in a way that benefits their life the most - to fulfill their greatest needs - which very often is food, shelter, and clothing. Still, if that&#x27;s your only argument, than it should make sense to give to the very poor in developing countries who have likely not had the chance to escape the rigid cycle of poverty.<p>--<p>If you think this article has merit beyond just being a great read, I would encourage you to donate to organizations doing cash transfers: www.newincentives.org www.givedirectly.com",1404263822
