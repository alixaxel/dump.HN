It refers to a society in which the government, which may be democratically elected, has a limited range of powers and can only pursue certain ends. In such a society, the majority cannot vote to pursue a particular end if it is outside the proper scope of government.<p>The framers did not implement &quot;limited government&quot; in the U.S. They created <i>a</i> limited government, the federal government, but only against the backdrop of the un-limited state governments. In the U.S., the &quot;government&quot; (between the state governments and the federal government), can pursue nearly any end that voters might wish to pursue. It is, together, limited only in scope by certain Constitutional rights. The limited nature of the federal government is just a tool to divide power between the state and federal levels.",1404327579
7978919,comment,7977836,7978060,6,0,yojimbo311,,,"I&#x27;m pretty sure we&#x27;ve already seen cases that prove that it doesn&#x27;t, perhaps not enough to write a blog post about, but they are definitely out there (iOS 7&#x27;s dramatic increase in the use of motion comes immediately to mind). I think it&#x27;s a dangerous sentiment to promote in such a generalized sense and designers/developers need to be very cognizant of the value any animation provides to the UX. It&#x27;s far too easy to justify the abuse/overuse of motion/animation, making any animation noticeable to &quot;delight&quot;/&quot;tell a story&quot; which contradicts any functional reason for implementing it.<p>I found the post overall to be pretty superficial. There was only one paragraph spent on describing the function/purpose of &quot;motion design&quot; and it placed far more emphasis on it&#x27;s more marketable aspects than on it&#x27;s utility to &quot;educate your users about how to interact with particular elements&quot;.<p>&quot;Motion design&quot; is just one UI tool and one that really didn&#x27;t need to be pulled out and promoted in this way IMHO as it&#x27;s always been an essential tool in great software when used properly. I think it would have been great if it wasn&#x27;t an &quot;implicit announcement&quot; but explored in detail what good &quot;motion design&quot; entails. It&#x27;s easy to get carried away with it, and introducing motion with appropriate intent can be what makes an otherwise good application into a great one, but let&#x27;s not pretend it&#x27;s magic dust that can turn cole to diamonds.",1404327575

You said <i>Increasing overall production doesn&#x27;t necessarily do anything for the lot of the median person.</i><p>Prove it. Provide sources. This is contradictory to the past 100 years of civilization.<p>2. You said <i>In a democracy, where the interests of the majority are paramount, a policy that reduces overall production but leaves the median person better off could be rational.</i><p>Have you ever heard of &quot;Tyranny of the Majority&quot;? What if the majority wanted slavery? Would you still agree with your argument? We don&#x27;t live in a democracy in the US--it&#x27;s a simple way to communicate public participation in society, which is needed. You seem to be mixing stats and political metaphors with no coherent point.<p>Finally, I&#x27;m confused with your last assertion that <i>policy that reduces overall production but leaves the median person better off could be rational</i>. How is that rational? Then again, humans aren&#x27;t rational so maybe I&#x27;m mistaken.",1404327550

At this point, I just resigned my full-time job and have enough cash on hand to maintain my current lifestyle for the next 10+ years before even thinking about finding a new job or withdrawing funds from my retirement accounts.<p>> How did you do it?<p>I worked in IT at a community bank and built a reputation for software development. After ~5 years there, I started a consulting business on the side to develop websites and custom software. The CFO at the bank introduced me to a client that was growing fast and wanted to build their own software to eliminate their growth bottlenecks. By focusing on their business needs, I was awarded 2 contracts over 2 large firms and an independent developer that bid on the work.<p>>How old are you?<p>I was 24 when I started working at the bank, 29 when I started the business. I&#x27;m turning 31 at the end of this month.<p>> What was it specifically that made the cash that ended up in your pocket?<p>One of the contracts I mentioned above was to build and host a project management tool. I priced this hourly since I could see the potential for this to become a long-term project. Once the software was up and running, I packaged a hosting and support service together which effectively works as a perpetual 4-figure per month retainer.<p>The client thought this project would be done in 3 months but I was able to show them the software had much more potential than they expected. Yesterday marked the start of the 2nd year of development with a rate increase of 25% on development work.<p>All this was accomplished part-time and put over $160k into my pocket in the last year. I&#x27;ve used some of the money for real estate investments which have pushed my zero-effort monthly recurring revenue up to $3500 after expenses.<p>The client is now interested in selling the software, and since I carefully positioned myself as the provider of hosting and development services, they&#x27;re open to a revenue share. If this works out then I&#x27;ll officially be &quot;never have to work again rich&quot;<p>>Do you feel happy in your life?<p>Yes! But the money didn&#x27;t make me happy.

I guess the emerging subtext here is: are you happier once you win the lottery?<p>Maybe you are interested in some contrast from academia?<p>I managed to become the academic equivalent of &quot;never have to work again rich&quot;, namely, I got a tenured-for-life can&#x27;t-fire-me professorship at a major university. This is the equivalent of winning the lottery for academics: we get to work on what we want and we get paid for it!<p>I literally do not have to go to work if I do not want to. I only have to teach a couple of hours a week, and I can get a graduate student to do that for me if it annoyed me (which it doesn&#x27;t; I derive a great sense of satisfaction and fulfilment from teaching).<p>> How did you do it?<p>Working hard, naturally, but not sooo hard. Say 40 hours a week. But probably I am thinking about science all the time, so it&#x27;s kind of hard to evaluate. But I also did it through <i>politics</i>: knowing the right people, talking to the right people, learning the system, identifying trends, jumping on the right scientific bandwagons, publishing incremental results in trendy journals, and winning large public grants (so far over US$2 million).<p>> What did it feel like when you first realised it was going \n> to be true that you would never have to work again if you\n> didn&#x27;t want to?<p>I reinterpret this as &quot;What did it feel like when you first realised that the need to ever look for a job again was gone?&quot;<p>The answer is it took me a long time to realise: being a professor is much like being a postdoc, with some extra admin thrown in. So it took me a long time to really accept the amazing luck I have. I&#x27;m still coming to terms with it (5 years later). It gets better every day.<p>> How old were you?<p>Tenured at 28, full professor at 31.<p>> Do you feel happy in your life?<p>Now yes. But not because of the job. Another commenter (diego) noted that &quot;We all age, get sick, have family / relationship problems, need to stay motivated.&quot; I completely agree.<p>Happiness has come to me not because of the job, but because I finally understood the value of family and relationships -- personally I derive much more happiness from my children, my wife, and the people around me than I do from science (although I do dearly love science).<p>For various reasons I know lots of very wealthy people who need never work again.

It should be filtering out the sex workers from the human trafficking victims, because the latter are the only actual victims in this business.<p>Have you ever considered that the opponents of legalized prostitution want it this way?  They want prostitution to be conflated with human trafficking, rape, and violence against women because nobody is for those things.

That is a technical accurate but very dry way to describe a construct that simply calls the function it&#x27;s given for every element in a collection and returns the accumulation of the results. Granted you can dive into all sorts of discussions about what that _really_ means and what power it gives you, but save that for much later, it isn&#x27;t introductory material.<p>An analogy to how functional programming often is taught would be if I tried to teach a new programming language by going over the BNF grammar first without context instead of starting with how the language is actually used in practice.

From the absurd, such as moving money from inefficient areas of the economy (i.e. <i>taxation</i> to efficient areas of the economy, private individuals, or from banks to small businesses.)<p>If there is a legal way for example for an employee that pays $10,000 in tax to employ someone at $10,000 and save that money then for each tax-payer a new job is being created. This can be for example be channeled via a non-profit (which scales via software) which would legally employ the individuals assign tasks to the individuals, provide training (which can employ trainers) help in seed money etc., basic health care and other similar services.<p>Another counter-intuitive idea, is to target high worth individuals, rather than low end individuals.

Pure Common Lisp (no macros), does not have any iteration constructs (besides goto). On top of these basic primitives you could build something much more complicated such as the &#x27;loop&#x27; macro, a DSL for describing iteration. Here is the second problem on project euler (sum of even Fibonacci numbers up to 4,000,000) solved using loop.<p><pre><code>  (loop for n   = 1 then (+ n n-1)\n        and n-1 = 0 then n\n\n        while (<= n 4000000)\n\n        if (evenp n) ; predicates in CL end in &#x27;p&#x27;\n          sum n)\n</code></pre>\nYou can add almost any (AFAIK any) paradigm you want. Initially Lisp did not have any object system. When OOP became a thing it was added to Lisp. Today it exists in the form of CLOS, a very powerful object system which at its core is two macros, defclass[0] and defmethod[1]. Logic programming can also be added through the use of macros[2]. Here is an example of append written using logic programming in Lisp (compare it to the Prolog version).<p><pre><code>  (<- (append nil ?xs ?xs))\n  (<- (append (?x . ?xs) ?ys (?x . ?zs))\n      (append ?xs ?ys ?zs)\n</code></pre>\nThe thing is you can make Lisp any language you want it to be.

I think you called me on a certain case, but an example like this demonstrates that they are not so &quot;very different&quot;:<p><pre><code>    def a(b):\n        m = 0\n        return b(m)\n</code></pre>\nOr even:<p><pre><code>    def a(b):\n        m = b(1)\n        return m+7\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t see how these are not a form of function composition. I&#x27;m definitely no expert. But I&#x27;d really appreciate an elaboration so I can learn from any mistake I&#x27;m making.",1404324136
