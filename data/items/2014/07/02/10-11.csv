7976195,comment,7976028,7976028,9,0,cyphunk,,,"It sounds evil but balkanisation of the Internet is a natural result of the erosion of trust in corporations and other stewards of this medium. The NSA/GCHQ scandal only pushed it a little further. We all know that any great medium starts out as a bastion of understanding, sharing and common good until a bunch of trolls show up to ruin it all (ahem, reddit, ycombinator, digg, etc). Until that moment we enjoy all the freedoms that such a medium offers and we assume it is something of and unto itself, never to be destroyed. In the Internet&#x27;s case the trolls were capital coming to understand how to modify the Internet to extract wealth and governments looking for a competitive edge over others using the Internets structural flaws to obtain that edge.<p>The erosion in this case is more harmful to many people than trolls showing up to reddit. So I think it&#x27;s natural that people recede slightly from the idea a globalised common communal identity created by the Internet and look toward their national structures to protect them. As Snowden said in some QA &quot;Our founding fathers did not say that all [US persons] were created equal&quot;. Until the irony of that statement is not cleared up internationally and human rights are absolutely universal balkanisation of the Internet will come. Russia, despite being an odd democracy, is only jumping onto a boat that already sailed in Brazil and other locations.",1404298747

7976165,comment,7972220,7976128,1,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"> I wasn&#x27;t referring to external tooling, which I agree gains a lot from strong types (specifically because a load of programs have been forbidden, which makes their job tractable).<p>Careful. You also want to allow unsound choices in completion options, since the programmer could have made a mistake or is unaware of the more specific type needed to support some operation (especially if they are using code completion for discovery purposes). Sometimes the path between valid program A and valid program C is an invalid program B (think about editing code without the ability to create transient syntax errors...how horrible would that be!). Type theorists often get this wrong, because they are so focused on correctness :)<p>> When dependent types and proving correctness are mentioned, there is often an assumption that some magical ability is gained.<p>I thought magic was needed just to do the type checking. I don&#x27;t think anyone who has gone through the program proving process would think it was easier (e.g. via F*), a lot of sweat is required to get those rock solid absolute guarantees.<p>> As for &quot;reified types&quot; affecting run-time behaviour, I would call those tags rather than types. For example, the class of an object is a tag, not a type.<p>This is only the overly narrow type theorist&#x27;s definition of type. The class of an object is obviously a type/kind/classifier via the informal definition of type. In a statically typed language, it also happens to correspond 1-1 with the static type of the object as created, which is incredibly useful from a usability standpoint. Erasure likewise is pretty bad, and languages that don&#x27;t erase (C# vs. Java) are much more usable.",1404298113

But it adds a lot of complexity, too.  You need a way to declare values of this type - this means more keywords and/or more special syntax.  You need a way to then access both halves of the values, so now you have to add pattern matching... that&#x27;s actually a lot of complexity to add to a language that only has 25 keywords.<p>All that, instead of just doing what Go already does, which is to return two values and just have a convention of checking the error before the value... which works really well 99% of the time, and doesn&#x27;t require all the rest of that complexity.",1404297944
7976158,comment,7975436,7975768,5,0,sparkie,,,"> I&#x27;d like to read people treating languages and platforms as tools and not as cargo cults. You don&#x27;t read carpenters writing they&#x27;ll ditch hammers for screwdrivers because the old cupboard they are fixing uses nails. You read carpenters debating the pros and cons of using hammers versus screwdrivers. And you read better carpenters that debate how cupboards are designed, because it is ultimately more important than whether they are glued, nailed or screwed.<p>The problem with this carpenter analogy is that it simply doesn&#x27;t scale - a carpenter is not going to build a skyscraper. To build skyscrapers we need <i>engineering</i> - the practical application of science - something which is completely missing from our field. We call ourselves <i>software engineers</i>, but we&#x27;re really <i>software masons</i> - we can do good work in small quantities, but we&#x27;re terrible and building big structures - which is where many of our software problems lie.<p>You can&#x27;t build a house on some land, and later turn it into a skyscraper either - because the foundations are perhaps the most vital part of the structure - they need to be designed with some knowledge of the size, shape and mass of the structure they intend to support. The approach taken in software development is the tacking on of new systems - building structures equivalent to say, the Kowloon walled city (unsightly and unstable).<p>To do engineering and science, we need math - and we have no sound way of modeling imperative languages/programs in ways that makes them useful as mathematical concepts. FP <i>is</i> math - so building up concepts in these languages is providing a richer set of math objects and abstractions which we can later use to build our large structures. Using FP doesn&#x27;t mean we need to abandon imperative coding - it just means we should clearly mark the effects of such imperative chunks of code, so we can treat them mathematically.<p>Carpenters are still relevant in the construction of skyscrapers - but their responsibilities are only a small part of it - they&#x27;re given clearly defined boundaries of when and where they should be working. This is really how we should be doing software - we need engineers and architects to build structures, using science and math, then assigning isolated environments for the &quot;masons&quot; (e.g, junior programmers) to work in - in such a way that a mistake by a junior programmer cannot bring the entire skyscraper crashing down. (Turns out this was understood in the 70s, because Unix pipes and processes are still the best approach we have to this day).<p>Of course, this doesn&#x27;t mean it should be &quot;my Coq is better than your Twelf&quot; - we need to separate the math from the textual representations and even the execution models.",1404297921

I&#x27;ve been working as a consultant since 1995.  I have extensive experience with Ruby (and Rails), Python, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and many other technologies.  I just finished my PhD in Learning Sciences from Northwestern University, creating and researching the intersection between online communities, social networks, and agent-based models.<p>That said, my real value isn&#x27;t my extensive technological know-how.  Rather, it&#x27;s my ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical people, and to turn that communication into business value.<p>I know how to take business needs and turn them into software, by myself and with others.  I also know how to describe technical issues in terms that business people can understand, that allow us to make informed decisions.  Many of my clients have used me as a remote, part-time CTO or lead developer.<p>I also help developers and teams improve their coding and management practices.  I frequently teach in-person courses in Python, Ruby/Rails, PostgreSQL, and Git to such companies as Apple, Cisco, Freescale, HP, SANDisk, and VMWare.  I also offer online coaching/pairing services to individuals and teams.  I can be your &quot;personal coding trainer,&quot; setting goals and meeting several times each week to ensure that your code and coding improve.<p>My aim: Long-term, interesting projects with nice people.  (Short-term relationships can also be fine, depending on the work and myschedule.)  Bottom line, I like to speak with and help nice people, and feel privileged that my work lets me do so.  If I can incorporate elements of what I learned doing my PhD -- an online collaborative platform and social network for agent-based modelers (<a href=""http://modelingcommons.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://modelingcommons.org/</a>) -- then that would delight me even more.<p>If I can be of help to you or your company, contact me at reuven@lerner.co.il, or on Skype as &quot;reuvenlerner&quot;.

Then the US also has that weird rule that allows you to drive straight through a red light, as long as you are turning right, which has visitors staring in disbelief.<p>In the UK/Europe, green means go and red means stop, without the above exceptions. In order to make this work, pedestrian crossings are often segmented, with individual signals for each section. There are a few junctions where all traffic is stopped for pedestrians, but that is pretty rare. Most junctions just allow pedestrians to cross on sections where traffic is not travelling.<p>UK/Europe also has a lot fewer crossroads than US.

But in a well-designed language that&#x27;s actually fairly easy.<p>> The other point of the article is that dynamic typing makes code rot. I am not convinced that static languages do any better. Code rot is not a problem of the typing system, it&#x27;s a problem with the programmer writing the code, or the environment he&#x27;s in. Let&#x27;s see what happens when he inherits a 5-year-old Haskell codebase.<p>Having done both, it&#x27;s far easier to port an old statically-typed codebase to newer versions of its dependencies than to do the same for an old dynamically-typed codebase.

There was absolutely no suspense, everyone knew Loeb would win most of the rallies barring the winter courses.<p>As for Women&#x27;s football, there&#x27;s a reason it&#x27;s not really appreciated and that is the fact that the skill level is significantly lower. Far fewer women play, which results in less competition and less highly talented individuals. Another problem is that the goals are sized for men, while the women keepers statistically speaking are smaller and can cover a smaller area, which means it&#x27;s far easier to score with cheap shots. It all makes for rather dull spectating, sadly.",1404295641

Self-driving is something we can do to cut down on the fatality rate per car. Each of these is a partial solution. Partial solutions are complementary, not exclusive.",1404295635

There are fewer shortcuts that can lead to broken abstractions and hard to find errors.<p>On the other hand, with OO you are always just a few more lines of code away from shipping. It&#x27;s popular because it provides easy abstractions over data (rather than operations), but as we all know it causes unnecessary coupling and broken abstractions if you aren&#x27;t careful. Imperative programming (not just OO) presents a lot of problems for concurrency, which is perhaps the biggest problem in the coming decade.<p>OO can be done right, but when it is, it&#x27;s just as &quot;hard&quot; as FP. In fact, a lot of good OO code is functional in nature.<p>What is tempting about FP is that it will make programming hard enough that bad programs won&#x27;t ship. Is proponents of FP think that programming should be hard. That it should require a lot of thought up front, for every line of code.<p>In a good lang and framework, a complete program is a good program. This idea is likely not very welcome in an industry where deadlines are always more important than quality.",1404295531
