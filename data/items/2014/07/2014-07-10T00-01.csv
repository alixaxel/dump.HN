The first on is limited by attenuation on the cable. As you increase the frequency, the cable does a less good job of propagating the signal, and your signal level decreases at the other end. This is limited by power and cable quality. The efficiency of the encoding is limited by the sensitivity of the receiver and its internal noise along with external noise.<p>Depending on these parameters, power, bandwidth, and signal to noise, the bandwidth can be arbitrarily high (subject I suppose to quantum effects). See: <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon%E2%80%93Hartley_theor...</a><p>This system uses a bandwidth of 500 MHz over two pairs.

It is a very complete and uniform engine, and can be very useful for very different kinds of mathematics.<p>However, Wolfram Research deliberately keeps their methods and source code closed. Note that this is more serious than just the &quot;Stallman-esque&quot; open-source-everything philosophy. Wolfram insists that users do not need to know implementation details of their methods. This is plainly in their documentation. You can see the uncompelling argument from Wolfram here [6]. The gist of the argument is that interfaces matter, not implementations.<p>I strongly argue that users, especially mathematicians and engineers, should care about the internals of mathematical software, especially when it&#x27;s being used, even in a utilitarian fashion, for research and engineering.<p>Not only this, but Wolfram has litigated against his own employees for publishing mathematical proofs about cellular automata. Information about this lawsuit is sparse, but evidence of it can be seen in [0]. More information can be found here [1].<p>Unfortunately most responses to the above from users of Mathematica is &quot;well I just use Mathematica as a calculator, nothing serious&quot; or &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t look at the source code anyway, so what gives?&quot; It&#x27;s an unfortunate response, and I don&#x27;t have a technical rebuttal, but a moral one, which many don&#x27;t want to hear.<p>It pains me to see the technical reliance on Mathematica (and other software such as MATLAB) in professional mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. It reminds me of an addictive drug; one of the best hackers I know does their work completely in Mathematica, and can no longer work without it.<p>As is the case with a lot of closed source, proprietary software, there aren&#x27;t a ton of good alternatives. There is a plethora of logistical issues with existing computer algebra systems, but I nonetheless recommend them. Sage [2] is a continuously growing system based on Python which has backing from a lot of mathematicians. They are continually improving it. There&#x27;s also Maxima [3]. None of these has quite an extensive array of functionality and graphical capabilities as Mathematica.<p>I (and others) have written more about this issue more extensively here [4] for those interested. This is an extension on the article written by Jordi G. Hermoso [5].<p>If you took the time to read this, thanks.<p>[0] <a href=""https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/theory-edge/conversations/messages/5828"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/theory-edge/conversation...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/wolfram/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/wolfra...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sagemath.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sagemath.org/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://andrejv.github.io/wxmaxima/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andrejv.github.io/wxmaxima/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?p=69"" rel=""nofollow"">http://symbo1ics.com/blog/?p=69</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.symbo1ics.com/files/jordi.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.symbo1ics.com/files/jordi.pdf</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/WhyYouDoNotUsuallyNeedToKnowAboutInternals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/WhyYouDoNotUs...</a>",1404952068

If you get to redefine &quot;computer&quot; to exclude embedded systems, even though they vastly outnumber &quot;computers as computers&quot; (whatever that really means), then you get to be right.<p>Actually, I don&#x27;t think I disagreed with you, except to note that a research kernel that might be used someday, does not count as &quot;general use&quot;.<p>You might count the insinuation of overstatement as a disagreement. The point of that is that context matters. When I talk about choice of OS, the Mac in my living room has rather more weight in my mind than the embedded controller in my garage; I know I&#x27;m not alone in this.

Kind of sad though, I think there&#x27;s a huge opportunity in providing hyperlocal capabilities the way I described.<p>So let me check my understanding: what I&#x27;m seeing is that there are only two scenarios that make iBeacons useful:<p>* the mobile app has to have all possible beacon id&#x27;s hard coded (or configurable by the user) and mapped to desired responses. The tradeoff is that any growth in the iBeacon network necessarily requires an app update.<p>* the mobile app has to function like a dumb terminal, receive a ping, then query a separate server asking what&#x27;s special about that ping. This avoids updating the app, but adds a whole new point of failure to the system.<p>Thanks again for your response. very helpful.",1404950679

Some people think that there are too many NSA stories; others, too few. On any issue where the community is divided, upvotes compete with flags, and stories rise and fall according to the tug of war.<p>The HN software adds a small default weight to NSA stories. The purpose of this is obviously not to suppress them. If we were trying to do that, it would be a large weight and not a small one. Instead, it&#x27;s tuned so that NSA stories can still easily make the front page—and so they do. It&#x27;s an attempt to strike a balance between the different segments of the community who strongly disagree with one another about how much NSA is the right amount of NSA.<p>The story last night about Muslim leaders was not much affected by the software. If users hadn&#x27;t flagged it, it would certainly have stayed on the front page. In my view, users were right to flag it. I hope this site never sees another thread where a large class of fellow citizens are accused <i>en masse</i> of being fifth columnists and rapists. If we do, I trust that users will flag it again.<p>Some of you feel that such stories are so important that the flamewars around them should just be allowed to burn. Our experience and observation suggest the contrary: they are bad—existentially bad—for the site. Like fire in general, they lead to more of the same. So the alternative to the current policy is conflagration. The best aspects of HN, in our view, would not survive this.",1404950527
