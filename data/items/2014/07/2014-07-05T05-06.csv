As far as I remember, it was the old office of the Nazi local secret police and then the Communist local secret police. It is now a museum dedicated to what has been done by both regimes, and it has a really nice &quot;visual&quot; approach. Just as an example, the &quot;role switch&quot; of the secret police from Nazi to Communist (made most of the time by the same people), was well represented by a room full of lockers, with two dummies with the two corresponding different uniforms set on a rotating base and with memorabilia of the time including contract that was signed by Nazi secret police officer to vow that they have changed their mind and that now believed in the new regime.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.terrorhaza.hu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.terrorhaza.hu/</a>",1404539742

Looking around me, I saw the snow, trees, grass, buildings very differently than normal; they were all exactly alike. When looking at grass, it looked, literally, like the same texture pasted all over the field. Same for snow, trees, houses. So I sat down with my friend and started talking how the world must be built up of a much lower resolution substance than we think and our minds add randomness to make it seem as if it&#x27;s more diverse. Shrooms are great in that you remember everything of the trip and it is like you are awake and dreaming; I apparently am more susceptible to it than others; I actually see things which are not there which is more common with LSD. My friends usually saw only some vibrations on the wall and felt funny (and after that paranoid) while I was seeing the armada falling from the sky while hearing orchestra&#x27;s play. I would recommend anyone at least trying a few times; it changes things long term, but like others said, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll move to religious or something like that; if you&#x27;re scientific, it is more likely to explain things to totally eradicate that last sliver of paranormal stuff in the world.

The fact that it is culturally an easy option to move on, turns them into unsuitable marriage material. I would just be getting into an accident waiting to happen.<p>Prince Charles and lady Diana only divorced because it was culturally acceptable and rather easy to do.

However, in a day and age where (in the Western world, anyway) women no longer need men overtly for financial support, social recognition as mating currency is just that--social recognition.  It can be, and very often is, orthogonal to wealth. Witness all the young women in love with crappy DJs, self-styled pseudo-unemployed hipsters, no-name sidewalk band heroes, stoners, and a variety of Bohemians that a conservative dad would call losers or starving artists--er, artistes.<p>Financial and career success is definitely one way to up your mate value, though it has more resonance once women get out of their twenties. It&#x27;s not the only way. When you&#x27;re young, particularly, it may not even be the best way. Vide all the fairly intelligent guys with steady, well-paying jobs (very much so, by the standards of median American household income) that nobody pays attention to, really. The broke dudes that know how to put out their plumage and leverage some other, more conspicuous cultural archetype get much more play.<p>I&#x27;m not a washed-up, embittered MRA or PUA guy, btw.

7991097,comment,7990191,7990797,3,0,leif,,,"I can&#x27;t add much to what Chris and Zardosht already said, but let me reiterate a few things regarding our fork:<p>1. You&#x27;re a bit out of date.  We merged changes to catch up to 2.4 in about a month (once we decided 2.4.x was stable).  The current plan is the same for 2.6.  We&#x27;re currently working on it.  If you need the latest and greatest Mongo features, stick with basic MongoDB.  If you&#x27;re willing to suffer a bit of lag (on the order of months) to receive our benefits, we&#x27;re here if we can help.<p>2. Geo is a known issue.  At the moment it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s <i>that</i> widely used, so it&#x27;s not a very high priority.  However, we know some people want it and we will eventually get to it.  Hopefully with a better implementation.<p>3. MongoDB&#x27;s full-text search capabilities are, as far as I can tell, far behind what&#x27;s provided by the state of the art text search systems, and serious users currently use MongoDB/TokuMX in concert with more focused solutions like Solr/Lucene/Elastic Search.  I haven&#x27;t spoken to anyone invested in text search that actually used MongoDB&#x27;s text indexes, even if they use MongoDB elsewhere in their application.  If you do, I&#x27;d love to buy you lunch and talk about it, please email me (my username here at tokutek.com).<p>4. Here&#x27;s the big takeaway I got from last week&#x27;s conference: MongoDB has been convinced that many of the problems we solve with TokuMX (performance, compression, concurrency, transactions) are important to their biggest users.  Their most hyped announcements and plans for 2.8---document-level locking and the storage engine API---are aimed straight at us.  We see this as a <i>resounding validation</i> of our technology, and a wonderful challenge to continue improving TokuMX.  While it&#x27;s tantalizing to implement a fractal tree storage engine according to their API (and there&#x27;s no doubt that we will implement one), our innovations in TokuMX proper run deeper, into extra collection types, replication and sharding internals, and we have further plans for TokuMX that are beyond the scope of a storage engine API.  The availability of the API is an opportunity for us to create a product with some of our improvements (mainly insertion performance and compression) with better compatibility (esp. w.r.t. replication and geo/full-text) and a simpler upgrade path.  However, TokuMX as it exists as its own product (with better replication, sharding, and advanced features like clustering indexes and partitioned collections) is not going away, and will continue to see aggressive innovation as it will always lead a product built from MongoDB&#x27;s storage engine API in terms of advanced features like clustering indexes and shard-aware transactions.",1404537035

But more importantly, availability of public funding does not solve the problem of restricting political speech in any way. So imagine we put 1.5 bn of public spending in the campaign. What prevents the candidates from spending another 1.5 bn of private money? The private money spending is limited only by the amounts people are willing to spend to support their causes. Adding public money to that does not change it (unless you somehow conclude people would not be willing to donate anymore, but this is an unsupported assumption). So unless you prohibit people from spending money on political speech - I do not see how public funding changes the picture.",1404536621
