The bullet points make a couple of claims about what Patoline excels at, but still no code examples can be seen that could give me a feel for how Patoline actually works.<p>I had to go to &#x27;documentation&#x27; and click a small insignificant looking link to actually get to see an explanation of Patoline and some code examples... in a PDF file.<p>I understand that it&#x27;s cool to write the tool&#x27;s manual using the tool itself, but if I come to the website and want to evaluate quickly whether this is interesting and could replace LaTeX for me, I need a quick overview directly on the index page, together with some examples similar to the one on the wikipedia LaTeX page (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX#Examples"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX#Examples</a>).",1405159579

I need to add that your story seems to implicate you do not have a way to measure the efforts put into your code, quality assurance is one you can use and it&#x27;s quite well known.<p>In the teams I&#x27;ve been part of and managed, egos always tend to come into play when writing code: I got better ideas, I got better line indenting, blah blah... been there, done that.<p>I think it&#x27;s mostly important to focus on the outcome: practically speaking the way I would tackle this is by introducing some level of QA, either by introducing TDD or else. You start by writing tests as use case scenarios, and then implement the code. Once this is done, if any of your colleagues wants to re-implement the code/module/whatever, let them do it, but the tests need to pass and the improvement should be measurable. Otherwise who f*ing cares?<p>Peace!",1405159423

It can optimize your document in several ways, including reducing its size to fit the standards of a conference paper.<p>I guess this means you could use this to force a résumé to fit on one page!",1405159327
