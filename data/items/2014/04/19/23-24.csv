And what disparities there are between individuals and departments?<p>I&#x27;d bet that it&#x27;s overall _less_ time than companies where vacation is metered, but compulsory.  e.g. mine in the UK is 25 to 32 days depending on time at the company, plus bank holidays, and you&#x27;ve got to take it.<p>Peer pressure must conspire to _reduce_ what people take, especially in companies that do &quot;360 degree&quot; peer reviews.  And it would only take a hint of management pressure to make staff feel guilty about booking holidays (or cancelling those that they&#x27;d already booked).<p>For me &quot;unlimited holidays&quot; translates to &quot;unlimited work hours&quot;, and I&#x27;d be suspicious of companies that promote it as a perk.",1397951911

I suppose it depends what type of app you&#x27;re building as to whether those are worth anything to you -- but in the areas where F# is rapidly getting more popular (data science, numerical/algorithm-heavy work, distributed computing) they do in fact make you much more productive. A good chunk of that productivity gain results from being able to easily and quickly write type-safe code and express algorithms without a great deal of syntactic overhead.<p>A JavaScript developer might be more productive than either a C# or F# developer depending on what kind of app he/she was writing; overall I don&#x27;t think that would be the case, especially once you factor in maintenance costs of the code over the long-term.",1397951706

If you&#x27;re essentially doing a multi-round elimination test based on your custom keywords, you might be able to reduce your noise a bit by preprocessing the &#x27;phrase&#x27; stream with something like tf-idf (it looks like your working with the raw data right now?). Then you get a list of the keywords in the document, an estimate of how important they are to that document, and you know how important certain keywords are to you. With that info you can try to classify s.t. you admit jobs with a high intersection if keywords that are important to both of you.<p>I think something along the lines of a knn classifier be pretty efficient at doing that.

It&#x27;s not impossible to succeed, but there are a lot of ways to making it much harder -- one of this being choosing a niche language without a compelling reason to do so.<p>There is nothing wrong with F#, the language (even though I don&#x27;t particularly like its syntax), but clearly one has to account for the costs of reskilling the team on a new language, as well as a new paradigm, making a bet on a language with a still uncertain future (will it ever become a mainstream language?) and really non-existent tooling support.<p>Given that both C# and F# are general purpose, hybrid languages, I don&#x27;t see a compelling story -- in 2014 -- behind F# that makes it such as huge deal as its advocates make it.<p>The onus is on them to bring convincing evidence to the table that, once factored in the risks and the costs that arise from the shortcomings, the benefits are still a good bargain in the real world, and with real people, outside of the easy fake example one finds on blogs etc.",1397949573

You&#x27;re quite right about that.<p>Let&#x27;s say that you and I go in together for some startup.  Neither of us has the $50k in the bank to pitch in immediately so that we&#x27;re equal investors in the company as well as equal cofounders.  But let&#x27;s say that due to a book you published some time ago you&#x27;re bringing in $4k/mo in royalties which is enough to pay the bills.  And because I don&#x27;t have the option to go without a salary, we get some seed funding to the tune of $100k so we can pay me a small salary and afford whatever mundane things we need to get going.<p>I would argue that as long as we agree to both pay ourselves $4k/mo until things really get going, and you just happen to be able to pay yourself that $4k/mo for the next year out of your royalties that is a $48k (or perhaps a bit more due to interest) investment.  Sure it&#x27;s not all delivered at the time of the seed round but it&#x27;s all pledged by that time.  So long as you don&#x27;t start demanding a salary before the year is up (i.e. you make good on your investment) I think it makes sense for you to get some additional equity as a result.<p>If you disagree I&#x27;d really like to hear the particulars.  You&#x27;ve written before that one shouldn&#x27;t mix up the day-to-day with valuation, but if it&#x27;s a one-time thing at the beginning it seems more like an investment and less of an ongoing negotiation.",1397949471

While preserving digital photos is an inherently easier task than preserving negatives and prints — neither of which can be stored, duplicated, <i>or even viewed</i> without at least some amount of degradation — the skills and processes required are very different.<p>Professional archivists aren&#x27;t simply going to stick digital media in a climate-controlled vault and assume it&#x27;ll be accessible in 80 years, and, if you care about your photos,  neither should you!<p>Putting (perfectly tractable) media preservation issues aside, most common lossy and lossless image formats have open, published specs for both image data and metadata, so I wouldn&#x27;t anticipate problems reading these in the future — can you honestly imagine a non-apocalyptic future where JPEG, TIFF, or PNG files won&#x27;t be viewable in 80 years? Unprocessed, proprietary camera raw files pose more interesting problems, of course.",1397948534

You of course would need to be open-minded enough to understand that a C# developer doesn&#x27;t mean an imperative developer. I am not the best developer at all, but my C# code tends to be quite functional and I prefer using the Maybe monad to deal with nulls in some cases for example. I just don&#x27;t see any massive obvious benefit of loosing the tooling and ReSharper to switch to F#. Especially now that C# is open-source and the Roslyn is nearly there.<p>PS: a good JavaScript developer will probably be even more productive than both C# and F#, despite the language being horrible.",1397948516
