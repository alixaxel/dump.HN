Compared to the iPhone 1 a top-of-the-line PocketPC phone was clearly a CNC Machine. In 2005 I used my PocketPC Phone to SSH into Unix Boxes, write long emails with its slide out keyboard, edited pictures and let people sign documents with its pen and used GPS for turn by turn navigation.<p>In 2007 Apple released a phone that could only run web-apps without hardware support. At the time this got a big meh from me since it looked like a toy compared to my phone.",1396425564

If you are married (or in a civil union or domestic partnership or whatever separate-but-equal code word people want to use to grant gay people almost-but-not-equal rights), you engage in mutual care for one another. You look after each other when sick, you cover for each other&#x27;s temporary financial shortcomings (when they lose a job for instance). You provide a whole lot of care that if you weren&#x27;t together would be something that society would have to provide, especially in older age.<p>Take my paternal grandparents. When my grandmother was still alive, the two of them happily lived together and cared for one another even though my grandfather was at that point experiencing the early onset of dementia.<p>When she died, my grandfather had to go into residential care, paid for partly by their pension, partly by my parents and uncles, and partly through the subsidy that the state provide for elderly people going into care homes.<p>The more people who are able to live together in a mutually caring relationship like a long-term marriage, the less people need to go into care homes meaning the less subsidy needs to go into that kind of care for the elderly.<p>Marriage has a societal benefit in promoting that kind of mutual care, regardless of the gender of the partners and regardless of whether you have kids (and, hell, same-sex couples can and do have kids, so that&#x27;s a shit argument anyway).<p>Could you set up another system to provide that kind of benefit? Sure. But this is the system we have and it should be available to long-term gay couples as it is for straight couples.",1396424852

The AST is more an accident of how we compile, but syntax is still invalid if you fail to match types, which are context sensitive; all of the calls (and thus most of the meaning of a function) refers to these tables as well, and many nodes can share the same &quot;semantics&quot; subnode; and by far the most important part to us as while programming is the data flow, which is structured as an often cyclic directed graph. Really, the tree does not buy us much of anything in this case: modern editors tend to allow syntax aware edits and refactoring anyways, and coding structure dictates that your code &quot;look&quot; like the AST anyways with blocks and spacing and such.<p>Similarly, proofs are only treelike at a very small depth before becoming directed graphs, and most modern data stores like XML and JSON which form trees tend to have additional logical (if not formal) schemas that add complexity to the problem.",1396424181

For an in-memory data structure, the same property yields a performance boost by keeping cache-line misses to a minimum. C++ B-tree containers make better use of the cache by performing multiple key-comparisons per node when searching the tree. Although B-tree algorithms are more complex, compared with the Red-Black tree algorithms, the improvement in cache behavior may account for a significant speedup in accessing large containers.&quot;",1396423749

We do, however, expect the following:\n- You live and die by good abstractions. You know that they can make the difference between easily understandable and maintainable code, and a spaghetti mess. - You think about edge cases and performance implications, and anticipate future needs. - You read and understand existing code before diving in and adding your own. You re-use existing code whenever possible, cleaning it up as needed to be more generally useful. - You know when to do it fast, when to do it right, and how to find the best compromise between the two. - You recognize that we are all stewards of the codebase, not owners. You leave code better than you found it, and you fix bugs without grumbling about whose they are. - You are a team player who enjoys discussing ideas and implementations with other engineers.\nHere’s a small sampling of the things you will be working on as a member of the Prismatic backend team:\n- Making our crawlers and document analysis better and more comprehensive - Building out new product features in our API - Solving tough systems problems to help us scale reliably and robustly - Building and improving Machine Learning systems for ranking, document analysis, and more - Creating tools to assist development and ops - Shipping some of the best open-source Clojure libraries out there, and working with the community to make them better<p>We are also looking for designers, visual and/or interaction.",1396423109

I can&#x27;t have packets getting lost in the middle of an SSH session: it just doesn&#x27;t make sense. My keystrokes are a stream of data that must be in order, and must be delivered: thus TCP.<p>I commute daily, and use 4G on my commute. Another poster has problems very similar to mine[1]:<p>> As an aside, these days it&#x27;s worth noting that a 3G, WLAN or 4G link layer will try very hard not to drop any packets. So when you&#x27;re doing UDP, watch out for those 40000 millisecond old packets that will burst to your lap once the rain cloud moves away from the cell tower<p>You can see this just by pinging 8.8.8.8 in the background. The loss of good signal will result in many packets getting dropped, but then when signal resumes, ping will receive the packets that it had presumed lost, and you&#x27;ll get things like:<p><pre><code>  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=65 ttl=46 time=37324.3 ms\n  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=66 ttl=46 time=36324.3 ms\n  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=67 ttl=46 time=35324.3 ms\n  64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=68 ttl=46 time=34324.3 ms\n  ... and so on ...\n</code></pre>\nFrom which you can tell that they were buffered somewhere, and then when the signal cleared up, basically transmitted quickly and cleanly. But it makes you wonder if TCP connections then receive a flood of duplicate packets (the original + the resends); I&#x27;ve not watched wireshark closely enough to see.<p>For all the ads make you think speed is the determining factor in who has the better 4G, I&#x27;d say simple packet loss or connectivity loss makes much more of a difference to me day-to-day. &quot;Coverage&quot;, you might call it, except typically according to the phone there is a signal, it is 4G, but the strength is just so poor as to be unusable. I use an app to get this info (the bars in the corner just aren&#x27;t fine-grained enough), and it reports things like &quot;Net. type: NSDPA * 7.2 Mbps&quot;, and that&#x27;d be okay, except: &quot;Net strength:  -99 dBm * 7 ASU&quot; — too low for connectivity; in my experience, I require >-80 dBm for actual data to transmit successfully.

So I hear where you&#x27;re coming from.<p>Congrats on your accomplishments.  None of the following is meant to lessen them.<p>When I was young and impressionable, it struck me as absolutely freaking magic that you could make whole <i>hundreds</i> of dollars appear out of the Internet without doing &quot;real work&quot; with an office and tie and deadlines and all those things that sounded a lot like my least favorite parts of school.  Being older and wiser, I now realize that hundreds of dollars is rat spit next to the going market rates for engineers, and there exist plenty of options to get compensated in 2014 for things which are much closer to LoL than they are to office/tie/TPS reports.<p>I also hear you with regards to the social issues.  I lost a lot of friends, including some of the people who probably knew me best, when I quit playing WoW.  We made the usual non-specific promises for hanging out later.  It never happened.  I eventually made new friends, some on the Internet (<i>waves</i>) and some off.<p>I&#x27;d suggest simply titrating down on your LoL play per week (cap it to, say, 12 hours a week to start [+]) while you start getting ready for Adulthood (TM).<p>Also, although it&#x27;s sort of tangential to the LoL issue, you may not be accurately apprised of the current state of the hiring market for engineers as a college student.  God knows I wasn&#x27;t.  Here it is: it is <i>absolutely on fire</i> right now.  You know how you&#x27;ve been in a cutthroat meritocratic competition for essentially every gate you&#x27;ve ever passed through in life up until now?  Your next gate is going to be people bidding against each other to give you six figures in starting salary and a signing bonus larger than your career earnings in LoL.  (Those are Valley numbers -- it isn&#x27;t quite so white hot in every geographic area, but it&#x27;s still a seller&#x27;s market rather than a buyer&#x27;s market.)<p>Bonus points: It&#x27;s quite possible that you&#x27;ve learned enough about marketing over the Internet to be dangerous during your streaming career.  The returns for having hundreds of thousands of people following you and moving them through multiple types of conversions are, for LoL streamers, not high numbers.  Many of those same skills can be cross-applied to selling e.g. business to business software.  B2B software is <i>substantially</i> more lucrative.<p>[+] Guesstimate of current play time arrived at by years of experience rather than by latent contempt for videogaming.

In real life, the clients are not idiots, they just have conflicting requirements, and don&#x27;t understand the solution space, but they usually understand the problem space better than the developer and should be seen as a mine of information and gently guided away from making decisions they don&#x27;t understand.</i><p>The topic of the video isn&#x27;t that everyone else is an idiot, it&#x27;s that they are not deferring to the person they themselves acknowledge to be the expert to provide expert insight, perspective, knowledge, and requirements gathering.  The expert says &quot;you can&#x27;t have seven lines that are all perpendicular to each other&quot;, those outlining the requirements challenge the expert on that, as if the expert is lying or making the service provider look bad by saying something is impossible.  &quot;You&#x27;re the expert, figure it out&quot;.  &quot;Are you saying that, as an expert, you can&#x27;t do this?&quot;.  &quot;Ignore geometry&quot;.  Trying to get to the bottom of what the requirements actually are (which is often, in my experience, a misapplication, misunderstanding, or misdefinition of terms) is considered being difficult or not being a team player.<p>Also in my experience, the problem arises when the engineer is brought in the last and final stages after everyone else has already spent significant time on &quot;the problem&quot;, and are married to their unworkable solution.  The solution isn&#x27;t necessarily unworkable because it&#x27;s actually impossible, but  often it&#x27;s because what&#x27;s been requested and sold to everyone else (read: upper management) is actually too expensive to implement.  This is also where undoable aggressive schedules come from.  Make no mistake, just about everyone is bad at estimating time and effort when it comes to software projects (this is well documented, at least in the lore), but if only two weeks of time/money are budgeted for what the engineer thinks is a four week project (even if it&#x27;s actually an eight week project), no one wants to hear it.
