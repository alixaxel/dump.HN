That&#x27;s always lurking between the lines when reading the biography of a person who was living when the book was written -- it can&#x27;t compare to the more classic tell-all, &quot;Mommy Dearest&quot; kind of biographies of people no longer among the living. But the latter have their own problems.<p>In the final analysis, good writing is defined by what you leave out, not what you put in. I think Isaacson passes this test.",1398423191

Therefor engineers who need to cope with Big Data and Web Scale will continue to migrate away from relational database solutions towards persistence technology centered around distributed systems.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.<p>If you build your app around a relational database and you need to scale up big then at some point you&#x27;re going to hit a brick wall in terms of scaling out storage and/or writes. You either have to build sharding logic into your relational db app from the beginning(which is a pain that NoSQL saves you from), or else you have to re-architect your entire app when the time comes that you need to deal with scale.  Many shops end up borrowing VC money to build out a team to re-architect their systems to handle web scale, but this can be avoided by thinking about data access patterns from the beginning and choosing a technology that can handle your future needs.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_and_vertical_scaling"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalability#Horizontal_and_ver...</a>",1398422773

Why doesn&#x27;t Google let you manage an unlimited number of independent and unlinked first-class-citizen profiles under one Google Account, under any name you choose?  They can still mine all the data because they know (and keep secret!) that it&#x27;s all one person.  Facebook and Twitter do this too, just with cookies instead of login credentials.<p>People <i>want</i> to share lots of personal details on their social network.  Facebook is wildly successful because they make it easy for people to do so - perhaps to the point of oversharing.  Google could have dispensed with the whole &quot;following&quot;/&quot;circles&quot; nonsense and gone with the undirected, two-way-confirmed model (with group support) that doesn&#x27;t confuse people not familiar with graph theory, or the twitter model of basically casual, unconfirmed, directed-graph subscription, independent of the underlying personal relationship.  Either would have been fine - instead, the egghead googlers tried to solve both and ended up solving neither.<p>Last but not least, pretending that I want Google+ (no, don&#x27;t &quot;ask me again later&quot; you fucking cunt of a website) to infect all the other important basic utilities of the web that Google&#x27;s huge pile of cash has bought their way into (YouTube of course first comes to mind, but Maps and Gmail and Search too) is blatantly disrespectful to their only true asset: their users.  Even Zuckerberg doesn&#x27;t pretend like he&#x27;s doing us <i>that</i> much of a favor when Facebook once-again revises its default privacy controls downward...<p>It&#x27;s pretty simple, really.  It&#x27;s super tragic that Google has turned into such a monolith of a Big Company that it can&#x27;t even execute on a simple vision without tons of management getting involved and figuring out, through endless meetings, how to make every single step of the experience as user-hostile as possible.<p>It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re incapable of making user-centric experiences anymore.  Look at how great Maps is these days, or how Gmail&#x27;s webmail has become completely untouchable the way Outlook/Exchange or Blackberries were in their heyday - both cases because they did exactly what their customers wanted.<p>(Aside: Interestingly enough, Apple was doing this for a long time, and now with things like iAds and IAPs and carrier override of <i>my</i> ability to tether <i>my</i> phone, it seems like they are slowly beginning to fail to consider exactly why and how they got to their position as market leader.  (The argument could also be made that they are serving multiple masters - carriers/developers versus end-users.)  If they continue, as Google has, eventually their customers will be right to leave.)<p>I imagine it will take a lot of smart Googlers leaving in utter frustration before Google-the-entity finally changes course.",1398422767

Regardless of how you feel about the topic, it&#x27;s a terrific book.<p>Despite never having met or worked with the guy, I gotta side with Gruber&#x27;s take on this one: Isaacson totally missed the boat.  He was granted unprecedented (and now, unfortunately, impossible) access to a fiercely interesting person&#x27;s life, and either his lack of contextual understanding or lack of domain knowledge led to a book that is, at best, underwhelming.  His questions, his analysis, it all seemed so pedestrian and boring.<p>Maybe the lack of hard questions or deep insights is why Jobs chose him in particular to be granted such access, but I personally expected a whole fuck of a lot more from something that had so much promise to begin with.  I feel like Mossberg or maybe even someone who doesn&#x27;t write as their profession (Ive? Kottke? Kawasaki?) might have done a vastly better job.<p>Maybe I just wish I&#x27;d had a chance to know the guy, deeply flawed character and all, and no text will ultimately be sufficient - but Isaacson&#x27;s effort left me with so many more basic questions than it even began to attempt to ask, much less answer.<p>And now, all that potential wisdom to be gleaned from this specific instance falls into the realm of the unlearnable.  Perhaps that was the plan.  Who are we to assume his legacy was any less meticulously crafted than anything else he unleashed upon the world?",1398421919

Power is the important one.<p>1. Power - Near equal representation in some professions is more important that in others is because these are positions of power.  Law, medicine, journalism, film etc. Are expressions and sources of power and status/<p>The central component of discrimination against woman or minorities was always disempowerment. Most things stem from that. Under representation in positions of power is a way that disempowerment is expressed.<p>There&#x27;s a self re-enforcing dynamic to these things. Under/over representation in certain professions also create and enforce the power dynamic.<p>Women becoming lawyers, journalists & politicians was both a cause and an effect of a more equal distribution of power. This leaks into other areas. A housewife in a world of female ministers and lawyers is more powerful within her family.<p>So, is programming a position of power? Does the profession have that kind of importance. In my opinion, it is. Technology is <i>the</i> agent of change in our times. Programming & engineering are the root and stem of technology. It&#x27;s not a traditionally important profession, but I think it is one now.<p>2. Killing off vestiges of the old discriminatory world.<p>A male dominant profession can be hard for women to penetrate just because of momentum. Take a simple example from the list of female dominated professions: maternity nursing or child care. Maternity leave, career breaks & part time are probably more common and therefore tolerated in these fields than in construction or truck driving.<p>OTOH, many variants of political correctness are awful and dehumanizing. Sometimes they&#x27;re a price we need to pay for just social change, but IMO it is a price. <i>(3)If you see bad behavior from other men, speak up. (4)Don&#x27;t attempt romantic relationships. (5) No drinking</i><p>This is one of the things which leads to (and has led to) a neutered, reserved and false work culture. It encourages trolls who find ways to misinterpret intentions and &quot;take offense.&quot; It creates this dualism where people must discipline their work avatar. I don&#x27;t want to single out female inclusions. This is a complicated issue and I don&#x27;t have all my thoughts on it straight. There are a lot of casualties in honesty. Part of this forced reservedness is just the need to be diplomatic and reserved in general.<p>For me, this falseness of the &quot;corporate me&quot; people play is what makes work unpleasant.

I started programming on BBC Micros when I was 9, and there&#x27;s really no way around the fact that the only way you can know as much as I do about programming at my age is by having that kind of experience.<p>However, software is an <i>industry</i>.  We need more people, and we can&#x27;t travel back in time to teach the 10-year-olds of 2004 how to code.  It&#x27;s perverse, but part of the reason for the shitty nature of most software projects is the imbalance between demand for good software and supply of people capable of providing it.  This is what leads to over-work, death-marches, time pressure and the attempt to prevent programmers getting involved in &quot;distractions&quot; like talking to customers, figuring out what the software should <i>really</i> be doing and so on.<p>Currently, the best way for employers to maximise the amount of software they produce is to get their best coders to focus on writing code, stripping away any other aspect of the job.  Management, analysis, design, testing, all of these get shifted on to non-technical (read: easier/cheaper to hire) people who then fuck it up because they don&#x27;t know anything about how software works, or at least how the software we need right now <i>should</i> work.  Sure, it can be a good thing for developers that demand for their services is so much higher than the supply, but the long-term effects really aren&#x27;t good.  I&#x27;d rather work in a world where the obsessive programming-before-they-could-legally-drink people get to be lead developers, but the rest of the team can <i>also</i> program decently.  And that means training the latecomers properly.  (I appreciate that some of this may seem condescending to the latecomers - in all honesty, I think many people have the potential to be excellent developers given time and encouragement, but I&#x27;m trying to stick within the premise of the parent comment).",1398420125
