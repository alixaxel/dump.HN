7583263,comment,7582345,7582821,2,0,dfc,,,"> Meanwhile some people have been writing and testing small, auditable and usable open source crypto, more or less for &quot;free&quot;.<p>With all due respect that is complete bullshit. I do not care that you put quotes around free. Writing &quot;free&quot; will never be considered to include sums in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.  More importantly blatant lies like this muddy the debate and set outrageous expectations.  The Nacl project gives the following description of funding:<p><pre><code>  NaCl was initiated by the CACE (Computer Aided Cryptography Engineering)\n  project funded by the European Commission\\&#x27;s Seventh Framework Programme\n  (FP7), contract number ICT-  2008-216499. CACE activities were organized\n  into several  Work Packages (WPs). NaCl was  the main task of  CACE WP2,\n  \\&quot;Accelerating Secure  Networking,\\&quot; led  by Tanja Lange  (at Technische\n  Universiteit Eindhoven)  and Daniel  J. Bernstein (at the  University of\n  Illinois at  Chicago, currently visiting Eindhoven). CACE  nished at the\n  end of 2010 but NaCl is a continuing project.\n\n  ...Many  of  the  algorithms  used  in  NaCl  were  developed as part of\n  Daniel  J. Bernstein\\&#x27;s   High-Speed  Cryptography  project   funded  by \n  the  U.S. National  Science  Foundation, grant  number  ITR-0716498. \n</code></pre>\nI found the funding information for ITR-0716498. djb is listed as the PI for the project.[^1]  I could only find the high level funding of ICT-2008-216499.[^2] (wtf EU?) CACE WP2 is only one component of the project. I would love it if someone with better knowledge of EU funding can find the funding for the WP2 line item. The figures are:<p><pre><code>  NSF ITR-0716498 funding: (USD)     400,000.00\n  EU  2008-216499 funding: (EUR)   4,733,078.00 ***NEED WP2 line item***\n</code></pre>\nThe tweetnacl implementation lists two more funding sources. As above it was easy to locate the NSF funding but I totally struck out for the nwo funding:<p><pre><code>  NSF 1018836 funding: (USD)        $436,203.00[^3] \n  NWO grant 639.073.005 funding:    ???????????\n</code></pre>\nDon&#x27;t get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for djb and I think he and his coworkers deserve every fractional euro/dollar of funding that they received but they did not work for free. Most importantly they should not be expected to work for free.<p>[^1]: <a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0716498"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0716498</a><p>[^2]: <a href=""http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/85344_en.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/85344_en.html</a><p>[^3]: <a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1018836"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1018836</a><p>NB: This is the nwo funding site: <a href=""http://www.nwo.nl/en/funding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nwo.nl/en/funding</a> I think the english version may have a reduced set of features.

7583251,comment,7582720,7583105,4,0,jyrkesh,,,"1. First, that&#x27;s only a default install: you can easily package up a custom 7/8 install disc that gets down to 10-15 GBs. And if you compare that with a distro that installs a Windows-like window manager but default (say, stock Ubuntu, which takes up 5 GBs of space[1]), that gap narrows by a lot. Furthermore, it&#x27;s just an irrelevant point. What&#x27;s 10-20 GBs on modern desktops? Sure, the initial install will take a bit longer, but I sincerely doubt that a limiting variable for anyone right now is having a 40GB HDD instead of an 80GB HDD.<p>2. You are severely overestimating the ability of the government to hire a &quot;small dev team&quot; competent enough to build a custom Linux fork. The bulk of cost, no matter if they go Windows or Linux, is support. That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s really, really hard to manage software entirely through internal means, even if the product is completely open-source.<p>Furthermore, who&#x27;s to say that the feds don&#x27;t already have access to Windows source? At this point, it&#x27;s impossible to know, but the idea that MS could be &quot;bought off&quot; by China is absurd. They&#x27;re an American company whose operations and finances are largely based in the United States. You would have to have a high-ranking executive (or collection of executives) commit blatant treason, high the bribery money in some other country, AND convince a large number of MS developers to be completely quiet about an exploit placed in Windows source code on purpose. And not an exploit placed there under the threat of criminal punishment by the &quot;legitimate&quot; American government but an exploit that would send hundreds of employees to federal prison. I&#x27;m paranoid enough to admit that it is theoretically possible, but waaaaaay less likely than waaaaaaay more things that we should be legitimately worried about.<p>3. You say there&#x27;s &quot;no package management&quot; and then you go on to explain how there is package management but that it&#x27;s not setup correctly. The IRS is not a small business. Microsoft provides high-end support to them so that they can properly setup Active Directory and WSUS. And if they went Debian or Ubuntu, they&#x27;d pay the same money to properly setup those package managers.<p>Not to mention all the sheer costs of deploying and transitioning to a completely new infrastructure, as well as training thousands of relatively low-skill workers to use a completely foreign system. Oh, and rebuilding tons of custom software that wouldn&#x27;t be in any public package repository anyway.<p>Anyway, OP&#x27;s original point was that Windows 7 and 8 are garbage compared to XP, which is blatantly wrong. They&#x27;re both very stable operating systems, and while it&#x27;s fine to debate WHEN MS should cut off support for XP, it&#x27;s an inevitable fact that they eventually MUST. The IRS has to upgrade eventually, and they&#x27;ve had a heads up for a while. It should&#x27;ve been done already.<p>[1] <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequire...</a>",1397426245

Windows has taken backwards compatibility support to plaid (11 if you&#x27;re a fan of a different movie). I worked in an office with a data analysis tool written using Visual Fortran in the 1990s for Windows 95. Without retargeting it it runs just fine with a single launch flag set for Windows to use the appropriate compatibility mode. The cost of upgrading user applications is really the cost of <i>testing</i> user applications. Moving to * nix wouldn&#x27;t be upgrading, it&#x27;d be rewriting/porting or significant testing with Wine or some other compatibility layer. [1]<p>[1] As others pointed out, as more applications run on the CLR porting to * nix will become easier as CLR support improves on those platforms.

Ongoing patch support, however, is where MS actually shines here. Windows XP had support available for 13 years, with subsequent OSes being supported for 10+ years. In comparison, for OSes with support lengths as long as windows, like RHEL, the per-year support seat costs start at $49, which would lead to support costs of near $500 per seat over that same lifespan. So even with the IRS botching the rollout and needing to pay MS an extra year, they&#x27;re still cheaper than the few Unix offerings that provide the duration of support MS does.",1397426120

It&#x27;s to make the only crypto code path the PKCS#11 one and then make the normal case the special case of that. So you are going Apache->Gnutls/OpenSSL->custom PKCS#11 driver->fork->Gnutls/OpenSSL(to actually do the crypto). Since apache already has working code for the first and last steps you could just do Apache->fork->Gnutls/OpenSSL and be done with it.

Didn&#x27;t like my response to this, may edit later.<p>3. Now this is reasonable, software installation on Windows sucks by default. However, there are some good tools out there for handling the distribution of software. I recall using some when I worked in IT at a university. Ghost had a way to do it that was essentially taking a snapshot, installing, then another snapshot. The difference was what got installed onto the rest of the computers. There was also a piece of software we used that let us handle on-demand software installation for things with limited keys (like Matlab), I don&#x27;t remember (a decade ago now) what this one was. Not baked in, but it was more than serviceable as I recall.<p>4. IRS probably still has a fair number of mainframes.

But not from the modern Facetwitter perspective of a site that wastes your life by addicting you. The true measure should be the correctness of the content and money should pay for that.<p>First a system where you have to pay to post and if you post is confirmed as not spam or abuse, then you get the money back. Otherwise the site takes your money. Should be a negligible amount. Mostly a way to make spam expensive and compensate for moderation, but of course a site can abuse a user this way as well.<p>If a user posts some profound story/comment and others want to compensate him directly with an easy UI, they can add a monetary amount to their upvote. But there is little guarantee that the amount will be significant or the money will arrive promptly. Users should be able to undo money sent for well sounding but ultimately wrong info. This is to discourage participation driven by points and monetary rewards.<p>If participation and content creation is driven by money even more than it is now, there will be a few new legitimate sources with useful information but the vast majority will be content farms. To discourage this &quot;points&quot; or &quot;money&quot; should accumulate, BUT should not be paid out for years until the accuracy of this content is confirmed by the passage of time, peer review, etc. If mistakes are found, all readers should be notified of corrections. There should be penalties for releasing misleading or mislabeled information (like tech blog posts that are really advertising but pretend not to be. You should pay to advertise and pay more for advertising what turns out to be crap after peer review.)<p>A site should take its share for moderating content well and working on rules that incentivize useful content/services and penalize attention seeking of little utility.<p>It&#x27;s hard to predict effects of various new incentives. But a site should work on modifying the rules until desired results are reached. Users should not stray from normal behavior to satisfy some quick and dirty addicting point systems. If that means limiting participation to select trained users, releasing information to larger audiences only after it has been discussed by relevant experts (so no shocking attention grabbing studies are released) then so be it.",1397423480

So what the writer advocates is not less secure than having a single password for almost all their websites, like most people have.",1397422992

And if the cost premium of tracking is outweighed by the the value of the increased production, then tracking will continue.<p>In short, there is no one-size-fits-all answer whether tracking is cost-effective now or with dramatically different module prices.",1397422953

Therefore I&#x27;d rather someone made a service that kept all sensitive user info, like email and password, separate from my webapp. The only way to access it would be via api over a unique user ID. Then I could worry about doing the website instead of about security.<p>EDIT: Also, one teamt would fix bugs such as heartbleed, and everyone using the service would be secure. It would eliminate the security risks of leaving an old side project running.",1397422806
