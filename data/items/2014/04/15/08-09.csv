Is this becoming a new thing?<p>Send us 100k, and we&#x27;ll finish our beta application, and give you rewards, like your name in the code, or for $500, you can have a coffee with us on video chat. Or for $25,000, fly yourself here, and we&#x27;ll give you a tour of the city and cook you dinner. Does this not sound crazy to anyone else?<p>If they raise an extra $150k, they&#x27;ll develop extras, such as <i>a plug-in architecture to enable an ecosystem of open-source plug-ins for different discussion and decision-making protocols that will scale to much larger groups</i>. I don&#x27;t know what the hell that even means, but isn&#x27;t it a little irresponsible to even consider such features when you haven&#x27;t made an official release, and proven the concept has any long term traction?<p>If you can&#x27;t tell, this entire thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth. After 18 months of beta they&#x27;re unable to launch, or make enough sales to organizations to fund their development, so they&#x27;re asking the crowd for a 100k donation? I don&#x27;t believe their software is as life changing as the video makes it out to be, and I don&#x27;t think they have a viable business. I expect them to burn through the money, launch, and fade away.",1397552345
7590948,comment,7586153,7588753,1,0,graeham,,,"Depends on the goal.  If maximizing quality and length of life under constrained resources, prevention is more effective.  But, as you mention, prevention does have inherent limits on life span.  Biotechnology could allow further, perhaps infinite extension to lifespan.<p>I&#x27;m not sure this is a good goal to have.  To paraphrase Jobs in his Stanford Convocation speech, death allows the clearing of old ideas and provides urgency to motivate the living. Further, the infinite-living &quot;you&quot; would no longer really be &quot;you&quot;, since all the matter and its organisation would be replaced several times over.  (Biologically, this also happens but at a different scale so the organisation is more preserved).  Arguably, your own ideas, thoughts, and concept of self remain.",1397552345

7590936,comment,7589744,7589744,7,0,ChuckFrank,,,"I signed one of these contracts in 2006. I went to work for a company in product design and development, and since my work was new product design and development, everything I worked on at that time became the property of the company.<p>There was also a two-year non-compete clause that forbid me from working with any of their direct competitors afterwards.<p>I signed the contract because I wanted to do the work, and because I knew that all the other places would have me sign the same contract. I also thought that this company was the most progressive of the group. Finally, I wanted my ideas to be funded, and so in exchange for the time and the resources that they promised to put towards my work, I would provide them with the ideas. We were both taking risks to achieve a greater goal together.<p>In the end, they reneged on their side of the bargain and didn&#x27;t provide the necessary funding to complete the production and testing that the product design needed. After trying to get the work done myself in-house by funneling time and energy away from other projects towards mine, it came to a head and it was acknowledged that they weren&#x27;t going to fund the work and that we needed to part ways.<p>On the day that decision was made, I was escorted out, leaving everything behind, my notebooks, and all my digital research files.<p>Several years later, when they won a large contract for work that was in the area that I was working on, my manager took me out for lunch and said that I had just been about 5 years ahead of the curve, and that they hadn&#x27;t had the resources to carry that type of research and development that far ahead of a clear billable opportunity.<p>When I asked him about the files and the notebooks, he said that nothing ever happened to them, they were all just filed away in the archives.<p>I left understanding their situation well. It&#x27;s hard to fund something when it&#x27;s not clear when the payoff will materialize, and when it did materialize, they were able to get there first anyways. So the loss of five years in R&D wasn&#x27;t noticed, by them, their clients, or the industry.<p>The lesson that I did learn was - back up your files offsite, and have duplicate notebooks, one that is your private notebook and one that is your office notebook. Because when you sign a contract like this, you have to be prepared to leave everything onsite when it ends.<p>The irony with the 2 year non-compete is that after I left, non of the other firms were interested in even discussing the work that I had done. Which is why these guys were the only ones that I could have worked with in the first place, and it&#x27;s why they were the only ones able to secure the contracts when the need for the technology finally arrived.<p>And there wasn&#x27;t much I could do with the technology myself, since it was untested and unproved and I couldn&#x27;t fund the research myself. So the non-compete clause didn&#x27;t impact me much either.<p>Perhaps this sheds some light on why the contracts exist and why people like me sign them.",1397552138

If we are unable to find new sources of petroleum and/or migrate to another energy source there will be a collapse and likely the vast majority of humanity will die off. That probably would be the death kneel of civilization.<p>Now it looks like part of your argument is that shale oil and fracking is not going to produce nearly the amount of petroleum as is forecasted. That businessweek article gives some good information I didn&#x27;t know about, so good source on that. However, it looks like there is still debate around how much oil is recoverable from shale deposits. Sounds like the debates of peak oil from the past decades with one side optimistic and the other side pessimistic. I&#x27;m not a geologist, and only time will really tell who is right. But I think there is a good chance that technology will continue to improve and oil prices will rise enough to make recovery of more oil possible.<p>Now you also say that Clathrate reserve estimates have continually dropped over time. In the OP article it says,<p>>Estimates of the global supply of methane hydrate range from the equivalent of 100 times more than America’s current annual energy consumption to 3 million times more.<p>It sounds like no one has a very firm grasp of how much Clathrate is available. But even if we take the low estimate given, that&#x27;s a substantial amount. It would likely be enough to fulfil global energy needs for a couple decades. Unless you have good proof that Clathrate reserves are overestimated or that it&#x27;s unlikely we can viably tap those sources, I&#x27;m going to say that you haven&#x27;t refuted anything in the original article.<p>You said the OP article was terrifyingly stupid, but all I see as a rebuttal is that shale oil reserves are debatably not as large as we think. Or are you trying to say that our energy consumption and reliance on petroleum is at such a high and rising level that even sustaining our current production isn&#x27;t enough? To that I would argue that hopefully alternative energy sources will free up enough petroleum from electricity production to keep us above water so to speak.",1397550998

Dividing 630249409724609375H by 23e9H/s leaves us with 27e6s, or 0.8 years. That means we&#x27;d need 42 cards to crack it in a week, costing somewhere in the region of $80k (1.5k/card + extras). That puts us easily within the range of governments, companies and just generally rich geeks. You can get ~ twice the hashes/$ so maybe $40k, and if you&#x27;re cheap about the computers you connect with then probably lower.<p>But that&#x27;s consumer kit. There are also speedy MD5 FPGA cores, I&#x27;ve not got a great reference but found one from 2007 which did 44MHash / core using a Cyclone II which I can only find described as &quot;built for low cost&quot;. Assuming a 5x cost/hash reduction would grab us at $8k which would be in the range of hobbyists.<p>Beyond this, several private companies have been able to build double SHA-256 ASICs (for bitcoin mining). You could buy a while ago kit that did 7GHash for $300ish, and there&#x27;s supposedly some 1THash ones in development. Granted, double SHA-256 is not equivalent to MD5, but I&#x27;d be surprised if MD5 was significantly harder, and expect it to be a lot simpler. Now the development cost of these is the expensive bit, but then your hashing rate would be insane.<p>Ramble over, if anyone has any figures for FPGAs or ASICs then I&#x27;d be really interested.",1397550115
