I have developed a product that I think would be great if it was free because not many open source, free versions of it exists but I also don&#x27;t want it to cannibalize my paid products and subscriptions.<p>Is my assumption correct in that people who would&#x27;ve paid for my product would now be satisfied with the open source, free version that I released and never end up paying for the full version? Even worse, someone customizing it using their own inhouse development resources, productizing it with their own brand and selling it and becoming my competitor.<p>I am concerned about working all those hours into the product, open sourcing it (thereby making it available at competitors hands) and not getting paid for it.<p>I am also assuming that I could get some free marketing when I release the free version...but I&#x27;m not sure if this offsets the cannibalization of sales.",1397282219

What happened in this book was lazy research and poor journalism.  There have been plenty of factual critiques, which should set off flags around a book that purports to be an expose.  But he spends more of the book moralizing and appealing to pathos than actually explaining how things are.  As an immigrant, I thought it was cheap how often race was brought up in the book (examples: at some point one of the protagonists had a &quot;this is how we do it in America&quot; moment, whereas several HFT programmers were noted to be Russian, and as I recall Lewis saying, Russia helped them because in addition to forcing them to write clever, efficient code, they had learned to take advantage of the corrupt system.

7577100,comment,7572340,7573134,6,0,kaptain,,,"While most of the discussion here is technical from engineering and business perspectives, your question digs more at the root of the problem: this is a cultural and institutional problem.<p>I live in China: people pinch pennies (or mao) here without taking into account the overall cost. This is why you have a large market for imported goods; even amongst the most nationalistic Chinese consumer, there is an assumption that imported goods are better because domestic products are made by cutting corners.<p>There&#x27;s a strong suspicion of things that are priced cheaply but, bizarrely, people still buy cheap goods but are resigned to the product failing rather quickly. This just doesn&#x27;t apply to electronics, but also to clothes, vehicles, etc.<p>There&#x27;s a very strong tension between value-pricing and product quality. That is, there is a demand low prices but assume that the product quality is poor. On the other side of the spectrum there is a demand for high-quality &quot;luxury&quot; goods too. Thus pricing your product too low, even though it may be a quality product, basically indicates that it is a low-quality product.<p>Part of the myopia here is that people will cut corners without figuring out the benefit/risk ratio. That is, is it worth losing a contract to improve your bottom-line by  a negligible percentage? Culturally (and I&#x27;m speaking in a broad generalization here) there&#x27;s a desire to &quot;win&quot; at a contract... to make the contract be better for yourself than what&#x27;s on paper. So even if the contract spells out your profit margin, it&#x27;s a matter of pride to be able to improve on it (aka, &quot;sticking it to the man&quot;). With China&#x27;s large population and widening gap between rich and everyone else, there&#x27;s a perception that you have to get rich or die trying; no one else is going to help you... certainly not the government.<p>China&#x27;s future could be a lot brighter than it is; the problems aren&#x27;t technical.",1397281659

Instead of moving services into trusted user-level processes, they manage protection at the level of hardware resources rather than services. This enables those services to be in untrusted shared libraries that can be securely modified or bypassed on a per-application basis.<p>Thus, instead of the lingering &quot;eh, it&#x27;s a little slower but we can ignore that,&quot; exokernels provide much better opportunities for optimization and tend to be much faster. For example, a database could choose to discard and regenerate index pages rather than swap them out to disk and back; a file copy program could issue large, asynchronous reads and writes of all the copied files at once; a web server could use its knowledge of HTTP to merge packets, or co-locate files from web pages to improve disk seek time.<p>Further, exokernels and microkernels are not mutually exclusive; they are rather orthogonal concepts (you could move an exokernel&#x27;s drivers into user space processes if you wanted). If we had hardware that were more conducive to a microkernel design, for example with direct process switching rather than going through the kernel (32-bit x86 did this with task gates, but they weren&#x27;t used much and were abandoned with 64-bit), this would probably be the optimal design, rather than a purist microkernel approach. Incidentally, the in-development Mill CPU design does this very efficiently, as well as a few other things that are good for both micro and exo-kernels.",1397280443

I only suggest a possibility. There&#x27;s a possibility that this group of hominids killed each other in some kind of civil war or died in some drought.<p>And i hope this isn&#x27;t a revelation, but the narrative is real. Bad europeans did kill peaceful indians. That doesn&#x27;t mean that all europeans are bad and all indians were peaceful. But largely, that narrative is hard to deny. All kinds of humans have done bad things to people who really just wanted to be left alone. To me, though it may not be the whole story, it&#x27;s a true fact. I merely suggest that it is a very real possibility that humans hunted this hominid group down and slaughtered them all while the hominids wanted to be left alone. I don&#x27;t see how you can not consider that scenario if you are wondering how a group of hominids became extinct.",1397280024

In that case, isn&#x27;t the whole point that it&#x27;s something the user will notice?<p><i>I&#x27;ve always been a big proponent of small, atomic commits.</i><p>And again, no argument from me there. While I don&#x27;t think every development project is suitable for that approach, I favour it most of the time myself.<p><i>Being able to deploy just one thing at a time means we often know where breakage comes from (when it happens)</i><p>This is where my experience and background seem to be very different to the deploy-hourly kind of philosophy. I&#x27;ve noticed that proponents of the latter often seem to assume that stuff is going to be breaking all the time, and therefore that being able to deploy bug fixes or diagnostics very quickly will be a significant advantage.<p>However, if you have so many significant bugs that you need to deploy multiple times per day just to keep up, to me that seems like a clear demonstration of insufficient QC/QA in the development process. And so I can&#x27;t help wondering whether the pressure to release so often, and the consequent almost exclusive reliance on some sort of automated test suite for quality checking, is a causal factor in having so many bugs in the first place.<p><i>The customers love it, and we enjoy excellent stability and development velocity. These are the reasons we deploy many times a day. There&#x27;s no reason for us not to deploy things once they are tested and ready.</i><p>I guess this is the paradoxical part that I don&#x27;t understand. If your project enjoys excellent stability and your deployments are all soundly tested before they go live, then by definition you don&#x27;t need the rapid deployments just to rush out bug fixes or diagnostics.<p>So that brings me back to where I came in: do you experience any concrete, measurable benefits from the &quot;excellent development velocity&quot; you mentioned, or is it simply your team&#x27;s preferred development style?",1397279438
