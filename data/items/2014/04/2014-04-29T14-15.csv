7667397,comment,7666866,7667291,3,0,mickeyp,,,"SQLite is not <your actual rdbms>... it&#x27;s SQLite. A database that does not enforce column types and lacks most of the advanced features of a real rdbms. Using SQLite will work great right up until the point where it won&#x27;t and you get your fingers burnt.<p>If you separate your concerns properly you won&#x27;t need to mock the database layer either. Mocking is just one part of the trifecta of good testing, along with Stubbing and Faking.<p>For most things it would make more sense to <i>fake</i> the database layer or <i>stub</i> the database layer in your &quot;logic&quot; layer.<p>However, if your application makes heavy use of the rdbms then you should test that layer too: In your integration tests and not your unit tests. Most places that interact with an RDBMS treat them like black boxes and not like a business layer of its own. You really need integration tests to ensure things like constraints and your business rules are captured properly... most people never bother.<p>The real problem with TDD and its methodologies isn&#x27;t TDD itself; it&#x27;s people shoehorning about 10% of what proper testing should be into two narrow groups: stuff that you can do with &quot;unit tests&quot; and &quot;things we can mock.&quot; There&#x27;s a lot more to it than just those two things.",1398783575

Priority of traffic.  If my neighbor is bit-torrenting The Avengers I still want to be able to have my VoIP call work.  He doesn&#x27;t really care if his packets move marginally slower while I really care that my packets get through nearly all the time.<p>The rejoinder here is &quot;well the ISPs should always make enough bandwidth for both of us.&quot;  But the very nature of shared networks is that what my neighbor does can affect me.  If you want a channel reserved for yourself, get a leased line and pay the expensive premium for it.  (Or buy a guaranteed channel on the shared pipe, but that runs into the same issue with net neutrality.)<p>2. Companies with more money will always be able to buy better access.  You can say &quot;well we shouldn&#x27;t make it even easier to them to be faster,&quot; but at a certain point this logic leads to crazy things like making it illegal for Netflix to use a private network running parallel to the Internet to move things faster to their CDN end points.<p>I want a net neutrality that stops my cable company from interfering with my Vonage packets because they want me to sell me their own VoIP service.  I want a net neutrality where my ISP doesn&#x27;t care if my video packets are coming from Microsoft or Netflix or YouTube.  But that doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;ll sign up for anything wrapped in a &quot;net neutrality&quot; flag that is trying to nail jelly to a tree.",1398783550

Anywhere that implied iteration count is always a constant, I&#x27;m probably not structuring my code correctly.<p>Passing around two iterators is still not safe, due to iterator invalidation.<p>Memory safety in the C++ model is a hard problem.<p>> So my recommendation is to use references (foo&) for passing down (well, up) the stack, never to heap allocated objects.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is practical. Consider `operator[]` on a vector, which returns a reference to a heap allocated object.

When you consider that motivation, the trust factor cited in that critique as making a cartel attack <i>less</i> viable based on how undermining trust in bitcoin also undermines the ability to make a direct profit by double spending is irrelevant (or, rather, illustrates exactly why a double-spending cartel may be attractive to a bitcoin-hostile entity that wants to undermine trust in the bitcoin system.)",1398782467

7667233,comment,7666034,7666664,1,0,roymurdock,,,"&quot;It is often asserted (for example, in the Bitcoin white paper [22]) that a cartel can double-spend Bitcoins. In a strict sense, this is true: a cartel can spend a Bitcoin by paying it to a player Alice, receiving goods or services, and then shifting the consensus choice of history to a branch where that coin is instead paid to a different player Bob. However, we argue that double-spending by a cartel has a limited payoff. Bitcoins have value because people are willing to trade them for goods and services. If players were unwilling to accept Bitcoins for trade or unwilling to spend Bitcoins for fear of having their payments nullified, the value of Bitcoins would diminish significantly as players lost confidence in the system.<p>Worse, because players are encouraged to generate a new identity for each transaction and because identities are not linked to any side information, players cannot easily determine whether a proffered payment is coming from the double-spending cartel or an honest user. Thus, a rational player should refuse to accept any payments when there is a significant threat of double-spending. As a cartel must outmine the entire Bitcoin network and thus outspend the entire Bitcoin network for as long as it would remain a cartel, we believe it is very unlikely that a cartel could double-spend enough to recover the cost of the attack.&quot; - The Economics of Bitcoin Mining in the Presence of Adversaries (11-12)",1398782165

In this way 2/3rds of the cost of the bill was applied to their debt and they slowly paid it off. In my experience this is a much better way to collect as they see benefit from from it as well (food) and it feels less like just having to hand over money to the lender.<p>EDIT: As it turns out they have an API [0] so I guess I could write something that would auto-add &quot;bills&quot; for interest if I wanted to but my current setup works fine ATM and I feel like some of my friends would not be happy with being charged interest :).<p>[0] <a href=""http://dev.splitwise.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.splitwise.com/</a>",1398780914

Many in the rails community <i>do</i> use it as a substitute for thinking.<p>In general, I&#x27;m not the biggest DHH supporter (although, he&#x27;s made me a ton of money, indirectly, via rails), but I do like that he&#x27;s stirring the pot here.<p>Back in the 90s and early 2000s, I wrote tests, when needed.  Sometimes before application code, sometimes after, it was a discretionary tool that I had in my arsenal that helped me both solve problems and feel confident that &quot;my code won&#x27;t break&quot;.<p>At some point in time the majority of the rails community decided that if you don&#x27;t test, you&#x27;re a terrible programmer.  Full Stop.<p>The problem with this was that testing tools were terrible at the time, RSpec, before it&#x27;s API solidified was breaking every other release, things like capybara and selenium and watir, always kinda worked, but not really, and you&#x27;d often spend 10 minutes writing the business logic, and then 40 minutes writing tests, getting them to pass, wrestling with external dependencies, etc.<p>Furthermore, because people were practicing test-based application design, you were constantly re-writing your codebase and your test suite, because if you&#x27;re designing for tests, you&#x27;re not designing for the domain, and as domain requirements changed, and broke your testing model, you basically had to fix everything, and you couldn&#x27;t get a handle on the domain because you had to be ruled by tests.<p>All that said, I do think tests are useful.  TDD isn&#x27;t as useful for me.  My thoughts are in line with Rich Hickey who said:<p>&quot;Life is short and there are only a finite number of hours in a day. So, we have to make choices about how we spend our time. If we spend it writing tests, that is time we are not spending doing something else. Each of us needs to assess how best to spend our time in order to maximize our results, both in quantity and quality. If people think that spending fifty percent of their time writing tests maximizes their results—okay for them. I’m sure that’s not true for me—I’d rather spend that time thinking about my problem. I’m certain that, for me, this produces better solutions, with fewer defects, than any other use of my time. A bad design with a complete test suite is still a bad design.&quot;<p>From <a href=""http://www.codequarterly.com/2011/rich-hickey/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codequarterly.com/2011/rich-hickey/</a>",1398780829

I have fond memories of those early versions of Firefox (nee Firebird) that busted open the IE monopoly, and where hands-down the best browser going at the time.<p>But it&#x27;s never felt very good on the Mac to me, and it still doesn&#x27;t. Here&#x27;s a few early thoughts on this release, from the perspective of a happy Safari user, w/ a pretty (nit-)picky eye.<p>* Separate address and search bars is old-fashioned. As a user, I don&#x27;t want to have to make this distinction, and it&#x27;s hard to imagine most users-on-street wouldn&#x27;t find this confusing<p>* The address bar is square edged while the search bar is round edged, which is displeasingly visually. (I realize this is because there&#x27;s a convention of &quot;search bars are rounded,&quot; but the inconsistency remains.)<p>* Tapping the hamburger menu on the far right, it appears with a combined drop-and-fade-in effect, and then disappears instantly.<p>This is jarring on the Mac, because it is exactly the opposite of native menu behavior, which is to appear instantly, and disappear with a fade. (I also believe the native behavior makes more sense: when you&#x27;re tapping a menu, you want to do something, so you don&#x27;t want to be slowed down by an animation -- just show the menu.)<p>(Addition of a hamburger bar on the far right at all is suspicious; often it&#x27;s a UI &quot;dumping ground&quot;)<p>* The &quot;what&#x27;s new&quot; slideshow that appears at the bottom of the screen has to be controlled by clicking small <- or -> arrows, instead of just scrolling, which feels very outmoded<p>* The scroller applies a fade effect to incoming content, but only to the text, not the image, which is jarring.<p>* Multi-touch swipe to go back/forward shows no feedback! (Safari does this best, where the whole page slides away, revealing what&#x27;s underneath; Chrome does a half-assed thing with arrows fading in, which isn&#x27;t nearly as nice, but at least better than no feedback.)<p>Pretty nitpicky, I know, but I recently read an article trumpeting this release of Firefox&#x27;s incredible attention to detail.<p>On the Mac at least, I think it still falls short.",1398780465

The following kind of shenanigans won&#x27;t be allowed outside of unsafe regions:<p><pre><code>  int main()\n  {\n    int on_stack;\n    int& ref = on_stack;\n    int* ptr = static_cast<int*>(&ref);\n    delete ptr;\n    return 0;\n  }\n</code></pre>\nYes, it&#x27;s obviously bad code, but C++ happily let me write it, and it compiled with no warnings under -Wall -Wpedantic.",1398780297

Just as a fork and knife is a standard symbol on maps for a reastraunt, (even ones where you use your hands or chopsticks), the symbols become their meaning, not their appearence (see Egyptian hieroglyphs).
