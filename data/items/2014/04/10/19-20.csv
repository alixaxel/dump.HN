You have to know that it&#x27;s a hydrocarbon-based engine, more so you need to know it&#x27;s a spark-based engine (gasoline), not a pressure based engine (diesel), or even something else (CNG).<p>Also, if I want to get the most performance out of the car, or do something nonstandard, I need to know about the energy extraction process in order to pick better fuel or to adjust timings in the engine. (Sure most people won&#x27;t, but if you want to, it&#x27;s nice to have the information available).",1397159992

I don&#x27;t hold them out as infallible, even about their own course, but it should give us pause, yes?<p>They have a lot of data, we have ... <i>opinions</i>. And the data was saying that students were having trouble learning to do practical engineering problems after this course. So, 2 hours or not (and I say not), the reality is that really bright students had trouble with it, and their professors and designer of the course, co-inventor of the language, and author of SICP thought Python a better choice than Scheme for this course.<p>Empiricism trumps all.",1397159989

Lime.js did this three years ago (mapping animations to hardware-accelerated CSS). Cocos2Dx-Javascript does this one step better by bridging into actually-native rendering code.

7569284,comment,7565577,7569189,8,0,gojomo,,,"Yes, but using a counterfeit certificate requires a much more active, targeted, and potentially-discoverable attack.<p>With a counterfeit cert, you could pretend to be a target&#x27;s email host, for example. But you&#x27;d need to be an active man-in-the-middle, and you&#x27;d only see information during the sessions you actively hijack. The target, or anyone else you mistakenly man-in-the-middle, might notice the changed certificate/authority, thus sounding alarms or clamming up.<p>If exploiting heartbleed, in contrast, you&#x27;d be taking arbitrarily-many random samples of the email host&#x27;s private memory, in a manner that even the email host&#x27;s typical logging would <i>not</i> notice. Over time, you&#x27;d likely get many login credentials, app and SSL session keys, and possibly even the site&#x27;s authentic certificate private key – that&#x27;s something that even a faithless Certificate Authority can&#x27;t cough up. (They can certify a fake private key... but they don&#x27;t have their customer&#x27;s true private keys.) At that point, unless PFS is enabled, <i>all</i> past and future SSL sessions could be decoded via <i>passive</i> eavesdropping.<p>So if you had a choice between several collaborating CAs <i>or</i> most of the internet running buggy OpenSSL, you&#x27;d pick the buggy OpenSSL. And if you had both, you might very well use the heartbleed bug more often, because it&#x27;s both less detectable and more likely to offer bulk data for analysis.",1397159928

7569279,comment,7568851,7569154,0,0,atmosx,,,"I&#x27;m not an economist, but economists are not good at speculating either, looking at the results: As a a team, economists failed to preview every single financial crisis. Only after the shit hits the fan, media goes back to the few who were able to predict the crisis. There are always solitary birds singing out of the chorus. The chorus never get it right though.<p>To your statements now:<p>1) That&#x27;s true, but doesn&#x27;t mean anything if you put it out of context and the context might very well change in a couple of years. Crypto-currencies are evolving now, new ones are created trying to tackle bitcoin&#x27;s flaws. Now seems unlikely but in the future some might be more successful than bitcoin. It&#x27;s a new sector.<p>2) There no central governing body, but an investor with a big amount of bitcoin (say 2% of the total) might easily drive the price up, down or side-ways. It&#x27;s like a financial (assets) market really, a little bit of miss-information and a massive dump of bitcoins will turn the price down at once.<p>It doesn&#x27;t make any sense for a merchant to accept bitcoin if:<p>1) He is not the guy holding a huge bitcoin portofolio or plants too. Say Starbucks as a corporation starts accepting bitcoin today, in 6 month does a massive investment in the bitcoin market. If the investment is big enough the price will go up (supposedly).<p>2) If they have some inside information which allows them to predict with an acceptable risk the future price of bitcoin.<p>Other than that - and I&#x27;d go for that theory - it doesn&#x27;t make sense. It&#x27;s just a marketing trick. They are not expecting big amounts, just very small amounts because as you said bitcoiners are basically short or long term hoarders. But I&#x27;m sure they are ready to absorb any bitcoin drop up to a point, but not further. So I&#x27;m positive they wouldn&#x27;t accept 20% of their turn-over being on bitcoin (if they are not feeling suicidal).",1397159860

7569269,comment,7566069,7567700,82,0,EliAndrewC,,,"Debates on Brendan Eich and Condoleezza Rice seem to boil down three separate questions:<p>1) Is there any belief or action not directly related to someone&#x27;s job that should disqualify them from their position?<p>2) If the answer to #1 is yes, does this specific issue cross that threshold?<p>3) Does the answer to #1 change based on their position within a company, e.g. a regular employee vs a CEO?<p>I&#x27;ve seen well-reasoned arguments for many different combinations of those opinions, and I have a lot of respect for most of the combinations I&#x27;ve seen, e.g.<p>- Even if a white separatist contributed money to a campaign to revive &quot;separate but equal&quot; Jim Crow legislation, we shouldn&#x27;t oppose their employment if they have a history of working well with all co-workers/employees in a diverse company.<p>- Some political beliefs/actions would disqualify someone, but gay marriage equality is not (yet) beyond the pale, especially given the high percentage of Americans who hold the same beliefs.<p>- Gay marriage is indeed an issue that should reasonably factor into employment positions, but only for a select few leadership positions such as CEO due to the disproportionate power within a company held by people in those few positions.<p>What makes these debates problematic is people talking past each other without realizing they&#x27;re debating different questions.  This gets worse because each of the 3 questions I listed have many sub-categories.<p>Since grellas&#x27; posted about question #1, I hope people recognize that and tailor their responses to the argument he is actually making, in the spirit of &quot;colleagues trying to reason out the truth together&quot;.  Because he argued for employment to be belief-neutral, I&#x27;ll summarize the three arguments I&#x27;m seeing on these threads which are relevant to that specific question:<p>1) Past behavior is a signal for future action, and Rice&#x27;s position on the Board of Directors sends an unacceptable signal about how seriously Dropbox takes privacy.  Even a person against boycotts based on political or religious beliefs has strong reason to oppose Rice&#x27;s appointment to the Board.<p>2) Rice is a war criminal who happens to have not been prosecuted.  Refusing to do business with a company who appointed a criminal who&#x27;d committed equivalently-serious-but-non-political crimes and escaped prosecution wouldn&#x27;t raise any eyebrows, so why should this?<p>3) All people have a responsibility to discourage behaviors which are provably detrimental to the functioning of a well-ordered society.  General litmus-testing of beliefs (or even actions) causes more problems than it solves, but Rice&#x27;s behavior was so far over the line that we are morally obligated to marginalize her and all of her colleagues who behaved similarly during the Bush administration.<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether I agree with any of the above arguments, but I respect each of them, and I hope that either Hacker News figures out how to debate them civilly or that the moderators pull all stories like this off the frontpage.",1397159782
7569268,comment,7565577,7569077,6,0,secfirstmd,,,"Well this could end up being a whole essay...<p>I would say that generally it depends on the threat model and risk versus potential adversary (some African states would be different to China in capabilities etc). I think also a big part is really internalising and enforcing the idea that you will be breached at some point and acting accordingly, to minimise the data lose and be able to recover. So for example, if your only doing low risk stuff then the convenience of something like Windows/Mac and normal email service outweighs any risks from a breach (as long as you know how to access risk correctly and take the sensible/basic precautions). However for higher risk stuff then generally open-source solutions can potentially offer more security (too many to mention but tons of good ones here - Tails, TOR etc: <a href=""https://prism-break.org/\u200E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://prism-break.org/\u200E</a>).<p>I would caveat though that I am not someone who always drink the open-source koolaid all of the time. I think the recent Heartbleed and suspicions about TrueCrypt goes to show that occasionally we are make assumptions about the security of these tools based on a false sense of security. Proper security is a longer process of peer review, code audits etc that everyone kind of just takes for granted are done with open-source projects.<p>Sometimes I think it&#x27;s a little bit like the &quot;free rider&quot; problem, were everyone (including so many in relation to OpenSSL) is happy to use the tool but don&#x27;t want to spend time/money/brainpower looking, adding, reviewing the underlying code. Then we get a lot of myths emerging (TrueCrypt is very safe for example - that might be the case but has it really been audited yet? Also, who is doing the auditing? etc).<p>Obviously the fact that open source stuff is free and the code can be looked at and eventually fixed is a very good thing. Also, usability is a security feature and I think some of the secure open-source alternatives have problems in this area - though the work of the Guardian Project, Whisper Systems etc  is doing a great job of fixing this aspect of things.<p>Apologies if I got a bit sidetracked on this answer. If there is more specific advice you want, drop me a mail to the email (low risk stuff only) in my profile.",1397159769

There&#x27;s a finite amount of them that can ever be mined<p>2.

So I decided to give them another try.<p>This time the food comes on time. So much care went into their packaging. I heat up the food and it comes out - woah. So delicious. Real food with real ingredients. The total, including delivery fee, was $15.

At the time, I was working at EA, miserable, and highly motivated to have the book done so it could help pad my resume. I got a book deal (O&#x27;Reilly) then, when that fell through, another (Apress). I had a real writing schedule, and a very supportive wife, and I would work on it for hours at a time.<p>Then I left the game industry, moved across the country, and had another kid. Suddenly, motivation and time were scarce. I backed out of the book deal and basically put it on hiatus for two years. I still really wanted to finish it but it just wasn&#x27;t happening.<p>About a year ago, I realized that if I didn&#x27;t finish it soon, I never would. My familiarity with the domain was fading every day. I didn&#x27;t want the project to be a failure, so I decided to try writing every day.<p>I didn&#x27;t have a set goal each day, but I try to do around 30-45 minutes. That ends up being ~500 words of first draft, ~1,000 words of later revisions.<p>In the past 309 days, I&#x27;ve finished 12 chapters. That&#x27;s 59,568 words, plus a few thousand more for intro sections. I&#x27;ve redesigned the site twice, set up a mailing list, gotten a business license, and a bunch of other grunt work.<p>I&#x27;m about halfway through the very last chapter now (!).

I work in a position where I am somewhat responsible for decisions such as whether to use AWS or not, which at other companies has been a different decision such as what hardware to purchase and where to install it.<p>This is a difficult situation to balance, because what you are suggesting, from my perspective, ends up being about saying, &quot;I will quit working here unless we quit using Vendor X!&quot; - that will end predictably, and I have lost that fight over GoDaddy as well.  At the end of a day of following such a philosophy, I have no job, the Evil Vendor(tm) still gets their money, and I have to explain to people at Next Potential Job(tm) why I don&#x27;t seem to be a team player.<p>That said, these are important fights to fight at some level.  When I was dealing with hardware, I found many of our decisions frustrating.  I found it frustrating that we cared about the USD$ cost of power, and not the environmental cost of it.  I found it frustrating that we turned off almost all power saving features of our hardware because they don&#x27;t deliver as one would hope and tend to harm the workload in a way that may actually require more gear which is expensive, has a carbon cost to manufacture, and has a carbon cost to operate and cool.  Guess what? a 2U Rackmount server that sometimes runs at 1.5Ghz for a few seconds instead of running at 2.8GHz all of the time doesn&#x27;t have a significant impact on the cooling bill, and it can reasonably be expected that your cooling power budget will be roughly equal to your equipment power budget, probably higher because of infrastructure overhead.<p>It is difficult to find a framework in which to push these decisions because the day to day business does not center around them.<p>The solution is for decision makers to make them a priority, just like worker safety and other things which don&#x27;t obviously contribute to the short-term bottom line.  I can&#x27;t spend all of my time advocating up for socially responsible decisions.<p>Also, Amazon may be in a difficult place wrt other contracts with the government, they may have gotten themselves somewhat entangled.

Too bad there is already another language called Aurora...<p>I makes me think of Elm [1] and (functional) reactive programming. Reactive programming is fantastic. It&#x27;s kind of like how a spreadsheet program works. If a variable changes, all variables who depend on it change as well. Given &quot;a = b + c&quot;, if c increments by 1, so does a.<p>It has many advantages over event based systems, like Javascript. Reactive programs don&#x27;t need callbacks. The changing values propagate the &quot;event&quot; through the system.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear what you guys think about this direction of programming. It seems very natural to me.<p>Edit: I also see reactive programming as the golden way of having changing state in functional languages. Functional languages have no problem with data or state. They have a problem with change of state. The reactive paradigm solves that problem. All change is implicit and code can be exactly as functional as before.<p>[1] <a href=""http://elm-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elm-lang.org/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming</a>",1397156570

Glibc, gcc, as examples. Trying to get them to fix their broken crap or reverse their idiotic decisions takes decades. If OpenSSL is less opposed to change, it&#x27;s probably a good thing, considering the purpose of it.<p>> NSS has a clearer identity, as the TLS core for Firefox and Chromium. OpenSSL is a grab bag with hundreds of different stakeholders.<p>Do you not remember the myriad bugs that came out of Microsoft&#x27;s, Netscape&#x27;s and others&#x27; independently-developed SSL implementations when their only relevant benchmark was <i>their own tools</i>? They didn&#x27;t give a shit if it broke someone else&#x27;s tool because they didn&#x27;t make it to support someone else&#x27;s tool.<p>> The most important code in both NSS and OpenSSL is the SSL state machine. The code for that state machine is incontrovertibly clearer and better expressed in NSS.<p>So clean up the OpenSSL code! If your previous claim that it&#x27;s easy to get code into OpenSSL is true, fix it! Don&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bathwater!<p>> NSS has had better battle-testing as a clientside browser TLS library than OpenSSL, which, apart from Android Chrome, isn&#x27;t a big factor in TLS clientsides.<p>OpenSSL is used in hundreds of TLS clients in all kinds of environments around the world. It&#x27;s the de facto client library for 90% of open source tools. As opposed to whatever environments run NSS applications which is far fewer.<p>It seems like these are arguments <i>for</i> OpenSSL, not against it.",1397156519
