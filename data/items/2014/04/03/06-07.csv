7521340,comment,7519094,7521082,1,0,nostrademons,,,"The goals I set are objective, dependent upon the state of the outside world at some future point in time.  The meta-goal I set, of living a happy life, is subjective, dependent upon only my own experience.  I don&#x27;t always achieve it, but I take failure to be happy at any given point in time as a signal that I need to change something in either the internal or external world.<p>The point I&#x27;m making - and this is pretty much straight out of a few philosophy courses in college - is that there&#x27;s a fact/value distinction.  Whether or not you achieved a goal is a <i>fact</i> - if you&#x27;re setting them right, it&#x27;s measurable and externally verifiable.  Whether that goal is <i>good</i> or not is a <i>value</i> - there is no possible way to answer that question other than resorting to your personal value system (or adopting someone else&#x27;s personal value system).  Your personal value system might decree that &quot;It&#x27;s a good thing when I achieve my goals&quot; - but there is nothing inherent about that, only that you have decided to live your life in a goal-driven way.  Other people may hold different values.  I do, for example - after much self-examination, I figured out that I&#x27;m really <i>discovery</i>-driven, and for me, learning things is an inherent good and achieving my goals is only instrumental.<p>Also, there&#x27;s a distinction between inherent and instrumental values.  An inherent value is something that&#x27;s intrinsically good, based on your value system.  An instrumental value is something that helps you achieve an inherent value.  Many of your goals will be to satisfy instrumental values - if they fail, then you try another approach, you don&#x27;t think of it as a failure.<p>To answer your (rhetorical) question: yes, I&#x27;ve written buggy code, and sometimes I&#x27;ve written buggy code <i>deliberately</i>.  The reason - in the instance I&#x27;m thinking about - was because writing the correct code would&#x27;ve increased latency (this was Javascript, where all the program logic has to be shipped to the client).  User happiness was the inherent value, and performance was judged to be a more effective instrument to get there than correctness.  So the decision made was to ship the buggy code despite it being buggy, because that actually achieved our purposes much better than making it correct.<p>That&#x27;s the sort of flexibility you get from understanding what you&#x27;re <i>really</i> going for and what are just steps to get you there.  You can swap out the steps if they don&#x27;t work out.",1396508208

In this specific case, there is an obvious wrong side (systemd) and an obvious right. However it appears like egos have taken over technical merits in this discussion.<p>On the other hand though, I am glad every time something like this happens because it just reaffirms my belief that Open Source is not just a good &#x27;philosophy&#x27; but a good engineering practice. Where technical considerations outweigh personal quirks ...for the most part. I say for the most part because, the role of the maintainer obviously matters a whole lot.

KeePass Professional Edition is what I use since it offers several huge advantages.<p>First, you only need to come up with one good password (the one for the actual password file). If you ever leave the job, you just have to give them that one password and they can access the rest.<p>Second, it makes it easy for you to have good passwords for your resources. Plus, each resource can have a different password, so it may help limit the spread of an attack.<p>Third, if the company hires more IT staff, you can just copy the password file, rename it, change the password, give it to the new person, and have them change the password again. Probably not the best solution for 5+ people, but works well enough in small groups.<p>Fourth, KeePass offers a portable installation, which you can stick in Dropbox, on a usb drive, or wherever (no internet access needed). This is really helpful when you need to type in the password to the firewall that just took down the internet to your network.<p>Fifth, it&#x27;s open source and free!",1396507680

Yes, pure JS is bit hard to maintain and it does occasionally pisses me off but at the same time it is liberating.<p>Not having to constantly keep adding types all over, not having to constantly refactor things because I now accept object instead of an int etc is refreshing. And best of all, not having <i>compile</i> at all is fast and simple. I&#x27;m only using JS frameworks that doesn&#x27;t force me do build before testing the page and retains purity of JavaScript (that means no simulations of traditional OOP). Yes, sometime I do make bad mistakes and spend some time chasing down bugs that would have been caught in typed languages. However overall I find cost of adding types all over and maintaining them over the evolution of code is actually higher. It would have been really great if they had produced cool algorithms that could have inferred types as much as possible and added it as static analysis tool instead of JS extension.<p>Just because JS doesn&#x27;t have type checking I&#x27;m now set in to mindset of doing quick tests of small changes, write more elaborate tests and so on. Even in moderately large project I think pure JavaScript is not only <i>maintainable</i> but also joy to work with compared to typed languages.",1396507453

This does not break algebra any more than, say, restricting the domain of the square root (when working in the reals) to non-negative numbers.  We work in restricted domains in mathematics all the time.<p>> &quot; f&#x27;(x) = 2x/x&quot;<p>f&#x27;(x) = lim (h->0) [2(x+h)-2x]/h.  Since h is approaching (and therefore not equal to) zero, there is no problem.  Any appearance of 0/0 in the problem is a result of an attempted (but unsuccessful, that is, indeterminate) evaluation -- it&#x27;s not actually 0/0, it&#x27;s 2h/h where h is close to but not equal to 0.<p>We don&#x27;t need to define 0/0=1 in order to have either algebra or calculus work.  We choose to define 0/0=1 in certain circumstances which make certain calculations go more smoothly, and we choose not to define 0/0 in other circumstances where it&#x27;s either unnecessary or potentially misleading.",1396506250
