It might compete with it, and there are people called &#x27;cord cutters&#x27; that dump Cable TV, U-Verse, Satellite TV etc to watch videos on the Internet.<p>Heck Youtube is now offering channels for a monthly fee.<p>I think we should call it Internet TV, because we are watching TV shows and movies over the Internet instead of Cable or Satellite.<p>The WWE just did this with their WWE Network for $9.99/month that has all of their old shows and pay per view events. That NXT show moved to WWE Network, and they made more WWE Shows for the WWE Network. I predict other media companies will make their own Internet TV Networks this way.<p>I think there is money to be made in Internet TV with Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Google TV, Apple TV, and video game consoles can play Internet TV shows too. Plus any smart phone or tablet has Internet TV apps now as well. But it is not the end of Cable TV, just cutting into their business.",1396666721

This text describes a libertarian socialist society which is presumably devoid of taxation: &quot;What is needed is Individualism. If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first.&quot;.

So it&#x27;s useful to dispel the notion that because its &quot;not seen&quot; it&#x27;s not a problem. It might not always a <i>be</i> problem, but many it is and others it&#x27;s also &quot;annoying&quot;.<p>Stepping outside of markets for a second, this is why M&A deals have exclusivity and breakage terms. The theory/practive on why you do this involves assymetric information and something economists refer to as &quot;opportunism&quot;. Opportunism[1] is exploiting legal abiguity for narrow self interest.<p>The more complex the legal/transaction structure the wider the attack surface for &quot;opportunism&quot; (because it&#x27;s proportional with deal complexity). In slow and complex deals like M&A at a certain point it becomes an issue and so safeguards are taken.<p>In fast and simple deals like buying stock on the box or what not, the scope is very limited. The glaring example is the broker issue you highlight. But as the deal structure gets more complex, this risk rises.<p>Now, the attack surface for opportunism is proportional to deal complexity as mentioned above. This is legal/structure but also now needs to consider execution and # of counterparties. Limiting counter-parties (ie, middlemen) reduces this &quot;attack surface&quot; (if you will). Because each of them needs to be monitored/paperwork delath with etc. This is why such uncecessary interventions are structured out of deals.

Because, who can trust a government with representing identities, if they are known to mock identities under <i>any</i> circumstances?<p>The capacity to &quot;change the conversation&quot; on a societal level (in this remarkably nefarious manner) represents a tool of which there is ostensibly no oversight -- at least no oversight the People of any democracy should trust.<p>IMHO, there is great naiveté in the assumption that these tools (which are immensely powerful) will continue to be used in an ethical (or legal) manner (without proper oversight).<p>So how can there be proper oversight of a program such as this without ruining its efficacy?  It seems impossible--here we have a catch-22 -- one that draws parallels to the lawsuits filed against metadata collection which couldn&#x27;t proceed because of the lack of legal standing.  In this case, we have an enormously powerful program that can&#x27;t have proper oversight, because then: &quot;how does the government wreck everybody&#x27;s shit?&quot; That&#x27;s power trip logic, but it seems to be the leading rationale in the justification of policy, as well as its advocation. That. Is. Some. Scary. Shit.  Hopefully, in light of the Snowden revelations, the public is more suspicious of the way programs like this will be spun/argued-for.<p>The &#x27;will&#x27; has always existed in government (in fact its pursuit is ubiquitous) to control the public conversation for political purposes--purposes sometimes tangential to the best interests of the democracy.   What happens when entities have access to tools which can be used to propagandize?  They find ways to use them.  History is bound to repeat itself.<p>Take the Red Peril or Red Scare (McCarthyism/J Edgar Hoover, head of the FBI) -- periods spanning several years of Fear-Uncertainty-and-Doubt where the &#x27;societal narrative&#x27; was affected by state propaganda. One of the greatest casualties of the two periods was: Freedom of Speech--strangely, the same cross which is carried by the fighters for an open and uncensored internet.<p>However - these are just the most well known periods of propaganda -- I encourage you read up on Edward Bernays [0], if you&#x27;re interested in the topic. This US government has a long (and official) interest in changing the course of the public conversation through unabashed deceit -- from Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s plight to overcome Isolationism to the pro-Vietnam war-statistics propaganda, and literally countless other incidents.<p>Moral of the story: the desire for state propaganda has shown to be ever-present in the United States, at least over the course of the past century.<p>Is it wise to simply hope to avoid &quot;bad apple&quot; (McCarthy, J Edgar Hoover) scenarios in the NSA/GHCQ/ETC?  Can we risk having such powerful programs operating in complete secrecy.... in perpetuity?<p>&quot;The greatest instrument used in the societal tragedies of the last century has (undoubtedly) been state delivered propaganda.&quot; - The first line of my most upvoted comment on HN.  State propaganda of any kind is the most dangerous medium known to the survival of the enlightened man.<p>Another note on &#x27;capacity&#x27;: while I was not surprised by the &#x27;will&#x27; of intelligence communities to have tools such as these -- the very nature of its operational status (and future development) sheds more light on the vast scope of the programs which have been &quot;realized.&quot;<p>[0] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Bernays</a>",1396664522

7535689,comment,7522343,7528236,3,0,draakon,,,"Those points seemed already covered in the article, but somehow it must have been unclear.<p>First of all, it&#x27;s unlikely to ever have ketamine as a first-line treatment for a depression. Probably more somewhere near electroconvulsive therapy. ECT also has adverse effects which can&#x27;t be considered as minor (e.g. severe memory loss). However, at the same time it&#x27;s recognized as a life-saver for certain population of patients.<p>As I have understood from this research and previous ones, it&#x27;s hoped that the effect of ketamine would be long-lasting: at least up to months. Not so-called daily anti-depressant pill. The adverse effects of ECT would also be more severe if it would be administered on a daily basis. As it was mentioned, some patients relapsed within days, some were free from depression for up to three months.<p>According to animal research[1], it&#x27;s prolonged not acute ketamine use that has shown signs of renal and bladder damage. In a review of ketamine-induced vesicopathy[2] it&#x27;s also noted that &#x27;Very little is known regarding the pathogenesis of its effects on the urinary tract.&#x27; I&#x27;m not claiming that it doesn&#x27;t cause any damage, but that it needs more research and currently there&#x27;s no indication of &quot;renal havoc&quot; after few doses.<p>In light of this, I can&#x27;t even imagine how someone could call possibility of using ketamine for treatment of depression not viable. However, it may be because I know how disabling severe or even moderate depression is and how much damage it causes to person&#x27;s life.<p>Each person reacts very differently to anti-depressants and there&#x27;s large amount of people with treatment resistant depression. It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s silver bullet and because of that we need as many as possible different treatment methods. Depression is life-threatening condition and thus all of those methods can&#x27;t (and don&#x27;t need to) be 100% safe. A lot of approved drugs have serious side-effects. Basically it&#x27;s all about assessing the benefit:risk ratio of a drug. It&#x27;s not rational to cross any treatment out, just because it may have side-effects. Especially if there&#x27;s not reasonable amount research done - like with ketamine.<p>When we have more data, then it may show that certain population would need additional doses of ketamine after 1-3 months and the damage to organs is minor or non-existent in such case. Or it may show something else. It&#x27;s just unthinkable to call it as &quot;not viable&quot; option, yet.<p>[1] Yeung, LY, Rudd JA, Lam WP, Mak YT, Yew DT.
