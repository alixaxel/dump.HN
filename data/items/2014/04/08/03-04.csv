7551337,comment,7539143,7551314,3,0,graham_coop,,,"However, in the calculation above we have ignored the fact that populations are structured, i.e. individuals any where in the world are not equally likely to be your parents. This means going back a few generations in the past individuals in your geographic area may be your ancestors, but individuals in geographically remote areas may likely not be. This means that while in a well mixed population (where individuals) move around a lot the above result will hold, in populations where migration is geographically limited it may take far longer for you to be descended from everyone (who left any descendants).<p>However, some individuals within populations do migrate, and so some individuals in the population will have an ancestor in some distant geographic location in the previous generation. You only need to trace part of your family tree back to one of these migrant individuals in order for you to start having ancestors at geographically distant locations. Given the vast numbers of ancestors you have only a small number of generations back, it is quite likely that you trace your ancestry back to many different migrant ancestors.  In turn these migrant ancestors quickly themselves have many ancestors further back in time, and so your ancestry quickly spreads around the world. Indeed Rhoades, Olsen, and Chang (2004) estimated under some fairly conservative assumptions about human migration that you might well trace your ancestry to everyone in the the entire world (who left descendants) may be just ~three thousand years ago.

7551314,comment,7539143,7542949,4,0,graham_coop,,,"Yes, people have developed simple models to give us some intuition about this question. \nThe first thing to keep in mind is that not everyone at a particular time in the past will leave descendants to the present day. But quite a high proportion of the population will leave descendants to the present day. It&#x27;s been estimated that around 80% of the population at a given time will. So we can ask how long far do we have to go into the past until we can expect everyone in the population (who left any descendants in the present) to be our genealogical ancestor.<p>Your number of ancestors grows very quickly, k generations you have up to 2^k ancestors (2 parents, 4 grandparents etc). So if our population has N individuals in it, we need to go back log2(N) generations until our number of ancestors is on the order of the population size. So even if our population was made up of a billion people it takes only 30 generations (~1000 years) for us to reach the point where it is likely that you are descended from everyone in the population. What’s happening here is that if we go back far enough everyone in the population (who left descendants) is your ancestor many times over (via various routes back through your family tree).

So, every other dark pool in existence, has started with the same premise as Brad and his merry band.  That is, &quot;man our big investors are getting killed due to good pricing in the markets&quot;.  So the first thing they do is come up with a variety of schemes to obfuscate the order flow of these big investors.  Invisible order books, ice berg orders, preferential routing, min. qty. orders etc.<p>These schemes succumb to 1 of 2 problems<p>1) they are trivial to game by market makers.  That is, the exchanges make their money on fees, the market makers make their money on finding inefficiencies in the markets, who is better positioned to find the places that a market protection scheme falls down?  Of course it is the market makers.  This is why you see stories of HFT &quot;pinging&quot; black pools, or creating routing tables, or whatever other wild information advantage that they can come up with.  At the end of the day, big brokers/ibanks still get to eat if their schemes don&#x27;t work, market makers don&#x27;t.<p>2) If an exchange actually does find a way to limit market maker profits, they simply stop trading there.  The liquidity dries up and the dark pool has to figure out some way to justify it&#x27;s existence.  Usually by relaxing their rules and allowing the tricks described in 1) or by negotiating a preferential deal with a couple of HFT firms that have some sort of price protection involved (which may be as shady as, only screw my clients I don&#x27;t care about).<p>Brad, Lewis, and the IETX backers have figured out another strategy.  Convince enough of the &quot;dumb&quot; money to demand that their trades be routed through IEX that they can create a self sustaining dark pool.  They actually don&#x27;t care about retail investors. If a couple of thousand of them call up and demand that their broker get on IETX that&#x27;s fine.  They&#x27;ve made the barrier to entry cheap enough that it doesn&#x27;t cause a lot of overhead.  But what they are really looking for is the uninformed institutional investor.  The East Gary Fireman&#x27;s Booster Union, needs to unload 65k of GOOG that some shady Morgan broker sold them.  They think of IETX first.  There sits Einhorn and his fund ready to hit it for all he&#x27;s worth.  No intelligent liquidity provider there to take any of his execution costs.<p>It&#x27;s sort of brilliant and shows why I&#x27;m a dumb HFT market maker technologist instead of a billionaire (or millionaire in Brad&#x27;s case) Wall Street type.",1396927659

In order to prevent further tension as we as a community move forward (without giving in to the crazy anarchists), the tech community needs to invest in better public transportation solutions available to everyone in the Bay, not just tech employees. We need to adjust the minimum wage in certain counties to facilitate economic growth (again) as a community, rather than focusing it exclusively on tech workers.
