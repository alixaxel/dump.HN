Journey can parse complex regular expressions like `/(app|application)/(:id)+/foo` while router.lua can only handle parameter interpolations (like `/app/:app_id/foo`). We found out that handling parameters was enough for us.<p>That said, the strategy we use is pretty similar: we parse the routes and transform them into a tree, which then allows us to match urls faster.

7650975,comment,7650799,7650799,82,0,jfc,,,"When I first started programming, I could use SO without asking a question because everything I needed to know was fairly basic. It was great because many of the answers I came across helped me to understand more of the &quot;broader universe&quot; of issues I would encounter during development, and so encouraged me to research and learn more about the language.<p>Once I started asking questions, I was careful to respond to comments and accepted and upvoted the best answers. I wanted to be a good citizen of the community. And reciprocity was a part of that: eventually, I found myself able to respond to questions and I remember how great it felt to see the first +25 on my profile because someone accepted my answer.<p>These days, if I ask a question it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve spent a good amount of time on it and haven&#x27;t been able to resolve it myself. Here&#x27;s what happens when I ask a question on SO:<p>1 - I ask the question, post the code, and the error message I&#x27;m getting<p>2 - Question downvoted<p>3 - Respond to comment that says my question is a duplicate (it&#x27;s not, which I clarify to avoid &quot;closed as duplicate&quot;)<p>4 - Respond to comment about a missing semicolon that got deleted when I was cutting/pasting/formatting my code.  (Despite the error msg making it clear that the missing semicolon isn&#x27;t the issue)<p>5 - Question upvoted<p>6 - An answer! Says that I need to read the docs and provides a link to a non-relevant section (I&#x27;ve read the docs)<p>7 - Finally, a helpful answer! Looks pretty good, so I test it out and it does the job. I accept and upvote the answer.<p>8 - Notice a duplicate answer posted less than 1 minute after the accepted answer. Duplicate answer person complains that their entry was posted first. I advise them that the timestamp indicates the other poster was first and they reply that it is a time zone bug.<p>9 - Later I check back and notice this message: &quot;Question closed as vague and cannot be answered&quot;<p>10 - Check back one more time and see that someone has downvoted my question<p>11 - Email the mods to get the downvote removed",1398509445

7650966,comment,7647595,7648468,1,0,otikik,,,"Hi, thanks for sharing.<p>Here are some comments about your module:<p>* Your solution is tied to nginx/openresty. We try to limit our dependencies on the ngx.*  interfaces as much as we can. That way, if changes happen on the ngx.* api, we have less places to &quot;hunt&quot;.<p>* Your module does more than just the routing. That is not a bad thing on itself, but the routing code is coupled with the rest (that is bad)<p>* As I mention in the article, using patterns for matching the urls ends up being messy quite quickly. In apitools we need to handle between 50 and 100 different routes. Handling those without some sort of structured strategy would be maddening. We ended up using routes. Getting the correct matching algorithm was tricky.<p>* Your sinatra module is stateful - the user has to &quot;modify it&quot; (with get and set) in order to use it. We did that before, too. It can cause trouble with nginx&#x27;s workers and global state. We moved to a stateless solution (the library returns a &quot;new router&quot; and you put the changes there instead).",1398509157

Regardless if there is a corporation/LLC/company between the responsible individuals and the people that lost their money.<p>As an example, the responsible individuals of Mt.Gox would need to come up with a repayment plan for every single penny/bitcoin that they still owe. The fact that it was <i>&quot;stolen&quot;</i> from them is irrelevant, as the users entrusted the safekeeping of their money/bitcoin to MtGox. If that means that they will continually have X% of their yearly incomes divied up amongst the users, then so be it. And this will continue indefinitely until the debt has been repaid.<p>Sadly, this sort of solution to the problem would never be instituted in our society. Precisely because it exposes flaws in our concept of the relation between debt and slavery. In essence, it would put the individuals responsible for the fraud in a sort of indentured servitude until the debt has been settled.<p>It does sound like quite a <i>scary</i> proposition, I&#x27;ll be honest.

SO tried some interesting things, but &quot;accepted answers&quot; and the push to accept answers has always sucked. It rewards rapid-fire, crappy responses instead of thorough ones. You&#x27;ll often find people just copying the page summary from Google or some other tiny snippet of text without context so that they could post first and get the &quot;accepted answer&quot; checkmark and the upvotes that come from the short time at the top of the page. Someone else will take 20-30 minutes to type out a thorough, good response that considers ramifications and end up with nothing. There&#x27;s no way to recognize multiple answers, so if multiple answers contain valuable information you have to pick one to favor. There&#x27;s also no way to deprecate answers if new versions break things; the best you can hope for is that the OP will know about the change, remember giving that answer one day, and go back and edit it. You can&#x27;t change acceptances once awarded, and some people will accept answers without even trying them.<p>Those basic flaws in the contrived reputation system have caused problems on SO since day one and deterred many good contributors who weren&#x27;t interested in racing against amateurs who just wanted to copy and paste answers.<p>Second-most damaging imo is the aggressive insistence on moving everything to other StackExchange sites and everything becoming a closed or karmaless (&quot;community wiki&quot;) question on SO. A lot of relevant things were killed off on SO and moved to obscure StackExchanges where they never got a good answer. This deterred contribution, especially on questions that were cross-disciplinary as your question would get stuck in a loop where moderators on SO would say &quot;this should be on SuperUser&quot; and moderators on SU would say &quot;this should be on StackOverflow&quot;. Really it&#x27;d work fine on either. I think that part of why this got so out of hand was another component of the reputation system, that automatically gave those most likely to race to Google and copy and paste the first result moderation powers. If you give people shiny new toys, they&#x27;ll want to use them, and you&#x27;ll end up with a lot of unnecessary infractions being filed and stifling communication.<p>On top of all of that, a large reason SO even gained any popularity in the first place was the star power of Joel Spolsky. With such serious flaws in reputation systems, I&#x27;m honestly not sure that it would&#x27;ve gotten off the ground if not for his association.<p>I don&#x27;t know that SO is ever going to grow out of these problems as they probably now feel their rep system is validated (falsely believing the rep system caused the site&#x27;s success instead of acknowledging that the site is successful despite the rep system), and I think they&#x27;ve just relied on new people entering the groups outlined in this post. I don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;re going to run out of those people anytime soon, but it&#x27;ll be interesting to see what happens.",1398506597

Those users who visit the site to solve their problems, and who like to help others.<p>Like 1 they want to have nice content on the site, but their number one criterion is &quot;is it helpful (and civil)&quot;? They don&#x27;t care much about &quot;is objective/it a good match for SE/constructive&quot; and are frustrated by the wikipedia-like deletionism of 1. They would enjoy and benefit from even the &quot;worst cardinal sin&quot; kind of questions, like &quot;What is the best node.js framework as of early 2014?&quot;. (The question would have many answers and would be a bit messy, but a novice could quickly gauge what frameworks there are, which ones are popular, and around which ones there is controversy.)<p>They dont&#x27;t care much about 2 (&quot;help vampires&quot;), answer the questions if it is not much effort, otherwise ignore them. They don&#x27;t like the term, and absolutely hate it when 1 accuses them of being one. It is incredibly rude when one closes your question for supposedly being &quot;homework&quot;.<p>They don&#x27;t care about 3 (&quot;rep whores&quot;) either, and find the grudge of 1 against 3 silly. Let them have the rep they can get, if they&#x27;re having fun and contributing useful content! Like 3, they enjoy getting rep (or XP), and try to unlock new features on the site, but isn&#x27;t that the point of gamification?<p>Basically, these are the people who also care about the site and the community, but are less obsessive and deletionist (I&#x27;m looking for a less offensive word for anal-retentive...) than the vocal majority on SO and Wikipedia.",1398506456

Plus you&#x27;ve precluded any ability for me to answer with an example as &quot;at that scale&quot; requires something equal or bigger within the limited Q&A space.<p>You&#x27;re basically saying SO system is broken, I say it is not because nobody has done better at that scale. Doesnt mean it is perfect,just mean it&#x27;s the best thing we&#x27;ve come up with yet.You cant prove me wrong on that.<p>And SO is a QandA , it&#x27;s not an image/link/sharing recommendation system, you talk about all these sites and pretend like they play in the same category as SO,that would make them comparable to SO.They are not.",1398506454
