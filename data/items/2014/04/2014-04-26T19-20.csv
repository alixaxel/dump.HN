As you get closer to the base, you start to get a little scared. Half an hour after you start, your legs are already burning and you&#x27;re thinking &quot;wtf am I doing here, I could be having a pint on the patio I passed by earlier!&quot; But you keep on eyes on the path and keep grinding, step by step, one foot in front of the other. Your mind goes blank and you get used to the discomfort. Occasionally you stop to rest and then you see &quot;wow, I&#x27;m actually making progress, this is pretty neat. And the view! This is way better than some random patio.&quot;. You keep going and going for years.<p>Few climbers make it. Mostly you give up and walk back down (ie fail). Sometimes, someone likes your climb and sends a mule to help you on the way back (acquihire) and sometimes they even send a helicoper (product acquisition). And if you make it (IPO), you find out it&#x27;s a fractal game - you always keep climbing, otherwise someone will come from behind and push you over the cliff. :)",1398542070
