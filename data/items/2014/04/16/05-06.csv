7596327,comment,7595098,7596233,5,0,ANTSANTS,,,"I mean, it&#x27;s <i>neat</i> that you can build everything out of cons, in the sense that it&#x27;s neat that Turing machines and the lambda calculus can perform any computation, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s a good idea to so in your code, any more than encoding numbers with Church numerals. Why use alists when you can use hash tables, why use... weird SICP-style struct list things when you could just use structs/vectors, etc.<p>>Hash Tables are part of the Common Lisp Hyperspec so that is a non issue, they have been first class citizens since before Clojure existed (and are nicely integrated into things like loop)<p>I&#x27;m not that familiar with Common Lisp, but a quick search didn&#x27;t reveal a syntax for hash table literals, which I would consider to be a prerequisite for calling them first class citizens. There are other funny uses of lists (not improper ones, but still) in Common Lisp, like named procedure arguments[1]. I guess my point is, why encourage these weird constructs in the first place? Sexps are good at representing recursive structure, tables are good at mapping names to values, why not just have both and let them do what they&#x27;re good at? Obviously Common Lisp is very old and can&#x27;t be changed after the fact, I&#x27;m just trying to imagine the &quot;ideal Lisp,&quot; whatever that is.<p>>Do they really confuse people new to Lisp? car+cdr is a pretty simple concept, when talking to new Lispers they usually don&#x27;t complain about this.<p>I wasn&#x27;t, but I&#x27;ve seen it confuse other people. Either way, it&#x27;s a wart on the syntax that seems out of place in Scheme (not so in Common Lisp, which has lots of other warts ;))<p>>I come from a background using Common Lisp for system and web development so I may see things differently than people who were introduced to it academically.<p>Well, I was introduced to Scheme through SICP, but my motivation for picking it up was more practical than theoretical; I&#x27;d heard all the message board talk, Paul Graham essays, etc. proclaiming Lisp to be the most powerful, productive family of programming languages that will turn you into an <i>expert programmer</i> and so on, and wanted in on that ;) Maybe it&#x27;s more practical to be Getting Shit Done™ instead of worrying about syntactic warts, but I think choosing to not have dotted pairs runs a bit deeper, by forcing the language to promote at least tables to a first class syntactic citizen.<p>[1] For the unfamiliar, it&#x27;s something like:<p><pre><code>  (message &quot;Text&quot; :style bold :color red)\n</code></pre>\nReads pretty well, but it still seems wrong to me (ymmv), like it&#x27;s another spot in the language begging for first class hash tables. In Lua, you&#x27;d emulate named arguments by passing a table to the function. I wonder what Clojure programmers do here. This?<p><pre><code>  (message &quot;Text&quot; {style: bold, color: red})\n</code></pre>\nWhich doesn&#x27;t make a big deal for readability, but I bet if you want to use a macro or whatever accepts named arguments, it&#x27;d be much easier to deal with the one with the real hash table.",1397627517

I could cut 80-90% of them very easily. They just weren&#x27;t very good.

Very good work, and you know you can build a night around them. Then there&#x27;s some that are obviously good enough to screen, if not to be the keystones.<p>Then there&#x27;s the borderliners, and that&#x27;s where you spend all your time. Trying to make those choices. Sometimes it literally comes down to how long a movie is and if it will fit in the slot you have to fill. Sometimes it&#x27;s how a given movie will play off the others you&#x27;ve decided on already. It&#x27;s not completely &quot;fair&quot;, but it&#x27;s how it is sometimes.<p>But you know, even those awful films (and some of them are <i>really</i> awful, worse than you&#x27;ve ever seen)...  They represent a massive amount of work. And perseverance. And dreaming. And I always respected that, and it sucked to reject even the worst. These were people who DID something with their time, and I hated hated hated sending the rejection emails.

When we applied we got to focus on who we are. I can say the YC application was the turning point for us. We built out our vision, I created a website in 10minutes for a landing page and have 2000 members in the waiting list two weeks after that, got some merchants interested in our concept, this was really awesome. We also recruited our first employee. We are on beta, but the fact that we may get our product-which is an MVP out earlier than Clinkle(clinkle.com 30m funding)  without funding has put us on a buzz that YC rejection can hardly put a damper on. Our first rejection was KIMA, so we are getting quite used. We have been brainstormin and have got awesome ideas after every reponse but especially the rejections.\nI  Remember when we started we thought due to Regulations on financial products we would need more that a million dollars. Its shocking to realise that with the right approach we can avoid most regulation, get partners and get our product out there. Nearly 70 merchants have rejected us but we are still making it with 25 merchants signed up! 1 has paid for product despite existence of a trial period, just for training their staff, and an incentive to release the product fast.\nEDITED-got rid of some typos and improved comment clarity",1397626633

Many of the alternative HDLs, such as UC Berkeley&#x27;s Chisel (<a href=""https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chisel.eecs.berkeley.edu/</a>) are designed with the express goal of making it impossible (or at least quite difficult) to write unsynthesizable code.<p>Also, though figuring out what Verilog to write is not difficult if you&#x27;ve properly thought out the microarchitecture, it can be rather tedious and error-prone to actually write it. I&#x27;m not sure how CLaSH works, but Chisel allows you to essentially script generation of hardware using Scala.

This was not a wet-behind-the-ears 25-year-old; he was nearly 50, had finished an Ivy League Ph.D in 3 years, had worked as a professor and a quant on Wall Street, and had both technical chops and deep domain experience.  But while I worked there, I saw him make a bunch of boneheaded technical moves, simply because there was not enough time in the day for him to both keep tabs on the market and understand the technology in enough detail to make informed technological choices.  When I went to the other cofounders about this, they were like, &quot;Well yes, I agree, but it&#x27;s his company, he gets to call the shots.&quot;<p>He kept at it for <i>11 years</i> total.  He called me up a couple years after I&#x27;d quit - not just one job later, but two - to admit that he&#x27;d been wrong about the technology I&#x27;d been complaining about.

Usually that means I start with bash, excluding the obvious cases such as graphics or doing heavy data processing where I know from start that line-based approach isn&#x27;t enough.<p>Then, when bash isn&#x27;t enough, I write the difficult parts in Python as standalone utilities and use those from bash. Consequently, I already have a library of little tools in my ~/bin that are generic enough so that I can just use them from bash right away. But every now and then I need to write a special tool that my bash program can use.<p>Most of my programs &quot;finish&quot; after this stage and they can live for years as a completed bash script calling helper programs. They do their job and there&#x27;s nothing to add. As long as the program continues to &quot;live on&quot; I just make changes to the bash script or the helper programs.<p>If at some point I need features that bash can&#x27;t offer, such as more speed or more complex data processing, I begin to consider rewriting my program in one language. But this is <i>only after the first revision of the program is already complete</i> and I <i>know exactly what to do when porting</i>.<p>Thus, porting the program is initially only about rewriting in another language, not developing it further at the same time. The first months or years of using the bash script turn into a prototyping stage, and this allows my rewrite be concise, well-thought and clear-partitioned.<p>In other words, the rewrite becomes a new stable baseline that contains only the best of my bash prototyping, and only solves a perfectly scoped problem. As soon as the port becomes a drop-in replacement for my original bash program I switch to using it and start a development branch to support the new features, if any. Usually the newly gained speed is enough already.<p>And usually the rewrite happens using C or Scheme. There&#x27;s rarely enough point in rewriting the script in Python which may already be used to some extent in utility programs that the script calls. At that point I don&#x27;t want to extend the program but lift it onto a new platform to cut some old baggage that&#x27;s not needed anymore. There&#x27;s a certain kind of joy rewriting in a new language something that you know completely before hand.
