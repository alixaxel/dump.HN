7550188,comment,7546657,7549408,2,0,ericHosick,,,"> you still need to know what messages a particular object can respond to, don&#x27;t you?<p>Messages don&#x27;t need to know what messages they can respond to as all messages have the same behavioral interface (the &quot;makeItSo&quot; property). Where messages expect certain informational properties (information interface) then, ya, the message would need to check if the message passed to it contains the information it requires (such as a UX layout engine that is waiting for UxControl messages).<p>If you have some time, here are some examples:<p>An example using addition:<p><pre><code>    message Add (\n      left 5\n      right 6\n    )\n</code></pre>\nor it could be<p><pre><code>    message Add (\n      left Subtract ( left 5 right 6 )\n      right 6\n    )\n</code></pre>\nor it could be:<p><pre><code>    message Add (\n      left FromFieldGet ( name &quot;someForm&quot; field &quot;left&quot; )\n      right FromFieldGet ( name &quot;someForm&quot; field &quot;right&quot; )\n    )\n</code></pre>\nIn all these examples, the Add message does not need to know anything about the messages provided to it in the left and right property (5 and 6 are actually messages themselves). The last Add example uses a message FromFieldGet that is able to locate information from a form (in this case named &quot;someForm&quot; with a field left and a field right. The form itself has not been defined in the add example but would also be defined as a message passed to some system that creates the UI/UX which would expected a message of type UxControl).<p>We could code the usage of our message like this:<p><pre><code>   float result = message.asFloat; // the &quot;makeItSo&quot; as a float primitive\n   int result = message.asInt; // the &quot;makeItSo&quot; as an integer primitive\n   string result = message.asString; // the &quot;makeItSo&quot; as a string primitive\n</code></pre>\nOr let&#x27;s use Add in our configuration:<p><pre><code>    message FormFieldSet (\n      name &quot;someForm&quot;\n      field &quot;result&quot;\n      source RunAsFloat (\n        part Add (\n          left FromFieldGet ( name &quot;someForm&quot; field &quot;left&quot; )\n          right FromFieldGet ( name &quot;someForm&quot; field &quot;right&quot; )\n        )\n      )\n    )\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s hook that message up to a ux &quot;button&quot;<p><pre><code>    message Button (\n      action FormFieldSet (\n        name &quot;someForm&quot;\n        field &quot;result&quot;\n        source RunAsFloat (\n          part Add (\n            left FromFieldGet ( name &quot;someForm&quot; field &quot;left&quot; )\n            right FromFieldGet ( name &quot;someForm&quot; field &quot;right&quot; )\n          )\n        )\n      )\n      // properties specific to the layout of a ux element on a form\n    )\n</code></pre>\nand so on.<p>Each message knows nothing about what behavior the messages composed in the properties of the message (100% decoupled) supports.<p>A message oriented language doesn&#x27;t (can&#x27;t) have constructs like for loops, switches, if/then/else, etc. in it as those aren&#x27;t messages if they are integrated into the language. Instead, these are also viewed as messages (first class citizens).<p>A for each statement is also a message:<p><pre><code>    message ForEach (\n      start FromFieldGet ( name &quot;someForm&quot; field &quot;start&quot; )\n      stop FromFieldGet ( name &quot;someForm&quot; field &quot;stop&quot; )\n      action ...\n    )\n</code></pre>\nand so on.<p>If you look at Obj-C, it is really message passing implemented using traditional parameterized subroutines. Smalltalk is a lot more true to it&#x27;s own nature but they still use methods as an abstraction for passing information between systems (For example, they will refer to #do as method as opposed to a message).<p>I think if Alan Kay was forced to implement Smalltalk by focusing 100% on messages (because he was told he couldn&#x27;t use parameterized subroutines) we would have had a much different world today.

How can we liberate these items and put them back into good use? How can we make sharing the new shopping?  This is why yerdle exists.  We help the world exchange second-hand goods for free. 80% of things in our homes are used once per month or less. The average power drill sees 6 minutes of use in its entire lifetime. There&#x27;s 3 billion ft² of self-storage space in the United States. That&#x27;s, like, two San Franciscos of usable stuff—just sitting there.  Yerdle is changing that. People on yerdle give away everything from kid’s clothes to kitchen tools and electronics. And we make it easier to get something re-used rather than buy new. We aim to replace 25% of new purchases with free, second-hand goods from others. In the process, we&#x27;re helping people save money and encouraging manufacturers to make better products.  We&#x27;re looking for people who are passionate about our vision and who want to use their skills to make the world a better place.<p><pre><code>    === Team and Culture ===\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;ve been called &#x27;unrepentant hippies&#x27;—and that&#x27;s fine with us. This is a top-shelf engineering team building a great product in a fast-paced environment. We have developed deep trust and a lot of love as we&#x27;ve worked together. It&#x27;s a close-knit team, we like to pair, and we teach each other every day.  We have solid funding through incredible firms such as The Westly Group and Claremont Creek as well as angels with deep expertise such as Lisa Gansky, Adam Lowry and Andy Rappaport.<p><pre><code>    === Workflow and Process ===\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re agile, we do daily standup, regular one-on-ones and project retrospectives, and we have fun together—rock climbing, surfing, and hanging out after work over beers. As an engineer at yerdle, you&#x27;re more than a coder. You will influence the product&#x27;s direction, bring brilliant ideas and execute them.  We are polyglots, and most of our software is in Ruby, Objective-C, and JavaScript. We love to pair and we often let tests drive our development. And we code small (see our blog: <a href=""http://codesmaller.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codesmaller.com</a>).<p><pre><code>    === Hours and Schedule ===\n</code></pre>\nThe day starts around 9am and we have a standup meeting at 10. We try to schedule any other meetings early or late in the day, so the middle of the day can be a great time to get the meat of the work done. Most people head out around 6pm, but some nights we work a little later. Though yerdle is a 24/7 marketplace and we all have responsibilities in keeping it running smoothly, we try to keep our weekends clear as a time for R&R.",1396910829

Because, again, we&#x27;re talking about mostly CS undergrads here. A very small number of them might have a big impact over the course of a summer, but for the majority of them it is practically charity for these companies to take them on- they&#x27;re not getting anything out of it other than giving a potential future employee some hand-on experience.<p>And, it&#x27;s an employer&#x27;s market- there are plenty of equally qualified interns to choose from in many cases, as well as a small window of time in which they either have to pick an intern or not get one at all.

Typically, the father of a teenager would sign the legal papers, and work out an arrangement with a ship captain, who would not charge the father any money.[10] The captain would transport the indentured servants to the American colonies, and sell their legal papers to someone who needed workers. At the end of the indenture, the young person was given a new suit of clothes and was free to leave. Many immediately set out to begin their own farms, while others used their newly acquired skills to pursue a trade.</i><p>The question of legality would come down to whether it&#x27;s voluntary or involuntary servitude.

The problem is - we are just working around a growing problem. What about the people who already live here. Not just the adults, but the kids who will be in high school and college in a few years.

There aren&#x27;t any real legal obstacles to growing a new system inside the one we have now. For example, you can find pre-written C-corp bylaws online that spell out how a worker co-op functions and the ways it&#x27;s protected from co-option by non-cooperative entities.

Therefore, the memcpy() can read arbitrary data beyond the storage location of the request by sending an arbitrary payload length (up to 64K) and an undersized payload.<p>I find it hard to believe that the OpenSSL code does not have any better abstraction for handling streams of bytes; if the packets were represented as a (pointer, length) pair with simple wrapper functions to copy from one stream to another, this bug could have been avoided.

It is not enough for you to just be quiet, you have to actively and enthusiastically say and write words supporting the &quot;right&quot; opinion. If you have ever expressed the &quot;wrong&quot; opinion in the past, then this is enough to bring punitive action against you, regardless of the current circumstances, though you might win redemption if you make a loud and public declaration of contrition.

The historical fact of your actual behavior is irrelevant to the above.<p>As an exercise, the reader can come up with their own examples for groups and governments that enacted behaviors and policies like the above.

7549888,comment,7548991,7548991,212,0,yaakov34,,,"There was a discussion here a few years ago (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2686580"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2686580</a>) about memory vulnerabilities in C. Some people tried to argue back then that various protections offered by modern OSs and runtimes, such as address space randomization, and the availability of tools like Valgrind for finding memory access bugs, mitigates this. I really recommend re-reading that discussion.<p>My opinion, then and now, is that C and other languages without memory checks are unsuitable for writing secure code. Plainly unsuitable. They need to be restricted to writing a small core system, preferably small enough that it can be checked using formal (proof-based) methods, and all the rest, including all application logic, should be written using managed code (such as C#, Java, or whatever - I have no preference).<p>This vulnerability is the result of yet another missing bound check. It wasn&#x27;t discovered by Valgrind or some such tool, since it is not normally triggered - it needs to be triggered maliciously or by a testing protocol which is smart enough to look for it (a very difficult thing to do, as I explained on the original thread).<p>The fact is that no programmer is good enough to write code which is free from such vulnerabilities. Programmers are, after all, trained and skilled in following the logic of their program. But in languages without bounds checks, that logic can fall away as the computer starts reading or executing raw memory, which is no longer connected to specific variables or lines of code in your program. All non-bounds-checked languages expose multiple levels of the computer to the program, and you are kidding yourself if you think you can handle this better than the OpenSSL team.<p>We can&#x27;t end all bugs in software, but we can plug this seemingly endless source of bugs which has been affecting the Internet since the Morris worm. It has now cost us a two-year window in which 70% of our internet traffic was potentially exposed. It will cost us more before we manage to end it.",1396908170
