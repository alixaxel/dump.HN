The greatest concern are cases in which a loan for an initially large amount is held for a long time after most of the initial amount has been repaid, resulting in interest calculated as a flat percentage of the original amount being applied even though most of it is no longer outstanding with the borrower.  Avoiding such situations is probably the strongest argument for changing from a flat rate to an APR methodology.<p>We have not done so because such cases are not very frequent, and because we judged that the value of having a simple and intuitive cost calculation method outweighed the value of having a more precise model that the majority of our members would not understand in practice.",1396893198

That will give a sense of how many watt-seconds they can hold in that volume.<p>[1] PDF: <a href=""http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/aplmater/1/6/1.4838815.pdf?itemId=/content/aip/journal/aplmater/1/6/10.1063/1.4838815&mimeType=pdf&containerItemId=content/aip/journal/aplmater"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scitation.aip.org/deliver/fulltext/aip/journal/aplmat...</a>",1396892842

7548046,comment,7545319,7545319,3,0,HipHopHacker,,,"Why the elite hacker scene has pretty much disappeared is something I have thought about over the past decade as well.  I know many people from the groups he mentioned in the beginning - mostly the American ones, but also some European, Australian etc. ones as well.<p>Ultimately success is what killed it off I&#x27;d say.  I recognize some HN names as people who were actively, or at least peripherally involved in the scene, hanging out on EFnet&#x27;s +hack and then #hack etc.  Many of these people went into dot-coms and startups from the mid-1990s on.  Some sold their companies for billions of dollars, many got tens of millions of VC dollars, or stock options, or buyout dollars, or whatnot.  As someone mentioned in the thread for this post, Mudge became a program manager at DARPA - some people went into the security field, and thrived.<p>Aside from the financial/career success of the dot-com boom, the growth of the Internet helped kill it off as well.  Prior to the Internet, a very technical working class kid would take his Commodore 64 hooked up to the family TV, plug it into his POTS phone line with his 300 (then 1200, then 2400...) baud modem, and call a Bulletin Board Service, which inevitably was a Commodore 64 or Apple ][ belonging to another technical teenager, whose class background might be slightly tonier as he often had a dedicated phone line in his room.<p>So what kind of social structures evolve when the kind of kids who gather on 4chan today get together on this network of Commodore 64&#x27;s that are fairly independent of everyone else?  One thing is for sure, to take a page from this fellow&#x27;s essay, all of the rules and structures that make up American society with its class structures and relations, large international military and police force and so forth go out the window.  If the kids want access to a Cray, they&#x27;re going to get access to a Cray.  They don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s used for some secret DoD research project, or some Goldman Sachs number crunching.  These were the days when your local Bell switch might be on a dialup, when a tone-generating blue box could seize hold of the telephone company&#x27;s in-band signalling.<p>So some of this fits into what the essay writer says.  We had our own communication network, a kind of 4chan&#x27;ish network of Commodores and Apple ][&#x27;s in teenage boys bedrooms across America.  We controlled it.  When the Internet came, we shifted to that, but our communication network became controlled by DARPA, then the NSF, then a variety of corporations, which were then whittled down to a handful - AT&T, Verizon, Centurylink, Sprint, Comcast, Time-Warner and several more.  The network became corporatized, firewalled, censored, monitored, spammed and spam-resisted etc.  Under the threat of spam, attorney generals and corporate control tightening, Usenet effectively disappeared.  The disappearance of Usenet is tied to the disappearance of the hacker scene.  The same forces which killed Usenet are the forces which killed the scene.  Understand why Usenet died and you understand why the scene died.<p>The carrot is what killed it, not the stick.  In 1990 Operation Sundevil happened, the MoD guys were arrested etc.  Repression didn&#x27;t really kill things, it just made people a little more careful.  Maybe the arrested guys would quit, but everyone else just started buying early cell phones and such to hack outside their house.<p>The Internet killed it.  It swallowed up the need for a network of BBS&#x27;s in boy&#x27;s bedrooms.  It swallowed its own Usenet via monopolization, shady corporations doing spam, attorney generals and such.  It also started a dot-com boom and then social boom and now mobile/cloud boom.  A teenage boy can publish a traction-getting app or website for next to nothing in a way that could never have happened back then.  Some of the scene people from the 1980s and 1990s are very, very wealthy Tesla-owning retired founder dudes nowadays.",1396892755

Not even sure if this is possible, but I&#x27;ve heard of watches that can recharge their batteries from body heat. You know how expensive and annoying it is to buy batteries for a hearing aid?<p>* A better credit report system than Experian/TransUnion/etc. The current system is flawed on a number of levels -- not the least being that someone can file a claim against you and you have very little recourse. Something with a little more accountability and a little less emphasis on distant history. For instance, if two years ago I lost my job and fell behind on bills, but now I&#x27;ve had a steady job for a year and have been paying down my debt, that shouldn&#x27;t rule me out for buying a car or a house. In other words, just because I might have been financially unstable in the past does not mean I&#x27;m financially unstable now.<p>* a HUD for subtitles/closed captioning on TVs, so hearing people don&#x27;t have to see subtitles while deaf/hard of hearing people can see them. This would be especially awesome in movie theaters.<p>* A Fitbit clone that actually figures out what I&#x27;m doing, rather than just counting steps. (For example, it knows my height/weight/gender, and it knows that I took X steps in Y minutes, so it should be able to calculate Z pace and conclude that I&#x27;m running.)<p>* Something that makes tracking caloric consumption EASY.

Which one of these is the most analogous to what I just ate? At this point, I&#x27;m just guessing, right? So make an app that makes those guesses for me. &quot;What&#x27;d you eat today, Jemaclus? On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being super healthy, how healthy do you consider what you just ate?&quot; Then check out all the values for macaroni and cheese, identify the options that most closely match the health scale I gave, run some calculations, and come back with an estimate on what I ate. If at the end of the day you say &quot;You ate somewhere between 1900 and 2150 calories today,&quot; that&#x27;s better than saying &quot;You ate exactly 1937 calories today,&quot; when honestly, I was just guessing about those portions to begin with.",1396892630

All data encrypted client side and sent to system only in encrypted form<p>2. Anonymous<p>3. Distributed (no single point of failure for DDOS attacks or subpoenas)<p>4.

When once formed, a relation is created between the parties which they cannot change, and the rights and obligations of which depend not upon their agreement, but upon the law, statutory or common. It is an institution of society, regulated and controlled by public authority.

Nebraska (1923)<p>&quot;While this Court has not attempted to define with exactness the liberty thus guaranteed, the term has received much consideration and some of the included things have been definitely stated. Without doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint, but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.&quot;<p>Skinner v. Oklahoma (1942)<p>&quot;But the instant legislation runs afoul of the equal protection clause, though we give Oklahoma that large deference which the rule of the foregoing cases requires. We are dealing here with legislation which involves one of the basic civil rights of man. Marriage and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival of the race. The power to sterilize, if exercised, may have subtle, far-reaching and devastating effects. In evil or reckless hands, it can cause races or types which are inimical to the dominant group to wither and disappear. There is no redemption for the individual whom the law touches. Any experiment which the State conducts is to his irreparable injury. He is forever deprived of a basic liberty.&quot;<p>Griswold v. Connecticut (1965)<p>&quot;We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights -- older than our political parties, older than our school system. Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred. It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects. Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.&quot;<p>etc.<p>So it&#x27;s actually a modern assertion that gay-marriage is not allowed by law as &quot;marriage&quot; in the general sense has been recognized and reinforced numerous times, without specificity as to the nature of the parties involved. It&#x27;s the modern dawning realization by parties wishing to marry and being denied, and by parties wishing to deny them, that the scope of who can marry is largely unconstrained.<p>Persons against gay-marriage are actually in a battle to <i>contract</i> the existing right, while persons for gay-marriage are looking for explicit confirmation that they are included in the right. Given the general trend of rights expansion over American history, it&#x27;s unlikely that an argument to contract an existing right will win without a general rewrite of several Constitutional Amendments (privacy, due process, etc.) explicitly naming the minority class that they wish to specifically oppress.",1396891964

Every output frequency coefficient contains a full sum of the input function, hence a direct translation of that formula is O(n^2) -- which is why the FFT, with O(nlogn) complexity is so important.<p>The graphic doesn&#x27;t really help show how the analysis itself happens, it just presents the result, which is a series of waves that add up to f. The actual process of obtaining a frequency coefficient from a time-domain function is easy to describe: multiply the function by a (co)sine wave with a particular frequency and sum together the result. But it&#x27;s not very intuitive why that works until you consider that one period of a sine wave sums to zero. By multiplying the sine with the function, you perturb the shape of the sine with just the amount of energy that the function contains at that given frequency. So that instead of summing to zero, the sum measures &quot;how much&quot; of that particular wave is present. That&#x27;s Fourier analysis.<p>Fourier synthesis is more easily visualized (I think anyway). Simply multiply a sine wave at each frequency by the corresponding coefficient derived above, and sum those weighted waveforms together elementwise to recover your function.",1396891957

I would like to take a moment to thank all of the Beta users who participated in Beta 2, you all have been a huge help in finding issues with Draftin&#x27; that I did not find myself. In Beta 2, you guys/gals uncovered an array of bugs which have been patched, along with usability issues around user interaction and menu/GUI simplicity which have been fixed/updated.<p>Anyway, I have been taking a more <i></i>community oriented<i></i> approach to Draftin&#x27;s continued development. Basically, I am letting the users give large input as to what they would like to see in Draftin&#x27;, and I have been prioritizing development based on that input. Beta 3 is entirely community driven, consisting of all the most reported issues/bugs. Hopefully Beta 3 brings a much more well rounded and bug free drafting experience!<p>#### Beta 3 contains the following updates<p>- Add flashing tab on various events throughout Draftin&#x27; if user is on another web page/tab.\n- Play audible sound on various events throughout Draftin&#x27; if user is on another web page/tab.\n- Fix UI issues in <i></i>My Cards<i></i> section where card rows are out of sync.\n- Make user profile display users cards. If you ever leave a draft/the coordinator deleted the draft, you can now retrieve your last drafts cards from your profile.\n- Greatly improved Set selection UI.\n- Fix server error when users try to join the same draft twice.\n- Fixed issues with kicking users from a draft.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s all for Beta 3. I am calling this update a usability update as it touches on the main issues you all found in Draftin&#x27;. I hope everybody enjoys the updates and continues to help push this little MTG draft simulator towards dev complete!<p>If you like this tool or have suggestions then feel free to leave them here. :)",1396891703

When you turn it off it writes its whole memory (incl. framebuffer) out to disk, which I think is the only thing on the disk actually, and when you turn it on it reads it back in to memory. So it never had any concept of a file, of saving a file, or opening a file.  Saving a document was just saving your state, which includes the document, and opening a document was leaping to that part of the screen.<p>You could migrate your session by just carrying the disk with you.<p>The tabulating and (re)calculating thing is slick, and I think the Swyft might have provided that feature too.

7547880,comment,7541601,7543353,1,0,sparkie,,,"I&#x27;d like to see arbitrary graph based systems where there&#x27;s no restriction on the relationships you can create - although doing so takes more work than dumping things into hierarchies. Tag based systems are useful for making the transition to graphs, but they&#x27;re really just &quot;patching&quot; graph-like semantics onto trees - as are things like symbolic links in file systems.<p>Relationships are largely arbitrary, and what is meaningful to one person may not be to another. In order to have an effective system, I think it would need both a distributed and local component, such that there is this large, distributed graph of knowledge of relationships, which you can download and cache parts of selectively - and which you can add your own relationships to, and chose which of those you wish to share. By collectively sharing relationship, we can form consensus models which converge around specific kinds of ontologies - which could be used to optimise storage and querying for local caches of such boundaries.<p>My biggest gripe is perhaps this idea of bottom-up-schema creation, in which we try to conjure up a model of relationships which may work based on our limited knowledge of the models we want to express. Instead, the graph based approach gives us a top-down-approach, where all the relationships are visible, but where we focus on specific relationships to build an ontology, then optimise our problem around it.<p>Filesystems in the traditional sense are far too limiting in that they already push a bottom-up schema on you - that of files, and much of the data you want to organize isn&#x27;t files anyway. The filesystem is useful though, and necessary to remain compatible with existing systems - but I think it should take the top-down approach, where for example, you&#x27;d have some FUSE module which accesses part of a larger graph database, and only cares about the file specific relationships or ontologies.<p>I&#x27;m no expert on graph theory, and I&#x27;ve only played around with the ideas a bit using existing graph databases (Titan, Orient, rel etc) and querying languages like Gremlin and Datalog. I also have a few dozen databases I&#x27;ve made with Postgres in order to map the relations I care about with refeences to external information sources (e.g musicbrainz) - some of which are not &quot;open&quot; in the sense that you&#x27;d want them in a distributed system, because they require sign-ups to central services in order to manipulate them.<p>I&#x27;ve also looked at various attempts to build systems like this, but the majority are proprietary systems, or centralized in some way or another, and I&#x27;ve not discovered a sane way to locally cache the data I want without taking whole copies of the databases.<p>At present there&#x27;s just too much for me to learn and research, and not the time or motivation to do it - partly because I feel it would need to be a collaborative, free software project, as the profit motive is largely incompatible with the need for a distributed system - and I&#x27;m too focused on making a living right now.",1396891440

(We are not yet supported by any major foundations.)  There are two main reasons we have not done so:<p>1. As a small nonprofit with limited financial resources, one of the measures we&#x27;ve adopted to ensure that we always have enough cash to cover our costs as we grow is to couple service fees closely with actual expenditures.  There was historically a large up-front cost to admitting new borrowers, as we used to contract with local partners to verify applicants&#x27; credit histories with local lenders.  We no longer work with local verification partners, but even today there is an up-front cost in Skype and SMS charges, as we verify the information of new borrowers with local contacts.  Coupling registration fee income with the cost we incur to admit new borrowers ensures we will always have enough revenue to cover our costs, regardless of the pace at which Zidisha grows.<p>2.  Shifting a portion of the costs borrowers pay to join Zidisha to a lifetime membership fee paid up front makes strengthens the incentive to participate responsibly with Zidisha over the long term, because costs of borrowing decrease as members build up a track record of on-time repayments over time.",1396891178

Instead of attempting to recreate the shell in C# or Java&#x27;s supplied libraries and subsequently becoming frustrated when interaction with the &quot;outside world&quot; is clumsily accomplished through a FFI pinhole, just use the shell as it was intended: as a lingua franca between utilities.\n Write what requires prolog in prolog, what requires c in c, what requires awk in awk, etc.  Use flat file databases such as starbase or /rdb and avoid data prisons such as MSSQL, Oracle, MySQL, etc.  Make all of these utilities return sane return values and spit out JSON formatted output. Finally, tie it all together with shell.

Recode in a lower level language only when needed.<p>Weighing the tradeoffs of adding language features is a sign of a false dilemma; rather than a single <i>bigger</i> or <i>smaller</i> language, what is actually needed are <i>more</i> specific languages which speak to each other through a lingua-franca.  Tcl accomplishes this communication through a string representation, Powershell through an object representation, etc.  Again, rather than choosing one solution over another, use them <i>all</i> where they work best.  This is where Unix got it right all those years ago; Unix isn&#x27;t just a slightly more stable platform for running today&#x27;s bloated and monolithic software, rather, it&#x27;s an elegant system for connecting maintainably-small utilities.
