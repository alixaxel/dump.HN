7551477,comment,7551232,7551232,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Brett, this is total nonsense. What you&#x27;ve written here (without any sources) is only true for a tiny handful of high-end superstar DJs vs stadium rock bands. Some of it just seems completely off-base, like your claim that electronic music shows cost much more than others (complete BS IMHO) and equally your assumption that all electronic music is done on laptops (possible, but very far from being universally the case). There wasn&#x27;t anything in there about stuff like merchandise sales, which are a major source of ancillary income for rock & pop bands but which are mostly a non-starter for electronic musicians.<p>Electronic musicians don&#x27;t rent recording studios like rock bands, but that&#x27;s because they have studios of their own, which costs money. You can make great rock music with cheap gear, and while prices of guitars, drums etc. can get very expensive, guess what, so do high-end synthesizers and other gear. Again, it&#x27;s nice to think that you can do everything on a laptop, but good luck making a a dance-floor or radio friendly electronic track on a set of laptop speakers - for serious work you still need a good audio interface and headphones and speakers at a minimum. And the more minimal your setup, the more likely that getting it released is going to require a trip to an expensive mastering studio.<p>Sorry, but it sounds like you don&#x27;t know a whole lot about music production or music business economics.",1396932406

We can&#x27;t undo the mistake that has been made, so the best we can do is find a way to phase it out in a way that allows the market to recover from rent control, but preserve the expectations of those that have come to rely on it. The city needs to increase the supply of housing and the way rent control currently works acts like a lock on a database. The city currently has ~175000 locks on n properties that are essentially undevelopable until you remove all the locks on the property.<p>I don&#x27;t want rent control. I, and even most people with rent control, would actually be far better off in a parallel universe where San Francisco had never had rent control. Only those who have been in a property for decades actually benefit. The majority pay far more than they should be for the first couple of years and then in later years end up paying roughly what they would have in the parallel universe where rent control had never happened.<p>Furthermore, if you lifestyle changes and you want to raise a family, you&#x27;ve fucked yourself out of the market you love because you can&#x27;t afford anything in the market by the time you decide you might want something different. When someone moves into a rent control place, they effectively check out of the housing market like an ostrich with their head in the sand. Basically, had they been back in the housing market every few years as their housing needs and expectations changed, they would have demanded more housing supply in the city. Rent control permits people to remain blissfully ignorant of the housing situation until one day something happens that causes them to be out of their unit such as an Ellis Act eviction. At that point I think to myself &quot;boo hoo&quot;, because if they really wanted to live in a city forever they would have either bought property back when they first moved here or they would have demanded increased housing supply long ago so that they would never find themselves in a housing market they were priced out of. People who argue for rent control are downright selfish, since they basically get the benefits of a scarce good without any of the sacrifice (like saving for a down payment) and actively prevent developments which would reduce the scarcity so that others just like them that arrive later may also enjoy the benefits of living in a city like San Francisco.",1396932312

7551468,comment,7551276,7551351,1,0,waps,,,"Islam is a really bad example, since it&#x27;s an extremely late entry in the whole history of God, as such it is not a good basis to study the God concept at all. If you want to scientifically validate the existence of an eternal God it makes a lot of sense to go for the oldest sources, and the oldest sources are the pentateugh (the first 5 books of the bible). There is precious little evidence the quran as a book even existed before the 19th century (some stories can be traced back to ~800 AD, but they are copies of pages of the Arameic bible, they are not unique to the quran. Also the national library of Turkey and some organisation in Baghdad claim to have older qurans but they won&#x27;t show them to anyone. Several articles by an ex-keeper of that book in Turkey indicate that this is because there are significant differences). Despite how arabic script looks, arabic is actually not that far removed from greek (as in there exists a literal transliteration between arabic and greek that reduces the language difference to vocabulary, more or less). The older qurans aren&#x27;t even in Arabic, they&#x27;re kufic (which is a dialect of Arameic, and &quot;just happens&quot; to be the dialect a significant part of the bible is written in. Long story short : the quran is an especially badly made copy of the Arameic new testament with significant amended by a successful warlord with Jewish heritage)<p>But if you look at real early texts you will find no mention of God. So how do you arrive from the early books to God ? Well, easy : anything expressed in one of the passive tenses refers to God(s) (except where it really doesn&#x27;t make sense). Meaning in the really old portions of the bible (we actually have old versions of the bible, in contrast to the quran), you will not find a sentence like &quot;God made it rain&quot;, instead you will find &quot;It was raining&quot; and that is currently getting translated using God. There are other factors that make matters even more confusing.<p>Even in competing religions&#x27; texts you will find this. The Greek religions for example also do this. Until the late Roman republic you almost never find any reference to direct action of  any of the Greek/Roman Gods. Rather you will find references that look a lot like today&#x27;s &quot;lady luck was smiling on him&quot;. In stories you will find that, for example, a king &quot;felt inspired by Ares&quot;, which I&#x27;m sure you can translate for yourself. Or &quot;Ares smiled on the king&#x27;s forces&quot;, indicating he won (note that Greek/Roman Gods were not really part of a pantheon. They are more like &quot;patron saints&quot; of specific families or other groups of people. For example, when there&#x27;s a battle between Sparta and Athens, either Ares &quot;smiles&quot; or Athena does, meaning this indicates which side won (extremely confusing the first time you read that. You read a story of a battle, with lots of descriptions of fights between generals, heroes, etc. Then suddenly &quot;Ares smiled&quot; and it starts describing logistics of returning the army to the Greek mainland. First time you&#x27;ll be sitting there &quot;wait, wasn&#x27;t there a battle ? How did it end ?), and Greek/Roman gods were probably understood to be the personality of a particular city state (or states). The pantheon in Rome is simply meant to indicate an alliance between specific families/states).",1396932176

7551464,comment,7545248,7550423,1,0,vinceguidry,,,"Well, to be fair, I didn&#x27;t have Helvetica available at the time I developed my hatred of Arial to compare. And when I look at blown-up / high res versions of Arial text now on my spiffy MacBook screen, they don&#x27;t look so bad. But looking at old screenshots of Win3.1 still draws my ire. Verdana would have made Windows look so much better had they made that the main OS sans-serif. Arial&#x27;s just so... pedestrian.<p>It may have had much more to do with the fact that Win 3.11 had shitty text display than with any real problem with Arial. But Arial really did look horrendous to my eyes compared to Verdana, on the same machine. I do think that had I had access to Helvetica back then I would have liked it more. But without a time machine it&#x27;s impossible to tell.<p>I also grew up with computers and started looking at text on screens from the fourth grade. I&#x27;d had a long time to develop my eye for type by the time I was writing papers in high school. I could look at a page of printed text and tell which (Microsoft) font it was using, I doubt many kids back then could. I do think I&#x27;d have been able to tell Arial from Helvetica. There are quite a few differences between the two. Enough that my practiced eye would be able to tell the difference. Not that my programming day job affords me much practice in that regard.",1396932102

Even comparisons missing stronger types showing &quot;this thing is null terminated vs that is not&quot; can be eliminated if you just create enough definitions for the type-system to defend your own interests.

Both good things for me.<p>That being said, I think the more time in apps vs mobile web might be a bit misleading. How many apps out there have webviews taking you to the web for various reasons? I can only imagine this time is counted as app time for the graph in the article, but it&#x27;s really web time for all intents and purposes.<p>And frankly, I think that this is a much better user experience in a lot of ways. the facebook native app is much better than the web version is and even really could be (at least at this point). Much of what happens in that app though is clicking on websites to random articles around the web, and that is done in a webview inside the app. I like the app over the website, and i definitely don&#x27;t want it to kick me out to safari while I&#x27;m in the app. This is a good ux, but I think it skews the data in this article. How many other apps have similar functionality?<p>All that being said, I strongly prefer the experience of native apps over the web, but I&#x27;m only interested in using the app if it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m going to use all the time. If I need your site 1 time ever, I&#x27;m not wasting time downloading the app. If I use it every day, I absolutely would rather have an app. For everyone saying &quot;Hell no I don&#x27;t want your app&quot;, I suspect the above is actually true for a significant majority of people. 1 time use people don&#x27;t want app. Repeated use people do want app.",1396929810
