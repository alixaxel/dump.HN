7657130,comment,7641114,7643324,1,0,fmx,,,"> I think the problem in the end is the narrowing definition of normal behavior.<p>Not exactly. The problem is that anything outside that narrow definition is seen as &quot;illness&quot;.<p>If you instead see it as a different, but equally valid, way of perceiving the world then the fact that so many people seem to have ASD, ADD or other &quot;D&quot;s makes much more sense.<p>This is not a matter of politically correct terms - I&#x27;m talking about a genuine difference in attitude. ASD is a very broad spectrum. Some people on it really do have an &quot;illness&quot; in the sense that they cannot function independently. Others are just a bit &quot;different&quot; and you may never even know they&#x27;re not normal unless you happen to see them at their worst. Is it still worth diagnosing those? Generally, yes, because it allows them to get the help they need when they need it or, at least, understand themselves better, so they can help themselves.",1398635988
7657129,comment,7656263,7657014,7,0,xaritas,,,"It&#x27;s not like django-cms or various PHP-based CMS (Conrete5 comes to mind) where a template defines &quot;slots&quot; into which an administrator can drop different type of content widgets. In spirit, it&#x27;s much more like Mezzanine, where each Page has a particular type and an associated template. Your page is just a Django model, so if you want three areas for text, an image, and a caption, you&#x27;ll have a model which has three TextFields, a CharField, and an ImageField.<p>(Having said that, the rich text editor is in Wagtail really is rich and can support inserting images from the image library and links to documents in the document library, as well as oEmbed stuff, so it has some wriggle room).<p>The two schools of thought (&quot;each page is designed ahead of time with structured content in mind&quot; vs &quot;each page is a collection of content objects&quot;) have their adherents. Personally I prefer the Wagtail and Mezzanine approach, but the right answer depends on what the client needs and the nature of your relationship with them.",1398635981

7657116,comment,7654392,7654392,2,0,Fr0styMatt,,,"Worked on a .NET app with lets of C# and C++ interop and we were seeing what looked like a rare race condition.  The bug was hard to repro and never seemed to happen in our dev environment (like all great bugs!).  The native code would just trigger access violations and we couldn&#x27;t figure out what triggered it.  We ended up getting extremely lucky and getting to a point where the bug started happening on my dev machine while I was running the app under a specific profiling tool.<p>It turned out we were racing the .NET garbage collector when passing a reference off to some native code.  The variable being used by the native code would be collected by .NET as it determined that we no longer needed the variable when we were still actually using it.  A classic .NET interop mistake that was fixed by wrapping the use in a &#x27;using&#x27; clause.  The reason we didn&#x27;t see it while developing was that .NET garbage collection is different between Debug and Release builds (Debug builds extend the lifetimes of all variables so that they live for the entire length of the function they are used in; Release builds optimize for the shortest variable lifetime).<p>Another time, had a crash that seemed to occur after a consistent time period.  The crash was in third-party code that we didn&#x27;t have the source for.  It &#x27;kind of&#x27; behaved like a memory leak, except that everything was telling us the app&#x27;s memory usage was normal.<p>After several weeks almost tearing my hair out over it, I ended up setting a breakpoint in the third-party lib using WinDbg and using PageHeap on the app while it was working in order to see who owned the memory that the third-party library was trying to write to.  That lead us to a line of code that was performing a malloc() without checking the result; then sending that off to the third party library for use later.  The malloc failed, neither us nor the third-party library checked for the NULL and the third-party lib wouldn&#x27;t try to use the memory until later.<p>We eventually determined that we were seeing heap fragmentation causing the malloc to fail; we found that under certain conditions we&#x27;d leak small objects.  Again WinDbg and other tools came in handy; they DID report high address space fragmentation, but it took us a long time to put the two things together.  WHen we fixed the small object leak, the crash in the third-party library went away.<p>So classic bugs in hindsight, but they certainly taught us how awesome WinDbg can be (along with the other excellent debugging facilities provided by Windows).  In the end, well worth the time investment in learning.",1398635798

7657111,comment,7656879,7656879,23,0,tikhonj,,,"It&#x27;s funny, because I have completely the opposite view: stop telling people stuff is difficult! If people think what they&#x27;re about to learn is supposed to be &quot;hard&quot;, they&#x27;re going to give up faster and be intellectually lazy. &quot;Oh, I just can&#x27;t figure it out because it&#x27;s <i>hard</i>.&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve found this to be particularly important with things that are fundamentally simple but very abstract. You can teach people quite a bit of advanced mathematics if you don&#x27;t tell them it&#x27;s supposed to be difficult; but if you start out by mentioning that it&#x27;s graduate-level algebra or something, they just shut down and don&#x27;t even try.<p>I think this is a big part of the &quot;monad problem&quot;, coincidentally. People don&#x27;t understand monads because everyone says they&#x27;re impossible to understand. When I came at them, I expected something complex and obscure. I couldn&#x27;t see their actual simplicity—they have a <i>tiny</i> definition, after all—because of my expectations. On the other hand, when I went to learn about arrows, which are a similarly abstract concept, I didn&#x27;t have nearly the same difficulties because I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything and could take the definition as it is. I had a decent understanding of arrows before a decent understanding of monads, which is a shame because I don&#x27;t really like arrows!<p>Now, I suppose that this doesn&#x27;t mean you should call everything &quot;easy&quot;, but you should definitely <i>not</i> perpetuate the idea that things are difficult!

7657109,comment,7653013,7654887,1,0,briantakita,,,"> They might argue historically by noting that Haskell builds upon 30 years of PL research while Javascript is lightly influenced by one<p>Javascript, since it has not &quot;evolved&quot; over a long period of time, is more of a blank slate & more flexible in it&#x27;s semantics. It does not force you into a particular tradition, so you are free to develop your own semantics. There is much life into what you can do. It&#x27;s up to the programmer to evolve the practice.<p>I&#x27;d like to explore the root of our differences. I have a hard time assimilating deep traditions. I respect my autonomy as an individual & creative being.<p>I prefer to be directly exposed to the problem and create solutions & practices based on that. I can&#x27;t blindly follow a teaching or tradition. I&#x27;m always questioning.<p>There are advantages & disadvantages to this. A disadvantage is I may be repeating mistakes that others have already done. In my case, I have a hard time fully appreciating other&#x27;s mistakes because I was not presented with the same situation. Group oriented developers tend to despise this &quot;independent&quot; approach because it does not follow already established conventions. I&#x27;ve gone years with the mindset of if it&#x27;s not a standard approach, then the code is &quot;unmaintainable&quot;. I have since evolved to realize that code is like an interactive story or engine. If you can clearly express intent & purpose and there&#x27;s automated verification (testing, type systems, etc.), then it&#x27;s maintainable.<p>Advantages to this &quot;independent&quot; approach are it&#x27;s easier to assimilate the good parts of multiple traditions. You can also reject the legacy overhead of a particular tradition. Like how Bruce Lee rejected the extraneous movements of Kung Fu when he created Jeet Kune Do, which is an assimilation of Kung Fu, Karate, Boxing, Fencing, etc. The approach is &quot;Absorb what is useful, discard what is useless&quot;. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeet_Kune_Do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeet_Kune_Do</a><p>Bruce Lee, like most true innovators, was criticized by his contemporaries. However, when the rubber hit the road, he kicked everybody&#x27;s ass.<p>That can be great when there are 1 to a few programmers with a like mindset. I prefer to be in such environments. It can be quite difficult in projects with large teams. I don&#x27;t like such environments. Politics become necessary & it feels dehumanizing.",1398635722

And saving up 6 months salary doesn&#x27;t happen overnight. Reality is reality.<p>On the other side of the coin, it&#x27;s just numbers. If you can justify, say, a $4K/week rate, charge $4.5K standard or $4K for upfront. If the customer is in a position to bend payment terms to save $500/week, they can, and you&#x27;re now in line with market rate but more favorable payment terms. If they&#x27;re not in a position to do so, $500/week probably doesn&#x27;t matter one way or the other to them, anyway. Either way, you win.<p>Most customers will ask for a discount, as a rule. Hinge that discount on something you want (faster payment) instead of just giving it to them. Then they can make the decision. Either way, they feel good about it.

Normal folks commuted by bus too. However, there were also quite a few who we were &quot;challenged&quot; in various ways, but still had regular jobs at cafes and such. Since my commute schedule was fixed, I became familiar with them and realized that though there wasn&#x27;t much conversation going on, the regulars were all familiar with each other.<p>On one occasion, one guy sat next to me and poured his heart out about how his girl friend ditched him years ago and how upset he&#x27;s been over it for many years. Then, when a stop came, he wordlessly walked out the door and held it open for one of the regulars. This lady had her eyes to the floor the whole time and after she&#x27;d got down, said &quot;bye&quot; to him. He returned a &quot;take care&quot;, came back to his seat and resumed his story with me.<p>I admit I was somewhat uneasy on the bus commutes initially, but this incident totally changed me. Actually, I&#x27;d never seen this quality of spontaneous kindness among &quot;normal&quot; folks during my stay there .. and was humbled greatly myself.<p>I always recall this incident (and all those commutes) fondly.

So you can quickly reach some conclusions with this type of study, but they might just reinforce what people already believed rather than tell you what is actually true.<p>In a &quot;prospective&quot; study, you look at the present - for instance, you could ask a group of people to keep a food journal, measure their health at regular intervals, encourage some of them to make some changes, and see if the advice ends up making them healthier. The advantage is that you have MUCH more accurate data. The disadvantage is: (a) you have to wait many years before you can reach any conclusions, (b) most of the time the conclusion you discover is that the advice didn&#x27;t help.<p>Retrospective studies can generate hypotheses but you have to TEST those hypotheses with prospective studies.",1398633742

If you insert with a numeric key (or a string that&#x27;s strictly a number), I believe the JS engines don&#x27;t agree on the order in which the numeric key will be enumerated in relation to the alphanumeric ones (v8 and spidermonkey will put the numeric ones ahead of all the keys, sorted ascending, then do the rest in insertion order, for instance).",1398632855

If your band wasn&#x27;t touring with one of their desks you hadn&#x27;t yet made it.<p>The company developed a new desk and sold the first couple.

I ran backstage to get my tools to open the desk (god knows why I&#x27;d left them there), pelted back to the desk, and on the way I realised what must be going wrong. It must have been the adrenalin that heightened the thought processes. Opened the desk, moved the component that I&#x27;d worked out was shorting to ground and causing the output to stop, and he was back in business before the intro tape had finished.<p>I still get a bit of a high when I think about the total head rush of fixing that problem like that.<p>The &#x27;permanent&#x27; fix for him was a tiny piece of gaffer tape under the component.
