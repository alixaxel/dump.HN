The fun thing will be when they&#x27;ll realize that this is exactly what FP can bring :) ...less side-effects means less time for a programmer to &quot;load a codebase-part into his working memory&quot; and start working productively on a new project he&#x27;s never seen before.<p>And as a programmer too I tend to like languages that make me replaceable: it&#x27;s always fun to be able to jump from one project to another and be able to quickly &quot;load it in your mind&quot;. Paradoxically, both &quot;retarded OOP&quot; languages like Java, &quot;retarded dynamic&quot; languages like Javascript and &quot;fundamentalist&quot; languages like Haskell give you this.

With the recent exponential growth of vulnerabilities and backdoors, people are talking about moving to more secure languages like Haskell and Rust, installing airgaps, etc. But when you think about it, why does it matter? Look how &quot;vulnerable&quot; credit cards are, every time you use with a new vendor, you increase the risk that one of those vendors will take all your money. But this never actual is a problem in practice because the credit card company actually knows you in person, and if they see that any suspicious behaviour happened, they will just revert the transaction.<p>With the advent of the third wave of computing, the cloud, the Internet of Things, and whatnot, I think everything will just become a pseudo-intelligent big ball of semantics. Take the web for example. Nobody actually knows what a web browser should do. They just know that when you use a well battle tested browser, it will probably work on most sites, and usually wont be more than slightly degraded even on the sites it doesn&#x27;t work well on. These days protocols are evolving more into, just say what you want, and the machines will figure it out through their vast pools of information. This same kind of thing will make security issues irrelevant, because the Internet of Things will just know who you are (by various means obtained by their evolution), and you&#x27;ll never have to worry about an actual attacker doing damage to you.",1398835140

The logs indicate that primarily moderator account names and credentials were targeted.<p>Three 4chan Pass users had their Pass credentials accessed, and were notified and offered refunds and lifetime Passes shortly after the discovery. As a reminder, all payment information is processed securely by Stripe—we never see nor store any of it, and thus no payment information was compromised.<p>We patched the vulnerability quickly after it came to our attention, and have spent—and will continue to spend—dozens of hours poring over our software and systems to help mitigate and prevent future intrusions.<p>We’re sorry it happened, and will do our best to ensure it doesn’t happen again.<p>—moot",1398834408

I do respect the fact that many, many amazing things have come out of medial science but I treat it all with caution rather than just whatever-the-scientists-say-must-be-right. Then I watch something like &quot;Food Inc.&quot;[1] and become just a bit more skeptical of foods enhanced by science via processing, GMO, pesticides, whatever.  I want my food grown with plain ol&#x27; water & sunshine & animal feces fertilizer... at least for now.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286537/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1286537/</a>",1398834067

Is there some sort of gatekeeping mechanism? The help page refers to twitter card analytics, but that is not helpful. It would be nice to roll my own statistics off of that CSV instead of relying on hodge podges of services like Wildfire (<a href=""https://monitor.wildfireapp.com/count_reports/display?twitter=8ball_"" rel=""nofollow"">https://monitor.wildfireapp.com/count_reports/display?twitte...</a>)<p>In any case, I&#x27;d love to see this roll out to more accounts: I think the information on engagement, follow:unfollow ratios and mentions over time are incredibly useful for creating more meaningful content (for businesses and automated services), though I am not convinced such behavior is good for individuals, and am curious whether access to a dashboard increases or decreases engagement.",1398834023

Perfect octave inverts to an octave.<p>Perfect 4th (C to F) inverts to a perfect 5th! And vice-versa.<p>Contrast to a major third, or major second, which, when inverted, becomes a minor 6th (or minor seventh.) That is, the interval quality of perfects remains the same, where as major/minor/augmented/diminished intervals change qualities.",1398834002

I laughed it off, thinking MIT CS students would be too smart for this, but I was surprised it seemed to legitimately come from a @mit.edu address. It turned out someone was hacked, their address was used to send this, and apparently various people had fallen for it.",1398834001
