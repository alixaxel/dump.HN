XP2000 was a conference. You can believe me or not I guess, but back in the day all you had was your xUnit. Selenium was a twinkle in someone&#x27;s eye and local databases were not the norm.

7676951,comment,7676680,7676680,20,0,dasil003,,,"The elephant in the room here is the bugs that crop up in the interfaces between units.  Depending on your problem domain, it may be easier or harder to create interfaces between all these TDD&#x27;d, isolated modules.  There&#x27;s certainly value in a spec as isolated component documentation, but I&#x27;d argue there&#x27;s more value in specs for regressions, particularly when refactoring.  This is especially the case in dynamic languages like Ruby which require tests to avoid the most basic runtime errors.<p>The answer to this conundrum is often: that&#x27;s the job of the integration tests.  Okay, but integration tests are slow, so you&#x27;ll never test all the permutations of the interactions of the components.<p>DHH said during the keynote, &quot;it&#x27;s easy to make your tests fast when they don&#x27;t test anything&quot;.  Of course that&#x27;s hyperbole, but there&#x27;s a kernel of truth to be investigated there.  When working with something as complex as an ORM like ActiveRecord, isolating the business logic and using the ORM strictly for persistence may allow for fast tests, but you <i>still</i> run the risk of bugs creeping in on the interface because of some assumption about or change in the way ActiveRecord works between versions or whatever.<p>That&#x27;s why, as ugly and slow as Rails unit tests are, they are a simplifying compromise that strikes a balance between the theoretical ideal of a unit test and an integration test.  ActiveRecord itself is this way too, in that often times the business logic just isn&#x27;t complex enough to warrant the complexity of separating persistence from domain logic.

Although I&#x27;m still new to this position, it seems that our own methods are subject to just as much deception.  We basically want our models to coordinate with the actual heartbeat at only two exact moments, during the beginning of contraction and relaxation.  If I&#x27;ve understood what&#x27;s been done before, modeling these two brief periods during a single heart beat are all that are needed for publication.<p>I bring this up not to criticize my lab, obviously our work is meant to be a progression towards getting more and more accurate models.  I just think that it shows that even something that is considered hard science is subject to many of the same faults as anything else.  There are so many parameters and considerations to take into account that I don&#x27;t think the end goal is to build a comprehensive theory that explains computational modeling of physiological function in a similar way to how Newton&#x27;s laws predict the motions of the planets.  The goal is simply to create a model that works for the purposes of helping diagnose and treat people more accurately.<p>It seems that a crisis is imminent in the coming age of computational, statistical, and mathematical applications to all fields where researchers are not properly taught to distinguish between data science and building actual theories.

7676937,comment,7675698,7676832,3,0,schoen,,,"The example that I&#x27;m thinking of is if the FDE doesn&#x27;t provide authentication and the attacker can flip bits of plaintext by flipping bits of ciphertext, and the disk is used to store software, and attacker knows what block a particular binary will be stored in.  (The last assumption actually seems plausible if you an OS installer is sufficiently deterministic.  Maybe the OS installers from hosting providers like Linode, AWS, and DigitalOcean are that deterministic, even if some desktop OS installers aren&#x27;t?)<p>Then you could flip bits inside of the binaries to convert them into backdoored ones.  I have an example in a current presentation that I&#x27;ve been giving where a fencepost error in the OpenSSH server in 2002 (that resulted in a potential privilege escalation attack) was fixed by changing > to >=, which the compiler compiled as JL instead of JLE, which turned a single byte 0x7E into 0x7C.  (That is literally the entire effect of the patch!)<p>If you can find where on the disk that byte is stored and manage to flip that single bit back, you can re-introduce a particular security hole that the user believes was fixed back in 2002.  There are probably thousands of such bit-flips that would produce exploitable bugs, typically by modifying or inverting the sense of conditional branches, but maybe in other ways too.  (In cracking DRM in Apple II games, people used to replace tests or conditional branches with NOP, and that would still work to affect how security policies are enforced.)<p>Not all encryption modes will let you do this attack, but I think that relates to tptacek&#x27;s point originally that encryption software implementers need to be very careful about their selection of cipher modes and understand what kinds of attacks they defend against.<p>Elsewhere in this thread sdevlin was thinking about how in a non-tweak mode you can copy ciphertext from one block to another, which means if you could cause a particular file to exist on the drive, and then you can modify the ciphertext, you can cause one file to be overwritten by another (if you know the offsets where both are stored, which you might be able to learn if you know exactly when both were created and could monitor the ciphertext sufficiently often).  So for example, if you could send somebody an e-mail attachment that they would save to disk, you could later overwrite some other file (like one of their OS binaries?) with the contents of that attachment by copying the ciphertext block that represents the attachment over the ciphertext block that represents the other binary.<p>This is one of the main reasons that tweak modes exist, specifically to prevent an attacker from recognizing or copying ciphertext blocks between different locations within the overall ciphertext.<p>(Edit: sdevlin, not rdl.)",1398897397

Like Wikipedia or GNU in the older days, maybe even more. And like everything open-source, community-driven, it&#x27;s strongly dependent on how many people use it. Because, obviously, you are more likely to be wishing to contribute if you are using it yourself and, preferably, depend on your friends using it. And OSM is the kind of project that pretty much everyone potentially could contribute to, because local knowledge is invaluable for that kind of stuff. So caring for usability for everyone should be the primary goal, I&#x27;d assume.<p>Yet OSM is kinda &quot;b2b&quot; in terms it&#x27;s important for stuff like Foursquare running, but is close to unusable for the common user without stuff like MapBox, Foursquare and such. Because, really, what &quot;common user&quot; cares for? Where to find café nearby, how far is it from point A to point B (usually in some comparatively small area) and only very little information about the whole world (like major cities, country borders). More importantly, whatever information is there, he want&#x27;s it to be usable and accessible. That is, being fast to navigate, ability to make marks on your local device, accessible in offline. Ideally, of course, you&#x27;d also want to have seamless integration between offline and online modes, ability to share your local maps, there&#x27;s always something more to wish. So I feel that existence of good clients for all platforms and ability to extract information you need for them easily (without any self-education for that purpose at all, really) are absolutely must-have.<p>Well, alright, we cannot expect somebody else working for free to provide every single service we want after all. If you want something done, do it yourself, right? It&#x27;s how the open-source works, really. And that&#x27;s the real problem: documentation is horrible, both for &quot;common users&quot; and &quot;power users&quot; (potential developers). There&#x27;s quite impressive in sense of size wiki, but it&#x27;s totally awful in sense of usefulness. It&#x27;s very hard to get going if you are completely new to project and don&#x27;t know anything about cartography. There&#x27;s basically only one thing I want to know when I find anything new: how to use that thing. That is &quot;Getting started&quot; guide, followed by links to &quot;What&#x27;s next?&quot;. OSM wiki has something called &quot;Beginners&#x27; guide&quot;, but it must be a joke, as the only thing it does is explaining how do I actually edit that map, and that isn&#x27;t really &quot;using&quot;. (Again, if we don&#x27;t think of it as b2b only, which I explained why I think it&#x27;s wrong.)<p>The same time there&#x27;re articles on very wide range of topics, like existing software clients or &quot;Why open data is important&quot;. But you aren&#x27;t guided to stuff like that. And they are even worse. For example, why&#x27;d you care for existing clients? Right, you want to find one for your device. There might be several bests, sure, but neutral-point-of-view-style listing of a hundred of them does only a little better than nothing at all. If you want to know what you have to do (or know) in order to implement your own one — it&#x27;s even worse. The typical github project probably has better API overview than OSM (and usually even includes some domain-specific knowledge you probably don&#x27;t have if you are new to the field, which is absolutely natural in case of cartography).<p>If you want to see an example of good thematic wiki, look at ArchLinux wiki.",1398897335

And his argument (and Ferguson&#x27;s argument, and Liskov&#x27;s argument) isn&#x27;t hard to understand: by adopting disk sectors as the setting for your encryption, you trade transparency (the ability to use encryption on any filesystem) for a whole mess of constraints, which the article you&#x27;re commenting on lays out in detail. The worst of these constraints is that you lose any real authentication, but the fact that XTS is basically XEX-ECB is another problem.<p>You&#x27;ve also taken the &quot;two keys&quot; issue out of context. The issue isn&#x27;t that it unnecessarily uses two keys. The issue is that it&#x27;s hard to derive clean security proofs for XTS, because of all its complications. The way Rogaway puts it: there are three constructions involved in XTS --- the XTS wide-to-narrow block adapter, the &quot;XEX2&quot; two-key XEX construction for full narrow blocks, and the &quot;XEX3&quot; two-key construction for partial narrow blocks.<p>I believe you&#x27;re also wrong about the Evil Maid scenario. Perhaps you&#x27;re getting hung up on a detail that I wasn&#x27;t implicating (for instance, booting from the drive). The issue is that in a normal FDE setting, attackers don&#x27;t get <i>repeated</i> use-tamper-use cycles. But in a cloud-backed FDE setting, they easily do get that, so more sophisticated versions of the same attack scenario are possible. Think &quot;Evil Maid&quot; here in the same sense as Kenny Patterson used the &quot;BEAST&quot; attack scenario to build a plausible attack on RC4.<p>The problem with XTS is that there are better modes you can use, <i>even for sector-level encryption</i>, if you shake off the constraint that you&#x27;re working with physical disk geometry. Which, in the real world, a lot of FDE users can in fact do, because they&#x27;re not working with real disks but rather virtual disks stored on cloud filesystems.<p>If you don&#x27;t need to comply with physical disk geometry, it is probably feasible to get block-level encryption <i>with strong authentication guarantees</i>, and with a native wide-block PRP that will get rid of the ECB data leak in XTS.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t use XTS for anything but FDE, even if you know what you&#x27;re doing. That&#x27;s a bit of a tautological statement for me to make, because if you know XTS, you also know that it&#x27;s only meant for FDE --- but I&#x27;ve been getting comments from people who have seen XTS used in application-layer crypto.

For example, if you used blockcipher=single DES, the attacker can break the cipher by breaking single DES by brute force.<p>Indeed, even if blockcipher=AES256, the attacker can still break CTR by merely guessing key in 2²⁵⁶ operations.  (Likely only one such value of key will yield meaningful plaintext throughout the entire multi-block message.)  That is contrary to the information-theoretic security property of OTP, where the attacker <i>can&#x27;t tell</i> whether they&#x27;ve correctly guessed the key.<p>More to tptacek&#x27;s point, if you&#x27;re using the block offset as i, then if you write the same block 30 times, you used the same value blockcipher(key, nonce . i) each time.  That isn&#x27;t a one-time use of that part of the pad, it&#x27;s a 30-time use of that part of the pad.

With a lot of vegans, its often not that they&#x27;re wrong about what they say, its how they convey it.  This came up today in another HN discussion on smoking as well.  Its ok for them to not like things, just don&#x27;t be a jerk about it.<p>On topic, while I agree that we may very well all die, this can also be looked at in a different perspective.  When the antibiotic in question was first introduced, it had effectively a 5/5 chance of working.  After ten years, it then had a 4/5 chance of working.  Like most power laws, in maybe 10-20 years, it will have a 3/5 chance of working, ect... with a decay rate that slows with time.<p>Like all evolution, antibiotic resistance is driven primarily by the rate of survival and reproduction in the population.  If resistance against AntibioticA is a strong predictor of survival (like when its newly introduced, and highly effective), then lots of bacteria will develop the immunity.  As it gets used less, due to limited effectiveness, then it will become less of a predictor, and less bacteria will multiply with that as a trait.<p>Its not like evolution is &quot;free&quot; either.  Often times, if an organism becomes heavily specialized in fending off one threat, then they leave themselves open to invasive species or perpendicular threats.  I firmly believe that we have intelligence (I really do) and that while natural evolution is powerful, we already have many of the tools necessary to understand, and adapt along with it.  We just need to be able to understand why they&#x27;re changing, how they&#x27;re changing, and how we can exploit that process for our gain.",1398895641

7676770,comment,7675418,7676732,2,0,logicallee,,,"As you can see in my other comments the basic things it lacks are a worldwide history of acceptance as currency (going back millennia in the case of gold) as well as uniqueness (the non-existence of equivalent substitutes).  Whatever the technical characteristics of bitcoin, an alt coin can have the same technical characteristics.  So we are riding a thin uniqueness, in terms of level of acceptance, that is not going to be driven deeper due to limits on adoption as a currency. (That I mention elsewhere.)<p>The uniqueness is a special lock-in for gold, and as gold becomes inconvenient due to price or scarcity, you can&#x27;t just transfer it to Pt (platinum) or Ag (silver) in 10 minutes times however many confirmations you need.  Gold has several layers of stickiness or lock-in, including historical <i>and</i> technical/physical.<p>Not so for bitcoin.  It has self-limiting on adoption (due to the lack of anyone minting it by fiat, and its low total numbers), but moving away from it takes just minutes.<p>The most interesting chart is seeing the fall of bitcoin market cap against the rise of all other alt coins market cap - and to see if that is on the fall or on the rise.<p>Especially when things aren&#x27;t denominated in BTC, but it is just used transiently, really, any other currency with a spot price will do just as well.  There is no reason to believe bitcoin will have any greater use as a currency in the future than it does now.  And unlike gold, it has no historical lock-in as a long-term store of value.  No one is &quot;stuck&quot; with it, it is easy to verify transfer, and it is a totally liquid market (even at 3 AM on bank holidays) that is not held up by any printed prices or industrial uses.<p>It doesn&#x27;t even have basic exchange mechanisms such as halting trading.  The spot price of Bitcoin can collapse overnight.  Unlike gold, there is just anything holding it up long-term.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like pokemon cards, beanie babies, or pogs.  Sure it can have value for a while, but as it doesn&#x27;t see adoption as a currency, has no alternative or basic uses (less than these three examples in fact), and is very easy to move away from - there is no reason to suppose this will not happen.  Bitcoin for a while was the only currency with its particular properties.  But that is far from true anymore.",1398895356
