7645850,comment,7645592,7645798,9,0,StevePerkins,,,"You generally only let the ORM create/update your schema during early development.  By the time you get to production (or heck, by the time your team is even seriously engaged), you will have disabled that feature.  In pretty much every enterprise-grade ORM I&#x27;ve ever seen, schema modification is disabled by default, and must be explicitly turned on.  In most Java shops where I&#x27;ve ever worked... unless it&#x27;s a quick prototype, the database schema will be developed before you start coding anyway.  Also, in a typical enterprise scenario, the username with which you configure the ORM lacks admin-level privileges to alter the database.<p>Most of the criticisms about ORM&#x27;s come from people who have never used them, beyond maybe working through a Rails chat-room tutorial once upon a time.  It really has nothing to do with &quot;abstracting away the database&quot;.<p>As the name indicates, Object-Relational Mapping is merely about reducing the boilerplate required to map a relational schema to programming language objects.  If you do that mapping by hand, then you have to make decisions when a table/object has relationships.  Picture a CUSTOMER table, which has a foreign key relationship to an ADDRESS table.  When your application loads a &quot;Customer&quot; object:<p>[1] You could &quot;eager fetch&quot;, meaning that you go ahead and retrieve all of the ADDRESS rows related to that CUSTOMER, and attach the Address objects to the Customer object.  Eager fetching is wasteful and leads to poor performance, because you&#x27;re hammering your database for values that you often don&#x27;t ever use.<p>[2] You could &quot;lazy load&quot;... meaning that your Customer object has an &quot;addresses&quot; field, but you wait until some code tries to use that field before you actually query the ADDRESS table to populate it.  This is much better design, but complicates things.  The lazy load logic has to go somewhere.  You either have to ensure that every piece of code using that object is aware of the lazy load pattern, or you have to stuff database logic into the &quot;getter&quot; method for each lazy-loaded field.<p>ORM&#x27;s give you highly-performant lazy loading, without the buggy boilerplate suggested by #2 above.  Moreover, enterprise-class ORM&#x27;s typically handle caching for you, to avoid hitting the database unnecessarily.  Monitoring the state of objects to notice when they&#x27;ve gone stale due to changes on the database side, etc.<p>Lastly, for complex queries, most ORM&#x27;s have a query language (e.g. JQL, HQL, etc) that is nothing more than a VERY THIN wrapper around SQL.  It merely smooths out differences between various vendor dialects.  You&#x27;re not abstracted away from the database, you still very much need to understand SQL and the underlying structure of your data.",1398427086

7645820,comment,7644904,7644904,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"Google+ came in a time when social network fatigue was setting in (Facebook usage was declining in the US) but there still wasn&#x27;t a clear sense of what people wanted in a social networking site.<p>It was an uphill battle, and nearly unwinnable the way Google chose to take it on.<p>Google Hangouts was, in my view, one of their biggest assets. It&#x27;s a solid piece of technology. It was way better than its competitors. The problem is that they couldn&#x27;t come up with a viable way to make it part of Google+, rather than a great standalone project. The vision was that people would spend time in Google+ and &quot;hang out&quot; with others who were available. I knew, off the bat, that that wouldn&#x27;t happen without (at first) a context around which to structure a hangout. Board games are a great starting social context for early adopters, but since they&#x27;re a cognitively upscale group, you need <i>quality</i> games, not Zyngarbage like Farmville.<p>I thought that a focus on game quality (Real Games Initiative) could, even though it&#x27;d piss off counterparties like Zynga wanting to throw us our crap (because they didn&#x27;t expect us to succeed) and still get preferential treatment, give people a context in which they&#x27;d actually get comfortable in G+, and then want to use it. Games were an area in which (circa 2011) Facebook was shitting the bed-- low-quality games and game spam were a primary driver of social network fatigue-- and I thought it was a great way to distinguish ourselves as cognitively upscale and attract early adopters and the more charismatic elements of the early majority.<p>Maybe a quality Games product wouldn&#x27;t have saved G+. It&#x27;s too late to know for sure, and I&#x27;d guess that RNCH was a bigger problem, but I feel like that was a key battle that has been lost.",1398426278

If you want to maintain even eventual consistency, any update that crosses document boundaries has to be thought about very seriously in order to avoid breakages in the face of concurrent modifications.  So, ideally you design your documents such that any one logical operation only has to hit one document.<p>This is pretty easy for very simple tasks, but can get rapidly more difficult in the face of more complex or changing requirements.  I suspect a substantial proportion of Mongo or Couch based applications simply ignore this problem, and are lucky that they don&#x27;t have enough concurrent activity that stuff breaks frequently.<p>Using Postgres/JSON neatly avoids this problem because you get ACID back, and you can do cross-document updates all you like.",1398425908

I knew someone was pulling strings on him and I had thought that he was taking orders related to my criticism of the G+ direction (in fact, the G+ executives were, as far as I know, innocent) but it was actually because an executive (who&#x27;s since been disciplined) flagged me as a union risk. I said something to the effect of &quot;decisions would be better if made on the floor&quot; and that was taken to mean <i>far</i> more than I actually meant. (I was talking about G+ Games, not unionizing the Valley. Small difference.)<p>However, that ordeal and the career problems I&#x27;ve faced since then have convinced me that we need to unionize software development and the Valley ecosystem.<p>The Valley is fucking <i>terrified</i> of unions. So terrified that if you even seem like you <i>might</i> be leaning that way, executive-level people in major companies will go out of their way to fuck up your career. A lot of the back-channel reference checking that goes on in the Valley is to avoid taking on a potential unionist. No one cares if you were a mediocre performer 3 jobs ago. That stuff is there to black-list potential unionizers.<p>Now, do I think we want or need a factory-style union where promotions and pay are based on seniority? Hell no. That&#x27;s a terrible idea. Engineers who work their asses off to become the best they can be, and to advance their respective fields, should be rewarded. I think that the top engineers would make <i>more</i> with a properly-designed union structure than they do now (since, currently, they top out at 1.5 times the pay of mediocre ones). I think our model needs to be more like the Hollywood unions (writers&#x27; and actors&#x27; guilds). Those do not curtail the financial upside for their members (there are still actors making millions per year) nor do they produce mediocrity. (Say what you want about Hollywood&#x27;s product, but it&#x27;s immensely commercially successful and the envy of the pop-culture world.)<p>Specific union protections we need include:<p><pre><code>    * readily available legal support when faced with non-paying clients or bad-faith\n      employers. \n    * recourse against clients and employers who use reputation threats to justify \n      nonpayment or bad behavior (i.e. &quot;if you don&#x27;t accept our unfunded scope creep, \n      we&#x27;ll call other clients.&quot;)\n    * (for employees) representation when in trouble with management. The right to \n      have a representative *in the room* (mostly, because if you negotiate on your\n      own behalf, you&#x27;re at risk of getting emotional and saying something\n      stupid) when dealing with management or HR.\n    * defense against negative references and back-channel reference checks in \n      general. \n    * transparency in compensation.\n    * protection against &quot;no-poach&quot; lists and blacklists. A union tip line\n      can help with that.\n    * protection against sharing of individual HR data (salaries, \n      performance reviews) among companies, often used to keep pay down. \n    * negotiation of terms that are embarrassing for an individual to\n      formally address, such as severance, health accommodations\n      and workplace privacy.\n</code></pre>\nThese are all things that we can have, and that we deserve, that bring none of the negative side effects associated with unions.",1398424570

I used to think along similar lines, until an entomologist explained to me that Occam&#x27;s razor has a very valid place in the branch of biology called &quot;systematics&quot;:<p>from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsimony#Biology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsimony#Biology</a> (scroll past the bit about evolution):<p>(quote)<p>Systematics is the branch of biology that attempts to establish genealogical relationships among organisms. It is also concerned with their classification. There are three primary camps in systematics; cladists, pheneticists, and evolutionary taxonomists. The cladists hold that genealogy alone should determine classification and pheneticists contend that similarity over propinquity of descent is the determining criterion while evolutionary taxonomists say that both genealogy and similarity count in classification.<p>It is among the cladists that Occam&#x27;s Razor is to be found, although their term for it is cladistic parsimony. Cladistic parsimony (or maximum parsimony) is a method of phylogenetic inference in the construction of types of phylogenetic trees (more specifically, cladograms). Cladograms are branching, tree-like structures used to represent lines of descent based on one or more evolutionary changes. Cladistic parsimony is used to support the hypotheses that require the fewest evolutionary changes. For some types of tree, it will consistently produce the wrong results regardless of how much data is collected (this is called long branch attraction). For a full treatment of cladistic parsimony, see Elliott Sober&#x27;s Reconstructing the Past: Parsimony, Evolution, and Inference (1988). For a discussion of both uses of Occam&#x27;s Razor in biology, see Sober&#x27;s article &quot;Let&#x27;s Razor Ockham&#x27;s Razor&quot; (1990).<p>Other methods for inferring evolutionary relationships use parsimony in a more traditional way. Likelihood methods for phylogeny use parsimony as they do for all likelihood tests, with hypotheses requiring few differing parameters (i.e., numbers of different rates of character change or different frequencies of character state transitions) being treated as null hypotheses relative to hypotheses requiring many differing parameters. Thus, complex hypotheses must predict data much better than do simple hypotheses before researchers reject the simple hypotheses. Recent advances employ information theory, a close cousin of likelihood, which uses Occam&#x27;s Razor in the same way.<p>(end quote)<p>Of course, if you read the above and maybe follow a few related links from the WP article, you&#x27;ll see that it&#x27;s not <i>quite</i> as straight forward as that, Occam&#x27;s razor / cladistic parsimony isn&#x27;t always valid in systematics, but it&#x27;s an indispensable tool because the search space of valid solutions is so huge, they need a kind of heuristic to guide the way to the most scientifically interesting results (this then becomes not about finding the one correct truth, but about deciding which part of the bigger truth to uncover first).",1398423852
