Every situation where I&#x27;ve had to write performant code has ended up in one of these two cases:<p>1. All the time is spent in linear algebra, in which case it&#x27;s all about planning out the computation so LAPACK can do its thing.<p>2. There&#x27;s some funky custom signal manipulation. Some tiny bit of code needs to be in C, with everything in nice packed arrays in the right order so you can sweep straight through.",1398671850

Need to adapt lens XYZ to my Sony A7? (Even in situations where I might have no idea what kind of screwball  mount lens XYZ is using?) No problem, I&#x27;ll just calculate the flange focal distance differential (may involve some eyeballing/fudge-factoring on unknown mounts), measure the bayonet screws and print something up.

Typically the things that get printed are pretty much cereal-box-toy quality and importance.  The most useful thing I&#x27;ve printed was a toothbrush holder that I designed myself, and the most fun thing was when my daughter needed to bring in &quot;a shape&quot; for her kindergarten class, so we printed up a set of platonic solids.  She&#x27;s an aspie (yea, really) and proceeded to lecture her class...<p>For the first few months I had a lot of trouble with it failing to print the filament wouldn&#x27;t advance so it would skip a slice, and then when it would catch it would end up creating a mass of goo on the end of the print head.  Turns out that there was an upgrade made available where instead of a set screw, there was an active lever holding the filiment in place to ensure contact with the feed motor.  Once I had that in place, it printed far more reliably.  The biggest problems I have right now are the PLA curling on large flat pieces.<p>I would say that I do enjoy using openscad to design things.  I&#x27;ve tried the online &quot;move blocks around and drag and drop your way to 3d success&quot; apps, but I just can&#x27;t think that way and invariably I end up with a frustrating mess.

For my first pass I just setup a mirror port (SPAN) port from a core switch. libpcap has efficient filters so non-SIP (non port 5060) traffic was just dropped.<p>Looking forward: Intel 10G NICs have little processor in them, and there&#x27;s a library called DNA (Direct NIC Access) that bypasses kernel mode for packet capture/transmit. Makes it super efficient and possible to do line-rate 10G apps on commodity hardware.<p>Those processors can also distribute packets to specific cores, which helps solves the next problem of scaling the capture part beyond a single core. Looking beyond 10G to 40G and beyond, I&#x27;d imagine something similar to Etherchannelling  would be a cheap way to leverage existing hardware into breaking up the load. Unfortunately a low-level &quot;dumb&quot; load balancing system will split up dialogs so your indexing and compression gets a bit less efficient.<p>One of my semi-open research projects is to do line-rate SIP DDoS protection. So far, no one (not commercially, not academically) has any magic bullet and it would appear that almost every SIP network out there is trivially DoS-able.<p>State-of-the-art is along the lines of &quot;we push a whitelist into our switches&quot; (which, actually, technically doesn&#x27;t even work with SIP since multiple IPs can get involved with the signalling, IPs unrelated to original hosts - although I&#x27;ve only seen this once or twice in production).<p>As far as I can tell, it&#x27;s mainly an engineering problem - just do the grunt work of writing smart code.

I develop a cluster database product, and erlang seems to have an answer for many problems that I have actually faced.<p>For instance: cluster global pids. When you send a message to a pid, you don&#x27;t have to go through a dance of handling errors and timeouts just because it might live on another node. If the node goes down, there are several ways to handle that, including monitor_node() which gives you a message that you can handle in one place.<p>I haven&#x27;t used erlang in production, but I&#x27;ve invested some time to learn about it because I see that potential value.<p>I don&#x27;t really see that from Go. It seems to fall into a &quot;general-purpose&quot; bucket where it competes with Java, C#, python, ruby, haskell, clojure, scala, etc. I don&#x27;t necessarily like all of those languages, and for any given one you can probably pick out some Go advantages. A lot of people say Go hits a nice sweet spot for many applications.<p>But Go just doesn&#x27;t speak to any problems I actually have. It can&#x27;t replace the C/C++ code, because Go has a GC, and the code is C/C++ because it needs to manage memory[1]. It could replace the python code, perhaps to some benefit, but there would still be a bunch of awkward communication between processes and all of the associated error handling mess. And it can&#x27;t replace Java, because that&#x27;s a public API we offer, and lots of people are comfortable with Java.<p>Go should have been another cluster language/VM that really could compete with erlang, in my opinion.
