7660794,comment,7660246,7660512,5,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> This definition is harder for some people to accept because it means that you need to look at yourself and think about what power imbalances you might be benefiting from, and it means you can&#x27;t just do s/female/male/g and make it just as sexist.<p>I think it&#x27;s more Darwinian than that. No one comes to the realization one day that they benefit from institutional power dynamics and then sets out to change the system to their own detriment. The reason men want more women in technology is not that they&#x27;re worried about women -- not as a first class objective. It&#x27;s rather that they believe they (and the society they live in) will benefit from more gender diversity in the industry. The fact that this will also produce benefits for women is a happy harmony because it means we don&#x27;t have to fight about it.<p>Which is why the &quot;reinforces institutionalized power structure&quot; definition is such a loser. It frames the issue as battle of the sexes rather than everyone cooperating to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. So then instead of everyone finding a way to help women without hurting men, you create two sides where one is trying to help women <i>by</i> hurting men and the other starts throwing rocks from the top of the mountain because they don&#x27;t want to be hurt. Which doesn&#x27;t benefit anybody.",1398700685

7660787,comment,7659394,7659394,6,0,mwcampbell,,,"I must strongly recommend against using Gtk+ as a GUI toolkit for any serious application except on GNU/Linux. The biggest reason for me is that Gtk+ has zero accessibility support on Windows or Mac. That is, it doesn&#x27;t work with assistive technologies which people with some disabilities need, such as screen readers for blind people. If you develop an application using an inaccessible toolkit, you&#x27;re erecting a barrier for some people who might need to use your app, particularly if it&#x27;s going to be used in an educational or business setting.<p>So, what should you use instead? Qt is better, but not great. It&#x27;s still bad enough that TeamTalk, a voice chat app that&#x27;s popular among blind people, has a cross-platform Qt app but also a &quot;classic&quot; MFC app for Windows. The latter used to be the official Windows client, but is now maintained just for blind users.<p>wxWidgets is better in some ways, because it uses native controls on each platform. Except where it doesn&#x27;t; for example, the data view control is non-native on Windows, whereas the list view control is non-native in the Mac and GTK ports. and wxHTML is non-native across the board. Still, with some pain, wxWidgets can be made to work for cross-platform accessible apps.<p>SWT might be a good choice, if you can make it work for .NET/Mono using IKVM.NET. SWT is better than wx in that where it has to use non-native controls, it implements the platform accessibility APIs; it helps that SWT is backed by IBM, which has the resources to put into this kind of thing, and the incentive to do so in the form of sales to government agencies and the like.",1398700642

I did some light editing for clarity and to redact names.<p>----------------------------<p>Dear <original 1:1 author>,<p>No, because then we&#x27;ll be judging speakers on a trait that has <i>nothing</i> to do with their coding or presentation skills. I&#x27;m not going discriminate against a male simply because he is a male for the same reason I wont discriminate against a female because she is female. Equality of opportunity is what I care about, not equality of results, and right now we have an open call for speakers.<p><original 1:1 author>, where do we draw the line? Should i not pick an Asian guy because they&#x27;re over represented in the tech community (and our speaker selection)? &quot;sorry <asian presenter 1> and <asian presenter 2>, we know you&#x27;ve spoken at all 14 of our events but can only pick one of you since you hail from Asia&quot;. Do we need a quota for blacks and hispanics? Do we use their representation nationwide or just in <our state> when we set the quota? Do you want to look <hispanic presenter friend> the face when you announce the quota, so he gets to wonder if he was picked because he gives good presentations or if he was picked because he&#x27;s brown? Should we put sexual preference on the speaker submission form? I mean, LGBT makes up 6% of the country, right? We should really have at least one. I&#x27;m friends with a transgendered female, she is super bright and I&#x27;ve been encouraging her to present. Now she&#x27;ll get to wonder if she was just picked to fill a quota instead of thinking that I wanted to hear her speak. You tell me if she counts as a female for your quota, I mean she has more testosterone than your average woman and she was born a male. There&#x27;s a lot of talk about age discrimination, should we reserve 20% for speakers over 60? If an Hispanic 63 year old woman asks to speak, does she fill three quotas at once, or is it only one?<p>In short, no, I think this is a horrible, sexist idea. If on the other hand you want to have a panel discussion on gender in tech, I&#x27;m cool with that. I&#x27;d also be willing to reserve  X% (20?) of slots for first time speakers. And if someone wanted to give a presentation on how programmers gender actually effects their ability to write an algorithm, I guarantee you I will pick them (<i>regardless</i> if it is a male or female presenter). If you&#x27;d like to go on a campaign to encourage certain genders, races, ages to submit a session, feel free, but as long as I&#x27;m in charge of speaker selections I&#x27;ll continue to pick solely on the session abstract and the experience of the speaker.<p>I&#x27;d also like to add that I like diversity of thought and experience.

In order to minimize this impact you will need to isolate that code dependency from other parts of the system.

That isolation is not a result of TDD, it is a good design principle that TDD helps enforce.<p>As for cache cohesion, algorithmic complexity, etc. I wouldn&#x27;t encode those in a test any more than I would encode a requirement to use while loops vs. recursion.

Writing performance correctness tests first has all the same advantages as writing algorithmic correctness tests first, and I heartily recommend doing so.

Such fast uptake of a mission concept is incredibly rare.<p>Then the larger asteroid science community took interest, and was somewhat disgruntled because the concept had not been vetted by the community at large.

7660723,comment,7659251,7659867,1,0,Glide,,,"I would half agree. A fully testable implementation being broken up into blocks that are testable is pretty much a truism. In order to construct software that is testable it must be done in a particular way. So the granularity of testing forces the size of testable modules of a system.<p>However, it&#x27;s not about logically relevant or longer blocks of code. It is more about coupling. In untestable code the coupling is usually high, one cannot modify one part of the system without affecting another. I believe that this is why programming to an interface rather than an implementation is a very important concept.<p>So let&#x27;s imagine a look at the &quot;extreme&quot; end of the spectrum of TDD with unit tests where they practice ping pong pair programming (programmers trade off writing tests and passing them) the code will likely look different. The &quot;testable unit&quot; is now not only the size of a unit test (constrained to a single class in OOP languages), but the ping pong aspect ensures that these code would be added in a time limit between tests (just try hogging the keyboard for half a day!). This doesn&#x27;t mean that methods won&#x27;t become long, it just means that the human constraints around the problem will force it to become a certain size.<p>There are some costs, but usually smaller classes are far easier to understand and maintain. After making a codebase testable you&#x27;ll usually find that the code goes from procedural to object oriented.",1398700065

Some people don’t think that one should profit from the use of deadly force; in that case, not using a significant portion of that company’s profits to repair damages from misused weapons would be callous. In most cases, weapons manufacturer are direly aware of the issue with what they sell, and try to make better quality devices to prevent them. Namely, a policeman friend told me that Glocks (could be another brand, I know very little about firearms) were appreciated by her colleagues who do a lot of pursuits because they don’t tend to accidentally fire when they drop from their holster, a rare but potentially tragic event. Glock makes money from that fear, hopefully invest to mitigate it.<p>I know government processes better, and as someone who could be seen as a socialist, I agree with Musk on one thing: government is expensive. Unlike him, I think it’s generally cheaper than private companies or charity. However, in the industries where Musk operates (transport), his entrepreneurial talent makes his contribution much cheaper. He doesn’t like public money to be wasted — that’s his publicly stated “political leanings” and one that has motivated SpaceX existence. I don’t think it’s very controversial, actually (no one likes to waste money) but it is relevant. What he asks for is to have the ability to lower it.<p>Therefore: yes, his leanings matter. In that case, and probably a majority of his projects that are government-funded, they are so because it is cheaper to have Musk’s company do it. Which is good. I’m not a US tax payer, so I shouldn’t care so much, but I would say: there isn’t a contradiction with trying to improve what you think is broken. If he was asking to prevent competitors from entering the market for government-contract, there I could see an issue.",1398700065

That doesn&#x27;t mean that they&#x27;re different in terms of intelligence, ability, or worth. Treating minorities &quot;differently&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;helping&quot;, is logical.

7660615,comment,7658876,7658876,1,0,agl,,,"The primary aim[1] of CRLSets was always to be a mechanism via which we could quickly react to CA situations like DigiNotar, ANSSI etc. Doing full binary pushes like we did during a few years back was too heavy.<p>As a secondary aim, we tried to make them do something more. Quoting myself[2]:<p>&quot;The original hope with CRLSets was that we could get revocations categorised into important and administrative and push only the important ones. (Administrative revocations occur when a certificate is changed with no reason to suspect that any key compromise occurred.)&quot;.<p>Certainly at the time, and probably even now with the large number of post-Heartbleed revocations, most revocations are not done because key compromise is feared, but because a certificate is getting rotated for other reasons. (E.g. a site asked for a certificate to be reissued with different names but the same key. The old certificate now hangs around as a revocation for years.)<p>It seemed reasonable that a few tens of thousands of revocations would be enough to cover the cases where actual key compromise worries had occured - if the CAs would sort them. Again, quoting myself[2]: &quot;Sadly, that mostly hasn&#x27;t happened.&quot;<p>The text even contains a situation where online revocation checking is supposed to help, except it probably doesn&#x27;t as usual:<p>The claim is that a user will download and cache a CRL while not being attacked and then be protected from a local attacker using a certificate that was included on that CRL.<p>The problem is that OCSP only covers a single certificate. OCSP is used in preference because it&#x27;s so much smaller and thus removes the need to download CRLs. So the user isn&#x27;t expected to download and cache the CRL anyway. So that doesn&#x27;t work.<p>However, it&#x27;s clear that /someone/ is downloading CRLs because Cloudflare are spending half a million dollars a month[3] to serve Globalsign&#x27;s CRLs. Possibily it&#x27;s non-browser clients but the bulk is probably CAPI (the library that IE, Chrome and other software on Windows typically uses - although not Firefox). CAPI will download a CRL when it has 50 or more OCSP responses cached for a given CA certificate. But CAs know this and /split/ their CRLs so that they <i>don&#x27;t</i> get hit with huge bandwidth bills. But a split CRL renders the &quot;protection&quot; from caching ineffective.<p>So that argument is actually for something like CRLSets (download and cache revocations) over online checking. It&#x27;s just a clumsy way of arguing that the downloaded data should be much larger so that it covers most or all revocations. Quoting myself again:<p>&quot;Perhaps we need to consider a system that can handle much larger numbers of revocations, but the data in that case is likely to be two orders of magnitude larger and it&#x27;s very unlikely that the current CRLSet design is still optimal when the goal moves that far. It&#x27;s also a lot of data for every user to be downloading and perhaps efforts would be better spent elsewhere. It&#x27;s still the case that an attacker that can intercept traffic can easily perform an SSL Stripping attack on most sites; they hardly need to fight revoked certificates.&quot;<p>The conclusions in the text that follow from that reasoning are then mostly wrong, although OCSP Must Staple is still a nice idea. If Firefox implement it first then good for them. It&#x27;s tougher for Chrome because we use the platform&#x27;s verification libraries.<p>(I wrote a bunch of thoughts about what a good design for a &quot;large&quot; CRLSet would look like[5].)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/02/05/crlsets.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.imperialviolet.org/2012/02/05/crlsets.html</a>\n[2] <a href=""https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/04/19/revchecking.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.imperialviolet.org/2014/04/19/revchecking.html</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-hard-costs-of-heartbleed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.cloudflare.com/the-hard-costs-of-heartbleed</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee619754(v=ws.10).aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee619754(v=ws.10)...</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/04/29/filters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/04/29/filters.html</a>",1398699233

Recently, I (an asian male) was a teacher assistant at the very first ClojureBridge, and during the training I learned more about why these workshops are useful and important. They create an environment where attendees feel more comfortable learning, making it much more likely that attendees will be successful in learning to program. You can argue whether or not it&#x27;s &quot;right&quot; that women would feel more comfortable attending a workshop geared specifically toward women, but frankly I think that&#x27;s irrelevant.<p>The author says that these organizations give the message that &quot;These people are different from the majority so we need to treat them differently.&quot; Well, yes. What&#x27;s wrong with that? The author doesn&#x27;t explain. In any case, I think this is a good thing because the majority already has special treatment, thanks to human nature. There is ample evidence that women and black people are seen as less capable, even by people who have no desire to be prejudiced.

Or, at least, the latter necessarily implies the former.<p>> Taking testability to the extreme you can end up with a ton of anemic classes with hardly any correspondence between the class breakdown, method signatures and so forth and the actual domain<p>I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s really taking &quot;testability&quot; to the extreme.

It&#x27;s not an extreme of testability, that&#x27;s just understanding one corner case relating to testability without understand its context within testability or domain modelling.<p>Now, I&#x27;ve certainly heard from proponents of TDD that take that approach, but they aren&#x27;t really representative of TDD as a whole.

Once you get a surface structure damage on, say, your &quot;lotus effect functionalized&quot; bathtub, house wall, car body, dirt starts to accumulate on this spot.

Everything must fit into the tight containers of model/controller/view, or You&#x27;re Doing It Wrong. You have to remember that Rails was created as the anti-J2EE where High Design was the order of the day. Given these leanings, DHH is extremely sensitive to letting other abstractions sneak in. He doesn&#x27;t want to pollute the idea of simple design in Rails.<p>Rails tries to squeak by as Good Enough (like everything else web-based) design for many apps, and it succeeds there. Problems arise when you start developing a sense for design that exceeds the myopic view of Rails.<p>As much as Rails is made for programmer-happiness, I find it really dull. I get the feeling I&#x27;m more filling holes in DHH&#x27;s playground than actually writing software. But it makes sense; as a tool, it&#x27;s designed to <i>remove</i> lots of choice to prevent the &#x27;unspeakable horrors&#x27; of people putting code wherever the want.<p>In a way, it&#x27;s like Java: by taking choices off the table, you can guide newer developers to not create abominations. But it also hinders more experienced developers from creating software with abstractions/architecture that fits like a glove. Worse, it also indoctrinates inexperienced developers to systematically denigrate design and architecture because they&#x27;ve been trained to outsource it to a framework written by &#x27;really smart&#x27; people.

I had to dig up the original image using Wayback Machine (thanks, archive.org!) but then, to my surprise, their answer didn&#x27;t actually work.  It merely darkened the image uniformly, meaning it wasn&#x27;t able to find any potential Waldos.<p>I fiddled around with their solution for a bit, and then finally just hooked their parameter up to a slider.

Then, 0.19 gives another incorrect solution (the lower-right circle).  Finally, 0.20 identifies Waldo.<p>So this solution is a nice way to filter out potential targets, but I wish I could figure out whether the original poster was being shady or whether Mathematica&#x27;s internals changed since they posted their answer.  I&#x27;m inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt, but that has me burning with curiosity about what exactly must&#x27;ve changed in Mathematica&#x27;s implementation.<p>EDIT:  I didn&#x27;t do the most basic of checks: to make sure I didn&#x27;t introduce any changes in the original experiment.

For someone very familiar with the workflow of typing &quot;debugger&quot; in Javascript code, being able to stop the world at any state, examine variables, and having a fully-functional REPL to test expressions,</i><p>Use cgdb for a nicer interface. Also, you can examine variables and set break points in gdb. Instead of a REPL, you can try out expressions in main(). Your workflow has to change, so if that&#x27;s a deal-breaker, it is what it is. But if you can change, there are some advantages to be gained.",1398697410

Many people (including some commenters here) seem to think that the technology is useless unless it can handle all possible situations.<p>Auto-drive on long highway sections would be an amazing improvement by itself and prevent all kinds of fatigue related accidents.  The cars could just announce (&quot;Driver, take control&quot;) as they exit the highway system.<p>Hell, trucking companies could just have drivers waiting at highway exits to do the last-mile driving, the long-haul sections of trucking wouldn&#x27;t require a person on-board.<p>I don&#x27;t think it would be unfeasible to install beacons designed to aid driverless vehicles either, especially on highways where things don&#x27;t change very quickly.

Not the flip-flop in the article you&#x27;re pointing out, but I&#x27;ve often wonder when the switch happened in general. Old articles and even TV[1] will use Internet without the definite article. Then, sometime in the mid-late 90&#x27;s, we started placing &#x27;The&#x27; out in front.<p>My guess would be that techies originally did not use the definite article because other networks existed and had their own names. FidoNet, BITNET, etc. Thus &#x27;Internet&#x27; was just a name to distinguish between other networks. Then, as the mainstream population started using Internet and saw that as the sole go-to network, it became &#x27;The&#x27; Internet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://youtu.be/fxfhInhkvtM"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/fxfhInhkvtM</a>",1398697371
