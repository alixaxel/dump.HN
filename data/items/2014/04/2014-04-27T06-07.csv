It&#x27;s not like working for big employers (and entrusting Wall Street with one&#x27;s retirement) worked out really well in the past decade either.<p>Every company is out there &quot;hustling&quot;, as they compete with one another. So is it so much better to delegate the hustling aspect of life to one&#x27;s CEO? Or are we all just turning over power and rewards to those people, in exchange for a quieter life?<p>It does get at the question - what are companies even for? According to free market theories, we should <i>all</i> be selling our labor freelance. The standard answer for a long while was that transaction costs would be too high. So possibly AirBnB and Uber are solving that, and more of us can jettison the dead weight of having bosses who specialize in hustling.<p>The only problem is that they are completely artificial &quot;markets&quot;, and they&#x27;re taking a tremendous percentage.

The attraction of Go to me is in its commitment to simplicity, at the expense of some power or terseness it becomes easy to read, easy to extend, and hard to use to create monstrous complexity.<p>It feels like an improved C rather than building on the traditions of C++ say.<p>The package system, import system, composition and no inheritance, and extensive use of interfaces all encourage simplicity above all.<p>Composition - it&#x27;s harder to create huge taxonomies which all depend on a common root.<p>Packaging - encourages very simple small components rather than huge frameworks which are hard or even impossible to understand all at once or separate into components. Godep[2] looks interesting here, thanks for the link.<p>Interfaces - similar to many other languages, but without the boilerplate of declarations (this sort of decision is where controversies start - what some see as boilerplate others see as important contracts, same goes for header files).<p>It is of course missing a few things which would be nice, but nothing should stop people trying it out today - if you value simplicity above all, Golang will probably appeal.<p>1. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7653164"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7653164</a><p>2. <a href=""https://github.com/tools/godep"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tools/godep</a>",1398580638

7654189,comment,7653164,7653164,18,0,eridius,,,"The first example is not emergent behavior. And it has nothing at all to do with the implicit nature of interfaces. It is in fact a pretty straightforward consequence of the fact that functions are first-class types. Because they&#x27;re types, you can newtype them, and you can implement interfaces on the newtype. This should work in any language that has interfaces and first-class functions.<p>For reference, here&#x27;s the exact same thing in Rust:<p><pre><code>    // Define trait Foo, this is the equivalent of an interface\n    pub trait Foo {\n        fn foo(&self, x: int) -> int;\n    }\n\n    // Define a newtype called FooFunc\n    pub struct FooFunc(fn(x:int) -> int);\n\n    // Explicitly implement the trait on FooFunc\n    impl Foo for FooFunc {\n        fn foo(&self, x: int) -> int {\n            let &FooFunc(f) = self; // unwrap the newtype\n            f(x)\n        }\n    }\n\n    // This is a method that uses a Foo, analogous to http.Handle()\n    pub fn doFoo<T: Foo>(f: T) {\n        println!(&quot;foo(42) = {}&quot;, f.foo(42));\n    }\n\n    // Here&#x27;s our function that we want to wrap\n    fn MyFoo(x: int) -> int {\n        x+1\n    }\n\n    fn main() {\n        // Call the function, just like http.Handle using http.HandlerFunc\n        doFoo(FooFunc(MyFoo));\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd just like Go, this ends up being free at runtime.",1398580522

Once we gain it back, then Lyft, Uber, and the like (as one example) can shift from drivers that drive around looking for rides (which is hardly sharing so much as a homegrown taxi), into truly picking up people when convenient for their usual routes<p>You say this as if it would be a step forward instead of a huge step back. The whole idea of a market economy is that you can trade what you have for what you want, <i>even if the person who has what you want doesn&#x27;t want what you have</i>. Money is used to facilitate this kind of indirect trade.

I won&#x27;t bother to use it even on the rare occasion when the football stadium is where I want to go.

The person you refer to is a &quot;facilitator&quot; or manager. Leader don&#x27;t always have to &quot;facilitate&quot; or manage. The <i>manager</i> is almost never the <i>true leader</i>. Leaders should bring the <i>vision</i> AND set the <i>direction</i> AND provide the <i>main motivation</i> (if one person doesn&#x27;t bring all 3, then you have a collective leadership situation, which is probably the most healthy anyway).<p>In this example, the actual <i>leader</i> is the unseen person that actually identified that bug as &quot;critical&quot; and decided that the software should in under no circumstances be released without that bug fixed!<p>(or if we want to find a leader here, at this level, it would be whoever came up with the idea of &quot;what to look for in order to fix the bug&quot; - Martha may have had the idea herself, most likely, or she may have fished it from the discussion happening around her and just happened to be the first one lucky to find the bug while following this &quot;fished&quot; strategy)",1398578963
