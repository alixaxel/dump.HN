7558619,comment,7558227,7558227,3,0,pwg,,,"> Having read through RFC 6520, I don&#x27;t understand why the payload is necessary. Neither the server nor the client appears to be using it for anything?<p>RFC 6520:<p><pre><code>  &quot;To perform PMTU discovery, HeartbeatRequest messages\n   containing padding can be used as probe packets, as described in\n   [RFC4821].&quot;\n\n  &quot;In particular, after a number of retransmissions without\n   receiving a corresponding HeartbeatResponse message having the\n   expected payload, the DTLS connection SHOULD be terminated. &quot;\n\n  &quot;When a HeartbeatRequest message is received and sending a\n   HeartbeatResponse is not prohibited as described elsewhere in this\n   document, the receiver MUST send a corresponding HeartbeatResponse\n   message carrying an exact copy of the payload of the received\n   HeartbeatRequest.\n\n   If a received HeartbeatResponse message does not contain the expected\n   payload, the message MUST be discarded silently.  If it does contain\n   the expected payload, the retransmission timer MUST be stopped.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThe &quot;use&quot; of the payload is in the RFC.  What the RFC omits is the &quot;why&quot; for why the payload exists in the first place.  Omission of this &quot;why&quot; is likely because the authors expected that their readers would inherently understand why given that the RFC is for network protocols and meant to be read by those understanding network protocols.<p>The &quot;why&quot; is that networks are subject to packet loss, and to timing delays.  If you send out two heartbeats 10s apart, and only receive one reply back, then is the reply responsive to the first heartbeat, or to the second 10s later?  Without some unique data in each of the packets you send, which is echoed by the other end, you can not disambiguate this question.<p>Now, one could argue that a simple sequence counter defined by the protocol would suffice.  But that is open to exploit by a misbehaving server because once the server recognizes your heartbeat counter pattern, it can issue anticipatory heartbeat replies with the proper sequence number that you will accept as valid.  By making the payload arbitrary bytes, then you have the option of sending a sequence number, or generating random data (and tracking it yourself), or both.  The random data aspect thwarts misbehaving servers from determining your pattern and replying with the right data without ever receiving your requests.  The arbitrary sized payload also makes the packet useful for path MTU discovery as the first paragraph I quoted from the RFC indicates.",1397041177
7558618,comment,7557570,7557570,1,0,c0w,,,"> I have no willpower to do anything in any of my non-major courses.<p>If you&#x27;re not motivated enough to buy textbooks and work through them on your own I&#x27;d suggest looking around for a trade school that will allow you to specialize in programming. Your coursework will be pure programming.<p>> I want to just work on something for someone.<p>As a sophomore it is unlikely that you have the necessary skills to do much of anything for anyone, software-wise. Why not start a few projects of your own and learn as you go?<p>> Living at home is the last option I want to explore.<p>It&#x27;s probably your best option, in my opinion. With your lack of coding skills its very unlikely that you&#x27;ll be able to find a programming job, leaving low-paid, low-skilled jobs as your only other option. Working a 9-to-5 is tiring and it will be very hard to find the motivation to come home from work, study, and code. Why not live with the parents for a few years while you teach yourself how to program? Free room and board is a pretty sweet deal.<p>> Is there some sort of person I can talk to about how to go about getting a job<p>There are always mid-clients/recruiters and monster.com, dice.com, etc. With the little amount of programming skills that you have, no real resume, and no portfolio it will be difficult.",1397041158

I guess there&#x27;s some logic in making the protocol the same irrespective of underlying transport, but the payload is completely redundant for reliable protocols, which will handle any retransmission or reordering automatically.<p>Edit: Upon further (amateur and arguably ill-informed) reflection I&#x27;d argue that the heartbeat functionality shouldn&#x27;t apply to TLS at all. It&#x27;s needless complexity that can be handled by the underlying reliable transport. That doesn&#x27;t change that the OpenSSL project clearly has code-quality issues, but it would have averted this particular fiasco, at least.<p>I am dismayed that a security-oriented protocol isn&#x27;t focused on minimalast design.
