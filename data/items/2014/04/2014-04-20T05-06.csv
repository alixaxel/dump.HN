It is unlikely the interviewers share the &quot;passed &quot; assessment. We interview a lot and often run the candidates through multiple interviews and tests, before making a go no-go decision. Your decision is likely the cumulative of the multiple interviews. Don&#x27;t feel bad about it, life&#x27;s short, move on, There are plenty of companies hiring for software engineers.",1397973590

I bought a silver ring with one of their sapphires ($100 or so) that I&#x27;ve worn almost every day since, and a larger loose sapphire that I never did anything with but still have lying around somewhere.<p>Van Pler, I think they called themselves.  They disappeared without a trace a couple of years later.  I don&#x27;t know if they used CVD or some other process.<p>The stones are obviously synthetic -- from the right angle you can see banding suggesting that the color dopant was added in layers -- but reasonably attractive nonetheless.  In fact, they have a deep, pure blue color the natural stones don&#x27;t seem to achieve, at least not for any price I could afford :-)",1397973208

In general I cringe a little every time I hear Computer Science people should focus on &quot;discrete math&quot;, because without tools from analysis you can only solve the most trivial discrete problems. And yes, calculus by itself is hardly ever applicable in CS, yet you still have to learn it, tough luck. In general what is not stressed enough I think is that applying math is hard and you need to learn a lot of it before you have enough tools to tackle problems anywhere close to real-world complexity.<p>The top answer also lists random concepts. I am learning probability currently, for applications in machine learning. &quot;Discrete spaces, Bayes theorem and expected values&quot; you can learn in a day, &quot;Markovs, Chebyshev and Chernoff inequalities&quot; are mostly only useful for further theoretical work, so is &quot;the law of large numbers&quot;. What will really be useful will depend a lot on the applications, if you are a theoretical computer scientist, mastery of generating functions and transforms will be useful, and it&#x27;s one of those instances where discrete problems are solved via tools from calculus/analysis. For machine learning you need to know everything about the normal distribution by heart, and this means you have to know everything about the exponential function by heart, so again back to calculus. Notions from information theory are useful, but of course none of the ones he listed. The comment &quot;This is a must for modern programmers.&quot; sounds just comic.",1397972651

7615971,comment,7613752,7615612,1,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"Well, I would agree that the non-encryption of end-to-end headers with PGP is somewhat of a bug.<p>Other than that, I think those are all examples of problems that are not actually email problems.<p>Whether you can force TLS/STARTTLS doesn&#x27;t really matter. First, you cannot ever force anyone to keep something secret, they can always publish a secret that they know somehow and thus make it not be a secret anymore. You can always offer STARTTLS though, so if the other side wants to keep a secret secret from eavesdroppers, they then can do so. That does not help against People in the Middle, of course, as they can strip out the STARTTLS offer. But being able to &quot;force&quot; STARTTLS doesn&#x27;t help you either, as that would only force the middleperson to speak TLS to you. If you wanted to force authenticated communication that protects you from MitM, you would first have to set up some authentication mechanism. On a server-by-server basis, you can already do that. If you wanted to do it globally, we would need a reliable global PKI. Such a thing does not exist and is extremely hard to build--and in particular, it&#x27;s not an &quot;email problem&quot;. Reliable authentication is mostly a hard social problem.<p>As for metadata encryption: Well, that pretty much is impossible by definition, except maybe through mix networks. You cannot simply encrypt the information that needs to be readable in order to route the message to the destination. Even if you deliver a message via TLS to my MX, the mere fact that your mail server looks up my domain MX and then connects to it already tells an eavesdropper all the meta information there is. And if you solve that by instead doing all the routing inside gmail or some other big provider, you obviously haven&#x27;t solved anything, as now google can see, sell, and be subpoenaed for this information.<p>Also, &quot;security&quot; is a word without any meaning. You can only be secure against particular attacks/risks, and securing a system against a particular risk often is in conflict with securing it against another risk, so you can only ever achieve one or the other, and it&#x27;s often a difficult decision which risk to take. In the case of email, you could very easily secure the system against spam, for example: Just have a government agency that licences email server operators and shuts down any that engage in spamming. The side effect: Email is not the slightest bit secure against government censorship anymore. And yet again, there is a social problem at the core, not a technical one.<p>There are reasons why email is so &quot;insecure&quot;. And as I wrote above: It&#x27;s not that people didn&#x27;t think about it. It&#x27;s more likely that those who suggest that starting over could help solving the problems haven&#x27;t really thought through it. In particular the &quot;security&quot; problems of email are extremely hard problems, and they are hard for social and political reasons, not for technical reasons.",1397971817

I personally think that weddings are already taken for other signals, though since language drifts, these signals could as well.<p>This is entirely anecdotal, but currently there are big, expensive and pragmatic weddings. These lavish wedding party tends to be signaling for the family in relation to others in a diaspora situation. As an American, I think our concept of &quot;love&quot; and Christianity have blurred the original point of marriages which have existed for long before our current Victorian ideals.<p>As an example: a friend of mine is ethnically Cambodian, and weddings in her social circle tend to be orchestrated on reputation as well as connection. IE, at the wedding participants will leave an envelope with the name of the clan who gifted it. Supposedly the bride and groom (or, possibly their family members) will spend part of the wedding accounting for the debts to neighbors. Her wedding, largely put together by her father, involved more than 500 people of a group that is not very populous in my area.<p>As she put it, lavish weddings were fundraisers for capital investments for members in a spread-out community.

The idea is to ensure that no packets with identical hashes are in flight on any core at the same time.<p>If programmed correctly, this work scheduling prevents data structure contention, which is particularly problematic when you scale to 32 (and next-gen up to 48 [then I believe to 64] cores).<p>The chips also support direct packet transport (XAUI, SGMII, etc), rather than requiring transport across PCI-e.  Each of these ports can be programmed separately, so you can use switch-specific goofy encapsulation modes (Broadcom HiGig2, Marvell DSA, etc) to support very quick traffic <-> physical port mappings.<p>I should also mention that Cavium scales down very well, all of the way to configurations like 2 cores at 400Mhz for PoS, SOHO usage, and such.  So it can be an attractive architecture to target.<p>Finally, Octeon family MIPS64 has a lot of MIPS64 extensions, like branch on bit, posted atomic operations (e.g. statistics, where you don&#x27;t care about the value, you just want to += 42 it), pop count, fast bitfield subfield extract, etc.",1397971630

7615960,comment,7615273,7615695,7,0,MertsA,,,"I just did and if you were okay with a 0.001 probability of false positive you could list all 500,000 (possibly way off) certificates potentially exposed through heartbleed in only 877.5KB of space. The current Chrome CRL contains 24,161 serial numbers and takes up 305.3KB of space. While it isn&#x27;t a perfect fix for the revocation problem it would certainly be much better than the status quo.<p>One problem might be that the 0.1% of sites hit by the false positive effectively couldn&#x27;t use OCSP stapling but Chrome could just first call back to Google as a CRL proxy to avoid making an OCSP request when the site stapled a valid but potentially revoked OCSP response. Then just store that response from Google for current version of CRL in the cache. End result is that the unlucky false positive sites don&#x27;t have tons of unnecessary (unnecessary as far as the OCSP spec is concerned) OCSP requests going to the CAs and the only thing they would notice is that a new visitior takes 100ms longer to make the first page load.<p>And through the magic of bloom filters if you wanted to bump the false positive rate down to 1 in 10,000 it only bloats the list to 1.14MB. Furthermore, there are methods to make the bloom filter scale-able such that a client doesn&#x27;t have to necessarily download the whole bloom filter again if a bunch of elements are added to it and instead just download a portion of the data required for a full update.<p>The more I think about it the more I wonder why this isn&#x27;t already in Chrome in some form or another. The only downside is weird networks where OCSP might be filtered, but not https, and access to Google is filtered.<p>Edit: One thing I feel stupid for overlooking is that Bloom filters aren&#x27;t cryptographically secure so an attacker could theoretically find a serial number for some CA that would cause a site to always be a false positive but I don&#x27;t think any CAs are still giving out serial numbers in a predictable way after the MD5 debacle and even if they were it would seem to be impractical to me. The fix would just be do a SHA256 hash of the serial instead of the serial itself.",1397971315
