Similar to the above anecdote.<p>No one gets upset with the person who <i>can&#x27;t</i> help them. They get upset when the person <i>who can help them doesn&#x27;t</i>. Additionally people tend to focus on what you haven&#x27;t done yet, not what you&#x27;ve already accomplished. The more that you are able to do, the larger the unfulfilled expectations become.

But in order to have a viable alternative to that &quot;bad&quot; technology, you need other people (case in point: mindshare of JS). In order to get more people to &quot;your side&quot;, you might need to point out what is wrong with the original technology.<p>> But for heaven&#x27;s sake, if you&#x27;re not going to improve on it, stop whining about it and be grateful for the amazing things it does enable.<p>Sometimes you&#x27;re not in a position to even be able to change something, even if you wanted to. The ideas you have in mind for a technology might fly in the face of how the community around that technology, or the guardians/maintainers of it, thinks of it - introducing these changes might break too much stuff that is dependent on it, the changes might fly in the face of the culture around that technology.<p>So if you have some technology that you think - subjectively, or even somewhat objectively if you have conviction enough - and you can not do anything about it, you only have two choices. Embrace it and try to work with it despite its flaws, or to <i>abandon ship</i>.<p>But if you want to abandon ship, you probably want to find a safe harbor, eventually. ie a place where you can develop or utilize some other technology. But that place might be sparsely populated, because everyone else is working with that other technology. So what do you do? You suggest that others <i>jump ship</i>. :)<p>Assuming that there is actually some kind of objective merit to complain about a specific technology, it might be wise to <i>complain</i> to others about that technology. That way they can hopefully use that info to make an informed choice, and perhaps abandon their current technology for another technology. In time, you might even get enough people to come over to this other technology that that community is big enough to support that technology as a valid alternative to the &quot;bad&quot; technology. But what if everyone just stfu&#x27;ed about what their &quot;negative&quot; thoughts are on a technology? Would that other technology be able to get enough &quot;acolytes&quot; in order to be a viable alternative? Probably not, because everyone was too &quot;positive&quot; and polite to point out how that technology might be better than the old technology.<p>Would JS even be so controversial if it wasn&#x27;t for that it is so entrenched in Web development?

Think of everything you can do with openCL then take the subset of that which is applicable to games, or spreadsheets, or novelty,- a non-trivial amount- and make that portable via browsers to create a much better experience for you and target users. Worst case is it provides an easier to use way to learn opencl for beginners in that area.<p>If I remember correctly, and I may be terribly incorrect, the MIT jersey kids were going to have you mine bitcoins instead of look at ads; I think it got shot down due to ability to abuse it rather than inherent badness.",1397863911

Maybe not obscenely large ones (I&#x27;m looking at you, Salesforce), but all the prizes at major university hackathons seem totally reasonable.<p>A well-organized hackathon is fairly bifurcated. You have new hackers who are there to learn and experienced hackers who want to tackle an ambitious project. For both groups, I think large cash prizes are useful. For the newbies, even if they&#x27;re not planning to win, the prizes reinforce the message that hacking is something useful and worth pursuing (helping to counteract the societal narrative of geeks being lame).

What&#x27;s their turnover for engineers in a year?  10%?  15%?  The definitionally average startup has a higher turnover <i>even if we restrict it to turnover caused by business failure</i>, to say nothing of voluntarily or involuntarily losing one&#x27;s job.<p>If you exit a position with Google/etc, you have a network full of people who also spent the last couple of years at Google.  You can easily lateral into jobs of comparable quality.  If you exit a position with a failed startup, your lateral transfer is likely into another job which pays below market.  Your immediate professional peers are also people trying to avoid the failure stigma.  They may also be slightly busy looking for a job to help you with your own job search.<p>If you work for Google for 2 years and then separate from them, your 401k increased by $30k in the interim and you probably have six figures sitting in the bank account.  If your startup is shot out from under you, you may end up counting the number of ramen boxes in the pantry while hoping that the startup can make good on its final payroll check.<p>If you work for a megacorp and are let go, it is highly likely that you were let go for firm- or individual-specific reasons rather than industry-wide calamity.  This is very much not guaranteed in startups, where e.g. ebbs and flows of the capital market can cause a daisy cutter to hit the hiring pipelines at dozens of firms at once.  You could lose your job at the same time that everyone else stops hiring.

At the other side, Pinterest offers me 30,000 RSUs which I turned down because I thought Pinterest was already a late stage company.<p>But after I did these researches (including this post), I am wondering if I made a right decision? my 13,000 shares will always be 13,000 shares, no matter how much dilution we have in future, right? so does it mean even if my company grew to the size of Pinterest in future, I still only have that 13,000 shares instead of 30,000 I could get from Pinterest easily with less risk?<p>Or all late stage startup companies have split their stocks otherwise I don&#x27;t see how joining a early startup for 13,000 would be any better",1397862875
7611818,comment,7611747,7611747,1,0,kandalf,,,"I generally agree with the sentiment. I think it&#x27;s very easy to each year just look at the standard prize amounts and decide that slightly beating the standard can&#x27;t hurt, but over time that leads to higher and higher prizes. Certainly $1 million is absurd. We (PennApps) are at $10k for 1st place, which I think you could argue is high (keep in mind that turns into $2.5k/person). But we made a conscious decision not to raise our prize any more than that about a year ago, so at least it&#x27;s not getting worse on our end.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that giving already released hardware as the main prizes is a good idea. From my point of view, people don&#x27;t choose to compete for the main prizes like they do for sponsor ones, and forcing them to take an Oculus Rift or something of the like that they could just buy if they wanted seems a little suboptimal. However, getting unreleased hardware is a value add in my book, and was something we considered for the latest PennApps with Myo, although they couldn&#x27;t make the delivery date in the end.<p>Sponsor prizes are tricky. One thing we&#x27;ve done at PennApps is encourage more vaguely themed prizes rather than ones that reward the use of a specific company&#x27;s API. OTOH, we&#x27;re not ready to entirely restrict API-centric prizes since I do believe that for less &quot;sexy&quot; companies it is a value add (the writers behind this article both came from arguably &quot;sexy&quot; companies), and the competition for sponsor dollars is such that the negatives mentioned in the article about sponsor prizes do not outweigh the cost of removing them for us.",1397862862

7611803,comment,7610586,7611077,1,0,schoen,,,"As someone who has been captivated by studying related languages and noticing similarities between them, I think the way that learning one language &quot;helps&quot; with learning a related language can be quite narrow.  The main benefit is probably a built-in set of mnemonics for cognates (whether at the word level or the morpheme level).<p>For example, if you&#x27;ve learned the Latin verb conjugation endings -o -s -t -mus -tis -nt, you have a useful starting point for memorizing the Spanish equivalents -o -s -ø -mos -is -n (which derived from them), or the Portuguese equivalents -o -s -ø -mos -is -m, or French -ø -s -ø -ns -z -nt, and so on.  Similarly, the numbers provide good mnemonics: Latin unus duo tres quattuor quinque sex ..., Spanish uno dos tres cuatro cinco seis ...<p>Similarly, if you know the personal pronouns in one Semitic language like Arabic or Hebrew, you&#x27;ve got a major boost for learning them in another because they&#x27;re extremely similar:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_languages#Independent_personal_pronouns"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_languages#Independent_...</a><p>But in each case you still have a lot of memorization because there will be sound changes and lexical changes that are not predictable a priori, include extreme cases like suppletion, where one verb partially replaces another.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppletion#Examples"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suppletion#Examples</a><p>In the programming context suppletion might be as if someone started implementing an API from one language and then decided to use a different API as the basis for half of the function names.<p>I think learning many natural languages (whether related or not) helps because it builds up your conceptual framework  and repertoire for how things can work, especially in terms of syntax and morphosyntax.  For example, Indo-European languages have a wide range of ways of using participles and infinitives (some of them different from the ways that English speakers are familiar with), and seeing a few of these can help with understanding how they work in other languages.  Or there&#x27;s relative clause structure (like &quot;the first foreign language <i>that I studied</i>&quot;) and indirect discourse (&quot;she felt <i>that natural languages and programming languages were similar</i>&quot;), which are handled quite differently in different languages, and it&#x27;s helpful to get a sense of some of the ways that these things can happen.<p>Maybe a programming language analogy would be ideas like indexing starting from zero, which is not necessarily always used in every context in every single language, but which is an important concept to know about.  Or list comprehensions or anonymous functions, which are again not available in every language but which are useful to understand.  Or lexical vs. dynamic variable scope. :-)<p>A given programming language can in theory make totally arbitrary choices about these things at the whim of its designer, but in any case it will probably do most things in a way that&#x27;s conceptually related to at least some other programming languages that have come before.",1397862557

I thought maybe it was religious, but I now think it has more to do with lunar cycles being close to 28 days and that predating any religious foundation.<p>12 months has the benefit of dividing the seasons into 3 month quarters. However having an uneven number of days per month and with the solstices and equinoxes falling somewhat haphazardly on the calendar, this doesn&#x27;t seem like a good reason to stick with the current system.<p>As long as we&#x27;re redesigning the calendar system, I think the solstice and the equinox should fall in the middle of a season with the Winter Solstice effectively marking the start of the calendar year as a holiday. The leap day could be the day that proceeds that, effectively being used as a day to mark the end of the year. Seasons would then define periods of similar daylight.<p>The only reasons not to adopt this sort of calendar are ceremonial. Having a 13 month calendar simplifies so much from financial calculations to having consistent day of week/month boundaries that I can&#x27;t see any real down sides.<p>I have no idea how to promote widespread adoption of a new calendar, but it is something I&#x27;ve thought about a lot.",1397862250
