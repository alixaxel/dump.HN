It&#x27;s a balance, if I am getting a lot of good mentoring, I wouldn&#x27;t mind doing some tedious tasks every now and then (documentation etc), because overall I am likely learning more than I would on my own.<p>Details / longer version:<p>I&#x27;m a software engineer, based in Denmark (Aarhus), completed university roughly a year ago. I don&#x27;t get to do much actual coding in my job (the coding itself is mostly outsourced), and the little coding I do for work is Java. In my free time I enjoy working on hobby projects or thinking up projects I would like to do - my backlog of project ideas is quite long :). Lately I&#x27;ve gotten to a point where I start actually finishing my projects, where previously I would move on to the next thing before getting far. Projects so far have been nothing with any monetary value, strictly for fun/learning.<p>The problem is I feel like I&#x27;m missing out on a lot of valuable experience, motivation and fun by doing these things alone. I&#x27;m not looking for somebody to help me with MY projects, I&#x27;m looking for some person or group who I can share my progress with and follow their projects, possibly joining up to work on the same project if interests collide on something.<p>Topics I&#x27;m interested in learning more about (<i>italic</i> = no practical experience with language/platform yet):<p>- Functional programming languages (especially Clojure, Erlang and <i>Haskell</i> at the moment)<p>- Web frameworks (django, rails, grails and similar frameworks for other languages)<p>- Mobile development (Android, maybe <i>Tizen</i> - not iOS)<p>- Non-relational DBMS&#x27;s (<i>Cassandra</i>, <i>Riak</i>, Mongo, Couch etc)<p>- Designing architecture for high-availability / scalability",1397295347

I don&#x27;t think you can argue that children have no bearing on marriage whatsoever.<p>Especially since presumably the &quot;right to adopt&quot; is the main issue people have with gay marriage. Don&#x27;t know about the US, but where I live, the only other significant right married people get is bringing their spouses into the country (giving them citizenship). Things like &quot;visit your spouse in hospital&quot; or &quot;split your income for tax reductions&quot; can be arranged in other ways.<p>&quot;this is a question of discrimination of the most basic kind.&quot;<p>That is just hate speech, not an argument.<p>&quot;That there is a bigger problem compared to gay marriage doesn&#x27;t negate the fact that some people are still being denied the ability to marry and access the rights that come with that status.&quot;<p>Of course not - my point is that many who now feel like &quot;good people&quot; because they support gay marriage at the same time fight for denying people health care.
