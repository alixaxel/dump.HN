7638704,comment,7636734,7638324,1,0,mwfunk,,,"That&#x27;s all true, I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as huge a factor as a lot of people think it is. If one OS market share is so small that the result is very, very few good apps being written for it, and many big-name apps are not available for it (like Twitter or Facebook or Candy Crush or whatever), that&#x27;s a big problem. But up until that point, it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>For example, IMO Windows Phone has a much smaller app store than iOS or Android, but it&#x27;s big enough that the size of the app store is probably not going to be the #1 factor (or even in the top 5) when someone is deciding what kind of phone to get.<p>Consumers might say &quot;I don&#x27;t want Windows Phone because Windows Phone isn&#x27;t appealing to me&quot;, but it&#x27;s probably past the point where very many people would say, &quot;I really like Windows Phone but won&#x27;t get one because there aren&#x27;t enough apps.&quot; Point being, Windows Phone is a very distant third behind Android and iOS in terms of market share. It&#x27;s in the low single digits in market share, but that&#x27;s still enough to get over the adequate-app-store hump (IMO at least).<p>So, I&#x27;m not denying that market share is essential to drawing developers, I just don&#x27;t know if the market share extremes are ever going to get big enough to have an impact on iOS vs. Android.<p>My main objection is when people (and I&#x27;m not accusing you of this) slip into there-can-only-be-one-ishness, where there is an implicit notion that the market being discussed is a natural monopoly, and that the ultimate outcome is inevitably a market share horse race that leaves only one company standing. The argument is always that whoever has the most market share gets more apps, and whoever gets more apps gets more market share, resulting in a natural tendency towards a last man standing situation.<p>This was such a huge theme in the &#x27;90s in the computer industry- so many people just assumed that market share alone would cause Windows to completely take over to a much greater degree than it has. Mac OS would just vanish, and Linux would turn out to be just a fad amongst CS undergrads. Of course, Microsoft still has a monopoly, in the sense that it has 90%+ market share pretty much any way you look at it, but that&#x27;s a lot different than 100.0% market share that people were predicting it would have. That leaves plenty of room for OS X and Linux and others to find their niche, and those niches are frequently more profitable and/or interesting than the mass market that Microsoft has covered so thoroughly. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the mobile world shook out in a similar way, long-term.",1398318936

They did a big stock split partly to change the numbers in stock option offers. Apparently it was much more enticing to offer candidates options for 2000 shares at $10 per share.

7638677,comment,7638099,7638531,3,0,comex,,,"But what kind of patent infringement cases and/or notable patent avoidance in computing do we actually see in practice?  Off the top of my head:<p>- patent trolls, lots and lots of patent trolls, throwing around patents for things like in-app purchases and SSL<p>- Samsung and Apple throwing random patents at each other and mostly not accomplishing anything<p>- file systems - FAT LFN, exFAT<p>- machine instruction sets<p>- video codecs<p>- ClearType<p>Out of those examples, the first two are clearly awful, and the second two are pretty bad because they prevent compatibility/competition.  The last two are relatively OK - with video codecs patent <i>uncertainty</i> is very damaging, but as long as we&#x27;re hypothetically revamping the system we can fix that.<p>But the last two are also pretty unimportant compared to the software industry as a whole; keeping or abolishing them wouldn&#x27;t make a huge difference to anyone other than MPEG LA.  I&#x27;ll make a bit of an extrapolation and claim that after factoring out undesirable use of software patents, the same would apply to abolishing them entirely: there would be little effect, because patents never effectively prevented ripoffs in the first place.  Yet in the present, plenty of companies focus plenty of effort on R&D.  Why they&#x27;d do so without patents is the same as why they do so today: most significant functionality takes a lot of time and work to implement, so being first is a large competitive advantage.<p>I guess we&#x27;re not restricted to looking at what&#x27;s currently patentable; if you really wanted to discourage ripoffs, you could expand the patent system along those lines at the same time as weakening the current system.  But personally, today&#x27;s patents are dangerous enough that any thought of expansion really scares me.",1398318404

Then I deploy the app. When deploy is complete and prod nodes are ready I add them back to the ELB and remove the reserve nodes.  The deployment is seamless but this is not a convenient trick - it required a fair bit of custom scripting... Luckily AWS provides great APIs to make all this stuff possible.",1398317710

Apple, for better or worse, has entered that realm.  Therefore, if they trade significantly below their cash-flow value, those investors will buy up the stock, if they trade significantly above it, those investors will sell the stock (or short it if things get too far out of whack) - It doesn&#x27;t matter if the stock is selling for $100, $1000, or $10,000/share.<p>But, the people who run Apple have access to the best advice that money can buy, and they have made this decision - what I&#x27;m interested in, ideally from someone who has worked behind the scenes in this kind of really-big-company stock split, is the <i>real</i> reason why this is done.  I have a theory it&#x27;s a mechanism to reward bankers with a lot of business with useless make-work, in return for getting positive ratings moving forward - but I&#x27;m open to other theories.<p>[Edit - another Theory is that Tim Cook and/or his CFO Peter Oppenheimer are just fed up with being asked about a stock split, and given that the stock split is an absolutely meaningless event, that has no negative/positive impact on the company value, but will eliminate the ongoing nagging of people about it, just decided to eliminate that annoyance.  My counter argument to that would be is by giving people something meaningless to complain or ask about, you distract them from other things that you would prefer they not spend so much time on - so it&#x27;s good to leave a few of these around as decoys.]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_bar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_bar</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.bullionvault.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bullionvault.com/</a>",1398317509

But as we all know, the process of replacing faith with reason was not something that was decided upon and implemented.<p>I think you need to go back to the history books. That&#x27;s pretty much what happened during the French revolution. Religion wasn&#x27;t the only factor, of course, there was nobility + state versus poor + merchants class warfare involved. But religion was seen, in France, to be solidly on the wrong side, with &quot;laicite&quot; as the result.<p>Problem is that they proceeded to place lots of people with no affection whatsoever to the religion, or the nation, or anything outside of themselves really, in control of the state. They literally threw out the existing people (usually after separating head and body of the individuals concerned), and replaced them near-wholesale. The result, as we all should know, but don&#x27;t, was a monstrous, valueless, cruel and unlivable state, very quickly resulting in another revolution (generally referred to as &quot;stage 2&quot; or &quot;stage 3&quot; of the french revolution itself), which brought Napoleon to power, who was very much part of the wrong side in the previous stage of the revolution. People were clamoring for religion, values and the like because the valueless, morale-less bureaucrats behavior.<p>I think the enlightenment, if you look at actual history is very much a lesson in both how a religious based society doesn&#x27;t work, and a religion-less society doesn&#x27;t work either. Not that these lessons apply directly today, but I do think it&#x27;s fair to say that France demonstrated very clearly to everyone that you can&#x27;t live dominated by a religion, but you can&#x27;t live without religion either.<p>You probably think that this &quot;anti-religion&quot; movement is something new, but I think once you study history, you&#x27;ll find yourself to be on the very moderate anti-religious side of this argument (compared to the beginning of the 19th century). I think you&#x27;ll also read about what happened when policies like the ones you&#x27;re suggesting are actually implemented, and I think you&#x27;ll agree that &quot;enlightened&quot; is certainly not universally better than what you&#x27;d probably call &quot;stuck in the middle ages&quot;.
