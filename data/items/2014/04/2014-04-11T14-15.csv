Its definitely a Catch-22 scenario, but things like retweeting and favoriting can help you build that network without doing stuff that feels too weird.

A good usability person can put him/her-self in someone else&#x27;s shoes, rather than assume everyone else thinks like they do. Since software engineers think very differently from most people good usability people are rare. (Steve Jobs was actually such a person. People forget he knew enough programming and electronics to be dangerous.)<p>I&#x27;m not a usability person, never claimed to be. I am a user who is sharing his experience with using ipods.

I have never, ever touched a terminal unless I absolutely have to, right up until about my second year as a programmer, which learnt as an adult. I still think that things like terminals are overrated as far as streamlined work flow goes.<p>> The thing Apple did with the iPod was offer a seamless end-to-end user experience, to allow &quot;normal&quot; people to buy a song and have it appear on their devices legally, simply, and at a reasonable price. This involved software, UI design, hardware design, negotiating compromises with the RIAA (e.g. iPods did not simply act as a file system to prevent casual piracy while not seriously inconveniencing users). This combination of software, hardware, design, and legal wrangling was not replicated by anyone, even approximately, for several years (Sony and Microsoft eventually managed to get something vaguely comparable, but it was too little too late.)<p>I haven&#x27;t had the impression that ipods were such a revolution. Maybe it has to do with where I live.<p>I&#x27;ll concede that the ipod was clearly simpler for people who thought dragging and dropping to a USB like thing was intimidating, and at the same time couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t/had moral qualms about pirating music.

Reagan and all the almost flawless propaganda that accompanied his administration, the Japanese electronics boom, the endless stream of 80s style propaganda action movies, the huge surge in religious upswelling at that moment against the godless communists, the space program, Star Wars (the military program and the movies), endless cartoons reinforcing these values and ideas down at a child&#x27;s level (G.I. Joe, Transformers, Gobots, etc.) the emergence of video games, hair bands, the endless parade of spy movies, and then spy movies where video games played a prominent role. It&#x27;s pretty remarkable how many popular franchises were started and established in the 80s that are still wildly popular today and the thousands more that have vanished. I get a sense that it far surpassed the decade prior or after in that respect.<p>It was a really special kind of holistic life-pastiche that I don&#x27;t think really existed before or sense. The closest I can think of is the late 50s early 60s as being quite so cohoesive and holistic.<p>I experienced it as a child growing up, so my take on the 80s is from that angle, but when I walk around the toy section at my local store these days, it&#x27;s like a pale shadow of the vibrancy from that time -- most of the <i>really</i> popular toys are still more or less the ones that came into popularity when I was a kid. It seems like most of the big franchises from the 90s (the last time I really had awareness of the toy section) have died off or been replaced.<p>My wife is South Korean, and when she grew up, her country was just emerging from a long dictatorship. The popular media was heavily controlled and given their neighbor, was almost a more intense version of what we had in the 80s.

It parses the extension fields it knows about, but if you want to know more than those, you&#x27;ll have to dig into ASN.1 yourself.<p>* Related to the previous point: I couldn&#x27;t find support in converting different ASN.1 string formats. Probably will have to depend on another library to do that.<p>* I found a buffer overflow bug within a few hours of working with it [1], which is really not a good sign for a TLS library. However, it did get acknowledged within 24 hours (I&#x27;ve got an OpenSSL patch which has been sitting on their bugtracker without any reply for 6 months).<p>* Setting a different curve for ECC requires a compile time flag to be set, which is disabled by default.<p>* Using the server&#x27;s cipher order or the client&#x27;s is also a compile time flag, can not be set at run time.<p>[1] = <a href=""https://github.com/polarssl/polarssl/issues/83"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/polarssl/polarssl/issues/83</a>",1397226134

Each has only one designated ChucK input and/or output. This makes it difficult to truly experiment with modulation. You pretty quickly reach a point where you end up writing the same old procedural code you&#x27;d write in C or Java, explicitly manipulating samples instead of streams.<p>There are many other systems that are similar, including SuperCollider, Max/MSP, PureData, CSound and JSyn/JMSL.<p>I think the intuition behind ChucK is similar to the functional reactive programming of Elm [1].

It never made sense to me so I didn&#x27;t carry that around with me.<p>Instead I became deeply skeptical of my parent&#x27;s ability to parse these kinds of issues out for my well being. Which of course led to all kinds of wonderful moments as a teenager ;)<p>Over the years I also discovered that my mother was deeply susceptible to counter-mainstream, alternative movements. So I also grew up with all kinds of weird fad diet of the year, carb-load, bran, high citrus, vegetarian, soy, uncooked veggies, low-carb, acai, quinoa, dozens of others, or a stint where we all did Chinese medicine and ate lots of ginseng or a brief stint with homeopathy. No surprise my mother eats gluten free today but I suspect that&#x27;s about to change as the next fad diet starts to infiltrate popular culture - Metabolism B, Dash, Paleo whatever. I usually indulged her at home (after all some of the diets were pretty tasty) and just ignored it all when I was out on my own.<p>More importantly it&#x27;s made me very skeptical whenever large groups of people cotton onto something. It seems the more intense the group interest in something is, the less I&#x27;m inclined to go along...whatever it is. I grew up almost anti-cool - skeptic kind of personality. It saved me from most of the terrible fashion fads that everybody I grew up with regrets these days.<p>But in terms of what HN would be interested in, I tend not to really &quot;get&quot; large scale trends either -- since I&#x27;ve basically been trained to revolt from them unless there&#x27;s a clear advantage to following it.
