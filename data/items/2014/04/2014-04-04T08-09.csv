7530100,comment,7523953,7523953,17,0,saurik,,,"Am I the only person who sees flat &quot;$X/mo&quot; prices and rapidly adjusts their trust in the provider downwards? It simply doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me that my backup provider (or my bandwidth provider, or my transaction processor, or my Internet company) is providing me &quot;unlimited anything&quot; for any flat amount of money: the pricing is clearly not related to my cost, so either there is some massive flexible margin (which I should now be trying to strongly negotiate against) or their business is based on something I don&#x27;t understand (or worse, that they don&#x27;t understand), neither of which makes me want to trust them with anything seriously important.<p>I want my provider to make money, but I also want to understand their business enough to know whether I&#x27;m a customer that is making them money or one that they are likely to want to drop in the near future. To be clear: I am not complaining about things being expensive (I like paying for things!), and agree that Tarsnap sounds like they aren&#x27;t charging enough for the value that they could provide me, but I want their business model to be transparent (again, so I know they are making money off of me, so I know how to and whether to negotiate, and so I feel comfortable they won&#x27;t shut down their service in a few months when they realize their customer&#x27;s needs changed and suddenly they aren&#x27;t making money anymore), and putting up the standard three price tiers hides all of that from me in a way that makes me nervous.<p>It also isn&#x27;t like most of the really basic services people buy for their businesses are priced like that already: I pay for power by the kilowatt, phone calls by the minute, and bandwidth (for my servers) by the gigabyte. Sometimes the base rate is thrown in (I get 5TB of transfer included with a virtual unmanaged server, for example, not that I&#x27;m using many of those anymore), but very few services I pay for have a fixed flat rate like this. I thereby am having a difficult time appreciating the argument that it would be easier to get a company to pay $100/mo than $5+/-$2 (although maybe the idea is that these numbers are both simply &quot;too small to think much about&quot;, which would be an argument I could appreciate). Most services similar to Colin&#x27;s are priced by usage, not in fixed tiers.<p>To put this in perspective: I seriously have over fifty thousand dollars a month of service costs for my business that I pay based on some variable cost that Patrick is claiming I am somehow not going to be able to calculate and would keep me from using these providers. In addition to the things already mentioned, I pay by the hour for computers (EC2), by the message for e-mail delivery, by both the amount and number for credit card charges (the bulk of my costs), by the sheet of paper and drop of ink for printing, by the gallon or mile for travel, and again by the gigabyte for content delivery (which is somewhat different than the variable bandwidth I&#x27;m spending for my servers). Almost all of the costs of my business are paid for on some variable cost basis, and this is <i>not strange</i> :(.<p>I can actually go further: my &quot;right hand man&quot; is paid by the hour, so a good percentage of my human resource costs are variable as well. This <i>is</i> somewhat strange, sure, but when I was a consultant I was amazed at just how many companies seemed to be entirely staffed by consultants... we&#x27;d go to the business and find out that the don&#x27;t even seem to have employees anymore, they now just are contracting work out to three different consulting firms. Again: billing for time and materials doesn&#x27;t seem to cause companies to go running for the hills, and at this point most of my friends are consultants, they all bill this way, and they all have so much work they are quite picky about their clients. The legal and accounting firms I work with are even more examples of this (and ones where I&#x27;ve spent immense amounts of money over the years).<p>So, I just can&#x27;t get behind this idea that pricing by the byte is somehow a fundamental flaw in Tarsnap&#x27;s business. Maybe it should be 10x more expensive than it is: I can easily see the idea that the price of the service is not commensurate to the value. Maybe it should have some lower tiers with fixed pricing for entry-level usage: but then then top-level tier should be open-ended, &quot;talk to a sales associate&quot;, and negotiated on the gigabyte (again: this is how most services I&#x27;ve seen that are targeting businesses are operated; they don&#x27;t have unlimited tiers, they have limited tiers and then &quot;pay by the X&quot; at the high-end). Maybe it should also have a way to price differentiate different kinds of customers: SLA, support, and purchase orders, all make perfect sense to me. But I just don&#x27;t understand why billing by the month should be considered better than billing by usage.",1396601697

Well gay men can shower with boys in the locker next door, so why not? Why are there women&#x27;s battery laws? Special rape laws only for women? There are literally thousands of laws that are preferential toward or only exist to assist women? Can&#x27;t a gay man have these same laws applied to him just like marriage? It just isn&#x27;t fair if they aren&#x27;t. This breaks &quot;Equality&quot;.<p>Men and women are different, that is why there are different rules for us. Homosexuals did not fit the description of marriage because it was defined by gender, since this fundamental attribute was thrown out, it seems only fair to throw out any and all gender biased laws, rules, and guidelines.<p>If a women feels that she was violated because a man came into the women&#x27;s shower while she was shaving, how is this different than a women feeling that her marriage was violated because it also was re-defined as being genderless.<p>I just don&#x27;t grasp the &quot;logic&quot; (or lack thereof) that people today must use to come up with such thoughts and justifications.",1396601368

If you have budget of several tens of billions and you want to be judicious where you invest, it is unrealistic to expect to create magic in Africa over 100-200 years. In that situation the best you could hope to achieve for that continent is to invest in medicine aka what Bill Gates is doing, and hope that it will help turn the continent from 3rd world to something like Mexico (which is still far from great). And then what hope do you have that once all the work is done that people there won&#x27;t elect someone like Chavez and start beating up students at local universities with baseball bats?<p>> you whitewash over the fact that we ARE in fact much much better-off than most people who have ever lived<p>Perhaps yes, but not if you listen to egalitarian vanguard. Just talk to OWS participants if you don&#x27;t believe me. Though if we are indeed better off, how much of that is a function of technology rather than egalitarianism?<p>> you are looking for profit<p>What do you mean by &quot;looking for profit&quot;? As I said, my (hypothetical) motives are purely altruistic. I have fifty billion dollars and I am willing to spend them all to the last penny. All I want in return is the next Plato/Aristotle/Socrates within the next 100-200 years. Is that too much to ask? How do you interpret this motivation as &quot;profit&quot;? Who profits?<p>> There is no immediate pressure on us to produce Aristotles et. al. because they are not going to bring immediate benefit<p>First of all, it could be argued that someone like Plato has made a huge contribution to Greek and Roman civilizations. Aristotle was the personal tutor of Alexander the Great for God&#x27;s sake. These individuals contributed tremendously, both within their lifetimes and in the millennia after. Second, even if you discount the influence these people had in the Ancient world, and assume that the majority of it is felt 1000 years after their death, then <i>still</i> it is better to have them sooner rather than later. For that means waiting 1000 years for the next step in our civilization rather than 2000 years.<p>> Darwinism requires diversity. Hence it is simply better to invest in disadvantaged<p>Why not invest in <i>diverse</i> but advantaged then? How is it that you jump from one proposition to the other (i.e. that diversity equals disadvantaged)?<p>> the truth is that you are coming from a position of an individual with significant wealth who is looking for next Aristotle to increase his personal wealth by taking his<p>No. We both agree that the next Aristotle probably wouldn&#x27;t be the next billionaire. He will probably not be a poor man, but it is highly unlikely that he will turn my fifty billion into fifty trillion.<p>> All the arguments are simply dressings to make that short-sightedness and greed look good.<p>There!

So a clever programmer will always be able to boost performance more than a compiler.<p>Being NP-complete doesn&#x27;t really have anything to do with whether humans can solve a given problem better than computers or not. It just means that it (probably) takes exponential time to solve.<p>I believe there is no distinction whatsoever, in principle, between computers and humans (our brains are just big, complicated calculators). As such, it&#x27;s only a matter of time before computers beat humans in compilation at every point, just like the situation in chess. People claimed for years that humans will always have some edge in chess, because they &quot;understand&quot; the game, or have &quot;ingenuity&quot;, or something like that. Nobody claims that anymore, since computers absolutely massacre humans. And similarly to chess, computers have been getting better and better at a very fast rate, while humans have stagnated more-or-less.<p>As an aside, computer chess got quite boring for me, due to the homogeneity of current programs, but it did help to show me the limitations in current programming languages and compilers.

Smart compilers apply drastic, and sometimes unintuitive transformation to optimize code. To do the same manually and using low levels of abstractions would require a toure de force to pull off correctly. This simply is not going to happen often. Its precisely for speed that we need a high-level, yet optimization friendly, language so that we can delegate the job of optimizing the code to the compiler.

That&#x27;s not bad per se, but it&#x27;s certainly not the way to be innovative on the long term -- do something cool enough to be gobbled up by a bigger fish.",1396598457

This seems impossible -- I can get absurd commercial fire alarm systems, or I can get stuff like Nest which isn&#x27;t really designed for life safety, or I can get the cheapest things from Home Depot.<p>What I really want is someone like Assa Abloy to make a high-end residential/small office product.  Generally I want this for building management, access control, security, life safety, etc.",1396598452

First, few architectures have so many weird traps and interactions as x86 does. Second, most of these things become visible once you start measuring (although you have to be very careful when measuring performance, as it is an art in itself).<p>The x86 these days is effectively a poor-man&#x27;s VLIW machine: you have a number of units with out-of-order execution. This means that you can look at your instruction stream as a stream of VLIW instructions for all of the CPUs units. The performance of your code might depend not just on the exact number of instructions, their execution times, their latencies, but also on the interdependencies between your instructions and scheduling constraints. Getting that right is a nightmare, and even if you do get it right on your chip, there are at least several major x86 architectures in use, each one with its own peculiarities.<p>As a counterexample, I recently wrote some ARM (Thumb-2, for the Cortex-M4) code. It wasn&#x27;t very difficult, and the code I wrote was <i>much</i> better than what gcc could produce.",1396598438

CPUs in, say, 5 years are likely to have alternative and more powerful ways of dealing with certain things, and a good optimizing compiler <i>should</i> (optimistically!) be able to compile older code to run even more quickly on newer CPUs than hand coded assembly might allow.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how much impact this issue has in something like the Linux kernel, say, but I could imagine if significant parts of the kernel were written in i386-level x86, it would be a big issue now and demand much rewriting compared to C. (But I could be wrong as I&#x27;m not a kernel hacker, and would appreciate expert insight here ;-))",1396598417
