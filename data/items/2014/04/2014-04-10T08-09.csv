7564924,comment,7561522,7563619,2,0,TeMPOraL,,,"I strongly disagree with your point 2). The reality is, if Comodo is caught issuing phony certificates, there&#x27;s some media shitstorm that never actually changes anything, stocks go up and down a bit, and few days later nobody ever remembers any it or cares about it, and the company continues doing it&#x27;s business as usual (don&#x27;t believe me? then why GoDaddy still exists?). On the other hand, we have social mechanisms for dealing with mistrust in place since forever. If you are caught untrustworthy once about something, you&#x27;ll probably never be trusted again on that issue. People know how to deal with those situations effectively between themselves. It&#x27;s also easier to boycott an untrustworthy peer than a multinational corporation. You have many friends to choose from, but there is usually no other company to go to for a comparable service.",1397120382

They protect large companies against the vagaries of DNS hacks, expired domain registrations, typosquatting, etc.<p>E.g. a (long) while ago Microsoft failed to renew hotmail.co.uk, just like they previously forgot to renew passport.com.

7564905,comment,7564680,7564680,29,0,kijin,,,"Although Gandi.net is a fantastic company, their security practices are nothing to write home about.<p>A few years ago, one of my clients lost access to her Gandi.net account. Unfortunately, she had the &quot;disable password resets via email&quot; option set in her account. That should have given her quite a headache, right?<p>Nope. I, an independent contractor who didn&#x27;t even own the account, was able to convince Gandi support to disable that option so that she could reset her password via email. They didn&#x27;t even ask for any documents to prove either my identity or my client&#x27;s. It took several days, but the only reason it took so long was because their English support was very slow back then.<p>So I&#x27;m not surprised that Gandi let the attacker change the email on FastMail&#x27;s account when presented with genuine-looking documents.<p>And this is not a problem that is specific to Gandi. Even with other online services, it&#x27;s often quite easy to bypass automated security measures if you go through a human being, whether through the support system or through good ol&#x27; snail mail. In fact, I&#x27;m sure that snail mail is by far the most reliable way to take over someone else&#x27;s account nowadays. So many of us in the tech industry have no idea how to verify the authenticity of a piece of paper, especially if it&#x27;s from a different country.<p>Meanwhile, another favorite web host and registrar of mine, NearlyFreeSpeech.net, recently enabled two-factor authentication. But they did it differently. In addition to OATH TOTP, NearlyFreeSpeech allows you to select several other tests that you need to pass in order to recover your account. If you tell them to give you six different tests, which will probably take several weeks because some of the tests involve snail mail, they&#x27;ll honor your preferences. Or you can choose to take four tests. Or three. Or two. It&#x27;s your choice. That&#x27;s multi-factor auth done right.",1397119952

But you can&#x27;t simultaneously moan about how unfair the world is when you make that choice and then can&#x27;t find as much work using Y. You knew what the situation was ahead of time.<p>This is the fundamental difference between being a worker selling hours and a company producing a product.  I care a lot more about how much I get paid when I work than how many of my hours I can sell.  From my perspective?  it is far better to be employed 50% of the time at $100/hr than 100% of the time at $50/hr.    Hell, I&#x27;d rather be employed 20% of the time at $100/hr than 100% of the time at $50/hr.   I can use those other hours to work on setting up my company so that it can sell more products with less labor.  Or read a book or go on vacation or something.   Optimizing for getting more work is for people at the very beginning of their career, or for people who can&#x27;t earn a high enough hourly wage to cover the essentials on less than full-time work.<p>The thing is, demand does not equal pay;  there are more jobs managing windows computers than there are managing Linux computers, but generally speaking? the latter pays better, in part because you usually have more servers per admin in a linux environment.   Personally, I vastly prefer a high-pay, low-demand job where I might spend some time unemployed over the opposite.<p>(that said, I don&#x27;t know what .net dev pay looks like compared to node.js pay.

That is why I would propose a layout system that is based on positioning guides (straight or curved guide lines or shapes) rather than a box model. It would work like this: Given a set of initial guides which describe the screen shape one can define new guides which depend on the position of other guides. To define a vertical line at the center of the screen one would write: (defgd my-guide (between screen.left screen.right) (h-pos 50%)). Then one could place an object at a position along that line: (defobj my-object (anchor center) (guide my-guide) (pos (/ (- screen.bottom screen.top) 2)) (content &quot;Hello&quot; (class bold &quot;World!&quot;)) (class headline1) (wrap-at screen.left screen.right) (padding 10px)). Instead of spelling out a content string one could, of course, refer to a variable which is stored in a separate resource.

Something below I wrote on reddit about this technique:<p>Due to the pulse length (10ms) there is an inherent 100Hz bandwidth in the signal, which is equivalent to the frequency shift you would expect if moving at 4m/s. In other words, Doppler measurements of a single pulse is NOT going to be useful in attempting to localise.<p>However, because the pinger has a relatively stable repetition rate (about 1.106s from what I could see) you can do a cool trick to localise it (assuming the source is stationary):<p>- Perform a pass over the area of interest (ie where the pinger is)\n- measure the ping times of arrival (either manually with waveform inspection or write an envelope detector)\n- plot the ping times of arrival versus the time of arrival modulo ping interval. ie in MATLAB: plot(toa, mod(toa, 1.106), &#x27;.&#x27;);\n- The plot indicates the relative distance from the source / receiver. Hopefully the plot should contain a local minimum representing a closest point of approach (ie like <a href=""http://imgur.com/v1ZclaX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/v1ZclaX</a> ). This means that the source lies in a line perpendicular to the vessels course centred at the location of the receiver (ie TPL-25) at CPA time\n- Perform another pass over the area of interest on a course perpendicular to the first\n- measure the ping times of arrival and look for CPA as before\n- You should now have two intersecting lines. Guess what should be at the intersection? :)<p>This relies on having a stable ping repetition rate.<p>BTW this is the author of the linked post here :)<p>Rodney<p>Edit: @ISL has hit the nail on the head there.

The former doesn&#x27;t scale with time. Something has to give eventually.<p>I&#x27;m a little confused at how he praises Angular and React while simultaneously complaining about the addition of complexity in HTML and CSS to support misgivings. That&#x27;s a good description of what both of those libraries are currently doing.<p>I can understand looking on component-oriented development or intelligent data binding here as &quot;better&quot; if the entire underlying system is totally replaced by these. Unfortunately you can&#x27;t get away from the complexity below them even in the simplest of real world applications, nor should you (a fact Angular sort of embraces, except that you shouldn&#x27;t be modifying the DOM). It exists and is therefore relevant if need to do things in the browser. The ultimate outcome of total DOM abstraction is something like ExtJS which is just fundamentally broken and unusable. Something is broken when the thing that was supposed to make you productive constructs walls for your protection that you must break through or work around just to do basic things.<p>I&#x27;m curious in general about the author&#x27;s interest in Angular. It&#x27;s become so much more complex than that little library Miško was showing off way back before it became big.

Another critical thing will be to find the combination of things that are non-intrusive enough that a company would feel comfortable sharing.

7564764,comment,7561289,7561289,11,0,kijin,,,"I&#x27;ve been wondering about this since they first started beta testing the hourly billing option. Here are my questions:<p>1) Would hourly billing attract a different kind of usage pattern than what Linodes have so far been used for?<p>2) Will this hurt performance for other customers?<p>The reason I&#x27;m curious about this is that even the cheapest Linode comes with a lot of CPU power, especially compared to EC2. But the CPU is not dedicated, in fact it&#x27;s massively oversold. This is great for people who occasionally need to use 8 cores but stay relatively idle most of the time. Guess what, if you keep a server online for months, it&#x27;s going to be idle a lof of the time.<p>Hourly billing, on the other hand, encourages people to fire up an instance, compute whatever they need to compute as quickly as possible, and shut down the instance as soon as they&#x27;re done. In fact, that&#x27;s exactly how I use EC2&#x27;s high-CPU instances. Everything is scripted to ensure the most efficient use of resources throughout the lifetime of the instance, because every hour costs money. Why use 50% CPU for two hours when you can use 100% CPU for one hour for half the cost?<p>This kind of usage pattern, if widespread among customers, can lead to higher overall CPU usage on the host node (as well as of other scarce resources such as I/O), because fewer instances will sit idle. With EC2 this is not a problem AFAIK because the CPUs are dedicated to my instance. But Linode&#x27;s CPUs are shared.<p>For a &quot;traditional&quot; Linode customer, the implication is that there will be busier neighbors. Officially, of course, you would never get less resources than a fair share of the host node. But it has usually been the case that, in Linode, you get a lot more resources most of the time. If people can no longer rely on this unofficial assumption, there could be trouble ahead for Linode.",1397117009
