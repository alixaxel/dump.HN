7571694,comment,7571327,7571327,13,0,numair,,,"This doesn&#x27;t quite make sense to me. Or, it makes sense, but not for the reasons presented on the surface.<p>If you&#x27;re Andreesen Horowitz, you have access to a nearly-unlimited supply of capital. You also have incredible access to information and dealflow throughout the industry. In situations in which you are not capital constrained, the most efficient way to establish a workforce is to acquire it from somewhere else; that&#x27;s why acqui-hires make so much sense, because you&#x27;ve basically had someone else do the hard (and often completely unpredictable) work of figuring out if people can work together in a successful manner (which, I should note, is different from determination of whether the thing they&#x27;re working on is successful). If I were A16Z, I would arbitrage my information advantage to secure a high quality engineering team by acquiring a company that had smart people but a lame product; going through a traditional hiring process would be a waste of my time (and since everyone is throwing money at my firm, it would also be a waste of time that could be better spent on figuring out where to deploy my capital).<p>A16Z is rich enough to buy people, if it really wants people, for internal use (whether it is for their own company needs, or for some idea that they want to incubate inside of the firm). And even if they don&#x27;t want to buy a whole set of people, they have enough wisdom and experience to know that you want to hire within a cohort of successful people rather than randoms (to see this in practice, take a look at Don Melton&#x27;s post about Eazel alumni ending up at Apple on the front page right now). This tells me that their programming test has more to do with some sort of evaluation of this Hacker Rank service (&quot;tell you what, we will run our own test on the service to see what happens!&quot;) or some other sort of analytical adventure.<p>Or, you know, maybe it is really a programming test after all. Maybe they are hoping to find some sort of diamond-in-the-rough engineers who are socially and career-wise disconnected from an existing network. Some sort of &quot;black swan programmer&quot; or something. But I highly doubt it.<p>So basically, if you go through this test, you&#x27;re helping A16Z evaluate something; that something, however, probably isn&#x27;t you.",1397203007

Anyone with a modicum of soldering experience should be able to tackle the job with the right technique and a little practice.<p>The preferred approach is simply to use a wide chisel tip soldering iron and plenty of flux to make all the joints in one pass, and if necessary clean up the area with desoldering wick. That&#x27;s the traditional method for soldering fine-pitch SMD ICs and works remarkably well, as it relies on the wetting behaviour of the solder rather than any particular dexterity or skill. The solder won&#x27;t wet to the body of the package, only to the pads, so any bridges between the pads will naturally be drawn away by capillary action. As long as the wires are neatly tinned it should all go quite smoothly. A search for &quot;drag soldering&quot; should yield lots more information, including a number of demonstrations on YouTube.<p>If necessary, a basic jig to hold the part and wires could be easily constructed using a small piece of dense hardwood and a scalpel.

7571631,comment,7571385,7571507,7,0,kilburn,,,"If you are speaking about <i>execution</i> speed, you got the idea wrong. From a quote in the article:<p>> If you use the high level typing stuff coding is a lot more work and requires more thinking, [...] (but) you can even hope for <i>better</i> performance than C by elision of run time checks otherwise considered mandatory, due to proof of correctness from the type system. Expect over 50% of your code to be such proofs in critical software and probably 90% of your brain power to go into constructing them rather than just implementing the algorithm. It&#x27;s a paradigm shift.<p>The idea is to formally prove that the code is not doing unexpected things. The process is relatively simple to understand:<p>First you define the assumptions you make about the program, its execution environment, and the acceptable/expected results of your program. This is known as &quot;formal specification&quot; of the program. It is a critical part. If your specification is wrong, then the whole approach breaks down. However, this part should be <i>much</i> smaller than your whole codebase, and hence you can be extra careful on it.<p>Next, using this specification, you write proofs showing that the code <i>can not</i> do anything unintended (such as accessing a buffer out of its valid range). The compiler goes through this proofs and checks that everything is provably correct (according to the specification). Then it can generate code without runtime checks that you would otherwise probably implement, because it is <i>sure</i> that certain things cannot happen. As a result, the code may end up being actually faster.<p>Although a bit involved, the idea should be pretty intuitive. It is exactly what you are doing in your mind when programming. The main differences are:<p>1. We humans are pretty comfortable working with inexact and/or incomplete specifications. Then some undefined behavior happens, and our programs bug out. For instance, it is very easy for us to think about the division operator as something that always yields a value, ignoring the &quot;division by zero&quot; edge case. Computers are not, and force you to specify what exactly should happen when you encounter such edge cases.<p>2. We are also pretty bad at exhaustively checking every possibility, whereas computers excel at it. With the help of human-written proofs, obviously (otherwise verifying a program would involve checking every possible input for it, which is obviously intractable).<p>TL;DR: The tradeoff here is between <i>development</i> and <i>compilation</i> speed versus <i>correctness</i>, which implies improved security <i>and</i> execution speed.",1397201526

7571620,comment,7571223,7571223,53,0,bane,,,"This was really a crazy time, fresh off of a landslide Reagan victory and no doubt the moral hysteria boosted by it, I remember this situation really well.<p>My parents (mostly my mother) are very religious and I remember being driven around town with the local Christian radio station on and it being just wall-to-wall fear mongering about Satanism, backmasking in rock songs and D&D. Just endless talk, hour after hour, about how all this will lead your child to drugs, pornography, satanism and suicide -- numerous &quot;concrete&quot; examples were included as the local Christian &quot;research team&quot; swept the country (pre-internet! so most of it was probably just invented whole-cloth) for police reports and court records for Satanic rituals, Rock music and D&D. All reported with deep urgency and absolute truthful authority between gentle praise songs I heard in church every Sunday. Of course they&#x27;d never play a couple seconds of Led Zeppelin back and forth so you could hear the hidden messages revealed, lest you want to kill yourself during the next commercial break or continuous praise song power hour.<p>Terse descriptions of D&D were provided. &quot;A game where players assume the roles of various characters, demons are involved, sometimes, like <i>gambling</i>, dice are used!&quot; without any cultural context about how it&#x27;s exactly like any other game where people assume different identities, like Cowboys & Indians, or super space spy or whatever.<p>It was a perfect storm of cultural events simultaneously pumped up by various social moralists who, like most groups like this, take tiny kernels of truth and wrap them in heaping piles of agendas, fabrications and outright lies and blanket every form of sensory input to drive the masses into full foaming at the mouth hysteria.<p>The publicity eventually leaked out into regular media and I remember seeing some of these &quot;issues&quot; (which had all been masterfully woven together into a single moral crisis by the religious media my mother listened to) break into the regular nightly news my father forced me to sit and watch every evening (to build culture and character).<p>My mother was absolutely obsessed with all this and was driven to hysteria. One time pulling the car over to the side of a busy highway and making me promise, <i>promise</i>, I&#x27;d never roll D&D dice and risk letting Satan into my heart - tears streaming down her face while she shook like a leaf -- because I might commit suicide when the game is over. She&#x27;d listen to hour after hour of pronouncements of how the country was going to sin...I&#x27;d watch her cleaning the kitchen while this played on the radio, her scrubbing getting more and more vigorous as her emotions became more and more upset.<p>Even at the tender age of...6 or 7, I knew the entire thing was a ridiculous pile of malarkey. I honestly had no clue what D&D was, had only heard rock music in passing (my music selection was pretty heavily regulated) and certainly wasn&#x27;t involved in Satanism of any kind. I was more concerned with the severe mental instability this seemed to be drawing out in my mother...who seemed to be the only person I knew who couldn&#x27;t separate fantasy from reality in this situation.<p>When the D&D cartoon started airing, curious, I&#x27;d sneak a few minutes of it in, titillated that something so dangerous was in cartoon form and on television before bed time. The show was pretty tame so I usually got bored and turned it off and did something else with my time. (He-Man was also banned in my house).<p>I vaguely remember the acronym BADD from those times and the name Patricia Pulling, and the claim that players would get so wrapped up in the fantasy of their characters, with reality and imagination so tangled up, that when your character died, there was some non-trivial chance you would go out and kill yourself, with probably a recently listened to Led Zeppelin tape in the boom box and with some kind of Satanic connection, or sacrificed chickens or something nearby.<p>And suddenly, one day, the Christian &quot;news&quot; sources my mother listened to moved on to something else and it was all over. Rock music was still around, Led Zeppelin was still for sale, D&D was still a game, but apparently the moral crusaders had stopped <i>something</i> and had moved on to something else. I think this was when all the major lawsuits had concluded with BADD losing all of them.<p>It was still on my banned list, but the hysteria was over. Like most kids I just ignored it and played a little D&D over at my friends&#x27; houses till I got bored of it and listened to rock music just the same. Years later, remembering the hysteria, a friend and I figured out how to reverse a cassette tape and we experimented listening for hidden messages in Rock Music cassettes to little success.<p>The early 1980s were a really weird moment in American history.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothered_About_Dungeons_and_Dragons"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bothered_About_Dungeons_and_Dr...</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backmasking"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backmasking</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8Rop4Zt-S0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8Rop4Zt-S0</a>",1397201301

7571573,comment,7571444,7571444,1,0,kijin,,,"I agree that basic income can and should replace a large number of incredibly inefficient welfare programs that we currently have. This, along with the fact that a lot of regulations that are meant to protect workers will become rather unnecessary -- who cares about unions when you can afford to quit? -- is probably what gives basic income a curiously bipartisan appeal. The left can support it because it&#x27;s welfare on steroids. The right can support it because (they think) it will lead to fewer regulations.<p>But I couldn&#x27;t care less about the romanticized ideal of civic culture that this dude pretends existed in America before the welfare state appeared. Especially since his version of civil culture involves neighborhood groups taking charge of nearly everything the government used to do. After all, the government cut them a check. Why can&#x27;t they just put out their own fires in their spare time?<p>And why does he think it&#x27;s okay to deny basic income to everyone under 21, just to make sure that the policy does not influence people&#x27;s reproductive choices? His far-right libertarian ideology of &quot;minimize the government at all costs&quot; seeps into and not-so-subtly distorts his vision of basic income. Reduction of government size, if any, should be a side effect of basic income, not its very purpose.",1397199933
