I&#x27;m saying that because you want them to take on much of the risk of being a consultant you should pay them accordingly. Anything less is shifting the majority of the risk to the employee which is IMO incredibly immoral.<p>At least with a 1-2 week trial it is possible to keep your existing job which greatly reduces the risk.",1397195925

7571363,comment,7568675,7571134,3,0,munificent,,,"> Did you work on Madden at EA (since you mention it in the intro)?<p>I did, though I didn&#x27;t really touch gameplay. I was a UI programmer on Madden PC 2002 (Oh God that&#x27;s over a decade ago now, what happened to time?) and I worked on the first version of Madden for the X360 doing mostly animation and tool pipeline stuff.<p>I&#x27;m not the best person to ask about it, but the part that blows my mind is that the &quot;AI&quot; for the game is <i>deeply</i> tied into the animation system. Madden has hundreds (thousands?) of individual player animations: runs, tackling, blocking, catching, you name it. The AI works roughly by searching for an animation that lines up with what it wants to do.<p>For example, if the ball is coming towards a receiver, it looks for a catch animation that will put his arms in about the right place and that stitches together well with the animation he&#x27;s currently playing. If it finds one, then it transitions to that animation and makes the catch.<p>This means the producers who are building and tuning the gameplay do much of it by tweaking animation: changing timing, deciding to add more animations of certain types, etc.<p>As far as I know there is no holistic set of data or code that says, &quot;this is the AI of Madden&quot;. Instead, it&#x27;s just the sum of all of these animations.",1397194152
