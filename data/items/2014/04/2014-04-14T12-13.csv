In my experience, it&#x27;s almost always a complete waste of time adding overhead that&#x27;s never recouped. It works best when you&#x27;re producing X widgets where X is at least 10.

In fact, in Haskell and ML you would be better off leaving out the declarations altogether; the compiler would spot that you&#x27;ve used &quot;fabs&quot;, so it will infer &quot;float<positive>&quot;, and unify this with the &quot;float<positive>&quot; argument of &quot;sqrt&quot;.

But tools for people with domain knowledge to do a little bit of programming were hugely successful. Visual Basic (pre .NET) is the best example. Click together a GUI, add a bit of Databinding, and write some business logic in BASIC. Spreadsheets are another, and they are a gateway drug to VBA. To a lesser extent the .NET ecosystem with XAML and so on falls into this category, too.<p>Another example was Flash. Artists could make little videos with the vector graphics tools (which are still pretty unique in how you can &quot;paint&quot; vector graphics). You could then animate them and make little movies, and add simple interactive features. Then you could add some ActionScript (~Javascript) to get more complex behavior and make litte games.<p>I&#x27;d say this kind of programming-language-light was <i>hugely</i> successful.

Millions of small businesses used MS products and small programs to generate reports, form letters, and so on.

Maybe because people realized that it can cause huge maintenance headaches. Maybe because there is more supply of &quot;proper&quot; developers now.

Idris implements (amongst other things) dependent functions and dependent records.<p>Idris doesn&#x27;t need to support (non-dependent) functions or parametric polymorphism, since they&#x27;re just special-cases of dependent functions. Likewise, typeclasses are just special-cases of dependent records.<p>When we consider Haskell extensions, many of them are designed to introduce dependently-typed idioms (eg. DataKinds). This makes Idris automatically simpler, since it supports those idioms directly and doesn&#x27;t have to offer all of the non-dependent parts of Haskell.<p>On the other hand, typical Haskell programs may <i>use</i> types in a simpler way than typical Idris programs, but that&#x27;s a separate point.

By default, there is no need for an attacker to find a local exploit to get root--the user account has unrestricted password-less sudo authorization.  This is one of the things I disagree with the developers about.<p>2. SELinux is disabled in AppVMs by default.<p>3. The GUI virtualization architecture takes this into account, and uses Xen shared memory to blindly copy a framebuffer prepared by the domU X server.  Exploiting the dom0 X server should be very difficult.<p>Also, one main attractive feature of Qubes is the networking architecture: so long as iptables is not compromised by an attack, and there is no Xen sandbox breakout, it&#x27;s fairly easy to set very restrictive or specific firewall and routing rules which will thwart many zero-day threats.<p>Further, VMs externally look no different than any other Fedora 18/20 installation, so even if an attacker had a Xen sandbox exploit, they would have to have specific knowledge that you run Qubes (e.g. you posted to Hacker News saying so ;)) in order to own your system, which is security &#x27;by obscurity&#x27; but is still useful.<p>Qubes is more of a powerful security-enabling tool than a &#x27;secure by default&#x27; distribution.
