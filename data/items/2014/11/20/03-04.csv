Yes, Uber are not the only company out there with troves of data that is most likely being abused without anyone noticing, but it is just unfortunate that the spotlight is currently on Uber because of the silly words from a man in a position who should know better than to say such stupid things in public (on or off the record, it doesn&#x27;t matter). He worked as an advisor to the White House, he should know the importance of holding your tongue.<p>Not to mention all of the lobbyist pressure Uber is experiencing on the business side of things, this is the kind of stuff taxi driver unions and companies/entities threatened by Uber&#x27;s business model can only dream of getting. They are not doing themselves any favours here.<p>It seems that Uber have well and truly put their foot in it this time over any of the other controversies and scandals that have involved the company. And yet, after all of this, Emil Michael gets to keep his job? Seems to me the only way Uber can start to make amends and repair their broken image here is to make some effort and fire Emil.",1416455908

What happens here is that Google tried to do a &quot;best-effort&quot; service for Chinese users, with the assumption that partial service would be much better than no service (and certainly WAY better than what Chinese users get from their own web companies like Baidu, that not only enforce censorship but also report &quot;bad users&quot; to the government, actively help to spy on dissidents etc.--something Google never considered doing). The search UI would notify users that some results were excluded due to government-enforced restriction, which was at least transparent--and not unlike what Google has to do today in the EU with the &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; censorship. But this wasn&#x27;t good enough for the PRC, their firewall would impose harsh punishment to users who tried to browse forbidden things; I don&#x27;t remember details now but it was like: you try to search for certain words, you&#x27;d be cut off the internet and not only your IP but other people too. So in a later attempt, Google search tried to warn users in advance, with a customized Google Instant so the user could avoid submitting a &quot;bad&quot; query that could result in blocking. This idea didn&#x27;t work because the firewall was quickly updated to crack down on it, and I think that was the last attempt, then Google desisted to fight this battle because any progress would clearly require too much compromising, more than could be justified by an attempt to provide a pragmatic, partial service.<p>[Disclaimer: Googler, but not especially intimate with the events above; none of this is internal info either, it&#x27;s all widely reported stuff.]",1416453458

I prefer using a series of assertions to simply returning true or false because often times you want to put multiple assertions in the same test.<p>However the unit test case alone is a pretty valid one. I am all for making it a compiler flag (opt-in or opt-out).

I don&#x27;t think that follows logically and in my experience empirically. For the programmers I have introduced to Scala, or that I have talked to who use it none of them have gotten caught up by procedure syntax. This includes traders taking the Scala course that have never programmed before in their life.<p>The color/formatting is a good idea, that should just be done already.
