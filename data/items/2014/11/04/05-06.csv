As long as it&#x27;s not just a &quot;higher&quot; offer, going with the company you really think is better for you (both financially and technically), is always the right move. Even if you accepted the offer, it&#x27;s OK to rescind, like Steve said above, just be honest and direct, yes it&#x27;s awkward, but it&#x27;s definitely more awkward for you than the company that made you the offer.

To put it plainly, they allow you to shove more fuel into the same size engine. To burn more fuel you need a lot more air, hence the compressor.  The same engine produces more power by burning more fuel per unit time.<p>As far as the 10% fuel economy improvement (i.e: 20 to 22 mpg) by combining cylinder shutdown with electric turbo is concerned, well, I&#x27;ll give them the benefit of the doubt and remain very skeptical.<p>Do any of the claims account for non-trivial compressor motor power?<p>If we dig deep enough are we going to learn that this company got a huge grant from the EPA?

8555284,comment,8554996,8555243,0,0,amluto,,,"> It appears that the current quantum mechanical view of the world is simply an acknowledgement of this complexity and the associated unknowns. While it presents a statistical &quot;model&quot; that works for our purposes, it must be acknowledged as a model and not confused with reality. The push for figuring out what drives the statistics needs to continue beyond the building of a model.<p>This is not a accurate representation of quantum mechanics.<p>If you were to write down a classical description of the state of all the particles in a piece of paper and the state of all the particles that they might interact with over the course of a few seconds, and you solved the equations for what happens, you would get an <i>exact</i> description of the result.  This description would be wrong if you look closely enough because classical mechanism doesn&#x27;t correctly describe the universe we live in.<p>If you did the same thing with a quantum description of the initial state of the paper, you would also get an <i>exact</i> description of the result.  That description would be very strange -- if try to deduce what you would see if you looked at the piece of paper (remember, you&#x27;re just a bunch more particles interacting with that paper), you learn the bizarre answer that you would seem to have some chance of seeing the paper in one configuration and some chance of seeing the paper in a different configuration.<p>But there&#x27;s no respect in which quantum mechanics is an acknowledgement of some kind of complexity that is beyond our computational ability to describe exactly.  To the contrary, quantum mechanics <i>is</i> our attempt to describe things exactly, and it works amazingly well.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that a full quantum description of all but the smallest systems is far beyond our ability to compute directly.  That&#x27;s when we switch to statistical mechanics or similar techniques to try to deal with the complexity in a manageable way.<p>To the pedants: if you&#x27;re trying to model a piece of paper with quantum mechanics, then you&#x27;ll have to approximate the very small-scale high-energy bits, because we don&#x27;t know the laws of physics at those scales.  But there is so far no compelling reason to believe that those laws will not fit perfectly in the framework of quantum mechanics once we figure them out.",1415079535

Somehow, even though superposition is observed and observable, even though the scale on which we can observe it is climbing steadily larger, people keep assuming that it either dissipates sometime before our scale, or that it&#x27;s an illusion produced by some sort of semi-classical, overcomplicated reinterpretation.<p>The original idea—that the wave function is the whole deal—works just fine if you accept that <i>we</i> can be in superposition too. If you simply accept that the <i>entire</i> classical concept might be an illusion, and work up from the wave function, there&#x27;s no reason to shoehorn in an idea like Collapse or Pilot-Wave.<p>Yes, Copenhagen is wrong. Yes, Collapse is patently absurd. Yes, assuming that there is exactly one, stochastic, probabilistic reality makes no sense.
