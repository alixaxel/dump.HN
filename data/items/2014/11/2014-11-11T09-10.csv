But your arguments just become troll fodder when they start the way you&#x27;ve started your argument.</i><p>Not sure what&#x27;s trollish about it. There are lots of instances of police reporting BS assaults just in order to arrest someone. People have spoken about such experiences in HN too. Not to mention the recent thing in Fergusson, were the same kind of incident happened twice in the span of a month.<p>I&#x27;m not in favor of &quot;proving&quot; things with numbers outside of hard sciences. In real life numbers are dirty themselves, tailored, manipulated etc. Either you know about some things from experience and/or can draw conclusions from the limited input that you read and learn about or not. Statistics ain&#x27;t the answer, official statistics even less so.<p>><i>And you&#x27;ve only simulated the appearance of rationality by bringing German police shootings into the matter, something almost completely non-sequitur and demonstrating your lack of rational thought on the issue.</i><p>Not sure how it&#x27;s non sequitur in any way. It was an argument that police forces can and DO operate differently in a modern, advanced, western country.<p>If you want to argue that the US is not as advanced and civilized and as such it&#x27;s more dangerous for policemen, I might agree, but that&#x27;s another point. And it might be one caused by the way the police/justice/prison system itself works here too.",1415699860

The inefficiency of government benefits and subsidies inflates the cost of health care on one hand, while inability for policies to customise benefits per patient means often benefits are distributed unfairly.<p>Where in a communist nation the government reduces inequality by making everyone poor, a nation that taxes heavily to provide universal benefits reduces inequality (of family connections) by making everyone face their problems alone, with only the help of a regular bank deposit from the government as well as the occasional union with a family member. It divides us from a strong network with many connections between each node to one of spoke and hub, where the spoke is an individual and the hub the state.<p>Sometimes you might feel lonely and have no one to turn to, even as you have dozens and dozens of friends.

Windows laptops are a bundle of compromises that doesn&#x27;t serve the average home user all that well. Chromebooks are an appealing concept.<p>OTOH, the praise of chromebooks since the start always seems to be &quot;these are cool, they would be great for X&quot; where X is your theoretical aunt, nephew or neighbor. Enthusiasts also like them as a &quot;2nd machine.&quot; At the same time, while they continue to sell well I see very little of Chrome OS traffic in web analytics. When the iphone first went on sale, the traffic ramped up immediately. Android web traffic lagged behind sales a lot more and the build up took longer, but it was still obvious. Public data seems to be generally similar.<p>I don&#x27;t know how far to take conclusions from that. I realize that certain sites do experience significant Chrome OS traffic, especially US education focuses sites. But, for most of the web, Chrome OS seems to be fighting to get to the middle of the &quot;other&quot; category, with SymbianOS and Playstation as rivals.<p>I think Chrome OS is awesome, but still not done. Some sort of a merger with android, some rejigging of the apps and the basic metaphors might be an improvement.

If they aren&#x27;t directly creating value for someone, then their efforts are probably best directed elsewhere. There is value to yourself for learning and scratching your own itch, but that effort needs to be treated like a side project. It doesn&#x27;t cross over into your real work.<p>Docker is low level plumbing on which more &quot;user friendly&quot; workflows are being built. These workflows are what developers should be using. Docker is still young, so there is still a lot more attention on the plumbing than there is in any tools which have been built on top of it. That will change as the ecosystem develops.<p>But this is a common developer problem. Sometimes developers will spend time doing anything other than what they need to be doing to actually ship things.

I disagree that his writing is brilliant stylistically, it&#x27;s interesting and playful, but often pretty lacklustre in terms of craft (plot, character development, language). The ideas he likes to explore I find intriguing however.<p>It <i>is</i> true that Banks never really explored how Culture society would function, or really how a post-scarcity model would work - all that is just assumed to exist and function well in the books, however I think he was more interested in exploring the accommodation of humans to intelligent machines, the questions raised by extremely powerful and developed civilisations clashing with civilisations which are not as developed, the contradiction of an ostensibly peace-loving yet heavily militarised culture, and the implications of transcending normal human life. These are questions we will have to address at some point even in our narrow world (we haven&#x27;t yet), and I find it interesting to read his take on them.<p>So I think while you&#x27;re right in some sense that the Culture is implausible (or at least not made plausible), the focus is not on the Culture simply because it&#x27;s a backdrop, and gets him to the place where he can talk about these interesting questions.",1415698625

If a consumer dies before committing an offset but after reading data from the broker, a fresh consumer that joins the consumer group can see the same data once the system determines the original has died; that ensures all data will be processed, even in the event of consumer failures.<p>Kinesis provides the same ordering guarantees.

With HW - BYOD and that latest every second year student now has her own computer(s)has most likely helped a few of the universities to stay more easily afloat. Microsoft at the same time has managed to win over more than 60% of all universities in the UK (to use Office 365).<p>One reason for that might also be that those universities that tried to provide Google Apps 1-2 years ago to their students mostly had rather negative experiences & many issues with the &quot;roll-outs&quot;. But an even more important reason is the continuous dominance of MS Office in the business world - full proficiency with MS Office does still sound much better on a CV than having used Google Apps for 4 years.<p>This is now intensifying with Microsoft providing MS Office for free directly to all students (including K12) latest from next month on. They have last week started to give free access to their mobile (iPad, Android - tablet solution soon arriving) versions and those are now leading the download charts of all app stores. BTW - real world stats show that about 2/3 students use MS Office on at least 2 devices (laptop plus 1-3 mobile).<p>And the battle for the education infrastructures (storage space, business compute, thin clients - higher edu is one key client for that market) is also intensifying with MS now getting more aggressive with their virtualised desktop solution offerings (see also IE as a service).<p>If Google wants to regain some ground here it needs to provide more turn-key solutions in the infrastructure area. With day-to-day web based and virtualised application infrastructure, the OS becomes more and more secondary for typical end users (HPC / scientific computing / design & engineering are completely different ballgames and dominated by Apple machines on one side and linux / unix clusters for the other use cases).<p>When most mass use and productivity apps can be delivered to almost every machine including Chromebooks in those ways, the end user OS has fully become a commodity and decisions are / can be made mainly by the price / cost only. At that point Chromebooks (together e.g. with NUCs today, US$100 sticks to plug into monitors running Win8/10 / ChromeOS tomorrow) might become the cheapest option with all the consequences for the manufacturers (small margins, scale needed, etc).",1415697437

This is achieved by assigning the partitions in the topic to the consumers in the consumer group so that each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer in the group. By doing this we ensure that the consumer is the only reader of that partition and consumes the data in order. Since there are many partitions this still balances the load over many consumer instances. Note however that there cannot be more consumer instances than partitions.<p><a href=""http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html</a>",1415697214

8588983,comment,8588118,8588895,0,0,vidarh,,,"> What the OP was saying is that spending all that time to make docker work was a bit pointless. Especially as a VM makes no real difference to the end user at this stage.<p>I disagree. Given that you operate a 25k CPU render farm, perhaps you are no longer aware of how poorly devops tends to be managed in small shops. I&#x27;d argue Docker buys you <i>more</i> in those small environments, because in large environments you can build tools that works for your environment. In small environment, the traditional &quot;solution&quot; has been to brush these concerns under the carpet.<p>Just getting repeatable builds of an environment so that you can ensure the dev, test, staging and live environments continue to bear a resemblance to each other is a massive improvement for many of this type of setups. That is, assuming that there <i>are</i> separate dev, test, staging and live environments - often you&#x27;ll find all of it on a single server. Yes, really.<p>Basically, people that think like OP terrify me, because too often we&#x27;ve taken over operations of applications from people who think like that, to find that the operational cost is staggering. We have one customer, for example, that have over the last few years easily paid several times what it would cost to properly re-engineer their application from scratch in time spent for us on operational issues because they&#x27;ve refused to accept that it&#x27;s necessary. (EDIT: Said customer pays for this time, so on paper it works out well for us; in practice it&#x27;s bad for us as it leads to lots of tension with the customer over all the issues, and we&#x27;d much rather have spent that time making their app better, and help them grow their revenue from it - long term that&#x27;d be far better for our customer relationship). This is a &quot;simple PHP and MySQL&quot; application.<p>VMs aren&#x27;t really a solution by themselves. It&#x27;s not app-level isolation that &quot;makes&quot; Docker. It&#x27;s the entire structure that encourages repeatable builds, a repository, and the light weight nature that encourages breaking things into smaller components. I agree that just Docker as isolation in a multi-tenant system is still scary.<p>I&#x27;m currently working on deploying an application in VMs. With Docker in each VM. The VMs gives us the isolation we need in a multi-tenant system. Docker lets us ensure that dependencies between each component is well documented (or the components won&#x27;t have access...), and that we have a decent image repository, and that we have ways of managing the entire lifecycle of each component. The two are complementary technologies.<p>In a large enough environment you could solve the issues that Docker solves with process. In a small environment that process is usually non-existent or weak.<p>> AUFS<p>AUFS is not necessary. Btrfs or device mapper backends have been supported for a long time. And even then, for any data volums that needs high throughput you&#x27;d use a bind mount from the host.",1415697012

Now what makes this little function so darn useful is it takes anything fulfilling its interfaces (io.Writer and io.Reader).
