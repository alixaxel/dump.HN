My parents have never ever used anything but Google, and don&#x27;t even understand that there are _other_ search engines out there. As such perhaps we should view it as a public utility. Just like the public transit system brings people to real destinations google search brings people to virtual destinations.<p>At the same time this shouldn&#x27;t deprive Google of its revenue. So an approach should be taken which enforces neutrality in search results but also leaves room to serve adds.<p>I think that recent actions from Google are partially to blame for this attention from the European council. There have been warnings thrown Googles way. As it stands I believe Google is even breaking privacy laws with the fusion of Youtube and Google+ behind the scenes. There was also criticism from the Council about google blurring the distinction between adds and real results. So this can&#x27;t come as a surprise to Google.",1417094990
