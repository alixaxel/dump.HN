This is actually a good thing about the electoral college - it decouples the states and tells us what to do when we&#x27;ve got a pile of plurality votes from Wisconsin, instant run off votes from Florida, and range votes from Rhode Island.  Imagine trying to pick a winner from those otherwise!  You&#x27;re still faced with finding a majority of electors, which repeats some of the same issues, but as I understand it could involve conversation - which enables deliberate avoidance of some failure modes.",1415728776

(Those red asterisks next to the numbers correspond to a footnote that is conveniently missing from the page...) A &quot;read latency of 150usec&quot; translates to maximum possible read IOPS rate of 1/150e-6 = 6.67K (with one outstanding I/O). But they quote a &quot;random read IOPS of 140K&quot;. That would only be possible if their DDR3-based DIMM could process 21 concurrent read I/O operations. But to the best of my knowledge, DDR3 is limited to 8 banks/DIMM, so there could not possibly be more than 8 concurrent read I/O at any one time. Far from 21.<p>So SanDisk is likely quoting a <i>worst case</i> read latency and/or a <i>best case</i> read IOPS. Customers are left to themselves to figure out which of these numbers is most likely to represent the average performance...<p>PS: here is a paper with some more details but that still fails to explain this discrepancy: <a href=""http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SanDisk%20ULLtraDIMM_0.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.snia.org/sites/default/files/SanDisk%20ULLtraDIMM...</a>",1415728067

When I started receiving treatment, my life was by the same measures in much worse shape - had just gotten fired from a job for non-performance (due to a total inability to concentrate, as well as the lack of motivation that usually goes with depression), was broke as broke can be, was having a lot of relationship problems and so on. With my neurotransmitters tweaked, I felt better while dealing with very difficult circumstances than I ever did with untreated clinical depression and an otherwise-easy life situation.<p>I am not trying to dismiss the emotional turmoil that people no doubt experience in stressful and uncertain circumstances like starting a business, but I think it&#x27;s important to understand the difference between that emotional state and the sort of irrational utter despair that people suffering from mental illness feel. I think the tools needed to address each problem are likely to differ significantly - no amount of therapy or reading r/GetMotivated (bizarrely linked in the article above) would change the fact that I was experiencing the effects of what was most likely a physical ailment.",1415728062

I do not collect any repositories from Github but rather let the users manually submit a repo to Issue-Bidder. 
And at this point I think there is only one reason why bountysource does the opposite: For marketing reason – or better let&#x27;s say this straight-out: the intention to make money. Guess what, the opensource community (speaking as a set of all specific communities) is a high potential and open market. Everybody is able to move mountains if you&#x27;re ruthless enough. Let&#x27;s just take this post on reddit as an example: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2dsvme/someone_stole_my_gpl_code_from_github_showing_it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2dsvme/someone_stol...</a> and I&#x27;m sure tons of other example cases exist out there.
In my opinion we can compare bountysource and all the other vultures out there with the financial brokers back in the 90&#x27; (why did I even set a filter to the 90&#x27; anyways?).
Should we now all hate them? Or are we now just hating around because we are naive and didn&#x27;t restrict all our repos and do believe in the positive aspects of this high potential market called opensource?",1415727920

I&#x27;m a deductive thinker (which I realize is weird for a programmer), so I find metaphor and allusion to be useful tools for explaining myself.  Mystical language, in particular, is very rich, colourful, and goes hand-in-hand with Lisp culture, since the multi-paradigm nature of the language appeals to deductive thinkers.  Obviously I have studied psychonautics and chaos magick in some depth, and I was particularly taken by the idea from these modern schools of mysticism, that belief is a tool, that can be wielded to consciously control your own mind, much like (but not exactly like) how a programmer controls a computer by writing software.<p>As for my own heavily transhumanist &quot;system&quot; of Neuro-Occultism, it&#x27;s more of a philosophical framework---the basic premise is that all supposedly supernatural phenomena can be explained in terms of psychology, neuroscience, and the physical sciences; that only once you have ruled out the possibility that a supposedly supernatural experience is a purely psychological phenomenon can you begin to model a physical explanation; that the experience of supposedly supernatural phenomena are more interesting and powerful when examined in this light; and that even qualitative systems such as the human mind can be described quantitatively, by adapting research in quantum computer science and biological computation to the field of neuroscience.  It&#x27;s not so different from Cognitive Science, only it emphasizes that once you know that all belief systems are just <i>paradigms</i>, that the human mind can support multiple, simultaneous, even contradictory paradigms, and that your fundamental being is in fact a quantitative system, you can really start to put your brain to work.  The problem lies with the fact that the language of the unconscious mind is purely symbolic and associative; thus, a mystical language is necessitated by the structure of our minds---even though a rigorous, mathematical model would be preferable in terms of the scientific method.  Lisp, metaphorically applied to the model of the mind, brings us most of the way there.<p>The <i>purpose</i> of Neuro-Occultism is to develop such a rigorous, mathematical model of consciousness and being; and in so doing, deprecate itself.  I see this as an essential aspect of the &quot;technological singularity&quot;, both for the realization of emergent machine intelligence, and for the transfer of human consciousness to a computational system---because until such time as the human mind can be understood quantitatively, the singularity will remain science-fiction and fantasy.  But then, even the idea of the singularity is a problem, a fundamental limitation of current consciousness that prevents us from seeing past the event horizon of this convergence of technology, biology, individual and social psychology; in order to both achieve the singularity and transcend it, we need to first transcend our own segmented and qualitative perception of self.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more I&#x27;d like to say on the subject, but that would be a book of its own. Back on topic: I do realize that the heavy-handed mystical tone and Lisp proselytization currently present in the introductory text of LLTHW is useless cruft; I&#x27;m a passionate and excitable person by nature, but I recognize that it is holding back the work and interfering with Zed Shaw&#x27;s methodology.  Writing a book is an iterative process, and my effort has been focused on getting a complete scope in order to pump out solid, relevant exercises---so for the time being, I&#x27;ve simply marked the intro chapters as rejected/need-to-be-rewritten.  I <i>really</i> hope it won&#x27;t take me a few more years to finish this book though!",1415726659

The first several games I let run had unstable dynamics: one side gained an advantage and grew and grew until it took over the whole board, usually in less than a minute. But later, through experimentation, I found that stability is possible.<p>The corners seem to be especially stable. I waited until the game had consolidated to 3 colors, then I created 4 new colors and added them to the corners (I slowed the game down to 500,000 milliseconds so I could have time to paint the corners, then I went back to 30 milliseconds). With 4 corners held weakly by 4 colors, and 3 large colors holding the center, the game is remarkably stable. I watched it, in the background, for several hours. One of the corners disappeared, but the other 3 corners held on. I went off to bed. In the morning, 2 more of the corners had been swallowed, but 1 of them still survived. These 4 surviving colors have been battling now for over 24 hours. The game has reached equilibrium.",1415725751

It was more or less born as American political scientists et all learned about the limits of governmental regulation, regulatory capture, and the limits and downsides of the American system of labor union negotiation and membership, and attempted to find a better alternative.<p>I think the problem, and this is just a personal theory, is that many libertarian ideas need to come in duplets or triplets to be effective.  Take carbon emissions for a quick (and not completely accurate) example.  I&#x27;ve had conversations with libertarians that have argued that carbon emissions should not be fined, capped, traded, or in any way regulated.  Basically, when the people care enough about the environment, they will vote effectively with their dollars.<p>Crazily enough, this could actually work, but it needs help.  Either carbon emissions would have to be valued (so that companies had to pay to emit carbon, most likely via a tax), or all products would be required to state how much carbon was emitted in that item&#x27;s production, as well as educated as to what that meant, so they could make an informed decision.<p>In reality, the first idea will be picked up and heavily trumpeted by the energy industry (no government taxation!), but the follow up ideas will be completely ignored or torpedoed.  As a result, you end up with the type of modern American Libertarianism you describe.  The more this sort of selective trumpeting occurs, the more self-describing libertarians will self-select membership, and the more radical the group may become.<p>That nolan chart is a great example.  When I first saw it, it was and still is a great way of introducing people to various types of political theories.  But the example you linked is horrendous.   The questions underneath the economic freedom section are incredibly misleading, and the result of decades of selective trumpeting.

If I were to publish a software product called Mustang, for example, Ford wouldn&#x27;t be able to sue me for copyright infringement.  My product shares a trademark with one of theirs, but it&#x27;s in a different enough market that the two trademarks don&#x27;t conflict with each other.<p>It sounds like Groupon&#x27;s proposed product is point of sale hardware.  That&#x27;s different enough from a desktop window manager that Groupon can quite possibly get a lawyer to convince a jury that they&#x27;re different businesses.  Therefore GNOME Foundation has to pay a lawyer to stand up and argue the other side of the case.",1415725208

He&#x27;s just been on a crusade lately to eradicate unwanted VCSs still used in older projects, including CVS for NetBSD and bzr for emacs. Honestly I&#x27;m glad he&#x27;s doing it, I&#x27;m hoping it might make it more likely for newcomers to contribute to these projects. He has posted quite a few articles about these conversions on his blog [0], if you want to read about it.<p>[0] <a href=""http://esr.ibiblio.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://esr.ibiblio.org/</a>",1415725203
