I guess a green check in the &#x27;Global&#x27; column implies a green check in all location specific columns?  But what about all the rows which have no Global green check, but most columns are still empty? Are those regions where the service is not deployed? Can we gray out those boxes or something if they are &#x27;N/A&#x27;?<p>Also, funny if you try to zoom out in Chrome to see the whole thing, the row headers get out of alignment.<p>Why would I want to &#x27;X&#x27; out specific rows/columns in the table? It was so complicated to begin with, someone thought adding more complication through end-user customization was a good idea?

Prices become more consistent. Lets look at one particular place: the Bid / Ask spread.<p>When you go to much less traded stuff like Bonds, or in the more extreme case... Real Estate... its harder to put an accurate price on these items.<p>A house might have an asking price of $300,000 but the only buyer might be offering only $250,000. If both sides refuse to budge, then the market stops moving.<p>A trader can move the market very simply in this case. He can buy the house at $265,000, and then sell it at $285,000. Everyone benefits from their perspective.<p>The Seller got to sell the house at higher than $250,000.
The Buyer got to buy the house lower than $300,000. 
The trader gets away with $20,000 made.<p>This is in essence, the trader&#x27;s low-risk function and his job is to move markets.<p>Now lets say a 2nd trader enters the market, and instead is willing to get away with only $10,000. He buys the house at $270,000, and sells it to the buyer at $280,000. Because this 2nd trader has better offers, he will get the cash.<p>So this leads to point #2: the more traders compete with each other, the tighter Bid/Ask spreads get, and the &quot;fairer&quot; the market price becomes.<p>When we get to the tens of thousands of traders who deal with high-volume stocks, these stocks end up having bid/ask spreads smaller than pennies. In fact, bid/ask spreads are so low during the trading day, that most people forget about them during trading!<p>But at the end of the day, stocks are like any other good.

I, like most Americans, demanded justice. But one common misconception is that the Patriot Act applies only to foreigners—when in reality, the Patriot Act was instituted precisely to widen the surveillance laws to include U.S. citizens,” Sen. Paul said, “As Benjamin Franklin put it, ‘those who trade their liberty for security may wind up with neither.’ Today’s vote to oppose further consideration of the Patriot Act extension proves that we are one step closer to restoring civil liberties in America.”",1416367294
