It was a 6 year process of being moved from specialist to specialist and every test you can imagine being run to understand what was wrong with me.<p>During that whole time almost everyone I encountered was very sympathetic and understanding.<p>It is also difficult as a patient not to be jaded. There are &quot;patients&quot; out there trying to scam the system that just want some doctor to sign a disability claim so they can collect a check without getting a job.  I&#x27;ve met numerous individuals where this is the case.  Then I see the doctors and they keep telling me that I should consider going on disability or find a less stressful line of work, because of my health. They tell me that it is only a matter of time before things get so bad I will no longer be able to make a choice.<p>I have a friend that has terminal cancer who plans to work until he dies. There are plenty of desk jobs; if this guy can sit up playing video games and such; he can likely hold down a job.",1416902382

8656796,comment,8652670,8652670,0,0,zvrba,,,"Um. From what I remember of having learned about capacitors in a basic physics course a long time ago, the net charge of the capacitor is always the same. When voltage is applied to a capacitor, it generates an electric field between the plates, which causes charge separation. The charge is already there, its source is the dielectric between the capacitor plates.<p>So charging the capacitor may make one plate slightly lighter, the other slightly heavier, but its overall mass is the same. Is it this mass change he&#x27;s trying to use?",1416902333

However, the comment I was making is whether the firmware (i.e. the bootloader, &quot;BIOS&quot; if you may - in particular the Secure OS) can be reflashed.<p>The reason the existing firmware could be desired to be  replaced is that the Secure OS component specifically disallows an OS to run in hypervisor mode (i.e. no KVM or Xen), or because of terrible bugs in HBOOT that cause hangs if the boot.img exceeds a certain arbitrary size (a few tens of MB). All these limitations mean that even an OEM-unlocked device is not quite entirely available to the mercy of a developer.<p>Of course, the ability to reflash the low-level boot code is not very useful unless you have sources to build a better replacement.",1416902287

8656784,comment,8652579,8655511,0,0,01Michael10,,,"I guess my argument has not been clear...<p>I am glad you are good at reading Wikipedia charts but ONCE AGAIN inflation has never been the only factor in first class stamp pricing then or now. Sure, over the long term the cost of anything will tend to match inflation. I have been mainly talking about recent short term pricing of stamps...<p>The original argument (by Alupis) was that the government privatizing the postal system has been making things better for consumers (compared to when it was a government agency). It has not... There has been nine price increases since 2001! This has NOT been because of inflation which has been minimal and stable. The reason has been pension mandates by the government (due to politics) and the decline of first class mail usage.<p>First class mail service has never been overly profitable which is why I argued a essential service like that is better run by the government (especially since the post office is not totally an independent enterprise anyway) and not a private profit-driven organization. The government never would have raised stamp prices nine times in the last 13 years (based on past history) if they were still running the post office which means stamp prices would not have keep pace with inflation (over the last 100 years) incidentally. They would most likely have addressed the pension mandate and taken other measures to keep stamp prices more stable (to not piss off the consumers aka voters). It is also doubtful they would be making deals with direct marketers to flood us with more junk mail.",1416902003

8656780,comment,8654824,8654824,0,0,chisophugis,,,"I spent about a week going through Mahajan&#x27;s OCW course &quot;the art of approximation&quot; (it&#x27;s quite short and reads quite quickly). It changed how I view problem solving and engineering estimation forever.<p>Grab &quot;entire book&quot; (about 130 pages) at <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-055j-the-art-of-approximation-in-science-and-engineering-spring-2008/readings/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-comput...</a><p>&quot;The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering&quot; looks like a refined and expanded version of the OCW course. Like 6.055J, I&#x27;m sure it can be read casually and in small pieces. Do yourself the favor of checking out 6.055J or &quot;The Art of Insight in Science and Engineering&quot; (although see the caveat below).<p>Every chapter of 6.055J was mind-blowing for me. The &quot;tree&quot; technique. Using dimensionless constants. The random walk model of errors (i.e. why approximations end up being pretty good usually). Easy cases. Etc. A lot of it is just becoming aware of techniques we already use subconsciously or awkwardly; hence we learn to systematically and effectively use them.<p>One small caveat: Some of the content unfortunately doesn&#x27;t extend super well into software/programming. Many of the useful properties that enable reasoning about physical systems (units, conservation laws, symmetry, equilibrium points/linearization, continuity, etc.) are not applicable to software in general since &quot;anything is possible&quot; in software. The software is basically in its own universe that has its own laws completely determined by the hardware/VM/language/API designers. It communicates with the &quot;real universe&quot; through very narrow and controlled channels. Some things from the book are applicable to software, but presented in a way that is strange or not terribly useful for software (e.g. &quot;proportional reasoning&quot; is just the familiar big-O reasoning).",1416901941

8656757,comment,8656028,8656133,0,0,vizeroth,,,"The reasons tend to vary by region, but they still often come down to people playing games with job postings to try to get someone to fill a role that is bigger than what they are willing to pay for. I&#x27;ve had two employers give me a job title that didn&#x27;t reflect the work I was doing, and allowed them to pay me less than they would with the correct title.<p>Job postings in my region tend to either have a pay range that looks like it belongs on a posting which requires 5 fewer years of experience, or they put something into the requirements as a &quot;must-have&quot; skill that would normally bump the rate.<p>Another part of the problem is that much of the educational system has put itself into the position of job training instead of educating when it comes to development and systems/network administration. It is often difficult or impossible to find a good curriculums for administration. Computer Science curriculums often choose languages based on the insistence of employers that those languages are necessary in the job market (though the average lifespan of some languages in the job market is less than the average student spends getting a BS in Computer Science).<p>Meanwhile, employers often mistake experience with a given language as a higher qualifier than overall development experience and ability to learn and adapt what you have learned in one language to working in another. This seems like it should be especially relevant in web development, since full-stack developers have to be familiar with front- and back-end languages, markup, stylesheets, and often at least a little SQL.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s high turn-over and the ever-present revolving door positions. I&#x27;ve met far too many people who go back to school to either get their MBA and move into management or to get a degree in something else just to get out of the field completely. People get stressed out, treated terribly, and often feel like they have to completely re-learn their job every few years to maintain basic skills. After 5 or 10 years they may reach the salary cap for their job title, and they may have no opportunities for upward movement in a technical position. A new person might come on board to do nearly the same job, sometimes with the same (or more) pay, while being less qualified and less capable.<p>All of these things still trend in one direction, though: employers undervalue an applicant&#x27;s overall experience while over-emphasizing a combination of skills which isn&#x27;t often found in one person, all because they not only aren&#x27;t willing to pay the going rate, but don&#x27;t even want to hire enough people to do the job.",1416901242

This is (more or less) what `malloc` does, if you&#x27;ve come across it. That&#x27;s the key difference: in a modern operating system, you can&#x27;t expect memory to be one big array, since your program might have requested more than one page of memory. In that sense, it&#x27;s more like a collection of smaller arrays.<p>We have to do it this way so we can have memory protection (similar to file permissions - a program can decide if other programs can read one of their pages, write to it, etc) and swapping (i.e writing unused pages to non-volatile storage , like a hard drive, to free memory).",1416900936

I don&#x27;t remember it exactly but it was such a crazy number to believe (relative to other sharpe ratios) that I stopped thinking it was a risk metric that mattered for my style of trading.",1416899028

From what I&#x27;ve seen in this area (I work for a shop with zOS and zLinux) IBM are getting heavily onboard the mobile-first bandwagon.  So REST-enable your existing transactional CICS code, get fast access to it via hipersockets to your node.js/zLinux server, and then deliver it to your front-ends.<p>[1] Define some bindings on your CICS side, run some JCL, now you have a REST service.",1416898883
