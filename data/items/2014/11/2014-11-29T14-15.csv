It&#x27;s readable enough but isn&#x27;t beautiful.<p>Battery life: Awful. Probably not helped by the slightly used battery or the 16GB RAM. The second drive tends to be spun down (it&#x27;s for occasionally-used / bulk storage only) and I tend not to be working the CPU hard. I just plug in.<p>Linux support: About as good as you&#x27;ll get, which means that it almost works flawlessly, but will still annoy you.<p>I&#x27;ve tried Linux in a VM too.

These are just the ones coming to my head:<p>Apple, Steve Jobs, widely known for being an asshole. Fucked over early employees.<p>Facebook, Zuck, completely fucked over his mates when money appeared.<p>Microsoft, Bill Gates, ruthlessly exterminated opposition and known for bullying staff.<p>Oracle, Larry Ellison<p>Zynga, Marcus Pincus, &quot;I Did Every Horrible Thing In The Book Just To Get Revenues&quot;.<p>Uber, acting like complete dicks.<p>Kim Dotcom, nuff said.<p>I think once you&#x27;ve been mean/ruthless/evil in business you may come out the other side and do some nice things, but you have to ask, will it ever be enough? Will Bill Gates ever make up for the billions of damage he caused humanity by using underhand tactics to destroy his opposition? Maybe. But while everyone praises him at the moment, I can&#x27;t help but think he deliberately held the internet back for 6 or 7 years for his own profit. You almost can&#x27;t start calculating the damage he caused precisely because it is so mind boggling.<p>Perhaps you don&#x27;t agree with me, but imho this is the most bizarre essay I&#x27;ve read by pg, and I really don&#x27;t agree with most of his political leanings, so for me that&#x27;s saying a lot.<p>The truly great startup founders have to be nice on the outside but when push comes to shove, complete assholes on the inside. And of course investors are going to see the nice side.<p>Edit: And it occurs to me, funnily enough pg seems to be one of the major counterexamples, a good founder, as when he setup YC it was a game changer because here was a rich dude taking time out to help a bunch of young people and then put his money where his mouth was when people started asking him &quot;so where do we get this seed funding&quot;. It was so remarkable because he actually took the time.<p>Edit 2: There seems to be some debate on the meaning of &quot;mean&quot;. I&#x27;d point to pg&#x27;s own essay on philosophy to dismiss this sophistry. He uses &quot;good&quot; and &quot;benevolent&quot; as the opposites, not &quot;polite&quot; or &quot;diplomatic&quot;.

This work, along with the previous work of reverse engineering handwritting recognizers is important for us to better understand what our tools are actually doing. A lot of what happens inside these ML algorithms is not terribly well understood, even by the creators, this work gives us a really good insight into what the mind of a machine is actually thinking. When I was a teacher, I used to try to make sure students understood things going both ways. This is very important work in this respect.<p>For people struggling to understand, it&#x27;s a little like having a tool that uses automatically generated regular expressions to find things in text, except you don&#x27;t know what regex the computer is actually using. For my name it could be as simply as &quot;bane&quot; or something crazy that a human would never think up, say b[a-z]+e. It matches my name, but it&#x27;s interesting to explore what else it matches: &quot;barserphursnatche&quot; is also perfectly acceptable. Remember, you don&#x27;t <i>know</i> what the computer is using to recognize things, so you have to simply probe: randomly generate strings, use some kind of genetic algorithm etc.<p>In the end, you probably won&#x27;t find b[a-z]+e, but you&#x27;ll find some expression with a sizable intersection like b[a-y][b-z]*e. Once you have that you can use the expression as a generator and build a list of all the possible names it will match with something like Microsoft&#x27;s Rex [1]<p>What we find is that lots of the stuff the computer likely matches are not my name at all, or even look like a name (e.g. &quot;baghuadsoadshasdguoasdughasdgaodsguafdghaufogafuhgafduoe&quot;) and it gives us insight into what it&#x27;s doing.<p>I think why I like this work is that it makes me think of a sci-fi short story:<p>- A boy encounters an alien civilization<p>- The boy befriends a robot from the civilization<p>- They go off on some adventures together<p>- During a scene of doubt in their relationship, during a stressful final adventure, the boy asks the robot what he thinks of him. The robot 3d-prints off one of these heads and gives it to the boy.<p>1 - <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/7f1d87be-f6d9-495d-a699-f12599cea030/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/7f1d87be-f6d9-...</a>",1417272475

8673823,comment,8670544,8672598,0,0,geebee,,,"Your definition of rich isn&#x27;t really something I can argue with.  But I would encourage you to take a look at salaries for various jobs in high paid areas, and use that as the bases for comparison.  One source I&#x27;ve used is US News Best Jobs.<p>The median salary for an application developer in San Jose is 116k.  For a registered nurse in San Jose, it is 122K.  Dental hygienists in San Francisco earn about 109k a year (median), developers in SF, about 110K.  Lawyers and Physicians, of course, earn considerably more.<p>Devs do alright by standards of skilled workers, but they&#x27;re not really outliers.  The widely held notion that devs are wildly overpaid and privileged workers has to go down as one of the great victories of silicon valley PR.<p>Now, I will agree that tech has create these salaries on a scale that didn&#x27;t exist before, which may be part of why the resentment occurs.  Dental hygienists at 109k a year simply can&#x27;t exist in numbers sufficient to cause displacement, because they draw their salaries largely from the local population.  That limits the ratio.  Tech, on the other hand, sells outside the region, so 100k+ salaried tech workers really aren&#x27;t limited in number by a local population they serve (and they can remain aloof or detached from that population).   Again, I&#x27;m not saying this is bad (or good), I&#x27;m just suggesting it as one possible explanation for why people resent tech salaries so much more than dental hygienist salaries.",1417272362

Overall I&#x27;d rate it a &quot;meh&quot;.  Great place to work, not terrible place to live (there are many worse alternatives).<p>My parents are shocked that their high school aged grandchild doesn&#x27;t see the point of sticking around the US, possibly not even for university (which would be free, and good, in his mother&#x27;s country).<p>For my parents, the US was so much better than their home countries (asian for one, oceania for the other) in terms of work opportunities, racial equality, and quality of life that they can&#x27;t conceive of wanting to live anywhere else.  I know this vividly because I remember it from my own childhood.  And their were fewer alternatives in the 60s and 70s and even the 80s.<p>But nowadays many countries have not only moved faster, but farther, surpassing the US in quality of life and economic prospects.

They are moving around too, and his Facebook feed is a jumble of posts in multiple languages.<p>And I think this is key: <i>Moving no longer has to cut you off from your family and friends.</i>  And because the internet is so cheap, this is true at most economic levels:  I saw a sign in Dubai a couple of years ago advertising a bed in a shared house.

There&#x27;s no path that can be followed that will terminate it:<p>The demon understands every part of your brain, and knows that if it says that you&#x27;re going to watch TV while you&#x27;re determined to prove it wrong will make you listen to the radio instead.

Since &#x27;inc&#x27; shouldn&#x27;t be any slower than &#x27;add&#x27;, I think this slowdown is either due to alignment or the greater density calls in the code. Maybe this is a case where the denser code needs to use the legacy decoder instead of the µop cache?<p>&#x27;icc -O3&#x27; produced strange code that ran slightly slower, at 4.5 cycles per call on Haswell, and 4.01 cycles on Sandy Bridge:<p><pre><code>  0000000000400c90 <f2>:
  400c90:       56                      push   %rsi

Can anyone tell me what it&#x27;s doing with those extra pushes and pops? I think they are just noise, but maybe they help with debugging or stack alignment?<p>Clang also produces odd code with extra pushes and pops, but somehow achieves the same speed as GCC on Haswell despite this (3.67 cycles).  Speed on Sandy Bridge was slow at 4.5 cycles:<p><pre><code>  00000000004005c0 <f2>:

It&#x27;s slim and light, I&#x27;ve used it for travelling between Europe and the US and it&#x27;s been fine on the move (definitely not as petite as other ultrabooks though).<p>The specs are below:<p>- Intel Core i7-4510U Processor

- AMD Radeon HD 8670M Graphics 2GB
- 16GB RAM
- Keyboard Backlit - UK English
- 256GB Solid State Drive Serial ATA3 OPAL2.0<p>I managed to get it for just over $1000 dollars yesterday so I know it&#x27;s a little out of your price range but I find the keyboard solid, screen is pretty good and I don&#x27;t notice any performance issues.

If you can measure that, then it ceases to be chaotic. Whether that&#x27;s possible (inferring intent), I am not sure.<p>> If there is free will that transcends physics, then prediction is fundamentally impossible by something bound to physics—so it&#x27;s a thought experiment where some things are bound to the laws of physics and others are not. What is the purpose of conducting thought experiments about the physical world, based on supernatural axioms?<p>I think these theoretical suppositions are based more on a fear of something that people imagine to be real, and may be real. Instead of supernatural beings, suppose there are people that define the world, and people that live within the definition. The fear that the groups are mutually exclusive leads is directly analogous to the philosophical problem.<p>> &quot;Free will exists,&quot; the claim goes, and yet &quot;here&#x27;s a thing that can collapse free will and issue arbitrarily accurate predictions on human behavior.&quot; And then, &quot;Let&#x27;s see what happens when these axioms are applied to someone in the physical world choosing whether to try to make more money or less.&quot;<p>The thing always depends on states of mind, explanations, the pretense of logic and maths, which ultimately convey themselves to me as rhetoric.
