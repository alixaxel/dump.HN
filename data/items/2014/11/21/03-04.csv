8639750,comment,8639317,8639578,0,0,dredmorbius,,,"All the more reason to be judicious in what new technologies are introduced.<p>One of the huge benefits of the Unix/Linux, CLI, and Free Software traditions is that they tend to be <i>very strongly preserving of established knowledge</i>.  Changes are incremental, usually additive, a reliance on scripting means that interfaces are unlikely to change, and new tools are very frequently drop-in replacements for old.<p>As specific examples:<p>I first learned editing under BSD vi in the mid 1980s.  In the time since I&#x27;ve learned and used on various PCs (and a few other systems):  WordPerfect, WordStar, MacWrite, AmiPro, several iterations of MS Word, the EDT and EVE editors under VAX, the TSO-ISPF editor, and a few others under Unix:  emacs, ae, nano, nedit, Abiword, Lyx, and various iterations of what&#x27;s now LibreOffice.  <i>Most of that skill-acquisition is now dead to me -- the tools simply aren&#x27;t available or aren&#x27;t useful.</i><p>I&#x27;m no longer using vi, but vim (adopted in the mid 1990s as I switched to Linux), but the basic muscle-memory is the same.  And its an editor I can utilize across a huge number of systems (though I do admit to finding traditional vi / nvi painful).<p>Similarly, the bash shell is an iteration on the basic Bourne and Korn shells.<p>ssh is a drop-in replacement for rsh, to the extent that /usr/bin/rsh is typically a symlink to ssh.  While the dynamic is <i>slightly</i> different from telnet, it&#x27;s still pretty similar with a few exceptions.<p>The rare occasions in which a utility changes its commandline options you&#x27;ll virtually <i>always</i> hear about it.  The fact that it&#x27;s so painful (and tends to break decades-old scripts) means its generally avoided.  Authors who make a point of doing this tend to find that people avoid their tools.<p>A bigger point is that <i>forgetting</i> stuff is often much harder (and more important) than <i>learning</i> stuff.  And when you&#x27;re invalidating long-established patterns, that&#x27;s really painful.<p>There&#x27;s also the fact that we manage technology by managing complexity, and most of us in the field work at the limits of our ability to manage the complexity we&#x27;re faced with:  the basic OS, shells and interpreters, hardware, vendors, hosting providers, management tools, employers, clients, customers, co-workers, engineering and development teams, services, abuse and security concerns.  It&#x27;s a really complex and dynamic field.<p>Linux has done quite well (with a few notable exceptions) of maintaining a balance between capabilities provided and complexity imposed.  One problem is that as systems become more complex, the additional benefits of yet more complexity are lower, and the costs are higher (this is a very general rule, not just specific to Linux, operating systems, or computers).<p>The question of <i>how to introduce radical change</i> is a key one.  I&#x27;ve seen a number of failed attempts to drastically revise existing systems in place -- this almost always fails.  Linux itself wasn&#x27;t introduced in this way -- it emerged <i>as an alternative</i> to both &quot;traditional&quot; proprietary Unices, to Big Iron (mainframes, VAX), and Microsoft&#x27;s then-new WinNT.  Linux ended up dominating virtually all of these categories, but it did so by incrementally beating out the competitors through replacement.<p>An interesting space where a lot of this comes to a head specifically is in the graphical user interface field.  I&#x27;ve noted several times that Apple, notable for a great deal of success in this area, has been <i>exceptionally</i> conservative in its GUI development.  It&#x27;s effectively had two GUIs, the initial Mac System interface, and Aqua.  Each has had a roughly 15 year lifespan, and yes, there was incremental improvement over the span of both, but the essential base remained the same.<p>Since the early 1990s, I&#x27;ve watched Unix/Linux go from twm to fvwm, Motif/mwm, VUE/CUE (a &quot;corporate&quot; standard based on Motif plus a desktop), Enlightenment, GNOME, and KDE, and now alternatives such as xfce4 and ... oh, that funky graphics thing Suse&#x27;s got, as the &quot;primary&quot; desktops.  GNOME and KDE themselves have gone through about three major revisions.  And there are a number of other &quot;lesser&quot; more minimal desktops as well -- I use one of these, WindowMaker, which is actually based in a late 1980s ancestor of the Aqua interface now used by Apple.<p>Microsoft&#x27;s experienced some similar recent tribulations.  As has pretty much every online site ever that&#x27;s done a site redesign.<p>As jwz has observed:  changes to GUIs <i>just don&#x27;t offer that much win</i>.  They&#x27;re highly disruptive, they&#x27;re possible because the interfaces generally <i>aren&#x27;t</i> scripted (other than via automated QA testing systems, but that&#x27;s another story), but more importantly:  the productivity benefits granted users really aren&#x27;t that significant, especially regards the cost.<p>Worse:  changing an <i>existing</i> interface leaves users in a no-recourse situation, <i>especially</i> in the case of SAAS.  For Linux and systemd, the options are slightly more open in that (for now) it&#x27;s possible to disable or block systemd from installing in at least some cases.  But over the long run, it may be that the only options are voice and exit, as opposed to loyalty (a reference to the book and concept of <i>Voice, Exit, and Loyalty</i>, which I recommend looking up).<p>So yes:  those of us with numerous decades of experience in the field often <i>do</i> have an extremely jaundiced view toward radical change.  And with very good reason.<p>But your comment is really unwarranted.",1416542358
8639749,comment,8638762,8639615,0,0,GuiA,,,"Yes, that&#x27;s what I bring up every time someone starts with the whole &quot;Uber is killing the poor taxi industry&quot; rhetoric. Before Uber, I only took taxis to/from airports, so maybe half a dozen times a year.<p>Now, I take Uber at least once a week. Going out with friends? I&#x27;m going to spend money on dinner/drinks anyway, what&#x27;s an added $10 in Uber fares to save me 40 minutes of public transportation? Every time a new type of business replaces an older model, the market size necessarily increases because the new model is faster, cheaper, better, etc so new customers are attracted.<p>I don&#x27;t get why taxi companies aren&#x27;t putting all of their resources into creating an Uber like infrastructure for themselves right now. It&#x27;s clearly the way of the future, and 10 years from now the traditional model of standing on the sidewalk with your arm raised until some taxi driver feels like picking you up will be long gone, whether they like it or not. They might dig their heels in the ground and try to pass legislation all they want, that&#x27;s just the way it&#x27;s going. Their only chance of survival is trying to beat Uber at their own game, and every day that they spend lobbying in Washington or putting crappy ads on buses [0] is a day lost for their cause.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/GjJZQAM.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/GjJZQAM.jpg</a>",1416542347

Each game ships with an &quot;IOS&quot;: effectively an OS kernel+initrd update package. Every game boots to the newest IOS available, so if one game updates to IOS v6653, then another game that only shipped with IOS v6652 will find the newer version on disk and use it.<p>However, a game&#x27;s IOS requirement doesn&#x27;t just have a version; it also has a <i>slot</i>. Each console has space for 256 individual copies of IOS, which are each <i>independently</i> versioned. So if two games both use IOS[58], then the game providing v6653 will overwrite v6652 on disk, and then the game providing v6652 will boot into v6653. But if one game is providing a version of IOS[58], and the other is providing a version of IOS[61], then their effects on one-another are isolated.<p>You can think of it a bit like the IOS codebase having 256 branches, and each piece of software being able to specify which branch of the kernel it was developed on. It gets the newest kernel released <i>on that branch</i>.<p>This allows a sort of &quot;move fast and break things&quot; approach to kernel development, where a kernel can be hacked to support new software in a way that breaks old software: you just stick your modified kernel into an as-yet-unused IOS slot, and old software will have nothing to worry about. This approach has resulted in my own (pretty unused) Wii U having ~73 different IOS slots populated with kernels.<p>Interestingly, if you think about it, this is pretty much a continuation of what Nintendo was allowing developers to do before: shipping random collections of chips in their own cartridges that DMA to the console, effectively creating their own extended console to run upon. Allowing your software to ship its own kernel is basically the software equivalent.",1416539242

EDIT: I want to emphasize that I am trying to write this comment neutrally, not endorsing either side, so while my biases may sneak in, my intention is to be fair to both sides. Both sides have arguments in their favour, and I&#x27;d hope people consider both before coming to a conclusion.<p>All Unix-based systems start by running a single process known as &#x27;init&#x27; which is responsible for setting up the system, starting all other programs, and managing various services as they run. The change under contention is the widespread inclusion of a relatively new piece of software called systemd, which replaces the historically popular sysvinit, Ubuntu&#x27;s alternative known as upstart, and various other competing systems. All of these are different approaches to building an init system.<p>In contrast to some of the other systems, systemd is written less in terms of traditional Unix-style tools (like pipes and plain text files for storage), choosing instead to build on newer and more elaborate communication interfaces and store in specially designed binary formats. Systemd consists of a large family of interrelated pieces of software, many of which are nominally optional but generally expect to be used together. One point of contention is whether systemd is &quot;too large&quot;, as proponents argue that developing these pieces together will increase their quality, while detractors argue that this makes it too difficult to substitute components if necessary and that these pieces should not be part of the same conceptual package.<p>Additionally, the architectural choices of a large, widely-used package integral to the functioning of a running system will influence the design and assumptions of other pieces of software and even Linux itself. Already, the Linux kernel has incorporated the newer communication systems used by systemd into the operating system itself (the mentioned KDBus), which many believe to be a sign that the inclusion of systemd will change the way that Linux operates and the way programs expect to interact with the kernel and with each other.<p>An important factor here, whether good or bad, is that these choices make Linux into a very different system than it has been historically, and very different than other Unix variants. Proponents argue that this is a step forward, as the facilities offered by Linux historically might not be appropriate tools for the current uses of Linux. Detractors disagree. Either way, the conclusion is that systemd is a change in the way the operating system is structured and used which has been a major point of contention in some communities.",1416539091
