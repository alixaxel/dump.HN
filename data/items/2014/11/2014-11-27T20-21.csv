It&#x27;s quite common during the course of a cold or similar infection that patients will complain of having increased depressive symptoms.<p>However inflammation is a very generic phenomenon which implies a greatly diverse range of influences operating to bring about emergence of MDD.  For example, depression frequently accompanies post-surgical recovery which evokes inflammatory responses even in the absence of infection.<p>While an infectious form of MDD is plausible, it wouldn&#x27;t be the only important source of depressive conditions.  In this sense, MDD is like a &quot;final common pathway&quot;, the idea that clinically visible syndromes comes about through numerous paths.  The key concept is that the mechanisms leading to the final path segment can be dissimilar and even non-overlapping.<p>It means there&#x27;s truly no distinct, singular &quot;cause&quot; of the condition, or rather there are numerous disease processes that happen to present similarly.",1417121981

Finally, in the last few years, there are some serious attempts at doing so (Rust comes to mind). But it&#x27;s taken this long and that astounds me.<p>You&#x27;ll get no argument from me that a language needs direct access to memory. My problem is that the difference between correct code and exploitable code is extreme diligence on the part of the programmer, which fails constantly. [Arguably static analysis type tools can help a lot, but, that&#x27;s just trying to recover from an already bad situation.]<p>For example, in the prequel to the OP&#x27;s article (<a href=""http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2014/07/pwn4fun-spring-2014-safari-part-i_24.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2014/07/pwn4fun-spring...</a>), the original bug was overflowing an unsigned int. You should be spitting out your coffee! (/beverage of choice) How can it be be that a (presumably expert) programmer can write code that silently overflows integers <i>by accident</i>?<p>&quot;It&#x27;s 2014 and this still happens.&quot;
That&#x27;s my favorite non-argument. It&#x27;s not constructive but it expresses how I feel. We&#x27;re well past the years where people have had time to reflect on the fact that people have already  struggled with and tried to solve the problem that <i>this should simply not be possible</i>. I don&#x27;t need a fancy type system to enforce &#x27;checked integers&#x27; are the only things that are passed to to my memcpys - but I do have to be willing, at some point, to discard the broken versions of the same thing I&#x27;ve been holding on to for 30 years in favor of something less perilous.<p>Oh, and, if you read the rest of that prequel article, the person who fixed the bug missed something else in doing so. They&#x27;re adding overflow-safe versions of &#x27;size_t&#x27; and &#x27;unsigned int&#x27; together. Again, embarrassing. Not for their error, but because we-as-a-species are still writing code where that mistake can be made, and then not doing anything about it when it inevitably happens.",1417120733

Org-mode already scales beautifully regarding complexity, and i think the main thing that turns people away from it is that the manual is a literal textbook and only silly people study it back to back.

She had only a room that she was renting, and her landlord didn&#x27;t want an extra person staying there. We decided to by a VW van simply to avoid paying rent. It was a really good decision. We didn&#x27;t have much money, but had enough to live comfortably. In fact it is really easy to live in San Francisco without spending any money. I cooked for food not bombs, we dumpster-dove at Rainbows, got more fruit and veggies at The free farmstand, and went out to dinner every Tuesday at Curry without Worry (I recommend it for everybody). I even acquired my tech skills at Noisebridge.<p>We had a kitchen in our bus, so we cooked most of our food. We even made homemade jam and tried to make granola in our van. We had a french press, on sometimes invited friends and our neighbours over for coffee. We even had internet most of the time (donated by friendly neighbours at the pipe organ factory).<p>We had planned for me to successfully immigrate (that is legally, we got married and all) but the bureaucracy and the money and uncertainty it would have taken was overwhelming (marriage is not enough if you don&#x27;t have money). So we just decided for me to stay there illegally while she finished her school.<p>We moved to Reykjavík before I had overstayed for too long (6 months have no severe consequences for a white boy like me), where I work at a small startup as a web-developer and designer. It was really wonderful times. In fact the freedom of owning your own place (that is our car) was awesome. Of course there were difficult moments, not being able to shower frequently was one of them. But all in all the experience was good.<p>As for whom to help if you care about the homeless. In my view just general good manners are always the first thing that I thing of. Not to call the police on people would be a good start. Oh yes, and if you have a business that throws away food <i>don&#x27;t</i> lock the dumpstes. Organizations like Food not Bombs, and Homes not Jails are really helpful. Of course my experience is radically different from people that become homeless out of desperation, and in fact their experience is radically different from people that become homeless out of drug addiction or mental health problems (which is also a really varied group).",1417118439
