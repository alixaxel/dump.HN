This could only enhance the problem solving ability of the group as a whole. I would suggest that like minded people congregate, but do so with an awareness of how group psychology operates.<p>Actually, it&#x27;s not just industry that needs to change, but humanity as a whole. We can&#x27;t keep going around unaware of group psychology and the emotional and irrational distortions it produces. We might as well start with industry, particularly the startups. It&#x27;s exactly this sort of self-awareness that they&#x27;re supposed to be good at.",1415159964

8560457,comment,8557609,8560405,0,0,derefr,,,"VT-d in particular gives you the ability to expose one piece of hardware (that knows how to partition itself in some way) as multiple devices on the PCIe bus. With cgroup support, a container could be assigned one of the split devices, and act within the container as if it were the whole device. This is what regular hypervisors do, but they require a full set of virtualized devices (a virtual CPU, a virtual memory, etc.) while this approach allows you to virtualize only the resources your containers actually want to contend over.<p>So you could have, say, one virtual ethernet card per container (letting you run a container as a promiscuous-mode packet filter for its own VPC subnet, while still not being able to snoop on other VPCs&#x27; traffic) or one virtual GPU per container (allowing you to containerize OpenCL apps), while still having your containers acting like regular processes otherwise.",1415159805

I think we can all agree with that. But what exactly do you want the other 99% of us who just happen to have been born into the majority to do?</i><p>Create an atmosphere where people can talk about things that make them uncomfortable. Granted, much of the language and distorted dogma around race and gender issues has made this difficult. It&#x27;s anti-intellectual claptrap to label things like objectification and stereotyping as things that are like &quot;sin.&quot; Those are epiphenomena of human social information processing. They are things to be aware of, not things to shame people with.<p>The good news in that, is that the same things one does to foster honest and direct communication around technical issues are the same things one does to foster honest and direct communication around social issues. The bad news in this, is that to accomplish that, you are going to have to get past a lot of the BS and recrimination that acts as a barrier. (For the record, I think the way &quot;political correctness&quot; is currently implemented doesn&#x27;t help on the whole.)<p><i>This sounds like she&#x27;s most comfortable working only with black people - in which case, the pleas for all-inclusive diversity sound a bit hollow...</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that she only wants to hang out with black people. It&#x27;s that she wishes she felt as comfortable around tech coworkers as she does in predominantly black settings. Is it possible that she&#x27;s doing things that exacerbate her feelings? Sure. Again, that&#x27;s something to be cured with honest and direct communication.<p>If we all rationally applied what we now know about group psychology, we should anticipate many of the events and situations she described happening. Also, if the entire group of coworkers were anticipating and applying such knowledge, I would posit things would go differently. Unfortunately, the fear and social coercion around the current version of &quot;political correctness&quot; work against this and instead produce an atmosphere of fear and tiptoeing around hair-triggers for fear of being tarred with labels synonymous with villainy. Could you imagine such an atmosphere around implementing continuous integration, or effective testing, or coding practices?<p>Instead, encountering different cultures/sub-cultures should be considered an instance of encountering &quot;known unknowns.&quot; One should go into the situation with a stance of discovery. That is what &quot;cultural sensitivity&quot; should really mean, not this tiptoeing/gotcha game BS that we play.<p>EDIT: A series of questions for 3rd party readers: Is your workplace about &quot;open and honest motivated problem solving&quot; in the social dimension? Or is it more like &quot;tiptoeing around gotchas?&quot; Or is it a combination of the two concerning different social issues? What does it mean?",1415159526

Bacteria can gain the immunities from other bacterial species through plasmids. In the same way, people can appropriate ideas from other cultures/sub-cultures.<p><i>This is called &quot;island species&quot; : where there are barriers that prevent gene/meme transmission</i><p>What the historical record would suggest, is that effective barriers to memetic transmission are the exception rather than the rule.

8560336,comment,8557958,8560138,0,0,waps,,,"That&#x27;s because cultures change on timescales of centuries. If it works at all like gene transmission works, it isn&#x27;t worth adapting the culture : one of the cultures will die out in less than the time it would take to adapt.<p>This is called &quot;island species&quot; : where there are barriers that prevent gene/meme transmission (like an ocean before the internet), you can have different cultures/races. If you take away the barrier (in Darwin&#x27;s book it was a rock surfacing that allowed birds to fly from one island to another), one of the cultures will die due to cross-pollination. It is theorized that for memes, racism is one such boundary.<p>In history you do see this happen. Racism occurs because only a single group lives in an area. For some reason (war, natural disaster, ...) a large group of foreignors moves in, peacefully (rarely) or not. Then there is a period of time where there is obvious racism, and it disappears. Once it&#x27;s gone one of the cultures vanishes entirely, and racism slowly starts to rebuild.<p>So don&#x27;t worry : your kids will have much less problems than you do, and your grandchildren will not even know what different cultures are anymore. Ironically, these days, racism is the one of the last things remaining that can keep cultures going in the 21st century. If we destroy that, a single monoculture (one of the existing cultures, by numbers, I&#x27;d say probably Chinese culture, by far the most homogeneous at such a size) will expand and destroy everything else.",1415156676

Hes created a great company (and has done so several times- orgoo, adly, etc.) He has proven his worth and IAC is getting greedy. Yes, there appears to have been slight mistakes lately, but this is a guy who has created a company worth over a billion- Give him some slack. The fact they are pulling this shit is ridiculous, when tinder likely has more value than IAC itself if it wasnt for the public market. If tinder was private, its valuation would likely trump that of IAC. I only wish him the best- Honestly my advice to him would be to drop it and move on.
