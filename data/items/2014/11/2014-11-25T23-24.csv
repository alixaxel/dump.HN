8660421,comment,8659601,8660285,0,0,ms705,,,"Thanks for the comments! :) [Full disclosure: I&#x27;m the first author of the APSYS paper and one of the researchers working on DIOS.]<p>Cautionary note: the APSYS paper was written in April 2013 -- at the time, there was little more than the idea of &quot;maybe someone should look into distributed OSes for data centres&quot;. Much time has passed since, and there is now a DIOS prototype as well as far more design work. Things have concretized significantly since.<p>The target environment for DIOS is a shared, multi-user, multi-job cluster, such as Google&#x27;s warehouse-scale data centres: an environment where many different tasks run, which selectively share data but which must also be isolated from each other. (Consider, for example, a front-end web server that obtains records from a back-end key-value store, and which produces logs that are later processed by batch jobs.)<p>&quot;Data intensitivity&quot; comes into this by virtue of the scale of the overall system (thousands of tasks/machines), but also via the applicable optimizations. For example, one key optimization is caching of data in memory (cf. Spark, Tachyon). True, this can be done in middleware (as these examples show), but arguably the OS already does it (viz. the buffer cache). Unifying the OS notion of caching (usually at inode/block level) and the distributed system&#x27;s notion (at object level) seems like a reasonable proposition. Likewise, the OS kernel scheduler&#x27;s long-term load-balancer and the cluster scheduler likely have information that they would benefit from sharing (e.g. about the interaction of different tasks sharing a machine).<p>DIOS is a research project that aims to find out <i>if</i> there is gain to be had from changing the OS -- we set out to answer the question, rather than knowing what we wanted to find! (The APSYS paper was testing the waters in terms of what other people think, and we got some useful feedback from it.)<p>So far (bearing in mind that the work is ongoing), it looks like the compelling advantages from changing the kernel abstractions are:<p>1. Complete control over data-flow: being able to actually <i>enforce</i> policies like &quot;the task may only use its inputs to deterministically generate its outputs&quot; (as commonly assumed -- but not enforced -- in systems like MapReduce, Dryad, CIEL etc.). When running an application with DIOS system calls only, we know for sure that there is no way I/O can have happened other than via these system calls and on the objects exposed to the task. This is something only the kernel can ensure.<p>2. Opportunities for end-to-end performance optimization: by having clear semantics of abstractions that are valid across machines, we can move away from the conventional wisdom that the OS should treat all communication equally. Concretely, the buffer copy implied in using BSD sockets for network communication and the generality of a kernel network stack are two examples of one-size-fits-all OS design that we can side-step: in one use-case, we fast-track UDP packets destined for a coordination service in user-space through a network stack bypass that delivers them at far lower latency. DIOS can make this optimization because it has semantic information about the low-latency needs of the application available. (For sure, there are other ways of implementing this, but they either involve kernel changes or give up the ability to track network data-flow [e.g. kernel bypass solutions]).<p>3. Convenient removal of scalability-inhibiting abstractions: it&#x27;s well known that some POSIX APIs induce poor scalability (see e.g. the Commuter work from MIT in SOSP 2013). One key example is the notion that FD numbers are allocated in a monotonically increasing sequence (thus requiring synchronization between threads). By redesigning the abstractions for data-intensive applications, we can fix these sorts of problems in passing.<p>Hope that helps!",1416958219

8660410,comment,8658500,8659854,0,0,jude-,,,"I took a quick look.<p>I have some doubts about your anti-Sybil attack measures:<p>* The more CPU my arbiter nodes can prove that I have, the heavier my arbiter vote.  But at the same time, I can pretend to be many, many small nodes, which I&#x27;ll program to side with my arbiters if someone challenges them as being corrupt.<p>* Can&#x27;t I just DDoS the other nodes to increase the likelihood that my (sybil) nodes will be selected to be arbiters?  I&#x27;ll just attack nodes (or attack the request submitter) until you pick a quorum of my sybil nodes by chance.<p>* If all it takes to write to a DHT node is some user&#x27;s signature on the data (that or an arbiter log; I&#x27;m assuming from your wording that one or the other or both will suffice), can&#x27;t I just create a bunch of key-pairs for each of my sybil nodes and pretend to be a bunch of different users?<p>Regarding code:<p>* What steps do you take in the sandbox to prevent the (untrusted) code from denying service to participants?   I could use some malicious code to deny service to other nodes (helping my nodes get selected to be arbiters).<p>* No entropy in the sandbox will limit the things you can do here.  You can&#x27;t (safely) do cryptography, for example.<p>Regarding storage:<p>* Have you heard of Permacoin? [1]  You can have proof-of-storage without arbiters or a DHT.<p>* Even then, Permacoin is slow--way too slow for interactive I/O.  So is Bitcoin.  Your system will be slow as well, since you&#x27;re not only replicating writes to a blockchain, but also you&#x27;re funneling them through a handful of nodes that were chosen for their CPU, not their network connectivity.  Note that you&#x27;re writing multiple sets of entries per computation (the arbiter log), in addition to storing the results of the computation.<p>Regarding presentation:<p>* Outline your goals up front, as a bullet-point list.<p>* Outline similarities and differences with related work as a grid, with the set of systems as rows and the set of features as columns.  This will make it easier for readers familiar with other systems to quickly grasp what your system does and does not do (readers will look to the text for clarification of the table).<p>* If you&#x27;re constructing a protocol, you should consider adding a protocol diagram for both the successful case and the error cases.  You should also show (or prove) that your protocol makes certain guarantees, if possible.<p>Hope this helped!<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cs.umd.edu/~elaine/docs/permacoin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.umd.edu/~elaine/docs/permacoin.pdf</a>",1416958118

If it <i>does work</i> it&#x27;s not pointless. If it doesn&#x27;t — it very much might be. So everything depends on definition of &quot;working&quot;, which is different in different situations, depending on what result we want to get from our activities.<p>Consequently, all of your &quot;education-based&quot; examples are bad, as somebody might claim Cisco certification, school and/or college are pointless and even be completely right. In the most philosophical sense nothing is really pointless of course, but if you are coming to me asking for advice you probably don&#x27;t want the &quot;most philosophical answer&quot; and depending on your goals and personality (even in very broad sense) I could declare many popular things people are paying for as &quot;pointless&quot; for you. Because they &quot;don&#x27;t work&quot;, or the costs/profit ratio is too high compared to other options.<p>Your &quot;math&quot; example is also quite unfortunate (however I must warn you I haven&#x27;t read the article you are referring to), as if there actually was disagreement on if something is or isn&#x27;t a proof — it really could and should be &quot;legitimately dismissed&quot;. It might not be actually <i>wrong</i>, but you either accept something as proof, or you don&#x27;t.<p>Now, it&#x27;s true that there isn&#x27;t one good definition on what proof actually is. Actually, there are doubts that that definition is even possible. And it&#x27;s nothing new, it&#x27;s almost 100 years now that this is a problem for mathematical society.<p>So how my last two points go together? Perfectly fine, actually, because depending on your views on the problem of defining proof something can or can not be proof, and these views can differ drastically depending on whether you are a member of Bourbaki group or a layman. For example, Alexander Grothendieck dismissed (quite &quot;legitimately&quot;, by the way) the famous proof of &quot;4 color theorem&quot; and he is completely fine mathematician, and that proof is something that you will probably claim to be proof.<p>The similar problems I see in your &quot;different languages&quot; example, but it would take a bit longer to explain, so whatever.<p>Methodologies and even many of quite arguable &quot;best practices&quot; aren&#x27;t pointless, because they <i>do</i> work, not because &quot;disagreement doesn&#x27;t matter&quot;. Actually, I would claim that disagreement <i>does</i> matter, because there&#x27;s a good chance that one side will be proven to be &quot;more right&quot; than the other over time.

Now as for check-ins, the check-ins are NOT location based. Rather, they are personal and private check-ins, in response to the question, ‘how are you doing?’, where only the user can view them. When you connect with family and friends, all they’ll be able to see is that you’ve checked-in on PINE, but not what you’ve actually written down in your private reflection.

We considered L4::Fiasco, xv6 and Barrelfish, and investigated Barrelfish in depth. (L4 and xv6, at least at the time, were available for 32-bit only, which clearly wasn&#x27;t going to cut it for a warehouse-scale OS.) Ultimately, we went with Linux over Barrelfish due to the more comprehensive driver support, better documentation and the fact that it works on our test machines.<p>Barrelfish had great trouble booting on one of our machines with a lot of physical memory; after patching it, we managed to boot it, but did not have PCIe devices available (required for networking). To their credit, the Barrelfish team were very supportive, but progress was slow and working with Linux allowed us to get started right away.<p>However, using Linux has also bought us into a bunch of annoying non-scalable implementation choices. For example, DIOS relies on fast memory mapping, but Linux serializes all access to the mm_struct for a process using a single semaphore.<p>That said, DIOS is (deliberately) written in such a way that it should be possible to port it to other host kernels. Specifically, the kernel code consists of three parts:
 1. a small patch to route the new system calls to handlers;
 2. a BSD-licensed core module that contains the DIOS logic, but which is implemented in standard ANSI C and does not rely on any Linux-specific kernel features;
 3. a GPL-licensed &quot;DIOS abstraction layer&quot; (DAL), which offers access to the Linux kernel facilities for process and memory management, VFS calls, etc.<p>While our current prototype is for Linux only, we intend to revisit the Barrelfish port and will also look into porting DIOS to a BSD OS in the future. Barrelfish especially should be interesting -- it&#x27;s a very good fit for DIOS&#x27;s abstractions.",1416956638

People have a hard time distinguishing between a particular fact, their significantly broadened interpretation of that fact and its consequences, and a whole bunch of related non-facts that fit the racist narrative they&#x27;re tempted to think. We&#x27;re, apparently, collectively bad at avoiding thoughts like &quot;Jews own the media&quot; or even coming to conclusions like &quot;so, let&#x27;s kill all the Jews&quot;. To protect ourselves from the fragility and  inaccuracy of our thoughts in relation to group identity, we stigmatize racism. Which is great, I hope we continue this &quot;moral fashion&quot;, because the alternative is grotesque.",1416956529

A native-monochrome LCD would actually have advantages over color LCDs because you have reduced bits per pixel, need less power per pixel, and actually increase the number of addressable pixels. E-paper displays are great for reading from but not good for interacting with in any active way. Pixel Qi is an interesting medium but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s quite there yet?",1416956528

The healthcare sector seems an especially ripe area that hasn&#x27;t been fully exploited. With drug development still so expensive, it seems likely that a Big Data breakthrough could push the total cost down by an order of magnitude.<p>The biggest thing that I didn&#x27;t see mentioned in this VC post was the impact of something like AWS. Sure, data storage costs have dropped. But the real cost savings is being able to harness thousands of processors by the drip. As the cloud processing costs go down, the Big Data market will go up and up.",1416956514

We&#x27;re slipping back to a grim time of incarceration for the mentally ill by family members who disapprove of their lifestyle. While modern facilities are not the horror they once were, make no mistake that they are not places of adequate treatment. This is going to keep people from seeking treatment in the first place knowing that once you get that label, you can be taken by force for no reason, predicated on the idea that the mentally ill have a slightly higher chance of commiting a mass shooting. Pre-crime. It is so stupid and backwards and scary. Not so easy as &quot;Please leave me alone.&quot;<p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/articles/los-angeles-county-approves-involuntary-mental-health-care-1405462530"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/articles/los-angeles-county-approves-i...</a>",1416956457
8660300,comment,8657839,8659533,0,0,gjm11,,,"> why would you ever publish it?<p>Suppose you have a miraculous trading algorithm that you believe makes somewhat above-market returns with somewhat below-market risks, but you have only a small amount of capital you&#x27;re happy to gamble with.<p>Then what you can do by keeping your algorithm to yourself is: have investments that perform slightly better than most other people&#x27;s. That&#x27;s nice, for sure, but getting rich that way takes a long time unless you start out quite rich (or gamble a lot and get lucky, but that&#x27;s also a way to get poor).<p>On the other hand, what you get by publishing it might be a lucrative job offer at a hedge fund or investment bank, who hope you can use the skills you&#x27;ve just demonstrated to get them an extra 0.1% of return on their $10B pot. Now you have the opportunity to apply the same techniques to thousands of times more money than before, along with much more data and a server room full of hardware for backtesting and other smart people who will look at your clever ideas and maybe notice if there&#x27;s a big mistake or omission. Of course most of the gains from your miraculous algorithm now go to the investors, and most of the rest probably go to other people with more seniority, but you are still likely to get rich faster and more reliably that way.<p>I make no claim about the particular algorithm here or the person who published it. But the above seems to me like a pretty plausible reason why someone might prefer to publish, even if they have good reason to think their algorithm works.",1416956442

Paranoid schizophrenia can be quite debilitating because it affects one of the most critical aspects of human living: the ability to determine what is real and what isn&#x27;t.<p>I agree with the points you&#x27;re making, but most people suffering from psychotic conditions tend to prefer being in a lucid, non-psychotic state. It can be like waking someone up from a dream, or more often, a nightmare. Unfortunately, this can often only be done with the use of anti-psychotics, which can sometimes cause horrible side effects; in some cases so horrible they affect someone&#x27;s life more than the psychosis itself.<p>Regardless, I don&#x27;t think concern about this man&#x27;s condition is condescending.",1416956408
