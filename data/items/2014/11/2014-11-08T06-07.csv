Ignoring for a moment the complete absence of evidence or facts to support his claim, his argument fails the most basic scrutiny -- his reason has nothing to do with regulating data brokers.<p>The segue from personality tests -- an odd digression, to say the least -- into hand wringing over the possibility of employers secretly using lists based on health conditions is just absurd. Enacting regulations to address a problem we have literally never seen happen is the essence of bureaucratic incompetence.<p>It only becomes truly spectacular when you consider that regulating the company that sells the data does nothing to prevent employers from doing it anyway.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.privacyrights.org/how-private-my-credit-report"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.privacyrights.org/how-private-my-credit-report</a>",1415429940

Go&#x27;s lack of go routine isolation and error handling will never allow it to properly handle the problems Erlang was designed for without a lot of defensive programming and pain.  Start 20,000->30,000 go routines and have one of them crash, taking down the other 29,999 go routines and now try and debug that problem in production?  Go tries to advertise that it was built writing important services in, but it&#x27;s shared everything model really argues against that.  Erlang&#x27;s hot code loading, runtime inspection, production quality REPL, and process isolation makes it a completely different language than Go.  Until Go routines and channels get way way better, I would never attempt to write a distributed server that needs high availability in Go, it is just too fragile atm.<p>On the other side of the coin, if I wanted to write a simple command line tool quickly that was easy to deploy to many servers, Go might be a great choice, where Erlang is a bit painful for small and simple programs.",1415428791

8576226,comment,8574739,8576183,0,0,cromwellian,,,"Umm, no, absolutely 100% backwards. Inbox was designed 100% as a goal directed product based on making the user more efficient and satisfying his needs, technical decisions came later. Product design was done by product managers and interaction designers by taking into account usability study feedback. We didn&#x27;t just have engineers making stuff up cause they liked it, our users told use what their email pain points were. None of the internal presentations on Inbox&#x27;s development by the designers mention the client implementation details. It&#x27;s not the inmates running it, it&#x27;s the people outside the asylum. The basic facts on the ground. Most access to email is going mobile. The design is to fit the users as they are coming.<p>If we designed product features based on technical decisions, we would not have had so much trouble, because we would have simply picked the lowest common denominator we could get away with to deliver the product and not pushed on sharp edges in the stack.<p>We take a design based on how the product must or should behave, the engineers do not run the show.<p>As an aside, I value the Web not because of implementation details (I&#x27;m not a particular fan of CSS or JS) but because of high level properties it has that native mobile apps do not have. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d rather see a return to web applications over time. Web apps produce positive net externalities that native silos do not.<p>These don&#x27;t matter for the short term, or the individual, but they matter collectively over the long term for society. I may not be able to access content siloed to apps 30 years from now, but I&#x27;ll probably still be able to find Web content indexed and stored on archive.org<p>I view developing for the Web as planting trees in a forest that is logged for value over time by society, by businesses, that extract value. We are caretakers of it, and should put back into it so that the those who come after us can derive value as well.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how developing a native iOS app, for example, will help our grandkids the way making an open ecosystem and publishing lots of content that can be freely indexed, mashed up, and repurposed will. I imagine future archaelogists will have a much easier time digging up value from the Web than trying to dig up App Stores for information.",1415428528

Completely separate processors on the same memory bus that allow higher IO speeds than the main processor.  But since it can only be coded in assembly, Altera SOCs are much more attractive.  Instead of cortex M4s, there is an FPGA on the same chip.  Instead of making the interprocessor feature a crippled afterthought, the FPGA/ARM interface is central to the system, and the bus can be made as wide as practical.  Since you can create the precise peripheral to suit your application on the FPGA, its kind of a blank slate.<p>Edit: As it turns out, there is now a C compiler for the PRU, 3 years after the hardware was released.<p><a href=""http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/PRU-ICSS_Getting_Started_Guide"" rel=""nofollow"">http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/PRU-ICSS_Getting_Sta...</a>",1415428325

8576199,comment,8573992,8574242,0,0,tsotha,,,">FWIW, one of the most commonly believed things about Japan (domestically and internationally) that I believe is dangerously false is some variant of &quot;Japan is not good at coming up with original ideas. It is good at perfecting ideas made elsewhere.&quot;<p>Did anyone ever really believe that?  When a company is new to a market or behind the market leader they tend to copy the leader and add their own small innovations.  That&#x27;s what the Japanese did in the &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s.  When they took the lead in an industry they were the ones doing the innovation, for the most part.<p>I remember the &quot;Japan is going to take over the world!&quot; days.  American companies (and workers) were fond of saying the Japanese never had an original idea, but even then it was obviously sour grapes from incumbents facing determined competition.<p>You hear the same thing about China today, and it&#x27;s just as wrong.",1415427158

8576191,comment,8573347,8573347,0,0,zebracanevra,,,"The solution to deadlocking is using async all the way down - i.e. don&#x27;t use .Result.
you can also tell C# not to resume on the same context after an async call by using .ConfigureAwait(false) on the tasks, thus preventing two locks on a context, and the deadlock.<p>The author states two threads accessing a single resource is a race-condition, but that&#x27;s only true when the threads are competing for that resource - in the case outlined in the article, it would be sequential, and only one thread would be accessing the resource at one time. No race condition.<p>I think it&#x27;s not too wise to think of async/await as a special coroutine which never uses multiple threads, but as an easy way to write synchronous code and have it execute asyncronously. If you need fine control over what threads are used, maybe you&#x27;re better off controlling it manually.",1415426794
