Things that common sense will tell you are super dangerous really aren&#x27;t, and conversely things that common sense tells you should be safe are not at all safe.",1417161404
8670047,comment,8669044,8669875,0,0,alecdbrooks,,,">I&#x27;m guessing that this is wrong, though, and that the radioactivity from longer half-life radionuclides will eventually start to dominate and the &quot;effective half-life&quot; will be much longer.<p>Exactly. From a report on Chernobyl [0]: &quot;Most of the decrease [in radiation] in the coming years will be at only the rate of the physical half-life of 137Cs.&quot; Cesium-137  has a half-life of 30 years [1], so if we use the number given in the article (10,000 roentgens/hour) the dose is apparently 434 million times background radiation, 23 microroentgens/hour [2]. It would take over a millennium to reduce Cesium-137 by a factor of 434 million[3]<p>That&#x27;s the Elephant&#x27;s Foot, though. Randall Munroe cites Chernobyl as having 6 millisieverts/hour on average[4]. That&#x27;s 3000 times background radiation [2], or a 350-year wait before Chernobyl emits the same amount [5].<p>This is obviously a simplification, though. Plutonium isotopes were released too [0], which have a much longer half-life (thousands of years). It&#x27;s possible those small amounts of plutonium will emit enough radiation to make Chernobyl have noticeably higher radiation levels than the background dose for much longer.<p>A final caveat: I&#x27;m not an expert or even a devoted amateur. Your question just sparked my curiosity.  Although, this New York Times article [6] says scientists say it takes about 10-13 half lives for an area to recover, which is close to my 350 year figure.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/chernobyl/c02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.oecd-nea.org/rp/chernobyl/c02.html</a>.

That&#x27;s the first step. The second is to figure out a solution to the income inequality that opens so many doors for some, and keeps them closed for so many others.

This is the same like Enlightment Object System and GObject.<p>moreover drivers should be written in a DSl language (Termite-like) that supports concurrency and provided by spec writters as an appendix.<p>The driver is two parts. The OS adaptation Layer and a Formal description of modus Operandis.<p>Consider USB, normally the spec provides an implementtion i a DSL that &quot;compiles&quot; to the prose.<p>One can mechanically check for invariants and properties and\ncompile to an OS package.<p>I think it is possible. Packages for example could describe transports<p>e.g. module BT uses an Ocaml-like interface for transport that can have various implementations like USB transport.<p>But all could be written in the same DSL.<p>Of course Kernel developers are allergic to memory management. Rust/Ocaml/D are the anti-histamine.",1417158763

Regrettably that is rarely done, but could in principle be done regardless of the type system of the language.
