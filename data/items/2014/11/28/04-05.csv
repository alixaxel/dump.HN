8669733,comment,8669044,8669718,0,0,ori_b,,,"The Fukushima accident was a rare event, dumped a small amount of waste compared to ongoing industrial operations, and the most worrying part of the waste that it dumped decays on the timescale of decades, and not millenia.<p>I don&#x27;t have stats about what gets directly into the oceans, but when we mine gold, copper, and other ores, we create entire ponds called &quot;tailings ponds&quot; full of arsenic, cyanide, mercury, and all sorts of other nasty substances. These ponds leak into the environment on a regular basis. Short of seeping into the environment, many of these substances NEVER GO AWAY. THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM.<p>Nuclear waste comes in small quantities, in neat, easy to handle packages, and the most dangerous elements in it will decay relatively quickly. Over the entire lifetime of the nuclear industry, less than 80,000 tons of radioactive waste have been produced. Meanwhile, one mine alone produced 237,000 tons of arsenic trioxide over its lifetime. This substance is just sitting in the abandoned mine now.<p>The most worrying part of the nuclear waste story, to me, is that NIMBYism and fear has blocked attempts to produce permanent, safe facilities for permanent sequestration, so it&#x27;s stored almost as poorly as our super toxic tailings. At least there&#x27;s less of it, and efforts are made to clean it up when it gets into the environment.",1417150766

8669711,comment,8668680,8669323,0,0,belovedeagle,,,"> provably safe<p>There&#x27;s the thing.<p>The reason that some problems can simply be solved more efficiently (on current hardware architectures) in C than in other languages is that there&#x27;s a difference between what is &quot;provably safe&quot; and what is &quot;provably safe to a compiler&quot;. That&#x27;s the whole point of Rust&#x27;s unsafe{}; not to write code that&#x27;s actually unsafe on purpose, but to say, &quot;this code is safe, even though you can&#x27;t prove it&quot; (indeed, perhaps unsafe blocks ought to be renamed to safe blocks; that would also alleviate the problem of opposite meanings of unsafe blocks and unsafe functions).<p>That is to say, it&#x27;s not true that there are data structures impossible to write in a provably safe way without automatic GC, since whatever automatic GC can do the programmer can do too (although, admittedly, at some point one begins to blur the line between GC and manual freeing, such as with reference counting). It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s a lot easier for the <i>compiler</i> to prove that GC-managed code is safe.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that being forced to have the compiler prove that your code is safe rather than being able to say, &quot;no, I proved it myself with more advanced techniques&quot; is a good thing. Admittedly, most programs written today in so-called &quot;safe&quot; languages are probably beyond the scope of their programmers&#x27; abilities to prove safe, but then again, a lot of those programs turn out to be horribly unsafe even with the compiler&#x27;s help!",1417150169

These articles and even more the countless yoga ads with young beautiful ladies are really counterproductive from the viewpoint of yoga. They might be helpful from another perspective.<p>I can&#x27;t summarize the real goal of yoga properly (meditation is one of the important exercise beside contemplation; the asanas are for preparation only), but it&#x27;s more to be able to let go of the selfish desires like becoming smarter, getting a sexier body, getting more money, fame, admiring (&quot;Oh, you look so good lately&quot; ... &quot;Yes, you know, I&#x27;m doing yoga.&quot;). The goal is more to be able to coordinate (not suppress) the desires to avoid doing harm and at the end creating harm for yourself. Meditation gives us insight to where the desires are coming from. Are they essential? Do I need to fullfil them? Or do I need to eat another snickers just because the last one has made my blood sugar go like a rollercoaster?",1417150067

For example, a business that derives the majority of its customer referrals from paid search doesn&#x27;t necessarily have a valid reason to diversify if it has the ROI equation down and understands and manages the associated risks.<p>The real problem with social media channels like Facebook is that many folks have been treating them (and investing in them) as if they were &quot;owned media&quot; when they never have been and never will be. These people are just figuring out that these channels fall under the categories of &quot;earned media&quot; and &quot;paid media&quot; now that Facebook et. al. are turning the screws. The true tragedy of this is that many of these unsophisticated marketers will have little to nothing to show for their social investments when all is said and done.

Many businesses fail because they focus simply on payroll and payroll taxes, and neglect to consider the entire actual cost required to enable an employee to perform the work he or she was hired to do.\nFully burdened costs for individual employees can be expressed as a yearly total to provide an estimate of how much the company will spend that year on an employee. It can also be expressed as an hourly cost by dividing the total yearly cost by the number of hours the employee will work. This number is often 50% to 150% higher than the gross hourly wage. As costs are often used as the basis for pricing services or products, this is why it is so critical to obtain an in-depth understanding of the true cost of an employee.</i><p>And some more <a href=""http://www.sleeter.com/supplemental/articles/Labor_Burden_Gilson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sleeter.com/supplemental/articles/Labor_Burden_Gi...</a><p><i>edit</i><p>Actually, I have an old &quot;new employee, this is what you cost us&quot; sheet a firm gave me a while ago when I worked for them.

I think one time I saw the figure and it was something like $260k/yr/employee and there was lots of distress over that being about $20k too high.<p>The flip side is that we charged out for around $300k-$600k/yr depending on the job.",1417148678

However, there are still a point that could use clarification.<p>> During a routine test on April 26, 1986, reactor Number 4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant experienced a power surge that triggered an emergency shutdown. It did not work.<p>Calling the incident a <i>routine test</i> greatly mischaracterizes what they were doing. This wasn&#x27;t some sort of daily safety checklist test nor a safety margin test, this was a full-blown <i>experiment</i>. Yes, like a science lab experiment, but with a fully fueled commercial RBMK reactor. This is important because the author falsely makes <i>routine</i> nuclear powerplant operation seem unsafe.<p>To properly characterize the experiment on fair grounds it is nice to mention that the experiment they wanted to test is started by carrying out a simulated emergency shutdown. This is huge. You don&#x27;t call an emergency shutdown of a gigantic plutonium-making-machine &quot;routine&quot; (Note: RBMKs have a thermal power output on the high side). However, the bigger problem was that the authorities running this experiment treated it exactly the same way the author did.<p>If the authorities did care, they would have properly trained the night shift personnel with the experiment (or delayed the experiment altogether). The fact that the experiment continued with the night shift that was poorly trained for the experiment operations points to a &quot;this is routine and should not be a big deal&quot; vibe of whoever was in charge. I dislike how nowadays others (such as the the author) looking into the reactor accident keep espousing this giant red flag.",1417148340

Particularly when that source (Facebook) has goals (generate revenue/profit) that do not align with yours (free marketing).<p>I&#x27;ve also come to accept and even appreciate that access to users is something worth paying for. Getting users is hard. Damn hard. Sometimes that access is a rev share and sometimes it&#x27;s an advertising fee. That&#x27;s fine. A mere 15 years ago you couldn&#x27;t pay that fee to access a user pool that large if you wanted to.",1417147487

If I like a page, I want to see the information from that page, if I didn&#x27;t I would remove them from my feed.<p>It&#x27;s this kind of mismanagement of information I am subscribing to that will surely have people looking elsewhere.<p>Will Facebook soon filter out friend requests from people they don&#x27;t see as being suitable?",1417147380

But it turns out it&#x27;s very hard to make F2P profitable, so now they want to move to a subscription/recurring revenue model.

8669593,comment,8668680,8668680,0,0,Animats,,,"Some of the unhappiness stems from C++, which was supposed to &quot;fix C&quot;. Instead, it created a big mess. C++ is the only major language to support hiding (&quot;abstraction&quot;) without memory safety. This turned out to be a poor feature combination, never again repeated. C has neither hiding nor memory safety, so if it&#x27;s broken, at least it&#x27;s visible at the user program level. Java/Pascal/Modula/Ada/Common LISP/Go/Rust, and the interpretive &quot;scripting languages&quot;, all have both hiding and memory safety.  We&#x27;ve at least come to an agreement on that feature set.<p>Because of the existence of C++, mainstream C language development more or less stopped.  ANSI C, ISO C, C99, and C11 don&#x27;t differ by much.<p>(At one time, I was promoting an approach to make C memory-safe in a way that allowed mixing safe and unsafe modules to allow a gradual transition and rewriting of old code.
