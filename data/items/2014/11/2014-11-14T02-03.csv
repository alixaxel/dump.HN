8605607,comment,8600716,8602286,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Not entirely sure why I got downvoted. I guess people don&#x27;t like HR teams.<p>A great HR team?<p>Showing up on your first day and having everything you need. A laptop that does what it needs, a pass, someone to induct you, materials that get you started. Making you feel welcome. Being productive and part of the team. Sure, your manager and team are part of that, but HR facilities this (In most cases, teams are woeful at doing this).<p>A great office environment. Making sure people have the right skills. And not just technical - managerial skills and support. Encouraging teams and cross-functional discussion.<p>Coaching hiring managers on the best ways to interview. Making sure people are greeted properly. Interviews are kept. Presenting an employee brand that makes people want to work at the company.<p>Having a performance review system that doesn&#x27;t suck and gives people the feedback they need to get better. Sure, people hate then, but people also crave feedback.<p>An office environment that suits the culture and makes people productive. Making sure people are getting the emotional support they need.<p>Ever had a co-worker who&#x27;s depressed, suicidal? Someone that has committed suicide. Or a death in the company? Someone that has a family tragedy? Organizing counseling for the team? HR steps up. It&#x27;s easy to brush over these things until they happen. You appreciate a professional when it does.<p>Ever needed someone walked off the premises because they are threatening? Sexual harassment? Health and safety violations. Easy to say, meh, these aren&#x27;t important – but, no, they are. Blocked fire exits kill people. Toxic cultures sink companies.<p>.. And yes. Making sure people get paid. That the health insurance works.<p>There are plenty of examples where this <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work. There are plenty of sucky implementations. Performance reviews generally suck. But I can assure that the growth tech companies wanting to kick goals <i>are</i> getting these things right.",1415933987

It is an absolute abomination.  It left behind the power of notation as a tool for thought and turnd the concept of APL into a pile of giberish on a page.<p><a href=""http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pd...</a>
Where are APL and J? For the most part, dead.  Sure there are people using them.  If someone like me who used the language almost exclusively for ten years hasn&#x27;t touched it for two decades I think it is safe to say: Great language to learn.  Powerful and fantastic concepts.  But, no thanks.  Happy with C, C++ and Python.<p>The failure to open source a good APL didn&#x27;t help either.<p>If J-Software wants to make a last valiant effort to bring this back my opinion is simple: Read the paper linked above and go back to the roots.  Extend the language to make it object oriented and create interfaces to C, C++ and Python.  That&#x27;s a start.  I could write a paper on how to improve APL.  It has to start with a commitment to moving software engineering into the realm of communicating through notation rather than cryptic text.",1415933969

We have a setup that consists of a domain hosted on GoDaddy in which we have forwarding to a www subdomain which is a CNAME that points to another domain.
So it&#x27;s like this foobar.com forwards to www.foobar.com and www.foobar.com points to baz.com via a CNAME.
If a URL exists such as foobar.com/some%3Aelse GoDaddy will fail in forwarding it and respond with... < HTTP/1.1 302 Found < Cache-Control: max-age=900 < Location: /site.aspx?aspxerrorpath=/some:else
After numerous calls to GoDaddy tier 1 and tier 2 tech support they have come to the conclusion that it can&#x27;t be fixed and that we should look elsewhere for a service that fulfills our needs.
