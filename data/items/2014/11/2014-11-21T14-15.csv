8641510,comment,8637365,8640391,0,0,opinali,,,"You speak of &quot;free market&quot; but we&#x27;re not in the 18th century anymore; advertising is a foundation of modern capitalism, as much as (for example) banks and the whole financial system. The economy is full of &quot;overheads&quot; that you can hate if you only look at their downsides: when you buy some product you are also paying baked-in fees for credit card processing, subsidies for agriculture or fuel used in transportation, and many other things. Yet we put up with the banks, taxes, government regulations, and yes advertising too, because all these things have a net positive effect. Speaking of banks for example, we all hate banks but let&#x27;s be honest and tell me if you could hope to buy a house without a loan: most people would need to first save money for decades, which very few people have the discipline to do, or the resources to do as they simultaneously have to pay rent. So the mortgage system is clearly better, it enabled way more people to afford buying houses and in time this improves the market for everybody via economies of scale etc. (well, for 99% of us anyway).",1416581913

The less public value the leak has, and the more confidential the information is, the more damage it can cause, the more carefully it needs to be handled.<p>If a leak is very confidential but has a lot of value, using it is ok; the Pentagon Papers, for example. If a leak is not particularly confidential, has some public value, using it is ok; the name of the new store that&#x27;s coming to a neighborhood, for instance. The first two items I was able to find for other expressions of the line of thought are the &quot;Clandestine methods: Principles&quot; section at [1] and this article [2].<p>The Business Insider article doesn&#x27;t present any reason for choosing to publish the Uber information. It doesn&#x27;t even offer any interesting analysis of it. It just seems to be revealing it for the sake of revealing it. There are ways to use the data that might be justified — for instance, discussing the risks of the company&#x27;s legal status being uncertain in some of it&#x27;s largest markets; looking at the number of drivers it has and the net effects of that on the total number of cars on the streets; looking at general trends in growth without revealing details, if they&#x27;re interesting. Simply presenting the information raw and without context isn&#x27;t reporting, though; it&#x27;s just sharing, and, in this case, it&#x27;s sharing information that wasn&#x27;t meant to be shared, so it seems sleazy.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/reporting-to-canadians/acts-and-policies/programming/journalism/investigative-journalism/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/reporting-to-canadians/act...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/ethicalperspectives/leaks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/ethicalperspectives/l...</a>",1416580918

    -- Boehm-Berarducci encoding

Roughly, the first encoding gives you pattern matching, and the second gives you foldr (reduce).

In Emacs, I NEVER remember things consciously; I keep using something until it is recalled effortlessly. On the other hand, it&#x27;s not like you don&#x27;t have to remember things with those fancy GUIs. Take Eclipse as an example. You would have to steps through meaningless GUIs to configure something to work, and you have to remember those steps mechanically the next time you setup something. I would rather learn a consistent programming language with actual easy to remember rules to first configure simple things, and later extend my editor, rather than stepping through those meaningless GUIs.<p>And what you said that most of the stuff that are easily achievable with a mouse, try to do equivalent things like this in SECONDS: <a href=""http://emacsrocks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emacsrocks.com/</a>. Well, that&#x27;s why my co-workers work so hard why I have time to enjoy other things during my daily work.<p>What you said, like many other people who didn&#x27;t learn Emacs properly or left it for so long that don&#x27;t know what Emacs is currently capable of, is seriously outdated.<p>You should have a look at my post in this thread: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8639804"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8639804</a> to see what Emacs is capable of that I could never find in any other editors, and even IDEs.",1416580190

I read every day on hacker news; copyright laws are wrong, too long, not fair... I do not see it the same way. The hacker news community is a community who creates many things themselves; many of the community has chosen the path to give open licenses to their creation. This is their right and thankfully they do it. But. All things are not equal; while i think the giving open licenses to software benefits everyone. I do not see mandating open licenses and wide use of &quot;The Arts&quot; to do the same.<p>Creation needs to be a struggle. Taking someone else thing and modifying it is an easy path to create something. It also damages the original creation. Software and Art are NOT the same thing. Because software industry has chosen a different path should not mandate everything do the same.<p>Taking the collection of Marvel comic&#x27;s characters and Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; and creating a movie would also be cool, but it damages the original. It also by-passes the true meaning of greatness; Original. We as a society have in the last few decades valued bullshit Art over copyright and originality. Why? because it is easy and gives a short amount of pleasure.<p>Great things to not need marketing. Tolkien does not need marketing. He and his family (example) should be compensated forever. there should be no termination to it and his family should profit from it forever.<p>We should never take away the rights of the people who create things.

After all even the JVM must resolve method calls at every method invocation instead of getting them resolved at compile/link time. Rubinius tries to do some magic there but it&#x27;s still in line with MRI performances (a little slower actually). Based on the benchmarks I saw for JRuby vs MRI I&#x27;d say that only long running programs will get sped up, but after all who cares about interactive programs completing in 1 or in 0.01 s?
