8648042,comment,8646388,8647417,0,0,chipsy,,,"The capacity of mass transit modes is still worthwhile even in a fully automated universe, once you get dense enough. It&#x27;s a simple calculation of space usage: If you fit more people in a vehicle, you use less road. Depending on mode and scale, you may save energy too.<p>Now, you could postulate that we&#x27;ll go smaller with AVs, or we&#x27;ll develop ways to reconfigure vehicles on demand to synthesize a larger vehicle. But those things are not as clearly on the horizon as an immediate post-AV situation where traffic patterns remain roughly the same(ease of trips encourages more trips per day, cancelling efficiencies), but per-vehicle usage rates are up(due to better sharing). In that situation, we get better safety and convenience, and future zoning will require less parking...i.e. you get a global spike in density, which motivates better transit.",1416725893

Honestly this kind of crap is like doing grade school all over again. Grow up already, does windows support webm/webp natively? Nope, needs plugins.<p>Webp is in a lot of the same boat as webm legally. It may be &quot;open&quot;, whatever the fuck that means anymore, but that doesn&#x27;t make it patent free or not needing of any licensing concerns.

8648030,comment,8645607,8646481,0,0,robocat,,,"I would encourage our competitors to only support modern browsers and encourage them to use pure feature detection: because their solution will work poorly, or just not work at all (about 20% of our users are on IE8).<p>User-agent sniffing is a necessary evil, even with careful use of feature detection. I use pure JavaScript rendering on the client side, and feature detection is not enough.<p>Feature detection cannot detect many browser quirks: quirks with <input> elements; quirks with viewports; quirks with keyboards; quirks with focusing; quirks with display:fixed etc.<p>Examples
 * We detect Samsung phones because you can&#x27;t type a decimal place into a numeric input on a Samsung. Users need to input decimal numbers fast (show numeric keyboard on focus) but we show the alpha-numeric keyboard to Samsung phones.
 * Android Chrome doesn&#x27;t tell you if the backspace key was pressed (or what key was pressed in general, for good design reasons).
 * Firefox has event quirks when the Escape key is pressed in an input.
 * Webkit has quirks with selecting text and focus.
 * IE10 (Metro mode only) displays borders wierdly with disabled inputs<p>I admit that browser sniffing is a bad code smell. Most times a better solution exists that doesn&#x27;t need sniffing or the design changed to avoid the problem... But it is not always possible (e.g. some keyboard bugs), not always desirable (e.g. critical high-usage areas that we don&#x27;t wish to compromise), or not always practical (I don&#x27;t always have the time free that it takes to discover the &quot;perfect&quot; solution).<p>Fundamentally, we try not to tell our customers what browser they &quot;should&quot; use. When they ask &quot;we use X, will your solution work&quot; we try to be able to say yes even if it is makes us work harder... X was IE6 a few years ago (competitor developers couldn&#x27;t hack it), or X could be Android, or iOS4 on iPad1, or Windows Mobile (large customer happy to hear that we had app in mobile store).",1416725374

8648021,comment,8646787,8647054,0,0,tempestn,,,"My understanding is that peak power availability is at least as important as total energy storage.  (The main use of grid storage is to handle spikes in usage, or similarly to fill in for dips in generation - like from wind turbines.  Either way, peak power available is important.)  One big weight would give you significantly more peak power than several smaller ones.  Yes it would require more or stronger cables, motors, and other infrastructure, but the cost of all those is small compared to the shaft, so I imagine a single weight would maximize peak power / cost.",1416724748

The real question is why they aren&#x27;t <i>more overrepresented</i> in leadership. It&#x27;s a valid question, but a different one than I was asking.<p>Apriori I would not expect the demographics of leadership to look like those of tech. My simple model (with allusions to michaelochurch) is that tech is generally not the path to leadership. I.e., if 3% of techies go into leadership vs 5% of non-techies, then leadership demographics will look more like non-tech demographics than tech demographics.",1416724419
8648014,comment,8647686,8647936,0,0,tzs,,,"MIT and Stanford both use race as a significant factor in making admission decisions. They have explicitly stated this [1]. Caltech much less so (I believe it can be used as a tie breaker). Hence, Caltech is a better control than Stanford or MIT to compare against when you are trying to see what things should look like if race were not a factor.<p>It&#x27;s not a perfect control, though, because of Caltech&#x27;s focus on STEM. Caltech does actually offer non-STEM courses (and majors). In fact, it requires students to take about 1/4 of their coursework in humanities and social sciences, which is similar to what a science major at a good liberal arts school would take. Nevertheless, no one chooses Caltech for the humanities or social sciences, whereas people DO choose Harvard for them.<p>Although undergraduates are generally not admitted on a department by department basis, surely the schools have to try to get some idea from the application what fields the student is interested in majoring in, and they have to take that into account in making their decisions. If you have facilities for 50 new chemistry majors a year and 50 new English Literature majors a yer, and you get 500 applicants from people whose application suggests they might go into chemistry and only 60 applicants who appear likely to go into English Lit, you are going to reject a lot of those potential chemistry majors, even if their applications look better (grades, tests, and so on) than those of many of the people you accept from the group that looks interested in English Lit.<p>Since many high achieving Asians are driven by pressure from their parents, and parents push their kids toward STEM a lot more often than they push toward English Literature, it is possible that Asians could be getting effectively discriminated against as a side effect of them concentrating in STEM.<p>[1] <a href=""http://findlawimages.com/efile/supreme/briefs/02-241/02-241.mer.ami.mit.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://findlawimages.com/efile/supreme/briefs/02-241/02-241....</a>",1416724392

Most 1st generation Asian immigrants are students who come to the U.S. for grad school. They (and their children) are better at STEM simply because they (or their parents) are/were grad students in that area. As an Asian, I saw lots of students who are not good at STEM and simply did not get an offer from any U.S. university. The immigration policy and universities&#x27; admission procedure are intentionally designed to select foreign students who are good in those majors.",1416722952

    foldr f = go
      where
        go z (x:xs) = f x (go z xs)
        go z []     = z
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s better written with the cases for <i>go</i> reversed, so the base case comes first, or without the helper function at all, as<p><pre><code>    foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b
    foldr f z [] = z
    foldr f z (x:xs) = f x (foldr z xs)
</code></pre>
But I suppose that if you&#x27;re reading this then you already knew that. I&#x27;m really writing because I noticed that this submission, like another submission that made the front page of HN twice in the past two days [0], touches on the same material as Ch. 6 of Richard Bird and Philip Wadler&#x27;s book <i>Introduction to Functional Programming</i> [1], which I happened to be re-reading a couple of nights ago. And I want to tell you to go read it.<p>Really, if you find this sort of thing interesting, you should read it. The book isn&#x27;t strictly a Haskell book—it was published in 1988, just as Haskell&#x27;s designers (the book&#x27;s authors among them) were getting going. But their book remains one of the best, most timeless introductions to programming in a lazy functional language. It&#x27;s written in a sort of functional pseudo-code (which Haskell aspires to be) and captures all of the excitement and optimism of the coming of age of functional programming in the years after Miranda.<p>Bird and Wadler&#x27;s book is quite different from standard contemporary recommendations like <i>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good</i>; it&#x27;s more like an extended version of John Hughes&#x27;s famous paper <i>Why Functional Programming Matters</i> [2], which is to say that it makes the case for functional programming over imperative programming and illustrates the strengths of lazy evaluation. The book continues on from the basics to discuss evaluation strategies, efficiency, and other practical mid-level topics in some depth, without breaking stride; it doesn&#x27;t touch much of the algebraic or categorical underpinnings of Haskell, which is the relative strength of an introduction like <i>Learn You</i>. That makes the two together a great one-two punch for learning Haskell.<p>0. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8645292"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8645292</a><p>1. <a href=""http://www.nlda-tw.nl/janmartin/vakken/TFIT/Extra%20materiaal/Bird_Wadler.%20Introduction%20to%20Functional%20Programming.1ed.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nlda-tw.nl/janmartin/vakken/TFIT/Extra%20materiaa...</a> [PDF]<p>2. <a href=""http://worrydream.com/refs/Hughes-WhyFunctionalProgrammingMatters.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/refs/Hughes-WhyFunctionalProgrammingMa...</a> [PDF]",1416722885

that didn&#x27;t sink plan9. what sank plan9 was that linux was there and was &quot;good enough&quot;, and that it took a full decade to realize that the concepts of plan9 can&#x27;t be backported to unix/linux piecemeal. that they fit much better together in a coherent system that didn&#x27;t carry the baggage of unix (the root user, for example). this is what the original plan9 papers were trying to say: it&#x27;s a rethinking, you have to cut the cord to eliminate the baggage. the baggage has proven sufficiently heavy that more than 20 years later you&#x27;re not seeing private namespaces in linux. instead you see fully virtualized instances of the operating system -- with all the baggage that they carry -- and most efforts are focused on making them work efficiently, rather than on inventing something truly original.<p>that said, if plan9 was open sourced in 1995 and had taken over, we wouldn&#x27;t be talking now about a linux behemoth bolting systemd onto itself, but a plan9 one. successful software grows itself into morbidity. plan9 would&#x27;ve been no different.",1416722858

There are groups of people who will be upset that they couldn&#x27;t get into a school because they were the &quot;wrong&quot; race. So you still have a racism problem at the end of the day; just a lesser-known version. This is where I prefer things like BlackGirlsCode.com to try and work on these issues <i>&quot;on the side&quot;[1]</i> to raise academic performance, so the school in the big public spotlight like Harvard don&#x27;t have to take sides in the controversy and just admit people based on scores, achievements, whatever... just not the controversial stuff like gender, race, etc.<p>_______<p>1. When I say &quot;on the side&quot;, I basically mean that probably nobody is going to be upset at BlackGirlsCode.com enough to actually file a lawsuit(and have a chance at winning) the way Harvard is getting sued now.
