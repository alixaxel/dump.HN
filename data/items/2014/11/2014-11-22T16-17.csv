Google thinks that&#x27;s a bummer and wants to fix it. However, they warn that the rendering changes required are so fundamental that it may be difficult for other vendors to match. Expect that to play out over a few years.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to know what those changes are. From what I can tell, you want off-main-thread layout because a lot of these properties require layout. But Google rejected off-main-thread layout as &quot;not helpful&quot;. Perhaps they&#x27;re referring to display lists (&quot;Blueprints&quot;), which can indeed be helpful, but Gecko already has them… (Granted, display list building in Gecko is not incremental yet, but that does not require &quot;fundamental&quot; rearchitecting.)",1416675480

In software development, tasks can be parcelled out in a modular way to many developers. But this model doesn&#x27;t work well for visual and interaction design. If you want all the parts of an Operating System or piece of software to feel consistent and cohesive, you need a more focused approach. And that means handing design tasks to a designated design team and entrusting them to make the UX decisions. But with open source projects, we all want a say in the UX (me included); thus the endless (and often bitter) discussions about how a piece of software should behave.<p>The model of open source code has influenced and inspired countless companies. But who can point to examples of visual and interaction design from open source software that has had a similar effect?

I know in Florida where I am, non-competes are very frowned upon in the legal system if they are too broad, overly prohibitive or for more than 2 years (in general). The key is an employer cannot prevent you from working in your field of expertise, and they cannot prevent you from using your knowledge to help others, except that they can hold you accountable not to disclose or utilize company specific knowledge.  That is sometimes hard to define, but usually is the secret sauce that makes something unique.

In fact, if a worker captures <i>all</i> of the value, there would be no benefit to the employer.<p>The point of the post is that we aren&#x27;t in a labor <i>bubble</i>, because the amount of value created by a programmer is much higher than the programmer&#x27;s salary.  For instance, suppose that a contractor installing marble countertops on luxury houses out in the desert gets paid 100k a year.  It turns out that the value of those countertops is below 100k a year.  This could be used to suggest that the jobs themselves will disappear (or salaries must drop dramatically), as the value they generate isn&#x27;t sufficient to justify that pay.<p>Now suppose installing those countertops generate 200k a year in value, but that it is relatively easy.  That would suggest that salaries could drop even though there is a surplus of value in the existing salary structure.  However, it wouldn&#x27;t suggest that salaries need to drop because value generated isn&#x27;t sufficient to justify the pay level.<p>I think that&#x27;s the point here - that the amount of value generated is so great that programmer salaries could remain high.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean then <i>will</i>, just that we aren&#x27;t in a salary bubble where salaries are higher than value generated.",1416674260

CEO&#x27;s are paid ridiculous amounts because the perception is almost no one can do the job. Janitors are paid little because the perception is almost anyone can do the job. The result of this is that many buildings are cleaned poorly, so nxt time you see a dirty bathroom, don&#x27;t blame the janitor, blame the person hiring the janitor. The supply of good janitors is much more restricted than it appears, but that&#x27;s because the person hiring typically can&#x27;t see the value in paying more.<p>For programmers it&#x27;s the same. Good programmers can make or break a business by building software which sells itself, or by building software with 10 times less effort, turning loss into profit, but many people hiring the programmers don&#x27;t see it that way, so many programming jobs underpay, and many people paid to program have no business being anywhere near a keyboard.",1416674237

The reality was technical leadership stopped a level below director, and only 2 or 3 even managed to make it that far.  After 3.5 years there, it had a formative impact of pushing me away from both the company and technology.  I recovered on both, but it&#x27;s something one should take seriously on taking a job.  I&#x27;m not sure that creating &quot;Mega-consultants&quot; works either, as it takes the emphasis away from delivery ownership.<p>That said, here are a few ideas in rank order from easy/feasible to crazy/radical:<p>1)  Technical leaders of a certain level can not be overruled on technical decisions by non-technical leaders in the department.<p>2)  Encourage the best to share their work outside the firm.<p>3)  Smart people like to be with smart people.  Pay up for a culture or cohort of superstars, not an individual superstar.<p>4)  Provide time and monetary budget for architecture and technical debt that is owned and allocated by the best in the organization.<p>5)  Allow technical stars to have the ability to change assignments at their will with a given notice period.  (Yes it may cause problems, but the free market is always giving them offers)<p>6)  Enable managers to raise technical pay without concern for bands.  For example, the VP should be able to say, &quot;I can hire 4 engineers for 100K each, or I can hire someone in the open market for 200K.  Instead I will pay my internal superstar 220K since she will do it the best, even though it&#x27;s way out of bands of someone with her seniority and level.&quot;",1416674003

(I caveat this just because there are many such ideas which have different characteristics, but it&#x27;s not exactly what the JS community means by the term, for instance.)<p>You <i>should</i> return a chan. In this case, all crawlers should be returning along the same chan, errors or results, rather than creating one per request. Then you A: don&#x27;t have a problem where you could be processing result #5 but result #3 is blocking right now, increasing the total latency, B: having multiple consumers using the same channel is trivial and at the user&#x27;s discretion, and C: the resulting chan can participate in a &quot;select&quot; of the user&#x27;s choosing, unlike a function call. There is no way in which using this approach is superior to using a chan.<p>If you look at the wikipedia page for &quot;futures&quot;, which has a lot more than just any one community&#x27;s idea of &quot;futures&quot; in it, you can see that a channel that you expect to read one value from is, if not necessarily exactly any one of the given definitions, certainly a family member. It isn&#x27;t in the type system, but it is still the case that if you have a need for a &quot;future&quot; in Go you&#x27;re better off with a chan with that constraint documented, rather than returning a function that can be called, because of the inability to select on such a function. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises</a>",1416673093

8645803,comment,8645443,8645443,0,0,jocmeh,,,"I started using FreeBSD (version 4.8 at the time) in 2003 and I began a switch to Ubuntu in around 2011.<p>Disclaimer: the following is all very opinionated and 8.1 is the last version of FreeBSD I actively used. Actually, it&#x27;s still running without any problems on a colocated machine, but it&#x27;s a bit a &quot;don&#x27;t touch it&quot; situation, because upgrading even a single piece of software would probably cause a cataclysm of struggle. So I don&#x27;t touch it (except for the occasional move of something to an Ubuntu vps), but it works like a charm.
I&#x27;ve tried version 10 in a virtual machine because it had a new installer, but it was not the best experience ever (FreeBSD&#x27;s x.0 versions have always been better to skip, the x.1s were fine though). FreeBSD really needed a new installer and they did some great work, but it did not yet feel very solid. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve had to restart the Ubuntu installer often enough as well and I have a love/hate relationship with both of them.<p>Okay, let&#x27;s hit it.<p>FreeBSD: it&#x27;s clean, it&#x27;s minimal. It&#x27;s very good for learning *NIX stuff because you will have to do a lot of configuration yourself. What they do is very well done and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s hard to break it. Jails are very cool (OS level virtualization), but like everything else in the FreeBSD world, it&#x27;s quite some work to maintain. If it runs, it runs and will keep on running basically forever. If you want to upgrade stuff, brace, brace. The ports tree was amazing back in the day, but has been overtaken by stuff like apt-get. Installation of bash used to be like this: cd /usr/ports/shells/bash && make install clean. And then, depending on your hardware and de ports dependencies, minutes or hours of waiting on the compilation. You can upgrade your base to any version without having to fear. You fetch a specific version, compile all the things (again, that is a lot of waiting), run mergemaster to fix up your configurations, reboot and you&#x27;re back.
FreeBSD isn&#x27;t very cutting edge on the level of hardware support, but it comes with OpenBSD packet filter which is the best firewall ever, it&#x27;s very powerful yet easy to setup. Also, the zfs support is awesome. That file system is truly amazing, very flexible and serious about data integrity. It&#x27;s cool until it breaks though, &#x27;cause you&#x27;ll be diving deep in obscure Solaris documentation and just praying to get your data back. But, I had zfs on an external USB drive and you just shouldn&#x27;t do that. With built-in drives you&#x27;ll probably be very safe with zfs.
To sum it up: if you&#x27;re patient, care about technology and have a lot of time, FreeBSD is truly a marvellous operating system that will never let you down. It&#x27;s solid stuff and it&#x27;s serious, but it is an investment.<p>Ubuntu: as someone who started with FreeBSD, Linux always felt a bit messy to me. We, the FreeBSD users at the time, used to make fun of Linux guys saying they have scripts for everything. And in some way I still think that&#x27;s true. ;) The scripts in init.d very often have &#x27;issues&#x27;. Ubuntu does a lot of stuff for you automatically. Installation of software couldn&#x27;t be much easier and many times there&#x27;s not much to configure. A &#x27;disadvantage&#x27; is that you don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time figuring out how the software does and what all it&#x27;s options are, it just works. The way configuration files are organised is pretty neat, with almost everything in it&#x27;s own dir in /etc/ and foo.d dirs for adding extra options in small config files. (This is very contrary to FreeBSD, where you have one big /etc/rc.conf to configure the stuff that starts when booting and where you can define extra parameters for the software. There&#x27;s /etc/ for configuring the base system and /usr/local/etc/ for placing files for software that&#x27;s not in base.) When you&#x27;re used to pf, iptables is just shit (but ufw helps a lot). It&#x27;s such a struggle to configure.<p>So why did I switch from FreeBSD to Ubuntu? Reason number one is because the place where I started working had done that. I really loved FreeBSD and I didn&#x27;t really had that feeling towards Linux, but using Linux in day to day life is just a lot easier. It&#x27;s more common, most people use Linux so you don&#x27;t have to do &#x27;BSD specific stuff&#x27;. Also, I loved doing all the configuration stuff years back, but I know how it&#x27;s done now and I mostly just want my stuff to work without spending hours on configuration and maintenance. You can do that with one FreeBSD server without any problem, but when you have to manage around 50 servers, it becomes quite a thing. Installing a new kernel on an Ubuntu server or upgrading software is super easy and you don&#x27;t have to wait for hours because you don&#x27;t have to compile all the stuff.<p>To conclude, I&#x27;d say: just give FreeBSD a try, it&#x27;s never a bad idea to have a look at what others do. I just wouldn&#x27;t advise rolling it out to lots of servers, unless you have a very specific reason to do so.",1416672016
