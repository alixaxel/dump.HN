We would also need a way to verify client code to ensure that malicious changes haven&#x27;t been introduced. And finally, we would need a way to anonymize all requests to the backend.<p>An architecture like this is pretty hard to implement, so it would be nice if we could just get the NSA to stop.",1416362370

Giving people free stuff has never worked in the history of the world.

8627734,comment,8626928,8627359,0,0,barrkel,,,"Zfs sector size (ashift parameter) is set at vdev creation time. That is, when you get a bunch of drives together, and you want to have some redundancy or striping, you create a vdev that is composed of several drives, for your desired mode of redundancy (and / or striping). A pool is composed of multiple vdevs; zfs file systems all allocate from a common pool. So it&#x27;s generally only a problem if you are replacing an existing drive in a vdev after it failed.<p>Zfs doesn&#x27;t support a bunch of things. It has no defragmentation. Filling a zfs pool much north of 90% tends to kill its performance even after you delete stuff to bring it back down again. The usual answer to these things is &quot;wipe the pool and restore from a backup&quot;, or &quot;zfs send <snapshot> | zfs receive <filesystem>&quot;. The answer to changing the sector size of a vdev is similar, just like it is for removing a disk from a vdev, or reconfiguring your redundancy in most cases.<p>This is just how zfs is currently implemented. It was designed for Sun&#x27;s customers, for whom having backup for the whole pool, or having a whole second pool to stream to, is not a big deal.

This is just the SK government trying to get prepared for the economic shock of having to absorb NK on short notice, which could happen at any time this century.<p>SK is also sending a message to the international society that we should all prepare for the collapse of NK, while sending a message to Kim Jong Un that &quot;you won&#x27;t last long, and we know it.&quot;<p>Just today, the UN General Assembly approved a resolution to refer NK leaders to the International Criminal Court for human rights violations. Totally unrealistic, to be honest, but I guess this is how political pressure works on the world stage. Timing the &quot;we&#x27;ll spend $0.5T&quot; press release to coincide with the UN resolution is no doubt intended to increase pressure on NK -- if not directly, then at least indirectly by letting the people of NK know that $0.5T is waiting for them if they can get rid of their Dear Leader.

Rather than make up nonsense to try to dismiss what I said, if you feel you can not respond without further embarrassing yourself then simply opt not to.  The fact that you have yet to answer my very simple direct question, and instead want to try to weasel more FUD against free software in is quite telling.  But now I have a new question.  Since BSD licensed code is so bad for society, I assume you don&#x27;t use openssh, or X Windows, or apache, or nginx, or any of the other massively important BSD licensed software millions of people benefit from?<p>>I suggest reading the FSF&#x27;s explanation of why the GPL exists.<p>I suggest you try to be less condescending when trying to convince people to buy into your lies.<p>>The right to keep other people from using and modifying software is, by contrast, not a legitimate freedom.<p>Words have meaning.  They still have the meaning even if you do not like it.  Freedom means freedom.  Not &quot;only freedoms I approve of&quot;.  Your statement is every bit as absurd as people claiming the freedom to prevent others from entering your home is not a &quot;legitimate freedom&quot;.<p>>The GPL attempts to disarm such attack routes by requiring you to pass on, to all subsequent downstream users, the same right to use and modify the software that you yourself received<p>No, it passes down an obligation, not a right.  Not a freedom.<p>>The BSD license by contrast, allows you to sue downstream users who modify the software for copyright infringement<p>No, the BSD license does not prevent you from suing people who modify <i>your</i> code.  You have no ability to sue people for modifying the BSD licensed code.  You are resorting to the oldest and most obviously incorrect FUD technique, one which even RMS has requested GPL fanatics refrain from repeating.  My code that uses BSD licensed code is not the BSD licensed code I used.  Nothing done to my code has any effect on the BSD licensed code.  It can not be &quot;made closed&quot; or any such nonsense.<p>>But because it&#x27;s BSD-licensed, Apple can prohibit me from distributing modified versions of OSX, and can invoke the DMCA to prevent me from reverse-engineering it in certain ways.<p>That would still be true if they did not use BSD licensed code.  That&#x27;s the point.  Nothing is lost here.  The only thing that changed is instead of apple writing code, they used existing code which due to age and examination is almost certainly of higher quality than anything apple could have produced in such a short time span.  So users of apple software got better software, and nobody lost out on anything.  Hardly seems a negative to society.<p>>That&#x27;s a &quot;freedom&quot; the BSD license allows Apple to retain, to use the power of the state to restrict my freedom.<p>Apple is not restricting your freedom.  The government is, via copyright law.  You feel so entitled to other people&#x27;s work that you conflate &quot;someone did not grant me additional rights above and beyond those I already have&quot; with &quot;someone is restricting my freedom&quot;.",1416359260
