A shirt would be essentially worth the food required during the time it took you or the village weaver/tailor to make it. Fine clothes, such as those worn by nobles were notoriously expensive, often with a person&#x27;s wardrobe being worth half of their entire estate (including land and buildings).<p>&quot;which requires precious natural resources...&quot; Many resources were more bountiful at the time, with more open areas and less population. Commons and wilderness closer by gave resources for the time to gather them.<p>&quot;and time to create...&quot; People had more time, without modern leisure pursuits. When you eat the subsistence level, you spend whatever time it takes to meet your needs (food, shelter, fuel, clothing).<p>But all these details were dependent on the time and place you&#x27;re interested in. Feudal Europe had peasants living in squalor while the nobles controlled the land/resources and got rich off peasant labor. In places like the Pacific Northwest of North America, the salmon run was so abundant and nutritious that food was not lacking and I imagine people had time to hunt for furs and sew them into clothing before winter, as well as develop other arts and crafts.",1415332509

It&#x27;s known that most ad clicks from about 10% of human users, who will click on anything but buy little.<p>The real winner in this is Amazon. Amazon doesn&#x27;t pay anybody when someone clicks on a product listing.  They have to buy.  Same for eBay.  So there&#x27;s no point in &#x27;bots clicking on those sites.<p>Online ad rates have been dropping for some time now.  Most of the ads run by Google Adsense (the ones on third party sites) are there because Google pushes advertisers hard to use that feature.  Most of the conversions from Google Ads come from the ones on search results, which are displayed when the user is looking for something.  Those are useful.  Most other forms of advertising are interruptions for users interested in something else.<p>The classic tactic ad-based companies try as ad prices drop is increasing the ad density.  That&#x27;s called &quot;pulling a Myspace&quot;.  It didn&#x27;t work for Myspace, which tanked.
