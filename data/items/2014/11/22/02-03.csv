Eventually Atari and Commodore won the home computer wars with cheaper systems that got upgraded ala cart.

8644542,comment,8644067,8644356,0,0,btown,,,"It&#x27;s definitely an interesting question. Games like WoW can be excellent simulations of how to maintain morale in high-stress situations, which is basically what management in the startup world is all about. As a guild leader, you&#x27;re thrown into the fire of needing to balance a personal touch and sensitivity for each individual team member&#x27;s needs, against the general goals of the organization. And it&#x27;s a situation where a growing leader can try different leadership styles and see what works without causing a real-life organization to sink into the ground. Worst case, some people are disappointed, but everyone picks up the pieces.<p>You learn to use analytics tools (like worldoflogs.com which creates performance graphs based on raid event data) to be able to go up to people and say &quot;hey, I think you can improve by trying X&quot; without making things personal... much like agile startups use data-driven approaches (&quot;velocity&quot; and other metrics) to compartmentalize interpersonal relationships and team performance. With loot distribution, you learn that transparency and trust are key, and that you can set yourself apart in the community as an organization people want to be associated with. You learn how to recruit, how to hire, and even how to fire. And you learn to overcome the stress of making mistakes.<p>That all said, in order to be at the level where you&#x27;re leading and learning these lessons as a leader and not a follower, the time sink is necessarily huge. Is the benefit worth the reward? Not for people who already have opportunities to get this experience in &quot;meatspace.&quot; But I&#x27;d like to think that as technology improves, coding becomes widespread... people who are educated on leadership with the next generation of MMOs will naturally shift towards starting their own startups, and they&#x27;ll be more successful because of their MMO experience. It&#x27;s a scalable education system, and as other posters commented, everyone needs fun.<p>WoW, of course, is optimized for addictiveness, not optimized for teaching these lessons in the shortest amount of time possible. I never played America&#x27;s Army, nor have I done much research on it, but it seems like at its best moments it became such a leadership training environment. There&#x27;s a lot of room for exploration of this space.<p>Further works:<p><a href=""http://www.academia.edu/1317272/Leadership_Style_in_World_of_Warcraft_Raid_Guilds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.academia.edu/1317272/Leadership_Style_in_World_of...</a> - plots a spectrum of leadership styles and how different guilds display those traits<p><a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2009-01-14/how-world-of-warcraft-promotes-innovationbusinessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2009-01-14/how-world-of-...</a> - a bit of a stretch, but has some interesting ideas",1416624934

It has somehow become for-profit corporations&#x27; God-given right to expect free labor from white-collar professionals.  Ahem, <i>what</i>?<p>I have gotten asked about whether I&#x27;d OSS my services if I was unable to continue maintaining them commercially.  Nope.  Not a chance.  If they need a soft landing, that soft landing will be a 6 month warning to get your data out, prior to them going into the big bit bucket in the sky.  It is <i>extraordinarily difficult</i> to take a multi-tenant SaaS app and turn it into a single-tenant appliance.  There are people who do <i>exactly that</i> as a consulting service, and they charge tens of thousands of dollars for it, for a reason.  (Plug: take a look at jidoteki.com, which is attempting to productize that particular space.)<p>Just doing the license review is something that they pay serious professionals with high-three-figures-an-hour bill rates to walk on a file-by-file and function-by-function basis in the case of e.g. an acquisition.  If a forgotten subsystem got written by a freelancer 4 years ago and you don&#x27;t have an IP assignment readily at hand your options are a) locating the freelancer and convincing them to sign additional contracts or b) doing a quick cleanroom reimplementation of code you might not even have know existed.<p>It&#x27;s not like OSSing the code will quiet the criticism, either.  Some folks simply want to see it OSSed for the same reason they want to see their football team win, but some of the folks have the notion that they&#x27;re actually going to use it.  When it doesn&#x27;t work (and it <i>won&#x27;t work</i>), they&#x27;re going to expect you to fix that for them.  For free, naturally.  This will often entail doing free tech support for other people&#x27;s software -- in some cases, other people&#x27;s very expensive software that they should probably be paying professionals to support for their customers.<p>If any of this discomfits OSS users, the mint prints out paper ballots which allow you to allocate your votes on desired outcomes for the future.  See that some go to the people responsible for software you can&#x27;t live without.",1416624537

Unless you&#x27;re advising every individual person on Earth to run their own individual computing infrastructure.<p>Kragen&#x27;s argument isn&#x27;t for an <i>atomized</i> Internet, but for a <i>decentralized</i> one.  If that means that there are local hubs or clusters that a neighborhood of 10 y.o.s could access and use, it would be a vastly better world than one in which only a handful of giants provided equivalent services.<p>You&#x27;re also showing an impressive lack of imagination in terms of what it is to have an online presence.  A decentralized structure with a cache-and-forward, high-replication, mesh-net structure could well function from minimal personal investments as a point-of-entry.

There are <i>very</i> inexpensive servers which offer similar functionality.<p>There&#x27;s another economic class which is comparable in means to your hypothetical 10 year old as well:  the vast underclasses of the world, with annual incomes ranging from $200 - $2000/year.  Even among these, access to minimal levels of technology is highly sought simply because it hugely reduces the costs, and provides tremendous values, from communications.<p>Outernet (featured a few times on HN) is one example of an information service which is aimed at this population, with concerns over cost, energy access, censorship, surveillance, and content quality.

Let me just say that he was someone who had recently finished his PhD and was taking a summer data science sabbatical with Uber. I know that they were also working on how to optimize the distribution of cars to best serve a market but that would be pretty boring to talk about. I think what you are seeing in &quot;having fun&quot; with the data is actually more of the neuroscientist/psychologist coming out in him combined with his propensity for making science topics interesting and maybe a little sensational. This is the guy who also brought us zombie neuroscience remember (check it out if you aren&#x27;t familiar). At best we are daily trying to infer subjects internal processing/motivations from the sorts of actual behavioral measures we collect in the lab. This is one where behavioral inferences are perhaps better than self-report. As to your other point, I can even see how knowing how many people are being frisky and where they live being used to improve public health policy although that was obviously not the point (and it being kept anon of course). But let&#x27;s not forget that a cohort of uber riders is not a very uniform sample of the population and you are going to be somewhat limited in your ability to use it as a tool for social justice. He did a similar analysis although more in line with our lab work where he combined a big brain training app&#x27;s anon user data with their state geography and its demographics to draw some interesting conclusions that you wouldn&#x27;t have expected. These are just the application of techniques that we use in the lab to make inferences about brain activity and unravel its complexity and weave an understandable story.

Plus, if the tangibles don&#x27;t come with the thought leadership recognition, someone else will usually come along, and recognize you in the way you want to be recognized.",1416621987
