8503138,comment,8502784,8502784,0,0,quaunaut,,,"I always see these people commenting on how they don&#x27;t see the value in Airbnb. I&#x27;ve gotta say, after staying at a few places, I don&#x27;t see the value anywhere else.<p>* Hilton Worldwide has yearly revenues of $9.7b.<p>* Marriott International has yearly revenues of $11.8b.<p>* Best Western has yearly revenues of $6b.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t know what their current revenues are. Based on how many people from all over the US I&#x27;ve spoken to that use them frequently already, I&#x27;d assume they&#x27;re growing at a decent clip. Furthermore, they have virality on their side, where their competitors just plain don&#x27;t. It takes years to open a new hotel. If Airbnb wants to deploy to Casper, WY, they only have to make the effort insofar as basic background checks. If they want to do a stronger deployment, they find maid services and anything else they might need to support local hosts.<p>Furthermore, as much as there are local law issues in places like NYC against them, I don&#x27;t anticipate those lasting long or having a large effect on their revenues. The same way that if you&#x27;re in Uber&#x27;s way you get painted as being anti-jobs, Airbnb gets to say the same thing. And that&#x27;s in the few places that have them.<p>I think they&#x27;ve got a long way to grow. I look at $13b, and part of me thinks that might even be soft, especially if they look into starting their own hotels, to provide a higher &#x27;minimum&#x27; to a given city, which allows Airbnb to maintain itself as a premium brand(as yet, I&#x27;ve never stayed or heard anyone else staying anywhere that wasn&#x27;t a much better deal than anything else nearby), even if their prices don&#x27;t reflect it.<p>Remember: These valuations aren&#x27;t for what a company is <i>currently</i> worth. Otherwise, there&#x27;s no point to investment. They valuations are for where they see the company going, and more probably, growing past.",1414150504

Yes, it&#x27;s perfectly true that gut bacteria do not make up a huge percentage of your body mass, but you could say the same thing about your kidneys & anyone who claimed that the kidney &quot;just takes waste products from the bloodstream and excretes them as urine&quot; would be over simplifying things enormously. That statement is as true as the &quot;gut bacteria are only 1% of your body mass&quot; one, but it also misses out on a lot of complexity - the kidneys are involved in all sorts of hormonal feedback loops & can go wrong in many weird and wonderful ways. The same is true of the gut, and that&#x27;s the point of the original statement about the vast number of gut bacteria IMO - it&#x27;s reminding us that the digestive system is in fact very complex and an active participant in hormonal feedback loops that affect the rest of the body, including those that affect how much we want to eat.",1414150286

8503046,comment,8497214,8498376,0,0,tomp,,,"So, I think my ideas about syntax are similar in their goals, but different in some details.<p>1) I experimented with Pratt parsers, and actually made a great, extensible, full-blown parser, but the devil was in the details - if you parse your whole language with a Pratt parser, you have to get the operator/keyword precedence and associativity <i>just</i> right. It&#x27;s probably possible to get it just right, but the problem with Pratt parsers is that you <i>just don&#x27;t know</i> it; in particular, you don&#x27;t know if your syntax has any ambiguities (i.e. things that might not parse the way you want them to).<p>2) Because of that, I abandoned Pratt parsers and went back to LALR(1) (yacc). It&#x27;s tedious and complicated, but it has the nice property that it notifies you of <i>all</i> syntax ambiguities, a property that I haven&#x27;t found in any other parsing system (recursive descent/LL, Pratt, PEG). Of course, some people say that PEG is unambiguous, but these people are either stupid or ignorant; PEG just doesn&#x27;t tell you where the ambiguities exist, and always takes the first choice. LALR is &quot;not ambiguous&quot; in the same way, in case of shift/reduce conflict it always chooses shift, in case of reduce/reduce conflict it chooses the first choice, but at least it tells you where the choices were made, so that you can examine and fix them.<p>3) LALR(1) is also quite stupid and limited, which is why Menhir has been a blessing - it&#x27;s practically as efficient as ocamlyacc (in theory, at least - ocamlyacc produces compiled C code, while Menhir produces OCaml with Obj.magic), but parses LR(1) instead of LALR(1), which makes writing grammars for it much easier, and produces nicer error messages. I&#x27;ve managed to write a very flexible, Julia-like syntax (except with {} instead of begin/end) that supports tuples, arrow function syntax, and pattern matching.<p>4) Extensibility is important for me, but I intentionally want to limit it - I don&#x27;t want programmers to be able to (re)define basic language syntax, like ` = `, as that could fragment the code and make the syntax unpredictable/ambiguous. However, I want to include user-defined operators (with custom precedence/associativity), which could be done using an embedded Pratt parser, and Julia-like macros that are always preceded by `@` and can only be used in a few predetermined forms (function calls/statements/blocks). I think that makes the syntax much more manageable and readable. Also, I don&#x27;t like Elixir&#x27;s syntax, to many semicolons/`do:` keywords. I haven&#x27;t actually implemented the above yet, but I think it could be done within my current Menhir parser infrastructure.<p>Another thing: I too strongly discourage the name Meta, <i>especially</i> for OCaml, because there is already a project that&#x27;s called MetaOCaml.",1414148642
