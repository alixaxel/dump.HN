Likewise, if the cerebral region responsible for releasing Dopamin and Serotonin, or whatever else is not functioning as intended in depressive people, would shrink, like an untrained muscle, supplementing with medication only helps so far, when it doesn&#x27;t stop the shrinkage. I say shrinkige, because I don&#x27;t know a proper explanation, mind you. Now, if there is nothing else to doctor about, it&#x27;s well better than nothing, but it isn&#x27;t the end of the story.

8504604,comment,8503992,8504224,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"True, sort of. But the contrary point is that they want to discourage e.g. people from New York buying some home for $10k out of pocket, not doing anything with it and hoping to flip it in 20 years, as in any big city a plot like that alone is worth $50-60k. Demand is great, but you really want to get people to actually live there, too.<p>Haven&#x27;t heard of any requirements for a plan, can you elaborate? Afaik, you own the plot and can leave it shitty if you want as long as it&#x27;s not a safety hazard.<p>> Often buyers are legally required to rehab these homes to bring them up to code. In Detroit, buyers are required to sign Affidavits of Compliance Responsibility, which obligates them to make repairs outlined in an inspection report. Only after that can a certificate of occupancy will be issued, which makes the house legal to live in.<p>Found this, seems to only apply for a certificate of occupancy (meaning you could let it sit as a long-term investment hoping the rest of the city improves to the extent your property value rises enough to make renovation an easy profit) not sure if it&#x27;s what you&#x27;re referring to.",1414169687

8504587,comment,8502134,8504481,0,0,finder83,,,"I was also self-taught and it took a good 2 years for me to get to the point to be able to write maintainable code. Here are the lessons I learned, in no particular order:<p>1.) Read your code after you write it. I do this via git diff --cached. It&#x27;s amazing how many bugs you catch this way. Be critical of variable names, code layout or confusion, lack of documentation. It&#x27;s basically doing your own code review. Is it documented? Is it tested? Does it make sense logically? Is it easy to read?<p>2.) Document stuff. Fluff documentation is even fine to start with, you&#x27;ll eventually learn to separate the important documentation from fluff. Ultimately you need to get to the point of the &quot;why&quot; code does what it does, not the &quot;what&quot; it does. &quot;What&quot; it does should be evident by the code itself and the variable names/etc.<p>3.) Plan ahead. I don&#x27;t mean pseudo-code per-se...more thinking or writing down how code will fit together. Mind mapping is great for this, particularly with a white board or tile. I have a Galaxy Note that I bought partially for this purpose and use Papyrus for it now. Basically, how do the abstractions and parts fit together? Is it logical? Not everything requires a whiteboard, but a few minutes of thinking ahead can help spaghetti code a lot.<p>4.) Learn different programming paradigms. OO style can quickly become un-maintainable even to pros. I suggest learning functional programming in a language like Scheme/Clojure, Lisp, or Erlang. I now pick up a new language every year in different paradigms...not so much to learn the language or to brag, but to learn different way things can be architected, and the way other languages do things.<p>5.) Do refactor. Outside of budget constraints, don&#x27;t be afraid to rewrite code that doesn&#x27;t seem to flow properly.<p>You mentioned sitting with a senior dev...that was pretty huge for me too, even in limited times. (I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay for it, but it did cut the learning curve down quite a bit) Having someone do code reviews of your code that knows what they&#x27;re doing and invests time in it is helpful too. I&#x27;ve found though that not every Senior dev is good at reviewing code or teaching...<p>Sorry, I don&#x27;t have any actual resources for this other than well structured code like Django (mostly) or sqlite. I now have a B.S. in CS and I don&#x27;t really think they teach this well in schools either. Patterns will only get you so far in OO too...generally, trying new languages, reading code, and refactoring has made the largest impact on me.",1414169547

And then there&#x27;s annual property tax which are really high.<p>I don&#x27;t exactly know why... But I&#x27;ve seen houses which get taxed on a value that&#x27;s 5-10x the value of the house. And beyond that, the tax rate is often 3x higher than other cities.<p>So you might have a house that&#x27;s worth just $20k, but then it&#x27;s valued-for-tax at $100k, and you pay 4% on that. So you&#x27;re paying $4k in taxes or 20% of the house&#x27;s value every year. It&#x27;s insane.<p>And it&#x27;s keeping people out. I for one am not interested in paying $10k in old taxes for a cheap home I have to completely newbuild, and then pay taxes on it as if I was paying rent on top of a mortgage.<p>But it&#x27;s probably a goldmine for any company with a 50-year vision who can get economies of scale on things like construction, and can negotiate huge tax-relief deals, e.g. waive old taxes and waive taxes the first 5 years etc.",1414169340

Most developers want to offer functionality (e.g. share to contacts) but don&#x27;t want to do so at the cost of losing users (&quot;Why is this asking to see my contact list?&quot;).<p>Android needs to drop a bunch of &quot;silly&quot; permissions that have no inherent cost to the user. They&#x27;re clearly created by an engineer who just wanted to slap permissions on every kind of API for no good reason. It benefits nobody.<p>They then need to take permissions which have a cost (either literally or to user privacy) and set them up rationally so they&#x27;re either something you get when installing OR something you&#x27;ll be prompted for.<p>Lastly Android needs to add a description field to the permissions manifest where the developer can put in a short explanation for why they need permission XYZ. Limit it to 128 characters if you wish. The app store can display these.<p>I install less apps on Android largely because many ask for too many permissions. If Google makes it really easy for me to protect my personal information (e.g. prompts) I&#x27;ll literally spend more money on their store because I&#x27;ll feel more safe to do so.

I quickly made the jump from researcher to practicum precisely because I was trained as a researcher, then applied those skills to understanding what my customers needed.<p>I think what allowed you to make that jump was that you were inherently familiar with the problem domain; even though your customers did research in another discipline, at the end of the day they were still researchers.<p>I was the lead trainer at my company, and the training materials (hundreds of pages of them) used to be on Word documents. I got fed up with it, taught myself Rails, developed and deployed a learning management system, and migrated the content there. It was very successful because as the lead trainer, I knew exactly what features would be needed and how they should work. It was kind of funny actually because when I gave a demo to the trainers in other teams, they basically said, &quot;wow, this is <i>exactly</i> what we need -- when can we start using it?&quot; Which is music to any programmer&#x27;s ears.",1414166620

Exactly the opposite of the Hippocratic Oath.

And few people in your industry acknowledge that.<p>The stock market has a built-in upward bias of 3-5 percent. It represents the premium over the risk free rate that entices people to invest in equity instead of debt (bonds, treasuries). So retail investors don&#x27;t &quot;lose&quot; money but they have underperformed the market to a extent that is IMO criminal. Literally.<p>All of the education, services and tools (like yours) are teaching investing all wrong. Price targets? Made up numbers by analysts? What were the price targets on Netflix before it fell 100 handles (and then clawed half of it back)? The day before the drop CNBC said $600/share. How about GTAT? Jim Cramer loved that stock.<p>There are some people doing it right, though. Check out TastyTrade.com. These guys have made a massive investment in teaching the retail investor techniques for investing that don&#x27;t rely on the magic of technical analysis or analyst prophecy. And even more awesome -- they built a trading platform that is free to use and provides tooling to support their principles, which are basically: do many small, high probability trades to give yourself many independent occurrences to smooth statistical variance, and let duration work for you. The platform is Dough.com<p>I&#x27;m obviously not affiliated, just a fan. And I don&#x27;t mean to take away anything from what you&#x27;ve built.
