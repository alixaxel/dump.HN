How long before the next Target or Home Depot has a credit card breach?  How long before this centralized authority blocks non-dealer shops from being part of the network (or pay exorbitant fees).<p>We can decentralize all this while still keeping it cryptographically secure.",1414454379

C++ is inherently limited, and a string type is often the only way to have certain design guarantees.  In a performance-critical context, it&#x27;s sometimes crucial to control the exact pattern of allocation.  And not just <i>how</i> they&#x27;re allocated in memory, but also <i>how often</i> they&#x27;re allocated.  You can control std::string&#x27;s pattern of allocation by using a custom allocator, but you can&#x27;t control how often std::strings are created, for example, because std::string implements an interface which is guaranteed to construct temporary strings.  This normally isn&#x27;t a problem, but in contexts where every millisecond is crucial (like gaming) this can be disastrous, since it&#x27;s very hard to optimize the performance characteristics of std::string once it becomes pervasively used throughout your codebase.<p>Another reason to make your own string type is for proper unicode support.

The national legislature passes very general laws, like the Clean Water Act, and charges an administrative agency with implementing them, and the courts with interpreting them and resolving disputes over what they mean. States do something similar. A city that wants to do something like build a metro line must therefore pass a series of these general requirements. They do things like prepare environmental impact statements, noise-abatement statements, seek EPA and other agencies&#x27; approval of plans, seek state approval of plans, etc. Various stakeholders or members of the general public can challenge these plans at each stage (sometimes up to a dozen or so agencies may be involved). If the plans make it through that stage, such people can then sue in state or federal court, using any of these dozens of laws, looking for an injunction to halt construction, modifications to the plans, etc. The end result of all this is a lot of delay and expense, even apart from any actual construction issues.<p>In many other countries the process is somewhat more legislative. A city proposes a metro line, and seeks the direct approval of higher levels of government: there are discussions, hearings, and then the plans are passed into law. Once the plan is law, then it&#x27;s law: the legislature is presumed to have weighed the pros and cons and made the decision, so you can usually no longer challenge it on environmental grounds, noise-pollution grounds, or anything else, because that power is not delegated to agencies or courts.<p>In short: the U.S. both has a lot more layers of government (city, transit district, county, state, national), and delegates much more case-by-case decision-making power to administrative agencies and courts.",1414452448

What I mean by that is: if you could do a share-rental, you&#x27;d find a lot more places would become in your price range.  The downside of course is, you must live with more people than you&#x27;d like to.  It can be a challenge, but if the house is large or you get your own wing, it could be pretty livable, at least for a set time period.  The other thing you might do would be consult with a local real estate specialist who could do some quick leg-work for you here.  (Sure, they will charge you, but maybe it won&#x27;t be too much. :/ It&#x27;s just meant as a possible idea for you.)  Short of that, definitely look at Craigslist, but keep in mind, things could go (become rented) very, very fast.  The $1200 limit is very tough to work with, because rents are shockingly high in the Bay Area.  A small town you might find something in might be: Port Costa.  Someone else mentioned Crockett (where I originally found your post referenced).  If you look on a map, you&#x27;ll see these two enclaves are close to each other.  Crockett is known for being eccentric, artistic, having a huge sugar factory, and being located on the water (the Carquinez Straits).  The houses are generally old, and some are sweet and interesting.  You would feel like you were in a &#x27;real&#x27; small town, but at the same time still not too terribly far from what you need, mileage-wise.  Port Costa is just a little beyond Crockett, down a small road, off of Highway 4.  It is also known for being an out-of-the-way artsy and eccentric place.  I would say Port Costa is generally quite safe. You still will probably have trouble finding anything that is at your $1200 mark, but it will be only a few hundred over.  (This might seem like too much still.  I&#x27;m sorry!)  I&#x27;m talking about HOMES — not apartments — so you may find cheaper for an apartment, specifically up there, but the towns are mostly comprised of homes (not apartments).  I am sorry some people are laughing, but it&#x27;s easy for us to forget how insane our pricing is here.  We have endured it for so long!  Please consider looking in to the share-rental idea.  You can find things like that also on Craigslist!   You also might try Martinez.  It is the County Seat of Contra Costa County.  No place will be completely free of crime or undesirable activity, but for your price range you&#x27;ll do well to try these.  I would be careful about apartments in Martinez, only because some buildings focus on &#x27;low income&#x27; renters and (I&#x27;m not trying to disparage low-income people...)there can be &#x27;a few bad apples&#x27; so to speak.  I see someone else mentioned Concord.

While these operations can be written with a single x86 assembly instruction, internally they are split into different µops which execute on different ports.  Here&#x27;s Agner&#x27;s chart[1] for ADD and SUB on Haswell (with some typographic editing for clarity):<p><pre><code>    inst   operands  fused unfused     ports   latency throughput
  ADD SUB  r <- r/i    1    1      p0156             1 0.25
  ADD SUB  r <- m      1    2      p0156 p23           0.5
  ADD SUB  m <- r/i    2    4      2p0156 2p237 p4   6 1
</code></pre>
This is saying that adding register (r) to a register or an immediate (i) takes one µop which executes on any one of Ports 0, 1, 5, or 6, has a latency of 1 cycle, and that 4 of these can be executed per cycle.<p>For an add that comes from memory with the result put in the register, the instruction is decoded as a single µop (fused), but this is executed as two separate µops: one on Port 0, 1, 5, or 6; and one on Port 2 or 3.  Latency is unspecified (depends on the source of the load), and you can execute a maximum of 2 per cycle.<p>For an adding a register with a memory location and storing the result to memory, the single x86 assembly instruction decodes to 2 fused µops, which then execute as 4 unfused µops: two on any combination of Ports 0, 1, 5, or 6; one on Port 2, 3, or 7; and one on Port 4.   The latency is at least 6 cycles, and at best you can sustain one of these per cycle.<p><i>The uops/instruction number looks bogus. I remember those numbers being very close 1. The cycles per uop of 0.37 seems wildly optimistic. I remember numbers closer to 1.</i><p>It&#x27;s easier now than then, but depending on workload, executing 3 µops per cycle (.33) is easily achievable for optimized code.   The current limit is essentially 4 (.25), but even this is within reach.  I recently had a pathological case where I sustained almost 5 µops executed per cycle (.21), which at first glance is impossible since only 4 µops can be issued or retired per cycle.  I think what was happening was that due to failed memory disambiguation, some of the stores and loads were being executed twice before being retired.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.agner.org/optimize/microarchitecture.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agner.org/optimize/microarchitecture.pdf</a>",1414451390

8518680,comment,8517187,8518586,0,0,djur,,,"The difficulties in the US can be traced to three facts about the United States: elections (including eligibility standards and voting processes) being constitutionally the responsibility of the states, citizens having free movement between the states, and jus soli citizenship. (I would personally say the latter two are good things about the US, but not the first.) Add to that the difficulty in getting the states to go along with the federal government without being compelled, and you have an intractable problem.",1414450953

On at least one occasion, I&#x27;ve been desperate and taken terrible jobs to cover my rent.

I think my predecessor employed the same controller cards as version 1 of the pods.  You could tell that the smart queries pre-empted normal io as the smart query would be executed, and disk activity for certain swift object servers would just stall.  The object-servers would not return requests for at least some of the drives until the smart query was finished.<p>Curiously enough, I&#x27;ve also ran smartctl against Samsung 840Pros using Highpoint RocketRaid controller cards during the same project.  Sometimes this crashes the controller card.<p>(This was for a gluster cluster, when gluster had broken quorum support. A copy of a piece of data, when out of sync with the other copies in a replica set, would be left unchecked.  This was produced after one smartctl command took out the controller card, and then the machine along with it.)",1414450854

If it is electrical contact related, could you not use a gel like another commenter mentioned using with a chest strap?<p>It seems like a gimmick, but I&#x27;ve had good results with one of the iPhone apps where you place your finger over the camera and it&#x27;s illuminated by the flash. You have to keep the finger in a constant position, but it works reliably if you do. So I have hope for new technology.<p>Completely different area, but there&#x27;s this technology:<p><a href=""http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/vidmag/</a><p>which seems surprisingly robust. If you can get heart rate from standard video, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to find it&#x27;s possible to get a reliable signal with a LED and light sensor placed directly against the skin–especially if it&#x27;s done in addition to an electrical signal.<p>Either way, we&#x27;ll find out soon enough. The Apple watch claims to give heart rate too, and they&#x27;re going to get absolutely slammed in the media if they don&#x27;t live up to it. Will be interesting to see!",1414450815
