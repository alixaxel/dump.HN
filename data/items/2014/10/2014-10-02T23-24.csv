Instead I value being flexible and being able to adapt to whatever system I&#x27;m using.<p>In practice, this means that whenever I think about making some change to my software environment, my first impulse is to ask myself, &quot;do I really have to change this?&quot; This is a 180 from my old, college-age attitude, in which I not only wouldn&#x27;t question the impulse, I would look for ways to automate making as many little changes and tweaks as possible. At the time I thought I was doing it because I was really increasing my productivity, when in fact I was just doing it because it was fun and fed into my self-image as a super l33t hacker guy. If anything, it was a distraction from whatever I was actually supposed to be working on.",1412294381

8403776,comment,8402229,8403595,3,0,zten,,,"I agree that interval training is the way to go here, but it&#x27;s definitely more nuanced than only targeting VO2max in zone 4. I&#x27;m going to talk from the perspective of cycling. This image is a reproduction of a chart from &quot;Training and Racing with a Power Meter&quot;: <a href=""http://lh4.ggpht.com/-bEo_kR-QvlM/UtSoVtZ1PlI/AAAAAAAAC2s/Q9pnwpkV6L8/s1600-h/image46.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lh4.ggpht.com/-bEo_kR-QvlM/UtSoVtZ1PlI/AAAAAAAAC2s/Q9...</a><p>You&#x27;ll get some benefit across almost the entire spectrum almost no matter where you are focusing your efforts. You only see this diverge at the extremes: too easy, and you&#x27;re just recovering; too hard, and you&#x27;re only optimizing the systems that allow you to go really hard.<p>For some reason when I think of HIIT I picture people as trying to do Tabata intervals and you can see from that chart that you sort of run into a problem: you get the same level of benefit as if you just went slowly for a long time (this part is key -- the chart doesn&#x27;t highlight how long you should expect to spend in the zone to get the benefit, whereas the training plans in the book make it clear that they expect you to sit in zone 2 for 2-4 hours at a stretch. Compare that to the 3-8 minute VO2max intervals for 3-6 repetitions.), while only really optimizing your ability to endure future Tabata intervals.<p>The real reason to be concerned with any of this at all is to focus your training and build up the appropriate ability without injuring yourself and without hampering your training down the road. Based on the previous chart, it seems like Z4 and Z5 have the most number of pluses, but they also build up the most damage as they are physically and mentally taxing -- you&#x27;ll build training plans around 3-20 minute intervals in those zones instead, and fill in the gaps with Z2 work or rest.<p>If you&#x27;re time-crunched, you may do abbreviated intervals at Z5, decrease the time you spend at Z2, and shift some of your training effort into Z3 instead. But Z3 starts to get hard enough where it impacts your recovery without giving you the most desirable adaptations. The ideal thing to do here is to increase your training time so you can spend more time in Z2, but we don&#x27;t all have that luxury, unfortunately.",1412294351

8403774,comment,8401484,8403015,2,0,nwenzel,,,"How to figure out if you&#x27;ve built something people want.<p>1) Get someone to give you money. Hearing, &quot;oh, I&#x27;d buy that!&quot; is not the same as, &quot;here&#x27;s my credit card number.&quot;<p>2) Get them to give you money even though your product is not totally ready for prime time. Basically, even though your product is not done, not refined, difficult to use, etc., having your product is still so much better than not having it that someone is still willing to pay.<p>3) Short of getting someone to pay you, get them to get past some level of friction. If someone will invest their time to cross the chasm of not-user to user, it means they really want what is on the other side.<p>4) Get someone to use your product again. There&#x27;s a reason online apps look at Active Daily/Monthly Users. If someone uses it, then uses it again... it must be something they want.<p>5) Don&#x27;t have a product yet, just an idea... pre-orders (see point 1).<p>6) Can&#x27;t even take pre-orders... You&#x27;re just guessing. Build an MVP (or minimum sellable product if you&#x27;re in enterprise). Don&#x27;t try to take on the world. Find the minimum that can offer.

8403770,comment,8402229,8403386,4,0,benihana,,,"I can&#x27;t say why anyone downvoted you, but reading your comment I noticed a few things:<p>1. Your use of the term running. You make sweeping generalizations about &#x27;running&#x27; and the people who run but you don&#x27;t even define what &#x27;running&#x27; is. Is it long, low intensity work like running more than 10 miles? Is it short, high intensity work like sprints? Is it a simple jog a couple times a week? Is it a hard run? Running is a blanket term for many different exercises and exercise styles.<p>2. You seem to conflate exercise with &#x27;running.&#x27; I hate running, but I really enjoy exercise. I love lifting weights, playing sports, and climbing. I don&#x27;t ever feel pain when I do any of those unless something is very wrong. Discomfort maybe, but discomfort is not pain.<p>3. Your whole point is hinged upon a logical fallacy. You say that nobody enjoys exercise because nobody <i>really</i> exercises. If they were <i>really</i> exercising, they&#x27;d be in pain constantly, and therefore, since nobody enjoys being in pain (an assumption you made in your post) nobody enjoys exercising. I don&#x27;t hang with a lot of long distance people, but all the weightlifters I exercise with will tell you if you&#x27;re in pain, something is seriously seriously wrong.<p>4. Your presumption throughout the post. Take the last sentence. You say that anyone who enjoys exercise has to learn to enjoy it. What is the point of that sentence? Are you speaking from experience? Are you telling people they&#x27;re not really exercising? Later in this thread, you say you can&#x27;t relate to the responses. So why are you making sweeping assumptions about people if you can&#x27;t relate to things they say?<p>5. You&#x27;re empirically wrong. There are a handful of responses already with anecdotal evidence to the contrary of everything you say. Millions of people exercise every day and love it, and nobody disputes that exercise is beneficial. It&#x27;s really hard to understand where you&#x27;re coming from.<p>The post was odd and confusing. It came off as very presumptuous and arrogant - like you know something about exercise no one here could possibly understand. A good number of people who come here exercise regularly and have learned all about it themselves, and know from their own experiences that what you&#x27;re saying doesn&#x27;t make much sense.",1412294219

NFC / Chip hold unique tokens that have on device cryptography, exactly as you&#x27;ve described. You can&#x27;t &quot;steal&quot; anything of consequence via NFC or the chip, and that&#x27;s why it was designed. Further while you say that it&#x27;s for the vendor, the liable party for fraud is actually the credit card companies, which is exactly why they made EMV.<p>You seem to think this is all new because of EMVCo, however it is a standardization for the last mile: Google Wallet originally was doing what the credit cards themselves do, holding the secret key and identifiers on an NXP secure element. There are issues with that (largely carrier related) which is why the industry started moving to software-held tokens, as in the Apple solution. Presenting an iPhone token offers zero additional security over presenting a Canadian chip or NFC credit card, and that notion is rather ridiculous.",1412294181

That leaves 100-250 that will succeed. Techstars is only taking 1% of applicants, which is 10 startups. Unless Techstars is picking poorly, they are selecting companies that are positioned for success from day one. These startups would most likely succeed with or without Techstars.&quot;<p>The common assumption that 75%-90% of startups fail is usually regarding venture backed startups, not people who fill out the TechStars applications.

The data covered by that kind of encryption would likely be of very limited use for national security; the NSA gets most of the data at the backbone switches anyway, and encryption doesn&#x27;t do anything to prevent relationship mapping from logs of routing metadata. Also, any kind of <i>targeted</i> investigation could simply bypass encryption by installing custom firmware. Several of the tools in the TAO catalog were based on that style of attack.<p>What would be lost with local iPhone encryption keys is the ability to gather large amounts of data by strong-arming Apple (Prism, possibly). Note that most of the people freaking out over Apple&#x27;s changes are not NSA. It is law enforcement who is fearing losing their access; the same law enforcement that would be using parallel construction to actually <i>use</i> the data that logically they didn&#x27;t have a warrant to search and seize. (if they did have a warrant, they can bypass the encryption with various other ways, which apparently includes compelling passwords)<p>As for the Reuters article, I linked to a specific document that was a follow-up to that Reuters article, which had very little to do with foreign governments, and a lot to do with <i>protecting access</i> to the surveillance infrastructure.

One such example is CA ControlMinder.<p>It can protect files/programs/processes at the kernel level and redirect authorization attempts through its own authorization engine and then back through the original syscall (if permitted).  So, you shouldn&#x27;t, but you could chmod a file to have world-read/world-write access and then set default access to the file to &#x27;none&#x27; via this authorization engine and it would still be inaccessible to all users (even root).<p>You can form more granular controls, such as &#x27;this file can only be accessed by the process launched by program with device/inode xx/yy&#x27;, and &#x27;this program cannot be launched if any of these 8 attribute checks show as being modified&#x27;..<p>By the same interception mechanism, auditing can be performed which records when specified files are accessed, by whom, and which server they had originally connected from when they did it.  An audit only mode can simply monitor activity without performing any denials.  Add in a keylogger that targets terminals of specific users, or just specific surrogate accounts (eg, when any user su&#x27;s to root) and you can get a closer inspection of all activity performed (and not just activity to specific protected files/resources).<p>So, it&#x27;s possible to tell what&#x27;s been compromised, but one would need to be running such security software and have it properly configured for auditing the right resources.

They do this quite openly. They manufacture these things in many of the same boring factories that make the reputable brands.
