I&#x27;m struggling to think of one besides drugs.  Certainly coke or heroin.  Pot is often sold in eighths, while hash is sold in grams.<p>Nobody in America discusses weight of speakers, computers, or <i>anything</i> in kilos.  Perhaps the only other place I&#x27;ve heard it used is for bumper plates.  I&#x27;d frankly bet more than 90% of Americans couldn&#x27;t tell you off the top of their heads if a kilo weighs more or less than a pound.",1413101398

As long as you aren&#x27;t spending beyond your means, what&#x27;s wrong with allocating more money to housing?  Say I want a bigger apartment, and I&#x27;m willing to drastically cut back on restaurant outings to make up the difference.  How is allocating 50% to housing and 25% to food (assuming that 25% buys you healthy meals all year) less sustainable than allocating 25% to housing and 50% to food (talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout some pretty nice food here)?",1413101212

We did have such a vote on marijuana recently in California, and we lost.  We&#x27;ll probably have another vote in 2016.

An OS <i>is</i> the garden you want people to come to so you have prime real estate to sell your wares. Charging admission works great if you&#x27;re the only garden in town... and not so much if you&#x27;re not. Microsoft is putting itself into this position by forcing the market to move into the other, more easily accessible gardens. It has very little to do with UX/UI or anything like that. Most consumers actually don&#x27;t want to learn how to do anything new if they can ever help it.<p>I&#x27;m constantly amazed that all these &quot;experts&quot; haven&#x27;t figured out what happened to the 800 pound gorilla. Quite simply put, other gardens that people could live with and easier to access suddenly showed up. The vendors making and selling their wares went to the place people were at or wanted to go to. Its simple economics and you can point directly to the people who decided that WGA was a good idea for killing MS. Piracy <i>itself</i> is what made windows dominant to begin with.",1413101003
