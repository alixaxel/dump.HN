Before her diagnosis I often wondered if she had some sort of mental illness because she would always describe having out-of-body experiences where she subjectively witnessed herself doing things in third person.<p>After she was diagnosed and went gluten free, there was an acute &quot;rebound&quot; phase where she had very painful rashes like the article mentions. But she also had a lot more energy and no longer slept 12 hours a day.

We had to rebuild the mold each time and break it with a hammer to pull out the token.<p>We never even tried the tokens. And I think the lead fumes from melting it on a bunsen burner from my Christmas chemistry set probably didn&#x27;t help us in the long run...<p>Making nitrogen tri-iodide in high-school had a much better payoff, even if we had to steal the solid iodine from the chemistry class supply closet.

Don&#x27;t bother.<p>I&#x27;d recommend aligning yourself with a half-dozen dev shops. (They may call themselves &quot;Full Service Marketing&quot; firms, or &quot;Agencies&quot; or whatever.) Just look for some shops that are getting consistent clients. Reach out and tell them you&#x27;re capable of XYZ; many will be willing to farm work out to you if you&#x27;re good and reliable. They typically don&#x27;t care where you&#x27;re physically located....just that you can hit a deadline.<p>There&#x27;s very little downside to them bringing you on (the more programmers in their arsenal, the larger they can scale their client base), so your chances are pretty good at landing a gig. But, as each agency is typically &quot;Feast and Famine&quot; (big project followed by lull) you&#x27;ll want to balance out the highs and lows by aligning yourself with several shops, and always keeping multiple incoming streams. This last part is crucial, always assume that any given shop may screw you over at any moment, keep your income diversified.<p>I lived this way for several years, and it was a blast.",1413147227

Concern #1 would be when / where / why you would distribute my encryption keys.  For example, I am a SaaS, perhaps small, perhaps big.  You are a one-or-two person startup holding my encryption keys, and the FBI comes knocking with an NSL.  You will not have the money / resources to fight it, so you&#x27;ll turn over those keys without telling me (as you are required to by law).  However maybe it was a BS request, and maybe had I known about it I could have fought it with my A+ legal team.<p>The other issue is one of data mutability.  If you are just storing files, there is some merit in separate key storage.  However, if your SaaS does something with that data (converts it, processes it, moves it), then those encryption keys will be right back in the hands of the company doing the data holding.<p>Finally, there are very few companies that care enough about encryption to actually do it, and those who care that much about it probably won&#x27;t be willing to ship that functionality out of the company.<p>(A bit about me: I am a webapp security / crypto guy at a mid-sized SaaS company)",1413146116

Even if it was explicitly designed and implemented that way, from the viewpoint of the user this is an anti-feature; and the current system architecture that favors the will of the app developer over the will of the user is certainly feasible, but it explicitly means giving up control over the system.
