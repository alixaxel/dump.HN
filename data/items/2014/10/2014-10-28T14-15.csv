For over five years, they insisted that double-clicking the upper-left corner of the window should not close the window like every other app on the system. Nope. They insisted on doing it their way ignoring the complaints of thousands of users.<p>Firefox also makes you press Shift to use access keys. Totally non-standard amongst browsers and OSes and annoying for devs and users.<p>Is Firefox the only browser left that hasn&#x27;t switched to multiple processes?<p>No, Firefox isn&#x27;t better and I don&#x27;t trust Mozilla anymore than Google.",1414508358

As strange as it sounds, this is a reason why I don&#x27;t use chrome as my &quot;default&quot; browser. I seem to find the web sites that leak resources and leave them open in tabs (one of my projects at work is a big culprit too). With firefox a runaway tab or two simply results in a single CPU pegged at 100% and max about 2GB of ram consumption. With chrome it will peg out a couple CPU&#x27;s and eat RAM until my machine goes into swap. Usually this happens while I&#x27;m gone so simply unlocking the screen is a painful process as everything gets swapped in.<p>In other words I prefer having to kill firefox on a regular basis because its run out of RAM, than to have to reset my machine because its taking 10 minutes to unlock the screen.",1414507207

I wish my carpets and furniture weren&#x27;t all scratched up, but I really don&#x27;t care that much.<p>Corollary: Any manager > any project. The project may fail, but the manager may do another.<p>2. Let the cat initiate all action. They will let you know when they want to eat/sleep/play/cuddle/hang out. Respond predictably to their action.<p>Corollary: Keep coding until interrupted by your manager. Smile, listen, pretend to care, agree. Then continue coding.<p>3. Every time you return (even from the mailbox), greet the cat as if you hadn&#x27;t seen each other for years. I don&#x27;t know how cats perceive the passage time, but what difference does that really make?<p>Corollary: Document everything discussed with your manager and share the notes during your next meeting to remind them of what they probably won&#x27;t remember.<p>4. Listen to the cat. They <i>do</i> have words, just not in the same language. Tonality and body language leave very important clues.<p>Corollary: Learn the definition of terms like: bandwidth, key results, deep dive, follow-up, subject matter expert, and ROI so you know what the hell your manager is talking about.<p>5. Include the cat in your plans when applicable. They may surprise you by enjoying watching football on TV, relaxing in the yard, or even eating together.<p>Corollary: Give your manager a status report so they know what&#x27;s going on. Otherwise, they&#x27;ll just interrupt you when you&#x27;re right in the middle of coding a difficult algorithm.<p>6. If the cat gets scared, growls, scratches, or bites, you probably did something wrong. Identify and correct the problem.<p>Corollary: If the project fails, it&#x27;s your fault because it can&#x27;t be your manager&#x27;s fault.<p>7.

I especially like a paragraph from farther down in the article where the author brings up an issue that often comes up here on Hacker News: &quot;According to Pauline Kim, a professor at Washington University Law School, people tend to make inferences about the law based on what they know about more informal social norms. This frequently leads them to misunderstand their rights—and in areas like employment law, to wildly overestimate them. In 1997, Kim presented roughly 300 residents of Buffalo, New York, with a series of morally abhorrent workplace scenarios—for example, an employee is fired for reporting that a co-worker has been stealing from the company—that were nonetheless legal under the state’s &#x27;at-will&#x27; employment regime. Eighty to 90 percent of the Buffalonians incorrectly identified each of these distasteful scenarios as illegal, revealing how little they understood about how much freedom employers actually enjoy to fire employees.&quot; I have seen this misconception here on Hacker News many times. (To be sure, here on Hacker News we have participants from many countries, not all of which have the same laws about employment, but I have seen plenty of Americans proclaim &quot;facts&quot; about rights of employees here in the United States that simply are not facts.) Basically, in our thoughtful discussions here, we all have to take care to check our facts. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m especially glad to upvote comments that ask earlier commenters to explain where they got their information, or to suggest further reading on a topic. I&#x27;ll link a book here about employment law (mostly related to hiring procedures) as an example of the information I like to see in comments. I need to check my understanding of all issues, all the time, according to the article kindly submitted here, and I appreciate it when other HN participants help me find more information.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Safe-Hiring-Manual-Employment-Background/dp/1889150592/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Safe-Hiring-Manual-Employment-Backgrou...</a>",1414506923

I can think of three main likely arguments why he shouldn&#x27;t:<p>i) what he did breached civil but not criminal law: if so then obviously he shouldn&#x27;t be in jail. I don&#x27;t know whether that&#x27;s the case though. I also don&#x27;t know if he is personally liable for civil damages, and if so why he hasn&#x27;t been chased for those. (And that&#x27;s not going into the question of whether his actions <i>should</i> have been made criminal offences by law, and why they haven&#x27;t been.)<p>ii) the higher standard of evidence in criminal prosecutions, the first issue you raised. This is of course a real issue in criminal cases, but—speaking as a non-lawyer, non-expert who hasn&#x27;t been following the story very closely—the evidence on this matter doesn&#x27;t look at all lacking to me. AFAICS, if Eric Schmidt had been discussing a murder rather than salary collusion in the communications discussed by <a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-recruitment-emails-lawsuit-2014-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-recruitment-emai...</a> no-one would be likely to suggest that the evidence was too weak for a criminal prosecution.<p>iii) Eric Schmidt is a nice person like us, and jail isn&#x27;t <i>really</i> for nice people like us. I hope the egregiousness and total unacceptability of this argument is clear to everyone without any need for explanation.<p>So, yes, why shouldn&#x27;t Eric Schmidt be in jail?<p>As to the financial sector, while it is obviously difficult to prosecute many financial crimes, I am not convinced that this is the primary explanation for the shortage of convictions lately. I am reasonably convinced by the argument <a href=""http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2014/10/liars-loans-aint-rocket-science.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neweconomicperspectives.org/2014/10/liars-loans-aint-...</a> that similarly complex cases were successfully prosecuted in the S&L scandal in the &#x27;80s, and that the primary difference between then and now is lack of resources and political will.",1414506857

In the UK, letting your cat outside is the norm. The shelter I adopted from wouldn&#x27;t <i>give</i> you a cat unless you were able to let it out (or the cat had feline AIDS and needed to be kept indoors for protection).<p>But it&#x27;s the complete opposite in the U.S, and although that makes sense in some places (a lot more predators in the countryside), in a city like San Francisco the risks seem identical to those of London. It&#x27;s very strange. Of course, in the UK cat owners aren&#x27;t legally liable for their cat&#x27;s actions (cats, unlike dogs, are deemed by the law to be free agents), maybe that&#x27;s not the case in the states.",1414506525

A modern smartphone has better image capture than SLRs -- top of the line SLRs --from just ten years ago. Despite your focus on shutter lag (where you can prefocus/expose on a smartphone just like an SLR, and then have a close to instant shutter), the shutter lag on current smartphones is, again, similar to top of the line SLRs of a few years ago.<p>With a large sensor and lenses, at any given time you&#x27;ll always yield a better result (presuming you assume that such is always available when the moment arises).
