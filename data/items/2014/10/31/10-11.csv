8538152,comment,8536292,8536968,0,0,pluma,,,"If you consider the account of what happened surrounding the passing of the post-9/11 legislation as given here[0] factual, it was very much transported on emotion.<p>Sure, the original concept wasn&#x27;t new, but I&#x27;m fairly certain the emotional landscape at the time was intentionally used as a vehicle to pass these kinds of laws.<p>The saddest part is that many people who did pay attention at the time were fully aware of where this would go and were criticised or ridiculed at the time. My first thought upon learning of the PATRIOT Act was that it&#x27;s a creepy name for a bill that permanently erodes civil rights and protections, but apparently most people thought it was okay because A) it has a name you can&#x27;t possibly argue with (being considered un-patriotic in the aftermath of 9/11 would have been outrageous) and B) it&#x27;s only for dealing with terrorism anyway.<p>Kinda reminds me of the Internet censorship bill our politicians in Germany tried to pass some years ago. It was only to be used to restrict access to child pornography, of course. Because if there&#x27;s one thing that&#x27;s easier to rally people against than terrorism, it&#x27;s child abuse. And who can argue with combating child abuse?<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.radiolab.org/story/60-words/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.radiolab.org/story/60-words/</a>",1414753143

Other issues include the fact that there&#x27;s no killer game that explains why the new controller is really needed (most games just mirror the TV to the controller, or show inventory or a map on the controller), the fact that there&#x27;s only one controller with a screen, so most games that use it have asymmetric offline multiplayer gameplay (which can be difficult to explain to people), and the fact that playing the Wii U doesn&#x27;t look as much fun as playing bowling or tennis on the Wii did.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I think the Wii U is a console worth owning, and right now, it probably has the best games library of all current-gen TV consoles. I also think that poor marketing and misguiding naming play a role in its poor performance — why not call it the Wii 2, to clearly show that it is different and new?<p>But I don&#x27;t think that its failure can be attributed <i>solely</i> to marketing.",1414752996

8538145,comment,8534082,8536367,0,0,foobarbaz1234,,,"> It has no syntax (of its own) in that it hijacks s-expression syntax instead. When you want to write Lisp code, you actually write some data structures in the s-expression data format, like when writing some data in JSON or XML. Then a Lisp interpreter or compiler uses an s-expression parser to read that data structure into memory, and operates on that.<p>My point is that the s-expression format has to be defined (obviously), e.g. you enclose lists in &#x27;(&#x27; and &#x27;)&#x27; characters, space symbols separate tokens, etc. In my world these rules are consequences of a defined syntax and saying there is no syntax is just wrong. The reader parses at some point a byte sequence and builds an AST. That Lisp/Scheme has such a simple syntax is a powerful feature of the language but saying it has no syntax just contributes to the belief of misinformed people that Lisp is some kind of strange Voodoo-language which is a bad thing as it is a powerful tool.",1414752974

I have a background in embedded development and the perspective to have a modern, safe by default language available in the future (it&#x27;s a conservative domain ;) is very exciting!<p>Cargo aside, the question of ABI stability is an interesting one: if an implementation stick to stable features, will it be possible to link code compiled with a newer compiler with a library compiled with an older version? Or is the stability only at the language level for now?<p>I don&#x27;t think ABI stability is required at this stage. There&#x27;s been some experience with ABI changes with C++ and it&#x27;s always possible to deal with it by having interfaces defined using a C ABI (stable) to shield oneself, if needed (if recompiling everything is not practical). But clarifying the status and plan would be nice.<p>Thanks again.",1414752883

Look what they did to kimdotcom in total violation of law ... the NZ PM had to apologise personally. Gottfrid was illegally extradited from Cambodia. We&#x27;re yet to see any evidence to the contrary, despite claims his visa was up apparently it wasn&#x27;t, and this sort of put-on-plane-back-home treatment is not normal.. also, a fat Swedish aid package to Cambodia went through just after his extradition.<p>Gottfrid&#x27;s mother is an academic and has documented the strange behaviour of her own (Swedish) government around his arrest and treatment.<p>Denmark is a place where it&#x27;s almost impossible to use cash, where the ex-king kept a harem (it&#x27;s now a bakery/hotel: I stayed in it), and where the authorities don&#x27;t need a warrant to track your phone&#x27;s location over the last year.<p>The accusation is that, sitting in Cambodia, Gottfrid broke in to some computers for no apparent reason causing zero harm. The reality is that he was mistreated against any notion of personal rights, dragged halfway around the world and locked up in solitary confinement which is generally considered torture under UN definitions. He has been passed from state to state being mistreated. There is still no proof he did anything wrong or harmed anyone. However, there seems to be evidence he helped Assange decrypt the embarassing US military video &#x27;collateral damage&#x27;.<p>The only thing I conclude from this ruling is that the west in general is only a downward spiral in to totalitarianism, and that there is now an inter-state, overt attempt to suppress resistance (Assange, Dotcom, Anakata, etc.) with extreme media coverage to try to influence the rest of us.<p>Where are we to go? How are we to resist? There is the west and its fall-in-line economic treadmill, or the hinterlands and their available extra-judicial means of extradition (ala Anakata) or oppression. Assange&#x27;s warning about a transnational dystopia seems ever-more pertinent. You know what I think after having met him? Anakata was trying to understand what&#x27;s going on in Europe and the world at large, and his heart was in the right place. It fits with his character. After all, his mother is an academic, he was raised to ask questions.<p>Those who question are unjustly treated... the system is the problem. We can use the internet to create change.

In the end they were never used mainly because cost outweighed benefits. Imagine, nuclear fuel contains about millionx the energy per mass of chemical fuel, and yet exhaust velocity is only 2x higher, and effective combined ISP of the stage (velocity change vs mass fraction assuming dead weight of stage being zero, and with gravity/ballistic losses subtracted) is only about 50% higher than state of the art chemical systems, at vastly higher cost and risks involved.

The point of the upward (upward only and not considering the atmosphere) acceleration to the desired location is to give the lower bound of the energy requirements. This is the baseline (baseline-1) and the rocket equation is as simple as possible.<p>In reality with an atmosphere and to put the object in orbit, the aerodynamics change and the energy requirement increases beyond the above baseline-1.<p>If you &quot;accelerate upward then turn 90 degrees and accelerate horizontally&quot;, you can calculate an energy requirement for that and it is easy. Only two vectors involved. That should give some limit (call it baseline-2). We should expect to do better than baseline-2, how better? A calculation using the diagonal of the vectors involved in baseline-2 should give us baseline-3.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t do better than baseline-3. Our launch designs and ingenuity should have an energy requirement between baseline-2 (this is bad, we are not thinking) and baseline-3 (this is maybe closer to ideal).<p>The rockets and shuttles do &quot;pitch-over manoeuvres&quot; to turn the straight upward acceleration into an elliptical acceleration.<p>* Note, I have not addressed the complications of the variations in atmospheric drag, but if it varies close to linearly along the vertical cross-sectional then how I think about it above does not change unless there is some other oversight.",1414749928

That&#x27;s exactly why coming out was (and still is) necessary.

In the West it largely achieved that goal (we&#x27;re not there yet, but consider where we started).

I have to say that I have been largely disappointed by the lack of quality that is available out there. Things like Magneto are just too big and clunky which appear to be over engineered and complicated. Other solutions such as Open Cart don&#x27;t seem to be much easier either. Surely in 2014 there has to be a better, more modern platform than these?<p>The only option I&#x27;ve found that I really like is Shopify as its really user friendly and allows me to build templates quickly. The only problem with Shopify is that you have to pay and its not open source to host on my clients servers etc.<p>I wanted to reach out to the Hacker News community and see what your thoughts on the subject are and if you know of any solutions that work well for you?",1414749612
