Take the case of collectible gain tax, if you do not have evidence to prove the value of the item on the date it was acquired, then the IRS calculates the tax based on the total value of the item, not just the profit. So if you buy something that might increased in value at a later date, you better keep the receipt.<p>And of course, anytime the government freezes your asset and property, it takes a tremendous amount of time and effort to get it back.

Currently, on iOS, there is no NFC API at all; you might be able to accomplish something similar with iBeacon, but you can&#x27;t replicate Apple Pay&#x27;s single-touch flow (AFAIK, you&#x27;d have to swipe the notification, fingerprint to unlock, and then fingerprint <i>again</i> to confirm payment once the app had launched).  Now, Apple is not a monopoly, and admittedly this is all brand new - opening up the secure element would be an implementation challenge, and it&#x27;s <i>possible</i> that a new extension point will be added for lockscreen NFC handling in a future version, although not adding it would be nothing out of the ordinary for Apple.

I&#x27;m the physicist on the group, and we have considered the problem of background IR radiation. We can overcome this problem is a couple ways: First we&#x27;re using sub millisecond laser pulses so that while still being eye safe are much brighter than the background.

8509457,comment,8509271,8509312,0,0,benbreen,,,"I&#x27;m a medical historian and I think about this all the time - it&#x27;s a more complex question than it initially appears to be. The typical line of reasoning is to assume that medical treatments &quot;progress&quot; through history as the efficacious ones win adherents and the ones that don&#x27;t work fall out of favor. The problem with this is that the most popular medical treatment in the European and Islamic world for 2,000 years (bleeding) was medically worthless (well, unless you happen to have very high blood pressure).<p>So were all premodern doctors idiots who couldn&#x27;t practice empiricism? Well, no - many of them are extremely intelligent, inquisitive people (people like Isaac Newton and Robert Boyle accepted bleeding as a treatment, so clearly &quot;they weren&#x27;t smart&quot; or &quot;they didn&#x27;t understand the scientific method&quot; isn&#x27;t a good explanation).  I think the answer is two pronged. One is simply that the placebo effect is extremely powerful, so even cures that we consider not to be efficacious in a clinical setting still &quot;worked&quot; in daily practice as placebos. The second is to look more closely at what someone with the scientific mind of Robert Boyle made of bleeding. He actually did do quasi-experimental trials involving blood loss and concluded that &quot;excessive&quot; bleeding was bad for human health. By the same token, he started doing chemical assays of various mineral and animal-based cures (like eating burnt lizards for epilepsy, and things like that) and began to lay the foundations for our later (18th/19th century) understanding of which minerals and vitamins are essential for human health. It&#x27;s entirely possible that Greco-Roman doctors were doing similar things, but Boyle had the benefit of the ready dissemination of his findings via print and the world&#x27;s first scientific journal (Philosophical Transactions), which happened to be edited by his close associate (Henry Oldenberg).<p>In short I think there was a kind of practical empiricism at work in the history of medicine that has always existed. But that it didn&#x27;t begin to coalesce into clinical effective treatments until print culture made it possible for people to share their findings on a global level. This wasn&#x27;t a simple march out of ignorance toward truth, though. And the reason for this is that the placebo effect of remedies like bleeding often &quot;worked&quot; just as well as the partially-effective treatments of premodern times, like, for instance, supplementing poor diets by eating the ashes of various animal and plant products.",1414272392

8509452,comment,8507632,8508280,0,0,Bahamut,,,"Angular is meant for complex application development.<p>For example, say you want to create an online assessment player for taking exams.  You need a service that can maintain state for the whole application (example: time elapsed, which questions the person got right/wrong, etc.), and then you need highly modular question components that can plug into a common question model to generate common answer objects for answer submission, display of common question elements such as the question #, etc.<p>Say you were then handed requirements that you needed to support taking some assessments while offline and submit the answers as soon as the user goes back online (say for a self-study assessment and not a high stakes exam).  All of this then has to be completed in two months, and from scratch since it would be impossible with the previous code.<p>From my experience, Angular has facilitated meeting these deadlines with each team I have been on (my example is a real world experience of mine) & allowed companies I have worked at to maintain a high level of quality - the clients have raved about the quality of the applications.  Part of this is because Angular has allowed the companies I have been at to think about high level architecture, but the other half has been with the ease of unit testing with Angular.  I have no doubt that other companies can tout similar experiences with [insert framework here], which only serves to emphasize that team work is more important than developer opinions - if most of your team prefers doing something [insert different way] & it doesn&#x27;t have huge technical ramifications, then it&#x27;s worth deviating from your opinions to the different way in order to keep things moving.",1414272282

The general cyberpunk point of view is just a radical departure from the established line of thought (and forecasting). 
The fun thing to do when reading a cyberpunk novel is to watch for things that stay similar. And there are quite a lot. Actually, if you start pulling apart the shockingly weird things that are depicted (like for example, the SF-Oakland bridge becoming a shantytown) you notice that in the end society still works by the same rules as it does now.

What I think it boils down to, though, is that dystopias offer more narrative possibilities and stylistic choices for writers/filmmakers than do utopias. Utopian societies just aren&#x27;t that fun to fictionalize, even though they&#x27;re more fun to live in.

To work around this, the author restricts his searches to compile-time constant sequence lengths so that GCC can unroll the fixed-size binary searches into short, fixed, linear series of branchless conditional move instructions.  That setup executes reliably faster than optimized linear searches for in-cache sequences of size 8, 16, 32 and 64.<p>However, if the data is uncached, then memory latency dominates ALU execution time and the memory prefetcher&#x27;s preference for forward, linear scans leads to linear searches being faster than branches binary because of the difference in memory access patterns.  Interestingly, the behavior of the prefetcher on the author&#x27;s machine appears to prefer forward scans over backward scans at a sub-cache-line level.",1414271032

They&#x27;re wealthy is spite of being low earners -- in other words they play solid economic defense and often have a weaker economic offense than many. There are a lot of people driving BMWs who can&#x27;t afford them, and the economic crises revealed a ton of people over-leveraged on mortages. Now, in that case there&#x27;s certainly a strong argument that people were taken advantage of, and inequality is a really big problem -- I&#x27;m just not convinced the status game is something that must be played.

The functions look this way: Amplitude* sine(x* freq)<p>-So you have your sines and cosines at various frequencies and you wonder what the amplitudes should be for every one o them so that if we add them all up we end up with the original function<p>-The idea to answer this question is to see how values of your sine or cosine correlate with values of original function. If it turns out that the original function is high in value when your sine/cosine is high in value then sine/cosine at this frequency needs to have higher weight than sine/cosine at other frequency where it doesn&#x27;t correlate well with original function. Intuitively if you take functions which correlate well with original one with higher weight and those which doesn&#x27;t with lower weight then you will have good approximation of the original function.<p>-Euler formula tells you what sine and cosine at given point are representing it as one complex number; to get value of sine/cosine at frequency different than 1 you need to multiple the argument by k*2PI (as frequency is given in beats/period and period is 2PI it&#x27;s quite obvious why); So e^(xi) is value of cosx and sinx and e^(xik2PI) is value of those functions at frequencies different than 1.<p>So now let&#x27;s see what this formula is:<p>-it&#x27;s an average of things (1/N and a sum of N elements)<p>-those things are multplications of values of sine/cosine at given frequency at given point with value of original function at this point<p>-this average is going to be high if places where sine/cosine at given frequency is high and original function is high overlap (you multiple big number by big number) and low if described correlation is low; that&#x27;s the concept of correlation<p>-the points are evenly spaced from 0 to n-1 (that&#x27;s why n/N in the formula) and the sum goes over them.<p>That&#x27;s it. No circles and spinning. The only trick is to realize that:
e^(ix) represent value of sine and cosine at x and e^(ixk2PI) represents value of sine/cosine at frequency k (if k is 1, then it&#x27;s standard sine/cosine as everything simplifies).<p>One sentence explanation could be: the more sine/cosine at given frequency correlates with original function the more that sine/cosine contribute to the original function.",1414270837
