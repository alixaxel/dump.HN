For touch devices screen size is important even beyond having more context for what you are doing. Since it is also your interface you get larger buttons to press, thereby increasing the speed of your interaction.

8475707,comment,8474824,8475574,0,0,harshreality,,,"If the MITM proxy can rip apart SSL then SSL is broken (or the client trusts bad CAs).  What&#x27;s an example of where pinning a SSL session, one that&#x27;s been established securely, to a client IP prevents an attack?  If SSL is broken, trying to restrict sessions to the IP that initiated them is inadequate security, isn&#x27;t it?<p>(Arguably it&#x27;s useful to associate a session with a client IP for <i>unencrypted, http, connections</i>, since in that case cookies can be intercepted passively on the wire, and an attacker can try to reuse those cookies from clients with different IPs, since knocking the real client off the LAN to steal that IP might not be desirable since it could be detected.  But a basic assumption with properly functioning, secure SSL connections is that <i>no third party can steal session cookies to begin with</i> other than due to a client or server compromise which IP restrictions won&#x27;t help with.)<p>What you&#x27;re mitigating against seems to be only this: an attacker capable of MITMing SSL sessions and capable of stealing session cookies passively from legitimate sessions, but only able to establish connections to the real server from some other public IP, not the client&#x27;s actual public IP.  I don&#x27;t understand how that could be the case.<p>Serving a blank page or rejecting connections to port 80 still doesn&#x27;t help, does it?  The security vulnerability appears whenever the client even <i>attempts</i> a port 80 connection, since a MITM proxy will happily accept it and MITM it to the real https site.  Once a client gets the HSTS header that attack is prevented, but the first contact is always a risk, and I don&#x27;t see how refusing to support http on the server mitigates that.",1413650993

To begin, Dowd (the CTO of NSA) is not an irreplaceable commodity or even particularly qualified relative to his peers. He is however a very close personal friend of the former Director of NSA - who is now competing for contracts awarded by NSA - and in his CTO position retains a massive influence over what technologies get adopted and what contracts get awarded with NSA&#x27;s ~$10b a year budget. On top of this already obviously disqualifying conflict of interest, the NSA is handicapped with a part-time, 20-hour-a-week CTO in the midst of the largest intelligence scandal in the NSA&#x27;s history.<p>Beyond this, Keith Alexander, who supported Dowd in his pursuit of the CTO position, just began a company that competes solely based on his former NSA assocation (the desire to benefit from decisions informed by classified knowledge) and personal patents that he alleges sprang fully formed from his head during his time at NSA but were in no way influenced or produced as a result of his classified knowledge.<p>Alexander has lost direct access to current classified information as a result of terminating his ties to the NSA. However, as a result of this scheme, he can retain access to that information by having the HIGHEST RANKED TECHNOLOGY OFFICIAL AT THE NSA on his personal payroll with a perfect 50/50 time split.

But yes, that&#x27;s a significant problem with appealing to this sort of attitude outside of this 4D world (you have to invent some notion of time which applies to souls but not matter).<p>It is true that you can &quot;step back&quot; from the world-line and insist that every part of it is conscious, but that takes a really radical position on our own conscious experience of the progression of time, one that&#x27;s actually distinctively Buddhist, if you can believe it. (There&#x27;s a lot of Buddhist speculation about how the mind is a series of &quot;aggregates&quot; rather than one temporal whole; the idea is that you are no more identifiable with the you-of-twenty-seconds-ago than a candle&#x27;s flame as it has exhausted a new quantity of vaporized oil: in a metaphorical sense we say that both &quot;are the same&quot; but we don&#x27;t really mean much by it.<p>In general though, saying that &quot;the whole worldline is conscious&quot; abdicates our notion completely that time progresses, and instead says it&#x27;s all illusory (we have a local sense of progression even though nothing progresses). I think that the reason that this is unpopular is simply because if such an illusion exists, it has an interesting asymmetry with other illusions: you can&#x27;t actually shake it. (It has some other problems, like: it&#x27;s hard to see why natural selection would assemble those world-lines into something which have these feelings, given that they don&#x27;t seem to do anything -- and of course natural selection becomes just a metaphor to describe a pattern in how the lines are structured, rather than a force which changes the world, so it&#x27;s hard even to phrase the question much less answer it.)",1413650102

I had just graduated college and before that had been working hourly part-time and internships and was thrilled moving onto a salaried full-time position calculated at basically the same rate as what I had been earning.<p>About a year into the job I accidentally came across a piece of private paperwork a less experienced co-worker left on the shared printer that had her salary on it. It was almost twice what I was making!<p>I started a campaign to fix this discrepancy. I started keeping track of every task I performed, even little one-off tasks, and <i>also</i> the impact that completion of that task had. I often found that the tiny half-hour one-off tasks I was taking care of without a second thought were generating huge returns on efficiency for my company. A simple script that turned a 40 hour a week copy-and-past data entry job that was eating into corporate overhead into a 30 second run-once-a-week thing was freeing up an employee to work on higher billable hour tasks. I was not only saving the company money, but making it money by pinpointing and automating problems in their business processes.<p>The next evaluation period I walked in with a 20 page print out of every task I had worked on in the last year, what it was, and how it had impact on the company&#x27;s bottom-line. I asked for as big of a pay raise as company policy would allow.<p>It worked, and it continues to work everywhere I go. Having an irrefutable record of your value to the company makes it impossible for them to turn you down. And when they do, you now have an excellent archive to use for resume filler when you go looking for your next job.<p>Things I never do:<p>- threaten to go somewhere else if they don&#x27;t give me the raise, this is implicit. If they don&#x27;t give it to you, leave the company. Simple as that. No threats. Managers don&#x27;t like it and it&#x27;s just as likely to backfire on you. I guarantee they&#x27;ll muddle along somehow without you.<p>- get upset, what employees are paid is a complex business that you can only ever really understand when you&#x27;re in the position to be paying them. Sometimes you&#x27;ll end up getting paid less than an employee in a similar position. It sucks, but sometimes there&#x27;s reasons for it that you aren&#x27;t privy to. Don&#x27;t compare your pay to others too much, compare it to yourself and where you want to be.<p>- demand pay that exceeds what you should be making in that position in that industry. It sucks, but if you work phone tech support or are a receptionist, you&#x27;re not going to be making $250k/yr. If you want to make that kind of money, ask what the requirements are for that job then pursue them. Hold the company to that claim. When you fulfill those requirements, if they don&#x27;t pay-up, move on. Congratulations you are now qualified for a better job at a competitor.<p>- take a raise, then quit immediately. I feel this is a point of honor, if I make a big fuss and my manager goes through a lot of trouble to get a silver bullet for me, I feel like I&#x27;ve just made at least 12 month commitment to them. You&#x27;d be surprised at how important this has been for me career-wise many years later. I&#x27;ve had old managers who&#x27;ve hired me back at new companies (or give me open offers) just because I stuck around after they put their neck on the line for me, even when the work environment sucked. As a manager it can be difficult justifying huge percentage pay increases for your people (my 20 page list of completed tasks usually helped them significantly).<p>- ask for it based on need. &quot;I need to make more money to make my rent&quot;.

Those not immediately in agreement with any anti-NSA sentiment seem to be ridiculed or personally attacked for their ideas.  Such behavior is usually a sign that we&#x27;re treading into &quot;What You Can&#x27;t Say&quot; territory; hence, the throwaway.<p>As for my comment:  I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s wrong with the arrangement presented in the article.  Would someone please give concrete examples of (realistic) scenarios where this would be extremely detrimental to the US, or at least more harmful than the current arrangement of contracting private firms to perform government work?<p>Is your position that when the government brings in a whole company from the private sector to do work, then that&#x27;s perfectly fine, but when they bring in an individual, it&#x27;s not?  Why?  All of the same safeguards seem to be in play.<p>Also, having a risk of conflict of interest is different from having a conflict of interest.<p><i>He said he understood it had been approved by all the necessary government authorities, and that IronNet Cybersecurity, not the government, would pay for Dowd&#x27;s time spent with the firm.<p>Dowd, he said, wanted to join IronNet, and the deal was devised as a way to keep Dowd&#x27;s technological expertise at least partly within the U.S. government, rather than losing him permanently to the private sector.</i><p>Seems straightforward to me. The US government needs technically competent people, and they wanted to keep this technically competent person.  The arrangement was approved by all necessary authorities.<p>You can hold one of two viewpoints:  The NSA is necessary, or the NSA is unnecessary.  It seems pretty hard to argue that it&#x27;s unnecessary.  And if it&#x27;s necessary, then surely it&#x27;s also necessary for them to have highly competent people.  (Would you rather an extremely powerful organization have extremely competent people, or incompetent people?)  So if competent people are being lost to the private sector, then why <i>not</i> make special arrangements to retain their talent in some capacity?",1413648504

We could argue about whether that should be a lot or not, but in the current market it really is.<p>2) Timing is a bit difficult on this - with most Kickstarters, people are ok with getting it &quot;whenever&quot; - sometime in the medium-term future is fine for a widget or a computer game. For your app, I&#x27;d want it ready the day by kid is born - no sooner (if it&#x27;s subscription) and no later (I&#x27;d miss some events). So it&#x27;s a tough thing to back in advance.
