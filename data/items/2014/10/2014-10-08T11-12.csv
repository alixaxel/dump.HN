Expose how the trolls (or that particular troll) use any kind of story that they can construct, be it misogyny, misandry, censorship, whatever people at large hate or fear, to construct polarizing narratives aimed at damaging individual people.<p>I response to your implied question why this is perceived as much more interesting than an older submission of a talk by Anita Sarkeesian (which I didn&#x27;t watch, I&#x27;m just extrapolating here), it&#x27;s because it separates out the ideology part from the description of the trolling phenomenon.

And that the difficulty of moderating such discussions is why Hackernews doesn&#x27;t even try to be welcoming to discussions that are or look ideological. Let&#x27;s put it this way: the moderators here have a good track record for creating a pleasant, constructive discussion around technical stuff (including Windows and Linux and upstart and systemd and a host of contentious issues) and around business/startup stuff. As we find out how to have a constructive, non-polarizing, non-troll-prone discussion about other issues (global economy, misogyny/misandry, whatever), these things will be received more positively on Hackernews.

A frequent setup is that you have a longer-term project that&#x27;s <i>really</i> interesting but not deadline-pressing, so you can only work on it when you&#x27;ve gotten other immediate things out of the way first. There are attempts to try to explicitly make schedule space for the interesting long-term work (like Google&#x27;s 20% time), but it still often ends up that you have to get a bunch of other less-interesting stuff off your plate each day or week, before you can get to the best stuff.",1412768860

There are lot of implicit contracts made, and breaking some of them could be recognized in court (there&#x27;s the concept of acting in bad faith).<p>In this particular case, JenLaw et al. have all the rights to be mad at Apple because of the broken ToS/implicit contract that said &quot;this is my data, it&#x27;s only backed up and will not be shown to third parties&quot;.

8426384,comment,8420274,8422717,0,0,eksith,,,"I ran a forum on SQLite for a few years before switching to Postgres fairly recently. This is not due to any shortcoming of SQLite, which I believe could have handled far more traffic than what we were already getting at the time (6K - 10K unique hits per day), but it allowed us to have nicer search features.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t know the upper limit of users you can support concurrently, but with modern hard drives, I imagine it&#x27;s an order of magnitude beyond this. It has more to do with your application code than the database in my experience.<p>I had an informal rule: Read early, write late. When the visitor first hits the page, I&#x27;ll read for the first queries and only write to the database after I&#x27;ve sent the response back to the user. Writes are always the slowest, but no where near as slow as the network so the visitor never had to sit and wait for writes.<p>The thing is, a lot of the criticisms of SQLite didn&#x27;t actually apply if you limit the number of writes to < 10 and queries < 50 per hit and keep everything on one server. It&#x27;s only when you try to write across the network a lot of the locking issues and such come up. Also, by 3.7, there was Write Ahead Logging (WAL) which was perfect timing as that allowed us to skip the DIY write queue entirely.",1412768773

Placing the question of whether or not their products continue to work in the hands of third parties?<p>I think there is a conversation to be had here about the proper way to tie add-on services (which are inevitable) with one-time-purchase products. Consumers want some indication of whether they can reach the Internet, but this really requires some ongoing cost on the router manufacturer&#x27;s part, which cannot be recouped indefinitely from a one-time hardware sale.<p>we face a similar crisis in mobile apps. Apps increasingly require backend services to provide core functionality, which just isn&#x27;t sustainable indefinitely with a fixed-price model. Inevitably when these companies are acquired, the backend shuts down, and people lose the product that they &quot;paid&quot; for.<p>I think in the long-term, we are going to have to move to a subscription-based model where people are paying regularly for things they used to buy one-off.

Apple is also in a similar position again trying to drive purchases to its own store.<p>At the same time, regulatory action on competition has been more focused on contractual terms and price collusion/fixing than on interoperability; regulators will probably want to wait a while after sorting that mess out to observe whether they see competition acting effectively or not before addressing interoperability in ebooks.<p>For the same pressures and reasons to cause DRM to be dropped from ebooks, I think it will take an outside competitor (probably a new entrant) without a significant stake in hardware AND with substantial buying power to break this cycle.

A strong debate between strong positions is healthier than an artificial social force reverting everyone back to mean.<p>I agree in principle, but the fact that there are good arguments on either side of the debate, and neither of them has been able to conclusively prove that one approach is decidedly better than the other, turns the debate into an argument over preference rather than absolutes, which is a very different kind of debate.<p>But I would even say something stronger: when it comes to programming languages, much (if not most or even practically all) of the arguments must eventually come down to psychology. If a programming language that can produce no bugs and still express useful programs were ever to be created, if that language is hard for people to use (because of human psychology), or even if people <i>don&#x27;t like</i> using it -- I would say that that language is nearly useless, except for research purposes or maybe some domains where this property is important over all others (say, safety-critical embedded systems). So even if there is a &quot;right answer&quot; like you imply, the debate is in the realm of psychology -- not math or computer science -- and psychology, as we all know, does not usually yield hard answers even when it has answers at all. So while studying the properties of programming languages is computer science, their overall utility is (almost) purely within the realm of the social sciences.<p>To repeat an example I&#x27;ve made a few times, if your job is to catch a ball you can&#x27;t argue that teaching you to compute the ball&#x27;s trajectory with a Newtonian formula is better than practicing a few times simply because the former is more mathematically rigorous. Which is best depends on which approach better fits your psychology.<p>So here&#x27;s my strong position: if someone debating programming languages denies that their general utility is mostly a matter of psychology rather than math, <i>then that person is wrong!</i>",1412767740

My position is that it is no longer a useful approach, as the actual behaviour of modern processors has diverged so much from Cachegrind&#x27;s simple simulation.  Instead, I think it is much more productive to use tools like &#x27;perf&#x27; that use the CPU&#x27;s built in performance counters to measure the actual performance.<p>My conviction inspired me to repeat Richard&#x27;s test to see how the numbers compared when run on a current Haswell i7-4770 processor.   Here&#x27;s what I got for the versions he compared when compiled with GCC 4.8.1 and using &#x27;perf stat speedtest1 --size 5&#x27;[1] (sizes are for the sqlite.o lib only):<p><pre><code>  Cachegrind per Richard:
  3.8.7a -Os: 953,861,485 cycles
  3.7.17 -Os: 1,432,835,574 cycles

  Haswell:
  3.8.7 -O3: 469,956,519 cycles (870,767,673 instructions, 1,069,032 bytes)
  3.8.7 -Os: 542,228,740 cycles (884,541,860 instructions, 648,360 bytes)

  3.17.7 -O3: 651,680,545 cycles (1,320,867,830 instructions, 1,002,192 bytes)
  3.17.7 -Os: 771,304,471 cycles (1,406,527,795 instructions, 605,976 bytes)
</code></pre>
One can make of the numbers what you will, but here are some conclusions I drew:<p>While the improvement is about the same magnitude that Richard sees, the actual number of cycles is off by about a factor of 2.<p>Despite having a larger binary, and thus theoretically worse instruction cache behavior, -O3 beats -Os by about 20% in speed in both cases, at a cost of 40% (400K/1MB) in size.<p>&#x27;perf record -F100000 speedtest1 --size 5; perf report&#x27; is a really slick and easy way to figure out where the program is spending it&#x27;s time.   If I were optimizing this, I remain fairly certain it would be more a more effective approach than using Cachegrind.<p>[1] I had to comment out the &quot;sqlite3_rtree_geometry_callback&quot; line in speedtest1.c to get it to compile, which might affect my numbers slightly, but from the source comments I don&#x27;t think it was actually being used.",1412767102

Rather than being memory-only, it would be nice if the weight of keeping them around could be palmed off to the browser using cookies or hidden fields.<p>To be practical, it would require that the activation record chain kept alive by the closure is reasonably short, that the number of live variables in the chain is fairly small, and there be a reliable way of mapping code references in and out. But I think it can be done.<p>One of these days, I&#x27;m going to implement a toy language with this feature combined with my other favourite, automatically recalculated data flow variables (think: &quot;variables&quot; that work like spreadsheet cells).

During the last few years (and amplified by the economic crisis) people have been growing weary of their actions and general perception of impunity. Podemos is a young political party born as a reaction to that.<p>Here [1], you can see the last official government polls (from July 14), where the declining trend for major political parties is very clear, and Podemos as a new party is the 3rd most popular option. The next polls should confirm the trend, but the general feeling in Spain is that Podemos is still growing in popularity.<p>Note: I&#x27;m originally from Spain, although not currently living there.<p>edit: This additional poll from Sept 29th [2] (in Spanish) confirms the Podemos rising trend I was referring to.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/08/04/media/1407160041_786585.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/08/04/media/1407160041_786585....</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.lasexta.com/noticias/nacional/pierde-puntos-intencion-voto-pero-sigue-siendo-opcion-preferida_2014100600139.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lasexta.com/noticias/nacional/pierde-puntos-inten...</a>",1412766485
8426277,comment,8424696,8425967,0,0,arrrg,,,"Warranties can be tied to limitations and restrictions the manufacturers make up. (There probably are some limitations to that to do with contract law. It surely is quite complicated, but voiding your warranty by unlocking your device doesn’t seem unreasonable to me.)<p>Warranties are voluntary and distinct from seller liability for defects in the product. That liability is legally required in the EU. The details of the implementation are different in different countries.<p>In Germany it’s like this: The seller (and only the seller) is liable and you have to go to the seller to make a liability claim. So if you bought your phone from Amazon you have to write Amazon, not Motorola. If you bought it from a carrier you have to go to the carrier. If you didn’t buy the phone directly from the manufacturer that manufacturer doesn’t have to do anything when you come to them with a defect phone. It’s the seller’s problem. (This is mostly to prevent a runaround, where seller and manufacturer both tell you each other is responsible for fixing the problem. This creates one entity that is clearly and obviously responsible and has to handle the problem.)<p>It’s for defects present when the device was sold and that’s it. (However, subsequent defects of some component because the device was delivered with some faulty or not up to spec components count, too.)<p>In the first six months the seller has to prove the defect wasn’t present when the device was delivered to not be liable. You, the buyer, don’t have to prove anything. That burden of proof, however, reverses after six months and up to 24 months (then there is no more liability), making it very hard in practice for buyers to prove after those six months that the defect was there when the device was sold. (However, courts have relaxed the requirements for that. Buyers usually don’t need to get some expensive expert opinion or something like that. If you can make a very good and informed argument for your case you should usually be covered.)<p>The seller can repair or replace the device. Buyers don’t have right to get their device replaced when it’s possible to repair it. If repairing and replacing fails a number of times (I think three) the buyer can demand their money back.<p>That’s the liability. A legal requirement and very complicated – and also wholly distinct from warranties.<p>By unlocking your phone you may have voided your warranty, but you certainly didn’t void the legal liability of the seller.",1412766462
