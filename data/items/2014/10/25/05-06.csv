Empathy has all sorts of known biases - we feel more empathy for people like us, attractive people, etc. In the west, for example, we have less empathy for black people:<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108582/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3108582/</a><p><a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0048546"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone...</a><p>Furthermore, even in the absence of easily predicted biases, emotional reactions are simply nondeterministic. There is no reason to believe they will converge to anything useful.<p>In contrast, principle-based morality doesn&#x27;t have this flaw. If you take a principled position that poking people with a needle is bad (to borrow the example of the first paper), then it doesn&#x27;t matter if you are poking a black or white person - the abstract principle of &quot;don&#x27;t poke people with a needle&quot; is sufficient.<p>I realize this idea certainly bothers people who take personal pride in feeling empathy, who make it part of their identity.

It has happened plenty of times before. There were other hominid species before and during the time Homo Sapiens appeared, we still carry some of their genes but they are extinct. Why would we suppose our particular species will be any different? Life is succession of organisms. And it doesn&#x27;t seem the function of life is to preserve species, but rather to preserve and enhance genes.<p>Oh I know... Being human, I&#x27;m not crazy about the idea either.
