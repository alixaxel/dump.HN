Brooklyn Brew Shop sells one gallon brew kits, but if you already have brewing supplies, the only thing you would need to add is a one gallon carboy (I buy the gallon jugs of wine at the supermarket, and then just re-use the jugs).<p>I brew both 5 gallon batches and 1 gallon batches (mostly for experimentation).  TO keep the costs down on the gallon batches, I use washed yeast and hops leftover from other recipes.  The cool thing about the gallon batches is you can squeeze in an all-grain brew in an evening on a weekday, but  the obvious downside is it only yields ~9 beers, which I find to be too small a yield for the amount of effort.  Also, if you already have a wort chiller, you won&#x27;t save that much time compared to a 5 gallon extract brew.<p>If you are dead set on all grain, others on this thread have mentioned the brew-in-the-bag method.  It looks like you just steep the grains (using a really big mesh bag).  It looks like this method gets you about 3 gallons, but if you already have a bunch of equipment, you could probably adapt this method to 5 gallons.",1413842182

There is a massive psychological barrier to buying &quot;only&quot; a single bitcoin for ~$400, and most laypeople wouldn&#x27;t think to assume they are divisible (after all, it&#x27;s a &quot;coin&quot;, and real coins are never split). And for whatever reason, evaluating costs intuitively becomes incredibly difficult when the decimal is on the right side; I know the difference between $100 and $1000 much better than the difference between 0.01 BTC and 0.001 BTC.<p>However: I&#x27;ve grown skeptical that the developed world will ever price things natively in Bitcoins, regardless of sub-units. Not because of volatility: over time, that will be addressed by shorts/hedges/etc, and a larger liquidity pool.<p>Rather, the obstacle is social momentum and pricing psychology. While we all pay a slow and subtle inflation tax, we generally develop an intuitive sense of what a dollar is worth. As anyone who has travelled and used foreign currencies can tell you, having to constantly do conversion math means throwing that knowledge away, and constantly wondering if you&#x27;re getting ripped off. Simply put, no one wants to abandon their lifetime of experience with gauging value and prices by switching to an arbitrary new unit.<p>I&#x27;m still bullish on Bitcoin and crypto-assets in general, but as (a) a pure-tech, worldwide middleman between fiat and fiat, (b) a way to bootstrap financial infrastructure for the third world and the unbanked, and (c) a backbone for other applications and services, with colored coins and proof-of-existence being two prototypical examples.<p>As for driving down the street and seeing 0.009 BTC (or even 0.9 Beans) for a gallon of gas, I&#x27;m not holding my breath.",1413841496

Efficiency could be a very good measure of the quality of the product and the design, however, A highly efficient process could be worse than a less efficient one, in the case where you are accomplishing a task which is done rarely and the user needs more guidance than average.<p>We are having that issue with an Alpha product we just released this week. The main dev (who has more experience with IOS than the rest of us) thought he had designed a process that other IOS devs would find easy. Us other internal testers were told &quot;you don&#x27;t know how to do it because you&#x27;re not an IOS dev&quot;, and we accepted that, until we got feedback from a few other users that they didn&#x27;t know how to find/do certain things. The fix, an inefficient process that walks users through step-by-step.<p>If you were to do a video comparing the old version to the new, the old version is far quicker, for somebody who knows what they are doing (and the creator), but nearly impossible and hours long for the rest of us.

Since water and sewer fees are coupled, I assume that&#x27;s one reason why the city had a problem.)<p>The proximate &quot;okay&quot; part is that the local authorities decided it. The secondary &quot;okay&quot; part is that the local electorate voted for those authorities. After all, at some point that requirement wasn&#x27;t there.<p>It&#x27;s hard to point to every single thing and say &quot;I won&#x27;t pay it unless I use it.&quot; If someone doesn&#x27;t own a vehicle, then why should they pay for highway taxes for roads they can&#x27;t bike or walk on? If someone is afraid of flying and will never fly, why do they pay taxes that go to the FAA?<p>Another solution could be to raise everyone&#x27;s taxes to be exactly the connection fee for the power company, and have the city pay the power company. Her bill would be $0, but the profits would be the same.<p>We&#x27;ve decided to have direct payments instead of indirect ones.<p>One might argue that the utility access to the house constitutes trespass, and without the need for connection there&#x27;s no need for trespass. This is a sort of feudal view of the land. The flip side is to say that one bought the land with certain rights of access in place, and the landowner can&#x27;t make one-sided changes. I believe in the latter.<p>BTW, it can&#x27;t really really be that the residents decide. If I rent, and don&#x27;t want to pay power, can I tell the power company to disconnect? Or the water company? Will the city then cap the sewer lines and withdraw the water and power? That sure makes it harder for the owner to find a new renter.<p>Nor can it be the owner alone who decides. Some of these laws are in place to prevent slumlords, who provide substandard housing.

Our two-year-old daughter went running out to meet Mommy.  Then a car came flying around the corner (since we lived at the top of a T intersection, that means that the car was <i>right there</i>.)  We both yelled at our daughter to stop.  She did, and the car went past.<p>Two houses later, the car ran over a cat.  I went up to see if there was anything I could do.  There wasn&#x27;t, but I got to see what the underside of a cat&#x27;s head looks like after a car has run over the top side.<p>I will do almost anything to have that not happen to my daughter&#x27;s head.<p>But the problem is, my two-year-old daughter can&#x27;t understand what 3000 pounds of car at 30 MPH are going to do to her.  It&#x27;s totally outside of her comprehension.  Yes, we can tell her that playing in the road hurts, but there&#x27;s no way she can really get it.<p>But she can learn that, when Mommy or Daddy tell me to stop and I don&#x27;t, it hurts every single time.  (The consistency is important.  Most of the time, it doesn&#x27;t matter at all if she doesn&#x27;t stop when I tell her, it merely annoys me.  But once in a while, <i>it really matters</i>.

Definitely.  But when my children were young, I spanked them to teach them that disobedience hurts.

Although tooling might not be there just yet, the linux meta distribution allows you to build a strict set of dependencies based on what you need and nothing else. There&#x27;s already been pretty successful attempts at this, such as <a href=""https://github.com/edannenberg/gentoo-bb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/edannenberg/gentoo-bb</a> (63mb custom nginx sound ok to you?) or <a href=""https://github.com/wking/dockerfile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wking/dockerfile</a>.<p>edit:
To elaborate for people not very familiar with gentoo; it solves what a lot of the discussion in this thread seems to be about - having complete control of the dependency chain based on how you choose to build your software. Using nginx as an example, enabling mod_security would pull and build its own dependencies (which also can be limited based on its compiler options). Strip man pages? Done. Change libc library? No problem (if the packages support it).<p>The work that needs to be done is expanding the toolset to a point where you say &quot;I want this in docker, plx&quot; and anything else (dependencies disregarded) basically goes out the window. The current attempts builds upon a small set of packages for convenience then removes &quot;safe&quot; stuff. When time allows, I&#x27;d like to be much more aggressive in terms of what&#x27;s considered safe.

For me the primary distractions are games and Reddit (although I&#x27;ve definitely gotten quite a bit of education and professional insights from Reddit so its not all bad).<p>As a huge gamer growing up, I didn&#x27;t think anything about unwinding by playing video games.

I think it stems from the fact that I&#x27;m now significantly aware of the various hooks that go into a game to extract more money or keep me playing longer.  It just killed some of the appeal.  Of course, I still sunk 3-4 hours into Mount & Blade: Warband multiplayer last night, and find that round-based multiplayer games without microtransactions still hold great appeal to me.<p>Ultimately though, as I grow older I find myself saying &quot;it&#x27;s ok if I want to play a game now to relax, but I need to be aware that it is a conscious tradeoff between doing something fun and mindless, and doing something less fun and productive.&quot;  Trying to teach myself how to code is hard work, and so it is a real mental battle for me to make myself do that sometimes, but will pay dividends down the line as I develop a new skill and gain more technical knowledge.<p>At the end of the day, the only one who can make me spend time doing something is myself, and once you realize your battle is with yourself and not with gaming, or TV, or any other distraction/vice, that is the first step to improvement.",1413840361

Whether people realize it or not, you don&#x27;t use us just so the don&#x27;t have to maintain email servers (that&#x27;s part of it), but also to make sure that the email they send ends up where it&#x27;s intended to go (most of the time).  That&#x27;s not just making sure all the SMTP rules are followed, DKIM/SPF/etc. are right, IPs are kept off RBLs, etc., etc.  Email hosts also look at the reputation of the email sender in determining whether to deliver to their customers.  Email senders have to walk a careful line with the ISPs (Google, Yahoo, Comcast, etc) who provide email to end users.  If an ESP sends too much email that tickles a spam filter at an ISP, the ISP will block the ESP, which is a major business hit.  Bonus: we rarely know what the thresholds are, and it changes all the time.  If we get blocked it can impact much more than one client, and we then have to negotiate with the ISP and convince them that we haven&#x27;t gone bad, we&#x27;re policing our clients, and pretty please let us send them mail.  We have an entire team of people (10+ folks) that do nothing but manage those relationships.  When this happens enough with a single client, even if they aren&#x27;t technically in the wrong, it&#x27;s a business decision as to whether the client is worth keeping.",1413840159

Per the above, unless you get a lucky hit on the central nervous system (CNS), people who get shot stop because they don&#x27;t want to get shot again (perhaps 1/2 of the criminals shot in the US), the rest when they&#x27;ve lost enough blood, which bigger wound channels, destroying more tissue, do a better job of.<p>If you just want to kill someone, pump a lot of holes in them all the way through, for which FMJ is best.  It&#x27;ll be much harder for anyone to patch them up before they die of blood loss.<p>I put it as a simple law: lethality scales with number of hits, stopping power with the diameter of the bullet.<p>Caveat: if you don&#x27;t luck out with a CNS hit or convincing the target he doesn&#x27;t want to get shot again, there&#x27;s a rather thin line between causing him to lose enough blood to stop fighting, and losing enough to die.
