Things I advise you to do and you will not do:<p>- Most importantly, go visit a professional, one who specializes in emotional intelligence. 
- Make sports more than half an hour a day every day. 
- Switch to a healthy diet, no snuff, no alcochol, and low in sugar. 
- Lower the workload or leave it for a few months. 
- Give yourself time, and changes of activities, places and people.<p>By doing these steps you will again be the same.

8491933,comment,8491651,8491651,0,0,tfinniga,,,"The conclusion about map generation is a bit naive.  Yes, if google&#x27;s self-driving car requires them, and google can&#x27;t currently produce them at scale, then maybe google&#x27;s current solution isn&#x27;t going to explode onto the marketplace.  But could the current solution be used in certain cities? (start with San Francisco, then expand city by city as the demand exists) Sure.  Could google come up with a different solution?  Sure.<p>There are other companies working on self-driving cars - BMW, Audi, Tesla, others.  The darpa grand challenges in 2005 and 2007 didn&#x27;t rely on this kind of detailed map data.<p>Will self-driving cars ever be able to handle all possible driving situations?  Probably not.  But humans can&#x27;t handle all driving situations either.  A more relevant question is whether self-driving cars will be better than human drivers.  It&#x27;s silly to say that we need strong AI for that, since we&#x27;ve already seen several prototype systems that do better than humans in many situations without strong AI.<p>The other thing that this conclusion ignores is what the changes to the road system might be.  If everyone gets semi-autonomous cars for commuting, and they work fine except for one intersection where people need to pay attention and negotiate it themselves, then there will be pressure to change the intersection.  Maybe besides the carpool lane, you might eventually get autonomous lanes.  It&#x27;s a bit chicken-and-egg, but if there is a system that is useful enough in some situations for people to buy, then it will progress from there.",1413967742

8491931,comment,8491576,8491841,0,0,gamegoblin,,,"You just have to change the way you think about the game. Rather than viewing the game as a wholistic &quot;Game&quot; object which changes state as the game progresses, view it instead as  a series of game states or frames which <i>are</i> immutable.<p>Then you define a function that is like (in C-ish):<p><pre><code>    GameState tick(GameState current, Action playerMove) {
        ... set up the next frame and return it ...
    }
</code></pre>
And a function to play like:<p><pre><code>    void play() {
        play(initialState());
    }

    void play(GameState current) {
        if(current.gameOver()) return;
        Action playerMove = getPlayerMove();
        GameState next = tick(current, playerMove);
        play(next); // In Haskell and C on higher optimizations, this tail recursive call will get compiled to a loop
    }

Of course it can get a bit more complicated depending on the context, but you get the idea.<p>So I&#x27;d say functional programming is neither better nor worse. A lot of people get hung up on the idea of immutability, but really I&#x27;ve found it to be a non-issue.",1413967684

It&#x27;s a 3000-pound chunk of metal that moves fast enough to kill anyone who comes into contact with it, and sometimes even those who ride in it. The ability to consult with a remote server would be nice, but the car should perform just as well even when a neighborhood prankster jams the cell & GPS signals.<p>So the entire approach of relying on a map might be misguided, regardless of whether the map is precompiled or JIT-crowdsourced. It seems that the current generation of autonomous vehicles rely too much on maps and too little on situational awareness. The next generation will need to make a lot of advances on the latter. Ideally, a car should be able to make all millisecond-by-millisecond decisions by itself, offline if necessary, and use the map only as a hint.",1413967051
