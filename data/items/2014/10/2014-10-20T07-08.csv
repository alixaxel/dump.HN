I also like the simplicity of the description, makes it really easy to understand the descision making process.<p>I think it is a very logical solution.

AMD <i>desperately</i> needs to adopt cutting edge processes, even if it costs them 50 percent more per chip than it would if it would wait a year or longer.<p>It&#x27;s bad enough that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be able to outcompete Intel in CPU design anymore, but it&#x27;s making the problem worse by not adopting a modern process, too (as modern as it can be, since Intel is already ahead of other foundries - although the gap will shrink a lot with the next-gen FinFET processes). That especially made it <i>impossible</i> for AMD to enter mobile or even ultrabooks, with AMD&#x27;s old processes and higher power consumption.<p>Fortunately, 1) GF is apparently licensing Samsung&#x27;s 14nm FinFET process, and 2) there&#x27;s a tiny rumor that AMD will be using it by the end of next year, which could be very early in the process&#x27; life.<p>AMD is preparing to announce new CPU micro-architectures for both x86 and ARMv8 in a couple of years.

I got the gig by going the extra mile.

8480995,comment,8476063,8476647,0,0,akzfowl,,,"I think India might be a better test case for any such study. Most Indians are forced to learn at last two languages and in several parts even three. I guess I cannot speak for the all the rural regions where learning just the local dialect of the state language would suffice but education in most tier-2 and metro cities is carried out in English in most places  and everybody knows it is the language they must learn if they are to enter the global marketplace at any point in their lives. Not everyone is equally fluent but they tend to know just about enough to communicate.
In North India, the most prevalent language is Hindi. And several of the other state languages are often related in some way to Hindi making them at least partially mutually intelligible. Like Punjabi and Marathi.
South India is a whole other matter. The four predominant languages there are quite different from the Northern ones. Some of them share different forms of similar words but each has its own script.
Having spent varying amounts of time growing up in Delhi, Madras, Madurai and Bangalore, I can speak, read and write in Hindi, Tamil and English. My fluency in each of these areas tends to vary but I can get by in any one of these alone. Also, through my interactions with friends and neighbours, I can understand bits and pieces of few other languages as well",1413789701

If I could learn everything by watching videos and listening to lectures then there are already thousands of high quality documentaries, TTC courses and so on. The thing is that we humans don&#x27;t learn subjects deeply just by watching bunch of videos but only by actually doing things.<p>For instance, there are probably 100s of videos and lectures on General Relativity out there. You can watch them endlessly and you would have some understanding of overall ideas but you would be at complete loss if someone takes simple exercise problems from any textbook and asks you to solve it. In other words, deep understanding doesn&#x27;t happen simply by watching phenomenal documentaries.<p>Major component that really matters in any academic programs is homework and exercises. This is what allows students to get deep insights in to subject and make sure they can actually put their learning in to action. It also allows professors to verify that they have actually crossed the line from shallow understanding to deep understanding. This is what you pay for when you go to college.

8480968,comment,8419658,8424815,0,0,TheTripPlanner,,,"Hi Folks..<p>Have been a dormant user of Ycombinator for some time. I have been researching on this topic for the last 4-5 years. To be really honest I think TripHobo.com does not fit SomeCallMeTim&#x27;s use case. I think Roadtrippers.com may fit the bill. Having said that, I am a big fan of TripHobo.com. I have seen the portal evolve for sometime and I see it as the closest solution to fixing travel planning 
I have my reasons here:
1) The only source which gives you draft itineraries created by other users. This is immensely useful as i can see what other are planning to my destination. I planned a trip to Rome using TripHobo.com and i find it immensely useful.. 
2) If you hit Plan my trip button, the TripPlanning functionality is awesome. You can add almost all attractions  in a city to your trip plan and you can hit the optimize button, you get an automated route planned. What TripHobo claims is that the route plans generated are not only optimized for distance but also for opening and closing times of attractions. I think this is really cool.
No one does it so easily.. not even google!  
3) The ease of usage: This is the most easy to use portal for trip planning.<p>Limitations: 
I think there is only one limitation as SomeCallMeTim pointed out..
Limited number of cities .. I counted the number of cities manually in August last year, i could find 171 cities to which i could plan trips to. I counted again on 5th october 2014 and i found that there were 243 cities. Today i saw that they have changed their interface to a search bar and hence I am not able to determine how many cities are enabled on Triphobo.com.. If they go on increasing the number of cities to which one can plan his/her trip to say 3000-4000 cities around the world.. i think TripHobo.com will have fixed travel planning for sure. My 2 cents!<p>I am also tracking folks like roadtrippers, mygola and tripomatic. To me these (along with TripHobo) are the leading 4 travel planning players today. MyGola has been a disappointment..Tripomatic is difficult to use..Roadtrippers and TripHobo are i think getting some serious traction .. Roadtrippers has primary focus on roadtrips whereas TripHobo is a holistic leisure travel solution if they are able to scale their content..",1413788628

Before MOOCs we still had all the textbooks authored by same professors which anyone can buy for less than $100 and learn the subject on their own.

And the time professors/TA spend in checking your homework.<p>The core thing to understand is that real learning doesn&#x27;t happen when you are listening to lectures but it happens when you are working on homework and doing exercises where you struggle through and occasionally have to go back to professor&#x27;s offices to get insight.<p>But the truth is that the price of education is mostly justified as &quot;certification service&quot;.
