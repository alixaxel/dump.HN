And we decided to forbid the construction of minarets, a sad low-point in the history of our democracy. But you know what? It keeps everyone involved and engaged in political matters. Because in principle anyone can make a proposal, collect enough signatures, and there will be a binding vote. The mentality is &quot;we control the government&quot;. Of course, there is still the manipulation of the masses, politicians prefer to re-interpret what we voted about (they aren&#x27;t allowed, but often there is some gray area and they can delay things), and sometimes a majority decision seems to be a very bad emotional one. But in contrary to Germany, people here feel more in control over the government, rather than being helpless observers. If you don&#x27;t like something, stop complaining and start collecting signatures. I&#x27;m usually not very patriotic, but if you want to take my direct vote away, you can pry it out of my dead hands.",1413615506

There are already concerns regarding the use of lithium, and whether its availability would be able to sustain global production (rechargeable batteries, mainly) in the next hundred years or so.<p>I gained a huge interest on piezoelectric materials upon learning of solar piezoelectric thermoacoustic generators.

No company would invest the billions, if not hundreds of billions of dollars, to solve this problem in the next few hundred years.<p>You&#x27;ve missed the point. Why would people watch a TV show and grow to love/hate characters, where there&#x27;s no interaction between you and them, and all the lines, actions and scenes are scripted and rehearsed. They certainly don&#x27;t have time to do it, and have children, partners, friends, parents. They would surely not binge watch, schedule time to watch new episodes come rain hail or shine or spend big bucks to visit filming locations etc.<p>Companies will invest stupid amounts of money in AI that has human qualities. Take the TV Show example: the AI is the &quot;show&quot; and each day they get into entertaining or emotional circumstances that you can &quot;catch up&quot; about, joke about etc. Their charisma is highly engineered to be incredibly engaging and fun to talk to, so you keep coming back for more. Over time they become a &quot;good friend&quot; that you love talking to. They never rebuff you, snub you, have no time for you, make fun of you (too much, just enough to joke around and have some banter).

In the US, if you&#x27;re switching carriers, you are probably throwing away your phone and getting a new (subsidized) one from your new carrier. Even if you are moving from a GSM to another GSM carrier, because of the subsidies the old SIM is probably locked to your old carrier and it might be cheaper to get a new, subsidized one anyway.",1413612823
