Why shift the fraud risk from the issuing bank to yourself?  There is zero benefit for the consumer here, and only helps the banks and merchants.<p>Yes, some banks will give you a &quot;zero fraud guarantee&quot; but I&#x27;d much rather 1) not have my bank account involved in a fraudulent transaction and 2) have the option of simply closing an account during a &quot;difficult customer service event&quot; and tell them to sue me if they think I&#x27;m lying.  Even using a debit card as a Visa/MC is much better than entering your PIN and using as debit.  No chance of someone stealing a PIN either.<p>Using a debit card removes most of your options as a consumer when dealing with fraud, and greatly expands your attack surface.  No thanks.<p>I actually don&#x27;t disagree with your premise, but vehemently disagree that using a debit card as a consumer has any benefit whatsoever to you.

I think Blythe, and many others, do this out of a hatred of themselves and their own lives -- a hatred amplified by social media. She admits to stealing her friend&#x27;s FB picture to use as her own, and if you look at the accounts linked to here, the picture is of a pretty attractive women. I&#x27;m willing to bet Blythe sees herself as unattractive, is constantly bombarded by photos of her attractive friends and their escapades, feels comparatively bad about herself, and reacts by creating a persona of who she wants to be, which would explain the pictures of her nonexistent trip to Greece.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the internet, particularly social media, is the reason these people exist, but I can&#x27;t help but feel that it has both worsened their pre-existing conditions and equipped them with a dangerous coping method.

A better general education might have some effect.  One doesn&#x27;t merely need the financial planning skill, one needs an incentive to apply it and to suffer the consequences.  Yes, I do mean suffer; for many people the facade they present to the world really matters.  Standing out from the crowd is a luxury that a lot of people cannot afford.  I can afford it because I am lucky enough to have skills that others will pay well for me to exercise.  Someone who&#x27;s only skill is efficient stacking of shelves in the local supermarket has less freedom of action.

At best, it&#x27;s a couple of terabytes, and most of the time, you are working with a small subset of it. Running KDB+ on a beefy server or two would usually do the job (rather well).<p>2.

One thing I would like to add is that there are two types of GPUDirect depending on CUDA versions. Previous CUDA supported GPUDirect through CPU memory, and now CUDA supports &quot;true&quot; GPUDirect between the RDMA device and the GPU memory. However, some chipsets may not support the &quot;true&quot; GPUDirect very well, and two of our old machines had up to 20x times of throughput asymmetry with GPUDirect (which is, send was much slower than recv.) There are several papers that discuss this limitation. Our work, GPUnet[1], overcame this performance issue with GPUDirect by using fairly recent chipsets, but you can probably imagine our pain when we saw around 150MB/s throughput with GPUDirect, when 3GB/s is the expected one.<p>[1] GPUnet: Networking Abstractions for GPU Programs, OSDI 2014\n<a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/silbersteinmark/GPUnet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sites.google.com/site/silbersteinmark/GPUnet</a>",1413663950

USB is polled, the Host Controller has to continually check to see if there is something out there, SBus is not allowing it to initiate transfers from the peripheral. Further things like key presses compete with network packets for attention from the root HUB.
