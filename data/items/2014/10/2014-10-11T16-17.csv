No need to go searching for mysterious ulterior motives when they&#x27;re explained in the post!<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I do remember significant flaws in Access.  For one thing, it was an absolute pain when we wanted to modify the database - we had to get everyone to log off, and then upgrade all of the clients at once.  This is one of those problems that the web solves elegantly.  Also, Access had major issues with concurrent users.  Performance fell off a cliff, and from memory, certain operations were unsafe (I think you could set up a SQLServer which would address the concurrency problems, but we never bothered).<p>But these days we have better options available to us - app stores fix the updating problem, without introducing the css + html + javascript mess.  We have decent, free web servers, and web application frameworks such as Django and Rails that make writing the server side code that drives the RESTful APIs used by the client relatively easy.  But what we don&#x27;t have is:<p>a) an easy way to create a server (this needs to be as easy as sharing an Excel spreadsheet)
b) a coherent development environment from client to server code. Something that allowed you to write apps purely in Javascript (no css or html) with a GUI editor, and which also let you write the server code in node.js would be a close match to what I&#x27;m thinking of.  Bonus points if most of the node.js code is derived from the client-side code, so that the novice programmer doesn&#x27;t need to be aware that a server even exists, it just works.<p>The problem is, that&#x27;s the kind of application that&#x27;s really hard to write.  It&#x27;s big, an IDE in fact, and really Microsoft is the only game in town for making that sort of stuff.  But they won&#x27;t write Android / iOS / Mac clients, so it doesn&#x27;t happen.",1413046798

I know small usability studies are pretty common.  You get someone in a room, ask them to perform some tasks, see what they do.  But if you have an app that people are going to spend their whole day in, e.g. email, office suite, productivity, does anyone really sit down and shadow a user for a day?<p>There might be things you don&#x27;t notice if you only do it for an hour or two, or is it just not the same when the user isn&#x27;t required by an authority to be present?",1413046797

It was mildly enjoyable in the way decent fast food can be enjoyable, but I don&#x27;t understand how people can claim this immature one dimensional story and okay writing constitutes a great book.<p>I enjoyed it because I&#x27;m a nerd who grew up in the 80&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s bubblegum entertainment with the depth of puddle.<p>I love SF, but the lack of distinction (by both fans and critics) between entertaining stories and good literature kinda turns me off and stops me from reading more. I constantly get disappointed when some highly praised SF book turns out to be nothing more than nerd equivalent of chick-lit.<p>Fuck, I even love SyFy channel&#x27;s B-movie crap every once in a while, but at least I don&#x27;t get duped into watching it thinking it is great cinema.<p>I would probably have enjoyed the book more if I had more realistic expectations.",1413046778

But that&#x27;s not really a big deal, at least for now, and I&#x27;m sure you can optimize.<p>Experiments like this show us that graphics and VFX are overrated. It&#x27;s true for games, and it&#x27;s true for movies too. Primer is still one of the best sci-fi flicks I&#x27;ve seen in the last ten years, and they used what looked like surplus air conditioning equipment as props. Sometimes too much FX actually gets in the way of your imagination.

My schedule never involved 6+ hours of sitting without breaks. Even in semesters with a heavy workload, some of the classes were always labs or very interactive, not just lectures. If classes were back-to-back, they were still often in different buildings, so there was a bit of an exercise break between lectures as opposed to walking down the hall in the same HS building. Virtually all professors were open to questions before/after class or had office hours or a TA with office hours -- asking questions was not seen as being a nuisance. Laptops/phones were allowed in nearly all lectures, which breaks up the monotony of sitting passively even <i>during</i> a lecture.",1413046435

Science is sub-optimally close to the &quot;extremistan&quot; end of the &quot;extremistan-mediocristan&quot; spectrum<p>I believe both (why do you think I would &quot;not want to admit&quot; #2?), but the claim I have been making is #1.

No luck involved.<p>Examples?<p>Before you try to p-hack this one, let me specify the null model: scientist as prospector. Like gold in the ground, ideas cluster. Skill and resources determine your rate of sifting through earth, but at the end of the day initial positioning matters a hell of a lot. The founders of a new field are all but guaranteed decades of consistent productivity, but in order to maximize the amount of gold dug out of the ground it still makes sense to devote considerable resources to surveyors who haven&#x27;t yet hit paydirt.<p>What would I see as evidence of the &quot;skill&quot; view? Einstein before 1906. People who are able to consistently make breakthroughs.<p>What do I see as counterevidence? Einstein after 1906. An overabundance of one-hit-wonders. Hundreds of theoretical papers in the arXiv that make the construction of GR look like a rite of passage rather than a singular achievement -- with the exception that Einstein happened to be right where they happened to be wrong or useless (it&#x27;s not like either could tell ahead of time how things would turn out).

It was all nonsense.  The exact opposite happened.

If you have an extended network of friends and relatives in the area, they could assist with food preparation instead of hiring caterers. Some guests and relatives may attend the service with their own family and children, bumping the attendance numbers, but skip the reception or send the kids home. Coming in under $100/head should then be easily doable.<p>Of course this pattern is probably well-correlated with the &quot;goes to church regularly&quot; set and may indicate a level of serious commitment to marriage as &quot;&#x27;til death do us part&quot;, to say nothing of other demographic differentiation.",1413045608

Granted, I only see the weddings where the couple hires live music (not necessarily expensive). But I get to observe some things about the couple, their guests, and how much they spend. All of this is just my biased anecdotal guess:<p>You don&#x27;t have 200 friends, so if you&#x27;ve got 200 guests, probably 180 of them are someone else&#x27;s friends -- distant relatives, business associates of your parents, church members. Perhaps simply being part of a larger network of supportive people helps stabilize your marriage. Especially if you didn&#x27;t invite them to impress them with your lavish expenditure.<p>It&#x27;s just my impression, but it seems like the folks who spent 20k, were the ones who were sold a big package, perhaps because they are young and un-confident about their social stature. They&#x27;re probably spending someone else&#x27;s money. I have rarely if ever seen anybody spend that much if they&#x27;re older than 30 or even 25.<p>So it&#x27;s quite possible that the same marriage will destabilize itself when the partners develop their own independent identities, i.e., &quot;change&quot; to the point where they&#x27;re no longer compatible.

But there is a simple step which can reconcile both approaches.<p>For that, we have to add some functions, so we can write :<p><pre><code>    reduce([0,1,2,3,4]).map(inc).filter(isEven).into(array);
</code></pre>
The names `reduce`, `into` and `array` may surely be improved; but they convey the idea well enough.<p>The `reduce` function takes an iterable object and turns it into a reducible object i.e. an object with an `into` method to which will be provided all the stuff required to reduce the content of the former iterable into a new array, a sum or whatever result which can be obtained adding items one after the other into a seed.<p>Note that the `reduce` function doesn&#x27;t iterate over its argument.
Neither do the `map` and `filter` methods. Along the chain the iterable is simply wrapped with functions and filters to be used latter.
All computations occure when an actual reducer is provided through a call to the `into` method.
Then the mapping and filtering arguments are used to transform the given reducer into a new specific reducer.
(this is why they are called transducers). And then the iterable is reduced using some loop like the one you show.<p>So transducers can be wrapped to be used like regular filters over collections.
The beauty of transducers is that they express efficient transformation chains which do not depend of actual input and output.
By the way, it seems to me that the proposed javascript transducers miss the last point : the proposed `into` function takes an implied reducer which is computed after the input. An array is always reduced to an array ! What about reduction into a string or a sum ?<p>Last remark. Bellow a reducible has to wrap a transducer and the code of `into` has to check if there is actually a transducer (chaining mapping and filtering). 
This is a bit ugly. I think this is due to an over emphasis on transducers. The code would be simpler if we were transforming reducibles either reducers.<p>-------<p><pre><code>    transducers.Reducible = function(coll, reduce, transducer) {

8442509,comment,8442036,8442036,0,0,disallusioned42,,,"This is a fascinating topic to me.  I read it with great interest, and I might even go and do a bunch of my own analysis of the data.  But I can&#x27;t help but think that in a way the whole thing deeply misses the point.  My skepticism started when I got to the third point: &quot;How often you go to church&quot;.  The results seem obvious to me.  In general, churches frown on divorce, so of course church goers are going to have lower divorce rates!  But that&#x27;s irrelevant if the result is that a bunch of people are miserable because they&#x27;re staying in marriages that make them unhappy.  I used to be a regular church goer and I absolutely saw this.  People would stay in miserable marriages because they thought it was the right thing to do.<p>So I hypothesize that what really matters is not divorce rate, but happy marriage rate.  Unfortunately that data is not in this study.  And furthermore, if it was, I would suspect significant bias.  In the church world that I was a part of there was significant pressure to keep up appearances.  So I don&#x27;t think you would be able to trust either the married persons&#x27; self assessment of happiness nor the external assessment of the people who know them.<p>With this new metric in mind, I went back and re-thought the logic in each of the OP&#x27;s significant predictors.  First stop, &quot;How much money you make&quot;.  IMO this one falls flat on its face.  It&#x27;s easy to imagine situations where someone would stay in an unhappy marriage just because their partner has money.  It&#x27;s also easy to imagine situations where someone makes a lot of money, but stays in an unhappy marriage because their partner would get half of it in a divorce.  Another factor that I think is suspect is &quot;How many people attended the wedding&quot;.  When a lot of people saw you get married it seems like there might be more pressure to stay in an unhappy marriage to save face to all the people who attended your wedding.  I&#x27;m a little bit less confident about the reasoning here, but it still seems plausible.<p>The rest of the predictors seem reasonable to me, especially &quot;How long you were dating&quot;.  This one stands up under the happiness test and just seems to make sense, provided that the extended dating years were as similar as possible to the married years, minus the marriage license.",1413044356
