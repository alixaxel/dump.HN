It&#x27;s as if we&#x27;d never seen politics or economics in action and therefore our best guess comes from musings.<p>Democracy does not equal the will or the good of the people in some hermetically perfect way. The reality is that in both economics and democracy entrenched culture, institutions and interest groups gain power. They guard it and enlarge it. They quickly develop the belief that they are entitled to it.<p>The &#x27;good of society&#x27; even if it could be understood objectively is not represented in the volumes of trade policy enacted into legislation after months of committees, &quot;consultations&quot; and such.<p>Political power is the oldest currency.

8415581,comment,8414980,8414980,1,0,knappador,,,"We should stop saying &quot;isomorphic&quot; because the explanation relies on two orthogonal concepts that ensure that &quot;isomorphic&quot; will only ever be applied to Javascript.  That seems possibly self-serving if not only misleading.<p>The diagram after &quot;learn more&quot; is not one but two concepts.  A common backend API for clients and servers is one wholly independent concept.  People can do this with any collection of languages and libraries written for clients on all kinds of platforms.  It has nothing to do with using the same code on the client and server.<p>The other concept in the diagram, using client code both in the web application server and on the client because they both use the same run-time is also not particular to javascript, but is anyone holding their breath for Java applets stuffed into mobile Safari?  We could do it, but it requires standardization that JS even doesn&#x27;t ever seem to achieve in practice (where&#x27;s asm.js on Windows?).<p>Now, we live in a world with LLVM and nearly every language has some Javascript compiler.  Let&#x27;s write the application server code in Haskell beyond a narrow interface that expects to work with JSON and other abstractions that will &quot;just work&quot; with local storage -or- with a file pulled out of /data/data/my.package.org/files/  (Android).  I can&#x27;t call my Haskell-based implementation of these ideas &quot;isomorphic&quot; because the client and server code is not really in the same language as it has been &quot;transpiled&quot; to javascript for web clients.  It&#x27;s heterogeneous in some senses that the &quot;isomorphic&quot; solution is not.<p>However, the difference between these two implementations boils down only to which pieces get stubbed and wrapped up in simpler API&#x27;s.  If you go with Haskell and &quot;transpile&quot; to javascript, then the web client has a Javascript stub while mobile clients will have Java and Objective C stubs to talk to respective platforms through narrow API&#x27;s.  The reverse for Javascript everywhere requires web-views for native mobile clients but &quot;just works&quot; on browsers, like our Haskell &quot;transpiled&quot; solution does.  There&#x27;s probably no difference in amount of work to get hello world working in these solutions on all platforms.  I can screw with Phonegap just as much as I can screw with LLVM for Android.<p>Now, does it make sense to say &quot;isomorphic Haskell?&quot;  Nobody knows what that means.  They will look up &quot;isomorphic&quot; and find it totally outside the lexicon of CS, just like &quot;hyrbid API.&quot;  While it <i>feels</i> cool to say, &quot;Oh, gee it&#x27;s a new concept then,&quot; the concepts aren&#x27;t new.  Java was supposed to be a run-anywhere program.  Separating API servers from application servers and clients has been around likewise for a long time.  Think about the history of any legacy system where many clients start hitting a legacy database.  There&#x27;s your fancy &quot;hybrid&quot; API server, but resulting from accretion of ugly years and not cool enough for hipster coding.<p>In the end, what I&#x27;m trying to say is that none of this stuff is particularly new and we should stop wrapping it up in pretentious sounding labels.   I don&#x27;t like to see &quot;isomorphic&quot; because it sounds like Quorra is going to crash through my computer screen on a light cycle and breath strong AI into my microwave&#x27;s controller board.  People who are looking for the appropriate direction may be roped in and then think they are awesome and that everyone else is jealous.  This has all the makings of an annoying cult in the long run ^__^;<p>Let&#x27;s look in the lexicon of old computer stuff for a COTS label, such as &quot;shared&quot; or &quot;common&quot; to indicate that two non-identical things use the same thing.  There is no need to say &quot;hybrid&quot; API.  It&#x27;s a common API server used by clients and application servers.  If you understand the concept, the words are interchangeable.  Now, for the idea of portable code, well, how about that.  Portable is portable.<p>Our non-pretentious, hypothetical engineer conversation using regular engineering words:<p><i>&quot;Where does the mobile client get it&#x27;s data from?&quot;\n&quot;The same server&quot;\n&quot;The application server?&quot; \n&quot;No, both the application server and clients use one backend server.  It&#x27;s a common backend architecture&quot;\n&quot;So it cuts out a round-trip time for the web client cold loads?&quot;\n&quot;Yeah, and I&#x27;m sure you can see where it saves us time authenticating clients and so on&quot;\n&quot;How do you make sure all the clients treat the data the same?&quot;\n&quot;There&#x27;s some common code in all the clients for unpacking the models from the backend and initializing controllers.  The views of course are really client-specific, but we just run a stub in between each view and the portable sections of the client.&quot;\n&quot;But what about web?&quot;\n&quot;Because the controller and model code are really only dealing with mostly raw data, they&#x27;re very portable and we just transpile them with Haste.&quot;\n&quot;That all sounds a lot like this &#x27;isomorphic&#x27; thing I&#x27;ve been hearing about, but I thought it sounded really pretentious and deliberately esoteric, so I&#x27;ve been avoiding it.&quot;</i>",1412599894

Think of it like a mafia.<p>That said, it has been proved on a TV programme, that a spanish-looking person taking a taxi, the taxi took a short route, and a foreign looking person taking a taxi from the same place to exactly the same destination, the taxi took a much longer and expensive route.<p>That said, it is my opinion that taxi driver and truck driver as a career has its days counted, in the light of innovations such as self driving cars.

Opportunity?<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been obsessing over the FAN stack: Firebase, Angular, and Node.js. And I happened to have a full 3 days available last week, so I hunkered down and cranked this out. And I have every intention of setting it up as a sustainable little passive income project and FAN playground. I can&#x27;t really imagine why OhLife guys felt the need to shut down. I could be way off but back of the napkin calculations for me show this costing less than $100/month to host, even with massive uptake.<p>Now once I went out there and started doing a little promotion, realized that it turns out that there are indeed a couple of other contenders wanting to take OhLife&#x27;s place. One is an open source program that you can run yourself. That&#x27;s only going to appeal to the tech crowd (I think.) And there&#x27;s one called Trailmix written by some guys from Thoughtbot which is charging $3.99/month. (My gut says that won&#x27;t fly.)<p>Cool thing is that the source for Trailmix is open. It&#x27;s a Rails 4 app so I got to see what the same app looks like written in Rails.",1412599558

I have been working on something similar for AngularJS.<p>As far as the benefits or why you would care, there are a few things to keep in mind:<p>1. Some commenters mention why bother since Google now indexes content rendered by client side JavaScript. My answer to this in short is that there is a big difference between a search engine indexing content and a search engine ranking a site highly. For at least the near future we have no idea how much search engines actually are able to capture and it would be difficult for search engines to rank client side web apps and server side websites evenly (i.e. due to the massive history and trust with server side rendered websites). This may change over time, but it does not change overnight.<p>2. SEO is a benefit of Isomorphic JavaScript, but it is not IMHO the primary benefit. The primary benefit comes from being able to create ultra DRY code with one technology, one overarching framework and one way of thinking. There is a lot of power in using the same code in one file at all layers of your stack. To me, Isomorphic JavaScript not only includes the browser client code and the web server code, but also the API, mobile, batch and all other potential containers. There is so much potential power there when you get rid of all the context switching that usually goes on through your stack.<p>I think a valid criticism of Isomorphic JavaScript is that in order to implement it the right way it needs to be customized to your environment (which takes time) and ends up creating certain levels of abstraction that can seem like &quot;magic&quot; to newbies. Most of the frameworks that try to implement Isomorphic JavaScript today either aren&#x27;t complete (i.e. you can&#x27;t use it for every layer of the stack or you can&#x27;t adapt it to your environment) and/or it is too complex and confusing for many devs to grok.",1412598496

A quick googling tells me a giraffe is 5.5m tall whereas an elephant is 4m tall. Since an elephant is also longer than a giraffe the brain to rear hoof distance shouldn&#x27;t really be all that different.
