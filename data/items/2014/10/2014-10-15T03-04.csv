when I am not moving forward on a personal/professional level I can get a bit down. So the cure that works for me 
is to gain a net +ve movement everyday.<p>For work projects that could mean writing  code for a new feature/fixing that inconsistent left margin or devouring my blog posts for any typos. Small victories in professional projects can can give me a boost in my personal life<p>On a more personal level this means reading another chapter of say &quot;Mike&quot; which drives the story forward. For a while I weaned off reading and the books that I was reading on at that time were left unfinished which affected my work as well as it left me dissatisfied with the current state of my affairs. Anyway, what I am trying to say here is that making progress on a personal level is just as important as making progress on a work level. Small victories in one can give you a much needed boost in another.<p>also check out this post : <a href=""http://thefreelancery.com/monday-answers-1-hustling-burnout-firing-bad-clients/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thefreelancery.com/monday-answers-1-hustling-burnout-...</a>",1413345507

Donate to charities that are making a difference.<p>Here are some general thoughts . . .<p>I&#x27;m not an expert on anything healthcare related . . . but I would like to throw some ideas out there of what I think could be done . . . I have been thinking about this lately . . . a lot of this is thinking out loud . . . but maybe this can generate some ideas/brain storming and be passed along to someone who can implement any ideas that would be helpful.<p>My first thought is containment . . . we need to quarantine anyone leaving W. African countries for 21 to 30 days . . . this might sound extreme but we have to contain the spread of the virus (this could apply to US cities as well and should apply to those who have had contact with an infected person anywhere including the US). It would probably be worth setting up quarantine areas near airports that are a comfortable place to stay during the quarantine.  Internet, TV, free food, easily disinfected, etc, etc . . .<p>So now we generally have the virus contained to W. Africa. Now we need to pour aid and doctors in to those countries to prevent further infections and stamp it out.<p>-Tom Frieden (CDC) is saying that a travel ban will make the outbreak worse . . .<p>-Here&#x27;s his quote:<p>&quot;We really need to be clear that we don&#x27;t inadvertently increase the risk to people in this country by making it harder for us to respond to the needs in those countries,&quot; he said, &quot;by making it harder to get assistance in and therefore those outbreaks would become worse, go on longer, and paradoxically, something that we did to try and protect ourselves might actually increase our risk.&quot;<p>Frieden added that a travel ban could make it difficult to get medical supplies and aid workers to the affected regions in West Africa.<p>Ummm, I think controlling people leaving the country can be done while at the same time increasing supplies and medical personnel. Volunteers are risking their life to go help, I don&#x27;t think they would be deterred by a quarantine before they come back.<p>I&#x27;m asking for a simple quarantine for people leaving W. Africa and increasing travel and supplies to W. Africa I don&#x27;t see how a quarantine for those leaving would affect supplies and Aid coming in . . . they could allow pilots and ground crews to leave and fly back as long as they aren&#x27;t interacting with anyone on the ground . . . and medical staff should understand a quarantine period before leaving . . .<p>Treat infected personnel outside the US and other countries . . . setup a state of the art hospital in Africa to treat infected healthcare workers . . . this would further isolate the virus from un-infected countries. If this isn&#x27;t possible I would treat them at a central location in the US initially till they can setup a central location in W. Africa.<p>Ok so we have limited people leaving W. Africa if they are infected and we are pouring in supplies and experts to help.<p>In the US we need to prepare better.<p>Sounds like lots of people were exposed in Dallas before the patient was quarantined.<p>All hospitals and urgent care should have an area, maybe even outside where they evaluate patients with fever and other ebola symptoms where they are isolated from other patients. Basically prevent an emergency room full of people waiting in the same room with an Ebola infected patient.<p>Counties should have special ebola response units. Basically an ambulance that is only used for transporting suspected ebola cases. Even some that might only be pick up only where they go by and the patient comes out and rides alone in the back . . . setup the ambulance where it can be disinfected easily . . . and then other ambulance crews where they have an EMT suited up in full bio gear to interact with the patient if needed.<p>Family members should immediately be moved to a new location for their quarantine, not confined to the location where the patient was . . . this location should monitor their temperature, provide TV, Internet, coordinate remote work if possible with their employer, food provided, etc.<p>Waste disposal, setup a clean team in each county with training and a plan for cleaning houses/apartments and where to dispose of the waste.<p>Healthcare workers . . . how can someone get infected treating a patient in the US, I know accidents could happen but I expect everyone would be following protocol to the letter on the first one.<p>Lets expand the protection level/suit types for healthcare workers . . . better filtration masks, etc . . . the buddy system is a good idea . . .  build ebola areas in the hospital so healthcare workers can be sprayed down with a solution to kill the virus on their equipment before removing their suits/masks after interacting with the patient . . . also setup a waste disposal plan at every hospital.<p>Contacting your rep. and senator is always a good idea so they know you&#x27;re concerned and donations are always a positive way to make a difference.",1413342832

I&#x27;m just trying to communicate the tendencies of groups.<p>Men want to be able to contact the women who interest them (read: are attractive). Men desperately want to not be filtered out, and will stoop to basically any amount of lying to get around filters.<p>Women only want to be exposed to the men who interest them.

But that&#x27;s not all. It gets worse.<p>Women don&#x27;t want to do any of the work or take any of the risk. Women expect men to approach them, and then they will sift through the suitors for the promising ones. And at the same time, men will lie, cheat, and otherwise bullshit to avoid being filtered out so they can spam dick-pics at every woman in range. Think of your typical hormone-driven bar scene.<p>You&#x27;d think you could change these patterns, by putting women in control on a site and inverting the central power dynamic.

If you were in a car and it lost the ability to sense speed via the speedometer, how would it pull over and stop?  How would it know how quickly to steer towards the shoulder?  How would it know when it had stopped?<p>When airline autopilots were developed you didn&#x27;t have a dozen ways to sense speed.  With a car you have the speedometer, GPS, probably some kind of estimates from LIDAR and vision, and the ability to integrate output from the accelerometers and feed all those into a kalman filter to make a really good model for the car&#x27;s speed even if the more accurate methods fail.  Certainly there are good odds it could perform well enough to move the car to the shoulder.<p>I guess I am less worried about those kinds of more minor failures and more worried about the kinds where humans are suddenly thrust back into the loop.  On airplanes the pilots nearly always have a way to control the plane and plenty of time to react since they&#x27;ve got 5-30 minutes worth of glide.<p>In a car when something goes wrong you might well have vehicles on either side, in front and behind if it&#x27;s heavy traffic.  And in that case if the car finds itself asking for a human driver very suddenly who has to start making very good decisions faster than a human is capable of.<p>In my mind the &quot;you can always pull over and stop&quot; only works if you&#x27;re assuming that the car is driving on an immaculately paved stretch of nearly or completely empty road.",1413342339
