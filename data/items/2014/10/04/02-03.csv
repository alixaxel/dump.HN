Bugs happen, hardware fails, attackers try to cover their tracks. The bug I (and the original reporter in this bug report) are referring to is journald&#x27;s behavior when corruption happens: shove the log aside and start from scratch. Even worse, the attitude that ignoring corruption is &quot;not a bug&quot; is insane.<p>Yes, fixing a corrupt binary database (even a simple one) is going to be <i>very</i> hard. What they fail to mention is that the reason they are face with this difficult problem was their decision to use that kind of format in the first place. When faced with the realities of their bad design choices, pretending there isn&#x27;t a problem is not the correct answer. The correct way to handle that bug report should have been either fixing the bug (make journalctl able to handle corrupt logs), changing previous bad designs (drop the format that makes this a problem), or at a bare minimum recognize that this is a serious problem for some people and leaving the report open if it cannot be fixed right now.<p>Given that this kind of external corruption has a very good chance of being the <i>very reason</i> you have to search the logs, how a logger acts in that kind of situation is of key importance.",1412390383

8408604,comment,8408121,8408121,2,0,Alex3917,,,"I think the author is overestimating how prepared the US healthcare system is to handle a real threat if one arises:<p>- The U.S. has been advertising that we&#x27;re the ones with the cure for ebola, so where is anyone with money going to go as soon as they get exposed? And while most of the victims are among the urban poor, there will be more wealthy people who become infected as the epidemic increases in scale.<p>- Even if we have better technology, the cost of treating each victim here is exponentially higher. The cost for each patient could easily be close to a million dollars if you count 2+ weeks in the ER, licensed biohazard disposal and decontamination, network tracing, quarantining exposed contacts, etc.<p>- Nearly 50M Americans don&#x27;t have health insurance. If going into the ER risked you getting kept there while waiting for test results, possibly losing your job, and getting getting stuck with a bill for tens of thousands of dollars even if you don&#x27;t have ebola, it&#x27;s hard to imagine that many of those people aren&#x27;t going to just wait a few extra days.<p>- In the US healthcare workers are generally paid well enough that they can just leave their jobs, maybe not comfortably, but with enough money to at least feed themselves and get by. It&#x27;s hard to imagine that we won&#x27;t have large numbers of healthcare workers just taking off if this ever gets serious. Especially since US healthcare workers aren&#x27;t trained to deal with ebola, and largely aren&#x27;t interested -- notice how most of the people going to west Africa to volunteer in this crisis are missionaries, not doctors.<p>- We have all sorts of religious fundamentalists in the US who think it&#x27;s god&#x27;s will that the US be destroyed for condoning homosexuality or whatever who would be more than happy to help the process along, and more than enough people abroad who would gladly sacrifice their own lives to disrupt our foreign/domestic policy.",1412390319

Does it work with entity framework?  OWIN?  What&#x27;s the story with the F# to javascript compilation; did they invent that or is it another project?  Who are these people?<p>I think it&#x27;s a shame that the C#/.NET ecosystem can&#x27;t seem to have FOSS nice things because it really hampers stuff gaining traction.  However I find the open source license for this is very clear and generous; I still can&#x27;t seem to figure out if ServiceStack is safe to use :|  This should allow for learning the framework and providing nice things to the community, and then the licensing seems reasonable compared to the value proposition for working on commercial software.",1412388453
8408562,comment,8405769,8405769,3,0,tathougies,,,"This is for legacy reasons dating back to the time of the 8086 processor. Basically, the 8086 could only access 1MB of memory. In this one megabyte, the BIOS would store a lot of data structures (necessary for accessing disks and setting the video mode). When the first 32-bit processors came out, the original 32-bit operating systems still needed to make use of the BIOS in order to do things like change screen resolutions and enable graphics. To do this, they needed to leave the lowest 1MB of space intact and memory mapped to the corresponding physical addresses. Executables had to be based above this 1 megabyte in order to not overwrite the BIOS. 0x400000 is hexadecimal for 1 megabyte and so executables are often times loaded here.",1412388383

Which might be problematic.  Compressed air might also work at that sort of level of material as well.  At least for initial launch stages until you need to switch over to another type of propellant (or a more controllable engine).",1412388366

Obviously that&#x27;s not the courier and printer guy, so maybe I&#x27;m missing your point, but a lot of the difficulty of matching employers to employees is the high (sometimes ridiculous) demands on the applicants because the employers believe they have the upper hand in the market.
