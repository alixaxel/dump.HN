8409755,comment,8406358,8409054,0,0,fivedogit,,,"You don&#x27;t have to buy each point in the video (I agree about the computer music) to agree with the larger trend: human brain labor is being phased out. Some already has (aspects of car manufacturing), other large swaths are coming soon (car driving), and the laws of economics will ensure that nothing will stop it. A job is something wealthy people begrudgingly pay you to do until they can figure out how to replace you with a machine.<p>When I watched &quot;Humans need not apply&quot; the first time, it was a near-religious experience for me. It framed some of the observations and frustrations I see and feel every day and helped clarify the core trend: capitalism has worked really, really well during the labor-based phase of human civilization. Will it work well when human labor is no longer required? What happens then?<p>The obvious extension of &#x27;Humans need not apply&#x27; is that the financial rewards of the march of technology have been concentrated in the hands of the few. The 100+ workers it used to take to work a farm aren&#x27;t now chilling on a beach somewhere. The founders and stockholders of John Deere are (or their grandkids are). The workers are struggling to find work driving cabs or what-have-you, only to be crossed-out by Google in a few years. There&#x27;s nowhere to hide. I applaud the entrepreneurs at John Deere and Google and they deserve every penny they made, but the concentration of liquid wealth (excluding homes and cars) into the hands of just a few is fostering profound <i>opportunity</i> inequality. While some folks are becoming wealthy on a scale that&#x27;s hard to even wrap your brain around, what chance does an Appalachian or inner-city kid have to make it in today&#x27;s world? Almost none, especially when computers can do things like drive cars.<p>As the video states, the trend is <i>everywhere</i>. Take Canva, for instance. For some portion of small companies and startups, guess what? They don&#x27;t need a full time graphic designer anymore. Web frameworks and cloud services have lead to the rise of the &quot;full stack&quot; engineer when there used to be a dedicated database person, app tier person, frontend person, etc. <i>Everywhere</i><p>A major, major inflection point of human history is coming in the next couple of decades, and there is no clear solution yet. European-style socialism doesn&#x27;t work very well and obviously Russian-style oligarchy sucks. So what will we do?",1412438341

I like my workstation and still use it, but the macbook was an experience in which almost everything made sense e.g. no suprises with standby and wifi oddities which plagued me on ubuntu. In those 2 years I went from wowed to disappointed and the thought of &quot;this works pretty well on linux by now&quot;. E.g. I was plagued by a wifi error (no auto reconnect) since mavericks when bluetooth was on, which tens of people could reproduce -  it took Apple 9!! months to fix this.\nMultiple non-deterministic freezes when clamshell/external monitors was enabled or disabled, again since mavericks, which seems to have stopped in the latest update 10.9.x though I cannot correlate this to any changelog.\nAnd then the whole shitty experience with the forced transition from gcc to Clang as a developer.\nErgo, I can concur with the author",1412438203

8409750,comment,8408452,8408816,2,0,skybrian,,,"The way I think of it is that an IO value is a program where all the Haskell code runs in callbacks. This is a bit like a JavaScript program where everything runs in a callback. The major difference is that callbacks written in Haskell are constrained to be pure functions.<p>The IO type is rather rigid in that there is always a next callback, which implicitly contains the entire program state as part of the function closure. In a reactive programming language like Elm you can have many functions that may be the next callback depending on what the next event is, along with all the callbacks that run as part of the signal graph. Purity is about how constrained the callbacks are, not about the overall structure of the program.",1412438112

Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;ve given you a promised-pure function which emits commands (re: the &quot;Command pattern&quot; if that&#x27;s the way you want to see it) and you operate them using side effects. This is a massive inversion of control issue of course, but you can see how it might work.<p>Further, you might understand that your job is easier due to the purity of the command-emitting function. You explicitly give it all of the inputs you desire and operate it as needed. For instance, you can perhaps run it forwards and backwards as desired. Or weave it in with another &quot;thread&quot; I parallel knowing that only you must handle races and shared memory—the threads are pure.<p>Finally, you might understand that the risk of bad programming is borne on your shoulders primarily—side effects are complex and you&#x27;re the only one handling them.<p>In Haskell, &quot;you&quot; are the RTS and the pure threads are Haskell programs. The IO monad is nothing more than what it feels like to be &quot;inside&quot; a useful kind of command pattern. Finally, we compartmentalize all side-effects into the RTS so that we only have to get them right once.",1412437543

8409723,comment,8408452,8409183,7,0,dllthomas,,,"I think a part of it is a slight weirdness of Haskell typeclasses.  In math, the noun &quot;monad&quot; refers to is a triple containing a functor and two natural transformations.  The equivalent noun in Haskell would be the typeclass <i>instance</i> for a particular type.  However, because Haskell (basically) only allows one instance per type, you select different instances by choosing a different (possibly equivalent, as with newtype) type, and so there is some natural conflation that arises in the language people use to talk about these things.<p>The dynamic may be slightly clearer for semigroups.  In mathematics, a semigroup is a pair containing a set and an (associative) operation on that set.  In Haskell we say things like &quot;ByteString is a semigroup&quot; but that&#x27;s short for &quot;there is a semigroup where the set is all possible ByteStrings&quot; and you assume the people you&#x27;re talking to understand what the operation is because there is only one instance of Semigroup commonly defined for ByteString.",1412437350

8409687,comment,8408452,8409501,1,0,bunderbunder,,,"So, speaking as someone who loves functional programming but finds a lot of the flap surrounding the recent popularity of Haskell to be tiresome (just the flap, the language is great), I see it this way:<p>Purity makes it easier to reason about the semantics of your code. This isn&#x27;t about parallelism, it&#x27;s about concurrency, including single-threaded concurrency.  Case in point, I recently spent quite a while scratching my head over a bug that happened because someone else had written some code to mutate a piece of shared state when I wasn&#x27;t expecting it.<p>But the pure functional programming model is a very high level of abstraction (deep down, every interesting thing in computing is a state machine), and it has a tendency to leak like mad.  One such case where it does so is I/O.  In fact, you can&#x27;t even do I/O in a 100% pure language - and that&#x27;s what the I/O monad is really about; it&#x27;s punching a hole in the language in order to let the big bad ephemeral outside world in.  But in a controlled manner, so that the language&#x27;s fundamental ethos of purity can be maintained, which in turn makes its laziness manageable.  In short, the deeper downer reason why Haskell loves its I/O monad so much is because without it the language would be fairly useless.  Anyone who tells you the I/O monad&#x27;s really about making I/O concurrency headaches less of a hassle has been doing more blog-reading than programming.<p>So why preserve the illusion?  Well, ghettoizing all things stateful lets you take advantage of pure semantics everywhere else in your code, which theoretically makes it easier to reason about and maintain.<p>As for monads themselves, IMHO they&#x27;re kind of overblown.  It&#x27;s just another design pattern, akin to Visitor or Strategy or Decorator, only functional instead of object-oriented.  Super-useful, applicable in all sorts of circumstances, and easily worth knowing.  And, just like object-oriented design patterns, easy to make sound way more complicated than it is if you try to explain the idea to someone else without having fully digested it yourself first.",1412436401

8409683,comment,8409020,8409020,0,0,hippich,,,"Simple approach which while took some time, did work great for me in long term:<p>- register on odesk.com and elance.com (same owner, but slightly different projects there)<p>- start from very low hourly rate to build history and feedbacks. Make sure that every client is super happy and leave only 5 stars. Try to focus on small projects in the beginning (you don&#x27;t want to get stuck on large project with low hourly rate, and bumping hourly rate in the middle project both unfair and hard to do)<p>- As you get projects closed (also reason to start with small project - to close these quickly) follow with client to make sure he leave nice review. In the very beginning you don&#x27;t want really to focus on relationship, since these clients unlikely be able to pay higher rate in future, but you have to get to get project to complete client satisfaction.<p>- Bump hourly rate few dollars every week/months/x projects/x dollars billed. You need to find perfect formula here for yourself. Good signal to bump rate - when you get offers to work on project and you don&#x27;t feel like you will be able to do it &#x27;cos of a time constraints.<p>- If project does not satisfy your curiosity or feels like a BS project (this all will be based on what you personally like and do not like to do) - never decline projects, but instead make a &quot;fuck you bid&quot;, where you multiply your &quot;normal&quot; bid by x2 / x5 / x10 (again, you will need to find perfect formula here). Idea is that you never say &quot;no&quot;, but instead make client say &quot;no&quot; or get paid a lot for doing something you do not want. This also makes you look more expensive and your work more precious.<p>- Don&#x27;t be afraid to bump rate. It is a bit contradictory, but in my practice very often well paid work came with very reasonable clients, and work where project was on very tight budget came with manager-jerk. Somehow when you charge a lot, clients respect you more.<p>- Do all of this until you reach point where total revenue will start dropping off or you find yourself without necessary projects. It is very important to keep in mind that 100% &quot;employment&quot; should not be main driver behind hourly rate pricing. You need to find optimal balance of number of hours you need to spent on projects vs. your hobby project or self-education. It is MUCH better spend 20 hours a week at $50/hr vs. 40 hours a week at $25/hr.<p>Hope this helps :)",1412436247

We can now bid on jobs that would have overwhelmed our capacity before.<p>So who won?

The founder has a bunch of programs which analyze the code. In the case of mainframe assembly there are many weird tricks. Self modifying code or jumping into the middle of an instruction are common. There is even one program where the code jumps into a constant to cause an abend.\nThe translation process works like a charm. \nMy job is to get the translated output working in java and compare it to the original to make sure the translation works. A few things need to be tweaked by hand, but every once in a while we&#x27;ll get a series of programs where the original coder uses the same tricks over and over again and a new rule has to be added to the translation tools.\nSome programmers used all kinds of odd tricks. I can tell when a program was written by the same person, just by the style of coding.\nIt&#x27;s a fun job.",1412434833
