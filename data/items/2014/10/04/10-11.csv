This is a radical viewpoint I&#x27;ll warn; many of my (otherwise seemingly reasonable) friends fear that &quot;the music will stop&quot; unexpectedly and that today will be one of &quot;the good old days.&quot;<p>I had an insight the other day (while watching one of Hans Roslings videos): it is mathematically impossible to distinquish an S-curve from exponential growth until/unless that growth flatterns, just from the shape of the growth alone.<p>The good news in case this is an S-curve and not exponential growth: we just stop widely growing, we don&#x27;t peak and crash.",1412420296

Lafferty (<a href=""http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/R._A._Lafferty"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/R._A._Lafferty</a>), was an engineer and Catholic who took up scifi/fantasy writing in the 1960s at the age 45.  He could read all languages of the Latin, German, and Slavic families, plus Gaelic and Greek.  His personal library was about 8000 books, he wrote 29 novels and 225 short stories.  His writing is a bit of an acquired taste, but often encapsulates multiple time periods of history.  Don Webb, writing about Lafferty, <a href=""http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=1110"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=1110</a><p>---<p><i>&quot;Lafferty makes use of dead language words to play\nupon our collective unconscious ... Lafferty&#x27;s use of Greek, Latin, Irish, and Hebrew tags is not merely demonstration of his\nvast erudition. It is a technique used by magicians for\ncenturies to give their spells potency. Whereas he directs\nmost of his narrative at our conscious—using simple\ndaytime language—he also directs the same tale at our\nunconscious achieving a form of meta-communication.<p>... Lafferty plays upon our subconscious in another\nway—the use of rhythm. Yevgeny Zamyatin developed\nthe concept of a &quot;prose foot&quot; as a way of internal\npacing of fiction. He saw it as a kind of rhythmic device\nthat by causing the reader to remember an earlier part\nof the narrative became a force for a choral (as in\npertaining to choruses) cohesion that bound the story\ntogether in a different way than plot mechanics.&quot;</i><p>---<p>Because he could read so many languages, Lafferty was able to integrate primary source material, works which didn&#x27;t migrate forward, today unavailable to readers who can&#x27;t read Latin, Greek, etc.  A recent article on Lafferty, <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/13/ra-lafferty-secret-sci-fi-genius-poised-for-comeback"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/13/ra-la...</a><p>Old books about science, religion & magic need to be evaluated in the context of historical timelines, e.g. it would be interesting to see a histomap for schools of thought, <a href=""http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/08/12/the_1931_histomap_the_entire_history_of_the_world_distilled_into_a_single.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/08/12/the_1931_his...</a> .

(One way my main client works around this is to have a senior dev always quote the tech side. Even if a junior dev does the work, they only get paid the quote, so they effectively self-adjust their hourly rate according to their skill level.)<p>- I would charge (and have charged) reading the docs, figuring out how to compile, and integrating a third-party payment lib I&#x27;d never seen before. So, specific tools/libs outside of the norm, I consider chargeable.<p>- Research for what I do is usually a write-off, but I can sometimes work a couple hours into the quote for a prototype if there are big unknowns. Or, before quoting, I say &quot;give me a couple of hours to prototype, with the understanding that if we go ahead it&#x27;s a component of the quote, if we don&#x27;t go ahead you&#x27;ll pay me anyway.&quot; Sometimes I don&#x27;t charge the prototype, but it&#x27;s instrumental in convincing the client to go ahead at all, so it&#x27;s still a win.<p>- Tangent of a tangent, but kinda related to your &#x27;research&#x27; point – quoting is really hard, mainly because quoting <i>thoroughly</i> approaches the complexity of doing the work for real. So a lot of my quotes are &quot;if things go how I hope they will this will take 1 hour. If things go badly I&#x27;ll come back and talk to you because we could be looking at days.&quot; Unknowns are really hard to quote without just doing the work.",1412417389

There&#x27;s barely any decent clients there who are willing to pay us $30/hr. However, you have the experience, and I&#x27;m very well aware that RoR developers here can easily command a salary of PHP150k-200k every month... perhaps even more. All you have to do is find the right company, and ask.<p>If you check out Jobstreet and JobsDB and set the salary filter to a minimum of 100k, you&#x27;ll still find plenty of openings for Ruby devs.",1412416843
