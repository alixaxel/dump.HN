That looks unlikely to change in the next decade, so keep your Intel stock.<p>That said, for a lot of interesting use cases, like that king-hell postgres database sitting in the middle of the swarm, or video processing, or streams processing, or indeed any situation in which thousands-to-millions of simultaneous actors need to work on the same shared state, this sort of system starts looking real interesting.<p>As a thought experiment, think of this system like a GPU, except every single processor is a fully capable 2 GHz i5 running Unix, and instead of having to deal with the CUDA or OpenCL API, you can just write erlang (or haskell; .. or whatever) code and it will run.  And instead of having 2-8G of RAM, you have 48G.  And instead of having arcane debug tools, you have recon and gdb and ddd.<p>I don&#x27;t think there is a pendulum, I think there&#x27;s a spectrum and has always been one; pragmatism should always rule, and your use case is not my use case.

8495435,comment,8494840,8495384,0,0,eqdw,,,"> The city doesn&#x27;t know how to police this. How would you build a law or tax around regulating this behavior? New York may attempt a pied-a-terre tax, but no one really knows how to deal with this issue of vacant housing units held as investments. Technologically, it&#x27;s easy to track who is doing what where at all times. But legally, there are a lot of issues around privacy with policing this if foreign buyers are taking up 1/3 of the new housing stock as investments.<p>As someone who seems to know way more about this than I do: what about a land value tax? I&#x27;ve heard a few urbanists talk about a land value tax as an incentive not to withhold properties from the market. The reasoning is that with a property tax, if you leave property undeveloped, it will have a low property value and your tax rates will be low. But with a land value tax, the value (and consequently the tax rate) is a function of the value of that location, which in turn is a function of density, nearby amenities, demand, transit connectivity, etc. With a land value tax, someone keeping a property off the market in SF would be paying increasingly large amounts of tax on it, as the value of the land goes up along with the development nearby.<p>Do you have thoughts on this?",1414014958

You can&#x27;t even afford that on your average tech salary; the only reason the people living there can afford it is because they moved in before the prices rose so much.<p>The second, something I only learned recently, as of Sept 30th of this year, companies in the Bay Area with over 50 employees are legally required to either subsidize public transit for their employees, or provide their own (source: <a href=""https://commuterbenefits.511.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://commuterbenefits.511.org/</a>).

8495384,comment,8494840,8494840,0,0,ktothemc,,,"I was the person who wrote that super-long take on the San Francisco housing crisis in spring on TechCrunch. <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/sf-housing/</a><p>I&#x27;ll just say this. It&#x27;s four issues compounded.<p>1) Growth controls enacted in the 1960s and 1970s: Beginning in the late 1960s, the California Supreme Court started making a series of anti-development rulings: for example, one decision ruled that cities didn&#x27;t have to compensate property owners for down-zoning their property, which reduces its value. This, of course, reduced financial risks for city governments that wanted to downzone massive tracts of land in their territory.<p>At the same time, cities across the Bay began enacting growth controls. Petaluma was the first in 1972, with an ordinance that restricted the number of houses that could be built per year to 500. (Economic studies comparing Petaluma with adjacent cities showed that its property prices rose at a faster pace than cities w/out growth control.)<p>Anti-growth measures began being widely adopted across the entire region. The behavior of California home prices started deviating from nationwide norms around 1975 or so. The problem became especially acute by the late 1970s, and so homeowners and tenants gave themselves a very sweet deal by effectively freezing their property taxes and rents via Prop. 13 and rent control. This insulated a majority of voters in cities like San Francisco from having to make tough decisions about in-fill development to match population growth. At this point, the mismatch is so out of whack and land is so valuable in San Francisco, that building a lot more housing probably wouldn&#x27;t make it affordable to, say, a teacher salary level. Construction costs are $500,000 per unit, so your base price has to be at least that.<p>2) A byproduct of tech-dependent economic development strategy happens to be a lot of income inequality. I haven&#x27;t seen a good solution to this. After manufacturing jobs dissipated from the U.S., a handful of cities like New York, Boston and San Francisco were successful at reviving themselves through a route of attracting highly-skilled, high-income workers. A consequence of this is a barbell-like jobs market where you have highly compensated workers in finance and tech on one side, and a whole cohort of service workers on the other. I&#x27;ve seen this wherever I travel. I went to Tel Aviv, which is arguably more dependent on tech than San Francisco with 10-11 percent of the workforce in the industry versus 6.7 percent here. Same issues with income inequality, inclusiveness and diversity.<p>3) Globalization of capital flows. Real estate used to be more of a local business, but now a lot of local firms have been swallowed up by REITS, which don&#x27;t have any connection to the local community. At the same time, the Chinese property market is collapsing, sending flows of homebuyers and their cash over here. These are people who may not intend to actually live in the Bay Area, yet they buy up homes without even seeing them. The city doesn&#x27;t know how to police this. How would you build a law or tax around regulating this behavior? New York may attempt a pied-a-terre tax, but no one really knows how to deal with this issue of vacant housing units held as investments. Technologically, it&#x27;s easy to track who is doing what where at all times. But legally, there are a lot of issues around privacy with policing this if foreign buyers are taking up 1/3 of the new housing stock as investments.<p>Similarly in the venture world, while overall VC funds being raised is lower than what it was during the first dot-com bubble, according to the NVCA, there&#x27;s a lot of PE and foreign investment that I don&#x27;t think is calculated into the overall numbers.<p>4) Last is the lack of regional coordination. New York is 8.4 million people under one government. London is also 8.4 million people under one government. The Bay Area is 7 million people under 101 city governments and 10 bus and rail systems. There have been numerous attempts to consolidate power over the last century, but all have failed. The California state Constitution also deeply empowers its city governments compared to other states. So what happens is the rich cities don&#x27;t build any housing, because they like their property values and don&#x27;t like traffic congestion, or to crowd their schools. This drives prices up in the suburbs to a point where, on balance, urban environments look more attractive -- not just because of changing tastes, but also because they&#x27;re not <i>that</i> much more expensive than the South Bay. So young people end up crowding into these poorer disinvested neighborhoods like the Mission or Oakland, which then displaces minorities and the elderly far out into the exurbs or even Central California.",1414014391

Keying a car and driving it away might have different names but are on the same scale.<p>- There ain&#x27;t no self help. If you think someone else&#x27;s stuff should actually be your stuff, your path is through a court.<p>- We don&#x27;t fix things with injunctive relief that can be fixed with money.

Because we are not idiots.<p>- The &quot;someone&quot; who cuts the check is Samsung or Apple, not their customers. As far as I know no one&#x27;s managed to go after end users, even in extreme cases like a $10 designer handbag where the buyer obviously knows it&#x27;s not real. (And it&#x27;s at best unclear whether going after the buyers would make any sense, even in those extreme cases -- if someone pays knockoff prices for a knockoff product, it&#x27;s the seller and not the buyer who has ill-gotten gains.

I say that slightly tongue-in-cheek, but there&#x27;s a legitimate social problem here.  Rents in SF could not grow so out of control without the income disparities also growing.  Of course a city is not a closed population, so a good portion of the problem comes from rich people disproportionately moving to San Francisco, but even with that it&#x27;s clear that on a national level income inequality is increasing in a very de-stabilizing way and SF is a microcosm of those dynamics.<p>Unlike previous economic booms of the 19th and 20th centuries, there is no mediating factors such as a massive need for human labor or a common cultural belief among the mega-wealthy in a moral duty towards philanthropy, or even just simple taxation.  Automation is getting so sophisticated that these days a lot of productivity gains come from deploying capital to automate things (software being a part of this), and not only do all the gains accrue to the capital holders, but the gains are taxed much less than regular income.<p>So the deck is stacked heavily in favor of people coming in and flipping SF property for massive profits simply by virtue of holding the capital to be able to do so.  The fact that they get one unannounced tax curveball thrown their way is not someone that remotely compares to someone choosing a profession and working their whole life only to find that rents quadrupled in a 5-year period.  The answer is not &quot;sorry buddy, you should have been a banker or a computer programmer, but I hear Modesto is still pretty reasonable&quot;; there aren&#x27;t enough such jobs to maintain a middle class that way.",1414014188

Not to mention that if those people can&#x27;t live in the city and close down or move their businesses your life there won&#x27;t be as good.

Say your chips are being used on MRI machines, cars, planes, glucose meters, ATM machines and a whole host of other mission critical systems.  And you know clones are dangerous because they are unreliable, failure prone and nondeterministic in some way.  What do you do?  What should you do?  Bricking these devices without warning would be a bit extreme, agreed.  What if you figure out a way to ensure that legitimate chips work and others fail in whatever way based on the nature of the cloning design.  Is that OK.  What if people could die?  Not trying to be dramatic at all.  Just saying that sometimes you need to be in someone else&#x27;s shoes in order to understand their ecosystem and have context from which to understand their decisions.<p>I&#x27;ve been using FTDI chips since they came out.

Being a user, he&#x27;s of course in the best place to debug and add the features he uses and wants.  But from the corporation and marketting point of view, it&#x27;s not always the best: the product owner may want to prioritize the work done on the software on other criteria than a user/programmer might have.  In those situation it may be better if the programmer is less of a user of the software and just implements the requirements, from a technical point of view.<p>The software development requires knowledge and skills that may be quite different from the knowledge and skills required of the user of a program, and when the application domain is quite exotic (from the point of view of the programmer), it may be understood that while the programmer can write the code implementing the specifications, he may not have the ability to run (effectively) the program.  Again, it may be unrealistic to require extensive domain knowledge from everybody from the team. This is something that the product owner and functional analyst provide.  The programmers will provide the computer science and engineering knowledge.<p>As a program developer, I don&#x27;t know anything about farming, but the most general notion.

I tend to have a preference for textual CLI, emacs-like user interfaces and programmable systems).<p>You definitely want a real user, a domain expert, to use your software, rather than programmers.<p>Of course, unless the software is a developer tool (but even then, some prefer IDE, some prefer unix environments, some prefer emacs).",1414013469

Redfin uses the website to automate as much of the agent&#x27;s work as possible, freeing up the agents for the necessarily high-touch work.

The optical flow won&#x27;t change since it is determined by the source video.  Then you layer in your ad projection, render with final result with the ad and the source video together and finally concatenate the rest of the video that didn&#x27;t require projection.<p>Being that the screen time for these ads is quite short in comparison to the entire video, and the start and end times of visibility would be known for each ad placement you can just splice together the actual targeted video and not worry about the other parts of the video that don&#x27;t have placements.  Of course Mirriad may not be so heavily optimized yet in the workflow, but hey, they&#x27;ll get there and it is only a few perl scripts with calls to ffmpeg anyways.<p>As for the servers needing to store different versions of the video a few points:<p>1. Storage is cheap, bandwidth or CPU is expensive.  And we&#x27;re billing the advertiser.  Re-rendering videos for adaptive streaming is a cheap cost and there isn&#x27;t generally a real time requirement.
2. If you don&#x27;t want to store multiple versions and are using HLS for streaming delivery, you can just splice together the playlist of multiple optical flow rendered segments with EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY.<p>The problem is delivery via Youtube and being able to do fine grained consumer targeting.  It would be better to be self hosted so you can use the various consumer targeting services like BlueKai and not have to build an entire segmentation platform.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow</a>",1414012633

Tenants have no problem pushing this bill stating that buying a building does not entitle you to a lifelong contract and that &#x27;things can change&#x27; which will negatively effect you. So even though you bought a building a year ago with no hint it could be taxed at 25%, you are now expected to pay that tax if you sell.<p>Now, on the other hand we have tenants who are upset that they have to leave their homes they (wrongly) assumed they could rent in forever. Either this is from ellis, OMI or other eviction. I feel for these people to a extent- But I am not a believer in the whole &quot;right to stay in your birth city forever&quot; movement. I do not believe anyone has any more of a right to live in San Francisco than they do Malibu or Aspen. It is one of the most expensive metros in the US.<p>If you are a 90 year old grandmother who was counting on your landlord not evicting the whole building, you should have known that was a risky bet to begin with. If you want to stay in a place forever you should buy the home. Otherwise, you need to be prepared to move should situations change. You need to prepare for all &#x27;disasters&#x27; - That could be eviction, fire, death, floods, etc.. If you dont prepare, I will be sorry for you- But I dont think that entitles legal protection either. If you lose your house from a fire with no insurance, you are going to bare that burden alone.",1414011782

For drivers this comes in the form of massively increased fuel costs. For transit users this comes in the form of increased fares, since BART practices distance-based pricing.<p>Commuting daily from Fremont to SF costs $12, that&#x27;s over 1h of minimum wage. Imagine if you had to pay 10-15% of your total income (pre-tax!) just to get to work. More if you&#x27;re unable to get a full 8h of work a day.<p>Moving further also means a large reduction in disposal free time. Free time is a bit of a misnomer when it comes to the poor though - since the time isn&#x27;t actually free. The article touches on this at a few points - the working poor require a lot of government subsidies and aid organizations for survival, all of which takes time, and most of which are located in SF.<p>One of the key inhibitors in helping people out of homelessness is, to be simplistic, lining up for things. The basic services they need to survive have huge lines to access them, making a large proportion of their lives idling in a waiting room, waiting for one necessary thing after another. Imagine the DMV, but every day, and multiple times a day.<p>All of this exacerbated by living far away. Not only are you waiting around forever for basic things, you&#x27;re now spending more time to get there in the first place.<p>Even to a rational, completely-informed actor (an unsafe assumption, to say the least), the economics of living further away may not actually work.",1414011703
