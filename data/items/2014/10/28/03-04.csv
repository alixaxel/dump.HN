8519468,comment,8516414,8518912,0,0,fredophile,,,"> Getting more people into the bucket of &quot;people who installed a custom theme&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually help your bottom-line conversion rate until you can establish unequivocally that the people you&#x27;ve added to the bucket convert at the same rate as the bucket did before they were added to it.<p>This is incorrect. Let&#x27;s say we have two buckets, A and B, where bucket A is people who haven&#x27;t used a feature and bucket B is people who have. If some testing shows that people in bucket B convert far better than people in bucket A you make a change to get more people into bucket B. The change is successful if more people end up in bucket B and bucket B still outperforms bucket A and the total contribution coming from bucket B is higher. Bucket B doesn&#x27;t need to perform equally well before and after the test.<p>Using the numbers from the link bucket B was performing at 10x the conversion of bucket A. Out of 10,000 users bucket B contributed 70 subscribers. After the changes bucket B received almost five times the users as previously and converted at four times the rate of bucket A. Out of 10,000 users bucket B contributed 884 subscribers. If the change had no impact we&#x27;d expect more users in bucket B but not more subscribers. These numbers aren&#x27;t really accurate since I took them from the diagrams in the article and they change what they&#x27;re looking at between the two. To be correct you need to compare the same thing before and after changing a feature.",1414468481

Though the company is small it is somewhat high profile in our city and our founder is well connected with devs, managers, and founders at many of the companies with open positions that I would consider applying for.<p>Some context: Our founder on two occasions has told me that he heard from people at other startups that an employee of his (a coworker of mine) had applied for a job there. In both cases the people making the call are well respected people in our community. Perhaps I was/am naive to think that that was inappropriate. Neither person got an offer from those companies and it made things very weird at work.<p>Why I&#x27;m thinking of leaving: I like my job a lot but frankly I&#x27;m pretty sure I can get a better offer somewhere else and I&#x27;d like to see if that&#x27;s true.

8519463,comment,8519054,8519135,0,0,robomartin,,,"Facebook has problems. They are forcing page and group owners to advertise in order to reach their fans by manipulating organic reach and preventing direct communications with page fans. For the most part you can only expect single digit percent reach of page posts to page fans.  Boosting posts --paying-- is the only way to reach them all.  Page owners don&#x27;t like this.  Many page owners are slowly devising strategies to take their fan base outside of FB.  This is particularly problematic when you spend money inside or outside FB to build an audience that, ultimately, FB does not allow you to own.  And, again, they make you pay again and again to reach them.<p>Then there&#x27;s the issue of fake likes or paid likes that fall outside your campaign specifications.  You pay for likes from the US and get a barrage of likes from Bangladesh.<p>The next issue is engagement.  People like pages because they like the pictures or something else in the ads.  After that they have zero engagement with the page.<p>This, coupled with limited reach of posts on your page, means that your posts might reach a bunch of people who are utterly irrelevant to your mission (Bangladesh) or absolutely disengaged (love the pictures).  We advertised for a page, reached hundreds of thousand of people and received a real education as to the minefield that FB can be.  I am absolutely convinced that the same amount of cash would have produced vastly better results had we spent it on Google ads.  We would end-up with a list we could communicate with, groom and grow rather than a page with people who&#x27;s relevance, targeting and engagement are in question.  And, to add insult to injury, we have to pay dearly to reach with each and every message.<p>Yes, to answer the question, we are transitioning our list away from FB as quickly as possible and will not advertise at all after that.  Live and learn.<p>We&#x27;ve heard that Twitter can be far better than FB in many regards in terms of reaching and connecting with your audience.  I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll learn all about that in the next few months.",1414468322

8519458,comment,8516481,8518642,0,0,Dove,,,"&quot;There&#x27;s no internet&quot; is a rather damning accusation that can be made of practically every sci fi story written up until there was actually internet!  And even then, they generally didn&#x27;t anticipate just how <i>much</i> it would change our lives.  Stories set hundreds of years in the future contain computer usage patterns that look primitive within five years of when they&#x27;re written.  Amazing!<p>I think that in itself is a commentary on just how big a deal the internet is, historically speaking.<p>I think the classic tropes of science fiction are a product of the era in which they are written:<p>Starships must have seemed inevitable in a culture that witnessed the aerospace industry progress from its first powered flight to landing on the <i>moon</i> in a few decades.<p>Androids as stock material and fodder for stories about race issues must surely have come from a culture that didn&#x27;t see their programming as the hard or interesting part of the question.  Now that we know how hard it is, stories set decades in the future are a lot more conservative about how relatable the AIs end up being, what they can do, how human they really are.<p>The cyberpunk tropes of lone hackers and underground teams outmaneuvering corporations and governments seem to me like a big reflection of the hobbyist PC revolution of the 80s and 90s.  They seem quaint now, though.<p>I found Brin&#x27;s <i>Existence</i> really refreshing on this front -- the predictions and tropes seem based on looking at technology of today and extrapolating from that.

A single virus particle can be lethal, or patients only become highly infectious at the end-stage? Unfortunately it&#x27;s really complex, and some of these aren&#x27;t even contradictions.<p>I think the only way to really analyze it is through the macro-level &quot;R0&quot; (basic reproduction rate) which seems quite low, but that also depends on accurate reporting. If the reporting is accurate within an order of magnitude then it truly is hard to catch / easy to avoid, and hopefully we see the numbers start to turn in the next few weeks.<p>My guess is that because there&#x27;s a very limited amount of time a person can be both symptomatic and ambulatory, given a remotely functional health care system and a culture which minimizes contact with the deceased, the virus would be self-defeating.",1414468119

There have been a lot of interesting comments on the three threads on here. People pointed out some bugs and overall issues which I will be fixing (also, the site should not crash half as much now). This is just a fun side project I have been messing around with so I can get better at using data science in various applications. If you would like to help build it out for fun further let me know! Also, feel free to submit a bug or suggestion for an improvement if you really want to.(<a href=""https://github.com/kevinmcalear/hater_news/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/kevinmcalear/hater_news/issues</a>)<p>3. I wanted to build the &quot;hater score&quot; for two reasons. First, to see how accurately I could build a model to measure insulting comments in the wild and second (if it&#x27;s accurate), to see how people would react to seeing how positive or negative they usually are on Hacker news (or other social networks).<p>4. I wanted to make sure everyone knows that just because something is your &quot;Worst Comment&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean it is negative. Most people have very low scores and most of your comments are  not identified as insulting. (It would be over 50% if it is actually an insulting comment.) So most people on HN are not actually haters. I just had a more &quot;hater&quot; focused design just for fun. There are in fact actual haters though, if you look hard enough.<p>5. Something I found interesting is clicking the &quot;Back In The Day&quot; checkbox. It takes your 50 oldest comments and analyses them, instead of your 50 most recent.<p>6. Finally, if you&#x27;re not sure why some comments are getting ranked higher than others, feel free to look at the training data I used (it&#x27;s from a kaggle competition from a while back.) and read my blog post. If you don&#x27;t want to here are additional features I used on top of standard bag-of-words (CountVectorizer):<p>* badwords_count – A count of bad words used in each comment.<p>* n_words – A count of words used in each comment.<p>* allcaps – A count of capital letters in each comment.<p>* allcaps_ratio – A count of capital letters in each comment / the total words used in each comment.<p>* bad_ratio – A count of bad words used in each comment / the total words used in each comment.<p>* exclamation – A count of &quot;!&quot; used in each comment.<p>* addressing – A count of &quot;@&quot; symbols used in each comment.<p>* spaces – A count of spaces used in each comment.<p>If you have suggestions on other features I could collect let me know! I&#x27;ll also be building a way to get actual training data from HN itself and letting HN users determine if a comment is actually insulting or not so that the predictions constantly improve.",1414466588
