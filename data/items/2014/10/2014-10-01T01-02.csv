Here are a few things I&#x27;ve noticed so far:<p>1. Writing Rust code definitely takes more time than Python or Ruby, but it&#x27;s not bad in practice. I can&#x27;t measure the productivity difference yet, partly because I&#x27;m still learning Rust. I do spend more time thinking about how to write zero-allocation and zero-copy algorithms, and trying to get my code to compile (but see 3, below).<p>2. It&#x27;s possible to write very fast code without compromising memory safety. It&#x27;s great to see key parsing operations happening in ~100 nanoseconds, with no allocations.<p>3. Rust is one of those languages where I need to work to make the compiler happy, but once I manage that, the code generally works on the first try.<p>4. The tooling is very good: library management, unit testing, benchmarking, documentation, error messages etc., all work very nicely.<p>Overall, it lacks the instant gratification of a really good scripting language. But I keep finding myself back in Emacs, writing more Rust code for the fun of it. And I really enjoy the combination of low-level code, memory safety, and a useful selection of functional programming features. I&#x27;m glad to see a new language in this niche.",1412127534

I&#x27;m 17 years old from Rimersburg, PA i&#x27;m a young developer who has worked with one fairly large company on an iPad game and a few small projects of my own. My life has been complicated since that job... My parents recently got divorced and there is little to no money around my house anymore i live in such a small area that jobs are rare but my skills are above a regular job... What are my options as to making some extra money with my skills online? Freelance is sorta hard to compete with a school schedule i&#x27;m a senior at a high-school in my area as right now i want togo to college for Neuropsychology but that all depends if i can get financial aid because legally my parents aren&#x27;t divorced yet as the court is still processing it. My job with the recent company a couple months ago (5) had togo because i was suffering to much from low-grade depression and severe depression because of the divorce. I know i could leave the sob story out but thats the sole truth. I&#x27;ve got some skills in server management Windows & Unix/Linux. I&#x27;ve got developmental skills in PHP, CSS/HTML/CSS, NodeJs and worked with some frameworks here and there... I was just wondering if anyone out there needed a young guy to help manage a project for a very small price as i don&#x27;t live on my own yet i just want to make some money to be able to leave the area for college. Willing to really do whatever and learning a new language is no problem at all. I&#x27;m available from 3 pm to 3 am on the weekdays the weekends are whatever; i&#x27;ve got a nice development setup that i paid for all on my own.

Exactly.<p>Honest to God. <i>A statement of probability is not a fact, it is an estimate</i>. You aren&#x27;t even familiar with the terminology.<p>> Claims about probability still require factual support ...<p>False -- they require <i>evidentiary</i> support. A probability estimate requires a basis for making the estimate, which I provided. If you had any understanding of either science or statistics, you would be familiar with what I&#x27;m talking about.<p>Here&#x27;s the evidence:<p>1. There are no species that were present on Earth a billion years ago that are still present in the same form, i.e. able to interbreed with their forebears.<p>2. There are few species that meet the above requirements from 100 million years ago.<p>3. There are a handful of species that meet the above requirements from 10 million years ago.<p>4. Modern humans have existed only for 200,000 years.<p>5. Using the simplest statistical methods, accessible to an average college student, we can write a distribution that takes into account the fact that modern humans didn&#x27;t exist 200,000 years ago and extrapolate into the future, showing that our likelihood for existing as the same species we are now, 200,000 years in the future, is very small. This is a statement about probability and likelihood, areas with which you are clearly unfamiliar.<p>6. On the above basis, the probability that modern humans will exist as the same species a billion years from now is zero.<p>7. On that basis, the probability that modern humans will witness the sun enveloping the earth five billion years from now is also zero.<p>If you can&#x27;t understand the above argument, by all means keep your ignorance to yourself.<p>> There may be a reasonable basis for that conclusion, but if there is, you haven&#x27;t presented it, so it would be inaccurate to claim that you have successfully made that point, even if it is a point that could have been succesfully made.<p>Look -- go back to the philosophy department, where contentless arguments like yours, arguments indistinguishable from two children negating each other, are welcome.<p>In your fantasy, modern humans, which didn&#x27;t exist 200,000 years ago, have some chance to be present to worry about the sun absorbing the earth five billion years from now. And you think my probabilistic estimates are doubtful.
