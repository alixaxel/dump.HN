The tokamak uses a magnetic field to hold the plasma in the shape of a torus, or ring, and maintains the reaction by inducing a current inside the plasma itself with a second set of electromagnets. The challenge with this approach is that the resulting energy generated is almost the same as the amount required to maintain the self-sustaining fusion reaction.&quot;",1413385111

For example, you never need to write a test to check for null-pointer-exceptions if you code in Haskell.<p>Static types also help in situations other than testing. For example, you can use &quot;guardrail programming&quot; to be much more liberal when refactoring things: want to change a function signature? Just change it and the compiler will point out what other parts of the code need to be updated. This is even if you haven&#x27;t written a test suite yet or are doing big changes that invalidate the old test suite.<p>That said, I think the perfect world would be one that lets you mix dynamic and static typing in a single program (some things are hard to verify statically, but would be nice if we could at least express them as types) but I think we are still a way off that being a practical alternative.",1413384998

Expanding who you know, how much they like/admire you, and how much they want to work with you is <i>part of meritocracy</i>.  Imagine it as a multiplier to product merit and,as a founder, you NEED to imagine it as part of your job.  In a failure scenario, it absolutely helps turn a zero into a one.

Lawyers salaries get a reputation of being high because most people don&#x27;t realise that:<p>1) most lawyers do not work in front-facing roles in law firms. They are in house counsel, or consultants, or work in finance or employment or for charities or many other fields where salaries are low.<p>2) the hourly rates they see are 2-3 times higher than the lawyers salary <i>on the low end</i>. In big law firms the multiple is <i>much</i> higher, because there&#x27;s a massive amount of support staff (e.g. my ex practised at a law firm big enough to have a 24/7 team to print documents, 24/7 IT support helpdesk for staff etc.), and because that&#x27;s how the partners make their profit.<p>3) there&#x27;s a small core of really, really expensive lawfirms that gets all the headlines. E.g. in the UK we have the &quot;Magic Circle&quot; lawfirms (the five largest UK firms - of which 4 are in the top 10 largest lawfirms worldwide - the rest of the top ten are US firms), then the &quot;Silver Circle&quot;, and then the rest. The Magic Circle lawfirms have training contracts that pay in the GBP 40k+ range, and 1 year post-qualification lawyers can earn 60k-100k (GBP). Salaries then tend to go up by <i>huge</i> steps every 6-12 months, so up to several hundred k GBP for senior associates, and a couple of million for partners in some of these firms. Far more for equity partners in some niche firms. Now consider the mean salary again, and consider how much these firms pull it up...<p>4) many of the &quot;best&quot; paying firms works people to the bone, and so absolute salaries are high, but hourly rates are not. My ex. qualified at one of the Magic Circle firms, and though she made more than twice the UK average salary, two years out of university, she worked so many hours that her hourly rate was less than what her secretary was paid (she&#x27;s since shifted to a non-practising role in the same firm for exactly this reason; coming home at 3am was not enough to make the money worth it). She was billed out at 200 GBP per hour, but her salary was fixed, so of course it was in the firms interest to work people as hard as possible. And everyone in these firms are asked if they will &quot;voluntarily&quot; sign away the EU Working Time Directive restrictions (UK has an exception from the Working Time Directive that allows UK employers to do this; in theory it is illegal to punish staff for not signing a waiver; then there&#x27;s practice).

Use case: Moloch, with it&#x27;s focus on PCAP, is a cool network forensics tool, to be sure.  Our focus is not only on security, but also on performance and troubleshooting.  We use the traffic data as a foundation for integration with IDS alerts and latency (and jitter) data.  The ability to pivot between views and visually correlate this data is incredibly (and surprisingly) useful for IT Staff who want to know at a glance if things are correlating or not.  So I would suggest that Moloch is a little more limited in it&#x27;s scope, at least in it&#x27;s default configuration.<p>2. Usability: This ties in with the point below too.  Our focus is making network analysis approachable for the average IT guy.  Keeping things light, visual, and easy to use is super, super important to us.  It&#x27;s really the top item on our list under, you know, having correct data.<p>3. Maintainability (or SLAs, or whatever you want to call it). When I look at Moloch, I&#x27;m reminded of Zimbra, the free email server.  Last time I installed Zimbra, it involved installing a lot of different stuff, configuring it all, and groking a LOT of documentation for different components before it was working to satisfaction.  This is perfect for a certain market segment, the IT guy who has the time and energy to - not really roll his own - but to be really involved in everything that&#x27;s going on.<p>the Sentry is not for that IT guy. We market to IT staff who don&#x27;t have the time to install and maintain a bunch of components for a single tool. They have a security / network vision need (sorry about the buzzword) that needs to be filled, and they don&#x27;t have a month to stumble through a complex linux  install.

This has been covered under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, but I am not familiar with any recent adjustments they have made to that law.<p>Downloading a copy of a movie under a torrent is illegal not because of the download, but the uploads of you seeding the file. I believe this has been established in the courts.<p>With all your examples, regardless of the material involved, can be perceived as theft under copyright protections if the copyright holder wishes to pursue it as such.

It could also be argued you have also gained the dollar that you were supposed to give to me in the transaction. That is the simple matter of why I consider it theft.<p>If the copyright holder was giving out the material without financial gain but with specific restrictions and one violated the restrictions, then I would say that is copyright violation that is not theft. But if the copyright holder expects monetary compensation as part of the agreement to let you consume the material and does not get it? That is theft.",1413383151

The overhead cost of advertising is huge and we pay for that too.<p>3. We pay the opportunity cost of a product that cannot put users first because you live or die by giving advertisers what they want (and what we want indirectly and secondarily). This includes both the cost of lost privacy as well as business, editorial and design decisions that optimize for advertising revenue. As has been said, you are using us as products more than treating us as your paying customers. Let me restate to be extra clear: WE are the paying customer, but we don&#x27;t look like that to your finance department.<p>4. We pay for all the collateral damage of advertising, such as the tremendous amount of link-bait and other garbage that advertising perversely incentivizes.<p>5. We pay the social costs. Democracy and the free market assume people make voting and purchasing decisions based on facts and reason. Advertising undermines democracy[1] and the free market[2]. Advertising is predominantly about manipulation and deceit. I believe this is the most expensive cost of content that relies on advertising revenue.<p>Added together, we end users are paying a lot more for &quot;free&quot; product than if we could just straight up pay you.

8458460,comment,8457013,8457190,0,0,opendais,,,"> I think Google is at a big disadvantage when it comes to shopping. Amazon already has a powerful ecosystem. You can become an Amazon seller. Amazon sells it&#x27;s own brand of many items, which are all high-quality, low-price. Amazon has a well-understood review system, with comments. Amazon has fairly strict quality controls, and if something goes wrong, Amazon will bend-over-backwards to make sure it comes out in your favor. I have never been burned in nearly a decade of Amazon usage. I don&#x27;t know anyone who has.<p>Well, I know quite a few people who have. I am one of them. I&#x27;ve had to issue chargebacks in my dealings with Amazon for stuff I bought via them that they failed to deliver on.<p>Amazon&#x27;s &quot;strict quality controls&quot; aren&#x27;t really existent either. They have no quality controls in place beyond the customer feedback/complaint mechanism and some crude delivery/shipment tracking mechanics.<p>Amazon doesn&#x27;t have the ability to inspect the merchandise it ships a significant percentage of the time so claiming they have &quot;strict quality controls&quot; is ignorant at a minimum.",1413382139
