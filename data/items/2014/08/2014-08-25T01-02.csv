8220210,comment,8219506,8220158,19,0,eric_bullington,,,">If you feel like the type system fights against you, chances are that you are doing something wrong.<p>Like most things, I think this depends on context.  Doing exploratory data analysis in a static, strongly-typed language, for example, is extremely painful.  And writing quick, one-time scripts in such languages is usually more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  For this reason, Python is a wonderful language for doing data analysis and writing quick one-time data munging scripts (and yes, I realize that Python can be considered strongly-typed).<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;ve now been exposed to languages like OCaml and Rust, and have had time to think about Java, and I now have a different attitude when I&#x27;m building a large application that will have to be maintained.  I&#x27;m beginning to feel <i>extremely</i> vulnerable when I use a language like Python or (worse yet) Javascript to build such applications.<p>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m not a Javascript hater.  I <i>like</i> Javascript in general -- it has a kind of functional feel to it, it&#x27;s easy to prototype quickly, you can use it client and server, nice ecosystem, and unlike so many I actually <i>enjoy</i> async programming.  And I&#x27;ve long enjoyed Python for similar reasons.<p>But for building a robust application that will have to be maintained a long-time, you have to religiously write tests in these languages or you&#x27;ll be buried in bugs.  And even then, you <i>still</i> may be buried in bugs that a static, strongly-typed language would have detected.  For this reason, I&#x27;m looking hard for an static, strongly-typed alternative to Javascript for the browser (i.e., a language compiling to JS) for building large applications.  And Ocaml&#x27;s js_of_ocaml is definitely on my list of things to evaluate.<p>So the programming language philosophy that I adhere to now is encapsulated in the hackneyed old saying &quot;use the right tool for the job&quot;.",1408930298

Let&#x27;s consider the advantages of centralization:<p>(1) A single agency can have within its mandate, expertise, and budget the security apparatus, which requires full-stack authority: airport design and administration, customs officials, airlines, planes, luggage, etc.  The airlines can focus on the task they actually want to perform and are qualified to perform, whereas the one agency responsible for security can be audited and held accountable for that task as a unit.<p>(2) Customers cannot purchase less security.  This is an advantage.  It is nonsense for a customer to walk openly onto an aircraft carrying a rifle.<p>I think &quot;airport security&quot; has much less to do with passenger security than the risks inherent with allowing planes to fly through our skies.  9/11 is a clear example that many more people than the <i>passengers</i> of the flight can be affected via air-terrorism.  This is why planes are controlled.<p>I&#x27;m not opposed to that control; I just marvel at how awful a job the U.S. government does at determing the cost/convenience/effectiveness tradeoffs.  In my experience in the United States, this seems to be a systemic problem with governmentally-administered services that does not seem to exist so much in other governments.<p>There aren&#x27;t many airlines, and I expect the overwhelming majority of consumers would consistently purchase the cheapest option.  If airlines are the agency entrusted with safe flight, this makes <i>everyone</i> less safe.  Rather, airport and flight security seems better serviced as an airport-surcharge or tax.  What&#x27;s missing is effective, accountable security provided by experts that we trust.  I don&#x27;t know why that isn&#x27;t something we can solve.",1408930239

This construct clearly states the implementer (e.g. Oracle) is there simply to provide an expert service and no deliverable&#x27;s are being defined and no responsibility is on the implementer to &quot;complete&quot; any work. You&#x27;re essentially just paying an hourly rate for an consultant and that consultant is under your direction (as such, 0 liability in on the implementer).<p>(2) Fixed Fee Deployments. This construct clearly articulates deliverable&#x27;s and earn-out. Once the implementer successful completes a predefined milestone, the implementer will earn-out a predefined amount. In this construct, the only liability the implementer burdens is the labor to achieve the milestone and typically they can disengage at anytime.<p>In both contract types, it clearly states the implementer is not responsible for damages, missed deadlines, etc.<p>So again, I&#x27;m curious to know how Oregon is going to win this case.<p>Disclaimer: IANAL",1408928651
