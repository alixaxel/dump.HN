But Oracle agreed to build a Website, then did a terrible job of it. Meanwhile, the state of Oregon believed they were about to go online, so they spent a lot of money on advertising to alert and prepare the public. Then people tried to use the site and couldn&#x27;t. Taking the money and running would have been less trouble for everyone involved.<p>There are any number of similar horror stories on the Web, many of them involving governmental agencies with which we must interact. The US post office Web site is perfectly terrible, and there&#x27;s no one home. One example -- they have an autopay scheme, one of those features where you give your credit card number and your periodic bills are automatically paid. But someone forgot to include a location for the CVV code in the credit card form, the credit card issuers won&#x27;t process transactions without the code, as a result of which the autopay scheme doesn&#x27;t work. Each post office customer has to find this out for himself. And reporting the bug is pointless -- I reported it five years ago and not one character in the Web page has changed.<p>Some companies are so incompetent at Web site building that they&#x27;ve simply given up and require you to call them on the telephone to transact business or pay a bill. I must periodically update my credit card information, so I have a hot list of companies that I have an autopay arrangement with. First I log on to their Web sites -- about 2/3 of the companies accept an online update, the remaining 1/3 either have a nonfunctional Website that they think is working (like the USPS), or they just don&#x27;t have a way to update payment information online, so they list a phone number to call.<p>When you see a terribly designed Website, you naturally enough wonder how secure the overall operation is, given the incompetence reflected in the front end -- which is by far the easiest part.",1408834072

It is, at its heart, a file management and viewing application. What advantage does it get by spurning the notion of File and View menus? How is it made better by having a toolbar full of non-standard icons that literally duplicate the menu bar? Is it merely UX idealism that would lead one to argue that menus that have items <i>twenty words long</i> is needlessly suboptimal?<p>There are GUI conventions which at this point have been with us for three decades, and no matter what operating system you&#x27;re using the vast majority of programs you use follow them. I would never argue that it&#x27;s impossible for a program to be improved by deliberately flouting those conventions -- but I&#x27;d argue that you need a defensible rationale for doing so. A sound system for a large space has different tradeoffs and design considerations than a home theatre system does, but it&#x27;s actually following a different set of well-considered conventions, right? I don&#x27;t think calibre&#x27;s UX design is well-considered at all; I think it was put together by someone who doesn&#x27;t know much about UX design, isn&#x27;t willing to learn, and whose reaction to even gentle criticism is to dig in his heels.",1408833731

If not, does it bother you as much as not having total control over the Chromecast? How are they different (or not) from a Chromecast? A phone? A computer?",1408831565

That&#x27;s US$0.05 so for a million dollars you could add 20 gigabytes to the blockchain.<p>Of course, in the default client will also only generate 750,000 bytes per block, and the block rate is about 6 per hour, so the blockchain shouldn&#x27;t grow by more than 0.1 gigabytes a day. And if it takes 200 days to execute a denial of service attack, people might notice the attack and adjust fees or limits to make the attack more expensive.<p>With that said, presumably if bitcoin becomes widely used (and appreciates in value) there will be many more transactions (requiring larger block sizes) and the transactions will be much smaller (requiring smaller transaction fees). So if you think you might want to perform a denial of service attack in the future, invest now!<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_fees</a>",1408831522

The timer options (where you set 25 minutes, etc) was active and I was already typing.
