But yes, the GHC RTS is basically a VM.<p>>libraries built for concurrency and fault tolerance<p>Yes, Haskell has those. Specifically, libraries work no matter how they&#x27;re being executed (concurrently or otherwise), and they&#x27;re fault tolerant in the sense that error conditions are encapsulated in the type system and the libraries do not generally crash.<p>>It is a fork-join or just a plain thread+queue.<p>Well, not necessarily. I can express an actor however I want. Haskell forks aren&#x27;t like regular C forks; they&#x27;re much more flexible. It&#x27;s basically the same thing as Actors in Erlang. The thread only gets picked up when something happens to a resource it&#x27;s waiting on (like actors in Erlang).<p>>The winner in concurrency is system that has most fault tolerance tooling built in.<p>Well, Haskell has excellent fault tolerance support, but the recommended programming style is just to never crash, which is an entirely reasonable request when you&#x27;re writing in Haskell.<p>>&quot;Millions of concurrent&quot; threads are useless if the crash of one brings down the rest.<p>There&#x27;s no particular reason it would. See the `catch`, `handle`, etc. combinators for how to deal with errors in Haskell (although again, it&#x27;s recommended just to write programs that don&#x27;t crash).",1407293976

8140653,comment,8140298,8140298,18,0,JasonCEC,,,"I debated this ~4 years ago on the Penn State University Parliamentary Debate team. During the practice session I tried to use this as an argument against the claimed moral high ground of the prohibitionists.<p>It failed; our coach and the rest of the team we&#x27;re able to prove to me, with a more careful reading of the article (and checks from other primary source material) that there was never a &quot;Federal Poisoning Program&quot; and that most of the deaths resulted from a lack of communication with those looking to drink while alcohol was illegal.<p>On both of those points:<p>- 1) Only industrial alcohol was legal to produce during prohibition. Industrial alcohol contains methanol, a compound that can cause blindness and death. It takes a good amount of skill and refinement to remove all traces of methanol from alcohol to make it ready for human consumption - a step that the legal distillers had no reason at the time to take (and would have in fact had them closed down for bootlegging)<p>- 2) The Federal Government never added poison (methanol) to alcohol made by bootleggers - had they found the bootleggers, they would have destroyed their stills and jailed them, not poisoned their stock, brought it to market, and sold it. I believe[citation needed] only about 10% of the alcohol produced by the bootleggers was contaminated in any way, and even less caused &#x27;permanent damage&#x27; beyond what you would expect from people drinking alcohol.<p>- 3) The order to add methanol to industrial alcohol is historically dubious...  All of the citations I can find for it in the searchable web (read: Google) links back to the original Slate article. Supposedly, the article is based on this Article in Nature[1]. From the abstract, it is more likely that the mass of laws and policies that followed the ratification of the 18 amendment included an understanding that industrial alcohol should be exempt but rendered <i>purposely</i> undrinkable - which it already was.<p>I am personally against prohibition, and against the government attempting to mandate morality;\nbut I fear that this article is popular because of its anti-government attitudes -  but you could only come to the conclusion that there was ever a &quot;Federal Poisoning Program&quot; if you give perfect foresight agency to every policy the government passes....<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7279/full/463299a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7279/full/463299a...</a>",1407291223

Although I have my doubts as to his legitimacy as a whistleblower (wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if he was an NSA shill, just like it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if Snowden was too), he gave an incredible talk, and accused the NSA of some pretty egregious civil rights violations.<p>I can&#x27;t find his talk online, so I&#x27;ll just attempt to summarize one of his points. Basically, he said that in 2000-2001, he had developed SIGINT algorithms for <i>selectively</i> monitoring communications of the &quot;bad guys&quot;, within some low <i>n</i>-degrees of separation. He also put in protections to make sure that the identities of all targets were encrypted, until proper legal process allowed the NSA to decrypt them (I was unclear who held the keys). He said that his superiors happily implemented his solution, but stripped it of all selective monitoring logic and identity encryption. That was the event that caused him to decide to become a whistleblower.<p>(He also ridiculed the NSA&#x27;s defense that it&#x27;s too hard to separate domestic communications from foreign ones, since, after all, the IP addresses and phone numbers can be disambiguated by simply looking at the first couple digits.)<p>So, in short, according to William Binney, the NSA is absolutely engaging in non-targeted, bulk data collection.",1407291075
