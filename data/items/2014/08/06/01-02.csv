8140584,comment,8140225,8140540,6,0,mikeash,,,"This got me thinking: why are short-term rental services so expensive? Surely the driver makes up a large chunk of the cost of a service like Uber, so renting the car alone should be much cheaper.<p>My guess is that rental services need a considerable oversupply of vehicles to make up for the uneven nature of demand. If I&#x27;m going to use such a service, I need to be reasonably certain that I can get a car within walking distance, and that means they need enough cars within a fairly small area to handle the 95th percentile of demand (or whatever percentile is appropriate).<p>With something like Uber, the supply is effectively shared within the metro area, so sudden demand in one small area doesn&#x27;t hurt. If the nearest Uber car is a five-minute drive away, that&#x27;s fine. If the nearest ZipCar vehicle is a five-minute drive away, you are probably not using ZipCar today.<p>I think this brings us back to the continuing discussion of self-driving cars....",1407290298

For example, the model doesn&#x27;t have to care about precise pitches and timing, because those are not relevant for recommendation (and latent factor prediction) anyway. That means no model capacity is wasted on these things. With a fairly complex task such as this one, I think that probably makes a big difference.",1407290116

8140564,comment,8138211,8139504,1,0,eridius,,,"Well, you do the latter anyway. In order to spend USD issued by the issuer Foo, you actually don&#x27;t really have to trust Foo at all yourself (though obviously you have to trust them enough to hold their credit), instead either the other party in the transaction has to trust Foo, or there has to be a third party that trusts Foo and is willing to exchange Foo!USD for some other currency that the other party accepts. You only really have to trust Foo to be good for the credit yourself if you want to cash out. And even then, if someone else trusts Foo and is willing to exchange Foo!USD for some other currency that you trust better, you can do that too.<p>It&#x27;s a lot easier if you really do trust the issuer, because then you don&#x27;t have to worry about finding someone else who does who will exchange Foo!USD for another currency.<p>Also, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that even with Bitcoin you end up having to trust specific entities to be good actors. Notably, any time you use an exchange you have to actually trust the exchange to give you the value you paid for. For example, if I use Coinbase to exchange BTC and USD, Coinbase ends up holding a balance on my behalf. I have to trust that if I request to withdraw my balance from Coinbase, that they&#x27;ll actually deposit the USD in my bank account, and will actually send the BTC to another wallet of my choosing.<p>In fact, the whole MtGox debacle is a great example of how this completely and utterly failed. Didn&#x27;t a lot of people lose a lot of money, in the balances that MtGox held for them? People trusted MtGox and their trust was violated.<p>---<p>Basically, the need to trust individual entities is not new with Stellar. Bitcoin has the exact same issue. Stellar has the benefit of being more likely to be adopted by existing centralized financial institutions, which are far less likely to abscond with your money, than the various gateways/exchanges that deal in Bitcoin.",1407290025

In extreme cases some feel that they&#x27;re not worthy of that anymore or that they&#x27;ve become a burden to society, so they take their lives.

This, and not the fact that web browsers use it, is why people implement their service APIs in HTTP.<p>When you give a developer a websocket/WebRTC data channel/etc. and tell them to do RPC over it as a &quot;lower-overhead alternative to HTTP&quot;, you inevitably get badly-greenspun (and almost never actually-lower-overhead) HTTP. Making HTTP itself lower-overhead is the best decision in the medium-term.<p>(In the long term, an HTTP-compatible RPC protocol that runs directly over SCTP+DTLS would be pretty cool, though.)",1407287470
