It seems unlikely that a new terminal-esque tool would succeed without some kind of legacy support.  The best concept I&#x27;ve come up so far with is to build in affordances which handle legacy vs. new-world user interaction and app I/O models.<p>Related, I continue to hold out (vain) hope that elastic tabstops[2] will someday gain traction.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nickgravgaard.com/elastictabstops/</a>",1408074863

8180947,comment,8180201,8180583,3,0,keerthiko,,,"Besides the reasons mentioned, another point I&#x27;ve heard from talented artist friends is that specific art assets have a tiny market -- Most games require the art to be customized a non-trivial amount to suit their game&#x27;s atmosphere, theme, color schemes, etc -- Even generic things like zombies, fighter jets, rocket launchers, medkits, etc. So stock art assets tend to only be used in prototyping phases, and after that an artist is contracted to finalize the asset.<p>Since this is the usage of their products (early prototypes), artists can&#x27;t charge the premium they deserve for the quality of the product.<p>The only way they can is they create super-specific but very cliche/popular artwork, like planet earth, Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty, iPhone, Desert Eagle, etc, which can actually be sold for a premium because they can be used as-is in polished final games. And then, only the best one or two of each item rise to the top of the marketplace and obviously noone needs the rest.<p>The Unity Asset store is a good place to look to get an idea for the economics of free/for-sale art assets. There are very few models/art assets that can be used in production, and the most usable/popular items are either tools, customizable assets like shaders, particle effects and materials, prototyping asset packs, or the specific items like I mentioned. And none of them can sell for very much.<p>From Unity devs I&#x27;ve heard the tools category makes the most money.",1408074058
8180945,comment,8180493,8180916,4,0,godarderik,,,"According to a study published several years ago, mainstream languages seem to operate on an information density/speed tradeoff [1].The authors found that languages that are spoken faster seem to encode less information per syllable than those uttered at a slower pace.<p>This does seem to suggest that biology may be the limiting role in controlling the rate at which humans convey information. Indeed, the language mentioned in the article seems almost laughably cryptic and dense. However, I feel that the limitation of the mentioned study results from the fact that it treats information on a relatively limiting per syllable basis. Quijada seems to suggest that an artificially constructed language has the ability to incorporate all the implicit meanings of a phrase that are left unsaid in normal conversation.<p>Ultimately, while Quijada&#x27;s project seems quite unlikely to catch on among those who are not fringe pseudoscientists, it poses interesting philosophical questions about the nature of speech and communication and perhaps earns its title as a &quot;conceptual-art project.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://rosettaproject.org/blog/02012/mar/1/language-speed-vs-density/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rosettaproject.org/blog/02012/mar/1/language-speed-vs...</a>",1408074006

It really comes down to developing and maintaining some best practices:<p>- Always use prefabs wherever possible. But avoid nesting prefabs<p>- Always save your prefabs, then save the scene before pushing. Thus the .prefab files are also updated through git: these are more robust and have higher priority than the scene.<p>- Make sure source control uses meta files (unless you&#x27;re using Unity&#x27;s Asset Server) so that scene references are stored again in separate files updated through git.<p>- Make sure individual developers have a lock on individual prefabs. Unlike scripts, Unity will bomb changes from one side of the merge on binary files, but this is expected when using git on binary files. Of course you can treat the scripts as any other code project, and they merge fine.<p>It&#x27;s still not ideal, and we occasionally wind up with merge issues or a day of having to carefully iron out scene conflicts when doing larger branch merges, but they haven&#x27;t been so dreadful as to make us decide never to use it again because of the collaboration issues.",1408073204

8180915,comment,8180690,8180690,47,0,JustinCEO,,,"Law school grad here (top 10 school). Anyone asks my opinion (which seems to happen an awful lot -- I guess lots of people consider law school at some point or another), I tell them I think it&#x27;s a pretty bad idea.<p>1) The cost (direct and opportunity) is ENORMOUS. And even with special federal govt repayment plans, if you don&#x27;t get that big firm job, the debt will potentially weigh you down well into middle age (with the possibility of a nasty tax bite at the end if you have any assets and the law isn&#x27;t changed).<p>2) The likelihood of getting a high paying job is slim. It&#x27;s even pretty risky from top 10 schools.<p>3) Even during the boom times, when people from top schools were getting jobs at top BIGLAW firms left and right, people were HATING LIFE at the firm because they didn&#x27;t realize what it was going to be like. And more broadly, lots of people get all the way through law school and realize they don&#x27;t wanna be lawyers. This is super common.<p>4) Non-big-firm opportunities are either super competitive (like govt or public interest), super low paying (also includes lots of govt and public interest), or not a great value proposition (how&#x27;d you like 200k in debt to try scratching out 50k a year as a solo?)<p>Lots of the reasons people want to attend law school are pretty dumb/false (stuff like: like to argue, wanna be prestigious, think its a safe/good-paying career track). The people that should attend law school are those who:<p>a) won&#x27;t be financially ruined by the decision,<p>b) actually want to be a lawyer, and<p>c) have <i>some real sense of what being a lawyer actually means</i> (e.g. they spent at least a couple years working at a firm in some non-lawyer capacity, or they have a parent who was a lawyer and told them lots about their job, or they spent tons of their time researching law and legal practice. In other words their knowledge of legal practice is not based entirely on fictional TV and movie lawyers).<p>I&#x27;d say that describes under 1% of the people enrolled in law schools nationwide.",1408073111

They could run your HTML through a validator, look through your CSS, and evaluate your JS coding style at minimum.   They could also run the site through Pagespeed, or webpage test.

8180875,comment,8180473,8180473,1,0,bane,,,"Making new instruments is pretty hard stuff. One thing that I&#x27;ve noticed lots of new instruments seem to flake on is making the instruments really, <i>truly</i> expressive. At a simple level, most new instrument ideas I&#x27;ve seen seem to basically be a trigger sound on/off and if you&#x27;re lucky some kind of volume control and if you&#x27;re <i>really</i> lucky a pitch bend -- all tied into some kind of synth.<p>But most real instruments offer a tremendous amount of rich flexibility in performance. I grew up playing the violin and one of the reasons you don&#x27;t really hear good synth approximations of a string instrument is because on a real instrument there are thousands of subtly different ways of playing a given note. Subtle differences in attack, bowing, bow position, string position, pressure of your fingers on the strings, incredibly slight intonation changes, and on and on and on. I can say with some confidence that no two notes played on a violin will ever be exactly the same.<p>The example of the Continuum instrument is probably the most advanced I&#x27;ve ever seen, and even then there&#x27;s all kinds of flaws in the sound, bits that sound noticeably synthy -- and I can think of a few performance issues that this instrument can&#x27;t easily replicate. That&#x27;s not to say some other kind of sound wouldn&#x27;t be amazing (I was more impressed with the out and out synth sound than the string sound). They&#x27;ve tackled an impressive number of challenges.<p>This makes learning these kinds of instruments very hard, but it also means that they can be performed at incredibly advanced virtuoso levels.<p>This article does a good job at highlighting some of the major efforts to produce expressive instruments. It&#x27;s pretty exciting to me that technology has started to reach a point that really expressive instruments, capable of virtuoso level live performances have started to show up. My personal favorite is the Eigenharp, but it also has a little bit too much of a one-man-band aspect to it what with the mouthpiece and all.<p>One point that the article makes however is that these instruments are still remarkably rare to see. I think one of the problems is that they are hideously expensive for the most part. There&#x27;s no entry level cheapo middle-school music student version they can bang around on the bus like when you&#x27;re learning an acoustic instrument. I think my first violin cost $150, and I got $100 of that back when I traded it in for a better instrument.<p>Musicians, being notoriously poor, often simply can&#x27;t afford one of these things and thus can&#x27;t build mastery on them from a very young age.<p>Some examples:<p>Continuum - $3400 - $5300<p>Eigenharp - $4000 - $8260 (pico version is $800)<p>Seaboard - $2000 - $9000<p>Linnstrument - not sure, but looks like between $1000-2000<p>Still, as a musician, I find all of these far more interesting than something like Imogen Heap&#x27;s MIT medialab-like (of which I disliked everything I ever saw coming form there) wearable instrument tech.",1408071950
