I recently clustered all of our web logs on a monthly basis and found that, while e.g. summer months were clustered together (around releases and conferences typically) there were a couple of unexpected winter months in there too. The logs were too large to inspect for differences by hand - in this case it is more useful to cluster e.g. individual requests, or summaries tables of each month.<p>* Wesnoth is a great example of an open source game that continues to grow and develop and the team are friendly and welcoming. I can highly recommend contributing to it!",1408960795

Only 2% are hispanic and only 1% are black. Why are we ignoring this?

Have you ever expressed an opinion about politics, religion, terrorism, abortion or anything potentially divisive? Well in 10 years time the laws could have changed and those legal, innocent remarks you made 10 years ago could potentially land you in a lot of trouble.<p>What is legal and normal now may be illegal and dangerous later and the then government could go back and look for &quot;troublemakers&quot; by examining old data to check for subversive comments. Good luck explaining your comments from 15 years ago when you get dragged off to a secret court for &quot;terrorist&quot; behaviour based on comments and opinions of many years ago.<p>What about supposedly innocent tracking data. Suppose you had to visit the dentist several times in quick succession and suppose your dentist office was located very near to a known terrorist cell. Now you are in a database of people to watch. Several years later you have to make repeat visits to some other location which by sheer coincidence is near another terrorist cell. You are now a hot hit and this triggers a series of events starting with the IRS doing a full audit on you and your friends /family potentially followed by much worse.<p>This is not science fiction but easily plausible. The more data you have, the easier it is to establish causal relationships which are not real, but could have real consequences when some government or other organization takes an interest in you.",1408959755

If the project has 10 talents, they would each pitch in between $50-$100 to cover costs. In return, the talent ends with a film project they can add to their credentials and/or resumé.<p>I invite everyone to make this project in to an effective instrument for the creation of projects by utilizing talent and time that otherwise would have been a lost potential.<p>The web application is available at \nprodus.us<p>The iOS application is available at\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/produsus<p>The project is hosted on Github at\nhttps://github.com/aug2uag/produsus<p>Cheers.",1408957980

8221076,comment,8220500,8220684,5,0,netcan,,,"I think online &quot;course&quot; is a tricky self definition to start with.\nA more natural starting point is textbooks. IE MOOCs should aim to use technology to make textbooks 10X better. Textbooks can be used in the context of a university course or for self study. If they are good enough, they can enable new kinds of use cases.<p>Imagine that there was an online resource for math that is perfect. Lectures, exercises, hints, spaced learning, badges, etc. Everything from high school level studies to the math classes required for Science and engineering Masters degrees.<p>It&#x27;s so good that not creating your course around it is just being wasteful. You might be able to add value to that by creating a disciplined environment where people study in the same room or are required to have assignment X completed by 16:00 daily. Maybe you can improve (I suspect you can) on the results of self learning by adding in person tutoring.<p>At that point, a teacher might offer her own course. A 4-1 teacher to student ratio is much more affordable if you only need 5 hours per week. This is where the disruption comes from.<p>So basically I think that &quot;disrupting Universities&quot; is a kind of awkward way of thinking about this. It means online learning are looking at <i>universities</i> and asking themselves how can I replace this, instead of trying to do textbooks 2.0.",1408957544
