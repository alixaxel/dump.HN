I think that automating the sales process, from prospecting to closing will be a vertical that&#x27;ll see huge growth over the next few years. Anything that helps companies make money faster and integrates with salespeople&#x27;s existing workflows is an obvious winner. That&#x27;s the good news, the bad news is how low the barrier to entry for this market is right now and will continue to be with the current business model. The company that becomes the leader in this will work out how to make something that is seemingly highly commoditisable (email sending and read receipts) solidly defensible so the next startup down the block can&#x27;t just undercut you on number of prospects contacted per pricing tier. I suspect the answer will have more to do with more impressive mass personalisation rather than any network effects these companies can create.

An innovative solution which solves a real pain point for customers in a way which is differentiated from competitors. This competitive advantage would preferably be defensible. Hopefully it is in a large market which has capacity for exponential growth.
