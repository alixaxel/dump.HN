Perhaps you are referring to 10x of your optimal dose (i.e. if normally you take 200 ug, suddenly taking 2000 ug)<p>Regardless, I think it&#x27;s a bit of a stretch to suggest that, &quot;Toxicity is meaningless in the face of losing your mind&quot; - I had some pot brownies once, and went to a very twisted universe.

I think it has worked well for a few games, and as I said it makes perfect sense for something like ludum dare or just prototyping.<p>But when you want to polish your game and have a vision and/or a budget of any sort, I don&#x27;t see how the sfxr sound effects aren&#x27;t the first thing to go. Sfxr makes it all a lot simpler, but it sometimes strikes me as arrogant to use it for an otherwise polished product, since in my mind it means that these game developers don&#x27;t recognize that it isn&#x27;t trivial to create a good set of sound effects.<p>+1 on creating a tool that makes collaboration easier.

I&#x27;ve heard of the XCode version as well, but again, haven&#x27;t tried it.<p>That said, I have found ST + the Stino plugin[1] to be great for my arduino projects.  A good linter setup and gdb gives most of what I am looking for.  The convenience of debugging with an IDE that auto-populates watches based on context is nice, but rarely are these projects sizeable enough (for me) to need serious debugging.<p>Using Stino + ST (and turning off the Arduino code munging) gives a typical GCC compilation which requires everything you&#x27;d expect of a GCC compilation (proper declarations, prototypes, scoping, etc).<p>I can understand why forsaking function prototypes and adding type aliases (such as &#x27;boolean&#x27; usable for declarations in addition to &#x27;bool&#x27;) might make it easier for newcomers to learn to write &#x27;sketches.  But I am not sure it&#x27;s great in the long run.  So much of the Arduino code out there is poorly written, including some of the libraries I commonly see floating around.  And coming from me (who is far from part of the greybeard C/C++ master engineer cohort), that says a lot.<p>I think that the Arduino platform would likely benefit from a more natively supported &#x27;second step&#x27; development environment that encouraged better program organization and DRYness.  I can&#x27;t even count the number of arduino &#x27;sketches&#x27; I have seen out there that are a mess of static global const variables declared in 2000+ lines of completely spaghetti&#x27;d code.<p>Of course, I think it&#x27;s great Arduino is becoming so popular, I just wouldn&#x27;t mind seeing some nicer tools/educational resources for those new to it.<p>[1]<a href=""https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Robot-Will/Stino</a>",1407138176

The winning team &quot;created&quot; a device (that looked like a USB key).

I was horrified and when I approached the organizers afterwards they didn&#x27;t understand my explanation on why it was not possible.  Indeed, after that time as I have spoken about it most people do not understand that it&#x27;s not currently possible.

I suppose you&#x27;ve read some of the comments in this thread about R&D costs? Care to suggest how much this new government agency should get per year? Oh, and don&#x27;t forget, if you don&#x27;t give it enough funding, then you&#x27;re an &quot;evil bastard and you want people to die&quot;. And if you don&#x27;t give them enough extra every year, then you&#x27;re also an &quot;evil bastard and want sick children to die&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t really mean to say you&#x27;re an evil bastard or anything. But that is exactly the sort of arguments and public discourse that will crop up if such an agency were ever to be founded. And because &quot;cost&quot; or &quot;profit&quot; is not there anymore to temper the investment vs payout, the agency will end up being a funding black hole of guilt.<p>Sure, giving everyone access to health life is a noble ideal. But as I&#x27;ve said before, illness and death never end and we&#x27;re fighting a losing game if we intend on beating it with public money.

8130685,comment,8129454,8130626,22,0,lchengify,,,"I wrote pharma software for a few years focusing on small molecule drug discovery, and did academic research on structural based drug discovery of allosterics.<p>Different companies do it differently, but the customers I had went through a series of steps.  I&#x27;ll try to summarize them briefly here.<p>1. Target choice:  Typically research focuses on a single &quot;target&quot;.  In small molecules, this is typically a protein that you want to activate somehow to change a biological pathway.  For other sub-fields, such as biologics, &quot;target&quot; can mean other things.<p>2. Iteration / core choice: You start with a small organic molecule &quot;core&quot; that can be the backbone of your drug.  Molecules with similar cores can &quot;fit&quot; into similar places, whereas active groups that branch off of the core affect their efficacy.<p>3. Screening / lead optimization: Pharma companies have libraries of chemical structures, their properties, and how they fit into certain proteins.  The idea is to find a molecule with a core that will fit, and active groups that will make the drug &#x27;plug&#x27; the active site of the protein. When doing drug discovery, there are all sorts properties you care about, ranging from pka to toxicity.  \n- For many drugs, there is experimental data that is available.  For other drugs, experiments must be performed to obtain data.  At this stage it basically becomes a data problem for the chemist.  Lots of time looking at pivot tables of raw experiment data, 2d molecule structures, 3d structures, computational predictive results, etc.  The idea is to to find holes in the data where potential molecules with the right core and active groups could have matching properties, etc. \n- A lot of it is data based, but a lot of it is also intuitive.\n- There are other sources of data other than assays (experiments).  One of the most useful is X-Ray crystallography images, which are 3D images of molecules in active sites.<p>4. Discovery Candidate: At some point (hopefully) you reach the stage where you&#x27;re pretty sure a drug has good properties.  This is when you lock down the IP, not just by patenting that molecule, but all other molecules that are similar.  Basically &quot;putting it in a box&quot; to start the more expensive animal / human testing.<p>5. POST-IND FDA approval process.  You can read about this here [1], but basically this is where the expensive / time consuming fun begins.  Animal tests, efficacy tests on humans, etc.  This is pretty expensive but also well defined by the FDA<p>Note that I am far from an expert, some of the people I worked with had done this for decades and would probably correct me and / or point out steps I&#x27;m missing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm143534.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/consumers/ucm143534...</a>",1407136417
