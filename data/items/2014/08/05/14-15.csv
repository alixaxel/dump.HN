There&#x27;s still room to improve, and iOS 8 tools are a huge help.<p>I agree with you. The iOS market is maturing. It&#x27;s no longer a gold-rush of simple one-off apps.

Outside of gaming, I&#x27;d expect most apps to have other functionality that can be processed and accessed with in other ways beyond solely a mobile interface.<p>To that end, the mobile app experience doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be &#x27;high-caliber&#x27; over and above all the other competition, as long as the rest of the supporting functionality provides enough value.<p>I may entirely wrong though...",1407250676

Once a year? Maybe twice if you are lucky. Then how many users are actually applying all updates? Probably very few.<p>I would further contend that a nas-in-a-box like this can never be secure. The vendor isn&#x27;t going to update it frequently enough -- not enough users will actually update -- they are likely using old out-dated/insecure versions of various open source projects or worse, crudely hacked together proprietary projects to run the webserver, webui, ssl layer, authentication, etc. By now, the manufacturer has probably already back-burnered this device and moved onto newer models, or will be shortly -- completely abandoning all the current users who will get stuck with a swiss-cheese-in-a-box.<p>I&#x27;ll go further and content the only safe and secure way to do this is to go with something like FreeNAS or OwnCloud. Both are current projects with massive user-bases. Both are FOSS projects, and both have a corporate backing if you need support or more enterprise features. Both stay very up-to-date with bugfixes, security fixes, and new features rolling out often.

8137095,comment,8136670,8136932,5,0,seren,,,"I would suggest Glen Cook&#x27;s Black company series[1] It is written from the perspective of mercenary grunts, so they are no &quot;heroes&quot; in the usual sense since they are not always hired by the good guys (and it is hard to real divide the world between good and bad, it is more a greyish blur). It also has the kind of gritty feeling of ASOFAI, at least in the first books. I won&#x27;t spoil anything by saying that most characters are pretty expendables, the body count is rather high.<p>It is fantasy but without the usual dwarves, elves or dragons, but there are much more magic than in Georges R.R. Martin and it is sometimes used as <i>deus ex machina</i>, and is a bit over top for my taste. (However in an interesting twist the black company has only a handful of not very powerful wizards, and since they can&#x27;t overpower the enemy though sheer power, their magic use is basically used as form of advanced misdirection or psyops)<p>I would say that the writing is a bit simpler and the characters are a bit less fleshed out than in ASOFAI, but the pace is pretty riveting as well. From my recollection, it reads more like a mystery novel, most events do not make immediately sense, and you are trying to find out who is really pulling the strings behind the scene. On the plus side, even if it is long, I think the story is more focused and go less astray than ASOFAI. (I enjoyed GRR Martin books, but sometimes it feels like he can&#x27;t help adding new characters or subplots for no particular good reason)<p>IIRC it is/was pretty popular amongst soldiers stationed overseas.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Cook#The_Black_Company"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Cook#The_Black_Company</a><p>PS : If I was a television exec, I would try to secure the rights for a TV adaptation ASAP.

It is certainly the case that when someone purchases one of a series of works, unless it is of a nature that it&#x27;s expected to continue indefinitely (E.G. any given Marvel comic for example) people generally expect that at some point in the future the series will conclude. At a bare minimum they expect the current story arc to be resolved in something approaching a satisfactory way (for varying values of satisfactory).<p>Importantly there is no guarantee of when precisely that conclusion will be provided, or truly a guarantee it will be provided at all, but there is certainly the expectation. Further once an author has set a known &quot;pace&quot; to his writing people tend to expect him to continue that pace (rightly so or not), so when he massively deviates from that pace people tend to take notice. E.G. if an author were to publish 3 books in a series, one every year, and then suddenly go 4 or 5 years before publishing the next book in the series people would most likely be very angry with that author (wrongly or not, it&#x27;s more a question of human nature).<p>So no, while the author is not in fact their &quot;bitch&quot; as Neil Gaiman puts it, there is a certain expectation on both sides, namely the audience expects the work to be concluded at some point in the future and for work to be released at something approaching a regular schedule, while the author should then also have the reasonable expectation that those purchasing his books will continue to do so in the future.

Now, bullying and cyberbullying are a serious problem, and there&#x27;s no doubt about that. However, cyberbullying doesn&#x27;t occur because apps like Secret exist; there are other forces at play here.<p>Now, should companies like Secret ENABLE cyberbullying to happen? Of course not! But should they sensor what goes up onto their service? I don&#x27;t think so. There are features which they can implement (if they haven&#x27;t already) which can be used to allow users to flag certain content as being abusive, and repeat offenders can be permabanned. That seems like a more appropriate course of action from Secret, instead of sensoring what their users put up on their service, which is what many critics seems to be advocating for.<p>Now, I haven&#x27;t used Secret in a very long time (doesn&#x27;t seem all that popular with my group of friends), but I&#x27;m fairly certain that they provide users the ability to flag inappropriate content.

I don&#x27;t even pretend to understand most of the fundamental science, but my very cursory studies show that long-term vegan diets are pretty much a terrible idea for humans, despite what vegan advocacy literature proclaims, there are no populations of humans on the planet that go for a lifetime (or generations) on a purely vegan diet. Most of the ones used as examples, have some animal sources in their diet but those sources are not recorded or well understood by outside observers who are also biased by trying to advocate for a particularly philosophical dietary proscription.<p>Just with respect to the B group vitamins, there&#x27;s quite a few studies of vegan populations that show a consistent deficit in B12. Depending on the study, vegan populations consistently show (at 70-90% of the studied population) B12 deficits, even while taking supplements. The general conclusion among nutritionists is that it&#x27;s very <i>very</i> hard for vegans to get enough B12 in their diets no matter what they try. Strangely, these studies never seem to show up in Vegan advocacy circles or support groups, though there is a general awareness that B12 availability is a problem with the diet. More problematic, B12 deficiency (and the related issues below) do not present as immediate health issues, but develop over years and decades - presenting as permanent damage to neurological tissues. People who switch to Vegan diets often don&#x27;t present with this deficiency for several years as the liver maintains a 3-5 year store of the vitamin.<p>B12 deficiency can be fatal. B12 deficiency is trivially treated by eating meat - surprisingly little meat too. Similar studies of Vegetarian populations who occasionally eat <i>some</i> animal source, don&#x27;t show nearly as frequent B12 deficiencies as in Vegan populations.<p>Identifying B12 deficiency can be difficult as normal assays don&#x27;t reliably show deficiencies, and initial symptoms looks like anemia, which is also highly prevalent among vegan dieters and may co-present.<p>Along with B12 deficiency, elevated methylmalonic acid is typical in some majority of the studied vegan populations. Which is used as a secondary signal to confirm B12 deficiency. MMA reacts with B12 to produce coenzyme A (CoA) which is necessary for normal cell function. People with elevated MMA are often diagnosed with methylmalonic acidemia - a group of disorders which are normally only seen in infants with specific genetic conditions relevant to B12 absorption, but present with progressive encephalopathy and hyperammonemia, both can cause death over the long-term.<p>A majority of vegans can also usually be diagnosed with Hyperhomocysteinemia (which is only ever seen in three population groups, the severely malnourished, the extreme elderly and vegans and is trivially treated with an omnivorous diet). Studies which show cardiovascular issues in Vegans (surprisingly more common than you&#x27;d think) attribute them to Hyperhomocysteinemia as Homocysteine prevents proper formation and maintenance of key cardiovascular components like collagen and elastin (also noticeable in Vegan populations as &quot;thin skin&quot; or &quot;premature wrinkling&quot;). It&#x27;s also linked to Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Schizophrenia. The later disease occurs in vegan populations with a startlingly higher frequency than in vegetarian and omnivorous dieter populations.<p>This is just <i>some</i> of the issues from B12 deficiency, which occurs somewhere between 70-90% of any randomly selected vegan population. So we <i>know</i> that vegans, as a general population, are not able to supply themselves with sufficient B12.<p>You can probably google for the relevant studies on your own. There&#x27;s plenty of them around, but I&#x27;d urge you to find them in medical journals, not interpreted through vegan advocacy sites which seem to have a habit of ignoring the important health issues and suppressing negative health outcomes from the diet.<p>I&#x27;d urge you to check out amino acids, and fatty acid issues as well, as they are just as common in vegan populations and can be just as health concerning.<p>Interestingly, almost every single health issue that stems from a vegan diet is trivially treated by just eating a few grams of animal protein sources a week. Eating plant foods or supplements rich in these normally vegan deficient nutrients doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re bioavailable, what matters is absorption of the relevant nutrient, which is something that vegan diets are notoriously poor in providing.<p>Here&#x27;s something I wrote on this a while ago. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6888323"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6888323</a>",1407248299

8136982,comment,8134079,8136642,0,0,coriny,,,"&quot;Its pretty much the same as &quot;Perl hate&quot;, why do we hate Perl? No reason at all, other then being cool means hating Perl!&quot;<p>Ummm, no. Believe me, having worked in a PERL shop for nearly 10 years, I was ecstatic to start working in Java (!). And I have zero regrets. It&#x27;s nothing to do with being &quot;cool&quot; or any other pointless patronising insults to other developers. It&#x27;s that badly written PERL is the worst excrement ever to have been smeared on a computer screen. Yes it can be clean, clear and readable, but only in the hands of an experienced expert (using &quot;modern PERL&quot;, which only started to exist ~6-8 years ago) backed by stringent code review and consistent team practice. Without the infrastructure in place, you end up with reams of unmaintainable, slow, buggy, eye bleed code. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of PERL from plenty of projects and plenty of different developers in different institutions and companies and the vast, vast majority is crap.<p>The last bit of code I had to rewrite (5 years effort by a weak PERL coder, replaced in 3 months in Java, maintained by someone with no previous Java experience quite happily) would have made you cry. I have never seen anything like it in any language (note, I don&#x27;t work with PHP either), and I don&#x27;t believe such a steaming mess would be possible in any other modern programming language, let alone from someone who had been a professional programmer for 10 years.<p>To me, your attitude is the problem the PERL community has. The language deserved the bad reputation. Until modern PERL appeared, it was almost impossible for a beginner to produce anything like good code. It is possible now (I have seen beautiful clean PERL), but instead of trying to educate and bring people back to the fold, the community has a massive chip on its shoulder, refuses to admit the problems PERL has (still), or that it ever had any, and proceed to insult everyone else. If PERL hadn&#x27;t learnt from the trends in other languages (esp a decent OO system, Moose), it would be literally dead by now.",1407248271

It&#x27;s the only way to get the performance. As an abstraction it&#x27;s already great and I don&#x27;t feel I need another abstraction on top of it.<p>An example of the kind of query that an ORM is bad at:<p><pre><code>    SELECT id\n          ,value_from_row_based_functions(some_column) AS foo\n      FROM bar\n     WHERE some_column = &#x27;blah&#x27;\n     ORDER BY id DESC\n     FETCH FIRST 25 ROWS ONLY\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s bad because the ORM will merrily do this even though the row based function may be expensive. Over hundreds of rows this isn&#x27;t an issue, but over millions or tens of millions it kills your query (if it doesn&#x27;t timeout it will merrily carry on for hours).<p>Good SQL always reduces the amount of work involved, you tailor it as you would your regular code to avoid doing work that isn&#x27;t needed (reading rows you will discard through a filter, etc).<p>The above could be written as:<p><pre><code>    SELECT id\n          ,value_from_row_based_functions(some_column) AS foo\n      FROM (\n                SELECT id\n                      ,some_column\n                  FROM bar\n                 WHERE some_column = &#x27;blah&#x27;\n                 ORDER BY id DESC\n                 FETCH FIRST 25 ROWS ONLY\n           ) AS something\n</code></pre>\nAnd now the row based function is only applied to the 25 rows that are going to be returned.<p>If you look at the very bottom of this: <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/textsearch-controls.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/textsearch-control...</a> you&#x27;ll see this is a real-world problem.<p>ORMs can stitch together your SQL in a certain way that is fairly optimal for most common scenarios... but you <i>will</i> encounter a scenario in which raw SQL is the only way to go.",1407247900

The problem I see is that the Dart language developers never put them self in the shoes of the developer using their languaje.<p>In this case, I would be easy for them to add JSON serialization to objects, you know, but they didn&#x27;t, why? polictics, apathy, whatever, but not technical problems.<p>So, my self, had to adapt to programming in Dart, so I every class must have a toJSON and fromJSON methods where I manually put the values to a map and then I use convert.JSON. But, I now I gave up using classes and now I just use Maps, just to write less code and is already the type Dart suppor for JSON serialization.",1407247621
