8183861,comment,8183172,8183533,2,0,swalsh,,,"Ah, but that&#x27;s the hard part.  Capitalism does provide some benefits.  For example it is magnificent for encouraging economic growth, which for most of the world is essential.  There are still large swaths of the global population living in poverty in first world and third world situations.<p>What I believe will happen is most of the world will look like china.  If you were to look at them maybe 10 years ago, what you would see is economic growth fueled by cheap exports.  Today, they are starting to see a middle class stable enough to support their own economy.  Global trade is still essential, but it is now only a part of the pie, rather than the whole pie.  At the same time you&#x27;ll seeing a middle class grow in china, we&#x27;re starting to see manufacturing move out of the country searching for cheaper pastures.<p>I think its a model that will repeat itself across the world.  First comes a improved political environment, than a hearty shipping infrastructure is created, and then business and global trade starts.  Repeat.<p>I believe capitalism won&#x27;t be replaced, it&#x27;ll fade away.",1408132753

Somewhere really nice in the American Sotuhwest is maybe like 400 watts per square meter.  At 25% efficiency, to equal the baseline load of a 1 GW nuclear power plant, you need something like 7.7 square miles of panel area when you factor in the need to capture enough sun during the day and store it for the night.  You need to also have a high voltage DC grid to ship the electricity from the Desert to where we need it, and much better storage systems to hold the load for the night.  Basically Solar is never going to work for baseline load, and to top it all off photovoltaics are dirty as hell to make.  Wind is even more bad (There was a study that said you needed 270 square miles of land to generate 1 GW reliably), and hydroelectric is limited in where we can deploy it.

Tools are better at being authoritative but can only find vulns of a given type. For example static analysis is a great fit for any vuln that boils down to a dataflow problem, user controlled source -> ... -> dangerous sink. XSS, sql injection, etc fit this model. Fuzzers are great at finding bugs in parsers (and there are a surprising amount of parsers in the world, 90% of which should never have been written). Instrumented dynamic analysis can do awesome work for memory issues. I explain all this to show there are areas where tools are fantastic for their area. But there are many areas for which tools cannot help at all, heartbleed was one of these areas.<p>The best security tools available were (presumably) run across openssl before and (certainly) with increased scrutiny after heartbleed. None of them found it. Simple limitations in static analysis lead me to believe they would never have found it on their own (most static analysis tools stop at 5 levels of indirection) Some background:<p>1. <a href=""http://blog.trailofbits.com/2014/04/27/using-static-analysis-and-clang-to-find-heartbleed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.trailofbits.com/2014/04/27/using-static-analysis...</a>\n2. <a href=""http://security.coverity.com/blog/2014/Apr/on-detecting-heartbleed-with-static-analysis.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.coverity.com/blog/2014/Apr/on-detecting-hear...</a>\n3. <a href=""http://www.grammatech.com/blog/finding-heartbleed-with-codesonar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grammatech.com/blog/finding-heartbleed-with-codes...</a><p>If you have immature projects sure run tools against it and some bugs will shake out.

However, it is easy to imagine small corrections that could lead to a ∼ 4% deviation from scale-invariance, especially given that bulk temperature is so close (i.e. ∼ 20% of) the 5D Planck temperature. In the context of our model, the red tilt of the cosmological power spectrum implies that the amplitude of 5D bulk graviton propagator, which enters in Eq.

I&#x27;ve been in gravitational orbit around the SF Bay Area my entire working life. (For a majority of the past 6 years, I&#x27;ve spent 1 to 2 weeks a month in SF.)<p>The standard arguments for starting a company in California is:\n1) You&#x27;ll be closer to venture capital.\n2) You&#x27;ll be closer to talent.\n3) You&#x27;ll be closer to customers.<p>1) If you want or need venture capital, then it helps to play by their rules. One rule is: &quot;Locate your company&#x27;s headquarters within an hour&#x27;s drive of my office.&quot; In my opinion, this is stupid and short-sighted, but from their perspective, it kinda makes sense. Giving you capital means (most likely) also sitting on your board of directors. And if those board meetings only require a short drive (instead of flying), then their life is easier. Also, if they&#x27;re giving you a ton of money (many millions, perhaps), they&#x27;ll sleep better at night knowing you&#x27;re close by and can meet in person at any time.<p>2) Access to talent is closely related to access to capital. VCs will want to give you money only if you want to get big and make billions of dollars. (AKA: Are you the next Google, Facebook, or Apple?) The implication is that if you&#x27;re going to scale big, you&#x27;re going to need a ton of employees. If you&#x27;re based in the middle of nowhere, your growth potential is limited to the size of your local talent pool. Again, I think this argument is silly and short-sited. But I&#x27;ve heard VCs make this argument directly to me in the past.<p>3) It generally makes sense to be close to your customers, especially early on when you don&#x27;t have any. If you&#x27;re a software company selling to other software companies, it might make sense to be based in San Francisco, regardless of how expensive it is to operate there. (You&#x27;re going to make billions, anyway, right?) If your early customer is the U.S. Government, it might make sense to be primarily based near D.C. If your customer is the media, it might make sense to be based in New York or Los Angeles. If you can argue that there isn&#x27;t a central cluster city of potential customers for your business (or you can argue that it doesn&#x27;t matter), then it&#x27;s less likely you&#x27;ll need to move to be closer to them.<p>This is how I plan to do my next startup given the above three arguments:\n1) Don&#x27;t plan on needing VC. Bootstrap and get to profitability as quickly as possible. Then I won&#x27;t have to play by VC rules and move closer to them.\n2) Don&#x27;t plan on needing to grow big. Plan on hiring people wherever they are, and create a remote-friendly working environment.\n3) Live near an airport. As long as I&#x27;m close to an airport with lots of direct flights, I can visit potential customers whenever/wherever I want. (This is why I&#x27;d rather be in Chicago near O&#x27;Hare Airport, than live in the middle of Kansas, for example.)<p>However, I still might move back to the Bay Area someday. But I&#x27;d only do so for personal reasons - e.g. being closer to family and access to awesome hiking trails.<p>[edit: spelling and grammar]",1408130186

I&#x27;m sure most HNers are in the top 90th percentile of US household income on their own, living in a world mostly surrounded by other affluent individuals working in a similar field, all in jobs with increasingly flexible work hours, better benefits and nearly unlimited job prospects.<p>The world only looks like it&#x27;s moving towards post-scarcity because the resources consumed and waste produced have been nearly completely outsourced away, and the pangs of the labor issues created by automation are happening somewhere else.<p>Post-scarcity is not an issue of &#x27;productivity&#x27; but of resource use. As Jevons paradox [0] points out the more efficiently we use resources the more of them we tend to use. Looking merely at productivity and efficiency without looking at resource use and waste production gives a wildly incomplete picture of &quot;post-scarcity&quot;. What I see is that the world is increasingly separating into a small sub-population that is presented the illusion of post-scarcity and a another, growing, subset that is feeling the effects of scarcity required to maintain that illusion.<p>When I see data to support the argument that resource use and waste production are plummeting, then I&#x27;ll believe in narratives about post-scarcity.<p>0. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox</a>",1408129901
