It is good for really quick and dirty proof of concept things for devices, but for fully fledged mobile apps on iOS and android, there is an enormous gap in terms of performance. In order to get performance at least on par with native, you&#x27;d have to sacrifice TONS in terms of user experience.<p>Want gestures? You&#x27;ll have to look towards things like iScroll and hammer.js, which work &quot;sometimes&quot;. Add that to framework issues, and momentum based scrolling that you will have to implement yourself numerous times... Oh boy. Basically, things that come out of the box on native will have to be manually implemented by yourself, and none of these solutions will even come close to native experiences.<p>Add this to the fact that phonegap documentation is all over the place, and all you will get are senseless headaches. Save yourself the frustration of hacking the web into a mobile device and go native all the way. You will thank your self later.",1408125474

I work 100% on 1099, I buy my own health insurance, and I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying you if the service was a net gain for me.<p>My thoughts:<p>1) The sign up form has a First________Last name field. I thought I would tab from First and land on a hidden Last field because of the gap between the two. Tabbing just moved me down to the next set of fields.

The question that matters is which of the two produces people with skills more widely valuable to society.

Brewdog, Euston tap, the skaters at South Bank, etc. are all good attractions. I also strongly support the congestion charge. Land is expensive, and letting automobiles drive all over it subsidizes drivers at the expense of the pedestrian (or cyclist). Ideally it would be so expensive to drive in the city center we could take a lane or two away from cars and give them to other road users, but I guess this is a pipe dream.

I do &quot;wash&quot; my hair with just water once or twice a week and will occasionally use a &quot;shampoo bar&quot; (basically what this article is selling, but in bar form and much cheaper) when my hair is getting really greasy or there&#x27;s someone I&#x27;m trying to impress and I need the &quot;squeaky clean&quot; look.<p>I used to have massive problems with dandruff and hair that was so greasy that I needed to wash it every morning, but that&#x27;s not nearly as much of a problem anymore. Right now, it&#x27;s been about a week since I&#x27;ve done anything to my hair (well I&#x27;ve combed) and it doesn&#x27;t feel hardly at all greasy.

Good, old fashioned soap, being the saponified byproduct of oils and an alkali.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong; I&#x27;m a big believer in natural soap over chemical detergents. Detergents don&#x27;t generally distinguish between the oils in your hair and the lipids in your skin&#x27;s cellular membranes, which causes a lot of irritation in many people, and is probably disruptive to your scalp&#x27;s natural oil production and conditioning process.<p>Be that as it may, I don&#x27;t see anything in this list of ingredients that is some sort of groundbreaking revolution. This isn&#x27;t &quot;a world without shampoo.&quot; This is a world without SLS/SLES/SCS and its various derivatives and equivalents. Good, yes. Gamechanging, not really.<p>For whatever it&#x27;s worth, I highly recommend soap for hair. Not your run of the mill bar soap, which is probably not soap at all, but a compressed brick of detergents. I mean natural soap. Buying this company&#x27;s stuff is one way to go. Buying the same product, at a presumably cheaper price, is another.

So by using this service, you suddenly have great potential for individuals at three other corporations to heavily influence your ability to do business and remain profitable, either through data loss, downtime, or the aforementioned security breach.<p>I haven&#x27;t even mentioned the issue of data privacy here - it seems quite common for modern SaaS startups to rely on VC funding to offset the costs of providing their service, with the vague notion of &quot;if you build it, they will come... and then we can somehow turn them/the information we hold on them into a profit&quot;",1408123768

The coverage and availability of the public transportation system is much better in New York (the MTA runs 24 hours). In addition, the bridges are shorter and thus easier to bike or walk over. The length of the Bay Bridge is a kilometer more than the combined lengths of the Brooklyn, Manhattan & Williamsburg bridges, all of which connect Brooklyn & Manhattan.

None at all.<p>New York has a legitimate demand problem, seeing as it&#x27;s the capital of the world.<p>California has an <i>artificial</i> demand problem due to NIMBYs who corrupt zoning boards, oppose reasonable development at every turn, and live in the past while paying lip service to &quot;building the future&quot;.<p>(It also has a problem with corrupt/dirty foreign money swelling into the housing market, but that&#x27;s an issue in New York as well.)<p>New York has solid public transportation. You don&#x27;t need a car if you live there. People bitch about the MTA, but it&#x27;s remarkably cheap compared to having a car anywhere in the US, and remarkably convenient considering how much access it provides.<p>San Francisco is a city where you need a car, but can&#x27;t afford it. Parking costs are so bad that many garages post their <i>15 minute</i> rates (often around $3.00).<p>New York is hard-core urban and owns the positives and negatives that comes from it, and New York runs itself. San Francisco companies are run from the suburbs-- specifically, from an office park called &quot;Sand Hill Road&quot; in a stretch of land that really ought to be reclaimed by the cows and orange trees, because the people living there are contributing nothing but additional work for the sewer system.<p>Manhattan is what it is, take it or leave it. (And there&#x27;s nothing wrong with leaving it.) California is fundamentally dishonest and hypocritical, because it&#x27;s full of people who pretend to be liberal but are, in many ways, worse than the Manhattan old board when it comes to elitism.<p>New York isn&#x27;t perfect. There&#x27;s a lot that&#x27;s badly designed or unpleasant about it, but if you compare it to the cataclysmic mismanagement of California at all levels, it&#x27;s a breath of fresh air.",1408122133
