And TV says being a lawyer can only lead to good things.  Moreover, most bizarro-land parents will agree with the television set.<p>There was a Congressional study in bizarro-land a number of years back.  The title went something like: &quot;Bizarro-land.  Can we sue our way to prosperity?&quot;<p>There will always be lots of litigation in bizarro-land.  Because that is how they do business.  When business succeeds, they sue.  When business fails, they sue.   Litigation is itself big business.<p>If you read HN, then you know about the USPTO.  The bizarro-land government issues rights to sue called patents and trademarks.  Needless to say, these rights to sue are extremely popular there; probably more popular in bizarro-land than anywhere else in the world.  Why?  In bizarro-land, one can never have too many potential lawsuits ready to file.<p>Can we sue our way to prosperity?  &quot;Yes, we can.&quot;<p>There can never be too many lawyers in bizarro-land.<p>I hope in DK that the taxes people pay go back to the people in some form.<p>Because in bizarro-land the taxes people pay go to businesses that would otherwise fail.  Banks get &quot;bailed out&quot;.  Universities go after the student loan programs (as mentioned in the article).  Pharmaceutical companies go after the medical benefits programs.  And so on.  Consumers can no longer afford the overpriced products and services of these failing businesses, so the businesses go after the government coffers: get the government to pay for them!<p>Denmark is one of the better countries you could live in anywhere in the world.

8181108,comment,8177755,8179995,1,0,glenra,,,"> <i>Do you think that women are intellectually flawed? [...] If no, what is your best guess why they are underrepresented?</i><p>My best guess is that relevant male math-type skills have a higher <i>variance</i> than female math-type skills. That means that even if the <i>average</i> ability is about the same, there are more men than women at the very top of the skill distribution and ALSO at the very bottom of the skill distribution. If you look for math morons, you&#x27;ll find more men; if you look for math geniuses, you&#x27;ll find more men. If you look for people with roughly average math ability, you&#x27;ll find more women. If the variance is even a LITTLE larger, it can explain an arbitrarily large imbalance at the high end, and we have both (some) statistical evidence that it IS larger and plausible biological reasons to expect that it MIGHT be larger.<p>Women have two X chromosomes; men only have one. All the important stuff that makes us human is on the X chromosome. So for the sake of intuition, let us imagine that there were only THREE available genes for math ability, all equally prevalent in the population, and any X chromosome you inherit includes one (and only one!) of these three &quot;math ability&quot; genes. The genes are:<p>(1) &quot;moron&quot; (recessive)<p>(2) &quot;genius&quot; (recessive)<p>(3) &quot;average&quot; (dominant)<p>In that world, men would have a 1 in 3 chance of being a genius and women would have a 1 in 9 chance of being a genius.<p>Similarly, men would have a 1 in 3 chance of being a moron and women would have a 1 in 9 chance of being a moron.<p>In that world, having two X chromosomes makes women &quot;more average&quot; than men, which means that if some career requires the &quot;math genius&quot; gene, that career will be 75% male.<p>Does that all make sense?<p>Okay, now let&#x27;s suppose that &quot;genius&quot; gene is a bit more rare. Let&#x27;s say that only 10% of X chromosomes have the &quot;potential math genius&quot; gene. In that case, men would outnumber women 10-to-1 instead of 3-to-1 in professions requiring it. The rarer that gene is, so long as that gene is either <i>recessive</i> or to some degree <i>averages out</i> with its counterpart on the other X chromosome, it will be hugely rarer that women fully express the properties that gene codes for.<p>If this analysis is valid, it suggests that women are less likely to be at the very TOP of math-related fields (or will have to work a lot harder to get there) for essentially the same reason women are far less likely than men are to be colorblind.<p>(relevant study: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7604277"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7604277</a> )",1408080715

8181080,comment,8180473,8180875,1,0,diydsp,,,"I&#x27;m an instrument designer (Ambient Addition, One-Bit Groovebox, Exertion Instruments, PSPKick, etc.) and you&#x27;re right.  Jaron Lanier in the OP is right.<p>Traditional instruments evolved around expressivity of physical phenomena; particular configurations of vibrations.<p>Electronics (and computers) are great for information, but information doesn&#x27;t resonate at audible frequencies, and it doesn&#x27;t respond to human movement.  Yes, theremin - but it&#x27;s two-dimensional and it&#x27;s not a physical system of the same species.  it&#x27;s an isolated physical oscillation with severely constrained external influence.<p>Synthesizers sound great, but only through heaps of patch design and only modulars begin to bring tangible structure that any simple string instrument has.  And even then, players aren&#x27;t manipulating the electricity in its own medium, but operating at an abstraction.  Modern music has now nearly completely re-inherited the legacy of personal computing and thus we have one-man workstation music.<p>You&#x27;re doubly and triply right about that awful trope of the one-man band and more importantly about the price scales of instruments, beginning cheap for kids who have more time and imagination than money.<p>My current approach is to regress to guitar-like instruments outfitted with embedded synthesizers.  I recently showed one at a gallery show embedded in a cigar box.  It doesn&#x27;t have exhaustive sensors (only pressure and pitch), but it has other affordances which yank electronic music back into the domain of open-ended interpersonal vibration as opposed to vending machines for dance music .aiff files :)<p>Expressivity is often overly-focused on multi-modal, high resolution sensor inputs when it&#x27;s really more about the ability and freedom to respond to the energy of a performance.  Glove controllers usually fall down for the same reasons: they merely map a few parameters of an intricate process to cartesian movement like slot-car racetracks with no means to fail or they suffer from a lack of feedback - a symptom they share in all computer user interface applications - or they&#x27;re simply <i>too</i> general and users (vs. musicans, ha!) spend all their configuring and no time rockin&#x27;.<p>Individual virtuosos aren&#x27;t as important to me as seeing small groups of electronic musicians in true collaborative performance.  My best example so far was in fact made with Imogen Heap&#x27;s collaborator Kelly Snook:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNgyMfH3E9Q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNgyMfH3E9Q</a>   A less precise, but larger group is here: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDYabnu10qk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDYabnu10qk</a>",1408079486
