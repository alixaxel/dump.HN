A kids educational outcome would become linked to that of their parents and other adults in their environment, even more so than is currently the case.<p>In fact it&#x27;s worse than that , because as soon as one generation messes up because for example a parent develops a mental health issue there is no mechanism for fixing the next generation.",1408269435

I had a younger family member who had to miss a few weeks of school and stay home. After a few days he was itching to get back for the sole reason of social interaction. If you don&#x27;t go to school you see your friends for maybe 1 hour in the evening. If you go you see them for 20mins on the bus to school, in-between classes, 45 mins of recess per day, and the 20 min bus ride home. Not to mention the interaction during group activities or lulls in classes. If everyone was homeschooled there would need to be a substitute for this and suggestions I&#x27;ve seen like &quot;all parents should take their kids to the park for an hour&quot; don&#x27; suffice. I think the length of the interaction isn&#x27;t important, the fact that it happens throughout the day is.

This will allow you to prototype faster (and reiterate faster as you learn from your customers). This would also play in to how you approach building the back end.<p>From reading your replies to other comments, it sounds like you want access to a phone&#x27;s local resources, and you are possibly interested in using web technologies. I would look into Apache Cordova (aka PhoneGap) or something similar (there are many). This allows you to build once with HTML/CSS/JS, and then distribute via Android/iOS and more (differentiation being each platform would need specific front end JS code to access the phone&#x27;s local resources). This approach is commonly used in conjunction with a back end that accepts API Requests (aka front end makes Ajax request, back end responds with Data). I&#x27;m using this approach for one of my current projects.",1408266439

You laid out an IF and a THEN with no relation whatsoever between the two.<p>IF I can fly a plane, THEN I can make a sandwich. This is the equivalent statement. The virtual therapist being better than a real therapist does not automatically mean that a person can treat themselves any more than an insulin pump means a diabetic can cure themselves.<p>Again, I agree with you about the lack of scientific rigour in psychology. The issue is you completely mischaracterizing logic and science. You&#x27;re being dishonest.",1408266362

8188974,comment,8187106,8187106,5,0,millstone,,,"The &quot;Symphony of Functions&quot; example is worth dissecting, since it&#x27;s a good example of when NOT to use an Option monad.<p>The code computes sqrt(-1 * (log(-1 * (20 * 2)))^2).<p>The potentially failing functions are log and sqrt. Failure is determined by checking if the result is a &quot;normal&quot; floating point value. But &#x27;double&#x27; and &#x27;square&#x27; may also produce non-normal values, e.g. squaring a large float may produce infinity. So why doesn&#x27;t double() return an Option as well?<p>Furthermore, checking if a value is normal is not correct. If x slightly exceeds 1, then log x is a small positive value, i.e. a denormal, and therefore log() will incorrectly report failure.<p>Floating point arithmetic already has a serviceable &quot;Option&quot; type in its non-finite values (NaN and infinities), so the best way to write this code is the naive way:<p><pre><code>    let result: f64 = sqrt(pow(-1 * (log(-1 * (20 * 2))), 2));\n    let success: bool = is_finite(result);\n</code></pre>\nThe Option monad only makes this code longer, slower, and buggier.",1408266245
