The fact that it returns undefined in some edge cases is a bug.  If you want to be nice about it, you can approach them and explain the upcoming behavior change as a heads up, however it&#x27;s still a bug that should be fixed.<p>2.  No sympathy for those projects here;  you can&#x27;t use undocumented/private interfaces and expect them to be officially supported.  I do it myself, however I do it with full knowledge that every single version change is potentially breaking to me, and I make sure to have unit tests to confirm the behavior still exists in X version.  I may also approach the project and say something like &quot;Hey, I found using X undocumented interface is actually really useful, how can we expose this as an official thing?&quot;",1409374727

8245688,comment,8241191,8243202,1,0,lotharbot,,,"You left out another option:<p>3) you update your methods for <i>understanding</i> the text, instead of relying on methods developed in the early 1900s [0].  Figure out what concept the original writing was really trying to communicate by studying the history of the origin of the text, the culture and surrounding cultures, etc.  Recognize that certain things you take literally might potentially be part of some sort of metaphor or cultural reference which would be obvious to original readers but easily missed by modern ones.  This method is called &quot;Higher criticism&quot; [1].  (Sometimes what &quot;makes us look dumb&quot; is reading ancient books without any historical insight, and expecting to understand them perfectly.)<p>In this specific case, you&#x27;ll find something simple and enlightening: the Genesis creation account is a monotheistic response to the polytheistic Egyptian creation account [2].  It uses essentially the same style of storytelling and language of creation as the older Egyptian accounts, referring to many of the same types of events, but <i>in ways that are insulting to the Egyptian pantheon</i>.  Ancient readers would not have necessarily viewed it as giving a timeline for creation, but rather as describing the relation of objects they could see to the divine.  The Egyptian account describes some objects as divine (like the sun, moon, and certain bodies of water); the Genesis account describes the same objects as physical objects created by an unseen divine being (the sun and moon aren&#x27;t even <i>named</i>; they&#x27;re referred to as mere &quot;lights&quot;.)  The Egyptian account refers to gods of specific realms like day, night, and water; the Genesis account establishes a single God with power simultaneously in all realms.  It should not be surprising that the first pages of the central text of a major monotheistic religion would be about there being <i>One God</i> rather than about how long the creation process was.<p>By the way, this is not at all a new viewpoint.  I&#x27;ve seen it expressed by 2nd and 3rd century Christian scholars like Irenaeus and Origen [3].<p>---<p>[0] Christian Fundamentalism was founded around the start of WWI.

And who is found so ignorant as to suppose that God, as if He had been a husbandman, planted trees in paradise, in Eden towards the east, and a tree of life in it, i.e., a visible and palpable tree of wood, so that anyone eating of it with bodily teeth should obtain life, and, eating again of another tree, should come to the knowledge of good and evil?  No one, I think, can doubt that the statement that God walked in the afternoon in paradise, and that Adam lay hid under a tree, is related figuratively in Scripture, that some mystical meaning may be indicated by it.&quot; - <a href=""http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.v.i.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf04.vi.v.v.i.html</a> section 16",1409374249

8245682,comment,8244930,8245580,7,0,bane,,,"I think it&#x27;s going to start becoming reasonable to package up applications in VMs and distributing the VMs &quot;appliances&quot; to run instead of installing software directly in the OS. I think this is going to start happening regularly in the consumer space sooner rather than later (and already has in some cases like with XP Mode). This is pretty much modus operandi in the service space today.<p>There&#x27;s lots of really good reasons to do this (sandboxing, ease of installation, compatibility, snapshots/state saving, etc.) and VM tech at the consumer level is good enough for most applications. Doing so also enables you to distribute the same application for different host architectures relatively easily (swap out the virtualization core with an emulation core).<p>VM technology basically will allow consumer software vendors to start treating your computer like a set-spec videogame console instead of worrying about millions or billions of possible complications from how your computer is set up. Once VMs in the consumer space get good enough to really run high-end games, imagine everybody just writes to some Valve defined Linux spec that just happens to match some Steam Box, but you can install the VM for that game on your Mac or Windows or whatever and get to gaming.<p>If this happens, VMs will chew through RAM faster than just about anything out there.<p>So instead of installing and running Adobe Suite, you start up the Adobe Suite VM and boom, 8GB of your RAM vaporizes. Fire up your web browser VM and boom, there goes another 4GB. Your e-mail client annihilates 4GB more and now we&#x27;ve eaten up 16GB of RAM to run a handful of applications. Open up an MS-Office component and there goes another 8-16GB. Run a non-virtualized legacy app? Why those all just get sandboxed into an automatic &quot;old shit&quot; VM so the virii keep out.<p>This isn&#x27;t inconceivable and I wouldn&#x27;t be at all surprised if this wasn&#x27;t already on the drawing boards somewhere.",1409374047

8245646,comment,8245373,8245611,7,0,scythe,,,"Sativa is probably the better strain for pain relief, as it contains primarily THC (which is analgesic), whereas indicas contain roughly equal amounts of THC and CBD (which is anxiolytic and sedative).<p>A lot has been said in this debate and a sort of misguided idea that has been floating around lately is that the therapeutic effects of cannabis are entirely due to CBD, but this is <i>not</i> the case. Current thinking is that the cannabinoid receptor type 1 -- CB1 -- is responsible for analgesic (anti-pain) and recreational properties, while CB2 is responsible for antiinflammatory effects; these are both targeted by THC, not CBD. CBD binds to a novel binding site GPR55 (iirc) and to 5-ht1a, which is believed to be partially responsible for the prosocial effects of MDMA, but not to cannabinoid receptors. Wrt. cancer, a bad summary is that THC activates some parts of the body&#x27;s natural cancer defenses via CB2 (all CB2 agonists do so) and CBD might have some strange, mechanism-not-yet-determine antiproliferative activity. However, these effects may be too modest to be practically useful (who knows?); cancers easily become resistant to CB2 agonists.<p>While I&#x27;m blabbering I might as well dispense with the idea propounded by some that cannabis should only be used medically in the form of precisely calibrated extract compositions: this idea, while attractive, is simply too expensive, and unfair to poor people seeking pain relief, somnolescence, etc. However, from what I&#x27;ve seen here today, it might not be bad to try to implement a system where doctors can prescribe a specific terpenoid ratio w.r.t. THC, CBD, and THCV; the last is an antagonist and may give strains a &quot;ceiling&quot; effect, which can be useful if people need to smoke all day for some reason.",1409372839

It was probably related to OS updates/changes being applied over time, resulting in a configuration that changes. I&#x27;ve always found it good practice to build and maintain a staging environment that mimics the production environment in all aspects. When configuration changes (aka security patch) are needed, they are tested and validated on the staging environment before they are deployed on the production environment. This gives you an opportunity to test and validate the results in a non-production (aka no rules, no SLA&#x27;s) environment. Part of this involves validating that procedures such as DR will continue to work as expected on the new configuration, before it gets rolled out to production. From my experience, this methodology minimizes scenarios of unexpected behavior in the production environment (aka downtime).

Rather than legislate based on the merit of both opinions (eg. paid vs free tax filing), companies are introducing often personal financial incentives for politicians to dig their heels into the ground by claiming that a particular opinion is Right and True.
