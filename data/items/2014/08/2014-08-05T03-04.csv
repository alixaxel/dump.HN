These folks aren&#x27;t as backwards as you think, they already have a development workflow that works just fine. They push their stuff to their htdocs folder (via FTPS) and it just works. We even support WebDeploy (also secure) on the Windows platform so they can build MS deploy packages and push them up.<p>Most of our clients do use source control, they&#x27;re not that naive but not all of them have drank the Github Koolade. They&#x27;re happy with their own private source control arrangements.<p>It&#x27;s an environment and process that&#x27;s tried and tested so they can get on with building apps that pay the rent and keep the lights on without futzing about with dynos and droplets and the like. Not only that they can pick up the phone and within two rings get access to an experience frontline engineer who will fix a problem or answer a question within a couple of hours.<p>I can speak about this from experience as an engineer who works for a UK shared hoster. Admittedly we&#x27;re not a bulk shared-hoster like GoDaddy, our services are tailored towards the needs of business clients, not someone&#x27;s granny deploying a Wordpress site with pictures of cats.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#FTPS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol#FTPS</a>",1407211075

You get more when you successfully introduce someone who is useful to your higher-status contact,<p>The odd thing is, even in an unsuccessful match, where you introduce two people and they don&#x27;t establish a relationship they both find pleasant,  if you connect a lower-status contact with the higher-status contact, even if the match is unsuccessful, you are still seen to have done your lower-status contact a favor, even though you have annoyed the higher status contact, so if the lower-status contact is someone you want to curry favor with, it might make sense to introduce them even if there is a lower probability of them forming a mutually profitable relationship with the higher-status contact, but normally it&#x27;s a matter of &quot;how interesting is the potential relationship between the two people I am introducing,&quot; which takes some thought and often times means not making the introduction.<p>The upshot here is that I&#x27;m not going to just right out introduce two of my contacts.

To make the GP statement true, you have to adopt sweepingly wide definitions of the terms &quot;parametric&quot; and &quot;density estimation&quot;, and a very narrow concept of ML to boot.  You have given some good background and I feel a need to add more examples.<p>The idea of boosting comes to mind. A quintessential ML concept, widely applicable, but really nothing to do with density estimation.<p>All the PAC learning results are another example.  They show very strong results over very wide problem classes, but don&#x27;t have to do with density estimation.  They apply, for example, to problems where no density exists (just a probability measure),  much less a smooth-enough density to estimate.<p>Another example of ML research that comes to mind is time and space efficient learning.  There is a whole body of work on probabilistic analysis of data structures used for ML (I&#x27;m thinking partly about Alex Gray&#x27;s work, <a href=""http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~agray/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~agray/</a>).

Otherwise the discussion is moot, if you use too broad definitions thens &quot;everything is parametric&quot; becomes a tautology, a vacuous statement.<p>PAC and MDL arent as much as at odds that you make it up to be. If you are familiar with PAC-Bayes and PAC-MDL theorems you will know what I mean. My main issue was with the ridiculous (or with your definition of whats &#x27;parametric&#x27; then a vapid) claim that all of ML is parametric.<p>Secondly, wanted to highlight that its a bad way to go about ML, by estimating data distribution first and then find the decision function. This is the precise reason why SVMs broke out of the then state of the art. The two stage &#x27;plug-in&#x27; approach used to be the preferred way then. A decision function might be Bayes with respect to some density, but thats besides the point, it is ill advised to match the density and then derive the decision function, except for very special and narrow cases.<p>Even if you throw PAC out, parametric stats (am using the standard definition here) is a tool with very narrow scope. If it happens to be in the current scope then by all means use it.<p>BTW you make good point about transductive learning, it got compared to semisupervised, but they are not the same thing. Both use unlabeled data, but for transductive, the points were you seek labels have to be given ahead of time. This enables very strong guarantees. I think its potential has not come to fruition yet.<p>EDIT:\n@murbard2 > Re: See what I did there.<p>Color me violently unimpressed. That is a not a parametric distribution.<p>I continue to stress that plugin estimates are in general not a good idea. Even die-hard Bayesians would not use it, they would rather estimate the MAP or the mean aposteriori decision function directly, rather than fit data distribution and then derive the optimal decision function from it.<p>I find Bayesian inference to be a good idea, except that it is costly unless you use conjugate priors (these are motivated more by convenience than by data) and its &quot;turtles all the way down&quot; problem.<p>Its not that you have advocated plug in estimators, but given your claim about everything about ML is about fitting parametric densities, it is likely to mislead readers into believing that the two step way is a good idea.",1407210028

8135381,comment,8133808,8135242,9,0,lchengify,,,"I was shocked to hear this so I did some research.  As it turns out, it has a lot to do with foreign subsidies, similar to solar power.<p>Apparently up until 1981, the US had the Construction differential subsidy program [1][2] that subsided shipbuilding construction.  During the Regan administration, the US eliminated subsidies whereas countries in Asia did not.  Now the top 10 shipbuilding countries are in China, Korea, or Japan [3][4].<p>Outside of a few exceptions, such as a 1920 law forcing US-based natural gas to only be transported on American made/manned ships [5], the US shipbuilding industry has one customer: the military.  Without additional subsidies it&#x27;s unlikely the US can effectively compete with places like China, which continue to increase subsidies for shipbuilders [6].<p>In this political climate (especially post-Solyndra, post ethanol-subsidy) I think it&#x27;s unlikely the federal government would increase subsidies for a private industry.  On one hand, this might not be a bad thing: Chinese-subsidized industries don&#x27;t always work out the way they planned (e.g., the construction of ghost towns).  However if the military doesn&#x27;t keep the industry up-to-date technologically, a shipbuilding tech gap could form, which might impact national security.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Shipbuilding_Program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Shipbuilding_Program</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.marinelink.com/article/shipbuilding/the-future-american-shipbuilding-805"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marinelink.com/article/shipbuilding/the-future-am...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.marineinsight.com/marine/marine-news/headline/top-10-shipbuilding-companies-in-the-world-in-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.marineinsight.com/marine/marine-news/headline/top...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://thediplomat.com/2012/11/u-s-navy-take-notice-china-is-becoming-a-world-class-military-shipbuilder/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thediplomat.com/2012/11/u-s-navy-take-notice-china-is...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/09/20/boom-in-natural-gas-production-sends-us-shipyards-into-overdrive/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/09/20/boom-in-natural-gas-pro...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/09/us-china-shipping-idUSBRE9B80Q320131209"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/09/us-china-shipping-...</a>",1407209722

Some people do survive Ebola (aka the plague or the black plague). But not many. Ebola spreads, and fast at that, in areas where there are high population densities, areas where people are in close contact (areas like NYC). Because of the symptoms, it is possible that someone may be infected, spreading the disease, but think they have the flu or some other common ailment. That is the reason why the hospital in the original article didn&#x27;t take chances and put the person in involuntary quarantine (the article didn&#x27;t say it but I can guarantee that is the case (and the patient may not know it because if you had Ebola you would have to be insane to decline care)).

A 50+% pay raise to move to SF or SV looks nice until you really start to work the numbers and realize that you would actually come out worse off in many ways.<p>* A mortgage on a 3,500 square foot house, on a 1/3 acre lot in a very nice neighborhood runs me a hair over $1,200 a month. Including taxes and insurance. Everything except the HOA, and that&#x27;s an extra $30 or so a month.<p>* I live in a nice family-oriented area with great schools. Don&#x27;t have to worry about gang violence or anything. My biggest annoyance is the teen with the loud scooter.<p>* Utilities are dirt cheap thanks to TVA.<p>* Property taxes are dirt cheap. Income taxes are on the low side. Sales tax is a tad on the high side, but it&#x27;s not bad.<p>* I have a 15 minute commute to and from the office every day, maybe 20 on a bad day. I&#x27;m home every night for dinner with my family.<p>And while Huntsville won&#x27;t win any awards for high culture (although there is actually a surprisingly vibrant arts scene here considering its size, not really what I was expecting to find), Nashville and Birmingham are only 90 minutes away in either direction - great for a day trip. Atlanta or Memphis are weekend trips of a few hours away. And I can be on great beaches in a few hours as well.<p>With my extra income, I can afford to save and do fun things. After our daughter was born, we needed a larger car, so we bought one and paid cash for it. We go skiing in West Virginia during the holidays. We did two weeks in Hawaii for our honeymoon, a week in London a few years and a week in Jamaica a couple years ago. Just because we wanted to. We&#x27;re currently planning to go all out and go to Tahiti in a few years to celebrate our 10th. Also saving for the inevitable trip to Disney World once our daughter is old enough. A lot of this is possible because my cost of living here is so low that it allows me a large amount of discretionary income.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s not without its problems. We have a real problem with severe weather here in the Spring, and it can be kind of rough sometimes (fun fact, Alabama has had more F-5/EF-5 tornadoes than any other state). Our politicians are really idiotic and can be counted on to say very, very stupid things. We have some pretty backwards laws. And, unfortunately, there is some level of truth to the stereotypes people have of Alabama (although they are pretty uncommon here in Huntsville - it&#x27;s more of a rural thing), but it&#x27;s also nowhere near the level people think it is either.<p>But, on the whole, every time I go to look at the tradeoffs, the math always works for me to stay put here. No one has yet shown me that I can live the equivalent lifestyle in SF or SV that I live here on an average developer&#x27;s salary.",1407209085

Its not the appleism thing because that was always there, ever since they made that android fork that emulates a lot of iOS UX.<p>No, the company seems to be at a crossroads: other firms like Oppo have overtaken it in breaking into the international market, which is ironic since xiaomi was the first chinese electronic firm anyone outside China cared about. At the same time they keep delaying a proper international rollout while trying to compete in the cutthroat bargain phone market in Asia were you have literally hundreds of brands making all kinds of stuff at incredible prices and very thin profits.<p>In short, its trying to be premium and affordable at the same time, and differentiate from regular android while still being android because it lacks the capacity to develop and support its own OS.<p>I don&#x27;t care about how they copy apple because lets be honest everybody does, even apple copies other companies, because you have to be a stubborn idiot to miss a business opportunity for the sake of originality. If you that you go broke, and businesses are constantly doing and imitating whatever is successful. Does a dubstep BGM in an ad help sales? then we are using dubstep, end of story.",1407208216

8135323,comment,8133835,8133835,12,0,zoomerang,,,"The problem with raw SQL queries is that they don&#x27;t compose. Using an ORM, I can do two things.<p>1. Pass around query objects, and build queries derived from others. I can also combine multiple queries into one and split the results.<p>2. Update model records in multiple places passing them through several layers of business logic before serializing.<p>This is on top of the other obvious benefits of ORMs, such as abstraction over my storage engine. I can write a single &#x27;query&#x27; that be be executed against a variety of SQL servers, Salesforce, MonoDB, an in-memory cache, or whatever else I want to do with it.<p>As a real-world example of why this matters - On my current project, I have a heuristic algorithm that allocates pending jobs to workers that meet the required skillset. As part of this, I have individually defined rules that must be met. As part of the operation, each rule can query the database for relevant results.<p>Each rule is a standalone module, and by design cannot have any knowledge of other rules. Rules can be written by third parties and are plugged in and loaded at runtime. To make this work, we can either<p>1. Run one query per rule, hitting the database more than needed\n2. Compose all the rules into one query, hitting the database once.<p>Using an ORM, I&#x27;m able to take a base query and fold it through all the available rules, allowing each one to return an updated query to be merged. Some rules conflict - they may require results that another rule has filtered out. To solve this, the ORM will automatically detect the conflict and build a single &#x27;Query&#x27; object that compiles to a broader query behind the scenes, takes the results, stores them in an in-memory cache, and then runs the individual rules in-memory against them to get a final resultset. In the worst case scenario where this is not possible, it will compile to the minimum possible number of SQL queries to satisfy all of the individual callers.<p>As a result, each rule can run a different query against the database, getting the individual resultset it wanted, while not hitting the database so heavily.<p>Why not just query multiple times? In this case, we&#x27;re running this against a Salesforce database. On top of the fact that you pay per API call, there&#x27;s anywhere up to 2 seconds of latency before getting a result. Composing the queries means we take an operation that might have taken a few minutes and used a lot of expensive API calls into an operation that takes a few seconds and uses 1 API call.<p>At the end of this I get a resulting immutable object. I can perform business logic on this in multiple places, accumulating changes,  at the end of which I have an `update` object containing an original version and a delta. I can then just update the things that actually need updating, and can run additional business rules intelligently based on which fields were changed. If there are multiple records that need updating, the ORM will batch them for me to further reduce API calls.<p>Using raw SQL, it would be possible to implement a rough hack that approximates this, but it would be nowhere near as efficient or scalable.",1407207876
