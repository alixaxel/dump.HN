8196715,comment,8195918,8196149,6,0,reasonattlm,,,"Seneca: &quot;Death: There&#x27;s nothing bad about it at all except the thing that comes before it - the fear of it.&quot;<p>Insofar as death is oblivion, the destruction of the self, it is rational to be unconcerned about being dead. You won&#x27;t exist to have feelings on the matter - which is exactly the same situation as for all time prior to the point in your development at which you like to think that you became yourself.<p>Equally, it is rational to be very concerned about being dead at some point in the future. Humans are creatures of action. We like to achieve, observe, and experience. We place value upon these things, and death will stop us from gathering that value.<p>So the world of people might be divided at any point in time into (a) the group that is horrified by the prospect of oblivion, and (b) the group that is unbothered by personal extinction. It&#x27;s a very sharp dividing line, not often explored in casual conversation, for all that one person&#x27;s views might cross back and forth between camps over the years. Try a poll of the folk you know at some point in time: I think you&#x27;ll find the results interesting.<p>Whatever your opinions on oblivion, however, it seems near universally agreed that the process of becoming dead is something to be feared - so much so that we work to hide the ugly reality from daily life, we put it from our mind, and we even rise up in anger to confront those trying to do something about it by fighting aging through the development of new medicine.<p>Terrible pain, injury, and degeneration are not on anyone&#x27;s wish list. But we&#x27;ll all be receiving these dubious gifts anyway - unless something is done about it. The difference between our age and the age of the Greek stoics is that we have the chance to do something about it: defeat aging by repairing its damage, improve our biochemistry, and ultimately replace our bodies with superior technology that is immune to all that plagues us now.",1408445958

It was an unmitigated disaster although the PR for the event says otherwise.<p>Typically a lot of the ActiveX vendors that were relied on to prop up the browser functionality that had previously been migrated from IE5/Win2000 are gone. There is no source code so the only result is to hire in contractors to rewrite/replace functionality from scratch as a winforms app (as browsers still can&#x27;t do this sort of stuff, Silverlight is canned and the contractors don&#x27;t know WPF). This is not a bad thing but it has a cost.<p>Add to that, the server side, a completely insecure hodge-podge of ASP that only worked on Windows 2003 and VB6 COM components. This needed scrapping and starting again. Typically they did this with contractors who just about knew ASP.Net web forms, some WCF and a bit of SQL so we&#x27;re talking circa 2005-2008 tech for the rewrite.<p>Then there&#x27;s the hardware which had 10baseT networks so the entire core switches were replaced, all the cabling was replaced and the workstations were all replaced, 25 servers were replaced, the network appliances were replaced and a SAN was added.<p>Ten years down the line, a rewrite will be due and it will require porting to Windows X (10) and all the tech will have changed again.<p>So £15.5m every decade for this platform + maintenance on top.<p>That&#x27;s a lot of bottom line out of the window for a tech choice. At least with other platforms, incremental change is a hell of a lot easier and cheaper (Java EE / generic Unix).",1408445650

8196698,comment,8193754,8194776,3,0,antimagic,,,"Weeellll, your position is defensible if you&#x27;re writing an application.  If you&#x27;re writing a library though, let me just let you know that every time I encounter a package with a C++ API, I want to drive stakes into the author&#x27;s eyes, as compensation for the pain <i>I&#x27;m</i> about to experience.<p>Like it or not, C is the lingua franca of the programming world.  Pretty much every other language out there provides C bindings, not C++ bindings.  Which means that when your function exports something wonderful like smart pointers, <i>my</i> world just becomes painful.<p>Furthermore, in embedded environments, it can be challenging (to use a euphemism) to get source code debugging up and running.  If your code is written in C, it&#x27;s not so bad, non-optimised machine code generated from C tends to match the actual C code fairly closely, to the point that you can very nearly read it as easily as the original source.  This is not true for C++, which means that every time something goes wrong in C++ code, I&#x27;m probably going to lose a week of my life inserting trace into the code, compiling, deploying to target, and running the test, ad infinitum. Not fun.<p>Even in the case where you&#x27;re writing an application, I&#x27;m personally dubious about the benefits of C++.  Write the application in a higher-level language, personally I like Javascript (JavaScriptCore) for this, but I&#x27;ve had good success with Ruby and lua as well.  When you hit a performance bottleneck, push the performance sensitive code into C, and create bindings.  As a bonus, your C code is now easily available to be used as a library from any other language, without inducing homicidal tendencies in the user.",1408445245

Even if Google sticks with Java-only, I would very much hope they will offer a more immutability-friendly API in parallel with the existing one.<p>Certain Scala libraries are indeed not accessible. But the trend is in the right direction (there are better alternatives to requests now, and even scalaz has become less symbolic in recent releases). If Google were to provide the same APIs and sample programs that they currently do, those programs would be as accessible as they currently are - probably more so, given Scala&#x27;s cleaner syntax. You say this could make Android less accessible. Maybe. But it could also make Scala more accessible, providing a whole new class of developers with a stepping-stone from somewhere very familiar towards these valuable high-level features.<p>As the Python folks say, a good language should make easy things easy and hard things possible. IMO Scala does both halves better than Java. It&#x27;s just that so far, people have mostly been using it for hard things.",1408444958

The idea is to have them somewhere harmless rather in us. Leaded fuel was a bit of a disaster from that point of view hence the decline in the graph as leaded fuel was banned. (Still available in Algeria, Iraq, Yemen, Myanmar, North Korea according to Wikipedia). I think the solar panels could be done without net lead ending up in people if handled properly. Incidentally there&#x27;s a probably a fair bit of lead a few mm from you in the solder of your electronic gadget but it doesn&#x27;t do any harm there as it&#x27;s had to get it from solder in to people. Hopefully the panels would have similar stability and not be like lead based paints which are a problem.<p>There are some similar question marks with cadmium based solar panels of which First Solar have installed 8GW worth. I think I might worry slightly about those too, probably more that lead. Indeed I think First Solar have only done industrial installations for power companies rather than domestic so the recycling can be done properly.",1408443585
8196641,comment,8195791,8195791,7,0,gjm11,,,"To rephrase the story a little: Instead of making solar panels out of silicon, with 20-25% efficiency, we could make them out of perovskite, which contains lead and yields a little below 20% efficiency. Because then we could reuse lead from car batteries instead of putting them in landfill.<p>It seems to me that by the time the car batteries are in the recycling system, ready for use to make perovskite solar panels, the lead-pollution problem is already solved. So then the question is: You have a stash of car batteries that you can reuse if you want to. Do you want to make solar panels out of silicon or out of perovskite?<p>It looks to me as if the answer is clearly &quot;silicon&quot;. Can it really be harder to dispose of the lead batteries safely than it is to make perovskite solar panels out of them?<p>It had better not be, given that the amount of lead needed by one solar panel installation is about 1/30 the amount in one car battery. There are a <i>lot</i> more car batteries made per year than 1/30 the number of solar panel installations.",1408443584

8196631,comment,8196316,8196546,2,0,lucb1e,,,"Hmm, I never liked those books on subjects like operating systems or programming languages or something. Tried a few times, but they generally have a low information density (telling it in the typical book-like fashion) and go into details that you don&#x27;t need or remember. I usually learn by googling or asking others when I don&#x27;t know what to google.<p>Perhaps a short introduction might have been useful, but it depends on the person what you want to use and thus what you should be taught first. I&#x27;d be bored if it introduced me to things like the difference between /dev/random and /dev/urandom when I didn&#x27;t even know what executable permissions were. Fun fact: last semester we got Linux lessons in school and this (u)random difference is one of the things they taught (alongside the basics like rm and grep usage).
