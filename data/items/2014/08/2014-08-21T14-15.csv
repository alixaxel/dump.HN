And one of the arguments against such plans is that getting all the polluters on-board is rather impractical. Such cooperation is pretty much unprecedented, with the only example I can think of being the treaty on emissions of CFCs.<p>If even that one example - of something that is, in comparison to the burning of fossil fuels, barely a drop in the bucket - then it doesn&#x27;t bode well for humanity&#x27;s ability to get a handle on CO2 emissions.",1408633193

8207623,comment,8206793,8206793,2,0,graycat,,,"So, we&#x27;re all supposed to be all concerned about CFCs and ozone, again.  Hmm ....<p>Sorry, guys.  Net, I just can&#x27;t accept the <i>null hypothesis</i> and have to reject it.  I know; I know; a guy got the Nobel prize in chemistry for his work on CFCs and ozone.  Nice.  Sounds like really good work in chemistry.<p>So, the <i>null hypothesis</i> is that we must restrict CFCs or we will be <i>destroying the planet</i>, the sky will fall, we will all get skin cancer, in the tropics all life will be destroyed, the ozone layer is the blanket protecting life on our Mother Earth, and we will be destroying it!  Evil humans!  Evil CFCs!  Precious life giving ozone!  So go the cries.<p>Sorry, guys, I have to reject that <i>null hypothesis</i>.<p>Why reject?  It smells like week old dead fish, that&#x27;s why.<p>Or, it&#x27;s the old trilogy:  Transgression by sinful, evil humans (using CFCs).  Retribution from an angry god (skin cancer).  Redemption via sacrifice (destroy old A/C equipment).<p>Old?  Sure, back to the old English morality plays.  In various versions, for centuries in Europe it had the Roman Catholic church filthy rich.  How rich?  Look up the Bishop&#x27;s Residenz in Würzburg (1751-53).  To heck with some dirt cheap, $100 million Manhattan apartment; for some real luxury, tough to beat the Bishop&#x27;s Residenz!  Or, at one time, the Roman Catholic church owned a major fraction of all the farm land in France which happens to have a major fraction of all the good farm land in Europe.  Did I mention <i>rich</i>?<p>Such a good wheel had to be reinvented:  Okay, the Mayan charlatans claimed that they had to kill people (sacrifice) to pour their blood on a rock to keep the sun moving across the sky (redemption).  Ah, right, the trilogy from Europe was more sophisticated!<p>Okay, guys:  It&#x27;s a scam.  Old England figured it out with the morality plays.  The Europeans figured it out with the Roman Catholic church.  The Mayans figured it out with pouring blood on a rock.  It&#x27;s a popular scam, reinvented more than once.  Don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s not a scam.<p>Instead, as usual, there&#x27;s a <i>hidden agenda</i>.  Or, wise advice, &quot;Always look for the hidden agenda.&quot;.  Yup, good advice.<p>Here for CFCs, what is the hidden agenda?  Sure:  Outlaw old Freon, which was getting to be a cheap commodity; sell new refrigeration working fluids at much higher prices; and destroy all existing auto A/C and more refrigeration equipment.  Yup, I&#x27;ve got two cars with A/C that doesn&#x27;t work due to lack of Freon.<p>So, net, what is the really believable real reason for the laws against CFCs?  Sure:  Sell more working fluid and equipment for refrigeration, especially auto A/C.<p>That the real reason is protecting the ozone layer?  Smells like week old dead fish to me.  Selling more A/C sounds much more believable.<p>Or, take the other wise advice, &quot;Follow the money.&quot;.  Still, I&#x27;m sure it was some really nice chemistry.<p>For NASA talking about this now?  Hmm ....  The White House likes to have the Administration talking about <i>green</i> things.  Doing things?  Not so much.  Talking?  Yup, lots of it.  Why?  Get political support from the <i>greenies</i>.  Easy political support -- just have, say, NASA issue some press releases and get some support.  Nothing real, just some simple politics.<p>Do I believe that the NASA statement is really about the ozone or about White House politics?  I come down on the side of White House politics; I&#x27;m sure that the White House cares much more about politics than ozone.<p>Sorry &#x27;bout that, but as a citizen I have to form opinions, and eventually I can smell week old dead fish and do believe in the importance of hidden agendas, following the money, and watching out for politics, all much more than ozone.<p>Fool me once; shame on you.  Fool me twice; shame on me.  I&#x27;ve been fooled more than once already and don&#x27;t want to be fooled again.  By now I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s really about the ozone; not a chance.  If NASA and the White House have some really good evidence, then they can trot it out.  Else I will just move on.<p>Now, has rational, engineering, scientific, skeptical <i>Hacker News</i> been converted into naive, sucker, gullible, <i>politically correct,</i>, brain-dead, anxiety-ridden. manipulated <i>greenie</i> news and propaganda?

Both parent jobs need to be located relatively close by.<p>#2 typically take a huge chunk out of the 2nd income (which is almost always unfairly compared against the mother&#x27;s income), at least until a family can survive/pay for such child-care until public schooling becomes an option.<p>#3 is only really an option for those that earn enough to support a full or part-time babysitter.<p>Sometimes you&#x27;ll see a combination of #2 and #3, but that again is only really an option for those with enough cash-flow. Some preschool programs are even more expensive than a decent nanny, although ones loses out on the socialization aspects that come built-in with a daycare program.<p>Home life (beyond kids) for dual-income households is a shared responsibility. I don&#x27;t think much changes there whether you&#x27;re a single income or dual-income household. If you&#x27;re talking about chores like groceries, cooking dinner and cleaning up, that&#x27;s what weekends and evenings are for.<p>In real terms, we may be earning half as much (or even less depending on the combined income), but the marginal incremental value of the career experience and/or additional dollars is usually enough that going dual-income wins out.<p>EDIT: @humanrebar mentioned the &quot;safety premium&quot;.

In SF, they both earn about 110k a year.  So $220k is a high salary, comparable to a physician in a modestly paying speciality.<p>Here&#x27;s the thing...  <i>I think</i> payroll deductions apply to the entire 110K of each dh and nurse&#x27;s salary, but only the first $110k of the physicians salary.  However, the second salary in the two-income family will be taxed at a high rate, on top of the first salary.  Furthermore, physician&#x27;s husband, who doesn&#x27;t work, is available for full time child care.  The nurse and dental hygienist have to arrange full time day care for their two young kids, which runs about $20-25,000k a year per kid in SF.  And because they are a <i>very</i> high income family, over the &quot;ultra-rich&quot; 200k threshold, they don&#x27;t get a tax break.<p>Even close to 100k, that second salary may have a marginal value close to zero once kids enter the picture.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean you shouldn&#x27;t work just because the marginal value is low in the moment - eventually you get to come back up for air, and people who continued to work are often much better positioned to advance again.

Now we are, and there&#x27;s a push for everyone to change their tactics. I think it&#x27;s fair that everyone has to change, but I acknowledge that it&#x27;s a bit unfair that the west got to profit on those mistakes. But that&#x27;s just life.<p>Developing nations now have real solid data on the environmental damage an industrial revolution will inflict not only on their part of the world, but the world as a whole. Is it fair to ask them to factor that new knowledge into their plans? Maybe it&#x27;s not exactly fair, but it&#x27;s a reasonable request I think.<p>But then what about a child born today? Is it fair for that child to grow up in a world where the air they will breath becomes more dangerous with each passing second, even though the adults of today know what they are doing and have it in their power to not do it? I think that&#x27;s unfair.<p>And it&#x27;s not like China&#x27;s industrialisation has helped all Chinese. It&#x27;s helped a few people. Is it fair that all citizens of Shanghai should suffer the health effects of the pollution generated as a result of 1 persons endeavour to maximise a profit?

8207487,comment,8206038,8207042,7,0,progman,,,"> OTOH modern &quot;researchey&quot; languages, like Coq or even Haskell, are far far ahead of Lisp.<p>I know Common Lisp well, and I honestly tried to learn and to use Haskell. I realized that Haskell has the advantage of a strong type system but it seems only to be useful for language research (compiler writing) and mathematical applications. Haskell is (in my case) almost useless for every day real world applications. It is a very good choice if I know the algorithm and data structures exactly in advance. But real world applications often require changes which are not predictable. It is a pain to align a whole Haskell project according to new requirements to make the whole system work again. It takes far too much time, and I wonder where the benefits are if other weaker typed languages can do the same job as well, or even better.<p>In the Lisp world I can develop prototypes very quickly. And if I need a strong type system as in Haskell then I can use Shen (shenlanguage.org) which has a strong rule based type system on top of Lisp. That means that I can use both worlds -- the default dynamic system of Lisp, and the strong type system of Shen.<p>Lisp is still very powerful and yet small in comparison to the huge LLVM system of Haskell. It can be used on embedded systems (ECL for instance) which Haskell is not able to do (AFAIK).<p>I don&#x27;t know what you exactly mean with &quot;tracking&quot;. If that means tracing then Lisp even offers backtracking (debugging back in time), and I think almost every Lisp programmer knows Slime.<p>So the claim that Haskell is &quot;far far ahead&quot; of Lisp is not true at all. The only real weak point of Lisp is a good GUI library. I wish there were strong support of Qt and HTML5.<p>Another favorite language of me is Nimrod because it joins the best of several languages (Python, Perl, Lisp and C) together.",1408631154

Crazy Austrian folks call the increase in the supply of money &quot;inflation&quot; but that&#x27;s not what most people think of when you say the word.  The vast majority of people would agree that &quot;inflation&quot; and &quot;the CPI&quot; are basically the same thing.  The CPI is the Consumer Price Index.  It is a measure of the cost of living as set forth by the BLS here in the US.<p>So what you just said is that the cost of living is going up faster than the cost of living!  That clearly can&#x27;t be true, so there&#x27;s a problem.  The actual cost of living is going up faster than the government&#x27;s measure of it.  Okay, that&#x27;s better.  But it&#x27;s still problematic.<p>If the government&#x27;s measure of the cost of living is going up slower than the actual cost of living then a lot of people are getting screwed.  Anyone on a fixed income that&#x27;s inflation adjusted like Social Security or a pension.  Anyone buying a TIPS bond, anyone who gets regular cost-of-living raises so that their salary keeps up with their expenses, etc.<p>If the CPI number was accurate then all these things would be OK.  But since it seems like it&#x27;s not the fact that huge swaths of socioeconomic activity is tied to these indicators is really pretty tragic.<p>I think Carl Sagan captured the essence of why these kinds of things take forever to get found out:<p>&quot;One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If we’ve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. We’re no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. It’s simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that we’ve been taken.

If the VM could send key combinations to the UI of the VMC then the software running on the VM could determine if it was in a &quot;honeypot&quot; (VM) with or without this easter-egg (e.g. send CTRL-ALT-INSERT and see if CTRL-ALT-DELETE is triggered within the VM&#x27;s context, restart the VM, alter connected devices, and so on).<p>Also, yes, I think Easter Eggs are fine in a VMC. Particularly when they&#x27;re only UI deep as is this case. The only software I wouldn&#x27;t put easter eggs into is software which is &quot;life-death critical&quot; (aircraft control systems, industrial equipment, et al). But these kind of systems are sometimes designed to be mathematically proven safe with no possible conflating variables in the execution (so putting in easter eggs would be HUGELY expensive and likely wouldn&#x27;t happen for that reason).",1408630852

My anecdotal observation is that townhomes in major cities are affordable to single folks with one (low six figure) income and single family homes require two such incomes. And that actually does make a bit of sense, as a married couple has a higher probability of making good use of a SFH than a single person does.<p>I don&#x27;t predict a crash (at least not based on this phenomenon alone) precisely due to the abundance of townhomes that are being built in the US. In Houston, for instance, even though the townhomes are sort of hated since they&#x27;re replacing old, historic bungalows in many cases, they are the one thing keeping the city somewhat affordable.

If people spend their extra income on leisure activities, luxury goods, etc then it&#x27;ll absolutely mean that a high household income will be a good measure of richness. That&#x27;s obvious.<p>However, if dual income households decide to spend their income on investing in a better house, what will happen is that it&#x27;ll push house prices up - a finite supply of housing stock means there&#x27;ll be competition for the best homes, so people will have to pay more for them. That demand side pressure will filter down the housing ladder and pull all the prices up. After thirty or forty years this will have had the effect on house prices that single income families just can&#x27;t afford to buy. Further, it&#x27;ll mean that dual income families <i>have</i> to retain two incomes, so parents wanting to stay at home when they have children simply won&#x27;t be able to afford to.<p>This has already happened in the UK. Lots of pundits are predicting a crash because the first-time buyers can&#x27;t afford to buy, meaning no one is buying the lower price houses, and that&#x27;s going to pull the whole thing down.<p>Mind you, the pundits have been saying as much for about twenty years.",1408630095
