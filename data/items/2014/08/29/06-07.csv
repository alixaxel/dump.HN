8241411,comment,8238869,8240640,6,0,possibilistic,,,"Biological abstraction is simply <i>not a thing</i>. You must understand that the fundamental difference between digital logic, software, etc. and biological systems, reaction mechanisms, signaling, and the like is not simply about sorting out how the different things are connected together. The biggest differentiating factor is by far is how deeply fundamental high-order nonlinear dynamics and complexity are within biological systems. The topology is an implementation detail and isn&#x27;t want causes us problems.<p>Consider the nature of digital logic for algorithms of a low computational complexity. There might be a simple state machine, some kind of input, and one or more terminal states. Let&#x27;s reduce this even further to the level of logic gates. NOT, AND, OR, and all the like are extremely simple and trivial to calculate. As far as the physical implementation of these goes, I have to admit that my knowledge of EE is fairly poor. I know there are some rather involved mathematics. AFAIK, however, the ultimate determinate of &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; state is a thresholding function. It&#x27;s really not that bad of a problem.<p>Now let&#x27;s consider one of the lowest possible levels of what we would consider to be a biochemical system: two chemicals involved in a reaction. For our sake, we would probably make it an acid and base problem, since acid-base chemistry is prevalent in biochem and it&#x27;s quite easy at the freshman level.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_equilibrium</a><p>As you can see, the treatment is a little bit more complicated than Boolean algebra. There are terms for Gibbs free energy, chemical potential, activities, solubility potentials, etc. to consider for a system sitting in some glassware. I won&#x27;t get into the details, but do make note of the math. Can you think of how to compute these quickly in silico or by hand? Probably not too hard.<p>We&#x27;re just getting started though. Things get rather noisy as we start to consider more than a few chemicals. As we trend up towards approximating an in vivo system, we also have to developing a model for interaction. To do that, we have to understand each component. At both ends, we enter into the realm of statistical thermodynamics. Here you&#x27;ll encounter much more complicated models and concepts such as canonical ensembles:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_canonical_ensemble"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_canonical_ensemble</a><p>You know can&#x27;t simply consider aggregate systems as pairwise interactions or summations or any other trivial model. For one, there are too many incredibly localized chemistries within solution that produce rich behaviors. For example, here&#x27;s a decent figure that presents a chemical transport process: <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2980713/figure/fig1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2980713/figure/f...</a><p>All of the familiar, easy math typically involves equilibria, and equilibria systems are nice and easy systems to study. But to be alive is to not be at equilibrium--one facet of biology is to push against that state as long as possible. Nonequilibrium systems present further computational and modeling challenges for us. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_equation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_equation</a><p>I&#x27;ve presented a bunch of math, and I&#x27;m not done yet. It&#x27;s known that Metabolic pathways, the interplay interacting metabolites, happen to be NP-hard. Typical of graphs, fairly orthodox. The computational complexity of the topology isn&#x27;t really isn&#x27;t expressive enough to convey the beauty of a graph edges themselves--that they are in constant flux, connected through a chemical calculus. Chaotic, transient metastabilities that arise and collapse. Digital bits blink, but chemicals dance.<p>Do you know the breadth and depth of this machine? Here&#x27;s a wonderfully illustrative map of the known metabolic pathways--at a glance it&#x27;ll give you an instant perspective if you didn&#x27;t already have context: <a href=""http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/bio_sim/articles/metabolic_pathways.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/bio_sim/articles/metabolic_pa...</a> (When observing the forest, be careful not to forget what the trees actually represent. There is unfathomable complexity to be found in the small interactions.)<p>It probably dawns on you now that we&#x27;re <i>not going to live to see the answers</i>. I&#x27;ve only really introduced metabolites here. Gene regulation, proteins... I never even mentioned the word &quot;cell&quot;. That&#x27;s far too much.<p>If it doesn&#x27;t make sense why bioengineering is slow-paced, then I did a poor job at conveying how hard the problem space is. Yes, we can make certain gene products and achieve simple little results that still dazzle us. It&#x27;s not quick, it&#x27;s leagues away from what we want, and it&#x27;s definitely not abstractly or generically portable. (I don&#x27;t refer to the assays/methods.)<p>I suspect the only way to enter into the biological renaissance requires that we get better at everything else: math, low-level logic, algorithms. I imagine we&#x27;ll have to find ingenious new ways of greatly contracting the problem space, reducing dimensionality, operating over compositions of subgraphs, etc. in order to deal with computing the complicated nonlinear dynamics at interaction level. Integration into an acceptable holistic model is mind-boggling. How to do this and get meaningful results, I have no idea. Whatever far future tools that might be effectively applied to this will appear to have bent the Matrix.<p>Thinking of today&#x27;s &quot;big data&quot;, I can&#x27;t help but feel dwarfed at a truly astronomical scale. The depth of ignorance we&#x27;ll eventually have to cross in order to solve the problems presented by a single cell... it puts everything into perspective.<p>Sorry for the long post. I hope I illustrated that the core tendencies of electrical engineering and computer science towards simplification and logic reduction are simply not very amenable to bioengineering. You can&#x27;t simply tweak one thing or edit the binary. Everything touches everything, and you can&#x27;t adjust the weights and levers without understanding the ultimate runtime behavior. You already know that line from Jurassic Park about the weather...",1409295072

8241409,comment,8239251,8239251,43,0,pqs,,,"This is a well known practise in Spain. I com from Spain and I have always seen my family (parents and grandparents) drinking coffee after lunch and, then, doing a nap on the couch. Usually, we sit on the couch, take the coffee together and then every person takes a newspaper or magazine and after a few minutes of pseudo-reading everybody is sleeping or in a state of deep relaxation. We sleep for 20 minutes. That&#x27;s all. I guess this is very common in Spain.<p>This works well because we often take lunch at home. But, now that I have lunch at the office, I do the same. I have a 1 hour pause. The first half hour I have lunch, then I take the coffee and I go to the office to sleep on the floor, on a very thin mattress. If my brain is too active, I listen to a foreign radio station with my iPhone. I like to listen to ICI Radio Canada (in French). When I have lunch here, they broadcast the morning news and commentary. The news are about stuff happening in Quebec. It is interesting enough for me to forget the work stuff, and dull enough to induce me into a deeper relaxation state, which allows me to fall sleep fast. Being the broadcast in a foreing language, also helps to fall sleep. I often dream during this 20-30 minutes naps.<p>An interesting detail is that I had to learn this habit. I remember being a child and being pissed off because I wasn&#x27;t allowed to make noise after lunch. Now, that I&#x27;m a father, the roles are changing and I&#x27;m the one sleeping after lunch.<p>By the way, at night, in order to fall sleep, I never take phones, tablets or computers to my bedroom. Instead, I take a shortwave radio and I tune the BBC world service news (fortunately, in Spain we can hear the broadcast directed to Africa). I put a 30 minutes timer on the radio and I almost never hear it stopping, because I fall sleep before. The day that the BBC will shut the SW broadcast, I guess I will take a bluetooth headset or speaker to my bedroom, but not the iPhone. It is very important to avoid computers in the bedroom.",1409295036

Perhaps it is truer at banks than anywhere else - although I suspect as much, I can&#x27;t be sure. Bank software is basically about implementing in code, processes that were developed to be applied solely by humans 100 years ago or more. It&#x27;s all the same stuff. There is nothing new. It&#x27;s so bad that, after an organizational change, even if there is no logical reason that this change should affect the software running the bank at all, it will anyway, because some existing piece of technology was the old guy&#x27;s pet project, and so the new guy needs his own pet project. And all projects are pet projects. And so on.<p>And that&#x27;s just on the tech side. Of course, on the business side, technology is a cost to be grudgingly paid out and worked on, at best. And once the technical debt gets to be unworkable, someone comes up with the great idea to hand everything over (or in pieces, whatever) to a vendor. But then eventually the cost structure there gets too onerous as well, and so the business tries to replace it in-house again, after spending the last decade clearing out all their in-house expertise. And so the cycle continues.<p>Some banks are worse than others, but if this article has you thinking that maybe at Goldman Sachs, or Credit Suisse, or Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank, technology isn&#x27;t an absolute shit-show, well think again. And these places run the world economy while their technological infrastructure is held together by duct tape.<p>The article is right, of course, that banks will still be around in 20 years. Obviously. But, the big banks have known they need to get their act to together for, at the very least, <i>forty damn years</i>. And not a single one of them (not one!) has done it. And they never will, because they are dominated by a culture going back two hundred years that will not ever let engineers anywhere near the levers of the business, which is where they need to be, and for that matter will most of the time not invest profits back into the business when they can funnel it into their own bonus instead.<p>If you want to disrupt banks, start a bank! Start a bank where you can do things and enter markets that the big guys can&#x27;t, because their tech is half-assed and they aren&#x27;t creative enough to do anything about it.

If anything, the super-string theorists are more like philosophers in the sense that they are working mainly with thought experiments, which they then try and reconcile with reality. If you read stuff written by cognitive philosophers on the mind, they do this all the time, proposing postulates and thought experiments, and then trying to rationalize them with the assumptions about the real world, often, with no reference to actual neuroscience.<p>Krauss et al&#x27;s statements on philosophy are simply that when you build a particle accelerator, walk into a lab, or start working out mathematical theories, you don&#x27;t start with philosophy of science. That&#x27;s a backwards rationalization of how science is done, constructing it&#x27;s underpinnings/justification after the fact. Most scientists who conducted experiments and proposed hypotheses throughout history did not start by first making sure what they were doing aligned with the Philosophy of Science. And indeed, children conduct scientific investigations all the time blissfully unaware of the philosophical underpinnings justifying it.<p>I&#x27;ll go one further and say that the idea that you never need to do &quot;what if&quot; theories, but merely explore the existing ones to their ends, can lead to local optima. It is certainly possible you will run into the limits of the conceptual underpinning of the theory in which no iterative refinement can fix it in a way that leads to superior understanding.<p>Philosophy is useful, in the same way that logic and mathematics are useful, to explore formal systems, especially when the real world experiments are impossible or unethical to conduct. But the limits of philosophy are also born out in the assumptions used -- e.g. arguments about free will or consciousness, debates are artificial definitions that do not measurably or provably reflect the real nature of real things.<p>Perhaps a better commentary here: <a href=""http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/08/23/accommodationism-from-a-physicist/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2014/08/23/accommoda...</a>",1409292989
