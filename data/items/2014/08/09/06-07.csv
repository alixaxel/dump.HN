8156399,comment,8152944,8156152,1,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"Part of the issue is that sometimes reducing transaction costs gets them so low that the activity ends up being done by the individual rather than a business entity.<p>The other side of that coin is the &quot;commoditize your complements&quot; thing. If you make X cheap and people who have X want or need Y, whoever is selling Y is going to grow like a weed.<p>So that&#x27;s kind of what we&#x27;re seeing. Things either get so easy that you don&#x27;t need to find somebody else to do them, or they don&#x27;t while everything else does, in which case that thing becomes a bottleneck in the low transaction cost economy and the entity providing it turns into a giant business corporation.",1407567533

B. Priestley was calling Penguin &quot;a grand publishing feat.&quot; Amazon is rewriting history when they say the literary establishment hated paperbacks.<p>And, of course, Orwell was the last man in the world one could reasonably accuse of being a pawn of corporate interests. He was a revolutionary and a socialist who went to Spain to fight against fascists. He was uncompromising in his examination of even his fellow travelers: 1984 is a criticism of the Soviet Union and abstract leftist thought.<p>Finally, if you&#x27;re going to invoke Orwell, you should have the intellectual honesty to link to both people who agree with you and people who disagree with you. You should also not call yourself Readers United. I&#x27;m a reader; I have some sympathies with Amazon, but I am not united behind this any more than all authors are part of Authors United.",1407567208

8156390,comment,8155153,8155153,3,0,facepalm,,,"There are even more interesting implications of the &quot;war&quot;: women are fertilized inside the body so that fathers can not be sure whose offspring a child is (because the fertilization can not be seen, other than with eggs, for example) - otherwise they might kill the offspring of other fathers (our ancestors would have, that is). Furthermore, women try to hide their fertility as much as possible, other than most other mammals. Iirc that is for the same reason: since men can not be sure when the woman was fertile, they can not be sure who made her pregnant. But if they don&#x27;t know when a woman is pregnant, why even have sex? And that is why sex is fun. We take it for granted, but apparently it is only fun for very few species.<p>I recommend &quot;Why sex is fun&quot; by Jared Diamond for a fun read...

I was near the best in my class in Biology and Chemistry but I didn&#x27;t really enjoy them- if I did I probably would have gone to the larger UC than the smaller liberal arts school I&#x27;m going to attend. Everything else was a mixed bag. I enjoy writing when it&#x27;s on something I&#x27;m interested about, I dislike it when it&#x27;s rote, but what I&#x27;m interested in is usually fleeting. That tends to apply to motivation too. I can get aroused for a lot of work in one case, and in another similar case I can&#x27;t be bothered.<p>I guess my favorite piece of work in the last two years was a project in regular economics. We were divided into groups and ordered to create a business model in report style. We created Fatoline.<p>Fatoline was dreamed up in response to an unsustainable America. This unsustainability is rooted in the suburban commute lifestyle- people drive everywhere, consuming vast amounts of gasoline and gaining weight. The Fatoline company has two public fronts, its liposuction service and its gasoline service. We take the fatty liposuctioned tissue, put it through some huge centrifuges, introduce some modified lipases (modified through science magic) and heat and boom, we have gasoline, which is sold through our other front.  This keeps the automobiles running, the people skinny, and keeps the suburban structure of the U.S. stable. Only now, instead of nasty foreign oil coming in, we have the wholesome, local fat-conversion company keeping our lifestyle afloat.<p>Unfortunately, after crunching the numbers, it turned out that for this system to work, each person would have to produce some obscene amount of fat each year, somewhere in the thousands or ten thousands. No matter though. Once we figure out how to get people to be able to get that big, the dream is definitely alive.<p>I guess I liked the project because it involved a little bit of everything.",1407567078

To think that the female reproductive system developed prior to the fetus (in order to pave way for nurturing of the embryo) is implying evolution is a purpose-driven, goal-oriented process - a line of reasoning not too far from &quot;intelligent design&quot;.<p>Not to mention the egg-chicken dichotomy is absurd. There was neither a &quot;first chicken&quot; nor a &quot;first egg&quot;.<p>Single celled protists first developed sexual reproduction about 2 billion years ago as a means of producing genetically variable offsprings. It may be assumed both the offspring and the reproductive machinery of the parents developed concomitantly as life was making a shift from uni-cellularity toward multi-cellularity.<p>As for mammals (which includes us humans), the placenta, which serves as an important barrier between the mother and the fetus (only letting nutrition pass through), is of viral origin. Placental syncytiotrophoblasts SCT-1, SCT-2 proteins are derived from endogenous retroviruses. Our genome is full of fossils of viral DNA - accumulated over several millions of years.

To take this to an extreme, a compiler that deletes any source files that contain UB could be compliant, but would also be one that no one ever wants.&quot;</i><p>While I would agree it should not be taken as &quot;you <i>should</i> do anything&quot;, I disagree with the notion that it should not be taken as &quot;you <i>can</i> do anything&quot;.<p>For the situations I use C and C++ in:<p>1) I&#x27;m simply not willing to pay the price to catch all potentially dangerous UB at build time.  My build times are bad enough as is without forcing a full static analysis pass during every iteration, and those still have holes and false positives.  The laws of physics prevent us from paying some currently unimplemented O(N^crazy) checks that would certainly catch some bugs... and O(N^3) is bad enough, from what I hear.<p>2) I&#x27;m simply not willing to pay the price to mitigate all potentially dangerous UB at run time.  I already spend more time optimizing than I&#x27;m happy with - making the compiler do less means I&#x27;ll have to do more, which has an opportunity cost:  I&#x27;ll have less time to hunt down non-UB dangerous code.  As such, I&#x27;m happy to have ASLR and NX bits, but I won&#x27;t be turning off my optimizer nor enabling the more paranoid compiler-generated bounds checking.<p>If this means a malicious attacker manages &quot;rm -f /home/user/project/all-my-undefined-code.c&quot; through a buffer overflow rather than unsanitized input strings, so be it.<p><i>&quot;It&#x27;s also worth mentioning that the &quot;UB = optimisation&quot; advocates seem to be mostly academics with an intense interest in replacing C with &quot;safer&quot; languages... and there&#x27;s no better way to further their own agenda than to &quot;legally&quot; disparage C and make it a worse language than it should be.&quot;</i><p>I have an interest in replacing C with &quot;safer&quot; languages - specifically the kind that can better do safety and speed simultaneously.
