Too often these sorts of virtuous changes are done because a) everybody experiences the problem, and b) the proposed solution is politically useful to somebody.

8156802,comment,8154551,8156696,4,0,wpietri,,,"I&#x27;ve been involved with the Agile movement since before the term &quot;Agile&quot; existed, so I can say with some authority that your managers are idiots twice over.<p>First, I do encourage to start with physical boards, but that&#x27;s because I encourage teams to work in the same place. Agile methods work best with low-latency, high-bandwidth, always-on communication, and by far the easiest way to get that is by sitting in a dedicated team room. But if it&#x27;s impossible for the team to be together, yeah, a white board just won&#x27;t cut it.<p>Second, the point of all of the Agile approaches is to have teams continuously improve their process in response to local conditions. There is no single Agile process. There are common starting points, and that often includes a white board or a card board because those are very flexible tools that everybody feels comfortable adapting. But if the whole company is supposed to be doing exactly the same manager-dictated process, then it is definitionally not Agile, because of points 1 and 4 in the manifesto. [1]<p>On a personal note, I want to offer you an apology. It makes me sad that something with such promise for liberating employees and making work better has turned into just another stick to beat employees with. That is the exact opposite of what a lot of the early Agile people intended. I&#x27;m very sorry that we weren&#x27;t more diligent in preventing the movement from getting co-opted by existing power dynamics.<p>[1] <a href=""http://agilemanifesto.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://agilemanifesto.org/</a>",1407588956

8156798,comment,8155832,8156568,11,0,jeremyjh,,,"Unfortunately I found it really takes a lot of work on practical programs to get past the stage where you have these sort of doubts. Finding the motivation to do so can be a chicken-in-egg type of problem.<p>Technically you are incorrect about exceptions needing to change the type of pure functions, but in fact I would always prefer to return an Either and so it does result in code changes up the stack. However it may not mean very many changes to signatures; a function used by only one parent shouldn&#x27;t be top-level and doesn&#x27;t need a signature. And the result is a function that captures failure modes in its type, which means other consumers can&#x27;t forget to handle failure (though they can explicitly choose not to if they want to just throw an exception on failure). This may feel a bit verbose and unwieldy at first but it actually is very powerful once you know the techniques.<p>The concern about IO - you don&#x27;t say this but a lot of people worry about logging output to STDIO for debugging. But Debug.Trace will do this impurely for debugging purposes. Otherwise its actually pretty rare that you write a pure function that later turns out to need IO. IO should usually stay in top-level functions that provide the over-all program / routine structure. I&#x27;m only at a journeyman level with Haskell but I&#x27;ve written over 20,000 lines of real code and can&#x27;t remember ever really running into this problem, though I did worry about it when just getting started.",1407588819

Yet library usage is dramatically down over the last few decades.   This suggests to me that there is little demand for cheaper books.<p>The biggest &#x27;cost&#x27; to reading a book for many is not the money spent to acquire the book, it&#x27;s the several hours of leisure time required to read the book, time that could be spent doing something else.<p>This suggests to me that the overall book demand curve is fairly inelastic.<p>That Amazon sees more elasticity is not surprising: they&#x27;re conducting experiments on part of the market.

The store was so crowded no more than 4 people could be in it at one time and searching LPs involved having the owner do feats of acrobatics to shuffle boxes around. Most of it was junk, but he did have some gems if you told him what you were looking for.<p>After buying a few inches worth I talked to the owner a bit: He had, by his estimate, 200k LPs, most of which were off site in storage. He had moved to Kowloon from the mainland without a dollar to his name and lived on the street. When CDs hit the scene (I&#x27;m guessing mid-80s to early 90s) the status-conscious HK residents started literally dumping their LP collections out on the curb. Decidedly forward-looking for a homeless guy, the owner started collecting them in one pile on whatever street he occupied. He slept under the same plastic tarp that protected his collection from the rain for 20 years.<p>When the vinyl resurgence hit he did a fairly brisk business, was able to buy some property and a Harley. He met the president of Harley Davidson while he was in HK -- something that got him visibly excited when he talked about it. Pretty cool guy.",1407587806

8156775,comment,8156267,8156512,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Price elasticity is only part of it. Another major factor is consumer surplus. Consumer surplus manifests itself in book sales largely through hardcover sales. The existence of hardcover editions and the fact that they are initially first to market (typically by many months to a year) provide a window of opportunity to tap the consumer surplus in the market, which they do. You&#x27;ll notice that many hardcover editions are often discounted extremely after the paperback comes out, sometimes to nearly comparable values.<p>There is no such market segmentation or opportunity to capture the consumer surplus with e-books, so potentially that money is just lost. Does greater volume of sales make up for that? Who knows, Amazon hasn&#x27;t provided enough data. On the plus side, Amazon is incented to maximize their own revenue and since authors get a percentage of the book sales revenue in theory that means Amazon should be incented to maximize author revenue as well.
