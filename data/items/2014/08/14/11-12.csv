As a front-end dev, it isn&#x27;t enough to just have clean, semantic HTML and clean css and js. You are getting ready to build a site where you can and should experiment with various technologies that you have interest in, but haven&#x27;t had the opportunity to use them in a project yet.<p>Have a section dedicated to &quot;current front-end experiments&quot; where you just build cool stuff and show it off. Take things you are particularly proud of, try to abstract them to their core idea, and throw it on github.<p>I am going to agree with another user that you need to show proficiency with a front end framework, either Angular, Backbone, or Ember.<p>Also, a blog attached to your site where you discuss working on your experiments is nice too.<p>What do you currently send prospective employers when you apply for jobs as far as code? Throw that up there too.<p>I&#x27;ve been applying for jobs recently and don&#x27;t have a portfolio site. I&#x27;ve been getting interviews just from my resume,one project that I built start to finish that I still manage, and a few small angular apps that are super simple. So if you would rather build a functional purpose built site, that is OK too.<p>I am not saying that devs shouldn&#x27;t have portfolios, but I feel that they are more necessary for a designer, because that is one of the only ways they CAN show their work.",1408017213

The idea was that you could develop your application on a puny PC and run it unmodified, much faster, on a serious machine with a serious OS. With a serious price tag, but that&#x27;s another issue.<p>Java was also designed to be fashion-compatible: it had OO, its syntax resembles C/C++-ish languages, it is statically typed, and it could be used to run programs inside web pages (as well as on mostly anything with a decent CPU). All things were compelling in the late-90&#x27;s. The fact Sun spent a whole company promoting and developing it also helped a lot. It didn&#x27;t help Sun that much, in the end. It&#x27;s a shame. SPARC boxes were amazing. It&#x27;s really sad all those beautiful architectures could not compete with the evolving x86.",1408016912

8176886,comment,8172980,8175794,3,0,discreteevent,,,"The dream of reuse has made a mess of many systems. The value of components (you can call them microservices if you like) lies in <i>independent</i> entities communicating over well defined interfaces. This means that you can split work up into manageable units (and distribute the work across teams if you want to). But if things are genuinely independent then we have to accept that there will be some redundancy. As long as you stick to communicating with another component through its top level protocol/interface then things are OK. The temptation is to notice that there is something else the other component does internally that you would like to re-use in your implementation. So you ask them to expose that. This is where it starts to go wrong. You have increased the complexity of interaction with the other component just to get some re-use. Do this a few more times and the system becomes unmanageably complex. Its like any organisation. If you want to succeed you need to be able to delegate fully and don&#x27;t try to micromanage people for the sake of some minor optimisation.<p>So the thing is to be disciplined. Only communicate over the formal interface and mind your own business/implementation. That means don&#x27;t get involved in other peoples business and when other people try to get involved in yours tell them to $@&*!... please move along. Michael feathers has a good post [1] about how in COM it was hard to create components and so this enforced this kind of discipline. I think that another thing about COM was that you never got the source code for a component, it was always binary and the only thing that was published was the interface. This prevented people from nosing around in other peoples implementation. Feathers&#x27; point is that microservices are similar: Its hard to create a microservice so the granularity does not end up getting too fine. But to my mind there is no need to pay the price (failures, administration) of having to distribute a service just to get low granularity.  Sure, if you want to distribute in order to scale that&#x27;s fine. But otherwise just have your components in process and be disciplined about your interfaces. (Besides, microservices aren&#x27;t that hard to make; Once you have made a few of them so you are going to have to have discipline there too)<p>[1]<a href=""https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/microservices-until-macro-complexity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://michaelfeathers.silvrback.com/microservices-until-ma...</a>",1408014284
