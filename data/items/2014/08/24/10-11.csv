It&#x27;s just that in the Schengen area the controls between member states are more or less random and not necessarily at the border.<p>Some people may never see a border control and others might see it more often.

8218207,comment,8215419,8217445,1,0,walterbell,,,"It can be done on a dedicated PC, ideally one that supports h/w virtualization (VT-x and VT-d). People who want to purchase a new PC would need known-good configs. The suggested devices are relatively cheap (no Windows tax, the Dell one officially supports drivers for RedHat Linux) and can be used as PCs. With virtualization support, one could run a local Windows desktop, analytics in a Linux VM, and NAS storage in a separate Linux/FreeBSD VM - all on the same computer.  For defensive security, you want to separate a read-only content store from potentially-vulnerable programs which parse & analyze data in the content store.<p>As someone said in another comment, the challenge with these solutions is making them usable to a mass audience who won&#x27;t know or care about Linux.  Android & OS X both created user experiences that hid the underlying Unix OS.  If someone can only afford a single computer, then virtualization allows that device to play the role of both &quot;server&quot; and &quot;desktop&quot;.<p>With local s/w RAID, the system can be designed so that backup consists of (1) shutting down the computer, (2) removing one hard drive, replacing it with another, (3) take the (encrypted) hard drive to offsite location, e.g. trusted friend/family.<p>> The only thing left is FLOSS version control for sound and video editing<p>Coud you expand more on this use case? Do you mean archiving binary blobs and storing their metadata in git? git-annex does this and camlistore can be adapted for this purpose. Is this only for local production workflow, or is there a need for remote collaboration on pre-final artifacts?<p>>  an effective &quot;publish to BitTorrent&quot; feature<p>Could you spec out what&#x27;s needed? Are there trackers which specialize in public domain content?  Strong DRM is coming to browsers and new hardware.  While it will create unexpected user experiences and change the web as we know it today, it could increase demand for public domain content.  We are going to need distribution channels for public domain content which treat copyrighted content like viruses, i.e. reject before they can enter the channel.<p>The same fingerprinting techniques used for copyrighted content can only be used to improve discovery of public domain content.  This means central directories (which can be cached locally) of metadata and hash/fingerprints for public domain content (text, audio, video, raw data).<p>Another feature: support for software agents that take action based on computed result of (remote event + private data).  A FLOSS version of IFTTT, Yahoo Pipes, e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/cantino/huginn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cantino/huginn</a> .  A remote event could be a private signal from a mobile device app. This would increase flexibility since the user has a larger private dataset about themself than any web/cloud service.  The user can configure FLOSS algorithms, instead of relying on remote black boxes without appeal or transparent governance.",1408877083

So I&#x27;d say our culture is getting increasingly easy-bored.<p>I think the main reason for this bias is that marriages in the past were primarily an economic construct, merging the wealth of two families, where the married couple were only the vehicle for binding the contract. This, plus of course the economic benefits of spawning and raising kids. You can see this today in parts of the world where people still do arranged marriages.<p>Compared to prostitution, this would be like the difference between a cozy corporate job and freelancing in an unstable market. In the first case, you get insurance, health benefits, stable and predictable salary, and you expect to be employed for long time - so you and your family can make long-term plans. In the second case, you don&#x27;t get any of that, and your main concern is whether you&#x27;ll earn enough money now to last through an unpredictably-long period of time where there won&#x27;t be any work for you to do - so you can&#x27;t plan ahead at all.",1408876274

This was asked despite my already having legally entered and having remained continuously within the Schengen area (my passport, already displayed by that point, contained the entry stamp, ironically from an airport in Germany), and despite my already having entered Germany twice on that trip.<p>As a result I am extremely skeptical of the idea that Germany has an &quot;open border&quot; or &quot;no border controls&quot; for intra-Schengen travel.
