Basic income needs to be continuously calibrated relative to the cost of basic living. That said, I don&#x27;t see any good reason to expect that the price of say food would rise beyond people&#x27;s ability to buy. Western countries already produce way more food than is necessary, so supermarkets end up throwing a lot away. With increased demand there would be increased production of food, clothes, and other essential items.<p>Market forces would still be in effect, so rent prices would reach a new equilibrium. As long as there are more apartments than people, rents would stay at a level that people could afford (or the empty apartments would lower rents until people could afford to live there). If there are not enough apartments, more would be built in cheap locations to satisfy demand. Sure, basic income wouldn&#x27;t make everyone able to live in New York, but that&#x27;s not the goal.",1408870503

The conditions you&#x27;re describing - a surplus in supply for a range of market goods (mostly low-skilled human labour) is the <i>result</i> of the continued attempts of Western countries to regulate against free market dynamics. Removing the perverse regulations which caused this imbalance to arise would result in a short, hopefully not too harsh correction, after which supply and demand would again equalise across the range of various market goods in question.<p>It&#x27;s similar to the situation of a hypothetical (or not so hypothetical really) society which decided to &quot;help out&quot; potato farmers by limiting the price of a kg of potatoes to $10. What would you expect? Potato production would skyrocket as people try and cash in on the boom, while potato buying would plummet as people switch to unregulated alternatives.<p>Imagine this situation continuing on, with more and more vegetables becoming price-controlled, all the while as the mass of unemployed farmers grows and grows (because the system supports people in their failure to be vegetable farmers with unemployment handouts), the conditions of the market become worse and worse, and the further distortionary actions (for example, police crackdowns on blackmarket vegetable sales) required to sustain the whole system become more and more extreme. When someone questions the need for the price restrictions, the average citizen responds:<p>&quot;Vegetable markets would not magically become free markets (in the textbook-definition sense) if there were no regulations. People are forced to grow vegetables, there aren&#x27;t enough buyers per grower to make the demand high enough to make the market fluid, and a single buyer can influence the price.&quot;<p>Of course, this really isn&#x27;t hypothesis.
