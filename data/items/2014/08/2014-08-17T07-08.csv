This is not a city that has grown to 120k over 1000 years and which disappeared in a blink, this is a village that was overgrown because of the coal mine activity in the past 100 years, and just like in all modern countries which made the switch from coal to something else, the economic activity went somewhere else and people with it.<p>So no, it&#x27;s actually very similar to cities in northen France, West Germany and South Belgium which lived from coal as well and quickly dropped in population as well.

8188881,comment,8188327,8188706,3,0,Broken_Hippo,,,"Full disclosure: a paywall prevents me from actually reading the article. However, to your comment, I would say that this doesn&#x27;t actually prove that people can treat themselves. If it were proven that people truly are competent to treat themselves, I think more people would have done so. Once you are in a cycle of despair, it isn&#x27;t always easy to see any way out. Every single option is void of hope of any sort. Broken hope.<p>Virtual therapy is hope in itself. I remember my parents taking me to a therapist when I was 14-15. I got caught shoplifting and they wanted to make sure I was ok. I really wasn&#x27;t - I know now that I&#x27;d been mildly depressed for years by that point - but the therapy was wasted. Why? A combination of the man being a Christian therapist (still with degrees) and them making me sign a release form - nothing I said to the man was private from my own parents. This was not a safe place and I never trusted the man. No trust and a high likelihood of judgement from multiple parties (and a high chance of disproval or over-attention) made me shut up. Virtual? I&#x27;d consider that now, especially if for free. Best of all, it is private. Safe. No one could even see me go into the therapists office. Other people have issues trying to find a therapist that they click with. A computer is allowed to be off, to be a little cold, to be somewhat matter-of-fact: Humans need a bit of caring and empathy to go along with it.<p>So much of the stuff online seems like a scam. My father, during a depressed phase, spent a thousand or two on a program that basically said &#x27;think yourself happy&#x27;. Common advice, which doesn&#x27;t work. Also basic is &#x27;just have faith in god (generally christian, but not always) and it will pass&#x27;. Actual help in any form is in short supply. Good sources stop well before practical help and tell you to talk to someone.<p>If my words sound a bit crazy, and not like normal people think, good. This is the stuff I have dealt with for the last 25 years or so in varying degrees. I generally haven&#x27;t had access to a therapist or even be able to afford a doctor, so I&#x27;m just stuck. It isn&#x27;t always bad, but it is always in the background.",1408261228

8188870,comment,8188374,8188733,6,0,glenra,,,"Video games and cartoons can be valuable learning experiences. We learn a lot through play. If you got into minecraft you&#x27;d be doing engineering. If you got into Wildstar or WoW or some other guild-based combat system you&#x27;d be learning leadership and social dynamics - how to keep a team together and happy - and also a certain amount of math. If you got into Quake-like games you might discover the modding community and get interested in learning how to be a level designer, a programmer, a visual artist, or an architect.<p>Or take &quot;watching cartoons&quot;. You might discover stop-motion and start making your own. Or if you got into Anime you might get interested in learning Japanese.<p>The Sudbury schools emphasize the power of boredom. When you don&#x27;t play videogames that much you might FEEL like you could play them all the time if allowed to. But if you were ACTUALLY allowed to, you&#x27;d eventually get bored and want to go deeper. And then you&#x27;d inevitably be learning stuff.

8188865,comment,8185503,8186729,4,0,tslug,,,"It&#x27;s not just commentary.  I&#x27;m a game developer (<a href=""http://davetaylor.name"" rel=""nofollow"">http://davetaylor.name</a>).  I assure you, capitalism + our national laws + the international treaties our nations have agreed to is a game.  It&#x27;s the Old Game.<p>Catch is, the rules (laws) of the Old Game are such a complex mess that we have to hire expensive lawyers at hundreds of dollars an hour just to interpret slivers of the rules that apply to our particular situations.  It&#x27;s not fair to those still at level 1 (in poverty) still learning to play the game and who can&#x27;t afford to pay people just to know the rules.  Even at level 100 (extreme wealth), no one likes that they have to hire armies of attourneys just to protect themselves from being the targets of lawsuits.<p>This is poor game design.  We learned years ago that players don&#x27;t read manuals.  That&#x27;s why games don&#x27;t come with them anymore.  We learned they can&#x27;t even stand tutorials.  What they want is intuitive gameplay and gentle pacing, so that their minds aren&#x27;t blown with the whole wad at once, and so that they can get a sense of steady progression and accomplishment.  That&#x27;s definitely not what the Old Game has to offer today.  Perhaps it once did, but not anymore.<p>Today, the Old Game essentially tells us: &quot;Congratulations.  You&#x27;ve graduated high school.  Maybe.  Now, the rules moving forward are... incomprehensible.  Don&#x27;t suppose you have a few law degrees?  Oh no, that&#x27;s right.  High school.  OK.  Better get a job, or you&#x27;ll be homeless and will starve.  Cool?  Oh, unless you&#x27;re rich, in which case, don&#x27;t worry about it.  You have no obligations.&quot;  You haven&#x27;t played any games like that because they wouldn&#x27;t be compelling.<p>Worse, the Old Game has evolved to a point where it now tries to place a monetary value on all things.  Its precept is that all your problems can be solved with money.  Need new laws?  Spend money on lobbyists.  Need new politicians?  Spend money on their campaigns.  Need a date?  Spend money on a dating service.  Need excitement?  Spend money on travel.  Need new cloud infrastructure?  Spend money on coders.<p>What modern game has a single currency that satisfies all your desires?  It&#x27;s hard to think of one, isn&#x27;t it?  That&#x27;s not by accident.  I assure you, we tried it.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  We discovered empirically that money just isn&#x27;t that satisfying.  You need things that can&#x27;t be bought, like random loot drops, level ups, status, new goals, friends, exploration, surprises, emergent behaviours, challenges, defeats, victories, romance, and more.  We&#x27;ve even learned the importance of breaks.  Too much is too much.<p>The Old Game is losing its competitiveness.  It would have flopped long ago if it were not for the fact that playing it is mandatory.  You need it to clothe yourself, eat, shelter yourself, and receive medical treatment to not die.<p>But read that list of items more carefully.  We have 3D printers marching steadily towards finer-grained resolutions with more materials and can now build just about whatever we need, even tools, homes, and clothes.  We have the ability to automate the gathering of our own energy, the ability to grow our own food (you can eat healthier with a fish tank and some algae than you can visiting most supermarkets now), the ability to diagnose and even treat ourselves.<p>The costs of living are plummeting.  We are approaching autonomy.  These things subvert capitalism, because they subvert your need to change the spin of more magnetic domains on your bank&#x27;s hard drive.<p>You are in an incredibly enviable position.  You have an enormous amount of potential excess income, probably a decent savings, and certainly a valuable skill set (for now- you know you can already feel the competitive heat from younger, cheaper minds than yours).  You can continue to play the Old Game while scaling back your dependency on it so that you can transition to a new game of your own choosing.<p>I get that it&#x27;s frightening, but I assure you, it&#x27;s mostly your addiction to money that makes it frightening.  The Old Game certainly hasn&#x27;t kept up with the times, but it does know how to addict its players, and it keeps us playing by frightening us with scary potential consequences if we stop playing it.<p>I don&#x27;t want to trivialize the risk, but to put it in context, the outcome is the same for all of us.  Game over is death.  You don&#x27;t lose or win.  There&#x27;s no high score or prize.  All we can do is decide what games we want to play getting there.<p>I don&#x27;t recommend playing the Old Game anymore than you absolutely have to.  It&#x27;s just not well designed.",1408260631

8188856,comment,8188374,8188563,2,0,PeterisP,,,"Much depends on the options that the kid even considers. If they&#x27;re growing up on a farm environment, then their natural curiosity will drive them towards the skills that are useful and interesting in that environment - from the article it appears that they are learning a lot of skills that are useful for a farmer or a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, since it brings immediate feedback and is consistent with the opportunities that they have there.<p>Have they interacted with lawyers, saxophone players, programmers, art historians, ballet dancers or microbiologists in any meaningful way to practically consider it a viable lifestyle that they could understand and identify with, to consider it as a normal available option? Given their current situation, will they do so in any time soon? A few years in college would do it but that&#x27;s a bit too late. You can&#x27;t really understand if you&#x27;ll like a profession if you haven&#x27;t seen/felt how the daily life of it looks like, that&#x27;s why this choice is often dominated by your local environment and public role models.<p>The point of general education is that kids are in the process of &#x27;searching for themselves&#x27; and a large part of them don&#x27;t and can&#x27;t choose their future direction until near-adulthood or later. If at the age of nine you&#x27;re consciously preparing to be an astronaut ninja fireman or unconsciously preparing to be a farmer, then it doesn&#x27;t really correlate with &quot;what your passion is&quot; and what you&#x27;ll want to do when you&#x27;re 20 or 30. And at that time point, if you have significant gaps in key education areas, then it cuts off your options. If after puberty you figure out you&#x27;d really like to be a doctor, and you spent two hours per month (as the article states) on science and math, then you&#x27;re simply not getting in med school.",1408260104

All of my favorite photographers have used them at some point or another.<p>I finally got a great deal on M6 with a 50mm Summicron. Now I have a M9P.<p>For a while, Leica was the only camera company to produce cameras with the same ergonomics of older film cameras. It may have been stubbornness on their part, but I loved the fact that I could have a digital camera that allowed me to control aperture with my left hand, change shutter speed with my right, and have all lenses have focus markings on the top.<p>I feel that Leica is in danger due to companies such as Fuji, who are creating cameras that have even more options for control than ever before.<p>Want manual focus markings? There are lots of new lenses from Fuji and Olympus that allow you to shoot with auto focus, then pull the barrel back and enter manual mode so you can do things like zone and hyperfocal focus.<p>Want to change aperture on the lens and shutter speed on the top? The xt1 and x100s both have it.<p>Sorry for hating, but if Leica&#x27;s answer to cameras such as the Fuji xt1 is to throw up a camera resembling a Sony NEX 3 with a &quot;better touch screen&quot; is kind of a joke really. They&#x27;re coming from totally left field with this one.<p>They can try and hold on to their legacy of amazing lenses such as the Noctilux, but Zeiss(sony) and Sigma are doing a lot of innovation on fast glass, and will soon probably come out with a 50mm f/.95 or faster lens just to shove it to Leica.<p>You can view my photos at &quot;moarbokeh&quot; on flickr if you&#x27;re curious.",1408259874
