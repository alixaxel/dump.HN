8221371,comment,8220500,8220500,3,0,frankydp,,,"Surprisingly, the US military embraced online learning a little more than a decade ago.  This was a boom for annual sustainment courses and the ability of highly active units to maintain OSHA, EPA, and other more job specific annual training requirements was greatly increased.<p>This great success in high level reporting percentages for training ended up driving even more training online.<p>This concept is a very slippery slope.  The amazing statistics that accompany online training will provide very direct motivation to administrator(generals).  Those administrators will easily come to the conclusion that training should be greatly standardized and moved online, due to the high level of efficiency.<p>In reality the DOD has moved some entire training programs to online.  The navy has moved entire A and C schools(basic job fields) online.  These are resident schools, and they are primarily schools based on hardware, that may also have strong software/theory based systems.  The result is highly drilled students with almost no real world or problem solving skills in the field that they have been schooled on.  I know this is anecdotal, but I have seen the change in the students first hand and the ability to teach critical analysis on a specific subject with out labs and 2 way live debate can not be underestimated.",1408967856

8221327,comment,8220500,8220500,5,0,ThePhysicist,,,"Well, how do you define a course? For me, it&#x27;s a series of individual lectures / modules that each teach you a given concept belonging to the same topic (that of the course). Concepts will often be dependent on each other, i.e. you will need to first understand concept A in order to be able to understand concept B.<p>So, taking apart a course and splitting it into modules might  make a lot of sense, since it allows students to only learn what is most relevant to them at the time and be rewarded for their learning successes more easily and more often. Considering the horrendous dropout rates of most MOOC platforms this might be a very good way to incentivize students to &quot;keep at it&quot;. However, this makes only sense if the individual modules are independent enough, so that students can learn about them individually (which, for many courses might not be the case).<p>For me, the concept of a &quot;course&quot; is mostly obsolete when delivering educational content online, and is probably mainly still in use because everyone understands what it means. It might even be a good example of skeuomorphism in this sense: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph</a><p>I currently work on a (real-world) course platform that allows people to take &quot;micro-courses&quot; which can be completed in one single evening session and which (mostly) build upon each other. Like this, students can decide more easily which skills they want to learn, get results faster and spend less money on the course.<p>A concept which is similarly outdated (in my opiniion) is that of a scientific journal: These were created to (physically) group articles from a given field together so that they could be distributed to people working in that field. Digital distribution through the Internet makes this obsolete, since articles can be simply grouped using tags (or other meta-information). Like this, the concept of a &quot;journal&quot; gets replaced by that of a &quot;view&quot; on a group of articles that are similar in a given way, such as &quot;all articles in the field of biophysics published last year&quot;, or &quot;all articles [across all domains] that investigate sleep patterns&quot;. Using views instead of a journals is vastly superior (again, in my opinion) since it allows you to search for knowledge spanning different disciplines and fields of research.",1408966447

Galaxy takes care of hooking everything up (data, scripts, intermediate results, etc) and provides a UI for watching/controlling the resulting job(s) on the desired HPC cluster.<p>The goal for this in biology is to address the explosion in data modern biologists have to deal with nowadays - it&#x27;s often completely overwhelming. Things like Galaxy increase both the accessibility of these command-line tools and also the large HPC compute resources traditionally dominated by users from the physical sciences.<p>Although it was a few years ago, it was rewarding seeing non-programmer users get onto HPC - importantly, while retaining control of their workflow - after they&#x27;ve struggled for so long on their local hardware. When you see jobs that took weeks or months run in hours or days, it&#x27;s almost like giving a desert explorer some water.<p>Systems like Galaxy do require dedicated systems people to support it and make it properly sing though.
