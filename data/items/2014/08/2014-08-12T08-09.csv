8167054,comment,8164712,8166229,1,0,samscully,,,"I have seen people in my neighbourhood (Bermondsey in London, UK) struggling with luggage twice, luggage that was clearly far too much for them to carry on their own. Both times I offered to help them take it from the train station to wherever they were going. The first time the man accepted my help, the second time the woman politely declined.<p>Even the first time I detected an uneasiness, partly because we were strangers of course, but also I got the sense that the man was very wary of putting on me at all. Perhaps because people like not having obligations towards their neighbours it feels wrong to accept help and thus set up an expectation of reciprocisity. Maybe this then leads to not offering help because it is assumed it will be refused?<p>London is a particularly atomised place of course, back home I think I would have got a very different response.",1407833991

8167052,comment,8166698,8166698,2,0,ilamont,,,"I did a ride-along with a cop outside of Boston about 12 years ago. His car had a laptop attached to the dashboard, an innovation that only started appearing in the 1990s. One thing that he was able to do was instantly look up the plate on a vehicle without having to radio it in -- and the lookup interfaced with what I assume was an updated database of stolen cars.<p>Another technological innovation he mentioned was the positive effect of the Lo-Jack stolen vehicle recovery system (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoJack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoJack</a>). It not only instantly sends stolen vehicle information to police systems, but also activates a beacon on the stolen vehicle which specially equipped cruisers can detect and follow.<p>I imagine innovations such as these impacted the theft rate over the past 25 years, and also helped law enforcement agencies identify and arrest serial offenders responsible for large numbers of thefts. Didn&#x27;t see it mentioned in the NYT article, though.",1407833978

In fact, it&#x27;s still exactly the same, just wrapped in new words.<p>The entire web is still client/server. Web apps? Client / server. Databases? Client / server. Just because more apps now insist on having a server to store data instead of making use of the microcomputer that they&#x27;re running on doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the last 25 years has been a reinvention of the same concepts again and again.<p>And even when &quot;Rich Internet Applications&quot; was the craze of the 90s, that was still just client/server, the concept that 70s mainframes had been coping with - they were servers and served clients.<p>Sure, there are loads more programming languages now instead of the choice of C and C++ (and maybe Delphi?) for Windows in the 1990s but underneath it is still doing the same.\nApart from now we have intermediate virtual machines and CLRs to intercede, perhaps unnecessarily?",1407833889

Apple doesn&#x27;t do this on x64 OS X (right?).<p>Furthermore, nothing has been said (AFAIK) about similar tricks Google is doing with Android on AArch64 or 64 bit architectures in general. From what I&#x27;ve heard they just made the Android runtime capable of emitting AArch64 (and x64, MIPS64) instructions instead of 32-bit ARMv7 ones.<p>That alone gives plenty of a performance boost as AArch64 instructions are supposedly quite a bit faster than the old 32-bit ones. It remains to be seen though whether Google can make as much use of clever allocation tricks as much as Apple can: Android is much more platform agnostic and uses a garbage collector for some of these tasks.",1407833423

8167015,comment,8150921,8150921,2,0,specules,,,"I&#x27;m an interaction designer and have 2 kids, ages 2 and 5. During the school year when my husband has his full-time public high school English teaching job (&quot;English&quot; = &quot;tons of lengthy essays and never caught up until the end of the school year&quot;), I am barely treading water. I dream of quitting constantly. It. Is. SO HARD. To afford the Bay Area mortgage in a modest little home, I work full-time year round, from the office 2-3 days a week, the other days from home. The WFH helps, but it&#x27;s not the panacea people think. You save time on the commute but you are surrounded by the things you didn&#x27;t prioritize (read: mess, unfinished to-dos) because you prioritized your kids and bills higher. And because you&#x27;re home, your work stops (if you&#x27;re Mommy) when the kids come home or when you pick up, whereas if I&#x27;m still at the office, I can (guiltily) still work an extra hour while my husband deals with pickup and dinner for both kids. It&#x27;s a trade-off, really.<p>Husband handles groceries and dishes and most cooking. We order more takeout/delivery than my parents ever dreamed, maybe once or twice a week. That helps a bit. I handle laundry and everything else, including hiring help to clean our house every two weeks, all the bills, money- and health-related stuff, clothing, school-related anything, buying whatever we need for the house, and I&#x27;m the person who drops their job when I get the dreaded and frequent call that one of my kids is sick at school, and then has to stay home while they recuperate and either burn a sick day and then inevitably my vacation days, or &quot;work from home&quot; meaning divide my attention ten ways from Sunday.<p>We live across the country from all our family except my younger brother who is not in a position to help watch kids. We do it all ourselves. So hard. I think about moving all the time but almost all our relatives whom I&#x27;d trust to watch our kids in a pinch all still have day jobs. In reality they couldn&#x27;t help. The one whom I&#x27;d trust has her own toddler to look after and I wouldn&#x27;t want to dump my sick kid on her so that her own child gets sick. My parents are retired but I don&#x27;t trust them to watch our kid. So moving across the country to be near family wouldn&#x27;t improve our situation at all. I think about moving to a cheap place where we could own the house outright, which would help some, but I did the math and I would still need to work at least part-time to pay the rest of the bills. And then I&#x27;d be stuck in upstate NY with its freezing winters and sweltering summers. So I haven&#x27;t made the leap yet. I&#x27;m hangin&#x27; on, in protest sometimes.<p>Our summer time schedule is more lax and I&#x27;m just figuring out this year&#x27;s schedule at a new elementary for the older one, but it will go something like this.<p>----- start -----<p>6 - 6:30) every damn day, 2yo wakes up and makes Mommy get up<p>6:30 - 7:30) I diaper, dress, feed, and pack lunch for the 2yo. (I can not pack ahead of time - picky guy only eats soup or dumplings which has to be warmed up and put in a thermos in the morning.) In that time, I also shower and get dressed, and my husband wakes up, showers, eats, and gets dressed.<p>7:30) Husband takes 2yo to daycare and goes to teach<p>7:30 - 8:15) 5yo wakes up, rush through morning routine: potty, get dressed, eat, tame her long hair, brush teeth. At same time, shove food in my face and pack AM and PM snack as they are not provided by school. Get out the door.<p>8:15 - 8:30) I take 5yo to school<p>8:30 - 4:30) Work/school/daycare. If working from office, hour-long commute for me from Lake Merced to downtown on Muni. Same if I drove to nearest BART with parking. Joy.<p>4:30 - 5:15) Husband picks up both kids OR<p>4:45 - 5:15) Husband and I split kid pickup if I&#x27;m working from home (see? save time commuting, spend time picking up kids)<p>5:15) cook, eat dinner, 2 allotted TV shows, play, see spouse if I&#x27;ve WFH<p>7:00) baths/pajamas, reading. If I worked in the office, I come home around this time.<p>8:00) one last snack<p>8:30) brush teeth<p>8:45) bed - I lie down with them as I still nurse my 2yo and enjoy the snuggle time. It means I don&#x27;t get things done like other parents, but it won&#x27;t last forever and I know they&#x27;ll grow up fast.<p>Middle of the night) I wake up from typically having fallen asleep with the kids, and cross things off my to-do list or catch up on work I never finished<p>6 am) Do it all over again, maybe having gotten a few more hours sleep, sometimes having worked all through the night<p>----- end -----<p>There&#x27;s no exercise in that schedule, no watching shows regularly. I could fit exercise in the workday but feel guilty at how much time I have to spend with family as it is, so I am loathe to take more attention away from work (except when procrastinating by commenting on threads like this!)<p>I know other people would make different choices and criticize mine, tell me I could fit in more if I moved this or that around, but fwiw that is our life, that is how we&#x27;re getting by at the moment, to answer your question.<p>I wish you all the best. Each family situation is different and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll find something that works, even if barely, haha. And once it works, it will change. :-)",1407832841
