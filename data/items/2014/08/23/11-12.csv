However, for the last year, I&#x27;ve been in Vietnam full time, giving up my apartment in NYC and &quot;relocating&quot; to Nevada for tax purposes.  I did this partly because I was getting closer to finishing up the first phase of the publishing project, but also because I found out I was going to be a father ;)<p>The hardest part is keeping work coming in at a constant enough rate.  In NYC I was always booked solid, 24/7, but in Vietnam it comes and goes in spurts.  Partly because some of the work I did in NYC has hardware requirements that can&#x27;t be met here in Vietnam (large retail experiential installs) and partly because business is slow for my main client.  Finding new clients to fill the gaps has required some serious email/linkedin networking hustle, but it can be done.<p>I&#x27;ve had people interested in hiring me for local projects, but I&#x27;ve had a hard time lowering my rates to a level acceptable for both parties.  Even though they are regaled by the amount of experience, developing countries might not be so focused on quality over quantity.  Which is OK.<p>If you take the time to get TEFL certification, that&#x27;s a possible fall back.

It&#x27;s not the best solutions that win, it&#x27;s the most fashionable.<p>To give you one example - look at how suddenly functional programming is the hottest thing around. Out of the blue, FRP is the thing to solve all problems. It&#x27;s 1970s technology. Just rediscovered now. I remember the times when functional programming wasn&#x27;t hip, and I was getting laughed at for being a &quot;Lisp (and Erlang) aficionado&quot;. But time has passed and the same people who were laughing then are now going to every possible Scala meetup and conference, because FP is now fashionable.<p>But we&#x27;re getting a bit tangential here. The core idea of my original post: manipulating ASTs and tree structures in editor is a problem with old and good solutions most people don&#x27;t know about, so, people, please go learn about them. It might save you some work (and spare the rest of us the horror of coding in XML because it&#x27;s the next hip thing).<p>> <i>If you truly think the old systems were better, then prove it!</i><p>I think there&#x27;s only one way to do that - you have to play around with them, experience them yourself.
