Many of them have student loans to pay off, and for many of them, getting a high-paying job post college is a serious consideration. In this regard, statistics is a great major, but computer science is flat-out ridiculous. When big tech companies are offering a Stanford graduate with only a few summers of programming internships under the belt for 150k/year, naturally a lot of kids are lured into computer science.<p>Then, once they start studying computer science, they discover this thing called machine learning. While I do think there is a difference in emphasis between stats and machine learning, the fundamentals are same, except the nomenclature sounds much cooler in machine learning. Nonparametric inference sounds esoteric and cryptic, but unsupervised learning sounds futuristic and cool.<p>The biggest problem with both statistics and machine learning education, I would say, is their lack of emphasis on mathematical foundations. When I was in college, CS229 (Introduction to Machine Learning) was touted to be the hardest class at Stanford. Having helped my friends wade through CS229 problems (a lot of which comes down to wading through linear algebra and multi-variable differential calculus), I do not think this is remotely true: CS229 is hard because it attracts students who do not have the requisite mathematical maturity to learn statistics/machine learning in a serious way (I am not even talking about the real-analytic foundation of probability and calculus but rudimentary linear algebra and chain rules).<p>Also, I do think CS229@Stanford is a great class that brings theory and practice together =)<p>As for R/Python/Matlab/etc., I will let the zealots argue what&#x27;s best.

The problem with Aereo is not that it is so good for consumers that some people aren&#x27;t getting &quot;their cut&quot;...it all boils down to advertising. With Aereo, it&#x27;s no longer truly possible to tell someone how many homes they are reaching with advertising dollars. How are network executives supposed to quantify how much they can charge to advertisers, now that they have even less of an idea of the effect of those advertisements? Also, since Aereo was being considered as on-par with the rest of the CATV providers, why weren&#x27;t they required to pay retransmission fees? Although I really did believe in Aereo&#x27;s promise of a better future, and I absolutely think that the future of television <i>is</i> streaming linear broadcasting, I always knew that it was going to be killed off by legislation because the cable industry is SO corrupt that there is literally no room for disruption.<p>On the other hand, Uber is not illegal. It never really was. Taxi cartels are attempting to twist the law to make it sound illegal. But really, Uber is just a dispatching service for limo companies that <i>already</i> exist. If you&#x27;re talking about UberX, that may be a different story. UberX is not available in all 90 cities that regular Uber operates in, but there are enough cities with just regular Uber service that it won&#x27;t be a problem if they have to shutter UberX for some reason down the line.",1409095156

While 14 CFR Part 91.119 allows flight below 500 AGL when over sparsely populated areas or open water, such operations are very dangerous. At and below 200 feet AGL there are numerous power lines, antenna towers, etc., that are not marked and lighted as obstructions and; therefore, may not be seen in time to avoid a collision. Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) are issued on those lighted structures experiencing temporary light outages. However, some time may pass before the FAA is notified of these outages, and the NOTAM issued, thus pilot vigilance is imperative.",1409094961

I&#x27;ve heard it has been...challenging.  It&#x27;s very difficult to find students from low-income backgrounds who can handle a freshman Amherst courseload.

College may provide the opportunity to students who put in the effort, but without time...they can&#x27;t catch up.  Students may put in a sustained effort over a long period of time (I think this may actually be the most effective approach, as opportunities tend to come to people who do this), but without opportunities, they&#x27;ll go nowhere.
