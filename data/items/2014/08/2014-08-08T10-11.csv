It is thus most often used to denote the money banks keep in various transactions. The meaning you specify in Dutch is most closely related to the use of agio to name the difference of the face value of silver coinage and their real metal content.",1407495492

Double entry accounting does is indeed a system for tracking balances of accounts but that&#x27;s not all it does and it might be said that balances are a by product of what it really does. Double entry accounting tracks the flow of how money _moves_ through a system. Using double entry accounting you can get track the balances of accounts at a certain date _OR_ you can track the movement of money through accounts over a certain time period which we call an income statement. I&#x27;ve noticed that developers seem to fixate over the former without understanding that the latter is just as important. In other words it&#x27;s not just important about how much money you have in an account but also how did the money get there?",1407495451

Integrating with calendaring apps or task management or CRM is either really hard because there isn&#x27;t a public API or the tools are very basic because the API has to easy to use, or the system is expensive to develop for being the API is complex. Plus the API ends up dictating how you organise the data rather than the business choosing how to use the tool - eg &#x27;every job must be part of a project that&#x27;s owned by a client&#x27; .. that sort of limitation quickly makes the tool inflexible and hard to use.<p>If you look at integrating with software development tools like ticketing or bug tracking you have to remember that in the majority of companies, even if you only look at software companies, most people aren&#x27;t developers once you get to more than about 10 staff. You have sales and admin and managers. What that means is that you either end up with a time tracking tool that does very little outside of tracking time or a time tracking tool with a raft of features that don&#x27;t apply to most of the people using it. Both of which are bad for some of the users.<p>All of this is compounded by the fact that most people don&#x27;t want their time to be tracked. Even if you love your job, having someone reviewing how you spent your time feels like you&#x27;re being micromanaged and watched over.

8152182,comment,8148854,8148854,2,0,netcan,,,"Ironically, one of the books that shaped my ideas on topics like this early on was the fictional <i>&#x27;The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism&#x27; by Emmanuel Goldstein</i> in &#x27;<i>1984.</i>&#x27; Orwell&#x27;s perspective as a dissident socialist is very unique and made for a lot of nuance. This is one of the places where it shines through, in my opinion.<p>In any case, in 1984-world there is an exam for moving the most talented of the middle classes into the upper class and least talented of the upper class to the middle. I think Orwell&#x27;s thinking here was a &#x27;keep the dangerous ones on the inside&quot; strategy. But, I think there&#x27;s another mechanism at work. Release valves and the creation of ambiguity.<p>A member of the underclass with undeniable talent and force of will is very dangerous to the order of things. If there are several of them pushing hard against a glass ceiling then pressure builds up. It also becomes very obvious the the ceiling exists. That&#x27;s where Malcolm Xs come from.<p>Malcolm X recalls in his autobiography about an incident where he told his teacher he wanted to become a lawyer. The teacher responds that this is &quot;not a realistic goal for a nigger&quot;. If he had become a lawyer he might have become one of the (as he saw it) one of those despicable, integration seeking middle class negroes. Blue pills.<p>Hitting a hard ceiling made the existence of the ceiling undeniable and the incredible force of his personality had no other outlet than pushing against this impenetrable ceiling.<p>I don&#x27;t know if how obvious it was at the time that Malcolm X had the potential in him that he obviously exhibited as an adult. But let&#x27;s imagine that the 12 year old Malcolm X was a 12 year old version of the 35 year old Malcolm X. A system that embraces that kid, makes him a lawyer. Gives him an outlet whiten it and celebrates him as an example of crossing class barriers or even proof for the non existence of those barriers is a more robust system.<p>BTW, I think it&#x27;s wrong to read 1984 as a description of a conspiracy. The conspiracy is more of a metaphor, a way of easily explaining how things work. In reality, societies are memoplexes, evolved. To paraphrase Douglas Adams. &quot;A memoplex that survives is a memoplex that survives.&quot; They are made up of surviving memes. Memes preventing class movement entirely are likely to bring down the memoplex. I think airtight class distinctions (such as a system of race based slavery) are fundamentally unstable for this reason.<p>There are interesting datapoints in accounts of ancient slavery. The Hebrew Bible describes a system of slavery with ways out existing in the ancient Middle east. Earning freedom. Sabbatical amnesties. Jacob came to Egypt as a slave. He rose to become a sort of chancellor to the Pharaoh. Ancient Greek & Roman systems of slavery had ways for exceptional slaves to earn freedom or even rise in rank within the institution of slavery. If Spatacus&#x27; leadership abilities had caused him to be ejected from slavery, his uprising would never have happened. He might have been a general enslaving barbarians and contributing gainfully to the system.",1407493246

It&#x27;s a collection of sketches and thoughts. It is also NOT the next version of Firefox. While some ideas might find their way into mainline Firefox at some point, many of the assumptions on which  Lightspeed is based are the exact opposites of Firefox core values (e.g. no settings or customization in Lightspeed).<p>More than anything else, Lightspeed helps us think outside the box that Firefox is. It&#x27;s a place where we can dare to explore more radical thoughts like not having any settings or or even menus. Having constraints like these stimulates creativity much like, for example, the character limit on tweets forces you to make your message more concise.<p>Ideas are worthless when they just exist in your head. Sketching out Lightspeed has helped us to make make lots of ideas more tangible, so they can be evaluated.<p>That being said, just reading through this thread has sparked some interesting new thoughts – we&#x27;ll keep experimenting :)",1407493220

Again, the question is, what is the right price for that service.<p>I&#x27;d say publishers are just a normal business. They provide some services that have some value. But they are not the gatekeepers they used to be anymore, hence authors should be able to get much better deals now.<p>As for marketing, a single person with a million followers on Twitter can probably achieve more than a whole traditional PR section of a big publisher?

Now, perhaps 500 of those books might have OK, and maybe 50 of them might have been quite good, and it&#x27;s entirely possible that the 1 book they <i>did</i> chose to publish, was not as good as 10-15 others they rejected - but, on the flip side, it&#x27;s highly unlikely that the publisher is going to chose one of the 500 dogs that never deserve to see the light of day.<p>The problem with Crowd sourced reviews, is that quite often, other people might like quite crappy books.  The job of a publisher isn&#x27;t to just find a book that <i>they</i> like, but that the general reading population will love.<p>I appreciate and respect what the publisher does as part of their filtering - I just suspect they are extracting more value than they are worth.<p>Hopefully established authors are able to negotiate increasingly more lucrative deals as a reflection of both the reduced risk, as well as the increased value they bring to the equation (as well as the reduced value that the publisher brings.
