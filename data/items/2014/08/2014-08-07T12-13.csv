The gist is that if you can&#x27;t automate with a computer, you aren&#x27;t really able to use the computer as a tool.<p>One could argue that if you&#x27;re able to use the computer to catalogue and enhance data, turn data into information (like visualizations) -- then you&#x27;re able to use a computer. A lot of this can be done in Excel (or another powerful spreadsheet program). But then most will also tell you that spreadsheets are visual programming tools. And that you might need to do (and automate) transforms on data that still need some form of &quot;actual&quot; programming -- be that VisualBasic, PowerShell, Awk/Sh -- or &quot;proper&quot; programming in a &quot;proper&quot; language.<p>Another side to &quot;everyone should know how to program&quot; (a side I find less interesting) is the growing need for software engineers, as we move to computerize more and more both public and private sector &quot;systems&quot;. I think the lack of engineering talent is real, but that&#x27;s not my main motivation for showing kids how to code -- just as I don&#x27;t teach kids how to do math because I hope they&#x27;ll work as mathematicians.<p>Math helps you think, helps you invent, and so can computers. If we want the next generation to be impatient for the kind of programs that we had, like Sketchpad. Or even an environment like Smalltalk -- I think teaching them to program is a good start. It&#x27;s also a great way to educate them how crappy (and simplistic as opposed to simple) many of the &quot;apps&quot; and games are.<p>For more, see eg: &quot;Doing with Images Makes Symbols&quot; by Alan Kay<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oonXT-gYjU"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oonXT-gYjU</a>",1407413333

If it&#x27;s the latter, you might want to slow down the rate of change, or at least change the way your coworkers do their jobs. Change how you work. If you need to change how everyone else works, get buy-off from other people before you impose.

They were willing to risk a massive diplomatic incident and outcry (toned down) by doing so.<p>He could travel by boat somewhere quietly, but (in my opinion) countries that have offered him some degree of asylum, such as Bolivia, Cuba and Venezuela are not stable or strong enough to oppose the will of the United States of  America.

I would recommend getting started right away on a website/landing page and building an email list. If the feature he wants is a 1 or 2 week thing maybe you can start ramping up marketing while the feature is being completed.<p>Check out articles/podcasts with patio11 and amy hoy as well . . . they are all fans of launching early to validate your idea, get feedback from paying customers and start generating revenue.<p>Good luck with the launch.",1407413164

It&#x27;s an inherently same culture, similar language, mentality and drinking habits, same religion. If you look at the beginning of the rebel conflict, you&#x27;d see a great deal of resistance on both side to engage in active hostilities. On more than one occasion Ukrainian troops were <i>talked</i> into turning back. People don&#x27;t want to fight, but they are being actively coalesced into it. There&#x27;s no simmering feud, no age-long hatred, no real reasons for fighting except for high-level geopolitics, which is why I think that Ukraine&#x27;s anti-president revolt didn&#x27;t happen in isolation, but as a response to something that happened earlier, of which Snowden seems to be the simplest explanation.",1407413022

8147223,comment,8143905,8146887,6,0,jeletonskelly,,,"I work in a clojure shop with about 10 other developers. Until very recently, we hired folks with zero exposure to clojure or even function programming. Do we use all the new bells and whistles that Rich and the folks at Cognitect develop for clojure? Yes, but we&#x27;re not jumping into the existing code base and refactoring everything to use core.async or reducers. Usually, one or two guys will use it in a less public, less critical piece of the infrastructure as a real-world application and then we do a code review with the whole team.<p>So, how do you build a clojure team, exactly? Don&#x27;t try to exclusively hire developers who have been exposed to it yet or have masters degrees from elite universities, focus on finding people who love to program, who are genuinely interested in improving their own abilities, but can clearly hold their own in the language they currently use. You will soon have a team of developers who love the challenge of keeping up with what guys like Rich Hickey (and Cognitect) are doing. We have been very successful with this.",1407412917

8147217,comment,8146433,8147038,12,0,pierrefar,,,"> Google treat the http and https versions of a domain as SEPARATE PROPERTIES.<p>That&#x27;s not quite accurate. It&#x27;s on a per-URL basis, not properties. Webmaster Tools asks you to verify the different _sites_ (HTTP/HTTPS, www/non-www) separately because they can be very different. And yes I&#x27;ve personally seen a few cases - one somewhat strange example bluntly chides their users when they visit the HTTP site and tells them to visit the site again as HTTPS.<p>> This means that even if you 301 every http page to https when you transition, all of your current rankings and pagerank will be irrelevant.<p>That&#x27;s not true. If you correctly redirect and do other details correctly (no mixed content, no inconsistent rel=canonical links, and everything else mentioned in the I/O video I referenced), then our algos will consolidate the indexing properties onto the HTTPS URLs. This is just another example of correctly setting up canonicalization.<p>By the way, if you&#x27;re moving to HTTPS, following our site moves guidelines:<p><a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/6033102?hl=en&ref_topic=6029673"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/webmasters/topic/6033102?hl=en&re...</a><p>specifically, the site moves with URL changes:<p><a href=""https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6033049?hl=en&ref_topic=6033084"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6033049?hl=en&r...</a><p>But you did say you have a client with an issue. I suspect they either implemented the move to HTTPS incorrectly or something else is going on.
