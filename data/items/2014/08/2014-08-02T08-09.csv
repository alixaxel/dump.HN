8124444,comment,8124022,8124324,2,0,baddox,,,"Yeah, I don&#x27;t think paulsutter&#x27;s post holds up to much scrutiny, except in the limited case where you have to make a decision immediately, or in the near future before you have time to do any meaningful research or calculation on the problem.<p>A problem is difficult when its potential consequences are serious and the best option is not obvious. But the best option can be non-obvious for two very different reasons: either it requires a lot of information and thus a lot of work to gather that information (like choosing a medical treatment), or it depends on randomness or other variables outside your control and understanding (like choose your lottery numbers, assuming someone gives you a lottery ticket).<p>For the latter case, it&#x27;s pretty clear that you can choose randomly and shouldn&#x27;t worry about your decision. For the former case, it&#x27;s reasonable to &quot;worry&quot; in the sense that you should feel an urgency to gather the required information efficiently. Of course, it&#x27;s not really that simple, because you have to optimize the cost of gathering information against the potential cost or gain from the decision itself. Also, the two reasons from the last paragraph are more like a continuum, because &quot;randomness&quot; is often <i>effective</i> randomness, i.e. you can&#x27;t feasibly predict the outcomes despite them being deterministic.",1406969648
8124443,comment,8121193,8122778,2,0,kolinko,,,"Yup. The concept of a blockchain is fundamentally incompatible with external inputs. That&#x27;s because at any given moment you need two things:\n- everyone to agree that the new block is valid (and you can&#x27;t really do that if blocks contained functions that had to be verified with external/changeable outputs)\n- everyone has to agree that all the past blocks were valid, which is even harder, because if blocks referenced external outputs, the sites/sources they relied on may have changed<p>That&#x27;s why not only Bitcoin, but also Ethereum and all the other blockchain-based currencies need oracles for passing external inputs in.<p>By the way, here&#x27;s our repo, if anyone&#x27;s interested in the whole concept: <a href=""https://github.com/orisi/orisi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/orisi/orisi</a> -- there are tutorials there explaining how to set up an example oracle, and an example client sending stuff to oracles to sign.<p>There&#x27;s also one of the core devs explaining this stuff: gavintech.blogspot.com/2014/06/bit-thereum.html",1406969637

Major problem is that decentralized systems are basically mobile hostile. Some companies have used these solutions to limit burden on their servers, pushing to burden to clients, which are then unhappy about it. Clients can consume a lot of cpu time, memory, disk space, disk access, cause lot of network traffic, be potentially used to generate DDoS attacks, or malicious traffic etc. All are great reasons why not to use decentralized solutions.<p>Zero Configuration is also basically impossible because you have to bootstrap the network some how. Fully decentralised solutions still require bootstrap information. Which is unfortunately hats enough for many and therefore works add efficient show stopper.<p>Last nail to the coffin is that most people really do not care about security at all. User base is after all just a small bunch of delusional geeks.<p>Otherwise something like RetroShare would be widely used.<p>I&#x27;ve been considering and wondering these same questions for several years.

The stories they chose to share were about couples. A loss of a lifelong partner, I want to see my best friend every day. I remember a story of a young man (in his twenties). He was advocated by his girlfriend to go up and share his story. She didn&#x27;t talk but her body language was very convincing taking his hand waving it up in the air, smiling, looking directly at the host. He was very shy, and the host decided that it was not that she was pushing him to do something he didn&#x27;t wanted, but that she was in some way representing him, and that shy people should also get their chance of telling their story. It took a while to understand his story, but in a nutshell her parents invited them (for dinner?) , and his parents did not. He couldn&#x27;t answer some of the questions (such as what did they do at her parents house), so the host and him stood up hand in hand walked to his partner and she somehow helped him to feel good again (I think she said it was dinner, but they had this connection that was more than that). We played-back the story on stage (improvised play) in which they meet at work as they do every day, and then he talks with his parents over the phone and they invite them over for dinner. I can&#x27;t describe the joy on his face. He no longer looked down, he was so happy. We were so happy! After the show, we met with one of their instructors and he explained to us that they rarely if ever get a chance to tell their story to someone that would actually listen, not to mention see their story on stage. After the show ended I went outside of the building to take a taxi and I felt in an instant how the war depression is weighting on me again (I&#x27;m from Tel Aviv/Israel everyone is depressed from the endless blood cycle). And then it hit me, that for the first time in a month, I was in a room with people that weren&#x27;t depressed by the war.

Is your complaint about strong typing here that you&#x27;d be forced to define stuff like a record Customer with fields &quot;lastName&quot;, &quot;firstName&quot;, etc. and you&#x27;d rather avoid that?<p>If you&#x27;d like something more &quot;dynamic&quot; (i.e. type-unsafe), you can instead just define a &quot;universal data type&quot; for all your CRUD data. For example you could define, say<p><pre><code>   data Any = Number Int\n            | Str String\n            | Map String Any\n            | Date ...\n            | ...\n</code></pre>\nand where you want &quot;universal&quot; data manipulation you just use Any.<p>EDIT: Thus you&#x27;ve confined all the &quot;fuzziness&quot; of your data definitions to a &quot;subsystem&quot; of your system and you can still benefit from proper types and type checking everywhere else.",1406967179
