8132359,comment,8131599,8131599,9,0,preinheimer,,,"I worked as a contract cable installer back when cable internet was new. New enough that they used one guy to do the computer set up, and a second to do the cable wiring. As I was finishing my tenure they were switching over to &quot;super techs&quot; who would do both. I was the computer half. This was like 2000.<p>We had no interaction with the guys doing the cabling, they were a different company. I&#x27;d get a sheet of installs in the morning, as well as the time frames. 8-12, 12-5, and 8-5. If someone had managed to convince a rep we might see a shorter timeframe like 3-5, but they were pretty rare. I&#x27;d show up, slot a network card, plug in the cable modem if the cable guy had been there already, and leave.<p>Then I moved to the big city, where the company gave people specific times. 10, 11, 12, 1. etc. They tended to give the clustered appointments to the super techs, so I was driving all over the city, searching for parking, and waiting to get buzzed in. My first two weeks were rough, then I discovered the manager had been going light on my appointments while I learned the city. Then my appointment book started looking more like: 10, 10, 11, 12, 12, 12, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4. On good days I&#x27;d hit the closest double/triple/quadruple booked slot early, hit the second one one time, and try to race to the rest. Skipping lunch as required, or snacking on a nutrigran bar while wishing my car had A/C. On harder days I&#x27;d get to the first appointment barely on time, discover they had Windows NT and try to pawn off appointments while juggling IRQ settings.<p>Some days were an absolute mess, 8,8,8,12,12,12,12,5,5,5,5,5 or the like. You couldn&#x27;t show up early for a 5, those folks were racing home to meet you as is. So I&#x27;d end up sitting in a park trying not to kill myself on a razor scooter for a few hours waiting for the next rush.",1407167972

It eventually shut down due to problems with vandalism and in the meantime sv.wikipedia had grown larger. I suspect a lot of articles were migrated to wiki from susning, or at the very least the community did.

8132350,comment,8131667,8132183,6,0,_delirium,,,"> Because most people can&#x27;t read English.<p>That&#x27;s a good argument for some languages, but for Swedish in particular it&#x27;s less strong, because the number of people who can read Swedish but not read English is fairly small, and rapidly declining. That doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no point to a Swedish Wikipedia, but whatever point there is can&#x27;t really be because Swedes are unable to read English.<p>That&#x27;s also true of Danish, which is one reason I believe the Danish Wikipedia has been languishing. There are many Danish people who are Wikipedians, but many of them do more English editing than Danish editing. The Swedish Wikipedia seems to be more active in comparison. It would be interesting to understand why; is it just the population difference (9.5m vs. 5.5m)?",1407167884

If it&#x27;s gotten this far in the conversation (posting on HN) then the situation is clearly bad, at least on one end.  Given it&#x27;s a situation with unfair dilution, the assumption is that all stakeholders are well aware of the dilution results and are OK with what is being proposed.  They are founders, after all, and SHOULD know what they mean by asking for this.  Also, don&#x27;t think for a minute they don&#x27;t already have attorneys queued up on their end.<p>I would say this is EXACTLY the time to have an attorney get involved to take a look at the documentation and render an opinion.  If the situation is ugly, they may fire him if he protests, but that also gives rise to a reason to question the cause for termination.  Given the contractual agreement between the parties, a termination event may provide an avenue to compensation for unfair termination, especially when seeking legal council could be shown as the reason for termination.<p>When in doubt, lawyer up and be cautious of making blaming statements that aggravate the other party.

At each funding round the company can issue a new, higher priority of shares, and even let previous participants who buy into the new round get their existing shares upgraded to the new priority.  You can be sitting on your X% shares (whatever X ends up being) and find out when your company is sold that you&#x27;re getting $0 because there was no money left after servicing the priority shares.  This effect can be greatly magnified if some of the money was paid in with an <i>interest</i> clause, with that value also taking priority over your own share of the company.\nYou&#x27;re remote, and you&#x27;re a code monkey.

If you (sensibly) do not agree that the iPhone failed to change the underlying demand for cell phone applications, consider the possibility that we are, in fact, crushingly undersupplied for B2C software.  This would counsel people buying positive expected value lottery tickets as soon as the startup founders can print them.<p>What&#x27;s in it for a founder when you could go get a job at Amagoobooksoft instead?  That&#x27;s a fair question.  One: you will not have to work at Amagoobooksoft for a little while.  Two: you may improve your eventual position at Amagoobooksoft by doing a startup versus simply applying to them today.  Three: you may invent the next WhatsApp, and end up with several billion dollars in your pocket.  Four: for a certain psychograph of developer, there are non-pecuniary advantages to running a startup in a manner similar to their being non-pecuniary advantages to doing the Peace Corps for some people.  (&quot;Change the world!&quot;)  Five: You may, accurately or not, perceive that you are presently not likely to receive an offer at Amagoobooksoft, but accurately perceive that &quot;Nobody can tell me I&#x27;m not ready to do a startup&quot; and rationally calculate that this is a better way to build skills and reputational capital than e.g. getting a job at Burger King even if the money is roughly similar.<p>P.S.

Cuba was Spanish military base for hundred of years, do you think they mad enough to take it back on a such false premise?<p>>The residents of the city have in 20+ years never been allowed to have democratic elections of the mayor, because all Ukrainian governments felt that they would elect pro-Russian mayor. Instead, for 20+ years, they got mayors appointed from Kiev, some anti-Russian.<p>So, in your beloved Russia, governors was not elected for 10 years, so you will blame Putin?<p>> Crimea has de facto not been under the coup government control even before the Russian actions and was lost by Ukraine before it was gained by Russia.<p>You&#x27;re wrong again.

8132058,comment,8129454,8129927,1,0,Jedd,,,"> I think the US is a good example since most pharmaceutical R&D is done in the US. Also, the NIH has a pretty beefy budget. For other countries, the cost of running their on pharma companies would be much more burdensome.<p>Much R&D may be billed back to the US, or at least billed in USD, but I&#x27;d suggest it&#x27;s been quite some years since even a sizeable minority of <i>actual</i> R&D work has been done within the borders of the US.<p>Quoting Ben Goldacre in &quot;Bad Pharma&quot; (2012)<p>&quot;In the past, only 15 per cent of clinical trials were conducted outside the USA. Now it’s more than half. The average rate of growth in the number of trials in India is 20 per cent a year, in China 47 per cent, in Argentina 27 per cent, and so on, simply because they are better at attracting CRO business, at lower cost. At the same time, trials in the US are falling by 6 per cent a year (and in the UK by 10 per cent a year).  As a result of these trends, many trials are now being conducted in developing countries, where regulatory oversight is poorer, as is the normal standard of clinical care.&quot;<p>* CRO = Clinical Research Organisation.  Precisely as disarmingly harmless as it sounds.<p>> To answer your first point, you&#x27;re saying that the cost of R&D would still be born by the end-user (patient). What&#x27;s the benefit then if it&#x27;s not saving money?<p>I wasn&#x27;t suggesting that money won&#x27;t be saved.<p>To the contrary - the cost of R&D is a relatively small component of the current pharma mechanism.  Once you eradicate the need to (expensively) mislead and befuddle regulators, medicos, patients, there&#x27;s a lot more to spend on actual R&D.<p>> If you think a gov&#x27;t run company would not pull some of the same stuff the private ones do, I&#x27;d have you take a look at some of the corruption that goes on at public companies. A gov&#x27;t run company might not be for-profit, but someone there has budgets and revenue numbers to meet. The motive to cut corners doesn&#x27;t disappear when it&#x27;s run by the gov&#x27;t.<p>Rest assured my idealistic interpretation of this impossible world precludes this kind of corruption.  :)<p>>  And why shouldn&#x27;t a pharma company have a sales and marketing budget? Do you think your doctor has time to sit down and analyze all of the clinical trial data? Getting in front of a doctor and touting the benefits of your drug sounds like a good thing to me. Sure, some sales reps use slimy tactics, but overall educating physicians doesn&#x27;t sound like a bad thing.<p>Oh my.   I&#x27;d strongly recommend you spend a few hours to read through Goldacre, B.&#x27;s book (ref above).   The idea that the pharma industry is &#x27;helping&#x27; doctors in their on-going education is ... worrisome, at best.<p>(Hint: overall .. it&#x27;s a horrendously bad arrangement for <i>everyone</i> involved apart from the shareholders in the relevant big pharma org)",1407165127

Option pool should not be created by &quot;taking&quot; options from employees, but rather by issuing new shares which dilutes everyone equally. You should bring it up and ask that they create the option pool by issuing new shares which will at least indicate to them that you know what you&#x27;re talking about and perhaps reduce their inclination to screw you.<p>Also, what was your vesting schedule? If it was four years, you should have already vested 3.75%, which you can exercise anytime. If they take 4% of the remaining, you&#x27;re left with just 2.25% to vest over next 2.5 years, which is just wrong.<p>Also: before you begin negotiation, do understand your BATNA - Best alternate to a negotiated agreement.

Here&#x27;s my response to that[1] as well. But now that I&#x27;m rereading my response it doesn&#x27;t seem clear what I mean. The README for the language demonstrates how you can use shell grouping as a poor man&#x27;s module system. When you do that, you have to use &#x27;cat&#x27; on single files in certain situations. So I stuck with &#x27;cat&#x27; for the simple example so it&#x27;s consistent with the more complex examples. If you take a look at the typo script[2] that wraps the compiler, you&#x27;ll see that I know when to use redirects and when to use &#x27;cat&#x27;.
