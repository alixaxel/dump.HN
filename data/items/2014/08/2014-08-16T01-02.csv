This API has a name, but it is for debugging purposes only: the lifetime and accessibility of the object is based purely on the Unix semantics of memory maps and file descriptors (which can be laterally shared using Unix domain sockets), allowing them to be automatically cleaned up. There is an additional advantage that it works without extra mount points, but I doubt that would have been a sufficient motivation for this change: /dev/shm is so problematic that it doesn&#x27;t even exist on Android.",1408153555

One of the difficult parts to fit into an algorithm cleanly is &quot;pick how many shifts this employee should have&quot; - e.g. should a part-time employee have two 8-hour + one 4-hour shifts, or one 8-hour +  three 4-hour shifts. If you are trying to build that logic into the solver then branch and bound struggles but something like basin hopping seems to work better. However, with fewer employees you can just solve all possible weekly shifts per employee in parallel with a branch and bound. The most basic way to calculate the range is using the hours an employee works in a week and dividing it by both the minimum shift length (&quot;not worth coming in for a shift of less than two hours&quot;) and max shift length (&quot;don&#x27;t have somebody work for more than 8 hours in a day&quot;).
