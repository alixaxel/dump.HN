8202272,comment,8201366,8202176,2,0,quarterwave,,,"Very good question. Here&#x27;s the gist of it, a rough way of thinking about it.<p>A time varying electromagnetic field is produced by moving charges (except for a minor distinction about steady currents). The direction of motion of the charges determines the polarization of the emitted field. Later on, when the field encounters matter it produces an identical motion of charges i.e; if originally an East-West charge motion produced a North-South field then a N-S field will induce an E-W motion among new charges which in turn re-emit N-S light. The original light and the re-emitted light interfere, the delay is what slows the light down, as noted by others. But you can see why the direction is the same.<p>Note: I suppose this picture is somehow tied to reciprocity of the Maxwell equations between sources and fields, I need to go look it up again.",1408542520

Imagine a thick piece of glass being traversed by a light beam: most of the photons will traverse it undisturbed (and thus maintain their original direction), but a few will be scattered all around (and that&#x27;s the light you can see if you watch &quot;inside&quot; the glass from one of its sides).\nOn the other hand, depending on the light frequency and the crystalline structure of the material, photons can be scattered by the whole lattice itself, rather than by the single atoms/molecules. In this case, the direction follows the &quot;rule of the mirror&quot;, which is dictated by quantum mechanics.",1408542471

As long as there is no 3D printer, which can build nano structures to makes chips, I can only implement it into a FPGA. The main FPGA providers are either Altera or Xilinx and both a very expansive. So they are good for prototyping or very low volume. But for anything beyond, I need a specific implementation.\nOkay, I could go to a foundry like Samsung (or other) and order according to my design. But, even that requires a very high volume in the millions to make it affordable and viable from a business perspective. Especially, if it is intended for the IoT market.\nOn the other side, I can buy ARM Cortex M0 and Cortex M1 for cheap from NXP and other for less than $1. They are power full and power consumption is very low.<p>Just to mention, the other day the WRTnode[1] was released for less den $25 or look at an Raspberry PI Compute. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Yes, I would like to see those with an open source chip.

8202174,comment,8201256,8202042,3,0,igravious,,,"Perhaps because the &quot;model&quot; we have in the West of ourselves is more-or-less a dualistic model: mind/body. I guess that people in the West consider yoga involving poses to target the body and practices like meditation to target the mind. That would then cover &quot;everything&quot; as far as we&#x27;d see.<p>There is the notion embedded in Western culture that the seat of consciousness (which many equate with the self) is contained within the Mind somewhere. We have a mostly pop cultural understanding of the mind with a good dash of Freud-speak. I think that experimental psychology and neuroscience are increasingly important as sources of understanding for the mind.<p>In the West, also, I figure that wisdom is pursued through religion or the arts/literature/cinema/etc. or philosophy.<p>I think that most in the West see energy as part of the scientific domain of things. I realise that many don&#x27;t but I&#x27;m going to discount this group as pre-scientific and/or not scientifically literate and/or superstitious.<p>I guess what you mean by Bliss is what the Buddhists mean by Elightenment? I can&#x27;t think of a direct analog for this state in Western culture. If you could tell me more I&#x27;d answer this better.<p>Short answer. Western culture and science is resistant to the model you are putting forward. That&#x27;s why. Be happy to debate any of this further.",1408540513
