Repetitive trance? No thank you. I&#x27;ll keep my Jazz, my electro-swing, noise music, experimental stuff, black metal, and the like. And Igorrr. I&#x27;ll definitely keep him. I rather like to be surprised and when things are artfully &#x27;off&#x27; but still manage to come together.<p>Perhaps this is simply you not liking it. And that&#x27;s fine, go back to the mainstream stuff and I&#x27;ll support the others.",1407668379
8159419,comment,8158510,8158510,6,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>Frty-one million IQ points. That’s what Dr. David Bellinger determined Americans have collectively forfeited as a result of exposure to lead, mercury, and organophosphate pesticides. &quot;</i><p>Okay, I bailed. It&#x27;s rare that a lede is so bad that I&#x27;ll bail -- usually I just don&#x27;t click on stuff that looks like crap. But this looked interesting.<p>Why did I bail? First, IQ points are not cumulative. It&#x27;s not like you can add them all up and get anything at all useful. It&#x27;s not even like we could come to a reasonable agreement that IQ points are a useful metric, but I&#x27;ll just let that go.<p>More to the point, the question isn&#x27;t society overall, it&#x27;s individual choice. Would you trade the loss of 2 or 3 IQ points for better food, a modern world, access to transportation, and so on? I would -- in a heartbeat. It wouldn&#x27;t even be a tough decision to make. Live to 80 in a modern world full of modern conveniences while being a tiny bit less bright? Count me in.<p>So I went into scan mode for the rest of the article. For all I know, it looked good. But I&#x27;m left believing what I already believe: Yes, there probably are some statistical clusters that warrant societal intervention. Perhaps poor people living in a lead-infested housing project next to a chemical factory. But to use terms like &quot;Silent Pandemic&quot; is to be terribly irresponsible. Alarmist even. It does not describe the problem in enough detail for the reader to know what to do about it, and it&#x27;s just a cry for attention.<p>Sorry. No so much.",1407668363

8159411,comment,8157684,8159175,3,0,simonh,,,"My take is exactly the opposite. When I was a CS student in the late 80s it was extremely hard to get access to high quality development tools beyond. Yes MS-DOS came with QBASIC, but if you wanted to program in anything more capable such as C or Pascal you were out of luck. Nowadays the highest quality dev tools for any platform are just a free download away. Python, C#, Java, Go, pretty much whatever you want. Eve better, many popular games such as WoW and Minecraft either come with built-in scripting or easily accessible extension and scripting tools. Squeak is awesome and soon you&#x27;ll be able to program in it without even downloading anything thanks to the HTML5 client.<p>Linux generally comes with a whole ton of dev tools by default, and the Mac is close on it&#x27;s heels and even has Applescript built in to the GUI layer. There has never been an easier time to get into programming.",1407668078

In that case you might be lucky and have a person like krat0sprakhar nicely visualizing your specific problem.<p>And just my two cents: most problems I encounter are integration (full Bayesian) and the detection of extremes (MAP). There is nothing random about these problems either, maybe even less than pi (which might be &quot;normal&quot;, nobody knows yet)!<p>I&#x27;d be happy to see a visualization of another nice, simple problem, that is more up your alley!",1407664988
