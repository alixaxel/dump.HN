I was in Montessori for a short enough time that I didn&#x27;t feel too weird during the switch (although I distinctly remember wondering why Kindergarten was so easy compared to preschool), but long enough that I was way ahead of most of the other kindergarteners. Then in the following years I was put into various accelerated learning groups with the other smart kids. Once you&#x27;re in that group it&#x27;s pretty easy to get a good education, even in public school (that or I got lucky with good public school teachers).",1408341525

Normal school allows children just long enough to become absorbed in something, then interrupts them with &quot;change class!&quot;.
