Assange (rightly or wrongly) believed strongly that the chances of Sweden doing such an extradition were more likely than the UK doing something similar. There is a lot of stuff about the rape charges that is fairly suspicious, I&#x27;m not sure if the risk of extradition today is as large as it was back when this all went down and maybe that figures into Assange&#x27;s decision to exit the embassy now.<p>If he goes to Sweden (which I would consider highly likely if he in fact does exit the embassy and gets apprehended by the UK authorities) I suspect the chances of him doing any significant jail time as a result of the case there are slim, so then the only thing that he should still be worried about is eventual extradition to the US on charges still to be brought, but the spotlight will be very much on Sweden pulling any fast ones in the extradition process there.<p>Time will tell.",1408355349

Hit man was simply that, everyone put their name in the hat and five bucks. Only rules were, you could not shoot someone in uniform or at work. Take the target name from your hit.<p>Lots of hilarity and some good bruises but those were mostly remedied by disallowing freezing the paint balls. Some really unsettling conversations with local and base police, paint ball guns can look like a gun in the dark and if you alter their color it can lead to problems.

The biggest problem is that many investors see it as a red flag if a person who is not involved with the day-to-day running of the startup holds significant equity.  Equity seems cheap when the company is worth nothing, but it will be near and dear when you are seeking investment, when you have dozens of employees who would go to Google if it weren&#x27;t for their stock options, when you and your cofounder are deep in the trenches and want to quit, or when you&#x27;re trying to hire an executive.  And if he holds a significant fraction of voting shares, you may need to consult him when you do something significant like sell the company or issue new shares, and if he&#x27;s no longer involved with the company that can introduce delays when you can least afford them.<p>Also, typically marketing a product in the early stages involves making really significant changes to the product itself.

The interface is ridiculously easy and UI turned out pretty nicely.<p>I have this idea that I wouldn&#x27;t mind floating. give away equity in whatever the app is worth eventually to the person (marketeer) who can get the app to a million downloads(or some number). The way I see it, our strong point is design and dev. And an app that&#x27;s worth nothing is, well... nothing.
