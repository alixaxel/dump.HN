It&#x27;s an idea that scales: true for any person (=how much authority you are delegated) and even firms & countries (=more trust=>more teamwork, reciprocicated specialization, and openness to new ideas). The downside, is that empirically the world bifurcates into those who build trust...and those who betray it for opportunistic advantage. Empathy, thus needs to be put in context. It can be used constructively, but (false) empathy is also the halmark of a psychopath. So on that front, <i>caveat emptor</i>. Or as once was put: trust, but verify.

More than likely, the bank will look at your credit rating and offer something lower.  Even if they don&#x27;t, that&#x27;s half of what the video is showing.<p>Likewise, a 4% return on investments seems unreasonable.  The same bank with the 3% mortgage is offering a non-cashable GIC (which seems to be the Canadian version of a CD) which pays 2.3%.  That&#x27;s only a little better than half of what&#x27;s shown in the video.<p>As for housing prices, it&#x27;s very hard to find identical houses available for rent and for buying, but here&#x27;s what I found:<p>For rent, a 3 bedroom, 1.5 bathroom, 1100 sq ft townhouse for $1500/mo.  For buying, a 3 bedroom, 2 bathroom, 926 sq ft townhouse in the same area of the city for $225K.  It&#x27;s not apples to apples by any means.  The one for purchase is smaller, plus it&#x27;s a condo so there will be additional fees on top of the regular things you&#x27;d pay for in an owned house.  In spite of the differences, $3K of rent does not equal a $1M house in my part of the world.<p>I plugged the numbers into the New York Times rent vs buy calculator that was mentioned elsewhere (<a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calcula...</a>).  With these two properties, with these interest rates on the mortgage and investment, with local taxes and utility costs applied, buying is better after three years.<p>That said, it might not be all about cost.  If you like to move around a lot, maybe renting is better because not renewing your lease is easier than selling a house.  Maybe renting is better because you don&#x27;t have the savings for a downpayment or don&#x27;t qualify for a mortgage.  Maybe buying is better because you like to do the handyman type of stuff and rarely move.<p>There&#x27;s all kinds of reasons that renting or buying can be better, which is why I don&#x27;t buy blanket statements that say &quot;renting is always better&quot; or &quot;buying is always better&quot;.",1390150120

But she goes too far in attributing responsibility to the idea that we should be doing what we love.<p>She shows her sympathy for this idea at the very end:<p><i>If we acknowledged all of our work as work, we could set appropriate limits for it, demanding fair compensation and humane schedules that allow for family and leisure time. ...

But I think she misidentifies what has led to problems she describes and in doing so has underestimated the challenge.  The main culprits for all of the very-low-end jobs are as likely to be automation, globalization, and a lack of regulation of large corporations and the financial services industry.

It was so obviously a &quot;bubble buy&quot; that even before things started to get bad, it was visible from a mile away that he was making a bad decision:  He was buying a new construction K. Hov. cookie-cutter apartment in Edgewater, NJ, which was just close enough to Manhattan to tempt those &quot;I&#x27;m buying a NYC apartment!&quot; types but just far enough away that there wasn&#x27;t a real fundamental demand to live there. He got a terrible no-verification mortgage (&quot;liar loan&quot;) that we all warned him was trouble. He paid way too much -- something like $600k for a 1BR condo (near Manhattan prices, not Edgewater NJ prices).<p>When our friends warned him of these issues, when we pointed out that he could rent a very nice 2BR apartment a few blocks away for $2500/month that he and his wife would be plenty comfortable in, when we pointed out he was likely buying at or near the peak of a heady real estate market, he didn&#x27;t care. His only refrain - over and over - was the age-old:<p>&quot;But I&#x27;m going to be a _homeowner_.  You guys are just throwing away money towards rent every month. I don&#x27;t want to do that.&quot;<p>Fast forward a few years:  Not surprisingly, his interest rate reset, his apartment is worth about $400k, and he had to go through mortgage default to get a modification on his loan.<p>And yet he still clings to his decision - &quot;yeah but I own my place, and it&#x27;ll even out over the next few years.&quot;<p>Sometimes buying for the sake of buying just isn&#x27;t the right decision, despite what &quot;we were all taught.&quot;",1390149854

For the author, it looks like that latter -- he&#x27;s exhausted because he has to consciously re-process his perceptions of others, perceptions which his internal ToM has already processed but has output conclusions that he might not consider acceptable (which implies a mismatch between the two ToMs).<p>What he&#x27;s suggesting as a solution, in my opinion, is an attempt to suppress the symptoms, when the problem is the ToM. The correct way -- or at least the way that worked for me -- is to learn to see other human beings as different versions of myself, with different experiences and neurological makeup. In order to understand a person&#x27;s behavior, especially negative behavior, I try to first imagine a situation where <i>I</i> would behave in a similar manner (e.g. the boss just yelled at me; I could conclude he is an asshole, or I could try to imagine a situation where I have yelled at someone in my team). Then I try to remember my state of mind from a similar past situation. Then I imagine the other person being under the influence of those same emotions. Suddenly it is easier to understand the person&#x27;s behavior (but not <i>justify</i> it).

7084796,comment,7084314,7084623,5,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"It&#x27;s not a myth. It&#x27;s mathematics. We have a winner take all voting system (&quot;first past the post&quot;) which means a vote (or ten thousand votes) for a third party who doesn&#x27;t win is exactly the same mathematically as that number of votes going to the major party candidate <i>least like</i> the third party candidate, because that candidate&#x27;s strongest opponent is the one who would have had those votes in the alternative, and the winner is defined as the candidate with more votes than the candidate than the second most votes. The candidate with the third most votes is totally irrelevant until they cease to be the candidate with the third most votes. And they can&#x27;t do that, because the incentives don&#x27;t work -- if a candidate from e.g. the Green party could actually win an election, the Democrats would just run that candidate on their ticket, and likewise with the Libertarians and the Republicans. Because running two viable candidates who agree on 80% of the issues against a candidate from the other major party is friendly fire -- if you have a district with 60% left-leaning voters and you run a viable Green candidate against a Democrat and a Republican, the two left-leaning candidates split the left-leaning vote and give the win to the Republican. Viable would-be third party candidates are well aware of this, which is why there are no viable third party candidates -- they have an overwhelming incentive to join a major party as soon as they achieve viability.<p>This is <i>not</i> an insurmountable problem, you&#x27;re just solving it in the wrong place. If you want a &quot;third party&quot; candidate to win then what you need is for that candidate to win a major party&#x27;s primary. What is necessary is for people to stop voting for parties whatsoever and vote for candidates instead.",1390147716

I think his point was that IF the house went for $750K, you could reasonably expect rent to be around $3K. That seems right to me-- a 1BR in SF sells and rents for about those prices.<p>As for having 250K in the bank-- if the house costs $1M, you have to make a down payment. In the mid-2000s, that may have been a smaller percentage, but these days I think 15-20% down is not unheard of.",1390147705

Although property costs may vary two orders of magnitude or more, a firefighter gets paid &quot;about&quot; the same everywhere, ditto a new police car costs about constant, etc.  So I would guess someone living where an acre costs about $200K would pay about 2.6%.<p>I would imagine in Detroit you could buy 50 houses for $100K but have to pay $100K/yr prop tax on them if the surface area adds up to enough acres.<p>The only utility bill I paid in my apartment was electric and it averaged about $10 over the course of a year.
