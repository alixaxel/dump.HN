7048631,comment,7044690,7047203,1,0,muhuk,,,"I made a similar decision, also almost a year ago.<p>I should mention that I had moved to another country 3 years ago. The first year I was very social. It was fun and satisfying. But then I started to realize there was a fundamental philosophical difference between me and pretty much everyone else. It&#x27;s hard to explain objectively. But my observation is `truth is less important than peace and order`. It took me some time to formulate this because I was giving the benefit of doubt to my friends and only responding to what they were actually saying. But when truth is no longer the goal, pretty much anything goes. The second year went by with these awkward conversations.<p>Then I started to question the value of my friendships. Of course it was the value I was getting at first. But that line of thinking wasn&#x27;t very useful from a practical perspective. It dawned on me when I started looking at the equation from the other side. What I had to offer wasn&#x27;t valuable for them. Not only that, it was confusing and sometimes hurtful. It&#x27;s like you get to paint the world any color you want, then someone comes tells you that the sun shouldn&#x27;t be green. Of course this was all in my head, it had to be tested.<p>If you are a valuable friend to me, if you contribute something worthy to my life, I thought, I would at least care if you are dead or not. That was my thesis. So I disconnected from the `cheap communication` channels but kept my phone and of course my email. And that&#x27;s pretty much the whole story. No one called. Except a few friends that I didn&#x27;t have doubts about, but I have always been in contact with them, facebook or no facebook.<p>I sometimes feel lonely. But I will not lower my expectations. Because that would mean asking me to stop saying the world revolves around sun, or that it&#x27;s not flat. I don&#x27;t want to pretend everybody is right `in their own way`, no matter how stupid the stuff coming out of their mouth. That would make me unhappy. Now, at least I can be happy.<p>I agree with you in that independence is valuable trait. Much of the advice is focusing on the offense, meet more people, be more nice. I think independence and self-esteem are better starting points. I would say; work on yourself. If you are bettering yourself, you wouldn&#x27;t have too much time to feel lonely. Eventually you might meet new people and maybe make some friends. But I think the key is to build yourself up.",1389581923

7048629,comment,7048320,7048572,3,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>&quot;(And for that matter, if students in my Ph.D. program want to enroll in courses in business, writing, or anything else, they can.)&quot;</i><p>Do they have the time?<p>My undergrad program was extremely... focused (a word the administration would no doubt use to describe it). In my entire 4.5 years I had exactly two non-engineering electives, the rest of the schedule was a full stack of &quot;core&quot; courses. This was not atypical at my school.<p>The result of which is that you create a bunch of people who are very narrowly educated. I dodged that bullet with a combination of suicidal course loads (e.g., taking a 7th course in a 6-core-course semester) and class-skipping. Neither were good solutions and I only made it out by the skin of my teeth.<p>The problem here is that the definition of a Ph.D. for you is <i>extremely</i> different from the definition of Ph.D. for most of your students. I think there&#x27;s next to no one whose primary objective with a Ph.D. is to produce a piece of original research - it is always a means to another end: usually career-oriented.<p>There is a dramatic misalignment of what you think you&#x27;re doing there and what your students think they&#x27;re doing there.",1389581914

Even if you use something like Tern, it&#x27;s still really bad.<p>You can pass arbitrary arguments to functions. Types and arity isn&#x27;t checked. Optional positional/named arguments (with default values) don&#x27;t exist. Passing some options object and &quot;foo = foo || 5&quot; is the best you can do. You can&#x27;t tell, with absolute certainty, that some object doesn&#x27;t have some particular property. A <i>string</i> might have a &quot;lenght&quot; property (should have been &quot;length&quot;, that was a typo).<p>Your IDE can make some educated guesses and offer some auto-complete suggestions based on that.<p>There is also type coercion. Maybe you really wanted to create NaN in a very elaborate manner. Multiplying some array with some object is totally legit. No squiggly line for that.<p>That&#x27;s a far cry from being perfect.<p>Never used something like C# or Java? Dart&#x27;s tooling is also pretty good, for example.

7048525,comment,7048320,7048320,9,0,HarryHirsch,,,"This is a weak piece, it overlooks many things.<p>First, there seems to be the idea that a PhD&#x27;s place is in academia.  Where is this idea even coming from?  Back in a different time I got a degree in chemistry in Germany, and the idea was that you would sign up with one if the chemical companies.  The degree program was very thorough and broad and lasted five years, and you would start work, be given a mentor, and do anything chemical.  Your degree equipped you to do that, it was very broad, if it was chemistry you had heard of it.  A PhD was required, chemical technicians would be trained on the job.  The lesson here is that a broad degree makes you more employable, but you cannot sell this idea when students have to raise their own funds to pay for their degree and when state and federal funding lines for universities keep shrinking.<p>But what happened was several things: the great monoliths that in Germany had a standing like Microsoft or Google were broken up and sold off (except the BASF), and the perennial pharmco crisis started.<p>There is another lesson, I think: deep science requires deep pockets that only a large, established company can provide. Startups are no solution: it seems that the big pharmcos are now turning into brokers that acquire startups, in-house projects aren&#x27;t done any longer, instead you acquire a startup, and testing is contracted out abroad.  Another problem: no one cooks up their own compounds any longer, you contract out to a Chinese contract shop that employs PhDs from China.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is cheaper or better (there is something to be said for short communication lines - just walk up a floor), but it is current practice.<p>Also: at my second-tier state school the quality of applicants started really going up after 2009, when the crisis had settled in.  To me this means that private jobs have disappeared, and universities aren&#x27;t hiring much either.<p>This is an economic problem, and I really can&#x27;t see how turning universities into trade schools could be helpful to create jobs.  Neither do I see how increased reliance on privately-funded research institutes would help - no matter how big their endowment they would still be competing for external funding, the biggest source of which is the NIH.  But the NIH keeps getting its funding cut.<p>There&#x27;s the other problem: the government isn&#x27;t funding science as much as it ought to.",1389580126

7048513,comment,7048169,7048471,2,0,URSpider94,,,"One answer is that there is a philosophy that fees or taxes should only be levied on people who use them. Automobile ownership is a discretionary act that is already highly subsidized, so the government feels justified in levying specific fees against car owners.<p>Another answer is that user fees are politically expedient, as you point out -- it&#x27;s a way to increase government revenue without increasing taxes per se.<p>In any case, if you buy a car, the DMV fees ARE generally rolled into the purchase, though as a separate item. Not to be too pedantic, but you can always buy a vehicle and not register it -- for example, if you are from out of state and plan to register it in your home state, or if you need to do some work on it before you put it on the road.",1389579898

Only the existence of an account would have to be. Not even a &quot;reference&quot; to the content mentioned later in solutions. Such service doesn&#x27;t have to care if the user stores pictures on a service - just the access rights of potential pictures.<p>- &quot;This allows central access for intelligence agencies to know what I&#x27;m doing online&quot; - they already know. This is neither making it worse nor better. The problem is that it would make scamming much easier and any password leak much more dangerous.<p>- &quot;This would have to be a really popular opt-in for companies to maintain, or it would have to be the law.&quot; - I have to disagree again about the first part. The law is not possible, anyway. (which country&#x27;s law? who does it apply to? who would be able to enforce it?) It doesn&#x27;t require being popular, it needs an incentive why anyone would want to integrate - i.e. what does the provider get from it. If they don&#x27;t get anything, there will be no interest. Integrating such service is probably more costly than doing it in-house.<p>So summing it up... I think such service would be actually bad for almost everyone really.

That being said I use an Accel Active DP 1.1 -> HDMI 1.4 adapter which makes it work just fine even on older version of mac os X. Actually with that adapter you can use a lot of even much older macs to drive the seiki or any other 4k 30hz display.<p>The adapter:\n<a href""http://www.amazon.com/Accell-B086B-008B-UltraAV-DisplayPort-Adapter/dp/B00ESFEUSG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389578834&sr=8-1&keywords=accell+hdmi+1."" rel""nofollo"">http://www.amazon.com/Accell-B086B-008B-UltraAV-DisplayPort-...</a>",1389578892
