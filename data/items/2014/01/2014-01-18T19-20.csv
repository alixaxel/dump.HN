I don&#x27;t think students are necessarily in the wrong -- most are probably in college to get a job, and they&#x27;re right to resent the stranglehold that universities have on social prestige and career respectability.

Plus, it produces a sort of customer mentality, where you&#x27;re paying for service and &quot;the customer is always right&quot;. Things aren&#x27;t perfect here either, but Danish university students tend not to have the same weird adversarial relationship with higher education. I would guess the fact that they don&#x27;t pay anything, but in fact get paid to attend, helps a bit. In a sense they&#x27;re employees rather than customers (albeit at a junior apprenticeship level of employment), and the state, which wants an educated populace, is the customer.",1390075173
7082022,comment,7081370,7081370,1,0,javajosh,,,"Part of me feels for security forces. The world is this largely dark swirl of billions of people doing &quot;stuff&quot;, and although statistically insignificant, some of that stuff is designed to do evil, e.g. blow up a building to make some sort of statement. So doesn&#x27;t it make sense to shine a light into the darkness?<p>I&#x27;m not sure if people notice this, but the police are fundamentally reactive - in general a cop isn&#x27;t there when you get mugged. The risk of getting caught is the value police give you in that moment. This puts the police in a bad position to do what it is Joe Q Public seems to want them to do: <i>prevent crime</i> like school shootings, bombings, and hijacking of airplanes - even when the perpetrator is suicidal and acting alone, or suicidal and highly secretive.<p>The irony is in their quest to prevent crime, rather than just react to it, cops are deploying tools that examine everyone: because <i>everyone is a legitimate suspect for crimes that haven&#x27;t been committed yet.</i> They don&#x27;t know you or me - they only know that somewhere out there is someone plotting some bad stuff, and they want to figure out who it is.<p>In a way, it&#x27;s a natural progression of Bush&#x27;s preemptive war doctrine: don&#x27;t wait for them to hit you, because the imagined pain of that is too awful: hit them first. In a very serious way it is much like the attempt at Pre-Crime in the movie <i>Minority Report</i>.<p>The great irony is that, in many cases, these tools are alienating the same population that they are trying to protect, and I would argue, destroying what is the absolute best &quot;tool&quot; for crime prevention: people with their eyes open.<p>Let me put it this way: it used to be that if I thought someone was building a bomb next door, I would call the cops. I would call them because I would expect them to investigate fairly, respectfully, and that if there was nothing wrong then my neighbor would suffer nothing from the brief investigation. But honestly, I wouldn&#x27;t call the cops now, because I know how they, and in fact I, would be treated. God knows what sort of wringer they would put us through, innocent or not, trying to help or not.<p>One of the prices we will pay for these policies and tortured reading of the constitution and law is over-all reduced cooperation from the public.<p>And that&#x27;s too bad because there are no electronic tools that can stop the Adam Lanzas of the world. At best, we as citizens and family can at least do our best to identify risks, and take steps to reduce the risk - such as making sure they don&#x27;t have ready access to guns.<p>And, I would argue, that there are no electronic tools that can stop the Al Quedas of the world either. The urge to murder people you&#x27;ve never met for abstract reasons doesn&#x27;t pop up at random - it takes time, community, and I imagine there is escalation. So yes, deeply infiltrate violent (or even potentially violent) groups with human assets. This puts eyes on the ground, and a human sensibility where it is needed.<p>So yes, well done government, throwing away the best asset you had (the goodwill and trust of the people) and replacing it with crappy toys that don&#x27;t catch terrorists, but which do give the government unprecedented, asymmetrical power over ordinary people at scale.<p>Good heavens, when I say it like that it&#x27;s enough to make one doubt the good intentions of the government!",1390075110

7082005,comment,7081405,7081851,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Nice! You are correct of course, I did mis-understand your question. I suspect the minimax answer is Java. My reasoning for that is that enterprise shops both consume and turn over a lot of Java programmers, this is in part to consulting gigs with Salesforce, SAP, Oracle, or IBM.<p>Thanks for the clear response and your excellent example. It is interesting to see what it optimizes for. I don&#x27;t doubt you could stay employed &quot;forever&quot; at $45,000/year Java shop code monkey jobs for example. My personal conjecture is that Tech is not a &#x27;connected graph&#x27; in the sense that not all nodes are reachable from any node, and not all paths can be traveled in both directions.<p>The example I am most familiar with is &#x27;CEO taint&#x27; which is folks who get to a certain level, and then become CEOs of their own startup, where they reach a certain level of qualified success. Then, in a quest for finding their next engagement they are un-hirable because &#x27;former CEO&#x27; isn&#x27;t something you higher in to be a coder, and maybe not manager. Their only accessible nodes are &#x27;new startup&#x27; or &#x27;appointment as CEO to startup&#x27; or &#x27;consultant&#x27;. If you can&#x27;t get funding for a startup, and you don&#x27;t have enough street cred as a &#x27;consultant&#x27;, its a really sticky place to be. The other common one I&#x27;ve seen is people who &#x27;grew up&#x27; in a company, started right out of college and put in 10, 15, or 20 years, and then left as UberDistinguishedPrinciple Engineer/Scientist but were unable to find anyone who would hire them at a level and salary they could easily accept.

They conclude that the solution is to come up with ways to enhance their prestige even more, for example by writing articles like this one that talks about how great experts are. I&#x27;m afraid this will only poison relations between laymen and experts even more.<p>What I love about computer programming is that basically all you need to be an expert on something is time, persistence, and an Internet connection. Contrary to the author&#x27;s claims, the alternative to institutionalized expertise is not that &quot;Everyone is an expert&quot;. It&#x27;s that &quot;You don&#x27;t have to go to a prestigious university to become an expert&quot;. Sure, there are a lot of charlatans running around in the programming world, but the free exchange of knowledge and the absence of licensure has led to both a flowering of human creativity as well as (outside of San Francisco) non-resentful relationships between experts and laypeople.",1390074552

The first thing most people reach for first is that extensions shouldn&#x27;t auto-update. Personally, I disagree - I love silent auto-updates in general. It&#x27;s a huge drag on the computing experience to have dozens of different widgets all requiring manual updates, all with different mechanisms and all on their own schedules. If I had to pick the one most annoying thing about running Windows, that would be it. The biggest appeal to me of Chromebooks is silent auto-update of everything. Don&#x27;t bug me about updates, just make everything always run the latest, most feature-filled and bug-fixed versions.<p>I&#x27;d lean towards using a finer-grained permission model for extensions, and javascript in general. As far as I know, most extensions now can only request permissions to run arbitrary JS on every page you visit, and send arbitrary AJAX to any URL. Perhaps we could do a better job of locking that down. Have no such thing as a permission to AJAX any URL, but instead make AJAXing any particular TLD a new permission. Maybe we can also only allow access to DOM elements originating from particular domains. Then you could keep auto-update, but require a new user authorization for any new URL/domain access that an extension needs. It&#x27;d probably get pretty complex, but I think we could put together something reasonable. But then the other problem is the pile of plugins out there already with those arbitrary permissions. Maybe you could let them stay, but not allow any updates without switching to the new permission model?",1390073587

I&#x27;ve used sysv-init and upstart (but, to be honest, mostly using the sysv emulation) with Debian and Ubuntu for years, and often see problems the packaged init shell scripts. Bad &#x27;restart&#x27; and &#x27;reload&#x27; logic, unreliable &#x27;stop&#x27;, inconsistent output, etc. Upstart&#x27;s configuration files have been a huge boon- people just screw them up less than shell scripts. Systemd service files are the same.<p>And really, for most things <i>you don&#x27;t need anything complicated</i>. You want to listen on a socket. If something bad happens, there needs to be an alert and the thing should be restarted. If it can&#x27;t restart, give it a couple seconds. Eventually a meat person will wander over and figure it out.<p>> this leads you to build in things like monitoring, trending, alerting, quotas, resource limits, and generally design your system better to detect, withstand and prevent fault, instead of just reflexively killing and restarting anything when the eventual problems happen.<p>systemd is <i>great</i> for quotas and resource limits, because they&#x27;re such a heavy user of cgroups. It&#x27;s an easy win. For the rest- do you build that in to your server processes?<p>Look, at bottom, all init systems run an executable with arguments. If you need to run a shell script to launch your daemon, you can still run a shell script to launch your daemon. The things that are important are:\n * Do they do the OS bootstrapping well?\n * Are they reliable?\n * What tools do they provide to manage your daemons?<p>SysV and Upstart seem OK at the first two. SysV provides almost no tools, Upstart has a bunch of improvements, though some are arguably busted. Systemd has done a really impressive job at the third.<p>The general response to that is the infinitely disappointing &quot;I have an unspecified unhandled corner case and you are violating the unix philosophy by not using 10,000 poorly written shell scripts&quot;.<p>> ... so that when the state of your database/index/locking/etc goes wacky because some job was killed before it could release the lock, you can then write a lock-cleaner-upper and a post-killing-script-execution add-on to systemd. i&#x27;m sure they already thought of that (or encountered it on a running system) so it&#x27;s probably already a feature, but if not: yikes.<p>I posted a link to the man page already, and if you go to it and search for &#x27;ExecStart&#x27;, you will see a whole list of things- you can specify commands to start, reload, or restart your daemon, to run after stopping, as watchdogs, etc. If you have these problems they can be handled just fine.",1390073353

So...<p>* * *<p>Let&#x27;s see; for me, if I can map an abstract concept to something readily visual, my understanding is faster. Are there some close visual aids to understanding tensors?<p>What physical property(ies?) can be mathematically modeled as a tensor?<p>Imagine a stack of tiles, bottom to top, thin and piled on top of each other. And each tile is connected with its neighbours with springs (not unlike a spring-coiled bed with many layers), like so:<p>============== ---> Thin tile<p>\\   \\   \\   \\<p>/   /   /   /    ---> Springs<p>\\   \\   \\   \\<p>==============<p>\\   \\   \\   \\<p>/   /   /   /<p>\\   \\   \\   \\<p>==============<p>\\   \\   \\   \\<p>/   /   /   /<p>\\   \\   \\   \\<p>==============<p>Now, we can pull the topmost tile along the stacked direction causing the springs to expand. If we do this and only this, it is pure tensile stress (I am referring to stress in a bit loose way here). We can also sit on that stack and that leads to compressive stress (just a tensile stress with a minus sign). [As a sidenote, bricks can take great compressive forces but can&#x27;t withstand tensile forces of similar levels. But something like steel has almost symmetric response between tensile and compressive loads].<p>OK...what else can we do? Can I pull the topmost tile to the right (or left) while holding the bottommost tile still? Sure, and now the stack looks like a rhombus. This is shear stress...in the right-left direction. I could&#x27;ve also pulled the topmost tile towards (or away from) me. That is also shear stress in the front-back direction.<p>So, for this setup, we can identify three stress components: 1 tensile and 2 shear.<p>Now, the first tricky bit: imagine a &quot;stack&quot; that is bottom-top, left-right and front-back. There are springs running in all three directions. We have 3 tensile and 6 shear components.<p>Second tricky bit: shrink that new whole &quot;stack&quot; to a point. We have the stress tensor(!).<p>s = [s_11 s_12 s_13, s_21 s_22 s_23, s_31 s_32 s_33]<p>Tensors are used all the time in mechanics. Very very useful stuff.",1390073267

(Though it&#x27;s not a question you&#x27;ll encounter every day.[1])<p>I think you&#x27;re ignoring what, exactly, a minimax algorithm entails: it&#x27;s not a goal-directed least-cost search, like, say, A⁎. Instead, it&#x27;s more about <i>picking</i> and <i>weighting</i> a set of potential goals, <i>given</i> the costs involved with pursuing them.<p>So the question becomes, in effect, not &quot;what road should I take to get to X,&quot; but rather, &quot;which road should I start heading down, assuming I&#x27;ll narrow down the set of possible Xes I might want to pick later, that will cause me the least problem for any given X I might have chosen?&quot;<p>Oddly enough, this is a question driving-directions programs have a heuristic for. If you chart a course, on e.g. Google Maps, between suburban addresses in two different cities, the directions will almost always start with what amounts to &quot;first, get out of the suburbs, so you can reach the highway.&quot;<p>Given this, <i>without knowing where you&#x27;re going</i>, &quot;get out of the suburbs and onto the highway&quot; is a high-value guess in how to get there.[2] You might be wrong, of course: the place you might like to go might end up being in the same neighborhood you were already in. But, <i>across the set of all possible destinations</i>, you&#x27;ll regret the strategy of heading to the highway <i>less often</i> than you will the strategy of &quot;sit in your driveway waiting to see where you&#x27;re supposed to be going.&quot;<p>---<p>[1] It&#x27;s kind of an inhuman way of thinking, really. Humans tend to come with both &quot;axiomatic&quot; terminal goals, and deontological notions of how they have to get where they&#x27;re going. Minimax solutions only become relevant when, for example, you&#x27;ve decided that what you&#x27;d like to do with your life is &quot;to pursue, in a consequentialist manner, the maximum amount of money-earned-per-unit-time, so I can then engage in effective altruism.&quot; ;)<p>(More generally, though, every real-world question people deal with where they want a &quot;good answer that leaves my options open&quot; is actually a bit of goal-directed search, and a bit of minimax. You do want to invest effort getting to X; but you don&#x27;t want <i>to have invested</i> too much, if it turns out X is closed, or your friend wants to meet at Y instead.)<p>[2] Actually, I just thought of a real-world scenario for this. A lot of jobs (e.g. truckers, ambulance drivers, taxis) involve a combination of a driver and a dispatcher, where the driver has to be ready to get &quot;anywhere&quot; the dispatcher might tell them to go. If dispatches come in steadily, then the driver must simply travel directly from the end of whatever route the last dispatch took them on to the beginning of the next. But if the driver has enough time between the end of the previous dispatch, and the start of the next, then where should they drive toward, optimally, to <i>wait</i>?",1390072196

The first category are sites which are a labor of love: they are written and maintained because someone just wants to have a voice, or to get their information out there.  These sites can often be run on nearly-free hardware from a home Internet connection that you would be paying for anyway.  Hardware and bandwidth costs are near zero, or low enough that the operator is willing to cover them at a loss.  The operator is not expecting to make money, so advertising is not necessary.<p>The second category are sites operated by businesses that are expecting to make money by selling a genuine product or service.  These sites have non-trivial costs to develop, operate, and maintain, but the sites lives on the cost side, not the revenue side, of the balance sheet.  That&#x27;s OK, because the business sells something else which (presumably) covers that cost and then some.<p>The &quot;publishers&quot; expecting to make money from advertising fall into neither of these categories.  They are operating sites with the expectation of making money, but they have nothing generating revenue except advertising placed in their &quot;content&quot;.<p>Hoping to make money by running a web site that does nothing but serve pages for free is an unsustainable business model.  If you want to make money, sell something less ephemeral than a web page.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that <i>publishing</i> (without the scare quotes) is an unsustainable business.  If your product is your &quot;content&quot;, put it in a form that someone will actually want to buy, like a book or a magazine.  Something that your customers can hang on to, that they can reference when they&#x27;re away from their browsers, that they can lend to their friends, that doesn&#x27;t simply disappear at your whim.  People do pay for those things, and they even tolerate ads there.

7081831,comment,7081502,7081502,17,0,hackinthebochs,,,"I was thinking about this just the other day. The movement towards auto-update-everything is a massive security breech. Browser extensions are a prime example. So much of what we do is centered around the browser, and yet we allow essentially random pieces of code complete access to all that activity. Even worse, this code is allowed to download and run new versions without any user interaction. Needless to say, the potential for harm here cannot be understated.<p>Auto updating anything but the most critical and most trusted software is absolutely bone-headed and we&#x27;re going to look back and wonder how we could be so stupid.",1390071872

The people who forced themselves to use MFC and C++ on Windows were missing out big time on the ease of use of Delphi and VCL.

7081823,comment,7080862,7080862,2,0,72deluxe,,,"I used to use Borland&#x27;s products in a job. They used C++ Builder 6 and migrated their code to the later compiler, Codegear 2007 and it was truly dire (6 was alright). It was exceptionally buggy, the linker continually crashed, and the help system took 14 hours to install (not an exaggeration). The VCL had difficulty with manifests and proper theming on XP and above I think (particularly tab pages) and it desperately needed fixing / replacing. The company tested the version after 2007 and it would compile illegal C++.<p>I think after they spent years developing C++ Architect and then chucking it in the bin, many of the developers jumped ship and Borland was left with few developers, a shell of its former self. They also had stupid products like their PHP IDE (I wonder how many they actually sold???) and as far as I know the company I used to work for is still making software using the creaking aging VCL! A large code base to rewrite is no fun!<p>A shame for Borland (or whatever they are called these days) but I am not inclined to buy this software.",1390071739
