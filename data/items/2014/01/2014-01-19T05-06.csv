7083543,comment,7081761,7082283,3,0,lstamour,,,"> So we&#x27;re back to the issue of how do we prove not just competence but excellence in a field?<p>See, that&#x27;s what bugs me about this article. Not once did it address this most relevant of topics head on. It skirts it, suggesting that people don&#x27;t even want to consider how someone becomes an &quot;expert&quot; to the point where the word &quot;expert&quot; is used insultingly. But I think part of it, a larger part, is simple cynicism stemming from the awareness we all now have that: with greater access to information, the world is less one-sided and more complicated than we expect. As we get more adjusted to having the Internet, we realize that anyone can &quot;sound like an expert&quot; and so -- to come back to my original point -- proof is important. I&#x27;m not saying &quot;prove it,&quot; as the author did, for I&#x27;m just as willing to hear someone&#x27;s backstory and trust via third-parties. But ... when it comes to what&#x27;s on the news, to politics, to business, services, almost any point where an expert can be useful -- there&#x27;s a sense of &quot;if you do a good job, we&#x27;ll trust you&quot; that now more than ever withholds trust unless you can also be charming. Sadly, in news cycles especially, if you&#x27;re doing a good job, no one will notice you or your &quot;proof&quot; until you screw up. And being an effective personality doesn&#x27;t require expertise to have opinions.",1390111125

7083509,comment,7083397,7083397,9,0,rbritton,,,"I&#x27;ve developed using both. Dropbox is much more well-known overall where Box is much more well-known in the enterprise area. From the iOS developer side of things I much prefer Dropbox and here&#x27;s why:<p>- Box&#x27;s SDK authentication uses a modal view controller with a web view to authenticate. Its appearance is somewhat unpolished and glitchy. Dropbox redirects to the Dropbox app if installed and if not uses a modal view controller. Box used to use this method but no longer does for some reason. It&#x27;s much more cumbersome to log in without it.<p>- Dropbox is path-based and all actions are based on a path. Box requires that you recursively iterate from the root to get each level&#x27;s unique ID if all you have is a path.<p>- Box&#x27;s SDK has had a much slower development cycle than Dropbox. There are many operations that are not yet coded.<p>- Box refreshes the login token frequently, which has a tendency to slow things down.<p>All of these make something as common as a file chooser much, much easier to implement on Dropbox.",1390110124

7083457,comment,7083151,7083151,39,0,bane,,,"I grew up outside of DC and can probably say this about the city:<p>Washington D.C. thinks of itself as the center of power of the entire universe. And in a lot of ways it is. But it&#x27;s a weird city. Power in D.C. is indirect and complex. You can&#x27;t really start at the bottom and work your way up to positions of extreme power (though it&#x27;s a popular story)...hard ceilings are everywhere. To be clear, I&#x27;m not talking about the more or less irrelevant city government.<p>The best way I can explain it is this, power in D.C. is build on a tripod. You must have all three of these things to be powerful: money, widespread popularity, and cunning (not intelligence).<p>This is different than other cities, where elements of this tripod exist, but aren&#x27;t necessary to be powerful in that city. For example, in NYC, money is sufficient to be powerful. But even billionaires have failed to attain power in D.C. In NYC political connections are useful for making more money, but aren&#x27;t strictly necessary. In D.C. political connections are critical. In NYC, you have to have alpha-like mammal aggressiveness (not necessarily intelligence), but in D.C. it&#x27;s reptile like cunning that&#x27;s needed. You can draw different but similar differences with other cities and power.<p>Power in D.C. is also incredibly transient and fickle. In theory, power in D.C. can accumulate to the point that a single individual can more or less wipe out all life on the planet, then just a couple years later has trouble keeping reporters off of his vacation property. It&#x27;s a tower of power that&#x27;s built on sands that shift so fast it makes the stock market look like a simple linear function. <i>Everybody</i> falls from power in D.C. It&#x27;s the tallest tower there is, but the downward drop is inevitable. The key is making a soft landing when you do. That way you can take a &quot;fall back&quot; position to power in NYC on the board of an investment company or the Bay Area where you can become an Angel investor.<p>But you&#x27;ll notice that people who are really powerful in one place rarely move from where they know how to operate, and when they do, rarely gain positions of equivalent power in their new homes. They just operate differently. Throwing money around in D.C. might make you popular for a bit, but without cunning you&#x27;ll just be that guy who throws lots of parties.<p>It reminds me of the old saying<p>&quot;Rich is being a millionaire basketball player, Wealthy is being the guy who signs the checks&quot;<p>add to that &quot;Powerful is the guy who proposed the bill that got turned into a law with teeth that regulated the NBA and bankrupted the wealthy owners.&quot;",1390108437

It is clear (in my opinion) that quantum coherent motion not play a large role in energy transfer in photosynthesis, but I think the jury is still out on whether or not it plays a small role or none at all.<p>Part of the answer may depend on how &quot;coherence&quot; is defined. I do have a number of objections to the conclusions drawn in the paper discussed in the blog post you link to (about the 8th chromophore). For more details, you can see a paper I wrote a few years ago [2]. I don&#x27;t agree with the interpretation that &quot;The energy transfer is incoherent in the native complex.&quot; This is still a rather large point of contention among scholars in this field.<p>The differences between quantum computing in the brain and quantum coherence in photosynthesis are actually rather large. There is actual, essentially undisputed evidence for quantum coherence in photosynthesis (in the experiments). There is a real scientific process going on with interactions between experiment/theory. Moreover, the people who did the over-hyped experiments a few years ago that were published in Nature/Science have moved on from claiming it is &quot;quantum computing in biology&quot; when further evidence and analyses came out against it.
