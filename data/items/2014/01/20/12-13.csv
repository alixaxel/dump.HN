Merchants prefer not to handle cash because it&#x27;s safer (robbing a store with no money is pointless) and cheaper (no dealing with money transports, deposits, counting the registers, having change on hand). Compared to all of that, getting card terminals is cheap.<p>Using the same system for Credit Cards is mostly just a side-effect of the push to eliminate cash. It&#x27;s also the reason Credit Card usage isn&#x27;t all that widespread in the Netherlands.

7089220,comment,7088042,7088746,5,0,dalke,,,"Obviously providing jobs for tax payers isn&#x27;t unique to companies. I can pay for a nanny, chauffeur, and private cook even if I don&#x27;t have a company. Since your logic is &quot;X provides jobs so X shouldn&#x27;t be taxed&quot; then I shouldn&#x27;t have to be taxed if I have any household staff, no?<p>That logic makes no sense. (If it makes sense to you, please elaborate. How many employees and how many FTEs does one need before this special exemption kicks in, and why that level?)<p>Now, by &quot;company&quot; I assume you mean &quot;corporation.&quot; Corporations form for various reasons, the biggest being liability. Without it, shareholders could be sued individually.<p>This protection is worth something to the shareholders. I think it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable that the state, which is the authority that grants companies the right to exist, should be able to extract something from the company - taxes and fees, for example - in order that the company may continue.<p>Do you think that corporations should exist without paying any fees to the state? If so, why should they get liability protection for free?<p>If the tax rate is too high, then people could switch from the corporate form of company to a sole proprietorship. A sole proprietor can have employees, and thus &quot;provide jobs for tax payers&quot;, even though the business itself is not taxed separately from the proprietor&#x27;s income.<p>Now, obviously there&#x27;s a large set of trade-offs, and the example I gave - a switch to sole proprietorship - is too blunt. My point is that the idea that &quot;provide jobs&quot; necessarily implies &quot;should not be taxed&quot; is so simplistic that it more indicates a lack of understanding of why there are companies in the first place.",1390222592

On the one hand, science has brought us all sorts of good things but it&#x27;s also yielded weapons of mass destruction. (Ironically, Warren Buffet once famously - and presciently - described derivatives as &quot;financial weapons of mass destruction&quot;[1].)<p><i>> So, you enter a contract to sell your crop at a fixed rate long before harvest comes along. That&#x27;s a future contract...</i><p>Technically (and pedantically), that&#x27;s actually a forward contract, which is, admittedly, very similar in nature to a futures contract[2] (and, typically, a forward contract will often underpin a futures contract) and a perfectly excusable error to make. The reason I point it out is not to score a point but to highlight the distinction in order to illustrate how esoteric the financial markets can be.<p>Their esotericness/esotericity (clearly not real words but I think you get my point) means that the specialised knowledge and skills are highly valued. We generally accept that a ninja/rockstar engineers can be 10x as productive as an average engineer. The distinction is even more marked in finance - not only can a more knowledgable, better-skilled, more talented person make more money than someone who isn&#x27;t as good, but the latter can end up actually <i>losing</i> large amounts of money (e.g. JP Morgan&#x27;s London whale[3]). I learnt this the hard way just a few weeks into my (short) career as a trader when I made a very simple mistake and lost $16,000. Do that once or twice a week, and you&#x27;ll easily end up down over a million dollars over the course of a year. To avoid &quot;fat finger&quot; errors, you need to be capable of being very focused for (in my case) up to 12 hours a day (or, at least, being able to switch from &quot;relaxed, joking with your work colleagues&quot; mode to &quot;laser-focus&quot; mode in a split second). Not everyone is capable of doing that. Some people can&#x27;t handle the pressure. Others simply lack the brain configuration required to do it - they may well be smart, intelligent people - it&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s a very specialised job and some people&#x27;s brains are going to instinctively better at it than others.<p>Add to that the fact that the financial markets are, by and large, a zero-sum game (which means that the best guys can actually take money <i>off</i> the not-so-good guys) and you have a situation where the top talent are able to demand (and end up feeling entitled to) the sort of pay packets mentioned in the original article.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like Mayer hiring De Castro at Yahoo![4] - if he&#x27;d turned Yahoo!&#x27;s advertising business around, the company would have earned $600m more revenue over the past year, and a $60m pay package wouldn&#x27;t have looked so crazy. If a bank hires a rockstar trader away from their competitor by offering a salary of $3m and he makes a $300m trading profit over the course of the year, it&#x27;s a pretty good deal. On the other hand, of course, they could lose $300m and this was traditionally an asymmetric, one-way bet (i.e. if the trader made profit, he got a bonus but if he lost money, he didn&#x27;t suffer any downside, which meant that he was implicitly incentivised to make big, dangerous bets) until new rules came in around claw-back provisions (so previous year&#x27;s bonuses could be reclaimed if it turns out they were based on phantom profits) and paying bonuses partly in shares (thereby linking traders&#x27; fortunes more closely to their employers&#x27;).<p>I still work in finance but back on the technology side of the fence (I&#x27;m basically a freelance product manager for an in-house piece of software that&#x27;s used by a couple hundred people globally). I spend 25% less time at work than I did as a trader (i.e. 9 hours maximum instead of 12), the work&#x27;s a lot less stressful and I find it interesting/challenging/fun. Whether I&#x27;m still doing it in six months time (as opposed to, say, working for a startup) is anyone&#x27;s guess but the perceived social worth (or, more accurately, the lack thereof) of finance in general wouldn&#x27;t be a factor in that decision.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2002pdf.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2002pdf.pdf</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-1/derivatives/futures-versus-forwards.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-1/derivativ...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_JPMorgan_Chase_trading_loss"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_JPMorgan_Chase_trading_los...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7068455"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7068455</a>",1390221868

I personally prefer Ruby while Python is easier to deploy on a server. But you&#x27;ll attract more data scientists with Python when your prototype is mature.<p>PHP : while easy to learn, i would not recommend it.It&#x27;s an old badly designed language that has little future outside cmses.I only use it to customize CMSes today,i would not develop any app from scratch with it, furthermore writing PHP is awfull compared to Ruby and Python.<p>NodeJS: While Javascript everywhere seems like a good idea(you&#x27;ll have to learn Javascript to script the browser anyway), NodeJS use async programming , and async programming is hard,no matter what people say, furthermore Node is not mature yet, especially its libraries.<p>Java(JVM):If you have time try it(Spring/Play/...). It will feel hard and verbose but You&#x27;ll learn a lot of interesting concepts. If you want to code a prototype quickly forget about it.

Their own emotions are strongly influenced by the emotional atmosphere and other peoples&#x27; emotions. If others are having a bad day, they&#x27;re having a bad day. When asking about the ethical thing to do, they refer to societal norms - what OTHER people feel. They want their peers to agree with their opinions and may feel bad if others disagree. If they&#x27;ve done something immoral, their strongest cues will not be how they feel, but if those around them have an unfavorable reaction. But because they are more aware of others&#x27; feelings then Fi users, they are better at deliberately doing or saying things that give people positive feelings. These are the types of people who can be referred to as &quot;people-pleasers.&quot; Their facial expressions are often quite animated, with big flowing natural smiles.\nTeachers, hosts, caretakers, diplomats, politicians, salespeople, receptionists, waiters/waitresses, PR reps, missionaries.<p>Introverted Feeling - Fi is basically Feeling turned inward. Those who use this function have feelings that are more hidden from view; they are less obvious and they may only share their true feelings with their close friends and family members. To decide if something is moral, they simply ask themselves how THEY feel. So if everyone thinks that eating chocolate chip cookies is okay, but they feel that it&#x27;s truly wrong, they will have a personal problem with seeing people eat chocolate chip cookies and not eat them themselves. They are not as expressive as Fe users, but they probably feel their emotions more acutely since they don&#x27;t convey them directly. If Fe is direct expression, Fi is indirect expression. Instead saying &quot;great job, you rock!&quot; they would give thumbs up with a sincere smile. They also focus on individual feelings rather than group feelings. Their facial expressions are rather constrained and may give the impression of pride and passion.\nArtists, poets, composers, therapists, counselors, writers, speech pathologists, photographers.&quot;",1390219874

I tried to add the Annapurna Circuit in Nepal which I did a few months ago (and is actually a series of hikes between villages) but I could not figure it out and gave up.<p>Good work though, don&#x27;t give up now! I know a lot of people who have been looking for a site like that :-)",1390219386

7089053,comment,7087683,7088470,5,0,Dogamondo,,,"I used to work in IT recruitment, and had CV&#x27;s coming at me every day. One particular candidate popped up in my database search who possessed the rare skill that I was looking for. Her last CV in our system was 3 years old. Anyway, I called her up and asked if she might be still in that field. It turns out the call was made in likely timing. She had just been divorced and  explained that she was looking to get back into the workforce after being a homemaker for the past 3 years. I added a note to the call log for other recruiters who may see her record saying &quot;Great candidate, gap in work history due to marriage. Now divorced and wanting to get back get back into the industry. Definitely worth interviewing!&quot;.<p>Now lets imagine that the agency I worked for was sold/aquired at some point and eventually resulted in a mailout being performed on the database.<p>You can imagine the result if the comment field was accidentally included in the mail-merge, or some substring of it;<p>&quot;Dear Great candidate, gap in work history due to marriage. Now divorced and wanting to get back get back into the industry, have you considered funeral insurance?&quot;<p>Pattio11&#x27;s point is quite valid.<p>Edit: Sorry, hit the wrong &#x27;reply&#x27; button.
