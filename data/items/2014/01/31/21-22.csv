I remember learning from adjuncts as an undergrad, and often, they were much more down to earth, current on the subject area, and practical with their advice then tenured professors.  Tenured professors were often out of touch with the current state of the practice, and more focused on the theory.  Adjuncts were often much better leads for internship referrals and job opportunities as well.<p>I now work full time in the technology sector, and teach at most one class per semester for a well-known state university.

I know I&#x27;ll probably get crucified for saying this, but video games are only a good business if you&#x27;re making the games themselves. The hardware is low margin, and you don&#x27;t really make it up on the licensing anymore either since gamers have so many platforms to choose from. Worse still, you can&#x27;t form a dominant platform through the methods Microsoft traditionally uses: you have to convince consumers directly. And video games are just a &quot;good&quot; business, never a great one: they are very risky and the maximum payout is limited. EA and Activision both made about $5 billion in revenue. Combined they made as much as half of the Server and Tools business (and at much lower margins.)<p>Microsoft&#x27;s core strength is licensing software to businesses. Hardware and game consoles are a foray into a high-risk, low-margin business (well, low margin relative to software.) By contrast, Microsoft&#x27;s operating margin on enterprise software is close to 50%. The margin on their entertainment and devices division is currently less than 1%. Comparables would say that a good margin in a hardware business like that is 10-20%.<p>Worse still, selling consumer electronics and media properties to consumers requires a sales channel that Microsoft has still not mastered. Windows and enterprise software are sold through a reseller model: Microsoft makes products and advertises them to a network of people who have discovered they can make a living selling and implementing Microsoft software (be they PC OEMs or consultants.) They have <i>never</i> been good at consumer marketing or retail sales. They&#x27;ve never had that &quot;cool&quot; brand image you need to succeed there, and the amount of money you have to spend on marketing is insane compared to their more profitable cash cow.<p>There&#x27;s still plenty of room for them to innovate in the enterprise space too. Oracle and SAP suck donkey balls to use and Microsoft is actually really good at delivering rock-solid enterprise software with a good blend of usability and power. I just fear that if any new CEO focuses too much on the consumer side of the business, there are a lot of much more profitable options on the enterprise side.<p>The consumer side is a huge distraction to Microsoft, one that  has produced a lot of red ink but never really any profit. Look at their historical results since, well, ever, and you&#x27;ll see that the consumer products consistently lose money while the enterprise software keeps growing margins and top line.",1391204850

You personally might not need even 90% of them, but you <i>cannot</i> make the claim that Min has anywhere <i>near</i> the features of Bootstrap. It&#x27;s disingenuous. I wouldn&#x27;t make the claim for YUI&#x27;s Pure[0], and it&#x27;s a similarly-scoped framework. In fact, that&#x27;s one of the selling points to a minimal framework - it isn&#x27;t &quot;bloated&quot;.<p>2. That&#x27;s because that example page requires jQuery, just like many other sites require jQuery. I&#x27;ve used Bootstrap several times as just a CSS framework, and it works well. You obviously can&#x27;t use any js modules, as all of them depend on jQ, but none of the pure-css modules do.<p>3. I have built custom versions of Bootstrap, so yes I would do it. I&#x27;d wager most people wouldn&#x27;t, but I don&#x27;t know if I see that as a fault of Bootstrap&#x27;s. I applaud you encouraging modularity, and I wish that more people would go that route with Bootstrap.<p>Normalize is intended to give consistent results across browsers. If you&#x27;ve accounted for all of the discrepancies between browsers, then that&#x27;s great! I&#x27;d wager that there are some cases that you haven&#x27;t caught.<p>I understand where you&#x27;re coming from wrt. monolithic frameworks, and I do wish more people would take the time to slim down their libraries.

Do you explain (1) 2+2, (2) user/kernel space, (3) what a _compat usually is for or (4) what this particular _compat does?<p>I for one would draw the line before (4). The original developer drew it after. If I would explain API conventions I would draw it before (3) but crypto _API_ for example has the line after (4). And there are appropriate places for (1) and (2) also.<p>The point is, you address to some audience. But even if the code is clean, a newcomer will have a hard time getting up to speed if he has no idea about the context. The way I see it, for some parts of the kernel, either the code is too precious to be touched or the maintainers do not have any interest in explaining it to an outsider. It&#x27;s like they are loosing knowledge by sharing.<p>Think new comers. How can you make them contribute? Or maybe the barrier to entry is high enough on purpose?",1391202333

He did a lot of good when he was in office and fulfilled his campaign promises.<p>A lot of people look at the light rail in Minnesota as a huge success, but it was Ventura who believed in the project from the beginning and actually got additional funding to keep it going when both Democrats and Republicans were trying to kill the project.",1391202109
7159153,comment,7157758,7158891,1,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, in practice I think it&#x27;s converged to a similar sort of thing, though the Kansas version does have better-intentioned origins. Rather than having a bill covertly written by lobbyists and then sponsored by a Congressman who claims to be advocating it but actually had little to do with its drafting (as happens at the federal level), the original idea of some of these state-level practices was to open up the legislature to citizen-proposed legislation. Some states (like California) went all the way with a robust citizen-initiative system where citizens can directly propose legislation that has to receive a vote. Others developed conventions more like Kansas&#x27;s, where the norm was that legislators are supposed to forward reasonable legislation for a vote even if they don&#x27;t personally advocate it, and this was done quite openly (&quot;I&#x27;m forwarding this bill by request of so-and-so&quot;). So the response to a citizen asking the legislator to sponsor a bill becomes three- rather than two-valued: the legislator could draft and sponsor legislation in their own name to that end; could reject it entirely and refuse to introduce anything along those lines; or third, they could pass the citizen-written bill along for a vote as-is, without working on or endorsing it themselves.<p>I doubt it really works like that in practice anymore, if it ever did (my guess is that, if you aren&#x27;t important, your chances of having a bill you send be seriously considered are pretty small), but I can see why it was an attractive idea.",1391202104
