I&#x27;m saying that, given a uniformly random sample of Bay Area vs. outside programmer, I would expect the Bay Area programmer to be &quot;better&quot; for some set of objective measures.<p>And I&#x27;d expect that given a uniformly random sample of say.... Seattle vs Bay Area programmers I would expect the seattle programmer to be &quot;better&quot;. But then again, both of our expectations are meaningless without real data.<p>> If you don&#x27;t think that, then you also have to disagree with basic market dynamics. Good programmers can earn more money here, and expose themselves to significant upside opportunities -- both social and financial<p>And then you clearly do not understand that market dynamics don&#x27;t exist in a vacuum considering salary alone. And are really only meaningful when considering salary in terms of buying power. And considering the cost of living in the bay area, there are many places where a programmer can make more &quot;buying power&quot; thus giving them the actual significant upside opportunities you suggest.",1391155096

7155804,comment,7155595,7155595,4,0,Zarel,,,"I disagree; I think the biggest problem with Windows 8 has always been its poor usability: specifically, its discoverability.<p>It was really bad back in the times of the developer preview. You booted into the lockscreen, and all you saw was a clock and a picture. No &quot;continue&quot; button, no clue of any sort for how you were supposed to get past it - back then you could only get past it by clicking it and dragging it up, which a lot of people could not figure out.<p>This sort of design, the idea of &quot;remove affordances to make things look less cluttered, even though it makes it harder to learn to use&quot; is all over Windows 8.<p>Say you double-click an image file. By default, this opens the image in the Metro app. Which means now you have the image full-screen, with nothing else on the screen. What do you do? There are no buttons on-screen to hint at all for how to go back. Esc doesn&#x27;t leave the app.<p>The biggest reason a tablet-optimized OS is so unusable on desktop is that tablets have a big obvious &quot;Home&quot; button. On mouse+keyboard, the Windows Logo Key is the analogous button, but that&#x27;s not clear to most users. If you ask a user what button they&#x27;d expect to use to leave an app, they&#x27;d say Esc (which doesn&#x27;t leave Metro apps).<p>The way Windows 8 is now, it completely eliminates one of the biggest advantages of a GUIs: the ability to use a computer without reading a manual or being taught in some way.<p><a href=""http://xkcd.com/627/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/627/</a><p>GUIs were an amazing invention because they made possible the workflow of: &quot;If you want to do X, look for a button with &#x27;X&#x27; written on it, or look through menus for &#x27;X&#x27;, or look for buttons with labels related to &#x27;X&#x27;.&quot;<p>OS X works like this, Windows earlier than 7 works like this, even most Linux distros are set up to work like this by default. But Windows 8, you just get a bunch of nothing. Critical functionality is hidden away and can only be used by obscure mouse gestures and keyboard shortcuts. I&#x27;ve seen someone described it as &quot;user-hostile&quot; - he opened the Charms bar by accident from moving the mouse, finally being able to shut down, but could not figure out how to get it back.<p>Usability has slowly gotten better between the first Windows 8 developer preview and Windows 8.1, but it&#x27;s still incomplete, and a Windows 8.1 Update 1 is yet another a step in the right direction.",1391154380

That should be obvious!<p>When I first installed Windows 8, the first thing I had to do was disable the Metro versions of each and every staple app so they launched in desktop mode when run. Before upgrading to 8.1, the first thing I had to do <i>every time I started up my machine</i> was switch back to the desktop.<p>I did this not because I&#x27;m low end and abhor all change, I did this because my machine doesn&#x27;t have touch, just a mouse and keyboard, and because it&#x27;s completely ludicrous to take up my entire (rather large) monitor to show things like a single progress bar when I could have that to the side to monitor while doing something else in a OS that supported windowed apps.<p>Microsoft hasn&#x27;t done a good enough job fusing their UI metaphors yet. It was incredibly ambitious to even attempt to do so, as interactions are so diverse. Regardless of ambition, though, <i>in practice</i> it&#x27;s really a drag to force a half-baked attempt on everyone when desktop users are just going to have to go around adjusting things to be fully usable on the large class of machines that don&#x27;t have touch support.<p>I&#x27;ll note also that, in spite of UI innovation in iOS and OS X, I don&#x27;t have to depend on Siri to launch an app or only use Launchpad on the desktop. Apple doesn&#x27;t do this because they know these interfaces aren&#x27;t so good that they could forever replace what users have today.<p>If LaunchPad became the only way to launch apps in OS X and by default all the built-in apps ran fullscreen iPad style, you can bet your life there would be just as much grumbling and moaning from those famed Apple customers as you&#x27;re seeing today in Windows-land.",1391153611

Try to fix it (doesn&#x27;t happen locally...), push, fail to kick of the execution of the build script.. Loop.<p>- The miner: As I said, I loved the idea of that challenge.

This year I finally sat down and worked out the spreadsheets and last year my family paid nearly $12k in premiums + out of pocket and yet we had only $6k in actual costs.  We are now on an HDHP that costs $1500/year and pays for hardly anything initially, but caps our annual out-of-pocket at around $12k.

He actually started with the Broncos as an undrafted free agent out of college, then broke his arm in training camp and was ultimately cut.  Unable to latch on with another NFL team, he started playing in Canada and was there for several years.  When Pete Carroll was hired as the coach in Seattle, he inherited a lackluster roster and was looking to upgrade talent.  He remembered Browner from Pac-10 (now Pac-12) college days (Browner played for Oregon State University, Pete Carroll coached USC), and gave him a try out.  Browner made the team, became a starter.<p>After he was cut from Denver, he was reportedly broke, sleeping on friends couches and there was no reliable way to contact him (no cell phone).  Once you&#x27;re a member of the NFL player&#x27;s union, you&#x27;re obligated to take drug tests.  What Browner didn&#x27;t know (and most everyone, for that matter) was that unless you file your retirement papers, you&#x27;re still under obligation to take the drug tests.  Browner was supposed to take the drug tests, but without any way to contact him, he wasn&#x27;t able to do so and didn&#x27;t realize he was missing them.  Missing a drug test automatically places one into &quot;stage-3 offender&quot; status, which basically means that if you fail any sort of drug test, you&#x27;re automatically banned from the NFL (but can apply for reinstatement after a year - which is almost always granted).<p>So, what happened was is that he smoked weed and failed the test.  Because he was placed in stage-3 due to his missed drug tests while he was in Canada, this failed drug test means he is suspended for a year and can apply for reinstatement after his suspension is up.  It is devastating to him because he was on track to get a lucrative contract, as he is an above-average cornerback in the NFL.  Now he will enter free-agency suspended for the better part of next year, and at the age 30 (which doesn&#x27;t bode well for NFL players).<p>I love Browner and hope they get it sorted out.  I&#x27;ve watched him play for years: he went to my alma mater and plays for my favorite NFL team.<p>Can&#x27;t believe I just posted about sports on HN...",1391152953

Get real cloud-based software solutions that compete with Google SaaS officeware, but tie it into desktop office in a way that synergizes without forcing people to subscribe or upgrade.<p>Apple is good at the monetization angle of this.  There&#x27;s no reason Microsoft couldn&#x27;t do the same (except with software, not hardware).<p>Example: 90% of the time I&#x27;m on a webex/gotomeeting, I&#x27;m looking at one of three things: 1) Powerpoint, 2) Excel/Word or 3) a Browser.<p>Why can&#x27;t Microsoft make that kind of sharing easier?  My guess is that they were too arrogant to make things work for the folks not on the latest versions, or on different OS&#x27;s.<p>It&#x27;s 2014, that&#x27;s not good enough.

They made several million on this contract, which they would have been incapable of getting without me joining and actually doing the work.<p>They billed me out for exceedingly profitable work; I did 100% of the work, their overhead for all the shit you mention did not increase, and they piled more work onto my efforts which they billed for.<p>they promised me a multi-tens-of-thousands bonus based on all this work and met with me on five separate occasions to go over documented revenue/bonus projections and confirm this amount (this was with the CEO) -- then when it came time to pay; they paid me 8% of the promised, documented bonus. and made excuses that &quot;they weren&#x27;t being paid by the client&quot; -- and later had a seperate manager (known as &quot;the snake&quot;) come in and tell me &quot;tough luck - the CEO&#x27;s calcs were wrong&quot;<p>So, While your story sounds all nice and whatever...
