The data and code are both free, but the osm.org servers have limited capacity; you can download the code and data and run it yourself if you like.<p>Mapquest Open runs an instance of this. MQ&#x27;s servers are beefier so they have more liberal usage than osm.org&#x27;s instance.<p>&#x27;Mainstream&#x27; Mapquest uses commercial data and therefore has pretty strict ToUs.

I don&#x27;t doubt that the paper describes something new and interesting (and all engines I work with during the day do segmentation/recognize character by character), but localizing a region of interest is usually the hard job for me. When I identify the right region and crop it/scale it/rotate it .. my job&#x27;s &quot;easy&quot; and I can run a multitude of generally good OCR engines (off the shelf, if you will) and get decent results (maybe vote a bit, use engine A to segment and engine B and C to recognize the characters etc.)<p>So .. ignoring the &#x27;we trained a neural network&#x27; part (which makes me nod thoughtfully and mumble &#x27;whatever they did there..&#x27;), which I _understand_ is the interesting thing here!, they did more or less what I do all the time.\nThe preceding algorithm is what I do quite a bit less often and which in my environment is more interesting and often challenging.<p>Then again, it can always be labeled as PEBKAC I assume :)",1389088651

7016393,comment,7004935,7009218,1,0,tripzilch,,,"> Four year old kids can surf the web proficiently these days and easily get to hardcore porn by accident.<p>Bullshit. I work at a kids&#x27; technology centre, teaching them computer and Internet stuff. This is in the Netherlands, ages 8-18. (no filters, but they are supervised and we can see what&#x27;s on their monitors at all times)<p>The <i>only</i> stuff I have seen them accidentally stumble upon is the odd bikini image in Google Image Search.<p>I can&#x27;t imagine any scenario how a four year old could <i>accidentally</i> stumble upon rape porn (which is the type that&#x27;s supposedly psychologically damaging, right?). In particular because they <i>can&#x27;t type</i> (they lack the motor skills).<p>(actually I&#x27;d question how four-year-olds &quot;surf the web proficiently&quot; at all, for any definition of &quot;proficiently&quot; and any reasonable definition of &quot;the web&quot;. Public libraries are easier to use, they&#x27;re not proficient at those either)<p>In a hypothetical thought experiment, give 1,000,000 four-year-olds a tablet with a browser opened on a child-friendly start page, and let them play for an hour. None of them will stumble upon rape porn. The &quot;proficient&quot; ones will find something fun and colourful to play with. Your biggest problem is the ones that don&#x27;t, get stuck on something boring, and start crying. Good luck with that.<p>> Today, most kids today are more computer savvy than their parents. They easily get around these filters<p>Also not true. I put this to the test back when we still had these filters enabled. The two smartest kids (ages 11-12) couldn&#x27;t do it, there&#x27;s just too many hurdles, passwords, blocking, safeguards going on. It&#x27;s horrible software, really cripples the machine (which is one of the reasons why we got rid of it, favouring simple supervision). It&#x27;s quite hard to disable even if you <i>are</i> the administrator of these PCs. Super easy to set up, though. It&#x27;s a real trapdoor.<p>I have to admit I believe that they might have had a better chance if they could read English natively. At age 11-12 Dutch kids can read English, but not fast enough to do proper research on the English language web (so the solution would be for English parents to install Chinese filters, they got the experience anyway :-P).<p>Kids ages 8 or lower couldn&#x27;t do it no matter the language. There may be the odd (<i>extremely</i>) high-functioning exception, but we were talking about <i>most</i> kids.<p>And by the time they&#x27;re 16 it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s a parental filter or a government one, they can--and will--get around government-grade censorship too. But then, a 16-year-old mind can think of depravities with or without help of the Internet.<p>Just because children get better at computers than their parents all the time, doesn&#x27;t mean developmental stages suddenly disappear. See <a href""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development_stage"" rel""nofollo"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development_stages</a><p>> I wish there were a better way besides censorship. Anyone have any ideas?<p>Sure! Education. Of the parents. Way before they&#x27;re parents. It&#x27;ll take a while before it pays off but when it does, oh boy, just look at all those bad statistics just evaporating!<p>If you <i>really</i> care about the children you&#x27;d put all the money spent on this and other bullshit into improving their education.",1389086798

Whether that stage is used in an expendable launch profile or in a reusable launch profile it&#x27;s still the same hardware, the only significant difference is whether or not it has landing gear bolted on (which apparently they&#x27;ll try to do for the next ISS cargo resupply launch). That&#x27;s pretty significant because it means that they get additional testing and validation of their reusable first stage in a full up flight profile even on expendable launches like this one. The more they launch with this stage the more experience and confidence they get and the easier it will be to transition to a reusable flight profile.<p>Secondly, this launch should complete the certification program that enables the Falcon 9 v1.1 to be able to compete in EELV launches from NASA and DoD. Currently only the Atlas 5 and Delta IV fill that role (the original launchers developed out of the EELV program) and as a result United Launch Alliance (which operates both vehicles) get a significant amount of highly lucrative business. In 2014 there are 8 EELV launches, for example, and by around 2016 SpaceX could be launching EELV payloads. That&#x27;s a tremendous amount of potential income for SpaceX (up to billions of dollars a year).",1389085570
