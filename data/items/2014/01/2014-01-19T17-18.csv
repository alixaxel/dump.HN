I don&#x27;t think those are actually coincidental.<p>All the chemical engineers I know (I know a few) are pretty happy. Most find their work interesting.<p>All the humanities academics I know (I know very many, having been one in a former life) are more or less unhappy. Many find their day to day work uninteresting and unexciting.<p>Chemical engineering is a high-demand field. Not many people&#x27;s dream job.<p>Humanities academia is a low-demand field. Many people&#x27;s dream job.<p>I think &quot;work in a high demand field&quot; is better advice for any young person than &quot;do what you love,&quot; with or without qualification. Especially if they are the sort of young person who wants to be passionate and interested in their work.<p>Doing the hyperspecialized Hot Field of the Day may be a bad idea, but perennials like [software] engineering, K-12 education, finance, nursing, medicine etc. are generally going to be the best use of an intelligent student&#x27;s time.<p>Low-demand fields mean a lot of down time due to lack of funding or lack of employment. That kills passion. High-demand fields mean there&#x27;s always something to do and a new problem to solve. I think that&#x27;s more important for actually loving what you do.",1390154335

I am a self taught coder from a working class background. When I left school I was basically flung into work that I found soul destroying and depressing. At the time, I felt totally lost and wanted to kill myself.<p>I didn&#x27;t want to be the best at that. I wanted to be a computer programmer and use my creativity and intelligence.<p>Now, according to &quot;external&quot; measures I should have accepted my lot. I was from a working class area where university was unknown and I did badly at school due to bullying and an undiagnosed learning disability. But for some unknown reason I had absolutely no interest in anything that was on offer in the world around me. I only wanted to be a hacker, like those cool Californian dudes I read about in computer magazines.<p>In those early years I had a terrible time trying to convince those around me that I should be a programmer. I was accused of being lazy, awkward etc, all because I did not want what was immediately presented to me as my future. Once I had enough success to be able to call myself a programmer, it was a different story! I was hard-working, clever etc. Everything changed as soon as I was able to bring concrete expression to my inner vision.<p>In coming to terms with this, I came to realize how few people really understand the notion of self-direction. They conflate it with egoism, complain about &quot;special snowflakes&quot; etc. because they are coming from a worldview that regards the external world as fixed, and the task of the individual being to fulfill a role imposed from outside.<p>Subjectivity is a mystery to them, shadowy and morally suspect. A few of them are forced to confront it eventually. You read about them in self-help books, having to go away to &quot;find themselves&quot; whereas &quot;special snowflakes&quot; like me have always known their &quot;selves&quot; as the foundation of their experience, and struggle instead to move the bulk of the world in order to express it.",1390153798

For some in some places, renting is wiser. For others, owning a home.<p>I sure delight in knowing that the home I bought in 2010 for $195k with 20% down and a $160k mortgage at 4.85% is not only worth $220k today, but costs me the same about ($1,200) for mortgage, insurance, <i>and</i> property tax as I used to pay <i>just</i> for my rent. And the place is 3,000sqft versus 1,000sqft of the apartment. And I get all the benefits of a home, such as a lawn, storage, nobody pounding on the floor because I&#x27;m listening to music, pets, a security system, and nobody else with a key to let themselves in whenever they feel like it.<p>In addition, that $1,200 I paid in rent started as $1,000 only four years earlier. In twenty years, it&#x27;ll probably be at least $2,000+ while my mortgage will still be $850 (not counting insurance/tax). And, in the end, I&#x27;ll have actual property that is worth something.<p>I see so many of these arguments back and forth and it always sounds more like people trying to convince themselves that they made the right decision than trying to convince someone else what decision to make. It&#x27;s a lot like parents frustrated by their kids trying to convince other couples that they should have kids. Or a married couple always trying to convince their friends that they should get married.<p>It all comes down to individual situations and opportunities.

I am especially shocked by your use of lesbian intercourse as an example, since everyone knows the issue is men-who-have-sex-with-men.  Lesbians are completely irrelevant to this debate.<p>Let us compare the probability of a man getting AIDS from having sex with a random man, vs a random woman.  As you say, these are probably similar.  However, it might be very hard for a man to convince another random man to have sex with him!  So what we really want to calculate is the probability of getting AIDS from a random, actually occurring, sexual encounter (not with a prostitute) between a man and a woman, and a man and another man.  This is what the statistic is intended to mean, and how people will interpret it, even if it is not always properly qualified.  In this case, the probability of the man who has sex with a man getting AIDS is much higher, because gay men have a much higher incidence of AIDS than heterosexual women.<p>So we could add the following useless disclaimer to my earlier claim: if you are a man, sex with a <i>randomly chosen</i> man (including straight men) is not especially dangerous.  It&#x27;s only when you condition on that man being gay that it becomes statistically more dangerous.<p>Of course, this disclaimer would still be wrong since the sex with the man would probably be anal, which is inherently more likely to spread AIDS.<p>>What&#x27;s more, the qualifier that it has to be with a white woman is important.\nThat&#x27;s why I included it :)<p>I can&#x27;t comment on why AIDS is higher for heterosexuals in Africa than the US.  I don&#x27;t necessarily accept your claims about it.  But that is not the issue here.  I am talking about the probability of getting AIDS given the current situation, not any inherent link between being gay and AIDS.  The actual cause is not relevant.<p>The best that you could say, is that the reason for these misleading statistics is not to promote gay rights, but to scare people into taking precautions that are good for society as a whole.",1390151283

Regardless of rape, fraud, bribery, etc. every person in a democratic society needs to stand up for what they feel is right. If you feel that it is wrong that fraud is happening, go ahead attempt to make a difference, you&#x27;ll make the NEWS as well.<p>The reason that this is making NEWS is that these kids are willing to stand up for themselves even if it gets them kicked out of school (which by the way is not exactly a minuscule event).<p>It seems to me that you are attempting to compare a dispute amongst intellectuals with the rabbles of society. This is not a fair comparison, the fact is you are right everything you listed should get the attention they deserve and believe it or not they do. Would you really like to sit on Hacker News and just read about rapes all day, or plagiarism? It is not NEWS because there is little that can be done, we have systems in place (and continue to improve systems) to minimize &quot;bad behavior.&quot;<p>In this case, Yale is actually abusing those systems (in many peoples eyes) and that is why it is making NEWS. Yale has an issue with seemingly abusing its power, this in my opinion, is wrong for the same reasons as rape, fraud, bribery, or plagiarism, it reduces our freedoms and &quot;cheats&quot; us. In this case, the ones being cheated are the Yale students, in the case of plagiarism it&#x27;s perhaps the company that hires the plagiarizing student (or the student body when he fails at his job).<p>My point, is that you are so quick to make the assertion that this is a &quot;minuscule altercation&quot; without truly taking the time to consider that each altercation such as this is a battle for ones personal freedoms (similar to battling against plagiarism, bribery, fraud, or rape<i></i>).<p><i></i> I do consider rape a far more extreme version of reducing ones freedom, but it is still so horrible because it takes away choice and in turn ones freedom.",1390151016

Because of inflation the cost of the mortgage will go down and after 30yrs it will be a lot cheaper. As a practical example, my family purchased a house 20yrs ago.

It&#x27;s nothing but bad metaphors, questionable analogies, confused reasoning, and unfounded assertions all muddled together into what seemingly purports to be some kind of defense of the value of low-wage, low-skill, manual-labor work.<p>WTF?<p>The author assumes that anything somebody could &quot;love&quot; must be something &quot;creative&quot; and must be intellectual work... ignoring even the possibility that some people actually do love their manual jobs. Oh sure, they might wish they made more money, or wish they had more freedom and flexibility, and that might drive them to change jobs... but that doesn&#x27;t mean that some people don&#x27;t enjoy farming or working in factories or what-have-you.<p>The author also seems to assume a society based on Plato&#x27;s idea that your career is picked for you at birth, and where you aren&#x27;t allowed to change.  But clearly we don&#x27;t live in that world.  If you&#x27;re working on a factory floor, and <i>hate</i> it, then &quot;DWYL&quot; is an <i>aspiration</i> - a reason to work a little harder, volunteer for extra shifts, save more aggressively, and do whatever it takes to enable you to escape the factory floor and create the opportunity to &quot;DWYL&quot;.<p>I could go on, but what&#x27;s the point?

7084970,comment,7084400,7084400,12,0,bane,,,"The numbers here are weird at least in my area, so it&#x27;s hard to compare. But in general, in most places, over a 30 year comparison, buying is better than renting unless you get very lucky with your alternative investment decisions.<p>A couple things to add, house payments stay exactly the same over a very long time. They don&#x27;t increase <i>at all</i>. The absolute dollar amount is fixed. So while rent in an area might triple over 30 years due to inflation and local housing market fluctuations, mortgage payments don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s a time-value of money idea. It&#x27;s cheaper to buy now than later.<p>Most people buy or rent homes where the monthly payment is at around 1/3 of their take-home income. As a home owner, that percentage decreases as your pay increases (inflation, pay raises, promotions, etc.).<p>What makes the decision difficult is the cost of servicing a loan vs. just paying for rent. [1]<p>The problem is that, even with a low interest rate, you pay <i>a lot</i> of extra money towards interest. A $500,000 home with a 3% 30 year loan costs something like $750,000 in the end. You can effectively lower your rate by artificially paying down your principle. If you view the monthly payment as a <i>minimum</i> monthly payment, just pay extra and pay down the principle faster. One simple way to do it, as your income grows, just keep paying 33% of your take home pay towards your mortgage. If you get a big bonus, pay that as well. Most mortgages don&#x27;t have a limit to how much you can pay in a month. Doing this will reduce the effective interest rate, lower the minimum required payment, and shorten the length of the loan. Even better, during months where you need lots of fluid cash, just pay the then minimum payment and different you were paying is now usable. It&#x27;s like giving yourself a pay raise if you need one.<p>Also, when interest rates drop, you can refinance and otherwise change the terms of your loan to be more favorable. You can turn equity into large sums of cash almost on demand if you need to. You can&#x27;t do any of that as a renter.<p>After a few years, if you run the numbers, you&#x27;ll probably find that you  can comfortably service a shorter-term loan, say a 15-year loan. Which also have lower interest rates than 30 year.<p>As a quick example, my &quot;minimum&quot; mortgage payment + amortized property tax is about $1500 less per month than the current market rental rate for a similar sized home.<p>In the end, once you finally own your house, all you are responsible for is upkeep and property taxes, which will be a tiny fraction of the then market rate for renting a similar sized property. You&#x27;ll likely have more income coming in by then then you&#x27;ll really know what to do with. Whereas if you had rented a similar sized property the entire time, you&#x27;ll still be renting and have nothing to show for it and you&#x27;ll be subject to the whims of your landlord.<p>I know a number of families who started out renting the house they eventually bought, but if they had just bought a house to start with would be close to owning the property instead of 10 years behind. Renting those properties bought them very little.<p>1 - Here&#x27;s a fun experiment, let&#x27;s suppose I buy a home at $500,000 with a 3.25% interest rate over 30 years. My monthly payment is $2176.03. Supposing I decided to stick with that, I&#x27;ll pay $783,370 for the house.<p>Now let&#x27;s say I rent the same property and I get lucky and it&#x27;s an even $2,000/mo or $24,000/year. But let&#x27;s say rent increases with the current rate of inflation (1.5%) for 30 years. Over that time you&#x27;ll pay $900,928.40 for the same place. And the owner of the property will now own the place you live in and have made $117k off of you. Inflation rarely stays at 1.5% though, so let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s a more normal rate of 3%. Well now you&#x27;ve paid 1,141,809.977 for somebody else&#x27;s to own their property. In other words, they&#x27;ll have made $358k off of you and gotten a house of out it.<p>In fact, the property owner is probably just taking the increase in payment and paying down the principle even faster like I propose above.<p>2 - Here is an awesome tool that sort of shows my point <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calculator.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/business/buy-rent-calcula...</a> In my notional example, buying is better at around 6 years.<p>3 - and another one somebody else mentioned <a href=""http://www.trulia.com/rent_vs_buy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trulia.com/rent_vs_buy/</a> in my notional example, buying is almost 1/3rd cheaper than renting over 30 years.",1390150800
