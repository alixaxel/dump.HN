That assurance is possible because the code is maintained and distributed through Git, a source-code management system that allows developers and users to maintain independent copies all over the Internet.

7003853,comment,7000686,7002813,4,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Really, the issue is straightforward: did the person accessing the information have a reasonable belief that they were authorized to access it?<p>The inherent flaw in this interpretation is that it uses a self-referential definition of authorization. Saying &quot;access is authorized if it is reasonable to believe that access is authorized&quot; is meaningless. You would need an independent definition of authorized access in order to evaluate the reasonableness of the belief, which defeats the purpose of using it to define authorization.<p>Where a &quot;reasonable belief&quot; standard makes sense is in determining <i>intent</i>, not in establishing the definition of an element of the crime. For example, it may be illegal for you to steal my laptop (where the definition of the elements of theft are fairly rigorous), but if it turns out that you have exactly the same model of laptop and &quot;reasonably believed&quot; mine to be yours then even though you objectively stole my laptop, the prosecution may not be able to prove that you intended to.<p>But &quot;authorization&quot; is clearly not about intent. The alleged perpetrator is not the one permitted to define the scope of authorization, so their intent is irrelevant in determining whether the access was in fact authorized, and the intent of the owner of the computer system is also irrelevant because it isn&#x27;t reasonable to subject a defendant to the intent of a third party if that third party fails to clearly articulate it. What matters instead is what has been articulated -- the information made available to users of the computer system about what level of access is permitted.<p>But then we&#x27;re back to the terms of service trouble again. If you allow contractual restrictions to define authorization then you&#x27;re allowing corporations to define the contours of a federal felony and anyone who lies about their name on Facebook can be thrown in prison at the whim of an overzealous prosecutor. Conversely, relying on technological authorization makes the law extremely narrow (capturing only the likes of perpetrators who defeat technological denials of authorization via e.g. physical intrusion into the victim&#x27;s data center -- although that <i>would</i> align better with the established penalties). Neither seems particularly satisfactory, and the reason is that &quot;unauthorized access&quot; is the wrong thing to prohibit. &quot;Authorization&quot; is vague and subjective, and the specifics of a violation span such a wide range of conduct and misconduct that lumping them all together under the same set of penalties is all but guaranteed to violate proportionality unless the penalties are set so low as to make the prohibition nominal.<p>And I still don&#x27;t understand what useful purpose it serves as distinguished from the already-existing penalties for vandalism, fraud, misappropriation of trade secrets, etc. etc. If someone engages in access without authorization, <i>without more</i>, the warranted level of punishment is minimal and almost never even worth prosecuting. If they engage in some further malicious act then the penalty for the greater crime can be imposed and unauthorized access is only a side show and a dangerous instrument of prosecutorial overreach. When is it ever supposed to be useful in proportion to the controversy and abuse it produces?",1388716603

That is, when are you more productive? Working really long hours each week? Working short hours?<p>I can see arguments for either sides.<p>For working longer hours, Elon Musk has said many times telling people to work like hell. I recently saw an interview where he says if you&#x27;re working for Tesla expect to put in > 50 hour work weeks. And he&#x27;s extremely successful. Another argument I see is that in Silicon Valley there is a culture of working long hours. Silicon Valley is extremely successful at pumping out new technology. I read some comments in the &quot;Vacations are for the weak&quot; thread and there were posts saying how in the European countries there is much more vacation time mandated by the government. But they don&#x27;t have successful startup hubs.<p>On the other hand, working shorter hours prevents burnout. It keeps you refreshed. I think there&#x27;s a little bit of research that found that longer work hours = more productivity in blue collar work but not necessarily in white collar work. I think I recall some startup raising money despite working 4 day weeks or something like that, an outlier for sure.<p>What are your experiences with this? Is there science and research behind this?",1388716089

The Commotion-router repo above is contains our setup scripts that make it easier for new users like you to build our software from source. If you look at the feeds.conf file you will find the exact sources we are pulling in to the openWRT build system for compilation. The most important line, for your concerns about backdoors would be the third line of that file. That line  pulls in the master branch of the repo commotion-feed. This repository is full of makefiles. These makefiles specify how to build the source code into the compiled binary your pointed to before. If you follow the follow the install instructions that were poster earlier and then explore the curses (command line GUI) menu for make menuconfig you can explore the exactly what packages are going to be built for the specific architecture. (If you are curious about tampering we sadly have not had the time or funding to do deterministic builds, so I suggest you build it from source yourself so that you can examine the code.) Now, each item in the menuconfig references a &quot;feed.&quot; You can look at the feeds.conf file in the current directory, and the various makefiles in the feeds folder to explore where exactly things are being pulled from. Our source code will use the git repo&#x27;s specified in the makefiles in commotion-feed on the master branch. You can find all of those in our github, because we are an open-source project. If you have any concerns about specific lines of code that have been implemented I beg of you to submit a bug to the repo you find a problem with. We want every possible opportunity better our code. While we have done internal testing, I hope that with eyes like yours looking over the code we will find more bugs that we can address in the future. If you have any questions I will try to follow this thread the best I can, and am elationfoundation on github. You can also find most of the developers and our field experts on freenode at #commotion. I have built, and debugged, far too many openWRT images. So, If you do need assistance jump on #commotion during Americas East Coast working hours and I will be glad to help you.<p>I hope this helped.

In Ancient Greek, the concept of singular and plural were joined distinctly by the concept of pair, which exists currently in no language that I can think of (and certainly isn&#x27;t popular if it exists). In English, nouns are not explicitly marked to indicate role in the sentence (left up to ordering and ultimately subjective, implicit interpretation), which is easily taken care of in other languages like German, Russian and Hungarian with a case system. Hell, English doesn&#x27;t even have a stand-alone future tense (i.e., a verb conjugation) ...how exactly can we make any argument for a universal grammar, when there exists so many grammatical concepts in other languages that aren&#x27;t actually possible in any explicit sense even in English? If I&#x27;ve misunderstood your usage of the phrase &quot;Universal Grammar&quot;, I apologize for my ignorance.",1388715068

Klein proposed a data-centric side project along the lines/ like all-things D, but Bezos and Sr Mgmnt appear to have turned him down. Presumably he&#x27;s having talks with parties in SF who have more interest and the cash on hand to build something. Given ATD&#x27;s parting of the ways with WSJ, it&#x27;s an interesting data point as to whether the model is a failure for the parent/strategy, in that it dilutes the brand, power, and control of central masthead publisher. Or if its just an un-tenable biz model. The difference with Klein is that he&#x27;s a bit younger than ATD and probably has more room to run in developing something new-er-ish.<p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/20/ezra-klein-washington-post-new-venture_n_4481314.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/20/ezra-klein-washingt...</a>",1388715057

I really like that the board can accept a high current power source and has a cutoff switch.<p>I am always a little nervous about building a robot around a board when I am uncertain about how it will be supported.  If you are really building robots that are going to be used out doors or in rugged environments you want to be able to replace every part.  Controller boards aren&#x27;t really the expensive part of robots.<p>For Decapitron, an autonomous combat robot (<a href""http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php/140197-Decapitron"" rel""nofollo"">http://forums.parallax.com/showthread.php/140197-Decapitron!</a>), I have had to replace the controller board twice.  That may sound like a lot but shorts and power surges aren&#x27;t that strange in combat.  But now that board isn&#x27;t made anymore.  So it is a big problem if the board gets damaged in combat. That&#x27;s the advantage of using something really standard, like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.  I can get one of those next year.<p>Still, I will try this.",1388714996
