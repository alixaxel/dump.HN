Many large tech companies reside in SV and the Bay Area including Oracle, Apple, HP, Google and Intel. It could be argued that these companies are so large at this point that they have cultural effect on the surrounding communities. In tech right now, the largest competitive advantage is good engineers because almost everything else has become easy to obtain thanks to the internet. In order to compete with SV, you may need to duplicate the cultural effect that SV created, and that isn&#x27;t happening anywhere else on the same level right now.

The potential payoffs are lower, it is true, but the freedom is higher, and the security is better in many cases.

7005974,comment,7001747,7005669,1,0,jp555,,,"> Does an increased insulin load, coupled with insulin resistance caused by long-term exposure to chronically high insulin levels, promote greater fat storage?<p>> And does this greater mass of fat, which itself is a hormonally active organ, affect the body in a way that results in illness and further weight gain?<p>These are very good questions. Here&#x27;s what I know (caveat it may not be complete, but I am confident it is accurate):<p>1: Hmm, chronically high insulin levels is caused by chronically eating too much. Beef spikes insulin just as much as table sugar (<a href""http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/66/5/1264.full.pdf#page=1&view=Fit"" rel""nofollo"">http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/66/5/1264.full.pdf#page=1&...</a>). So I would say the problem of &quot;chronically high insulin levels&quot; is a problem of eating too much food, not too much sugar.<p>2: This is a hugely interesting area of thinking for me. Which fat though? White or brown adipose tissue? Brown fat is darker in colour due to it&#x27;s huge cellular density of mitochondria when compared to white adipose tissue. It&#x27;s essential fat-buringing fat, and plays a role in regulating temperature. It basically burns fat to warm us up when we&#x27;re cold. This is why Michael Phelps can eat 10 million calories a day. 6 hours a day in water requires allocating a LOT of calories to maintain core body temp. We have learned SO much about fat tissue recently, but I don&#x27;t think we have all the answers yet.<p>I noticed this red-flag from the thought-experiment:<p>> We know the liver will turn some of this fructose into fat and if the fructose is delivered quickly<p>Yep, but less than 1% is converted into fat (<a href""http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/9/1/8"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.nutritionandmetabolism.com/content/9/1/89</a>), and this is in a state of caloric surplus. The thought-experiment method is for the subjects to eat calories to match their TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure), so it&#x27;s much more likely that none of this fructose will be converted into fat, it&#x27;s more likely to completely  converted into glucose by the liver.<p>> Let’s assume two things for the sake of argument.  the sugar in A’s diet causes A to become insulin resistant. And second, insulin works to put fat in fat tissue.<p>I would say both assumptions are fallacious. Eating @ TDEE means 100% of the food energy is used up, and fat cannot be made from nothing. More sugar in this case does not cause insulin resistance, beef stimulates insulin release into the blood just as much as sugar does, so one can&#x27;t isolate a single macronutrient like that. Also, the &quot;insulin works to put fat in fat tissue&quot; is misleading at best and completely wrong at worst, depending on how you interpret it. Insulin works to move nutrients into cells. More insulin in the blood is a signal there is food calories available, so insulin also stops fat cells from releasing their fat. This makes total sense; why dip into your savings when you just got a fist full of cash? The point where your body transitions towards fat storage is the point where your energy intake exceed energy expenditure; again just simply eating less solves this.<p>My statements are all for average healthy people. I totally agree metabolic-syndromes like diabetes should be treated differently. But the VAST majority of people are fat because they sustain consuming more energy than they use. The micro-variables like how stressed you are (and therefor how much cortisol hormone is present) matter, but nothing gets diet-induced hormones working as they should better (in healthy people) by just eating food-energy (whatever the macros) to match your activity over the long run.",1388764165

If the db is enforcing users&#x27; security (which would be the case if you want to share security logic across apps possibly written in different languages) and it is an internal app with limited numbers of users, this makes a lot of sense.  For a public internet site, however, it makes very little sense (since you likely have lots of users with essentially the same permissions).<p>In LedgerSMB, for example, we use app login credentials as db credentials for internal users, but for customer/vendor portals, we use a single user account for the portal.  There are a lot of reasons for this but PostgreSQL is flexible enough one can (relatively easily) limit most users to the LedgerSMB app if one wants (via pg_hba.conf).  The goal however is to allow non-web apps with the same credentials and security enforcement and we already have some of those.<p>So it isn&#x27;t necessarily a facepalm.  It <i>really</i> depends on context.  There can be valid reasons for it but those are not in the context of a public-facing web site.  I.e. if you expect users only to access the db through <i>a single app</i> then you don&#x27;t want to use it but if you want the db to be accessed through <i>a group of apps</i> then using the db as a SSO technology is actually pretty smart.",1388763676

7005851,comment,7005649,7005649,17,0,programminggeek,,,"I think there is a subtle, but important thing that the author is missing because, while objectively, PHP as a turing complete language(I believe) you can write basically anything in PHP both good or bad, there is the question of what the language/framework/tools/community allows for or encourages.<p>In the earlier days of PHP, it was incredibly common to build SQL via strings and nobody thought too much about it. Over time things have evolved and a million little frameworks have sprouted up and it&#x27;s less of a problem, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that PHP doesn&#x27;t have a terrible history behind it of a community not knowing or caring as much about security as they should.<p>Then, there is the fact that php files just sit on the server and can be executed arbitrarily by just navigating to that file. That is a real security problem in the case that someone is able to upload a php file to a machine. Yes, I know a lot of frameworks make this harder to do now, but by default apache/php lets you do this and you could argue it&#x27;s one of the real strengths of PHP(ease of deployment).<p>Last, because PHP is the biggest language it is the biggest target, which means that writing secure code is that much more important. So many PHP projects are open source, so if a vulnerability is found and you don&#x27;t upgrade your Wordpress or Drupal or Joomla or Magento or phpBB or whatever else app you are running, your site is very likely to be compromised just because you aren&#x27;t staying up to date with updates, and A LOT of people don&#x27;t update their software, systems, or packages like they should.<p>So, PHP from a purely objective standpoint might be as secure as anything else, but the human factors surrounding PHP make it a lot worse in my opinion than other languages/platforms/frameworks from a security standpoint.",1388762965

Distribution of word length can give you insight into how deep a fast lexical lookup tree (trie) needs to be to capture most words. After that depth, you can fall back on a more memory efficient, but slower, structure like a hashtable.<p>In this case: at a depth of 6, a trie can handle ~75% of all words. At 5 it can handle ~67%. Since tries can grow exponentially in memory (fully populated), reducing a level and still getting about a 70% solution might be good enough.   It&#x27;s about an 8% reduction in the size of the representable lexicon. However if you go to length 4, you can only cover ~56% of words. Meaning there&#x27;s a 45% chance that a given word won&#x27;t be stored in the trie.<p>Supposing we set a desired metric that the trie needs to handle 70% of all words, then depth 5 is pretty reasonable and space efficient with only a 1/3 chance that a word that in our lexicon won&#x27;t be in the trie.",1388762678
