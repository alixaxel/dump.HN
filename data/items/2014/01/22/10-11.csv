7101838,comment,7100394,7101092,3,0,trevelyan,,,"What are you talking about? This is what Krugman actually had to say about Argentina in 2001:<p>&quot;Argentina entered the new century in straits similar to those of a disquieting number of European counties today. With the peso shackled to the dollar, it had (as Greece, Spain, and the other so-called PIIGS on the periphery of the Eurozone do today) what appeared to be an irremediably overvalued currency sapping the competitiveness of its exports, along with mounting difficulties servicing its debt as tax receipts dwindled in the face of recession. The counsel of the IMF was naturally for austerity. The Argentines should maintain dollar convertibility—that is, a pricey currency—and trim public expenditure in order to cover interest payments. . . . [Yet] austerity in the face of gigantic indebtedness . . . yielded precisely the devaluation and default it was supposed to prevent. If the Argentine experience is truly as exemplary as the IMF once maintained, the story can’t be a heartening one in light of the turn toward austerity today being undertaken in Europe and threatened in the US.&quot;<p>In contrast, the Forbes article is entirely unclear. It fails to explain the key point that the IMF was not just advocating depreciation, but was pushing for the sort of restrictive government austerity that has been forced on Greece.<p>&quot;it’s also difficult to see quite what is unorthodox or heterodox about following the standard IMF prescription for a country in such problems. Default, renegotiate the debt burden and devalue the currency to try and spark an export boom.&quot;<p>Krugman&#x27;s point is simple and stands. A simple comparison of Argentina&#x27;s GDP growth post-2001 with Greek growth post-2008 shows this plainly enough: one economy recovered quickly and the other is still sinking.",1390386487

The names are a common vocabulary shared between the designer/implementer and user/client of the code; and as yason says, if you choose your abstractions at an appropriate level, you can &quot;talk about&quot; (or describe/define) the problem+solution in terms that are best suited to the problem+solution.<p>And to note one more benefit of short functions: When you&#x27;re talking about functions (operations) and classes (encapsulated state), you rely upon these abstractions to behave in a certain way.  Shorter functions and simpler classes generally have fewer moving parts, thus making it easier to verify the correctness of the implementation of the abstraction concept.",1390386411

It has advantages for you to understand the difference between &quot;unit test&quot; and &quot;regression test&quot;. It also has advantages to understand the difference between &quot;active income&quot;, &quot;passive income&quot;, and &quot;portfolio income&quot;. For once you can speak with professionals without misunderstandings, and you can think about a topic in a different way. When you understand what &quot;passive income&quot; means you will see, that you actually really like &quot;passive income&quot; from a tax paying point of view, even if you have to work as hard for it as you would for your &quot;active income&quot; (e.g., salary).

I&#x27;ll just link to a stackoverflow answer I made on the subject several years back: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/785145/one-line-functions-in-c/785217#785217"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/785145/one-line-functions...</a><p>Summary: Performance almost certainly isn&#x27;t an issue (compilers are smart). Abstraction leads to better design, using a well-named function can improve readability, making it easier to understand, easier to prove correct, and easier to modify. When you keep code inline it increases the inertia of the given design and implementation, extracting even a single line into a function (when warranted) can make it far easier to drastically change implementation. And if you want that single line of code to become several lines, or to switch to calling out to a web service, implement caching, add error checking or what-have-you that&#x27;s made much easier when it&#x27;s encapsulated inside a function than when it&#x27;s sitting inside a block.<p>Componentization is always good, even when the components are sometimes very small. Like all design choices extracting code into its own function requires judgment based on experience but when done right it can have many benefits, even when it&#x27;s a single line, even when it&#x27;s a fraction of a single line.<p>Blindly following a rule such as avoiding making functions too small is just as big an error as avoiding making functions too large.",1390385094
