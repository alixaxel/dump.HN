For instance, taking your line about weird foods and flipping the sentences yields this:<p>My sentence structure is almost always question first then statement, not the best form, but one that seems to come naturally to me. I&#x27;ll work on flipping it around!<p>Then again I enjoy abuse of English in general, one the sign offs to a message I sent went as such:<p><i>With the names of artists hanging in the air, I shall end this message, with hopes of hearing a reply.</i><p>(That one did get a reply!)<p>I have done other hideous things on OKC as well, including getting into a short story writing contest with an English teacher one time.

If you split your code in functions and, instead, start <i>talking</i> in the language you&#x27;ve just invented then you&#x27;re composing a program. And I think compilers should do the building while I refrain myself to composing.<p>Of course, one-line functions don&#x27;t have inherent value but sometimes they&#x27;re needed. For example, to present a higher-level concept that just effectively happens to be a simple assignment or an inc.<p>Short functions themselves don&#x27;t have an inherent value either: if you manage to write your function with less tokens, possibly due to composing it out of other functions, then that&#x27;s all good but isn&#x27;t the real value of doing it. Shortness for the sake of shortness only matters until you&#x27;re down to a screenful or so.<p>The real value of defining and writing functions is thinking of the proper words for your language. As soon as you&#x27;re making your own language, then you&#x27;re just using functions as vehicles to represent words in that language. Some words might take 30 lines to code, some words might take 3 lines. It doesn&#x27;t matter as you&#x27;ve got your language together in a way that is concise and beautiful which is the real point.",1390384285

7101726,comment,7098794,7099859,1,0,epsylon,,,"It&#x27;s good to have plans for big charitable actions, but small actions can make a difference too. Even if you give only 100$ or 50$ per year (and 100$ is close to a rounding error on your yearly income), it can still go a long way for some charities. Charities in general need money all the time, and their work is easier if they can rely on a steady flow rather than big sporadic gifts (which require them to invest part of the money they get into fundraising - that&#x27;s also why small monthly donations are better).<p>It&#x27;s also super easy to help, you just need to donate a small amount of cash. You don&#x27;t have to invest any of your time or to think and plan deeply about it. The advantage of small donations over large donations is that you don&#x27;t have the same emotional attachment to how well spent your donation is gonna be. (Just investigate briefly which organizations support causes which you care about and look into how well-managed their funds are - usually most of these organizations are pretty transparent, and consistently managed over the years. So you can pick a few favorites and give to them blindly afterwards.)<p>One big advantage of numerous small donations is also that you can contribute to many causes you are attached to without having to &quot;choose one&quot;. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, I give to food banks, emergency relief organizations, human & digital rights associations, and environmental protection associations, because I find all these causes to be important.",1390384052

7101700,comment,7097254,7101523,1,0,obstacle1,,,"1. I&#x27;m kind of unclear on why you quoted me the way you did. I didn&#x27;t actually say that most feminism has a tenuous grasp on reality, I said exactly what you later quoted me as saying (&quot;often (not always!)&quot;). Yeah, it introduces antagonism, but it isn&#x27;t, in my view, unwarranted. It&#x27;s hard to have an argument without some antagonism.<p>2. If you really want to take that path, then yes, there&#x27;s systemic <i>something</i> at play by virtue of the fact that the male-female distribution isn&#x27;t always uniform across human activities. Is it marginalization? That isn&#x27;t a given. You take it as a given.<p>e.g. 99.9% of women can have babies, 100% of men cannot. Is that marginalization? Or just systemic? 76% of US public school teachers are female. Is that marginalization, or just systemic? About 20% of congress/senate are female, 80% are male. Marginalization? Or just systemic? 92.2% of Federal inmates in the US are male, 7.8% are female. Put another way: <i>one out of every eighteen men in America is locked up in a Federal pen</i>. Is that marginalization? Or just systemic? [1][2][3]<p><i>Once again</i>, my gripe is mainly with the type of feminism I <i>originally, way back</i> responded to. The kind that says we can&#x27;t have men&#x27;s groups because &quot;every other group is a men&#x27;s group&quot;.<p><i>And again again again</i>, I <i>don&#x27;t</i> have a problem with fighting female marginalization where it occurs. I have a problem with groups who say we should fight female marginalization and ignore men entirely because men aren&#x27;t marginalized. That&#x27;s bullshit, and needs to be fought vocally and persistently wherever it is encountered. Men need advocacy too, and groups who say otherwise are, frankly, an enemy to justice as far as I&#x27;m concerned.<p>3. Point taken.<p>4. Great, but I&#x27;m not advocating anyone to take some predefined MRA position and set it in opposition to feminism. I absolutely agree that often (not always!) MRA groups are victims of the exact same ideology-induced blindness that I&#x27;m complaining about in some feminisms.<p>Why I linked those articles is because they lay out events that objectively did occur where feminist groups or institutions actively tried blocking men from discussing men&#x27;s issues. The men&#x27;s groups that applied for funding at UoT and Ryerson had nothing to do with these controversial positions you&#x27;re talking about. The instigators of the men&#x27;s group at Ryerson included two women.<p>About the posters. If you&#x27;re referring to the &quot;just because you regret a one-night stand doesn&#x27;t mean it wasn&#x27;t consensual&quot; one, I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s slut-shaming. It&#x27;s turning a City of Calgary/Battered Women&#x27;s Support Services campaign&#x27;s own logic around. Their posters said stuff like &quot;just because she&#x27;s drinking doesn&#x27;t mean she wants sex&quot;. If the men&#x27;s rights poster implies that women are sluts, then the City&#x27;s poster implies that men are rapists. <i>That&#x27;s the point</i>. The drinking poster implies that all men are potential rapists; the one-night stand poster implies that all women are potential liars. Heads, meet tails.<p>Nobody wants to think about that one logically, though. People just want to react.<p>5. Yeah, and really I&#x27;m just pointing that out.<p>6. Point taken.<p>7. Well, if people want to react to what I&#x27;m saying that&#x27;s fine. I&#x27;m equipped to handle that. I&#x27;m obviously not making these posts to have people <i>not</i> engage me in argument. It&#x27;s <i>having</i> the argument that is important, imo.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand what kind of warning bells &quot;men need advocates too&quot; claims would set off, and forgive me if after reading your posts I don&#x27;t see <i>what</i> in your posts should have illuminated that for me.
