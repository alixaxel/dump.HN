7016813,comment,7015132,7015132,21,0,temuze,,,"This is a great article. It&#x27;s pretty fun to play around with this heuristic:<p><pre><code>  lambda c: 3*len(matches(c, uncovered)) - len(c)\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s a trivial way to explore it: say we generalize the heuristic to H(a, b).<p><pre><code>  H(a,b) = lambda c: a*len(matches(c, uncovered)) - b*len(c)\n</code></pre>\nThe original heuristic is considered H(3,1) by this definition. Then we can play around with a and b to see if we&#x27;d get smaller results.<p><pre><code>  def findregex_lambda(winners, losers, a, b):\n      &quot;Find a regex that matches all winners but no losers (sets of strings).&quot;\n      # Make a pool of candidate components, then pick from them to cover winners.\n      # On each iteration, add the best component to &#x27;cover&#x27;; finally disjoin them together.\n      pool = candidate_components(winners, losers)\n      cover = []\n      while winners:\n          best = max(pool, key=lambda c: a*len(matches(c, winners)) - b*len(c))\n          cover.append(best)\n          pool.remove(best)\n          winners = winners - matches(best, winners)\n      return &#x27;|&#x27;.join(cover)\n\n  >>> findregex_lambda(starwars, startrek, 3, 1)\n  &#x27; T|E.P| N&#x27;\n  >>> findregex_lambda(starwars, startrek, 3, 2)\n  &#x27; T|B| N| M&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nOr, to automate this:<p><pre><code>  def best_H_heuristic(winners, losers):\n      d = {(a,b) : len(findregex_lambda(winners, losers, a,b)) for a in range(0,4) for b in range(0,4)}\n      return min(d, key=d.get)\n\n  >>> best_H_heuristic(starwars, startrek):\n  (3,1)\n</code></pre>\nLooks like H(3,1) is pretty good for this case. What about the nfl teams?<p><pre><code>  >>> best_H_heuristic(nfl_in, nfl_out)\n  (3, 2)\n  >>> findregex_lambda(nfl_in, nfl_out, 3, 1)\n  &#x27;pa|g..s|4|fs|sa|se|lt|os&#x27;\n  >>> findregex_lambda(nfl_in, nfl_out, 3, 2)\n  &#x27;pa|ch|4|e.g|sa|se|lt|os&#x27;\n</code></pre>\nNot the best heuristic there. H(3,1) wins or ties for the boys/girls set, left/right set and drugs/cities set, which just goes to show you that picking a heuristic off a gut guess isn&#x27;t such a bad approach.<p>You could also explore heuristics of different forms:<p><pre><code>  M(a,b,d,e) = lambda c: a*len(matches(c, uncovered))^b - d*len(c)^e\n</code></pre>\nOr trying completely different formats:<p><pre><code>  L(a,b) = lambda c: a*log(len(matches(c, uncovered))) - b*len(c)</code></pre>",1389095921

With consoles you have the idea that with that unit you can play everything. With a steam machine is different. I&#x27;d like a &quot;with version A you can play X, with version B you can play X+Y, with version C you can play X+Y and have 3D&quot;...<p>This is nowadays already not much of a problem. If you build a mid-high end PC now, you can expect it to play every game at least at reasonable settings for the next couple of years. How long it&#x27;s going to hold is always a bit of speculation, but you can get hardware reccomendations from certain magazines or websites.<p>The same is true for the games&#x27; side. If I buy a new game, gaming magazines/websites will tell you how much CPU, GPU, RAM you need to play it on minimal, medium, and maximal settings (the hardware requirements on the boxes are usually rubbish, unfortunately). They usually also say something like &quot;works fine if you&#x27;ve built your PC in the last 3 years&quot;. You don&#x27;t need to match the specs exactly, because games have gotten pretty good at automatically adjusting settings.<p>So it works now, but it&#x27;s only going to get easier with Steam machines. You&#x27;ll probably see games advertized as &quot;Works great with 2015 steam boxes. Best effects with a 2016 steam box, or AMD Radeon OMG9000. Minimal requirements: 2014 steam box or equivalent (Intel Core i5 xxxx, 8 GB RAM, ...).&quot;<p>If I were them, I&#x27;d either have yearly revisions, or hardware levels. So in 2014, a low-end will be HW level 5, a mid-end will be level 6, and a high-end will be level 7. One year later, a new high-end will maybe be level 9. Games would then just say you need a level 7 PC to run (very much like the windows hardware index, except PC&#x27;s will be built to reach a certain number).",1389094843

Isolating these machines from outside vibrations as well as canceling out their own internal harmonics is no small engineering feat and typically involves pouring a concrete slab custom for the setup. Beyond keeping up export restrictions and avoiding bad installations I can see it as a way of avoiding warranty fraud with user error or crane accidents.",1389092915

7016625,comment,7015968,7016588,9,0,dageshi,,,"I was watching a gaming podcast the other day and someone made a good point, if valve were to go aggressively after console users with the steambox right now at the start of a new console round they&#x27;d be setting themselves up for a world of hurt. Microsoft/Sony could deliberately pay off developers to hold up the PC version of games for 6+ months after console releases. If you can&#x27;t play the latest and greatest that would significantly drop the value of a steambox.<p>So instead, release a steambox version which is only going to be popular with &quot;enthusiasts&quot;, bug/beta test the hell out of them and then more aggressively market steamboxes in 2-5 years time when the current console generation is starting to look old.<p>Valve are playing a long game here I think, the value proposition of a steambox isn&#x27;t going to make sense until we&#x27;re about half way through the current console cycle.",1389092717

I was thinking of a cheap steam machine (300/400 $) to play indie games and game about 4 years old, a medium spec&#x27;d machine for about 700 $ that can play everything in the market, and a 1500 $ machine with high specs.<p>Still, one of the great points in PCs is the variety of hardware.<p>I&#x27;m just curious on how Valve (or the HW vendors) are gonna market it. With consoles you have the idea that with that unit you can play everything. With a steam machine is different. I&#x27;d like a &quot;with version A you can play X, with version B you can play X+Y, with version C you can play X+Y and have 3D&quot;...<p>I don&#x27;t care too much for graphics, so hardware specs don&#x27;t speak too much for me.
