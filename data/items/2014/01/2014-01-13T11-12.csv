Unions are constrained on what they can do. I can threaten to stop working unless my employer stops purchasing from a company with a horrible safety record, where the employees of the other company are on strike as protest. We&#x27;re both agreed on that, right?<p>But do it collectively - say, 90% of my fellow 4,000 employees threaten to stop working in support of the workers of the other company - and suddenly it&#x27;s labeled a union and our actions considered an illegal sympathy strike.<p>I can&#x27;t help but conclude that the legal constraints on what a union can do mean that it can&#x27;t fully participate in a free market. Instead, the &#x27;free market&#x27; you&#x27;re talking about is actually &#x27;the market where collective action freedoms have been deliberately handicapped.&#x27;<p>(Personally I think there must be constraints on a free market, but that&#x27;s a different conversation.)<p>&quot;if the factory owner can fire all of the union workers during a strike&quot;<p>Why can the factory owner do that? Surely the union contract would prohibit mass firing during a strike. Otherwise, as you say, what&#x27;s the point of having a union?<p>In the context of US law, there are certain things that an employer is prohibited from doing. Mass firing of legally striking employees is one of them. Even non-union ones.

He has seen your passion and drive 100s of other times before. He decides to give you $200K as seed money so you can keep getting same income as your corporate cushy job. He knows your chance of failure is 90%. Next year very likely investor is going to loose <i>all</i> of that money.<p>On the other hand, you have no downside. For you, it&#x27;s pretty much the change of job because you get to keep same income as before. In fact, it&#x27;s much better than a change of job because now you get to work on stuff <i>you</i> want in your pajamas in your backyard of your 4 bedroom home. Come next year, there is 90% probability that your startup would have failed. But you would have zero loss in any material respect. Instead most likely you are just going to move on with your life and find another corporate cushy job with minor or even major promotion given that now you can brag about having tried your own startup and claim that experience.<p>So you see, we have a transaction where one party has 90% chance of loosing everything and other party gains 110% <i>always</i>. Anyone fantasizing about such transaction would have to find a great fool or <i>own</i> a casino. This is why you can&#x27;t expect any competent investor funding your startup so you get to keep your &quot;cushy job&quot; income.<p>PS: Betting your &quot;name&quot; and &quot;reputation&quot; is meaningless to investors unless you are Evan Williams or Kevin Rose.<p>PS2: If you think investors are still getting fair deal because they have chance of hitting a jackpot, know this: Average VC fund has less returns than S&P 500.

You did a PhD to become a scientist and enter the (metaphorical but real) Guild of Scientists spread throughout academia and industry, with steady, salaried employment as a Guild member reasonably assured.<p>People who were planning to make their own way got bachelors degrees, people who planned to teach got Masters degrees, and people who planned to research got PhDs.<p>Now, you can of course keep repeating &quot;<i>make your own way</i>, you dumb ignoramus who doesn&#x27;t understand market imperatives!&quot; until the cows come home, but all that means is that you consider market imperatives to override guild structure.<p>Which they have!  But a descriptive statement about how the system has come to work is not a normative statement about how it <i>should be made</i> to function.  Certainly I would say the guild structure is malfunctioning when job qualifications have gone from &quot;produce one masterpiece (a PhD) over a few years and you can get a job&quot; to &quot;produce two to three masterpieces (a PhD and one or two post-docs) over a dozen years, and then you&#x27;re considered <i>just about</i> qualified to <i>apply</i> for a permanent job&quot;.<p>By the way, we&#x27;re <i>certainly</i> not talking about my <i>personal</i> plans, since at this point I simply don&#x27;t anticipate any currently-known career structure actually lasting.

They were effectively worthless after deregulation.<p>All this was great news for consumers of course. Before deregulation it was practically impossible to get a taxi in Dublin on weekend nights. I can recall queuing for hours in the cold and wet for the privilege of being dropped home.<p>The taxi drivers mightn&#x27;t like deregulation but you can&#x27;t hold the general public to ransom by operating a closed market.

There might be some reasons for regulating taxis, but things like the medallion systems seem to have been a failure.<p>Hotels are a different matter entirely: firstly, hotels are usually already pretty correctly priced, and services are usually good (in my experience at least). Secondly, the reasons for hotel regulation are still pretty relevant:<p>- I don&#x27;t want my neighbor to sublet constantly, and have people run around. The commons (hallways and stuff) will probably get degraded, and my life will be generally shittier (see various stories about subletters).<p>- On a more maco-level, with things like rent control, subletting makes the supply even more constrained. Between getting rid of subletting and getting rid of rent control, I&#x27;d rather get rid of rent control, but in the meantime subletting is also kind of awful.<p>airbnb&#x27;s disruption is not uncontroversial",1389611217

In the past, MSN messenger, Yahoo, Google, eBay, MySpace, to name a few, all failed in competition with local China players.<p>Then why doesn&#x27;t the CCP just unblock twitter, facebook, g+, and so on? I have a hard time to believe its for reasons of porn (easy to find in the GFW) or subversion (also easy to find in the GFW). And how do you explain Facebook&#x27;s success in HK and Taiwan? People outside of China just being afraid of Chinese services? That could make sense...<p>> As for management, the biggest problem of foreign companies is that decisions especially critical ones are always made in USA, which is normally slow and ignorant.<p>The biggest problem is that we can&#x27;t play very well at all in the market. First, foreign companies have to follow all the rules very strictly: local companies have the ability to be &quot;flexible&quot; until (and if!) the government cracks down; they also don&#x27;t have to deal with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The lawyers of most foreign companies also won&#x27;t go near ambiguous China privacy and secrecy laws with a 100 ft. pole, meaning anything that deals with data or communication inside the GFW absolutely requires a local partner (say TomTom).<p>I have friends who worked or are working for local companies, and they tell stories of extreme shadiness. These are not even small no-name companies, but companies you&#x27;ve probably heard of before; I won&#x27;t name names since the foreign community that works in these companies is very small.
