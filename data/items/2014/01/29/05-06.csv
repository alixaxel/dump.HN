7142222,comment,7141532,7142187,10,0,patio11,,,"This is, ironically, one of the reasons I feel more secure with their 3-man firm than with GoDaddy.  GoDaddy has all the resources to put in place a well-architected ISOwhatever procedure with flow-charts, custom software, and government document review... and then fail at their one job.  These guys, on the other hand, pretty much will be forced to having an actual human who knows me decide &quot;Is this chap claiming to be Patrick really Patrick?&quot;  I feel really secure that a smart geek who has standing orders from me &quot;I DON&#x27;T TRANSFER DOMAIN NAMES EVER.&quot; can reason out an ad hoc verification process which is much, much more likely to reject a fraudster than the GoDaddy CSR following the manual will be.  (I mean, since they&#x27;re two degrees of separation from me and our mutual friend is a business acquaintance well known to both of us, they could literally just call the friend and say &quot;Someone is claiming to be Patrick and wants to transfer all his domains.  You know that&#x27;s a thermonuclear change since you&#x27;re in this industry too.  Call him and ask whether he knows about this.  We&#x27;d both appreciate the favor.  If he does we&#x27;re good, if he doesn&#x27;t, we&#x27;re blocking this chump.&quot;)",1390975198

But working is less and less valued in this system.<p>And with the patent system, the true inventors are getting very limited money (in big companies, it is most often just a fixed amount per patent) -- the rest of the value goes to lawyers, the companies investors and the buyers of the patents when the company goes bankrupt or looses interest. Thus creating a system, where part of the mobile phone or the software or whatever gadgets price must pay the royalties for the patent owner (not the inventor!).

But it&#x27;s necessary for their business to disqualified you and they have the right to reject serving you since the service is free on your clients side. Please don&#x27;t take it for granted that you must be served. That&#x27;s why I suggest them if they cannot afford the customer support like other decent online financial systems, they may verify on large transactions only so that they may still get the chance to serve customers with small or medium transactions, while large transaction itself can cover the service cost.<p>On the other hand, did you see there is another post directly suggesting you to have your name changed with a middle initial. Don&#x27;t think you are always 100% perfect and it&#x27;s all other people&#x27;s fault. This is another caveat in culture for the new generation. When conflict occurs, check on yourself side first.

Are you suggesting that forgoing salary shouldn&#x27;t be a substitute for thinking about your revenue model, which I&#x27;d probably agree with?  That thinking &quot;I have money in the bank, I&#x27;m fine for now&quot; makes you less hungry and less likely to take the actions you need to succeed?  That one should know when to quit and should never let dreams get in the way of facts?<p>Or are you saying that forgoing salary is always a bad idea?  If you are, how else are we supposed to start a product company?  It seems like it&#x27;s a worse idea to take investment without having done some minimal homework and prototyping to prove out the market, which usually requires at least building something you can show to customers.  It&#x27;s a very bad idea from a legal standpoint to do that work while you&#x27;re still employed by somebody else.  Consulting -> product conversions can work, but it&#x27;s often really hard to make time for product development while consulting.<p>From my own perspective - I started a &quot;founders don&#x27;t take salary&quot; company when I was 2 years out of college.  It failed miserably, predictably - it was a terrible idea to begin with, and I folded it up once I realized I was in over my head.

[1]<p>RFC 6125 [2] says that DNS-IDs should be fully qualified domain names and points you at RFC 1034 [3] for a definition (which doesn&#x27;t have a definition sadly).<p>RFC 1034 does specify the difference between complete (or absolute) domain name and a incomplete (or relative) domain name, with complete domain names including the trailing dot. As best as I can tell the first use of Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) came from RFC 1535 [4].  It doesn&#x27;t really define the term either but proceeds to use it and mentions &quot;absolute &#x27;rooted&#x27; FQDN&quot; in such a way that it implies that absolute is adjective.  Finally, we get to RFC 1594 section 5.2 [5] which tries to clear up the matter and describes a FQDN in a way that would seem to agree with your usage (requiring the trailing dot), while giving examples that omit the trailing dot.  The Wikipedia article on FQDN [6] says otherwise that the trailing dot is necessary.  So at best the definition of FQDN is ambiguous in my opinion which means the RFCs don&#x27;t help us much here with determining the proper way of handling the trailing dot with respect to PKIX certificate validation.<p>However, I think that there are some conclusions we can draw using some common sense and thinking about the implications of the behavior.<p>1) Hostnames are commonly used without the trailing dot.  As long as they only are missing the trailing dot they are still fully qualified.  They may not be absolute and are still relative to the root.<p>2) Nobody issues certificates with the trailing dot in the common name.  It doesn&#x27;t make much sense for the RFC to be defined in a way that is entirely incompatible with the existing certificates.  Especially since it went to such an effort to define how to deal with the old Common Name sytle and not only the newer SubjectAltName style.<p>Maybe they should have been using absolute hostnames in order to allow everyone to distinguish between certificates that were issued for relative domains but they don&#x27;t.  In general I don&#x27;t think CAs should be issuing certificates for relative domains.<p>Mozilla&#x27;s own CA Certificate Inclusion Policy [7] disallows certificates being issued that are not absolute domains.  It does so by saying &quot;the CA takes reasonable measures to verify that the entity submitting the certificate signing request has registered the domain(s) referenced in the certificate.&quot;  I can&#x27;t fathom how issuing a certificate based on a relative domain say &quot;www&quot; could ever be compliant with that.<p>3) What&#x27;s the worst that could happen if you allow a match on &quot;www.example.com.&quot; to the certificate with &quot;www.example.com&quot; in the CN or SNA?  Well not much because the trailing dot forces you to the absolute hostname which happens to be what the CA issued the certificate for.<p>You can&#x27;t (assuming a search domain of &quot;example.org&quot;) ever end up at &quot;www.example.com.example.org&quot; and therefor be matching the wrong domain because of the trailing dot tells the resolver not to do that.  If a browser does do that then they have a separate bug.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134402"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=134402</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1535"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1535</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1594#section-5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1594#section-5</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name</a>\n[7] <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/security-group/certs/policy/inclusion/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/secur...</a>",1390972800

Maybe breaking with IMAP on this would make interop too hard though.<p>This requirement is convenient for the client but makes implementing robust servers harder than it need be.  If instead each message was identified by a {timestamp,UUID} tuple then multiple MX servers could do final delivery to an eventually-consistent shared store.  The requirement for strict, durable message ordering is the one thing that forces hard synchronization among multiple machines doing delivery.<p>POP3 actually made a step this direction with the common &quot;UIDL&quot; extension; IMAP4 felt like going backwards on this.<p>While I&#x27;m on the subject, another less-common POP3 extension I liked was &quot;XTND XMIT&quot;.  This gave a simple way for the POP3 client to send mail; sadly it never really caught on in favor of just using SMTP submission.  Originally though this only worked OK because SMTP was open-relay.  Once spam put an end to that it became complicated to send a message when accessing your mail remotely.  Then to solve <i>that</i> problem we had to graft an auth layer on top of the existing SMTP protocol and upgrade all of the clients and servers to support it.  If only &quot;XTND XMIT&quot; had won in the beginning everybody would be submitting outgoing mail over that already-authenticated channel and so much work could have been avoided.<p>So anyway, those are my two requests for any &quot;IMAP killer&quot;: allow the server to use unique (but non-sequential) IDs for messages and provide a way to submit outgoing messages over the same channel.",1390972668
