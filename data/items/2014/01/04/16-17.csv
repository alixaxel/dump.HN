Figure 22.1 shows that across the 27 EU countries only 25% of business owners with employees are women (for definitions, see Annex IV.A1). The low share of women has only marginally grown over the last decade in the EU27, Canada and United States&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s not kid ourselves. Women face serious hurdles in entrepreneurship. They have less access to credit when starting new businesses for one.

There is a positive correlation between gender equality and GDP per capita, everyone wins in an equitable society.",1388854790

7011660,comment,7011121,7011121,1,0,ncolor,,,"Mac&#x27;s TextEdit (a rich text editor) has been what I&#x27;ve ultimately chosen after using Evernote, OneNote, SpringPad, Simplenote, Notational Velocity, and Mac&#x27;s Notes.app. Let me explain some of its benefits.<p>- Notes are placed in Finder (the file system). This is the biggest benefit. This means that I can store notes separately in folders, according to their specific purposes. For example, I can categorize my notes by project, AND store files of any type alongside them, since they&#x27;re just placed in the Finder. I generally don&#x27;t like using specific notes apps, because what if you want to attach a real file (not a shortcut to a file) which is of a type that&#x27;s incompatible with the notes app? You can&#x27;t, because notes apps can only categorize notes. That&#x27;s very limited. With Finder, everything&#x27;s categorized according to your own purposes, and any file type can be moved into/out of each purpose. The more I use Finder, the more I love it.<p>- TextEdit is very simple, but also very powerful if you know how to use it. It generally has all the features of a typical notes app. It has rich text editing, and you can put in pictures as well. When you&#x27;re searching for a note or its content in Finder, it&#x27;ll look through all the text within the notes, not just the file names. If you want to quick look notes, just click on a note in column view.<p>- If you use a certain note more often than others, you can use Alfred (a smart search app) to launch it really quickly just by typing its name, without needing to load an entire notes app filled with notes you don&#x27;t need, and then find it yourself.<p>- Unlike Evernote, you can easily password-protect as many notes as you like by storing them in an encrypted DMG, since this feature comes with the Mac.<p>A downside for some people is that you can&#x27;t edit your notes on a phone/tablet. For me this hasn&#x27;t been a problem because I&#x27;m ten times more productive on a laptop. I can always view my files with the Dropbox app, and I can always make some quick notes on my mobile device if I ever need to. For most people, your laptop is almost always with you, and it doesn&#x27;t take long to pop it open.<p>If you&#x27;re on Windows, I think WordPad would be the right way to go. Not too sure about Linux though.<p>In conclusion, the TextEdit/Finder combo is the simplest, fastest, and most functional, notes tool that I&#x27;ve ever used.",1388853897

Google would not remove a penalty if the spammy links were still abundant. So that they are out of a manual penalty is justified.<p>Rap Genius showed good intentions to comply with the guidelines. They went out of their way to clean up their act. These were no doorway pages or elaborate linking schemes with their own servers. It was a Linking Bieber Scheme that is considered greyhat in the industry, and after this, will probably be less popular.<p>This was a large and visible PR drama. Of course both Rap Genius and Google were on top of things. Google never stated that this was to be a month-long ban. We don´t know how those thousands of other sites were penalized. Maybe the large majority is so spammy/crappy that they simply won´t rank near the top with their spammy links removed, on the merits of their content and audience alone. For sites that are entirely build on manipulating SERPs, then yeah, a Google penalty can seem permanent. To me, that is an ok thing.<p>About the connections. Sure they help. I don´t see what is wrong though with leveraging your connections when there are millions on the line. Maybe a connection humbly asked: Hey, we effed up, how can we restore trust?

Are there systems still in place from a sexist past that need to be revamped? Sure, and the flood of educated, successful women will eventually take care of that.</i><p>I can&#x27;t speak for the women groups, but I think the last sentence in the above statement has not, to their opinion, borne itself out. Thus, the need for groups that specifically advocate for them.<p>I&#x27;ll say this as a member of an &quot;empowered&quot; minority group... I&#x27;m Asian, I&#x27;ve grown up in nearly-all-white communities in the Midwest, my family was technically low-income but otherwise, I never <i>felt</i> disenfranchised. And I did follow in the &quot;model minority&quot; path of working hard and doing well for myself, and Asians, overall, perform highly on tests of academic measure and personal wealth in America.<p>But let&#x27;s ignore the thing of not all Asian immigrants being on equal footing (that is Chinese/Korean/Japanese is not the same as, say, Cambodian)...Asians, despite their empowerment, get roundly screwed in media portrayal and perception. In news coverage and in popular media. The only reason why I watch WAlking Dead from time to time is because it is so utterly astonishing to me to see a popular lead Asian character who is not at all exotic, not valued for his math skills, and doesn&#x27;t appear to know martial arts. (there&#x27;s also BD Wong in Law and Order SVU, but he&#x27;s not as much in the spotlight as Steven Yeun&#x27;s character).<p>A friend of my works in an Asian American advocacy group...we both ponder on how Asians are indeed a privileged group, yet at the same time, because collectively we do so little to be the greasy wheel, there are ways we get stepped on. But because the meritocracy seems to be working for us (as a group), there seems to be little desire to get involved in advocacy.",1388852638

The Federal Reserve is the bank that US government borrows from, and the private banks that issue the funds to the US Government make profit off of the loan.  Excess profits (outside of legally stated limits) get returned to the tax payers.  The saying goes -- there &quot;Federal Reserve&quot; is as &quot;Federal&quot; as &quot;Federal Express (FedEx)&quot;.<p>Understanding this, the banks that make up the Federal Reserve are the banks that issue credit cards and make money off of financial transfers.  The Federal Reserve is not going to do anything to endanger the profits of its member banks.  So while the Federal Reserve could create a crypto currency, assume it would be laden with an oppressive fee structure, issued and collected by its member banks.  Every bank covered by the FDIC is a member bank / Federal Reserve.<p>The only things consumers could get out of this is convenience.  Banks are hungry for profits, so there would be fees, there would be advanced currency tracking (think FBI / NSA), there would be no privacy, there would be electronic fraud that may or may not be able to be reversed.",1388852552

Hip hop tracks back in the 80s and early 90s used to contain loads of different samples all mashed together, but it slowed down a bit after people started suing. Nowadays sampling isn&#x27;t quite as popular, and sampled tracks don&#x27;t usually use more than one or two samples.<p>The rapper Fabolous had a hit song &quot;Breathe&quot; several years ago that contained a sample from a Supertramp song. The track leaked and became HUGE before they cleared the sample, so when it came time to negotiate Supertramp had all the leverage. Supposedly they got $100,000 plus almost all royalties, so Fabolous didn&#x27;t make any money off the single.  (Though of course he made tons on album sales).<p>EDIT: Just because you&#x27;re supposed to clear samples doesn&#x27;t mean people always do.

In particular, it addresses the most common comment I&#x27;ve seen in this thread, namely the rationale behind choosing to focus on general systems coding rather than kernel hacking.<p>Personally, I found the course enjoyable and worthwhile. It was not what I was expecting, and I was admittedly disappointed that we didn&#x27;t go much into actual bare-metal programming. That said, I found it to be a good introduction to the concepts of systems programming, with a few detours. As I am interested in OS coding, I&#x27;m performing my own independent study to learn the material which might have been covered in a more &quot;traditional&quot; OS course, but the course did a solid job of covering concurrency, memory allocation, etc.<p>As for the choice of Rust: I really like the language, and plan to continue using it for personal projects. I&#x27;m not sure it was quite mature enough for exclusive use this past semester (the 0.7 to 0.8 switch midway through threw the TAs for a bit of a loop), but I&#x27;ve been very impressed so far, and think that this coming semester of the course (which will also use Rust) should have a much better time of it. The one annoyance I had with Rust was the lack of documentation, but the Rust community (including a fair number of those in this thread) were incredibly helpful, and I&#x27;m currently working on a project to provide an alternate tutorial, using a series of small &quot;stepping-stone&quot; programs to build from &quot;Hello, World&quot; to a MapReduce implementation. Personally, I think I might have picked either Go or a blend of C and Rust for this past semester, but Rust is becoming a better choice as time proceeds.<p>I was also one of the members on the student team that made the ARM kernel in Rust. Due to the timing of the project (right in the middle of preparation for final exams and the rest of our end-of-semester project due dates) and some &quot;lazily evaluated&quot; work ethic on the part of our team, it was fairly rushed, and is much less complete and polished than I would like. I&#x27;m planning on continuing work on it. Though I would disagree with the assertion that separating Rust from its runtime is as &quot;painless&quot; as it has been said to be, it wasn&#x27;t terribly difficult, and solutions for that particular problem are also constantly being improved.",1388851986
