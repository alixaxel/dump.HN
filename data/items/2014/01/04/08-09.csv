I agree that the C tide may need to change, but using a language pre-stabilization AND that has literally no job opportunities is a real drag.  So, the same goes for Go as well.  And the fact that python or any other such language was even an option scared me just a little.   \nI believe in Rust, and hope it succeeds, but don&#x27;t feel this was a good avenue for it at this time.",1388825964

7010510,comment,7004644,7010424,2,0,lambda,,,"> I didn&#x27;t really see anybody getting religious, but why is it you get so emotional about this?<p>It&#x27;s just that there have been one too many threads of people promoting some particular fad diet idea (gluten is poison! sugar is poison! soylent is the food of the future!) and I&#x27;m getting kind of sick of them. I&#x27;ve been hearing these fad diet ideas for years, it&#x27;s just different things which are claimed to be the poison or different combinations of things or combination of restrictions which are claimed to be the be-all cure.<p>This thread hasn&#x27;t been particularly bad, though you were a bit overly pushy about ketogenic diets and dismissive of criticisms of them earlier: &quot;I&#x27;m not aware of any scientic data that found adverse consequences. You get a lot of resistace from health professionals because for the last decades what you eat on a ketogenic diet has been blamed for heart diseases or high cholesterol, but there never was scientific evidence to back up those claims.&quot;<p>> So eating above one&#x27;s caloric requirement and a lack of energy are always problems of willpower?<p>No, there is not always a problem of lack of willpower. Metabolism plays a role, though diet and behavior play a big role too. There are certain circumstances for which ketogenic diets are appropriate, just like there are certain circumstances for which gluten free diets are appropriate; likewise, just because they are appropriate and effective in certain cases doesn&#x27;t mean they are appropriate or effective for every case.<p>I think that for a lot of people, however, the problem is willpower. There are a lot of people who just want an easy excuse or an easy answer, when there really is an easy answer that just takes a bit more willpower.<p>I do believe that the low-carb, paleo, ketogenic, and likewise diet fads have at least helped combat the harmful emphasis on low-fat above all else. I recall at the height of the low-fat craze finding lots of fat free and low-fat foods that were stuffed with tons of sugar to compensate.<p>> I think everybody can get behind this, it&#x27;s like thinking of the children.<p>No, I don&#x27;t think everyone can get behind it. There are a lot of people who take the &quot;you can eat whatever you want as long as it&#x27;s not carbs&quot; idea and eat way too much bacon, pork rinds, and the like.<p>Fresh fruits and vegetables are healthy. Eating pork rinds instead of a banana because the banana is fairly carb rich and the pork rinds are not is not healthy.<p>> So grains healthy, fat bad? As you don&#x27;t mention meat that&#x27;s probably also bad? Well, it&#x27;s the details that get interesting, what are healthy foods.<p>I don&#x27;t think dividing it into &quot;this entire category of food is healthy, this food is not&quot; is a good way to approach your diet. So no, I&#x27;m not claiming &quot;grains healthy, fat bad&quot;. Both grains and fats are good for you, in moderation. Likewise meat. All of these things can be bad for you when taken to excess; eating too much meat can give you cancer (and some meats are fattier, leading to the problems with too much fat), too much fat can raise your cholesterol leading to heart disease, too much grains (especially highly refined grains) can lead to spikes in blood glucose and harm your insulin response.<p>What I&#x27;m saying is favor fruits and vegetables over grains, favor whole grains over refined, treat meat as a supplement, flavoring, or occasional treat rather than the central part of every meal, favor unsaturated fats (generally vegetable oils and fish) over saturated fats (generally from other animal sources), and keep refined sugar consumption very low. If you need to lose weight, eat a little less, and try to fill up a little more on things without much caloric value like greens (but don&#x27;t go spending all of your time eating salads, as they generally come with dressings that consist mostly of fat and sugar, defeating the whole point).<p>Personally, I follow this by eating meat (of any form, fish, poultry or red meat) only about 3 times a week. I never drink soda (can&#x27;t stand the stuff now that I&#x27;m not used to it any more). I generally use unsalted nuts or fruit as a snack if I need something to tide me over between meals (but don&#x27;t snack often). I usually buy whole grain bread. But I cook with butter plenty (as well as with olive oil, I love sauteing food in a combination of the two), I put cream in my coffee, I enjoy the occasional juicy steak, I eat a lot of cheese (my one main vice), and I have the occasional dessert.<p>Now, I don&#x27;t claim that my diet would work for everyone. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not out selling it; it&#x27;s just what happens to work for me. But I do think that it&#x27;s good to employ an approach of moderation and avoiding thinking about food in black and white terms, unless there&#x27;s a very good reason why a food should be completely banned (like if you have celiac disease, a nut allergy, or a moral objection to consuming animals).",1388825680

With it, we can also beat competing iOS camera apps by 400% on full-sensor shooting performance with the same iOS device and hardware.<p>Once photos are captured and buffered in real-time, our multi-threaded JPEG compression engine takes over. It compresses shots in software at speeds that exceed that of the hardware encoder normally dedicated to the task.<p>We had to reinvent JPEG to do it. First we studied the fast discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithms of the early 1990s, when JPEG was first introduced. We then extended some of that research to create a new algorithm that’s a good fit for the ARM NEON SIMD co-processor instruction set architecture. The final implementation comprises nearly 10,000 lines of hand-tuned assembly code, and over 20,000 lines of low-level C code. (In comparison, the SnappyCam app comprises almost 50,000 lines of Objective C code.)<p>At first we did try to leverage the iPhone graphics processing unit (GPU) for the DCT computation. It turned out to be a dead-end. Back then, iOS 4 limited the data transfer speed in and out of the GPU; but even with that limitation eliminated, with the introduction of OpenGL pixel buffers in iOS 5, it appeared that the GPU parallelism was limited to about two render units that ran at a slower clock-rate than the main CPU. Without support for OpenCL or multiple render targets, we were also forced to use a naive (slow) DCT algorithm that was essentially a full matrix multiplication.<p>The ARM NEON approach was optimal: the SIMD pipeline can perform up to 8 simultaneous arithmetic operations in parallel at the full clock rate of the device, without any data transfer overheads, and allowing us to use any DCT algorithm we could conceive. And when it comes to speed, it’s all about doing less for more. Less computation, more work done, faster.<p>We also optimized out pipeline bubbles using a cycle counter tool so that every clock tick was put to work.<p>JPEG compression comprises two parts: the DCT (above), and a lossless Huffman compression stage that forms a compact JPEG file. Having developed a blazing fast DCT implementation, Huffman then became a bottleneck. We innovated on that portion with tight hand-tuned assembly code that leverages special features of the ARM processor instruction set to make it as fast as possible.<p>Similar innovations were put into a custom JPEG decoder, powering the unique SnappyCam thumb-to-interact living photo viewer. When dealing with massive 8 Mpx (32 MByte BGRX uncompressed) images, decoder performance became critical to a great user experience.&quot;</i>",1388824307

I have developed some concerns with it over the years.<p>1. Fear of data loss... it&#x27;s probably the largest part of my mistrust of all these dang cloud services that want to control/own me or otherwise lock me into their service. I run a 99.999% uptime, extreme scale, SaaS business across multiple active/active data centers, I know exactly what it takes. It’s incredibly hard to do, and I don&#x27;t trust anyone at a rapid growth company to do it right. In the ever constant scheduling battle between features and doing it right, features frequently end up winning, especially in consumer focused SaaS business with meaningless SLA’s. My Evernote library is clearly much much more important to me than it will ever be to Evernote. No amount of marketing spin will ever lead me to believe otherwise. This really is my own hangup though. At some point I may just get over this. To their credit, I have only ever lost a few notes in the 4-5 years I have been using the service.<p>2. Tight lock-in (the cynic in me always says it’s clearly engineered this way) to the platform, frustrating process to export my notes to another tool. This is a problem across the industry. Everyone playing the lock-in/stickiness game. Portability is key. A simple text export of my notes would go a long way to make me happy. I really don’t want html exports of my text notes.<p>3. Security of their cloud service...frankly, I don&#x27;t trust anyone and wish I could store my evernote data on my own; self managed; self encrypted; shared storage platform. 2 factor was a nice step in the right direction. Self managed encryption keys is when I will stop whining about it… I understand this makes a lot of things hard, and am willing to forgo some features to get this feature.<p>4. Lack of reasonable support for Linux. Evernote is now the single sole tool keeping me from dumping my Mac and moving to linux... Yup, note-taking is that important to me. I have tried nevernote, everpad and the like, but they are still pretty weak. I understand this isn’t Evernote’s problem and Linux is a very small market, but its a big deal to me.<p>5. A frankly lousy text editor. Seriously, I keep expecting this to get better, and it just never quite gets there. And don&#x27;t get me started on tabs and indenting. I often edit notes in mac textedit and then copy them into evernote. Not because TextEdit is great, but because its predictable and just works. I&#x27;m not looking for advanced features here.<p>6. Strange as this may sound (I may be using the tool wrong), I really hate marking things off my list like at the grocery store. It takes so dang long to mark off a list while pushing a shopping cart and fumbling with a phone. I now print my list out and cross things off with a pen because its so way less frustrating... This may be an edge side use case, but still... the phone apps (both droid and iPhone) are not wonderful.<p>I fully subscribe to the belief that I am a weirdo, and these are really just my perceptions and random thoughts. I have remained an active, albeit reluctant user, and at this point plan to stay that way for at least a little bit longer. I always used to joke that if evernote, things, and dropbox ever merged, I would happily pay double. These days though, I am looking to support my own stand alone instances of these types of tools without being tied to 3rd party cloudy services so tightly.",1388823862

The question of the war(s) was discussed in very simple terms. Basically, both candidates agreed: &quot;we have to catch the bad guys&quot;. They disagreed over minor things but that was the idea. Basically, the voters were addressed as they were 5-years old kids, and pretty much didn&#x27;t have any choice.<p>This issue is extremely important, both ethically, economically, strategically and so on. Still, no meaningful information was given, or alternative choice or anything.<p>So you can tell me that the reason why both candidates agreed on this issue is that americans are pro-war, and that&#x27;s rightly reflected with the two candidates left at that stage of the election. But I don&#x27;t think americans are pro-war, and even if they are, I don&#x27;t think there would be if they were correctly informed.<p>In any case, this decision is not a collective decision made by well-informed people. It&#x27;s made at a higher level by people with their own agendas. What else is it if not a failure of democracy?<p>This is true for war, but it&#x27;s pretty much the same thing with mass surveillance, wealth redistribution.<p>On the other hand, a friend in Oregon showed me his voting form, and their were several referendum about a variety of things. Then, there were references to what looked like objective websites that weigh the pros and cons about the question to vote for (for instance, a treaty with the indians). I find it ironic that so much detailed information and decision power was given to the voters concerning a treaty with the indian, when wars in iraq and afghanistan are summarized by &quot;trust us, we have to catch the bad guys&quot;.<p>&quot;2. If enough people were to work together to make that change a reality, is there anything that could realistically stop that change from happening?&quot;<p>No, probably not. But it doesn&#x27;t mean that our democracies are working. The fact is that for some reasons it doesn&#x27;t happen and we&#x27;re left with decisions made that don&#x27;t represent the public interest (or, at the very least, decisions that weren&#x27;t collectively made).",1388823043

In a browser, the exact height of text will vary on each browser/OS and the proper way to write the HTML/CSS is to use static positioning and floats to position items to handle this. In this manner, if there is an image below some text, if the text wraps shorter or longer, the elements below will shrink up or expand down to preserve the design.<p>It also automatically supports Google fonts. You can use any Google font and it will automatically link them into the file.<p>It also has CSS3, IE8 and IE9 compatibility levels for your taste. The CSS3 version creates a smaller web page because it can use rounded rectangles and gradients.<p>Also, some designers will always prefer to code by hand but some parts are rote (e.g. specifying width/height, font size, font family, etc). We can shave off most of the conversion time by generating all the assets and a reference sheet with all the CSS styling, the x/y positions so that you can have full control over your code but still save lots of time.<p>We can also generate a layout sheet that contains all the elements and styling except for the positioning so you can choose to float, absolute, relative position, etc.<p>We also export in HAML, Slim, Jade for HTML formats and LESS, SASS, SCSS and Stylus for CSS formats.<p>But at its simplest, open your image, and click one button and it will generate a web version of any Photoshop image.<p>www.webbsy.com",1388822750
