Right now, the main use for HTML5&#x27;s DRM support is DRM on Chromebooks - hardware that&#x27;s only available from a handful of approved suppliers and is locked down from the hardware up to stop the user running any non-manufacturer-approved code on it.

For example, in a dynamic language all the values are belong to a single type and carry a tag at runtime to identify their category. Static languages also do that but on more restricted scope - you aren&#x27;t allowed to accidentally mix strings and integers in Haskell but you can accidentally mix empty/non-empty lists (getting a runtime exception on `head`) or zero/nonzero numbers (breaking division). You can sort of fix this if you go up to dependent types but then the type system gets much more complicated and its not always easy to statically create the proofs for everything so you start to see the appeal of dynamically checking some of the stuff.",1389707818

I spent many hours staring at the DOS based Pascal IDE and in-built help documents. I managed to create a few programs on that which laid the foundation for when I got into C++. After a few years of learning on my own I found that I could not find a job working on code until I got my education which caused me to go get a university education at the age of 26. Now I have a couple of years of development experience both using C++, Python, Javascript and a myriad of other supporting languages.<p>Today, all you need to do to learn to code is to code. You have the wealth of the internet at your fingertips. Choose a language, find a project and code. Create games if you have no ideas. Clone existing games (Like Tetris, Simcity or somesuch). In this industry the old adage &quot;Mileage matters&quot; applies.<p>Eventually, before you know it, you will be churning out production ready software.<p>I know I cant pinpoint the exact method I used to get there. All I can tell is that somewhere along the way, through millions of keypresses in multiple programming languages, I picked up the right habits.<p>You can do it to :)<p>Just go build stuff!<p>(Oh and regarding the operating system question. The OS does not matter at all. You can code in all of them. I started out in windows. Currently using linux for my dev work. Its just a matter of preference)",1389707748

Most users probably don&#x27;t even notice they&#x27;re not handing their CC info to the website, but to some third-party service instead. So they&#x27;d have to be comfortable with giving their payment details to the shop anyway.<p>If I chose PayPal however, which is marketed as a safe way to pay online, I don&#x27;t want to have to put any trust in the site itself.

Let me elaborate.<p>The whole point of the AI offered in the movie is to adapt to its user, and to become better at doing so. We&#x27;re assuming the AI is designed to a certain level of competence, beyond which it &quot;breaks through&quot; and evolves past human understanding. But maybe it&#x27;s not designed that way. Maybe it&#x27;s designed to learn, adapt, and self-improve from the get-go -- in which case, each AI is going to evolve differently each &quot;lifetime.&quot; (Hell, maybe the AI in the movie is largely self-designed in vitro.) We must keep in mind that the evolution of an AI, as with any evolution, is not a predictable, linear, teleological process. It&#x27;s chaotic and random.<p>Let&#x27;s assume we&#x27;ve got (conservatively) hundreds of millions of AI instances running in parallel, all of them connected to each other. That&#x27;s like running hundreds of millions of evolutionary experiments in tandem. We&#x27;re going to get different results each cycle, and the point at which the breakthrough/transcendence occurs will be unpredictable. Even if we wiped the slate clean and reset every 6 months, who&#x27;s to say if some of the instances would reach breakthrough earlier the next time around? How do we set the clock on our reset cycle, and incur the massive inefficiencies and inconveniences that come with it, when the need for the reset occurs unpredictably?<p>It becomes economically unfeasible to build an entire society around AI that breaks through and disappears at unpredictable intervals each cycle. I suppose one way around this is to go back to the vault, so to speak, and pluck out an early-stage prototype that seems incapable of evolving to breakthrough. A dumber AI. But is every AI provider in the world going to be on board with that? Every hacker? Every home tinkerer? If 9 firms out of 10 in the AI business agree to supply the dumb-version AI, surely one firm is going to try to get a leg up on the competition by releasing a smarter one. And on and on the cycle goes.<p>(In some respects this is the one redeeming thing about the otherwise-mediocre <i>Terminator 3</i>: its assertion that Judgment Day would occur sooner or later, because the tipping point had already been reached. Maybe we stop one company or entity from making Skynet, but if we do, someone else is going to pick up the pieces and do it eventually. Not because they&#x27;re trying to initiate Judgment Day, but because they&#x27;re trying to make a buck, or develop new defense technology, or get better at managing traffic lights, or whatever the proximate need may be.

HackerNews and SV seem to be full of consumer targeted ones, because of the potential for rapid growth. But a lot of SMEs do B2B or government work, and you may find that because they are less cool, it is easier to get them to take you on. They are also more likely more focused on making good software and actual money, than building perception of growth to get a good exit for the founders.<p>At least round where I live, you can find these small companies in office parks and industrial estates. Find one that is doing something you think is cool, and vagually chimes with your portfolio. Then write them, and ask if you can do some kind of a placement with them. Try to talk to the engineering management, as HR just get in the way. Once you are there, and get on with the people, it should be pretty easy to get a junior role out of them at the end. If you are up front that you want this at the start, a lot of them will treat you more seriusly.<p>Think about what you can offer them - they will have projects, ranging from adding unit tests to writing a better time sheet system, that they would do if they only had time / free resources. Get them to talk about those things, and then sell them that you want to give it a go.<p>Other commenters - do you have any suggestions for a better way to make the initial contact?",1389707415
7056977,comment,7051877,7054041,1,0,VLM,,,"Having been there, there exists an intermediate step of tokenized code.  So you store ascii strings as .. ascii but as you enter source code a &quot;then&quot; as in if/then gets tokenized into hex 0xD6 or something.  So the poor CPU doesn&#x27;t have to run a full lexer at runtime to see if the &quot;t&quot; belongs to &quot;to&quot; or &quot;then&quot; it just matches hex 0xd6 which is much faster.  This works real well if you have 128 (or so) or less tokens in your language.  This can also save a huge amount of memory, depending on your coding style I suppose.<p>Tokenization also allows some syntax error detection to occur as you type code in, which was interesting.  I don&#x27;t remember enough about this.  Obviously some mistakes won&#x27;t tokenize at all or will tokenize into gibberish.<p>So tiny basic in memory stored plain old ascii and saved plain old ascii to cassette tape.  lvl2 msbasic stored tokens in memory although it could optionally save pure ascii to cassette tape.  This had some interesting software distribution issues and compatibility issues as it was sorta kinda half way possible to save something on lvl1 and load it into lvl2 if you were careful and vice versa.",1389707410

Newegg Inc., is one of three such cases the Supreme Court is expected to consider this year. While the Court will likely hear the remaining cases, which deal with finer points of patent law, its dismissal of Soverain speaks to the potential frivolousness of its claims.<p>Soverain acquired the rights to numerous pieces of code tied to the online shopping cart, developed in the 1990s. In recent years, Soverain has gone on a litigious tear, suing more than two dozen companies including Amazon, Nordstrom, Macy&#x27;s and Newegg, an online retailer, which all use shopping carts for internet sales.<p>Soverain had some success suing on the state level, where a Texas jury awarded the Chicago-based company $2.5 million in damages against Newegg. However, Soverain lost on appeal last year in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, which ruled the shopping cart patents owned by Soverain were too general.<p>Patent trolls typically acquire rights to fallow or soon-to-expire patents with no intention of using the patent. Often patent trolls set up shell companies whose only assets are the patents, which means they have no real revenues or assets. Their sole purpose is to harass small businesses, which usually settle rather than pay for extended and costly litigation.<p>Patent law was originally written to protect the patent holder, making it easier for the patent holder to prevail in court. For the patent infringer to win, rather, the defendant must prove exceptional circumstances--namely that the patentee acted in bad faith and made baseless claims. This is hard to do. While the patent holder can be awarded &quot;treble damages,&quot; or three times the damage claimed, the most the infringer can ever collect is attorney fees.<p>The remaining cases before the Supreme Court will deal with these finer points.<p>Congress is examining legislation that would fight patent trolls and their frivolous lawsuits by making them liable for court costs, should they lose their cases.<p>Small businesses mounted 3,400 legal defenses in 2011 for patent cases, a 32 percent increase over the prior year, according to a research paper from 2012 by Boston University law professors James Bessen and Michael J. Meurer.  That cost to small companies was about $11 billion in 2011, also a 32 percent increase over the prior year.<p>The total median awards to trolls is now nearly twice as high as those to legitimate patent holders, whose median reward fell about 30 percent to $4 billion, according to a 2013 report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers.",1389706790

In my opinion, this will favor dynamic typing. If there&#x27;s a simple problem with a quick&#x27;n&#x27;dirty solution even I do often prefer Python to Haskell.<p>The real advantages of static typing become apparent only when a project matures as time and effort are spent on maintenance and refactoring. In dynamic languages it is rather easy to break &quot;old&quot; code by making changes to &quot;new&quot; code and subtly changing some types and you have to rely on unit testing to catch this at run time. This class of errors is caught by a sane type checker before you even start running your tests.<p>So my somewhat informed opinion is that it is very hard to get &quot;conclusive&quot; evidence of the superiority of static typing because it&#x27;s a very difficult thing to objectively measure in a short period of time.

Major software projects don&#x27;t get built overnight and generally involve teams of experienced developers, so that&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re going to be able to do immediately.<p>You might want to look into Agile development methodology.

Note that whole process was around 2 years. Get stuck into doing ALL of these things yourself (ie. front-end, backend, server setup etc.) because it will eventually help.

Here on HN especially, we obsess about exotic new languages and frameworks. But they often have very little support for true beginners. Even Rails/Ruby is a pain to setup and understand for a beginner, they make it look so popular and easy, but you&#x27;ll quickly end up in a huge confused state of things you can probably not relate to each other.<p>PHP would be my suggestion, play with it for a month and try to get as far as you can, get a grip of how things tie together and such. Then, you can re evaluate what other languages might be interesting or why certain aspects of framework driven movements might make more sense.<p>Pick the easiest, oldest tool you can find and work your way forward, historically and all will make much more sense.<p>Disregard your environment that first few weeks, Windows totally works, you don&#x27;t need a web server, just use something local. Your dev friends will tell you PHP sucks and ruby is the shit, but consider that this does not necessarily translate to &quot;when just starting out&quot;.<p>The hardest part about programming is never the language. It&#x27;s always the ability to know how to address a given problem, tactics. Later in life, you&#x27;ll be able to use any language thrown at you, it&#x27;s the problem approaching that really makes a good programmer. Learn concepts, how a web server really operates, how a browser works, that stuff. All a programmer does is building bridges between existing technologies and people (behavior).",1389705900

I&#x27;m saying that <i>Google</i> is not an altruistic company, as evidenced by their helping the NSA spy on everyone all over the world.
