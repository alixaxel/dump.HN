Yes, offering a smaller selection can increase conversion but that has nothing to do with how the curation process works on the backend to present the selection. Whether you do it by your method or by going full on AI, you can still present a limited selection.

The only thing that actually looks new is &quot;sharing audit log&quot; and an audit log is a long way off from being able to effectively control sharing. Changing someone&#x27;s password to log into their dropbox, delegate ownership of the folder to a shared account helpdesk controls, and then have helpdesk go through every shared folder to remove a terminated employee, then sending the original user a password reset, then requiring a helpdesk touch for every sharing change in the future isn&#x27;t a valid business workflow. Furthermore, in the past Dropbox&#x27;s audit logs have been paginated lists you click through online. Not the sort of thing you can automate. Here&#x27;s hoping for a change.<p>Also, notice the phrasing: &quot;With separate Dropboxes for personal and work, administrators can have the control necessary to secure company data, and you can still have your most important stuff at your fingertips.&quot; That sounds suspiciously like a sentence that says nothing at all, considering it&#x27;s already easy to run two dropboxes, and all the problems I listed concern fully administered business accounts.<p>Remote wipe will be nice though.",1390009961

I&#x27;m talking about the 2nd case, of locking down dependencies used to build an application whose &quot;users&quot; are not even aware of the presence of dependent libraries nor the structure nor configuration of the underlying software. In this second case, isn&#x27;t [freezing/shrinkwrapping/committing/bundling] the dependencies generally considered the right thing to do?<p>Of course, updating the dependencies (whether for patches or more consequential updates) in subsequent releases is fine... but within a given release cycle, one otherwise runs the risk of unexpected inconsistency, between e.g. a developer build and a CI build done a short time later.<p>I think this discussion illustrates the problem and might be more articulate than I&#x27;m being: <a href=""https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/538"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/538</a><p>Thanks @hdevalence -- and anyone else who cares to comment. :)",1390009937

It would register as an impression to the ad company, so the content publisher would get paid, and at the same time the user would not have to look at the ad.<p>If you raise the issue of the ad company paying for people who don&#x27;t watch the ad, just consider the situation of the ad industry in any other media. TV ads? The viewer can easily turn off the TV during the ads, like I do, or change the channel to a channel not showing an ad. The same is true for radio ads. For ads at the start of a movie, you can come to the movie 10-15 minutes late, thus getting there right when the movie starts and skipping the ads, or just wait in the lobby until the ads are over. Magazine ads you can easily skip to the articles and never look at the ads.<p>Even in web ads, you can take my old father&#x27;s &quot;low-tech&quot; add blocker, a paper cutout he hangs on his monitor that physically block ads in the margin on the side of the screen.",1390009757

The idea is simple: we want to store data in a compressed form, but also perform certain operations quickly without uncompressing.<p>These can be very useful for certain applications. The article on &quot;Cramming 80,000 Words into a JavaScript File&quot;[2] is a nice example. It shows you how you can store a compressed trie in memory but still use it. I also like this[3] series of blog posts leading up to wavelet trees.<p>These certainly count as obscure data structures, unlike many of the ones listed on SO. I had never even considered the <i>idea</i> of compressing data in memory like this, much less encountered actual examples of succinct data structures! I have to thank Edward Kmett for introducing me to the whole field.<p>These data structures are important not just because they&#x27;re neat themselves, but because they got me to think a new way. In particular, I realized that using pointers all over the place--to represent things like trees--is not always efficient. Instead of parsing data, it might be better to store it as a blob of some sort with a binary index.

Why can&#x27;t we write<p><pre><code>  S = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ...\n</code></pre>\nas<p><pre><code>  S = (1 - 1) + (1 - 1) + ...\n</code></pre>\nIf we permit ourselves to do that, well, suddenly the sum &quot;appears&quot; to be 0 and not 1/2.  BTW, if you want a somewhat-more rigorous reason for why the sum &quot;should be&quot; 1/2...<p><pre><code>      S = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ...\n\n  So then\n      \n  1 - S = 1 - (1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ...)\n        = 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 + ...\n        = S\n\n  which implies S = 1/2\n</code></pre>\nWe&#x27;re not proving that S = 1/2 here, though.  We&#x27;re proving this statement: if it makes sense to talk about S and we&#x27;re permitted to do the things we just did to S then S = 1/2.<p>Terry knows all this, of course, which is why he says, &quot;If one <i>formally</i> applies (1) at these values of {s}...&quot;  That word &quot;formally&quot; is key here.  To a mathematician &quot;formally&quot; means &quot;in a purely symbolic manner without considering whether there&#x27;s a sensible or consistent way of interpreting these symbols.&quot;<p>So, Terry is saying, &quot;If we treat these sums as purely symbolic entities then when we substitute in s = -1 we get a the purely symbolic statement 1 + 2 + 3 + ... = -1/12.&quot;  He then goes on to illustrate ways we might make sense of this purely symbolic (formal) sum.<p>The video, however, is no &quot;proof&quot; of anything at all.  It&#x27;s just a shell game with symbols on a page, relying on people&#x27;s vague intuition about what we&#x27;re allowed to do with numbers.  Just because the symbols in the video include those we typically take to represent numbers and addition doesn&#x27;t mean they actually do.",1390007673

Is there a bigger arrow anywhere today pointing to a fundamental problem in government? This is way beyond &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot;&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;ve got a failure to communicate.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s go through what I said item by item:<p>WHAT I SAID EARLIER:<p>&quot;Nor should the tools that collected the data continue to exist. They should be disconnected and destroyed. All data, archives and logs, upstream and down, should be destroyed. All copies should be destroyed...Any and all specifications of how the system is built should be gathered and destroyed..&quot;<p>ELABORATION:<p>Because if they aren&#x27;t, then at any moment in the future the machines can be turned on again instantly and the process restarted, or the data retrieved. Where is our security in that?<p>In fact, because of what has happened, we must also either establish a method of oversight for the NSA or abolish it entirely. Reason for this is that the NSA has spun out of control (at least) once already and there is nothing to prevent it from happening again. Congressional oversight did not control the NSA nor did the Executive branch control the NSA; some other oversight is required at the very least. At worst the entire agency should be liquidated.<p>WHAT I SAID EARLIER:<p>&quot;Those persons who managed, conceived, designed and built the systems and wrote the software should be terminated w/o pension and tried for crimes against the state. I&#x27;m talking top to bottom of NSA.&quot;<p>ELABORATION:<p>They have violated the most fundamental, the most basic of our human rights. To prevent this happening again they must be prosecuted and punished.<p>WHAT I SAID EARLIER:<p>&quot;They should be, regardless of conviction, forever banned from re-implementing any similar systems forever. They should also be marked someway in the public record as having participated in the creation of these systems so that we can track them all their lives and ensure that they do not repeat what they have done. A federal agency should be created to track them and check periodically that they are not violating these terms. In other words, they should serve a permanent &quot;parole&quot;, with their civil rights reduced (as they have reduced those of millions of Americans), the remainder of their lives. They have forfeited their civil rights by participating in the NSA&#x27;s offenses and should pay dearly for it.&quot;<p>ELABORATION:<p>Again, once they are officially convicted and therefore felons they should be treated as such. Even if they aren&#x27;t convicted, their future activities will have to be tracked until they die and their work product reviewed. Furthermore, because of the flagrancy of the violation and the dangers posed thereof, conviction or not, they should be prevented forever from participating in such activity again.<p>I know we&#x27;re trying to put the genii back into the bottle here. But because we can&#x27;t put the genii back into the bottle doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t for all practical purposes do damage control on his work. We can at least rip him and the bottle to shreds, burn every piece and scatter each shred under a different rock in some other part of the world. And by putting a federal agency on prosecutory watch for the next 20 years, we can suppress some of the damage already done by the NSA and some of the damage that their information-gathering would otherwise have done.<p>Satire, my ass.<p>The domestic portion of the NSA needs to be dismantled completely and utterly and the FISA court system discarded. The older open established legal framework for getting warrants must be restored for use by _all_ governmental agencies.",1390006846
