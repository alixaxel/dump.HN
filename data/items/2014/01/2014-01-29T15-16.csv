If companies went around offering contracts for double-current-salary, full benefits, and guaranteed employment for 5 years, positions would be filled fairly quickly.<p>If the required price point is higher than a company can afford, maybe key goals, plans, and roles need to be reevaluated. As I say to my coworkers all the time, software project estimates are not very accurate, so if business will die without 10% returns on their software development investments (or being within 10% of schedule estimates), everyone&#x27;s already in trouble.<p>> The three that come to mind right away are Ruby, Python, and JavaScript<p>That&#x27;s highly dependent on the problem domain.

Technical familiarity with crampons, ice-axe, etc&#x27; is a must, and a high level of fitness is required.<p>I agree that it&#x27;s a bit of an exaggeration and most expedition organizers are responsible and take preparations seriously and require their participants to be in good health and fine physical fitness.<p>And then there are the organizers that aren&#x27;t. In the Discovery documentary, there was one particular group of Chinese climbers who were practically pulled up the hill with ropes by their sherpas.<p>Even the group who were followed in that documentary, from an organizer with a good reputation, led by a well known mountaineer had some members whose physical condition was a bit questionable. There was a motorcycle accident victim who could barely keep up with the climbers at the lower camps and in the end refused to turn back when told so by the expedition leader, putting himself and his sherpas at peril. But most of that group were fine climbers with proper preparations.<p>I do understand that judgment doesn&#x27;t quite work well at 8000+ meters, even with supplemental oxygen.

Incompatible goals decrease with distance; I can honestly say that I don&#x27;t care at all how various African warlords divvy things up among themselves.

You can assert that your opinion is the only valid one as long as you want, but if we&#x27;re going to have a discussion about it I&#x27;ll have to disagree on that point.<p>Communitarianism may be how they perceive themselves, but if you look at the prevailing structures that image falls apart pretty quickly. In fact, American-branded Christianity displays many of the characteristics of Authoritarianism, since it&#x27;s also a quasi-political system rooted in many aspects of public and private life. Let me recycle your condescending Wikipedia-pasting maneuver here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism</a>.<p>It&#x27;s a strict hierarchy that comes straight down from a deity, branching off to layers of people with power derived and intertwined with that religion. Obedience is seen as a mandatory trait, and those Communitarian properties are only exhibited as long as members don&#x27;t violate one of the many arbitrary tenets and restrictions on behavior. One of the many restrictions is by necessity the censure of science and knowledge.<p>At the same time, I&#x27;d be ridiculous to call the US an outright Theocracy, even though it has some similar traits. But the strict and militaristic hierarchy complete with large-scale control of public opinion makes it a better match for a system that has strong authoritarian traits.<p>Such is the limitation of labels. It&#x27;s often hard to find one most people can agree with. They&#x27;re of limited use in these cases, other than to approximate a certain meaning. However, that approximation is very brittle when communicating with people who are pissed off and/or disagree strongly about everything to begin with.<p><i>> In Islamic countries, the prevailing mood is far more authoritarian.</i><p>That&#x27;s something we can agree on, as I believe I&#x27;ve said earlier in those comments you like to mock.",1391009099

The statement that &quot;Sequence X_i has never been tossed&quot; is independently probable for any long sequence X_i. The author is only making a single statement, and while it&#x27;s true she has no particular reason to focus on the particular sequence of constant heads her statement is completely logical and very far from being refuted by observing any particular sequence of 76 coin flips <i>unless</i> it just so happens to be 76 heads.<p>The illogical point only arises if we try to take many of these independent statements all at once. If we take some significant chunk of sequences and state they&#x27;ve each all together never been seen before then we eventually must stop feeling that statement is probable.<p>One way to clarify the whole thing is to assign a bet to any given probabilistic statement. The author bets $10k that nobody has ever seen 76 heads. I can bet $10k that nobody has ever seen 76 tails. In each case our expected value on these bets is identical. Someone else could bet 10c on each possible permutation and be guaranteed to win, but obviously forced to distribute his bet.<p>It&#x27;s not at all illogical for me to feel very confident that your coin flipping sequence wasn&#x27;t all tails. It&#x27;s highly illogical for me to believe your coin sequence wasn&#x27;t in the set &quot;all possible coin flipping sequences of length 76&quot;.",1391009023

IE7 compatibility mode works plausibly well for visual display but as eonwe&#x27;s link pointed out there are still some key differences.<p>That link, however, doesn&#x27;t really mention the worst part: IE8-as-IE7 does not have a compatible DOM or JavaScript engine. They&#x27;re using the IE8 JS engine under the hood which is generally better but, among other things, it started raising exceptions for previously ignored bad code. I found out about this shortly after IE8 was released when my then-employer&#x27;s Oracle apps stopped working because they used a really old version of a UI toolkit which at one point set zIndex to null before assigning it a new value. This is clearly invalid according to the specs but prior to IE8 it appears that nothing threw an exception. I ended up patching the JS file because getting a patch would have taken aeons and Oracle support actually called me asking if they could redistribute my work to other customers!<p>The good news is that Microsoft finally came up with the right way way to do this in MED-V, which will seem very familiar to anyone who&#x27;s used e.g. VMware Fusion: you run antique versions of IE seamlessly inside a VM and the host&#x27;s Internet Explorer can be configured to load certain sites inside the guest so you only take the performance / feature / security hit for your legacy enterprise apps instead of the entire web:<p><a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/video/Ff945178"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/video/Ff945178</a>",1391008955

7144242,comment,7142381,7144108,5,0,rayiner,,,"> I meant the concept of the word liberty, it was (which I thought was obvious) not intended to be a description of the cultural differences as a whole.<p>I wasn&#x27;t talking about cultural differences, I was talking about liberty. This is the basis of my point about conflating communitarianism for authoritarianism. Most religious Americans, particularly Christian Americans, display many characteristics of communitarianism: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communitarianism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communitarianism</a>. To them, liberty is not impinged by the establishment of religiously-based social standards and expectations. It&#x27;s not totally consistent with classic liberal ideas about individual freedom, but is in fact quite consistent with a game-theoretic understanding of how totally free choice at an individual level isn&#x27;t necessarily what maximizes free choice at a societal level. Rational secular humanists often believe in economic regulation, but ignore the fact that the same forces that lead to problems in unregulated economies can apply to unregulated societies.[1]<p>In Islamic countries, the prevailing mood is far more authoritarian. The practical importance of religious leaders and their edicts is far stronger. There is a chasm of difference between laws in a democratic society having a religious influence because the polity happens to be religious, and laws having a religious basis because of state establishment of religion.<p>> Sigh, this is the second time someone accuses me of angling for cheap upvotes.<p>For me, and I would imagine &#x27;bananacurve as well, the purpose of mentioning upvotes was not to accuse you of angling for cheap upvotes, but to deride the upvoters.<p>[1] Right now, I live in Wilmington, Delware. There is an urban decay here. In 2011, we had 23 murders, for a city of about 70,000 people. Berlin that same year had less than 20, but is a city of 3.1 million people. The social structure has collapsed. Most of the kids are raised without involvement from fathers, gangs have replaced the authority structure that would&#x27;ve come from parents, etc. And &quot;education&quot; isn&#x27;t going to fix it. Wilmington spends about $14,750 per year per pupil, as much as Switzerland, which is the OECD country that spends the most. Germany spends less than $10,000 per year per pupil. I&#x27;m not saying religion is the solution either, but you can&#x27;t blame people for thinking it could be. Unrestricted individual liberty, where people have sex whenever they want and men abandon women and children as soon as they become inconvenient, clearly isn&#x27;t leading to the greatest possible prosperity for the community. I&#x27;m not sure why European countries don&#x27;t suffer from these ailments to the same degree, but I have a feeling that socialism has something to do with it, serving as a replacement for the communitarianism that is breaking down in many places in the U.S.",1391008400

If the distributors is under contract that forbids granting such permission, the result is again quite expectable. The only option would be to add restriction on distribution on top of the BSD license, making it proprietary licensed. I will grant jwr that GPL is different from BSD in that aspect, since it do not allow proprietary licensing.<p>Neither has anything to do with patent agreements, because it all focus on permission for redistribution, use and modification. Patent agreements are one company contractually promising not to sue the other company or their customers over patents, and thus we have GPLv3.
