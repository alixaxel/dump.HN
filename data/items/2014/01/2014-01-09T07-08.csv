7029337,comment,7028443,7028443,16,0,jandrewrogers,,,"The article does a somewhat poor job of explaining the success of the AK47 in the context of the time it proliferated. Because the discussion of such things tends to be dominated by fanbois of one military rifle or another, the good and bad of the weapons tends to be overstated.<p>One of the biggest advantages of the AK47 is that it could be manufactured en masse with relatively simple manufacturing equipment that was widely available and inexpensive in the middle of the 20th century. Consequently, it could be produced even in marginally developed countries as a matter of both technical ability and economics. Contrary to popular rumor, a number of countries produced AK47s with relatively tight tolerances so lack of precision machining was not intrinsic to its success.<p>By contrast, and many people forget this, when the AR15 family of rifles was first produced, only a handful of industrialized countries had the ability to fabricate the precision aluminum parts used in the rifle en masse. When the design was exported, the US often exported precision aluminum foundry and machining technology at the same time. That limited adoption as a practical matter.<p>All that said, the reputation of both the AK47 and AR15 suffer from relatively isolated instances of defective implementation. A well-made AK47 has perfectly serviceable accuracy, comparable to many European assault rifles. However, its operational ergonomics are atrocious. By the same token, the AR15 functions far better in filthy environments than popular mythology suggests; most infamous incidents of documented systemic failure were ultimately traced back to out-of-spec components. An AR15 will not take quite as much abuse as an AK47, but it makes up for it by being one of the most highly optimized assault rifles in the hands of a skilled operator due to the unusual operating design.<p>In short, both the AK47 and AR15 offered compelling economics because they were designed for and used by disjoint markets with very different priorities.",1389254279

7029316,story,7028415,,1,0,legutierr,,,"The point I was making is that the idea of deflation being bad is more than just a &quot;tired argument&quot; as you put it, but is based on a lot of people doing meaningful research.  You can dismiss the study of Economics as internally inconsistent all you want, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that a strong argument has been made, based on empirical data and historical analysis, that deflation is a significant contributor to economic depression.  Economics will never be as precise as the hard sciences, but that doesn&#x27;t make economic research and theory totally invalid, especially in areas where different schools are largely in agreement.<p>As a layman, when I read the Wikipedia articles you site, as well as the article on the Great Depression [0], it seems possible to get a sense of the different sides of this controversy.<p>With regards to the Great Depression, it appears that there is a general consensus that a precipitous decrease in money was a proximate cause of the worst crisis.  Austrians may argue that there was too much money in the economy before the 1929 crash; Monetarists may argue that there was too little money in the economy <i>after</i> the subsequent banking crisis; Keynesians may argue that there was too little <i>spending</i> after the crisis (with their solution being debt-driven government spending, i.e. inflation).  All three of these viewpoints, however, seem to be different perspectives on the same phenomenon.<p>In other words, unless you dismiss the entire study of Economics outright, and therefore accept none of its findings, it is worthwhile to be concerned about deflation, and its exacerbating effect on the business cycle.<p>I also think it unwise to equate a fear of deflation as being the same as a love of inflation.  Some people may argue that moderate or even high inflation are good in some cases, but, for what it&#x27;s worth, I do not hold that viewpoint.  I am personally of the opinion that a monetary policy is best which has as its objective consistently low inflation, with the primary intent simply to keep inflation above zero to avoid dipping into deflation.<p>In other words, inflation is bad, but deflation is much worse; zero price fluctuation may be ideal, but it is impossible to achieve, so to be safe it is best to target some positive inflation value close to zero but high enough to account for the margin of error that comes with implementing any monetary policy.  The links you provided seem to describe situations where monetary policy deviated from this objective, and where a restriction of the money supply may have been the correct solution.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Great_Depressio"" rel=""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Great_Depression</a>",1389253736

Heck, I even do it myself (badly and in German though, so no links). I still can&#x27;t stand baller &quot;culture&quot;, and before you think that&#x27;s just a while middle-class dude not checking his privilege, read this:<p>> What really hurts me sometimes is that there’s not a lot of consciousness in their music. There could be a whole lot more. Rapping is communicating-it should be an instrument for our liberation. We don’t have time to talk about being players and hustlers and gangsters. We didn’t come off of the slave ships that way. We need to become proud Africans again and stop running around in Shirley Temple curls talkin’ ‘bout how we’re pimps and players. A lot of the symbols that are in rap records and videos are indications of decadent consumerism and in a very real sense, those gold chains, hundred-dollar sneakers and T-shirts with a designer’s name on it underline how much they’ve become enslaved by the consumer mentality in the United States-consumer slaves.<p>-- Assata Shakur<p>It&#x27;s not respectful to support self-harm because &quot;that&#x27;s just how the culture is&quot;, it&#x27;s simply not knowing any decent rap and having no comparison. Rap is infected with bullshit, IMHO exactly because it could and should be such a powerful thing. Conscious rap is potentially dangerous; talking about bling and bitches is not.<p>As for rapgenius, compare the obsession with it on HN with the &quot;who? stop spamming us with ads&quot; reactions on slashdot: <a href=""http://slashdot.org/index2.pl?fhfilter=rapgenius"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slashdot.org/index2.pl?fhfilter=rapgenius</a> - Hilarious.",1389250866
