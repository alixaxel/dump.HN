The worldwide trend for more than a century is that the countries that are now developed countries have been gaining about 2.5 years of life expectancy each decade (sometimes expressed as &quot;six hours each day&quot;).[0]<p>Girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100, with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot;[1] by James Vaupel, originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. An article in a series on Slate, &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet? Life expectancy doubled in past 150 years. Here’s why,&quot;[2] gives background on the incremental changes that have increased life expectancy. (&quot;Period life expectancy&quot; is what is usually reported for a whole country. But cohort life expectancy provides a better estimate of future lifespans of young people today,[3] and is still steadily on the rise around the world.) Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world.[4] It&#x27;s great to hear that India is enjoying this kind of development too.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1963392_1963367,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-why-we-die-global-life-expectancy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=longevity-w...</a>",1390970932

7141915,comment,7134798,7136199,1,0,Double_Cast,,,"> <i>It is trivial for an literate individual with the proper context to understand concepts in language that seemingly transcend the words themselves. These notions and are exceedingly difficult to formalize, and any formal expression of these ideas would cause exponential growth of the output.</i><p>My interpretation: &quot;I find formal logic&#x27;s ineptitude at resolving ambiguity disappointing. But humans resolve ambiguity without breaking a sweat. Is it possible to generalize logic to encompass ambiguity?&quot; I think the answer you seek lies in Probability Theory.<p>> <i>a word to the wise is sufficient.</i> [1]<p>How does a brain quickly derive intended meaning from an ambiguous lexicon like the English Language? Realize that an infinitude of nuanced interpretations are equally possible, but not equally probable. Suppose Alice says to Bob &quot;The sea/c&quot;. If the topic was Marine Biology, Bob will expect (assigns a high probability to the hypothesis) that Alice meant <i>the ocean</i>. If the topic was Typography, then Bob will expect that Alice meant <i>the glyph</i>. Similarly, computers which deal with ambiguity (e.g. speech interpreters, facial recognition) assign higher probabilities to some interpretations than others.<p>> <i>If efficiency, lack of ambiguity, etc., were the paramount goals of human language, surely formal logic, or perhaps even a programming language for interpersonal communication would be more fitting than natural language!</i><p>Computers can communicate practically instantly, but humans are bottle-necked by how quickly we can move our lips. Therefore, I would expect spoken languages to be optimized toward articulating a little as possible. One technique is overloaded vocabulary. I think humanity prizes the ability to compress information down to a single word. This unfortunately comes at the cost of computer-level clarity. But I mean, &quot;one-liners&quot; do make for great movies, don&#x27;t they.<p>> <i>Ever try explaining a joke to someone who didn&#x27;t &quot;get it&quot;? It takes a lot more &quot;space&quot; to convey the same sentiment than to someone who &quot;got it&quot;.</i><p>As far as I know, humor is one of those things that scientists don&#x27;t fully understand yet. But some have a rough idea. I&#x27;m convinced music and humor are related in the sense that they set up an ambiguous &quot;expectation/motif/theme/ context&quot;, and then playing on that expectation.<p>Music is defined by tension and resolution: tension being ambiguity and resolution being validation. Google an analysis of Beethoven&#x27;s 5th, and it will say that the opening intervals create tension because the key is uncertain to the listener. Google Music Theory, and you&#x27;ll learn that the Chromatic Scale is built around the tension between the dominant and the tonic. Occasionally, rather than deliver the punchline, a composer will leave his or her listeners hanging on a suspended-chord or a leading-tone. To experience this cliffhanger, listen to a track with a bass drop, but turn it off right before the actual drop.<p>Similarly, humor resolves around setting up an ambiguous expectation, and resolving it. The proposed neural mechanisms vary. But jokes always seem to involve a set up, and punchline which is unexpected, yet satisfying. And I think this is because the context is resolved. pg shared a related idea in one of his essays about ideas: &quot;That&#x27;s what a metaphor is: a function applied to an argument of the wrong type.&quot; [2]<p>With the above in mind, I believe it&#x27;s possible for today&#x27;s computers to predict whether a human will find something funny or not. But unless they&#x27;ll be taught which types of topics humans considered relevant (i.e. deixis), computers would find themselves at a significant disadvantage.<p>> <i>We have to let go of the machine if we ever want to really move the state of the art forward.</i><p>Probability theory is already used in AI. That&#x27;s really cool, but I don&#x27;t think the art as a whole needs to move forward. Though both turing complete, speech and programming languages are optimized very differently. I&#x27;ve already pointed out the different constraints. But also notice that while programming primarily aims towards conveying <i>instructions</i>, human speech encompasses a wider spectrum of goals. Meticulous clarity will have a higher impact on instructions like &quot;automate this task&quot; than declarations like &quot;broccoli tastes weird&quot;.<p>> <i>There are an infinitude of expressible ideas, but lacking the proper medium to abstract the expression of these ideas formally (like natural language and our brains do, well, naturally) we will never get a chance to find out what we don&#x27;t know!</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure exactly what this is getting at.

Why is this thing a focus of anyone ? Why is it allowed to teach people to kill other in response to what any American would consider freedom of speech ? To teach people to follow slavery laws and so on. I mean, given that that is not just being done, but growing.

I won&#x27;t be able to answer them all, since this would expand the discussion enormously, but I&#x27;ll get through some of the points.<p><i>> I believe it&#x27;s easier for the regulators in a free market system to get in bed with the regulated because those most motivated in regulating a specific industry are those within the industry itself. </i><p>You do know that ex-regulators and those closest to the political elite are usually hired by companies to serve as lobbyists (usually called something like &quot;consultants&quot; or &quot;advisors&quot;)?<p><i>> You may believe it&#x27;s obvious that consumers will switch to the better option in the market but the vast majority don&#x27;t because the majority of people can&#x27;t pay attention to everything they spend money on all the time.</i><p>Absence of a government doesn&#x27;t mean people would need to waste more time tracking things. It means they would have a choice of who would track all these things for them. So, for instance, I subscribe to consumer protection agency A and it then simply drives my choices based on its research. People wouldn&#x27;t need to choose everything by themselves.<p>Also, you can&#x27;t excuse forcing people to do certain choices because they, allegedly, are not willing to make them on their own. It smells nanny state and unless you give people choice of experiencing why is it important to make choices and giving them time to make them, they will never learn. When slavery was abolished, many slave owners used to say that black people cannot survive on their own, they don&#x27;t know how to work for money and how to spend it properly, so they would be much better off with their master. Indeed, in some cases that was true, because it&#x27;s very difficult to learn to do things you never tried doing before. Eventually, they did learn.<p><i>> Instead consider what happens if for the sake of argument I forget my payment one month or I&#x27;m outside of my protection services city/village. Am I suddenly no longer protected and subject to others whims? Are there roaming fees for protection? </i><p>The way the market would work nobody can predict. What I can say is that it would find a way to provide you with what you need. One can imagine that when you go to a different territory you are protected by another company with which your company has a contract. If your company doesn&#x27;t have a contract with another company or you are a poor person who can&#x27;t afford protection, my guess is that you would still be able to count on some minimal level of protection: if people in my neighborhood are getting robbed, I as a paying customer of my protection agency would want them to prevent this happening regardless of whether the victim is their client or not, because next time it could be me.<p>Again, I think you have interesting questions, but I believe this discussion can go endlessly. At this point, I&#x27;d like to recommend you one book, it is called &quot;The Machinery Of Freedom&quot;, written by David D. Friedman, who is an economist and a lawyer. In it, he thoroughly describes how a society without government would work. One of the most interesting chapters is about competing protection agencies and why they in fact wouldn&#x27;t turn into de-facto government-like mafia. He also has some very interesting talks on YouTube which I recommend. I think this book would definitely be of interest to you. You may not be convinced by it, but it presents some great mental exercises and it would at least provoke you to look at the world from a different point of view. If it happens so that it does change your mind, please email me, I&#x27;d be very pleased to know that happened :)",1390969912

You&#x27;ve been warned.)<p>To me the most important item is his difficulty with processing the feeling of consent in his abuse experience.  This is incredibly hard to face, and an inability to do so puts you at permanent emotional risk.<p>And this is a commonly experienced issue.  After all pedophiles convince themselves that this is a love affair.  And children have a strong desire to please adults and authority figures, so provide plenty of evidence for this.  Furthermore it is very confusing for a child to reconcile, &quot;This feels good&quot; with &quot;I don&#x27;t want this&quot;.  Doubly so when an authority figure is telling you, &quot;I can see how much you want this, doesn&#x27;t it feel good?&quot;<p>Yes, logically there was no consent.  But the experience of abuse leaves you feeling that there was.  And emotions respond to experience, not reason.  Furthermore unprocessed emotions have a nasty way of blindsiding you with no warning.<p>Now why do I know this?  It is because I was homosexually abused for 5 years.  I know what it is like to go through, and how to deal with the aftermath.  And I&#x27;ve talked to plenty of others who have had to deal with it as well.  It is easy to fool yourself into believing that you have dealt with it..only to find that there was another dimension that needs dealing with.  That sounds like what happened to Jesse.<p>Now nobody knows what causes sexuality to be wired the way it is.  But it is possible that if Jesse had fully dealt with issues around his own feeling of consent (even though there was none), then he might not have been a pedophile.

In other words, Bill Gates is not using his wealth very efficiently; it would be more efficiently used if it were spread around. It&#x27;s not his fault, exactly: no single person can be expected to make efficient use of $30 billion, or whatever his current net worth is. But the fact remains that it seems likely that there is some maximum level of wealth that a single person can make reasonably efficient use of, simply because a single person doesn&#x27;t scale. If that&#x27;s true, then that&#x27;s an argument <i>for</i> altering the rules of private property if a single person accumulates wealth above that level.<p>As for incentives, I find it very difficult to believe that if, for example, we set a threshold net worth of $100 million and said that anything above that gets taxed away (of course it would be more complicated than that in practice, but let&#x27;s keep it simple for this discussion), Bill Gates wouldn&#x27;t have started Microsoft because, oh, well, he&#x27;s only going to get $100 million from it.",1390968077
