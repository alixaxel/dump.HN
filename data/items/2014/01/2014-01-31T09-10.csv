For #2, while state is useful at times and a necessary evil in many other cases, it&#x27;s hardly ideal.<p>Even a single parameter seems decidedly un-ideal. To do useful work in general, you&#x27;re typically going to want to take two parameters: something to be modified, and the modification to make. This can be done with state (modify in place) or functionally (return a new object with the modifications applied). Once again, having a single argument seems to imply either something not very useful (basically a getter or some similar derive-a-value function) or something relying on mutable state. You need two arguments to achieve the sort of combinatorial power that makes functions interesting and properly useful.",1391159909

It’s typical human nature which calls for that added zeal of personalization in every product that they wish to buy. From furnitures to attires to even phone covers, we always tend to choose the ones that are unique and only possessed by us. Many of my friends including me often go grumpy when we see someone carrying the same wallet or worse, wearing the same t-shirt like that of ours at times. It’s kind of a mutual feeling from both ends, we just want to carry off our own style. But alas, are often disappointed because of the lack in personalized goods available out there. Now, at such junctures of time when products like Pyramid Wallet comes into the limelight, it’s then that the magic of having personally designed belongings gets unveiled.",1391159628

The problem comes when you start to need that library.

Yes, you have to set up nginx once, but as mgkimsal mentioned setting up your project for using AWS is not done without any work either.
