You are optimizing the transaction (hiring / taking a new job) rather than the process (a long, mutually beneficial relationship).<p>First, As an individual evaluating opportunities, how much more likely are you to learn if there is a not a good fit and therefore avoid months in a sub optimal job?<p>Second, the concept of a company still being at 99% or 100% productivity doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me. If you leave a job, the company is at 0% productivity for that specific job you were filling.<p>Third, based on the comments, this will push certain people away from Automattic (e.g. &quot;I don&#x27;t do anything for free&quot;) and into the hands of the competitors. Automattic gets a double win: lower probability of hiring people who aren&#x27;t willing to put in effort to find a good long term fit and they raise the probability that their competitor does. Awesome for Automattic and for the entire team, who gets to work with higher caliber people.<p>Finally, from a behavioral psych perspective this has some similarities the Zappos &quot;pay you to leave us&quot; approach.

Better to go straight to the source.<p>In particular:<p>⚫ SlickRSS is an in-browser RSS/Atom reader for Chrome.  If you prefer <i>not</i> having your list in the Cloud, it&#x27;s a good way to manage and access feeds:  <a href""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slick-rss/ealjoljnibpdkocmldliaoojpgdkcdo"" rel""nofollo"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/slick-rss/ealjoljn...</a><p>⚫ newsbeuter is a console-mode interactive RSS/Atom reader.  This is actually my preferred tool for general use as its keyboard navigation makes cutting through feeds lightning fast:  <a href""http://newsbeuter.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://newsbeuter.org/</a><p>⚫ rsstail and multitail are two utilities by Folkert van Heusden which allow you to tail one or more RSS/Atom feeds (or other processes and/or files in the case of multitail) from the commandline.  It&#x27;s effectively a stream in your shell.<p>So with multitail and rsstail, you can easily create an impromptu and transitory feed monitor of something of interest -- say, the StackExchange question you just asked, even if you&#x27;re not logged in to SE to monitor it (you can similarly monitor reddit users, subreddits, or posts, and numerous other sites, though major &quot;social&quot; sites seem to be sadly lacking in RSS export support).<p>A further extension is to use multitail to watch <i>all</i> of your newsbeuter (or other) feeds.  I detail more on this here:<p><a href""http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1udv6i/further_adventures_in_rss_chrome_reader_extension"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/1udv6i/further_...</a>",1389163024

RCN works in neighboring Somerville and FIOS is all over greater Boston. Cambridge is a bit less dense than Somerville but generally more affluent, so there&#x27;s no good reason that RCN wouldn&#x27;t expand into it. It simply doesn&#x27;t make sense to say that all these companies aren&#x27;t interested; otherwise why would they have approached the council in the first place? What would it even mean for them to have sought a license and then decide it&#x27;s &quot;not currently part of their business plan&quot;? There&#x27;s nothing particularly special about Cambridge, but for a city its size and with its access to the backbone, there&#x27;s a very odd lack of choice.<p>I think a key to the issue is:<p>> City officials stand ready to negotiate with any willing operator<p>What are we negotiating over, and what does the CCC require these operators to do to get a license? What does &quot;willing&quot; actually mean? It&#x27;s not clear, because if they want to set up a network and Cambridge wants them to set up a network, there&#x27;s nothing to negotiate over. Yes, there are some costs involved in digging up the street, but if they work in other cities, they should work in Cambridge. AFAIK, the details of the Comcast plan are shamefully non-public (at least, I&#x27;ve never seen them), but I think the obvious conclusion is that the council is making unreasonable demands on the ISPs, counter to their citizen&#x27;s best interests.<p>This they&#x27;re-just-not-interested line the CCC is selling simply makes no sense.

(I don&#x27;t claim to know any good ones, perhaps that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so interesting and why we discuss hiring so much).<p>You&#x27;re still beginning by submitting a resume - they are replacing <i>parts of interviews</i> with auditions, though they suggest there are interviews too, so it&#x27;s more of a supplement than a replacement.<p>So Automattic is adding something to the process, something non-trivial in time commitment. I think I can show that this hurts them.<p>~~~<p>Employers need to keep in mind that there are some vast asymmetries between employer and the (prospective or not) employee. For instance, some common cases:<p>* When an employee is fired, they are at 0% productivity until they find a new job. The employer on the other hand is at 99% or 100%[1] productivity. This is in short why we have things like unions, because negotiating power in terms of productivity lost to both parties (employer and employee) approaches equal when the employer has all employees at stake, not just one.<p>* When an employer wants to fill a position, they have one spot and can try out several candidates (even with auditions) simultaneously. When an employee wants to find a job, they need to spend time choosing to fly out to places to interview. These decisions are hard, because there&#x27;s opportunity cost involved: When you fly to place A to interview, you&#x27;re spending that time not looking for other, potentially better jobs and/or flying to place B.<p>This ups the ante of the opportunity cost significantly. It&#x27;s becomes an awkward gambit: &quot;I&#x27;ll pay you $25 an hour to pause your search for a job (you&#x27;ll do our tasks instead), and after an indeterminate amount of time, perhaps offer you one.&quot; That would get some strange looks on a job board. It becomes an odd form of speculative work.<p>You&#x27;re trading a lot more of your time (that you could be spending evaluating other jobs) to hone in on this one, and then they may not accept you. It seems to be a good deal <i>if and only if</i> you&#x27;re <i>certain</i> this is the job you&#x27;d prefer over the others you&#x27;d seen so far, or that you have hopes of seeing.<p>Otherwise, this is the one prospective job you&#x27;d want to entertain last.<p>So this might look good to Automattic since they are capable of handling the load, but they are forgetting that such a load is not preferable from the employee&#x27;s perspective if you have many decent job offers. A shorter, more streamlined hiring process will probably win out, since they&#x27;re likely to try interviewing <i>anywhere else</i> first (easier) and since the opportunity cost anywhere else is less. I&#x27;d like to think we&#x27;re at least a little rational about this, at least those that feel somewhat time-constrained when job searching, like the currently unemployed.<p>I <i>think</i> this gives other companies a slight edge against Automattic, at least for prospective employees who have options. I think by doing this they will lose good candidates, even ones who might (eventually) entertain their lengthy interview process.<p>Am I off base here? Or does this seem sound?",1389160989

I was wondering.. if price wasn&#x27;t a part of the equation (I know it is, but humor me), would you still have migrated?<p>I look at the offerings in general and despite the fact that I&#x27;ve used neither, but am going to, it does look like Linode offers slightly &#x27;more&#x27;, albeit for a substantially higher cost?",1389160948

There is something special about dialing a number and getting a real person who knows how to configure DNS and troubleshoot your international propagation and provide real assistance and empathize without sounding like they are feeding you canned BS.<p>I&#x27;ve never rebooted my Linode, except for their free upgrades.  Recently I&#x27;ve purchased their backup service, which saved my ass when I decided to upgrade my Arch Linux install and butchered a package conflict which resulted in effectively destroying my box.  I was able to quickly spin up a new install of Arch, mount my previous server, and copy over configurations.  The LISH console has also saved my ass as well... too many times; I&#x27;m not a server admin!<p>I feel very much in control of the remote box and that is primarily why I will always recommend.  However, they had one hiccup during my time with them, where they leaked sensitive information and withheld accountability for a while.  It was frustrating, because I gave them benefit of the doubt, but secretly agreed that it was sketchy.  If anyone reads this who works there, staying quiet matters negatively towards your credibility.",1389160923

If you spin up five basic Linodes and delete them all after a day, you get nearly $100 back in Linode credit but you still get charged for $100.  With DO, you get charged for only what you use.  If you spin up a droplet and then delete it after a day, you only get charged for like $0.17.  To my broke college student self, anyway, that&#x27;s a preferable business model.",1389160914

I&#x27;m not an expert, and would be interested in hearing from one, but I imagine that wireless networks could benefit from algorithmic advances in a way that might be more difficult in traditional copper/fiber networks.<p>If you gave me (someone with very little wireless experience but used to be a cable guy) carte blanche, here&#x27;s what I would investigate:<p>Several routers in an urban area which require minimal installation and can be mass-produced and immediately interchanged - think roof access, and could be turned on and off remotely, maybe battery operated, flowing to relatively few fiber hubs.<p>Infrastructure advantages: Network algorithms have come a long way, and the ability to dynamically add or scale nodes as needed could have great performance/cost balances that aren&#x27;t possible with fixed nodes.  And upgrades do not require new lines, just more and better routers. If a router dies, replace, and send the old one to a shop somewhere inexpensive. No midnight service restoration pay.<p>Customer advantages: I connect to wifi the same way I do right now. Zero home installation (google Comcast horror stories if you need imagery).<p>If I were to start, I would do it in an urban area with a landowner that had a monopoly. Hyde Park, Chicago is like that. There are basically two landowners: University of Chicago and Mac Apartments. You have to make one community love you to pieces before branching out, and that would require a lot of cooperation. Of course a danger here is if Mac suddenly decides that they hate you and removes access privileges. But if that worked, and you got more funding to expand, imagine the word of mouth: &quot;Here&#x27;s how installation works: it&#x27;s a wifi network and you connect to it&quot;.<p>A la &quot;it&#x27;s a folder, and it syncs&quot; dropbox. Presumably something like this has been tried before, but that&#x27;s true of many things that end up working (like search engines or social networks).",1389160849
