If you were in a female-dominated profession like nursing or elementary school teaching then yes, I think things like that would wear on you pretty quickly after a while. Every time, it would be a tiny little reminder that no matter how hard you try or how successful you are, you&#x27;ll still be a bit of an outsider.[0]<p>Some people would probably be more consciously aware than others of the fact that the 3 letters &quot;bro&quot; are a reference to &quot;bro culture&quot;. Here are a few groups of people whom I think would be most likely to notice: People new to tech; women who&#x27;ve had bad experience with &quot;brogrammer&quot; types; &quot;brogrammer&quot; types themselves. It seems like a bad idea to adopt any policy likely to make the first two of those groups uncomfortable while signaling approval toward the third.<p>[0] Side notes: 1. Those professions are making a real effort to change these patterns to be more inclusive, too. And 2. Gender inequality in tech is nevertheless a more pressing problem than gender inequality in nursing, because tech is considered a higher status career.",1390690793

Today and yesterday have been the only days where I have ever commented on something related to gender politics.<p>To simplify matters, this argument is all about whether &quot;bro&quot; is a sexist term. There are arguments for and against this statement. To me, it isn&#x27;t so much that Geek Feminism Wiki is <i>feminist</i>, so much that I think it is <i>particularly biased when it comes to this particular issue</i>. These are two different issues, unless you believe that every feminist thinks that &quot;bro&quot; is sexist, which I do not believe to be true.<p>But what I think about the whole &quot;bro&quot; being sexist thing is irrelevant to the point I am trying to make. People on both sides feel strongly about this issue. And opinion of the Geek Feminism Wiki is very divided depending on which camp you&#x27;re in. So when you are the side arguing FOR &quot;bro&quot; to be sexist, I think it is particularly unlikely that you will be able to convince someone on the other side by using Geek Feminism as a source.",1390690730

7122906,comment,7121692,7121692,203,0,mikehar,,,"As a co-founder of Picnik, I was surprised by this article. It contained several errors which is pretty astonishing given its brevity. Here are a few corrections:<p>1) Sposato was not a founder of Picnik. He was hired by the two founders, myself and Darrin Massena.\n2) Sposato did not decide to sell Picnik. Naturally he was very involved in the process, but the decision was ultimately made by the board (which Sposato was not on). I can tell you that it was not an easy choice. \n3) Picnik was not a &quot;photo-sharing&quot; site, it was a photo editing site with very limited photo sharing.\n4) &quot;One-third of our 25-person team, including my two business partners, quit right off the bat”. Both co-founders worked at Google for slightly more than a year. Sposato was there for about two years. Most of the people who left were marketing support or office management. We did lose our lead designer to Apple, but I don&#x27;t recall any other product related departures in the first year.<p>Picnik was amazing. Great team, we had a lot of fun and millions of amazing customers. It was very rewarding to work on a product that your customers love. Selling was a tough choice. Picnik was very healthy, profitable and growing. We felt like we were able to capture much of that value in the sale price and also have the opportunity to work on a product at Google that we felt would have a huge impact.<p>Unfortunately for us, within our first six months Google decided to focus on Google+ and there wasn&#x27;t room for any other photo product outside of Google+. I completely understood at the time why Google+ was important to Google, it just wasn&#x27;t important to me. So I left. I don&#x27;t know how we could have been able to predict the shift in focus to Google+ even with perfect visibility into Google. From what I gather, such a large shift in focus and investment was a unprecedented in Google before Google+.<p>I think Google is a great company, I have a super high opinion of the people that I met there. Perhaps this wasn&#x27;t the optimal exit for the Picnik team, but it was pretty damn good.<p>-mike harrington",1390690613

After Encarta was retired, that group took it on themselves to create a lean competitor to Blackboard. The effort lasted about 2.5 years. It suffered from a lot of internal political resistance, because at the executive level, competing with Blackboard was viewed as being neither a smart battle, nor &#x27;synergizing&#x27; enough with the Windows/Office prime directive. However, what eventually killed the project was the recognition/fear of how much bureaucratic resistance there would be from schools themselves, and perhaps to a lesser degree the tangle of privacy laws.

7122856,comment,7122416,7122672,8,0,27182818284,,,"I used to work at a large university. (Actually a couple universities.) That was <i>sorta</i> the case. IT people hated with a passion Blackboard and Talisma. Administrators hated it sometimes, but that isn&#x27;t their job, because they aren&#x27;t developers / IT people. Professors often jail break out of it if they can by running their own webpages with HTML table layouts because even that is preferable.<p>The bottom line I saw is that nobody <i>once</i> admitted to liking either of those systems, but the total amount of work and politics involved to change from those systems meant it was a conversation that never really even occurred.<p>Some observations I had with respect to migrating away from hulks like Blackboard and Talisma:<p>1. There were pretty talented people supporting Blackboard and Talisma working for the universities full-time with salary. Both systems were frustrating for them, but the huge amount of work to migrate away from those systems generally stops any hopes of beginning a conversation. Can it be done over summer break? If not, will you do it in parallel? Won&#x27;t that require more salaries to be hired? can you get the buy in of the other departments who you&#x27;ll put extra work on because their system already has been coded to chug along and work with those?<p>2. Politics. I once saw a different university choose an awful CRM because they did a better job courting the top IT advisors at the school. I&#x27;ve seen a university choose Microsoft over Google even though students voted overwhelmingly for Google (emails announcing the Microsoft win were sent out before the students could even have voted)<p>3. Politics, but this time personal ones. There are people whose role has been to support Blackboard or Talisma <i>for a decade</i>. Their kids are now in high school and all that time the household was supported because their role was Director of Something but really it meant, &quot;make sure your team keeps Blackboard or Talisma going&quot;. They&#x27;ll obviously be hesitant to switch.<p>(In case you haven&#x27;t heard of it this is another hulk in higher ed that people don&#x27;t like, but it persists: <a href=""http://www.talisma.com/en-us/solutions/highereducation/pages/higher_education.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.talisma.com/en-us/solutions/highereducation/pages...</a>)",1390689888

An online testing engine supporting both automated grading and human grading with a wide variety of question types and an easy to use test builder.<p>2. A gradebook tool that&#x27;s easy to set up, can import and export spreadsheets, and can support any wild scoring system a faculty member can devise (and they can come up with some doozies). It also needs to integrate with any and every other tool in the system, as some faculty somewhere will want to grade every single type of activity students can perform in the system.<p>In addition to those two baseline elements it needs a world-class collaboration system for file-sharing, plus messaging and forum tools and online chat. It needs to support multiple class sections with unified resources, ad-hoc class groups, and student-initiated study groups. It needs to support fine-grained permission schemes based on classes, instructors, grad assistants, sections, individual students, and groups.<p>Every file, test, assignment, forum, and chat room all need to be able to be gated access based on student activity so that, for example, a quiz must be passed before getting access to a document which leads into an assignment followed by a forum-based discussion.<p>Research is also critical to support, and your system will need to be accessible in a secure way to collaborators, guest instructors, and remotely-enrolled students around the globe, in a way that doesn&#x27;t make the faculty wait more than a few minutes to grant those people access.<p>All of this will need to be provided in a fully responsive user interface that scales well from 4k screens down to tablets and smartphones, including the testing and gradebook engines. You&#x27;ll also need a free mobile app that provides all the same funcionality in a reliable native interface on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry OS, and more.<p>You also need to integrate with the University&#x27;s student information system, and update enrollments in courses and sections on the fly as students add/drop and courses change, and send grades to the SIS in return. You need to integrate with external tools at the university such as wikis, message boards, and eTextbooks; and outside including cloud-based calendars and document sharing tools including Google Apps for Education and Office365.<p>You&#x27;ll also want a instructor evaluation system, electronic portfolio functionality, program-level assurance of learning awareness, institutional assessment reporting, user activity monitoring.<p>Oh and all of this needs to be customizable to match the traditional way of doing business at each of thousands of different universities. Business processes are not up for compromise.<p>Notice I&#x27;ve left out concerns of usability, security, performance, stability, ease of deployment and upgrading, etc. That&#x27;s because those are at the bottom of the list of priorities for the people with the money.<p>So... good luck.",1390689739

They acquired much of the competition along the way (WebCT and Angel).<p>Desire2Learn was boot-strapped, slower to grow but had traction with state-wide systems. Blackboard sued them over patents, went into a whole legal mess and ended with a cross-liscence agreement for the &#x27;greater good&#x27; of education. After litigation, Desire2Learn grew substantially and took on 80M of venture funding in 2013, and is on-track for IPO.<p>Instructure (Product called Canvas) is the newcomer and &#x27;next-generation&#x27; platform. It&#x27;s designed well and marketed far better than the incumbents. It&#x27;s growing much faster (for good reason) then the others, and on-track for IPO as well. They&#x27;ve done a good job of UX and getting involved at the professor/teacher level to create a following for the platform.<p>Open source:\nSakai is a collaboration of several Higher-Ed institutions to develop their own platform. It was never great and last I heard support is dropping.<p>Moodle by market-share is the largest. There are several companies which offer hosting/support for Moodle (A large one in NA being Moodlerooms, which Blackboard also acquired).",1390689086

7122739,comment,7122163,7122163,12,0,reuven,,,"I&#x27;ve been teaching programming to many people, for many years.  The majority of my students are experienced programmers, but no small number are new to programming beyond very simple stuff.   I&#x27;ve found that Python has a number of aspects that are ideal for first-time programmers:<p>- It&#x27;s dynamically typed.  Say what you want about static vs. dynamic typing, but this is one less thing that newbie programmers have to get right.  There&#x27;s no chance of an error when they say &quot;i = &#x27;abc&#x27;&quot;, if you&#x27;ve defined i to be an int.<p>- It&#x27;s interactive.  The fact that you can &quot;play&quot; with the language within the interactive shell is a huge selling point.  IPython and the IPython Notebook are easy to get working, and for people to work with.<p>- Python&#x27;s restricted command set and simple, regular syntax let you concentrate on ideas: Yes, many newbies to Python (and to programming in general) get confused by indentation, blocks, colons, and the like.  But they&#x27;re going to get confused by the syntax of nearly any language.  Python has a simpler syntax than most other languages, meaning that there&#x27;s less to learn, and less to remember.  This lets the new programmer concentrate on the ideas that they&#x27;re learning, or the implementation of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>- It&#x27;s cross platform.  The fact that people can use Python on any computer they like is a big selling point.<p>- You can easily teach object-oriented and functional-style programming.  Python is obviously object-oriented, but can also be used to introduce functional programming.  In this way, you can expose programmers not only to multiple paradigms in Python, but also in other languages.<p>- You can use it for real applications.  People are often surprised to discover that real-life applications are being written and used in this language that they&#x27;re learning, which seems so simple.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there are more reasons than these.  But let&#x27;s consider the alternatives that the article suggested:<p>- I would be hard-pressed to think of a <i>worse</i> first language than C.  You want to introduce people to the concepts of programming, which means abstractions and high-level thinking.  C forces you to think in terms of the computer and its memory, which is just the opposite.  The fact that it&#x27;s compiled to binary form, that you don&#x27;t have an interactive C shell, and pointers are just three reasons why I think that C would be a very bad choice.  Sure, everyone should learn C at some point -- although I often point out that I&#x27;m a much happier person since I moved to dynamic, high-level languages many years ago -- but if you want to teach the concepts of programming, C is going to require too much learning just to get simple things done.<p>- JavaScript has many good points for beginning programmers -- but the chief problem, in my mind, is the language&#x27;s syntax, which is far too inconsistent and forgiving/flexible for newbies.  I think that someone coming to JavaScript from Python will have a very easy time; the mapping of data types is fairly straightforward, and even the notion of passing functions is pretty easy to get.  But the learning curve in JavaScript seems steeper to me than in Python, despite the obvious advantages of being able to work within a browser.",1390687843
