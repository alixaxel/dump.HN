7054640,comment,7052835,7054235,3,0,barrkel,,,"Object lifetime is a much more important factor than class size for most server request / response style processing.<p>Typically there are three lifetimes for objects in server processes. Those that are allocated around startup and are never deallocated; those that are allocated per-request and become garbage once the response goes out; and lifetimes that span multiple requests, like objects in caches.<p>The first are normally ultra-cheap to &quot;collect&quot;: with a generational GC, you simply don&#x27;t scan them at all, because they haven&#x27;t changed.<p>The second group, per-request, are also fairly cheap to collect. Every so often, you GC the youngest generation, and you only need to keep track of references in registers and on the stack. Ideally many requests will have occurred between collections, and the only objects that get kept alive are objects that are in-flight for the current request. And this is why you need at least three generations; you really don&#x27;t want to have to scan the oldest generation to collect these ephemeral objects after they&#x27;ve built up over a number of youngest generation collections.<p>It&#x27;s the third group that kills you. You can save on the cost of scanning the whole heap, using write barriers to track new roots buried in the oldest generation; but that adds accounting costs, and eventually overtakes the cost of a whole heap GC. These guys can also cause the fragmentation you&#x27;re worried about - they need to be compacted down, copied possibly multiple times. On the CLR, last time I checked, you need a full gen2 GC in order to get rid of them, as they&#x27;ve likely survived a gen1 collection.<p>With these guys, it&#x27;s worthwhile doing the big object thing. In fact, it may be worthwhile not having any GC heap storage for them at all, and refer to them using different techniques, like ephemeral keys that look up in Redis, or native pointers stored in statically allocated arrays.<p>In app servers I&#x27;ve designed, I&#x27;ve never seen GC CPU usage over 5% or so, even with heavy usage of tiny short-lived objects.

The more the healthcare market is socialized, the more prices will be distorted. The goods you listed may still have rational prices, still being provided by the market, but the prices of services will be distorted since there&#x27;s no actual trade involved (hence no price signals) so it has to be centrally planned.<p>And yes of course health provision is complex, which is exactly why the prices cannot be rationally decided by central planners.

Eventually tools were created that allowed people to simulate key presses in such a way that previously impossible feats became a reality.  For example, many game quirks rely on pixel perfect or frame perfect executions of button presses.  Also, some sequences of button presses are simply too quick or elaborate for the human hand to reproduce.  Thus, the TAS scene emerged and took speedrunning to a whole new level.  It&#x27;s unfair to compare a human speedrun with a TAS speedrun, so it is necessary to specify the &quot;TAS&quot; acronym whenever a run is shown having been created with the use of tools.

Years ago I painstakingly clicked through for hours and copy-pasted the conversation to a text document.<p>2. I had a close friend die very suddenly and at a young age. My memory generally kind of stinks and I hated that there were conversations with him that I half-remembered. I went back through social media conversations with him (again, mostly on myspace) a lot in the years that followed. It helped me piece together memories that are very important to me now.<p>3. This past year my wife and I adopted our daughter. Our relationship with her birthmother has primarily been via SMS and the months that followed were a really exhausting and beautiful blur. It&#x27;s really important to us that we&#x27;re able to share that thread with our daughter someday.<p>In none of these cases did I see it coming that these services would end up having such valuable content in them for me.

7054539,comment,7052927,7054280,12,0,jfarmer,,,"Yes and no.<p>It depends on the business and product.<p>First, Everpix had revenue, yes, but they had negative marginal profit (<a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_profi"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_profit</a>).  Since their business is based around charging customers $X/month, their unit economics are incredibly important.  If I buy candy bars for $3 and sell them for $2 I can also show &quot;real revenue,&quot; but nevertheless this is still a terrible business.<p>Second, what&#x27;s a better business, Google + Adwords or Google + charging $5/month/user.  The latter puts a tight upper limit on the total size of your market.  Google is unquestionably more profitable with the former business model rather than the latter, but it took Google years of not being profitable before they made it happen.  If you look up articles about Google in the late 90s they were filled with hand-wringing about how they&#x27;ll make money.  The same goes for Facebook, which I think most HN users still dismiss as a fad.  Nevertheless, they&#x27;re very profitable and have been for many years.<p>VCs care mostly about the size limiting case and how likely we are to reach that limiting case.  You can say this is stupid, counterproductive, etc., but for whatever reason that&#x27;s the course Everpix decided to pursue.  The logic of VC investing makes sense and it was Everpix&#x27;s decision to take that route vs. remaining small-but-profitable, assuming the latter was actually an option.<p>Third, we can also contrast SnapChat and Everpix&#x27;s situation from a game-theoretic perspective.  Let&#x27;s say SnapChat was charging, I dunno, $5 to download the app.  Conservatively, let&#x27;s assume that had no effect other than X% fewer people downloading the app.  So, fewer people download the app, but we now have a very, very nice gross margin.  In fact, let&#x27;s say there were 5 similarly-sized SnapChat clones, each charging the same amount.<p>What would you do if you were one of those competitors?  I can tell you what I&#x27;d do — I&#x27;d make my application free and build up the largest network I possibly could, knowing that the main value users get out of a communication app/network is the number of people on the network with whom they want to communicate (<i>cf.</i> <a href""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe&#x27;s_la"" rel""nofollo"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe&#x27;s_law</a>).<p>Since a player in this hypothetical SnapChat space could improve their situation by changing their strategy unilaterally, we see that the &quot;charge for SnapChat&quot; situation is not in a Nash equilibrium and it&#x27;d be irrational for us <i>not</i> to adopt this new strategy ourselves.<p>Of course, this <i>only works</i> when the new strategy is viable — in this case, the &quot;free for users&quot; strategy.  Because their marginal costs are much lower, it is significantly more viable for Snapchat than Everpix. Indeed, for Everpix it will just make their overall situation worse.",1389658501

7054509,comment,7053184,7054279,2,0,whatevsbro,,,"> If socialized models provide more expensive and poorer quality healthcare than systems with market forces involved, then it should be directly reflected in the American system being at least marginally better than the socialist systems. It is not. It is demonstrably far, far worse. Therefore, your argument continues to be flawed, despite your attempt to dodge the reality of facts. (I suppose you could argue that the American system of private insurers and private providers is somehow more socialist than any of the European systems. Good luck with that.)<p>I&#x27;m not dodging anything, and you saying so doesn&#x27;t make my argument flawed.<p>To make it more clear, it&#x27;s about <i>more</i> government involvement vs <i>less</i> government involvement. The only way the government <i>affects</i> an economy is through <i>coercion</i>: taxes, laws, regulations, licences and so on. Without government involvement, people would just do business however they wanted, and the corporations bribing politicians would actually have to engage in honest competition.<p>The less government involvement there is in X, the better X will be. It&#x27;s as simple as that. Obviously, the government is very much involved in the US healthcare system. There&#x27;s Medicare, Medicaid, and yes, all those insurance companies between the health care providers and their customers. Providers can charge <i>outrageous</i> fees for procedures because <i>their</i> customer doesn&#x27;t care - he&#x27;s not the one paying, after all. Often the patients aren&#x27;t even aware how much is being charged to their insurance companies, and if the patient himself is paying, the price is completely different. &quot;Oh you&#x27;re paying yourself?! Let me knock a zero off of that&quot;.<p>> As an aside, I reject your implicit assumption that &quot;customer service&quot; is the only thing that motivates good work.<p>You&#x27;re free to reject an implicit assumption I didn&#x27;t actually make, of course. The single biggest motivator for good work is <i>self-interest</i>, because your customer only pays you if he likes what he&#x27;s getting in exchange.<p>The way business works is through <i>benefiting its customers</i>, because otherwise they wouldn&#x27;t pay for its services. When exchanges are voluntary, <i>both</i> parties benefit. Your benefit is the profit you get from selling your services, and your customer&#x27;s benefit is whatever you do for him. As long as you&#x27;re doing business without any government involvement, you&#x27;ll simply have to keep pleasing your customers, lowering your costs / improving your productivity, and just overall maintaining a good level of quality. But all of this is predicated on the existence of competitors, and buying your services being <i>voluntary</i> - otherwise these mechanics don&#x27;t apply anymore, and then you get lower quality and higher costs. <i>This</i> was my argument, and it very much still stands. It&#x27;s based on human nature, the way we actually work, here in the real world.",1389658121
7054508,comment,7053873,7054222,4,0,stdgy,,,"It&#x27;s not &#x27;sort of irrelevant&#x27;. The entire thesis of many arguments against Google, and specifically the comment you made above, was that they distribute your personal information to advertisers and other corporate entities. That&#x27;s just not true.<p>Frankly, if they did that, they wouldn&#x27;t make very much money. They can demand money from advertisers because they have an information advantage over everyone else. That information advantage gives them an incentive to protect your personal information. After all, if they leaked the information a competitor could use it to formulate competitive advertising profiles, which would drive down earnings.<p>Edit:\nI wanted to add a few more thoughts since I let it spin around in my mind a bit. I think if you followed the line of argument regarding Google&#x27;s profit motive as a corporation, you could reach the conclusion that their users&#x27; privacy(that is, the distribution of their private information) is a prerogative of theirs to protect. Their viability as a corporation depends on their profiles being the most accurate, and on being under their sole ownership. As such, they are driven to protect them.<p>I would conjecture that the profit motive for their need to protect their information has led to their relatively robust consumer protection ratings by groups like the EFF[0].<p>--------------<p>0: <a href""https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-201"" rel""nofollo"">https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013</a>",1389658112

A search engine whose users consisted of the top 10,000 hackers and no one else would be in a very powerful position despite its small size, just as Google was when it was that search engine. And for the first time in over a decade the idea of switching seems thinkable to me.<p>Since anyone capable of starting this company is one of those 10,000 hackers, the route is at least straightforward: make the search engine you yourself want. Feel free to make it excessively hackerish. Make it really good for code search, for example. Would you like search queries to be Turing complete? Anything that gets you those 10,000 users is ipso facto good.</i><p>That suddenly got a lot easier, when excessively hackerish just means &quot;it&#x27;s not Google and doesn&#x27;t give a flying fuck about visitor stats&quot;. Imagine an artist writing their song without thinking about their audience - those are the best songs. Likewise, maybe surveying the market and doing what people want, instead of what you think they need, is a bit overrated, the road to mediocrity and ultimately failure. Well, I can hope ^^",1389658063

That was an ambitious project to promote a data standard, towards the goal of better efficiency through consumers&#x27; close monitoring of their own power usage. But it failed to gain traction in the industry and Google did not double down. Until now. It seems they may now think that it is better to make transparent decisions automatically rather than by providing information for the consumer to take action on themselves. Power consumption is a large opportunity and one that Google understands from its data centre operations. Certainly it is hard to justify the cost of Nest on its current portfolio and acqui-hire alone.",1389658004
