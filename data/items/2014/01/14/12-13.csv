Some kind of &quot;in the moment&quot; banter where accuracy is irrelevant is fun sometimes, sure, but it&#x27;s not the only mode of conversation, or to my mind the most interesting.<p>I have plenty of conversations that are both excellent conversations <i>and</i> come into necessary contact with facts. Sometimes the facts are purely from memory, but sometimes it&#x27;s useful to look them up, if one or both of us aren&#x27;t sure we remember them properly, or recognize a gap in our knowledge. A few topics in only the past week that benefited from looking up some facts: 1) talking with my parents about the circumstances under which my great-grandparents emigrated from Sweden; 2) discussing my uncle&#x27;s MS treatment/management with family; 3) having a friendly argument with a friend about promising directions in artificial intelligence; and 4) discussing similarities and differences between some aspects of Danish and American culture.<p>It&#x27;s not really a particularly new addition to conversation, either. Nowadays when you look something up it&#x27;s probably on the internet, but when I was younger, conversations would sometimes involve pulling a reference book off the shelf to add some context or a point of reference to the discussion (atlases especially, but occasionally an encyclopedia or almanac).",1389704184

It states that the cartesian product of infinitely many non-empty sets contains at least one element. So under the assumption that the axiom of choice is true, obviously, the product of non-empty sets cannot be empty, because that&#x27;s the definition of the axiom of choice.<p>Conversely, under the assumption that the axiom of choice is false, there must be some infinite collection of non-empty sets for which the cartesian product is empty.  Many people (like you!) find this absurd; thinking it&#x27;s absurd doesn&#x27;t indicate any problems with your intuition.<p>Now, there&#x27;s a saying about the axiom of choice:<p><pre><code>    The axiom of choice is obviously true,\n    the well-ordering principle is obviously false,\n    and who can tell about Zorn&#x27;s lemma?\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a joke; the three items mentioned are all known to be equivalent.<p>The axiom of choice is known to have equally &quot;absurd&quot; consequences.  One, referenced in the above joke, is that it is equivalent to the statement<p><pre><code>    All sets have a well-ordering\n</code></pre>\nWhich can be rephrased:<p><pre><code>    For any set S, all subsets of S contain a least element\n</code></pre>\nYou might want to reflect on what the least element of the open interval (0,1) would be.  (Note, &quot;least&quot; refers to the well-ordering of the set guaranteed to exist by the axiom of choice; it <i>does not</i> refer to the numeric sense in which 3 is less than 4.)<p>The axiom of choice also gives us the Banach-Tarski theorem, which says that a sphere can be divided into a finite number of pieces which can then be rearranged without deformation into two spheres of the same radius.<p>I generally lump anti-choice mathematicians into the same group as constructivists, but theoretically there could be a distinction.  There are no known consequences (outside of the various theorems proved using the axiom, all rather abstruse) to believing one way or the other, but it&#x27;s a rather emotional subject for many people.

The strange thing is that I rarely even chat on Skype. This should be tens of gigabytes of just text chat.

This is not the first, nor last, piece of software that uses ads in order to support its development.<p>Also, the extension never logged anything from the users. All the &quot;keylogger&quot; stuff is just rumors started by people who are either incapable of reading a sentence from start to end or are knowingly lying about it.<p>It didn&#x27;t alter the search results either. Those were exactly what Google returned for your search, nothing more, nothing less.<p>There was no malicious intent whatsoever. The whole purpose was to support further development of the extension through some form of advertising which you could disable at any point. The disable option was not even hidden among the other options; it had a dedicated page with a link in the main menu that only consisted of a checkbox - it was that simple and obvious.<p>Another false rumor is that the setting would enable itself automatically. No, it didn&#x27;t! The only way that it would re-enable itself was to remove the extension and then install it right back. On uninstall all settings are lost and it fallbacks to the defaults.<p>The source code is plain HTML & JavaScript and it has always been available for anyone to review. Anyone could download the .CRX file and unzip it (it&#x27;s just a <i>special</i> ZIP file) or take a look in the /%USER_FOLDER%/<PATH_TO_CHROME>/Extensions/kkelicaakdanhinjdeammmilcgefonfh folder (this varies based on your operating system) where the installed extension is.

That claim was made just to point out that in fact I do care about the users&#x27; privacy and I chose not to sell the extension, even though I received plenty of offers. Some people asked &quot;how could I even think of that&quot;? Well, the extension is my property and receiving all those offers put me in the position where I had to think about it, whether I liked it or not.<p>In conclusion, yes, I admit the opt-out pattern is not the friendliest one and the whole thing could have been handled in some other way, but the reality is far from all these claims that I sneakily added malware to the extension, logged your keys and private data and sell all that to third parties or whatever.<p>The reality is I took your Google search results and converted them to sponsored links, plain and simple. All data that was transmitted when you clicked a search result was about the same that is sent whenever you click on any other ad or banner, which can not, in any circumstances, be used to identify you personally.<p>I am the developer and this is my answer; no excuses, just stating the facts.

This forces the &quot;benevolent&quot; part. Developers can always stop contributing, fork, or start up a new project.<p>This isn&#x27;t the case with governments. Unchecked power ends up corrupting the ones holding the power in the majority of cases even if they start to govern with the aim to be benevolent. And you cannot stop contributing, fork or rewrite a society. Most dictatorships also try very hard to prevent their subjects from leaving their domain, because not participating and contributing is the ultimate act of disobedience.",1389700962
