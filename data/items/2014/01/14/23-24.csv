7060678,comment,7060261,7060261,8,0,jamesk_au,,,"One of the principal issues raised here - and not squarely addressed in the post or the article to which it links - is the extent to which average subjective ratings of courses and professors should be permitted to dominate the decision-making processes of students.<p>Note that Yale&#x27;s complaint included concerns over &quot;the prominence of class and professor ratings&quot;, and the student developers&#x27; response was to remove &quot;the option of sorting classes by ratings&quot;.  Subjective five-point ratings can be useful in many contexts, but in the context of education they can also give rise to genuine pedagogical concerns about the way in which students choose their courses.<p>Looking at the screenshot in the post, it is not difficult to see that the pattern of enrolments might very quickly become skewed towards those classes with higher average evaluation ratings (whatever such ratings might mean).  If that happens, it suggests that some students may be making decisions about the courses in which they enrol based principally on factors other than their interests, abilities and future career paths,  or without critical thought.  Whilst other factors are relevant, including those for which an average of subjective evaluation ratings might be a plausible heuristic, that does not mean those factors should be the primary or predominant factors.<p>Without seeking to defend or condone Yale&#x27;s response, there is more to the story than the tale of student censorship presented in the post.",1389743723

7060673,comment,7060385,7060385,19,0,leknarf,,,"Great article overall. I particularly liked the three mistakes you pointed out:<p><i>I nickled-and-dimed a client on change requests, alienating that client and making myself appear less professional. ...  I would have been better served by her loving me than making a little more money.</i><p>I completely agree. In fact, this is part of the reason new freelancers often regret setting their hourly rate too low. It&#x27;s important that you set a high enough rate that you can throw in unbillable work now and then without destroying your earnings. The best freelancers consistently under-promise and over-deliver.<p><i>For pricing my services, I need to start high and work my way down. I generally start client conversations on my hourly rate at what I would consider a reasonable ultimate number, and then allow myself to be driven down from there — generally because the client wants a long-term contract and expects to save on my hourly based on the length of the engagement.</i><p>Constant haggling will make every new project a frustrating experience. I usually recommend setting a fair rate and then holding the line when clients ask for a discount. That&#x27;s tough to do with your first few projects, but becomes easier once you&#x27;re more confident about your rate and abilities.<p><i>More projects, less hourly. When starting as a consultant, I was really selling only my hours. Now Symonds & Son is a business in its own right, and I’ve hired designers and developers to help with my workload. Working with other talented individuals makes much more sense on a project basis, where I can package their (and my) hours together.</i><p>This depends on what type of projects you&#x27;re looking to take on. Landing pages and presentation work will probably pay more if you charge per project (since clients won&#x27;t believe you can more 10x faster than cheaper devs), but building new product features for startups is probably better at an hourly rate (since startup clients always change what they&#x27;re looking to build).<p>If anyone is looking to get started as a freelancer/consultant or just looking to expand their existing business, take a look at our startup: <a href""http://getlambda.co"" rel""nofollo"">http://getlambda.com</a>.",1389743646

This is just nuts!<p>This might work for some snazzy valley startup with 16 people all working on the same code base, but this is just completely, shall I say, naive and shortsighted. It smacks of someone who hasn&#x27;t been involved in anything big, complex or been in the industry for any length of time.<p>Some people don&#x27;t like to use sports analogies, but I do so I will.<p>An NFL team typically has a head coach, an offensive coordinator, a defensive coordinator, a special teams coach, QB/WR/RB/DB/LB/Oline/Dline coach as well as a strength coach, among some more in certain cases. Then there are the players. Offensive, defensive, special teams.<p>Imagine you are the head coach. Should you spend 30% of your time doing ANYTHING any of the players are doing? Should the OC or DC being doing the drills or what not? Maybe, maybe working out, but probably not like the players.<p>My position is akin to the OC on an NFL team. I&#x27;m in charge of teams of teams of people. Developers (in different areas/focuses), QA, infra, release, ops etc etc. This is LOTS of people. So, if I&#x27;m &quot;coding&quot; 30% of my time, I&#x27;m effectively looking at only one area. Should I be spending 30% (or some % number) of my time doing jobs in those other areas? And do I want my managers in those areas to do those things? Well, probably not. I want them to understand them, yes, have done that job previously, yes. More over, I want someone who can 1. engage the team 2. direct the team 3. hold the team responsible 4. tell me (or others) &quot;no&quot; and intelligently show the way for their area and 5. lead up and down. Coding is literally so far down the list it isn&#x27;t funny.<p>So, no, a manager shouldn&#x27;t be coding 30% of their time. If they want to and it doesn&#x27;t get in the way of their actual job, fine, but that is not their job. Their job is to set or enact direction, lead and protect their team.<p>To go back to the NFL example. If I&#x27;m the head coach, I want the OC to know exactly the type of offense I want to run, put in the system in place, coach the coaches on that system and make sure everyone is on the same page. I don&#x27;t want them running routes with the WR or practicing blocking drills with the linemen.",1389743414

When I said happily I meant this definition: &quot;felicitously; aptly; appropriately&quot;. Meaning they pay because that&#x27;s what they are supposed to do. My bad. What they want and what they do are two different things. You see, they don&#x27;t want to pay for multiple copies but they do, not because of DRM. They do so because that&#x27;s what they are &quot;supposed&quot; to do. This is more of a philosophical, economical, and/or legal issue they complain about, not technological.

I&#x27;m not talking streaming or torrenting content. There are areas of the world where you can buy a perfect copy of a DVD or Blu-Ray for very little and the original content owners get nothing.

7060580,comment,7055226,7059477,1,0,TheLoneWolfling,,,"> Why do you assume AI will rely on hardware so extensively and not work in software?<p>Three reasons:<p>First, hardware is <i>much</i> faster than software. By the time you&#x27;ve built a virtual machine of some sort you&#x27;re talking about (an) order(s) of magnitude performance loss. We&#x27;re still speed-limited in how accurately we can emulate the SNES, for example. Sure, there are cases where it is not too bad of a performance loss, but in the case of something like an AI, I would have to assume that a large chunk of the &quot;core&quot; AI would be self-modifying in some form, and self-modifying code just <i>kills</i> most interpreters/JITters.<p>Second, any sufficiently complex software <i>will</i> have bugs. And in the case of something like an AI, I would have to assume that a large chunk of the &quot;core&quot; AI would be self-modifying in some form, and as such will probably hit upon some undocumented feature/&quot;feature&quot;/bug of the sandbox and start relying on something instance-specific. Machine learning algorithms make <i>great</i> fuzzers. (I know - I&#x27;ve actually had this happen myself. Was working on a fairly simple robot arena machine-learning &quot;demo&quot;, and the winning robot exploited a bug in the arena to mess up other robots. (Fairly basic stack-based VM, robots could run X virtual instruction subticks in a game tick. Some instructions took multiple subticks, and there was a bug where starting an instruction [number of subticks in the instruction]-1 subticks from the end of your turn would execute the instruction on your opponent&#x27;s turn, pushing it onto their stack.)<p>And third, I don&#x27;t see how one could build something that doesn&#x27;t at some point rely on hardware. Virtual machines still leak data via timing attacks. For that matter, what will you do about I/O? How do you know that the AI isn&#x27;t relying on the noise on the wall in the background of the webcam for some internal subroutine?<p>> You pull the plug on the hardware.<p>Which immediately wipes all data in RAM and data encoded in the current processor state / current GPU state / etc. Great idea!",1389742590

Their brains would be literally running twice as fast, they would be having twice as many experiences and thoughts in the same amount of real time.

However, it&#x27;s the job of the Senior Developer to represent the engineering concerns of the team. It&#x27;s the job of the Manager type to sit between the Engineering Team and the Senior Management, deal with paperwork nightmares, prioritize major work units, set deadlines and manage both up and down.<p>The Senior Dev should sit at a high level of the actual business of the engineering, dip down from time to time to spot shoot thorny issues, but they should prioritize the specific engineering items and keep the team well fed with work. It <i>is</i> a management function, with expertise in very hard engineering problems.<p>Sometimes the Senior Developer might represent that some work item is problematic for whatever reason and try and keep the team off of it. The manager, knowing the strategic priorities of the upper management, can either chose to manage this up, or override the Senior Dev and manage this down depending on the situation.<p>This is something that Senior developers aren&#x27;t in a position to understand. Representing only engineering up means that unpleasant shit work is often just not done.

Here&#x27;s my #1 piece:<p><i>Slow the fuck down!</i><p>You don&#x27;t &quot;win&quot; at public speaking by getting more words in. In fact, you&#x27;ll likely lose your audience by going a mile a minute. It makes perfect sense, but it&#x27;s still <i>hard</i> to do. You can practice your talk in private a hundred times and it&#x27;ll be X minutes.  You can present your talk to colleagues and co-workers and it&#x27;ll be X minutes.  Then, when you get in front of a room full of strangers, the adrenaline will hit, you&#x27;ll go into manic-caffeine-squirrel mode, and you&#x27;ll blast it out in X/2 minutes!  Some people deliberately make their talks too long, knowing they&#x27;ll finish early if they don&#x27;t.  This is a mistake.  They&#x27;re just cramming too much material into the time allowed and will shell-shock their audience. Slow the fuck down!<p>The method by which you slow the fuck down is going to be somewhat personal.  Different things work for different people.  Personally, I do a lot better if I&#x27;ve gotten to know even just a few people in the room a tiny bit.  If I can get a few people (hopefully in the front row) into the colleague-zone, I can focus on them during the talk and ignore the strangers.",1389741340
