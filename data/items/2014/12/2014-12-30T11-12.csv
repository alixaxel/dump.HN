degree.  If a CS degree, or STEM degree seems unattainable 
get a BS, or BA in Anything.  You will look back on the experience with a smile on your face.  At most state colleges upper division courses are easier than lower division--I don&#x27;t know why, but that was my experience.
I have to say though--I&#x27;m a little surprised how many people 
on this board still value the four year degree?  It seems 
like every Programming employment offer goes out of their way to make sure the applicant is fully aware that 
experience, and a portfolio of work is more important than 
a degree.  The only reason I got a four year degree is because in the US certain people still think it&#x27;s a big deal?  I learned more at my community college than I did 
at state college.  It was cheaper, I learned more,  the Teachers care more, and the classes were small.  I actually had a great time at my community college.  I was completely 
dissillusioned with graduate school, and a short stint in Chiropractic school though.  Good luck--don&#x27;t forget applying to to construction unions--if you don&#x27;t mind hard
