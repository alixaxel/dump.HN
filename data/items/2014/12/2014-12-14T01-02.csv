About five years ago I did a bunch of work testing consumer GPU memory for reliability [1, 2]. Because until that time GPUs were primarily used for error-tolerant applications (graphics) storing only short-lived data (textures) in memory, there wasn&#x27;t a whole lot of pressure to make sure the memory was as reliable as that found on the main system board. We found that indeed, there was a persistent, low level of memory errors that could be triggered depending on access pattern. I haven&#x27;t followed up for recent generations, but the fact that the &quot;professional&quot; GPGPU boards both clock their memory slower and include hardware ECC is possible cause for concern with leaving anything too important on the GPU for a long time.<p>There&#x27;s code [3,4], too, but I haven&#x27;t actively worked on it in a few years, so no guarantees on how well it runs nowadays...<p>[1] <a href=""http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ihaque/papers/gpuser.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ihaque/papers/gpuser.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ihaque/talks/gpuser_lacss_oct_2010.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ihaque/talks/gpuser_lacss_oct_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/ihaque/memtestG80"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ihaque/memtestG80</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/ihaque/memtestCL"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ihaque/memtestCL</a>",1418521948

8747181,comment,8745540,8747018,0,0,rockmeamedee,,,"The reason I don&#x27;t want to think of everyone as human beings first is this:<p>Everyone is part of an arbitrary collective of traits (most of us here are white, male, American, etc) and each trait affects how we see each other. For example, women are seen as more caring, or bitchy if they have power, whatever. Those stereotypes are bad, and we can&#x27;t ignore that they still happen.<p>The way we get rid of these biases things is by recognizing that when we think a woman is being bitchy (or, say a black man angry) it&#x27;s likely to be our ingrained sexism (/racism). Seeing people as human beings first erases their identities and _removes the opportunity to fix our prejudices_. You and I are both prejudiced, we have to recognize that, and work to remove it from our minds.<p>Then, on the optimism/pessimism thing. Just keep on investigating the experiences of black people and I think you might become less optimistic about where we are.<p>It&#x27;s sometimes tough to see how other people could be disadvantaged (that&#x27;s called privilege). But when this list of benefits white people have over black people <a href=""http://amptoons.com/blog/files/mcintosh.html#daily"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amptoons.com/blog/files/mcintosh.html#daily</a> doesn&#x27;t hold any more, _then_ we can get rid of black history month.<p>We can&#x27;t overcorrect yet, because, broadly, our institutions themselves are still racist.

8747166,comment,8746054,8746054,0,0,userbinator,,,"This is amazingly elegant and concise. I&#x27;ve heard a lot of people, including the compiler academics, claim that even the simplest non-optimising compiler for x86 would be extremely complex; this is a great counterexample to that, alongside (O)TCC. It looks like it&#x27;s using mainly two registers only for code generation, eax and ecx, and the stack.<p>Jack Crenshaw&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s build a compiler&quot; tutorial series uses the same code generation method but with eax/edx (<a href=""http://www.pp4s.co.uk/main/tu-trans-comp-jc-intro.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pp4s.co.uk/main/tu-trans-comp-jc-intro.html</a> ); not sure if he was the first one to come up with it, however. Incidentally, I think his tutorial series is one of the best ones I&#x27;ve read for understanding how compilers work, even better than all the &quot;traditional&quot; literature like the Dragon Book.<p>The other article that&#x27;ll probably be very helpful for those understanding how the rest of this compiler works is <a href=""http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm#climbing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Misc/exp_parsing.htm#climbing</a> which describes the &quot;precedence climbing&quot; way of parsing expressions.<p>Compilers are often thought of as &quot;magic&quot; that only very few people can understand, but I don&#x27;t think that has to be true in general. While &quot;production-quality&quot; compilers like gcc are certainly very complex, the <i>essence</i> of a compiler is really quite simple. However, this wouldn&#x27;t be the impression one gets by reading a lot of the compiler books out there --- the heavy emphasis on theory in the majority of them has a somewhat obfuscating effect. They also tend to focus a lot more on compiler-compilers (Lex, Yacc) and more general parsing techniques like LR, while spending very little on the simple methods of syntax-directed translation and recursive descent. AFAIK precedence-climbing is not even described in the Dragon Book.",1418521109

Masonry layouts make things much more difficult. That being said, one of the benchmarks in that article mentioned toggling visibility improving performance (not what they settled on, but still a significant gain). This is what I was able to implement. We had to query the DOM to detect when an image in the feed was moving in and out of the screen with a buffer equal to screen height. With this in place, users could paginate 50+ times without trouble (at a solid framerate), though they would&#x27;ve eventually hit problems if they kept scrolling too long.<p><i>TLDR;</i> I hate masonry layouts for performance reasons.",1418520391
