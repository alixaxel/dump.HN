As a consultant I usually have dealt with the latter, and that usually goes hand in hand with a poorly designed XML schema.<p>One space that XSLT can demonstrate its strength is when transforming some horribly serialized interoperability data structure. If the system from which you are receiving data, produces terse XML, you aren&#x27;t going to solve anything by rewriting the upstream system to produce equally lousy JSON. If you don&#x27;t have the ability to fix the upstream service to produce better structured data, XSLT and XPath are wonderful tools to morph it into something more manageable. That transformation process is better written with XSLTs than it is in trying to do the same thing by slurping the data directly into some business object and trying then to work with a bad model. Don&#x27;t go down the path of &quot;garbage out, garbage in.&quot;<p>If you have access to both sides of the process, it might be worth rewriting the upstream system, but when working with a legacy system XSLT might be the best glue technology in your arsenal.",1417870163

  28 + [anything,  3, 0, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3]
              00, 11,00,11,10,11,10,11,11,10,11,10,11

   reverse:   11,10,11,10,11,11,10,11,10,11,00,11, 00
            0011  1011  1011  1110  1110  1100   1100
          0x   3     b     b     e     e     c      c   
</code></pre>
We have 4 possible values in the array, so we need 2 bits per value. We have one dummy value + 12 required values, so we need a total of 2*13 = 26 bits which fits easily into a 4 byte integer (either 32 bits unsigned or 31 bits signed). To retrieve one element from the &quot;array&quot;, we need to shift our constant 2 bits per month or twice by the numer of months. Then we need to mask everything but the lowest 2 bits (&3).",1417868291

I&#x27;ve seen the guts of a large PHP system, and while it was still re-inventing the wheel all over the place, they had still solved all of their problems and had established practices that encouraged stable business.  Not interesting, but neither are consolidate businesses to begin with.<p>PHP will cease to be gross when it&#x27;s not just the large implementations that are very nicely done.  This is not the PHP that exists in the vast seas between these islands.  PHP is not something that a rotational employee or someone who is career-conscious will choose or accept for long.  They want to work at your company for a while.  This can be good.  PHP is a career limiter in a way and I think the cringe reaction is a natural tendency to want to open up the conversation to see if what could be a good rotational job is also a toolchain dead end.  Career conscious programmers don&#x27;t want dead ends.<p>The gripe is and always will be that PHP encourages bad practices because it includes a bunch of &quot;features&quot; that are undeniably prone to bad habits.  It&#x27;s not personal.  Really, we don&#x27;t want companies using PHP well to die.  We don&#x27;t want the programmers using PHP to go away.  We want PHP to stay put because better tools are out there, and anything that perpetuates the use of PHP in <i>new</i> products feels gross.  It feels especially gross to the career-conscious young ones.  Sorry.",1417867451
