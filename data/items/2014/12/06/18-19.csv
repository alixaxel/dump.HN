For years, there was a lot of complaining about the costs of each service demanding to have its own designs because it was special and the Marines couldn&#x27;t possibly make do with a plane designed for the Air Force, etc. etc.<p>Unfortunately, the history of trying to make merged designs isn&#x27;t great. Differences in missions (and, frankly, the fact that those missions have been changing in many cases) seem to lead to designs that cost too much, don&#x27;t do most tasks especially well, and take too long to design and build.",1417892340

8709854,comment,8708844,8709325,0,0,oafitupa,,,"&quot;One could argue that a block chain fork could invalidate an arbitrary number of blocks at any time, and therefore the Bitcoin protocol does not by itself have this property of being able to tell which transactions really happened.&quot;<p>No, one could not argue that. The economic majority will decide which fork is valid. That&#x27;s the opposite of centralization.<p>&quot;To limit the number of blocks that could be invalidated in this way, the bitcoin reference implementation contains checkpoint hashes. These are indeed decided centrally.<p>If you accept the core assumption in bitcoin that an attacker will never control a majority of the hashing power, then there probably isn&#x27;t a problem and the checkpoint s aren&#x27;t needed.&quot;<p>You fail to realize you are not forced to download anything you don&#x27;t want to. And the checkpoints are hundreds of blocks deep. They don&#x27;t decide anything the network hasn&#x27;t already decided (6 blocks deep transactions are considered practically irreversible). The checkpoints ARE needed as an anti-DOS measure (they protect the storage of full nodes from being flooded by forks that could suddenly start to appear at low block numbers).

He evaluates his claim by the criterion he&#x27;s railing against: &quot;See?&quot; he seems to say. &quot;IBM tried to maximize shareholder value and J&J didn&#x27;t, and J&J&#x27;s stock did better! Therefore maximizing shareholder value is stupid!&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure where on the list of world&#x27;s stupidest ideas to put this idea that you can judge a measuring stick by using it to measure its advocates. All Montier has succeeded in demonstrating is that (a) the goal of maximizing shareholder value is so sacrosanct that even someone trying to undermine that goal naturally identifies good results with high share prices and bad with low; and that (b) Montier is really not arguing against the goal of maximizing shareholder value at all, but against the idea that explicitly trying to do so is effective.<p>And it does seem that maximizing shareholder value is a sort of financial anti-Heisenbug: don&#x27;t worry about it and there&#x27;s no problem, but the more intently you focus on it, the worse things get.",1417891545

Go actually gets this thing right, but is bare bones in every other regard (which I also appreciate, I enjoy Rob Pike&#x27;s work).<p>I can&#x27;t really think of any solution to this dilemma, though. Fundamentally, it&#x27;s not just limitations of languages, but of operating systems, as well.

In particular phones don&#x27;t have giant displays, so it&#x27;s usually a waste of bandwidth to send a huge picture to a phone as part of a webpage.  And, speaking only for mobile Firefox at the time I worked on it, we had lots of bigger problems with large images than decoding speed.  For example, Firefox would keep the whole decoded image in memory while it was onscreen, even if it was only displaying only part of the image or only a downsampled version of the image.  If it&#x27;s a giant image, the decoded image could use up a large fraction of the device&#x27;s memory.<p>I&#x27;m also not aware of any major phones with have GPGPUs -- I&#x27;m not an expert in this stuff, but I think you&#x27;d need that to get any serious acceleration from JPEG decoding.",1417890568

If the majority of nodes agree than the hard fork was successful.

It&#x27;s functional language if you squint at it, sort of. Maybe. It certainly doesn&#x27;t fit with the most broadly acceptable (stricter) definitions of what a functional language is.<p>The biggest problem, with XSLT 1 at least (and that&#x27;s primarily what I&#x27;m talking about because that&#x27;s what exists in the wild), is that the output of a template function is a string, whereas the input is a node tree. So to get generalised recursion or perform function composition over the input data, you need to do some evil tricks.<p>To give the impression of Turing completeness, you need to first parse the input stream by splitting it up into strings and then call functions that perform string processing, which means you can no longer use xpath, or any of the things that really make XSLT. At that point you&#x27;re not really writing XSLT anymore, you&#x27;re doing simple recursive string processing using XSLT as a horrendously overweight and improperly-equipped wrapper around your native string libraries.<p>Incidentally, I don&#x27;t accept the linked article as a proof of Turing completeness, since it only implements some trivial programs using Turing machines. That&#x27;s not the same thing as proving equivalence with a universal Turing machine. However, others seem to have done it, presumably using tricks such as string processing, or ignoring the input altogether.<p>You could for instance, recreate Conway&#x27;s Game of Life using pure XSLT, but it wouldn&#x27;t contain any actual XML transformation code and all the state would exist in the running XSLT program, not the XML document. It would also blow the stack as most XSLT engines don&#x27;t support tail recursion and there&#x27;s no other way to loop indefinitely.<p>What you certainly can&#x27;t do is have one function that outputs a set of XML nodes and another function that has a for-each that consumes that set, or have the ability to run apply-templates over it. That is nothing like functional programming.",1417889081

Due to the way the aircraft was designed, it has very limited upgradeability compared to most US military aircraft.<p>The real reason is that it has always been the red-headed step-child of the ch-Air Force. There has never been any real interest in the CAS role from the mgmt, other than to keep that turf away from the Army and Marine Corps.<p>>While the airframe still makes for a great weapons platform, the sensor suites, avionics, and countermeasures are obsolete, and not in a good way. They&#x27;ve been doing a lot of nasty hacks to allow it to support modern weapon systems and electronics but there are a growing number of important capabilities that simply cannot be &quot;backported&quot; to that airframe.<p>I was about to make a similar comment that the A10 performs its role well despite having relatively primitive weapons / targeting systems. But I disagree about the reason for the obsolete weapons / electronics. Sensors and computers have only gotten smaller and better, and I am afraid I don&#x27;t understand why you think that the A10 cannot be fitted with proper electronics and sensors.<p>>This has been increasing its vulnerability to more advanced threats<p>The definition of a CAS role practically implies that the airplane can only operate in an arena where air-superiority is assured. The A10 is by definition vulnerable to &quot;more advanced threats&quot; and so will any acceptable substitute share similar vulnerabilities.<p>>Its shelf-life has been extended by virtue of it being used in practice against adversaries with unsophisticated weaponry.<p>Exactly the kind of adversary it is being deployed against, though it has proven itself against others as well.<p>>It is a relic of the Cold War not just in its history but, unfortunately, also in its defenses and weaponry with no obvious upgrade path. To replace it with something that could support the capabilities they desire, they would need to design a completely new airframe.<p>I agree, and I hope they call it the A10-mkII, and that it is practically a modern rebuild of the A10.",1417889056

Obviously the ecosystem does make a huge difference to how productive someone can be in any given programming language, and the choices of language that projects are making are perfectly rational given their constraints and objectives.<p>It&#x27;s just unfortunate that this creates momentum behind languages like C, PHP and JavaScript, which then concentrates the effort of library development within their ecosystems, creating a vicious cycle. In terms of robustness and productivity, the industry would be better served by moving almost all development work away from that sort of underpowered, poorly specified, error-prone <i>language</i> as soon as possible, but you can&#x27;t do that without the <i>libraries</i>. Developing that ecosystem for any new language takes huge amounts of time and effort, so to have any realistic chance of catching on, you first need an excellent bridge to existing libraries. Sadly, the FFI infrastructure even in relatively good languages tends to be clunky at best, and that is a huge barrier to adoption for all the reasons you mentioned.<p><i>Starting off from first principles can be quite impractical these days, so stitching together others&#x27; work is becoming a common paradigm.</i><p>On the other hand, the trade-off for that reduction in NIH early development effort is that you now have a discovery problem up-front and a dependency management problem indefinitely. I don&#x27;t think that as an industry we&#x27;ve really found a good balance yet between not reinventing the wheel and not spending forever choosing which of 57 pre-existing wheels to use.<p>What I&#x27;d love to see is a new generation of languages that accept the modern reality of combining packages from diverse sources and so place much greater emphasis on supporting that kind of software architecture. Interoperability between packages, each with their own related but probably slightly different concepts and conventions, needs to be much more of a priority IMHO. When we can compose data structures and algorithms across packages from different sources, and have all the marshalling and type safety and error handling mechanisms just work with minimal programmer intervention, then we&#x27;ll be getting somewhere. But of course that&#x27;s just one more substantial issue that any new language has to address on top of everything else, which is no small thing to ask.",1417888826
