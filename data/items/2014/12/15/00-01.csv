Intel x86 toolsets were available. Still, though, it didn&#x27;t matter much because there was no market.<p>-So Intel gave away their chips. By the tens of millions. These chips are actually quite excellent (great performance, 64-bit, great graphics, low power consumption), but knowing that they were on the outside looking in, they gave them away.<p>The Android ecosystem now is one where x86 (and soon x86-64) is as supported as ARM is.

Gender Dysphoria, the condition associated with transgender individuals, is most likely neurological in nature - that is to say, there are plenty of studies correlating sex-atypical differences in the brain with gender dysphoria. (<a href=""http://transcience-project.org/brain_sex.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://transcience-project.org/brain_sex.html</a>)<p>Lumping in cross-dressers and run-of-the-mill gender variance denies this very real condition the attention it deserves, it reduces it to a choice. There is nothing wrong with the choice, and people should have the right to express their gender however they choose, I just think that we need to be careful about maintaining a separation between gender dysphoria and gender variance.<p>On the actual question at hand, clinical intake studies have been pretty consistent in this regard. The number of people who have gender dysphoria that becomes severe enough to prompt treatment (in western European countries) is about 1:10000 (for transgender women) and 1:27000 (for transgender men). (Judge, Ciaran, Claire O&#x27;Donovan, and Donal O&#x27;Shea. &quot;Gender dysphoria-prevalence and co-morbidities in an Irish adult population.&quot; Neuroendocrine Science 5 (2014): 87)<p>That being said it is difficult to estimate the number of individuals with gender dysphoria who choose not to seek treatment (or those who choose to self medicate). People like John are unfortunate, and a hopefully the bi-product of an age we are on our way out of. That being said, John is clearly not transgender, they may suffer from gender dysphoria, but they are not transgender.<p>Today we have a much better understanding of gender dysphoria and have a number of long term studies which show hormonal and surgical transitioning to be an effective treatment (e.g Gorin-Lazard, A., Baumstarck, K., Boyer, L., Maquigneau, A., Gebleux, S., Penochet, J.-C., Pringuey, D., Albarel, F., Morange, I., Loundou, A., Berbis, J., Auquier, P., Lançon, C. and Bonierbale, M.

LEO requires about 7.8 km/s velocity while mach 5 is 1.7 km/s. In one case you accelerate from 0 to 7.8 km/s an in the other from 1.7 to 7.8 (for 6.1 km/s delta-v). The first figure gives a mass ratio of 5.9 while the second one gives you ratio of 4.0. You save about 1/3 of the initial mass if you only have to burn on a closed cycle from Mach 5 upwards.<p>In reality gravity is a tough mistress so actual rockets launching from a pad require about 9.0 km/s delta-v because they lose a substantial amount due to the gravity losses of climbing up from Earth&#x27;s gravity well. This is especially true for the first few km&#x27;s of altitude where the thrust-to-mass ratio is quite low. Potentially, the skylon will eliminate most of those gravity losses by effectively launching from 26km altutude at mach 5 (i&#x27;m ignoring the relatively modest fuel consumption for reaching this state - the specific impulse is about 3500).<p>Assuming a delta-v of 9.0 km/s needed for a single stage rocket gives a mass ratio of 7.7.

For unambitious people, this sort of thing is the dreaded &quot;failure to launch,&quot; but for the ambitious ones it can be an incomparably valuable sort of exploration. If you start a startup at 20 and you&#x27;re sufficiently successful, you&#x27;ll never get to do it. &quot;<p>I largely agree with his perspective. If you are naturally finding yourself at a &#x27;break&#x27; (eg, finishing your degree) and you know it&#x27;s something you want to do, I&#x27;d recommend doing it given it will only get harder to do later. Maybe if you aren&#x27;t fully confident, try limiting your risk by committing to travel for a shorter period of time (eg, 3 months) then re-evaluate the value you feel you&#x27;re getting from the travel to see if you should extend for another 3 months.<p>Traveling is hard to quantify the value for because you often won&#x27;t see the benefits for a long time - it will often subtly affect your perspective in small but important ways over decades by increasing your general human empathy and understanding.

8750066,comment,8749605,8749981,0,0,pwnna,,,"Some background: This company&#x27;s engine is based on its previous design, the SABRE engine. That engine is designed to reach an altitude at 28km, flying at Mach 5 (which works out to be about 1.5km/s at that altitude, ~15% of orbital velocity at LEO). After that the engine is designed to switch to a rocket mode, where it burns fuel and oxygen it brought, rather than taking it from the atmosphere.<p>Since the an air breathing engine is much more efficient (10x) than a traditional rocket engine, it allows the launch vehicle to conserve mass that would otherwise be used to overcome the high drag encountered in lower altitudes. You can roughly think of this as a rocket with all of its mass being launched at 28km, with a velocity of Mach 5 already.<p>&quot;Getting out of the atmosphere&quot; is a pretty vague statement. Atmospheric pressure and density is about 1-2% that of the ground. So drag at these altitudes will be less. However, some quick and dirty calculations by me makes this seem like a relatively small number compared to the amount of energy it takes to actually get to orbit. Quick search indicates the same as well[1].<p>However, a &quot;thick&quot; atmosphere is something that has to be dealt with. For example, rockets also need to overcome pressures that exists at lower altitudes. If you take a look at any rocket launch videos, you will notice that the exhaust at higher altitudes (typically about 2-3 minutes after launch) will expand outwards with respect to the rocket itself. This means that the flow out of the rocket engine is &quot;underexpanded&quot;, making the engine less efficient than it would be otherwise. By starting your rocket engine at a higher altitude, you can improve the efficiencies by designing your rockets to lower atmospheric pressures (I don&#x27;t know if this is done for the SABRE engine, but this is theoretically possible).<p>So based on these, the main motivation for this is <i>probably</i> for the mass savings and efficiency. Additionally, this engine presents itself with potentials for complete reusability, which is very attractive as most current launch cost is from the unrecoverable launch vehicle itself.<p>[1]: forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=9959.msg189860#msg189860",1418602150

The apparently common belief that &quot;designer drugs&quot; shouldn&#x27;t be &quot;illegal&quot; is certainly not supported by the article.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what makes it so hard for some people to grasp the intrinsic dangers of ingesting &quot;designer&quot; drugs.  Our physiology is complex and quirky, rendering all drugs capable of unpredictably causing serious side effects.  And even if that&#x27;s a rare event, in the case of barely (or not at all) studied compounds, it&#x27;s still like playing pistol roulette with live rounds.<p>There&#x27;s risk for the chemist too.  While we might admire the skill to design and synthesize a novel compound, it&#x27;s foolish to do so outside of a fully equipped and qualified lab to assure safety for the chemist as well as the environment.  Of course, working in such a lab would no doubt imply a level of scrutiny about what the chemist is trying to do.<p>So obviously a designer drug is likely to be produced in conditions that don&#x27;t favor purity and careful testing.  It&#x27;s no wonder there are tragic outcomes, but it seems human nature to try to do something &quot;against the rules&quot;.  But it&#x27;s an entirely different matter when rules are the &quot;laws&quot; of legislatures vs. the laws of Mother Nature.  She never cares what we &quot;believe&quot; or desire.<p>Designer drugs will continue to be a problem.  The best we can hope for is that bad outcomes will yield here and there a clue to something useful.  It&#x27;s a shame, seems so often we have to learn the hard way.",1418601858

Without really knowing the TI-BASIC language and lacking the link cable, I remember some time when I was in the library typing a Mandelbrot set program line for line from the computer, trying to figure out where all those random tokens were located.  Once I finally got that working, I was hooked and started making all sort of different programs.<p>Some of the early programs I remember creating were mostly math programs and algorithms I learned from classes.  But very soon I started getting into gaming.  I had always wanted to make really cool games, but I always ended up limited by the capabilities of the calculator, and ended up mostly producing puzzle games; Minesweeper, Sudoku, Skyscrapers, etc.  I also managed to make a text adventure and an &#x27;AI&#x27; chat bot.<p>I wondered how people were able to make some of the more advanced games and eventually stumbled upon assembly.  It took me a really long time to grasp all the concepts and it was very frustrating.  Every instruction has a bunch of side effects, you have to remember what every register is holding at every point in time, and you have to memorize all the mnemonics.  I was also annoyed that I couldn&#x27;t program it on the go (Mimas didn&#x27;t exist at the time) but that certainly didn&#x27;t stop me!  With nothing better to do during that bus ride to and from school, I actually printed out all the op-codes, ram locations, bcalls, ascii tables, token tables, and would literally type in the hexadecimal into the calculator to program!  It was insane and really dangerous, constantly deleting the memory every time I typed a wrong character or forgot about the endianess.  I eventually just gave up on that and stuck with programming assembly games on the computer in my free time.<p>By the time I learned enough assembly to produce my first full game, a PacMan clone, it was around the end of high school and it was then that I decided that I really wanted to make it easier for people like myself to be able to make actually good games on the go.  It wasn&#x27;t until a year later that I started creating Axe Parser for that purpose.  Although I didn&#x27;t have any formal experience with compilers, languages, or other relevant theory I started anyway, just doing what I figured would work best.  It actually managed to succeed and after only a month of work, I was able to program a full game in about an hour!  It was exactly what I wished had existed when I was in school, and it&#x27;s super exciting to see there are students out there now that actually have this power and are making awesome stuff!  Its even more thrilling when it influences people to get into coding more seriously.  Warms my heart every time I see things like this :)<p>As for me now, I haven&#x27;t touched z80 programming for a few years now.
