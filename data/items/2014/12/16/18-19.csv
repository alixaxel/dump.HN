We preserve the old copies for 30 days so you can &quot;roll back time&quot; up to 30 days (like if you edit a document but want to revert).<p>For files larger than 30 MBytes we break them into 10 MByte chunks and only transmit the chunks that have changed.  So the worst case is you insert 1 byte at the very start of the large file - this effectively changes EVERY 10 MByte chunk and we transmit it all.  The best case is you append 1 byte to the end of the large file, because then we only have to transmit that one chunk.",1418756275

8758597,comment,8756710,8758070,0,0,talmand,,,"I disagree. They are an immigrant to the country and they entered illegally, therefore they are an illegal immigrant. I fail to see how that&#x27;s an inaccurate description.<p>Switching from illegal to undocumented can be attributed to the effort to downplay such people&#x27;s involvement in what is essentially a crime. I have read the reasoning behind such a change, that illegal criminalizes the person and not their actions. Which seems to be what you are saying. But the term does in fact name their actions, immigrating illegally, and not just the person. The person committed an illegal act, it is not unwarranted to name them as such. It is simply an attempt to separate the person from the action, which you cannot since the person committed the action.<p>As for your example. I would agree that in some instances such a person could be described as an illegal driver. Not for a minor offense, but if they committed an act that the law then barred them from operating a motor vehicle then they would indeed be an illegal driver if they later drive. Much like an immigrant is barred from entering the country outside of legal means.<p>To reverse your logic, bank robbers can just be described as undocumented withdrawers.

If the statute can stand as is, then perhaps the right to bear arms is less central to the constitutional pantheon than its most zealous advocates would have us believe.&quot;<p><i>In the Preamble to the Constitution, the phrase &quot;the people&quot; clearly refers to the political community creating the new government, which arguably excludes illegal aliens.</i><p>This would seem to also exclude citizens who do not vote or hold office.

Everything is electronic: filing and docketing, document collection/scanning/OCR, legal research, document management (DMS + version control). Everyone communicates almost exclusively via e-mail, and remote work facilities are ubiquitous.<p>To the extent that technology is available that&#x27;s not getting adopted, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not good enough. Predictive coding can be very helpful, but it also has a fixed setup and training overhead that makes it less efficient for smaller matters. That&#x27;s why arguably the biggest shift in discovery in the last 15 years hasn&#x27;t been to automating it, but outsourcing it to contract lawyers.<p>In the area of research, Westlaw and Lexis still rule because of their completeness and accuracy. If I need a copy of some statute enacted in 1873 I can not only find it, but I can get original scans so I can verify the text is free of OCR errors.<p>Moreover, things that are easy on the rest of the web are not easy when it comes to legal (or scientific) research. PageRank, for example, works great when everyone searching for &quot;skiing near Tahoe&quot; is looking for the same popular pages. But when you&#x27;re doing legal research, a lower-court case that directly addresses your issue but isn&#x27;t widely cited is much more valuable than a highly-cited Supreme Court case that doesn&#x27;t address your issue. And computers still don&#x27;t really understand either what issue you&#x27;re looking for or what issue a case is about. So ancient technology (search for this word near that word) still rules the day.<p>> There are good reasons for this, as law firms tend to be cost agonistic (since they pass costs directly to their client)<p>This is oft-stated, but economically fallacious. Price is a function of supply and demand. The client cares about total cost for a particular legal service; she doesn&#x27;t care about how that cost is broken down. If the client&#x27;s budget for a matter is $300,000, every dollar that goes to costs is a dollar that doesn&#x27;t go to the law firm. This is true even if you&#x27;re billing by the hour, because in the long run, a firm will raise rates until hours x rate = client budget.",1418755444

The firm has to leave some data collection up to the investigator, and then have some data turned over. By data, I mean hard drives, images of hard drives, images of network shares, email exchanges, etc.<p>The law firm has to pay for the data collection, the disk space to store the data, the transmission of data back and forth (investigator found something good, buys external HD, ships it via the mail), the data analysis, the investigation and reporting, and then sometimes the expert witness.<p>Sometimes, the law firm does not know what they&#x27;re looking for, in other words, there is no smoking gun piece of data. Sometimes, the goal is to find something, anything, that would hint, point, or prove a goal.<p>What this means is that a retainer can either be here is 10hours worth of analysis/investigation to find the email we know was sent that contains this particular text. They do not plan on the analysis and investigation to exceed that and usually the result is we found it/didn&#x27;t find it and we did it in the time allotted or under the time.<p>It can also be, &quot;we&#x27;re looking for evidence that this type of event has occurred&quot;. This is where the billed-hours start stacking up. Its hard enough digging through other people&#x27;s emails, documents, and pictures looking for something, let alone digging without having something in particular to look for.<p>The point is, I believe that they, the law firms, want to, and need to, bring this in house. This greatly improves the process. But now they need security, real security, because its not their data being stored, it is their client&#x27;s client&#x27;s data and so forth. It becomes very sensitive.<p>They need infrastructure. They need to be able to forensically acquire data. Forensically store data. Forensically analyse data. Forensically share data. The infrastructure needs to be fast, easy, and effecient. We&#x27;re seeing 6TB hard drives now... shares of much, much larger size. And they do not want to be storing their client&#x27;s data in someone else&#x27;s cloud.<p>Then they either need technicians and investigators or the ability to hire and grant access to their data on their network to the tech/investigator. They need technicians to provide solutions to the inevitable problems run into (i.e. how can I acquire each of the 2 drives in this FusionDrive raid and return to the lab and build the raid on something other than osX?) And they need investigators experienced at honing in on relevant data while digging through vast troves of data.",1418755256
8758534,comment,8751946,8757514,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Is there any analysis that supports to this statement?<p>Why are you asking for analysis? Aren&#x27;t the lists of patents in the pools published? You can look directly at the source materials.<p>> Having seen many hundreds of patents, many of them in the video encoding area, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to describe most of them as incremental improvements.<p>Certainly they aren&#x27;t <i>revolutionary</i>, but you&#x27;re ignoring the question of whether they&#x27;re incremental improvements over existing patents or over the public domain. If the question is whether a patent reduces the incentive for others to make incremental improvements, finding an incremental improvement to something that exists in the public domain provides no such evidence.<p>> Also, the likes of Apple, Microsoft and Google end up paying the MPEG-LA much, much more than what they get paid for their share of the patents in the pool. They certainly do not cancel out<p>Do you have some evidence of this? For any company whose percentage of patents in the pool is proportional to their market share in the market, basic arithmetic says the royalties should cancel.<p>> if they had their way, they&#x27;d rather not pay anything at all. Unfortunately, with those codecs enjoying so much popular hardware support, they have little choice but to partake in the pool and pay their dues.<p>These are the companies that make the hardware or who tell the hardware makers what to make. If they collectively wanted to make the patent pool go away they could all just support both for a couple of generations while announcing immediately when support for the old codec will be discontinued so that people can stop using it. For some reason they don&#x27;t.<p>> Anyone willing to contribute innovation to the market has a simple option: invent some technology that is valuable enough to be included in the standard, offer their own patents to the pool and get a share of the licensing pie.<p>But that&#x27;s not how the standards bodies work. Nobody wants NPE patents in the pool but the NPE, and NPEs don&#x27;t get a vote in the standards body. There are two primary ways that NPEs get royalties from the pool. The first is patents that cover the standard but nobody knew that when the standard was finalized or they would have fixed it, the classic submarine patent. You can&#x27;t make money on this except by accident or by dishonesty. The second is patents that are so unreasonably broad they can&#x27;t be avoided no matter what you do even if you know about them ahead of time. These are a defect in the patent office which shouldn&#x27;t have issued them. No part of his involves some nice fellows in lab coats making decent wages without doing anything untoward.<p>> That way, inventors can do what they are good at (inventing) and vendors can do what they are good at (implementing and commercializing). Classic division of labour.<p>Patent pools have nothing to do with division of labor. They&#x27;re an evolved response to patent thickets. Division of labor is: you get a patent and you sell it to a practicing entity who uses it to enjoy a competitive advantage. Patent pools only happen when there are so many patents you can&#x27;t help tripping over them and the industry is trying to make the problem go away as best it can.",1418755243

Probably my favorite part:<p>> Mike Lazaridis was at home on his treadmill and watching television when he first saw the Apple iPhone in early 2007. There were a few things he didn&#x27;t understand about the product. So, that summer, he pried one open to look inside and was shocked. It was like Apple had stuffed a Mac computer into a cellphone, he thought.<p>> To Mr. Lazaridis, a life-long tinkerer who had built an oscilloscope and computer while in high school, the iPhone was a device that broke all the rules. The operating system alone took up 700 megabytes of memory, and the device used two processors. The entire BlackBerry ran on one processor and used 32 MB. Unlike the BlackBerry, the iPhone had a fully Internet-capable browser. That meant it would strain the networks of wireless companies like AT&T Inc., something those carriers hadn&#x27;t previously allowed. RIM by contrast used a rudimentary browser that limited data usage.",1418755113

Take minimum wage for example.  Assume that tomorrow the government revoked the power to control wages.  What happens next?<p>Fast food chains and big box stores would push their wages as low as the market will bear.  Some employees will quit, but a lot will stay because working 80 hours a week and living in abject poverty is still better than literally starving.  There&#x27;s still a minimum wage, it&#x27;s just now being set by corporate entities that don&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t) have any motivations beyond their own company&#x27;s self interest.<p>Or maybe the employees unionize.  They get organized and set terms for as high a wage as they can extract from the employers.  The employee&#x27;s quality of life goes up, but the business owners now have no recourse but to pay the demanded wages or close.  And the new employment contracts start including clauses about mandatory union membership (including dues).  Again, a minimum wage is being set by someone, just not someone who has (or should have) any interest in the larger economic repercussions.<p>The power exists, and it&#x27;s going to be wielded by somebody somewhere.  The government, at least, is ostensibly motivated by the best interests of the populace at large.  That interest is, of course, frustrated as often as its honored in the real world.  Still, I don&#x27;t see how taking power from an institution that only intermittently pursues my best interests and handing it to an institution that never does is in any way an improvement.",1418754996

8758494,comment,8754775,8755654,0,0,sgnelson,,,"Wrong, wrong and wrong.  I&#x27;ll start with the last &quot;wrong&quot; first.  The third wrong (for your statement which only includes two issues) is for the typical, and ill thought process of technology.  That it won&#x27;t change, and it won&#x27;t get better.  It will, and it&#x27;s doing so by leaps and bounds.  3d printers are quite literally coming out with new processes and equipment every single day.  There have been a number of announcements in just the last few months that make it appear that even using metals for at home printing at an affordable rate may be possible in the next five years. There is such a fast rate of change and innovation, it&#x27;s a bit silly to think that your comments on bad quality and materials won&#x27;t change within the next year (if those comments were correct, they&#x27;re not.)<p>As to materials, literally, every month, there are new materials coming out.  At this point, I can use my desktop reprap to print ceramics, PET, Nylon, ABS (to just name a few), and all sorts of hybrids/specific compounds of these plastics designed for 3d printing.  Nylon, PET, ABS are good enough for probably ~90% (very rough guess, sorry) of most of the plastic products in your home, it&#x27;s probably good enough for most of the products I (and many others want to make).<p>As to precision, that&#x27;s also quite wrong.  The printers are quite precise.  They&#x27;re not as precise as the $75,000 CNC Mill that will get me .001&quot; accuracy, but the truth is that most people don&#x27;t even need .01&quot; accuracy.  And my printer cost me $500, quite a large cost premium there in terms of accuracy (ignoring the importance of cutting metal at this time).<p>As to doing CNC at home.  Even a quite crappy homemade CNC mill, built on a real &quot;mill&quot;(something like a g0704) (not the laughable (to me) desktop mills that have come out recently, which are glorified dremels using similar methods of driving the axis&#x27; as a 3d printer, which you can cut aluminum at atrociously slow rates) is going to cost you at least $3000 (machine tools are expensive, not just because of the actual mill, but all the tool holders, bits, cutters, precision vises, calipers, etc. etc. that you also need to make it useful).  So yes, a CNC mill is great for alot of things, but that homemade CNC mill isn&#x27;t really going to hold .001 accuracy either, unless you spend a lot of time working on it and you really know what you&#x27;re doing.<p>I&#x27;m not going to continue on with this argument, but it seems like your view of 3d printers and CNC milling is quite naive.",1418754817

Thank you for letting me know. By trolling the uninformed you seemingly have no meaningful point other than to point your finger and laugh at the views of others. This action runs counter to your stated goal of wanting scientists to be better programmers. What good do you think it will do to the world to troll people using your novice Python skills?<p>You do realize that when someone searches for &quot;Matt Oates&quot;, &quot;bioinformatics&quot; and &quot;Python&quot; they are likely to find this page in the future, and learn about your love of trolling, right?<p>I do not want to live in a troll world, just like I don&#x27;t want to live in a world where people use false and undercutting statements disguised as joviality. Instead, I teach scientists how to be better at the programming they need to do good science.<p>Your last paragraph tells me that you have very little experience in writing parsers. In a record oriented format, and with hand-written parsers, resynchronization to the record boundary is easy. In Perl&#x27;s it&#x27;s almost trivial, because nearly all record-oriented formats have a boundary which can be handled with $/ ; FASTA is an exception but still easy to handle. On the other hand, my point is that it&#x27;s much harder to resynchronize with a context-free grammar.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of a failing case with my strict parser. HAS2_CHICK was the only record in SWISS-PROT 39 with a DT line of:<p><pre><code>    DT   30-MAY-2000 (REL. 39, Created)\n</code></pre>\nThis failed because the spec said that the &quot;REL.&quot; was only supposed to be a &quot;Rel.&quot; My parser failed. Every other parser basically said (by lack of full validation) that they weren&#x27;t interested in that field, and ignored it.<p>You can certainly condemn the entire SWISS-PROT 39 release as &quot;garbage&quot; for having a single record which didn&#x27;t match the spec. Effectively everyone who wants the data will disagree with you. You can also train your parser to ignore those details, and retrain it for every release, though you&#x27;ll find it increasingly difficult to accept the format as it changes across 5 different database releases.<p>Here&#x27;s another example. Some of the GENBANK records included a qualifier of &quot;/primer&quot;, which wasn&#x27;t in the specification. My parsers failed, because it validated the qualifier names. And you know what? No one really cares about that failure, so I had to tweak my parser to allow the non-standard name. The same with EMBL: the ID line is supposed to have the molecule type (one of &quot;DNA|RNA|circular DNA|circular RNA&quot;). In actuality? Record S40706 had a type of &#x27;XXX&#x27;... and so again, my validating parser stopped, when in reality almost no one cares.<p>As these are further examples of simple differences causing a failure within a record, your bringing up &quot;completely arbitrary and unknown problems with a file&quot; suggests to me that you have little real desire to engage in my point, and rather prefer to troll me by diverting the topic. In case I am wrong, please assume that Perl&#x27;s $/ or a similarly simple method is sufficient to determine the record boundary and resynchronize.<p>The underlying issue is that a database format spec changes after almost every release, so a validating parser ends up having to handle a <i>family</i> of formats, not one. Which is much easier for a line-oriented parser to do, since those formats are written with line-oriented hand-written parsers in mind, and usually updated in such a way as to not break those parsers.<p>When you find out that your nice, elegant, validating context-free parser breaks after nearly every release, due to details that are irrelevant to what you care about, then you might conclude that the rest of the world is a bunch of ignorant fools who can&#x27;t program; or reject the idea of a validating parser for this sort of data and switch to a line-oriented one; or provide a recovery mechanism to determine what to do with the records which couldn&#x27;t be parsed, and continue if requested. I do the latter now.<p>(It&#x27;s also difficult to use a CFG-based parser that doesn&#x27;t know about record boundaries to parse files that don&#x27;t fit into memory even though each record does. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s still an issue in bioinformatics these days, but it certainly is in cheminformatics. In any case, a mix of simple record extraction and a CFG-based grammar suffice, excepting for records containing an entire genome, which is outside the scope of this sort of task, and for PIR, which had header and footer components to the file.)<p>Regarding performance, don&#x27;t trust your beliefs or mine. Measure it. Empiricism trumps faith. Try benchmarking a hand-written, line-oriented FASTA parser against your grammar. I wrote one just now in Python. The regex which used &quot;[^>\n].*\n&quot; was about 2% faster than checking the [specific sequence letters]. A 2% here and a 2% there and those validations quickly incur noticeable overhead. By comparison, my line-oriented parser took about 1/2 the time of the regex-based parser.<p>Of course, Perl has a different runtime environment and will have different conclusions.<p>Then again, there&#x27;s already a history in Perl of variable stringency levels for improved performance. Swissknife (doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/15.9.771) was written as a lazy parser because Perl5 wasn&#x27;t fast enough for full validation and parsing of each record. Partial evaluation gave a 4x performance improvement when full validation wasn&#x27;t needed.",1418754779

It restricts what the government is allowed to do.  In the context of the 2nd amendment, it is not allowed to create arms control laws.  It does anyway.  Differences in the de facto exercise of rights between citizens and non-citizens are likely due to different levels of access to the court system and in relative political clout, rather than some underlying intent that is not obvious in the document itself.<p>By plain reading of the law, &quot;the people&quot; means the people.  It includes any humans acting in their own capacity, as themselves, rather than as the agents or representatives of another legally distinct entity.  Begging the pardon of the state, and its judges, but the people do not find it convenient for the state to redefine what personhood means, especially when done in a way that skirts the limits set forth by the people for the government.<p>You have to be a lawyer to think that &quot;the people&quot; does not include <i>any person</i>.  A non-lawyer can apply the common meaning of the word and use it without stopping to argue over whether it means what it means.<p>I don&#x27;t give a fig whether it is about Mexicans or Tenctonese.  If they are people at all, they are people who have the right to keep and bear arms.<p>Besides that, if &quot;the people&quot; were so defined as to include only those people who created the government, I, as someone born more than 200 years later, would certainly not qualify.  If you exclude illegal aliens on that basis, you exclude <i>everyone who did not explicitly ratify the original document</i>, which is to say almost everyone alive today, excluding only those who have sworn an oath of office.  If I am not thus protected by the law, I am not obligated to follow it.  Do we really want to open up that can of worms?  Lysander Spooner&#x27;s &quot;No Treason&quot; essays may elucidate further, but I think perhaps it would be a greater boon to civil order if we agree that &quot;the people&quot; are not necessarily a specific subset of people.",1418754494

8758359,comment,8757865,8758041,0,0,davismwfl,,,"So if your plans vary based on usage patterns and that carries additional charges, then yes, you&#x27;ll have to run some sort of scheduled job to check for users getting close to plan thresholds.  IMO you don&#x27;t want to auto upgrade people, but rather warn them at say 80%, then 90% and give them the option to upgrade or be frozen at their current use level.  This prevents chargebacks and complaints for auto upgrades they didn&#x27;t want to have happen.  Seems you already are on that path.<p>But on the other hand (thinking storage space), if your model is such that they pay $9.99/month with up to 5gb and for every gb over 5 they pay $0.99 say.  Then you can auto charge the incremental fees and just make sure you are sending the clients an email and keeping them in the loop.  I have not done this with Stripe myself so I am not sure the best way to set it up, but my initial guess would say you leave their base plan alone (unless they upgrade/downgrade it) and just add a surcharge to their account at Stripe if they go over their allotted storage space. One way I can think of off the top of my head is to change their account balance to be -$.99, or whatever their overage is, so that Stripe can bill that plus their next monthly service.  But I am sure there is likely a more elegant solution.<p>Someone else mentioned Chargebee, which is a great service, but we chose not to go the route of like a Chargebee because paying additional fees on top of Stripe just didn&#x27;t fit our model initially, and we feel our chargeback risk is very low.  But if you have a higher risk business with a greater potential for chargebacks and disputes then it is best to insulate your self as best you can, and Chargebee helps you do that.  In our case, we actually can process charges through Stripe or Balanced payments (although 100% is going through Stripe right now), which is why we did the vendor based model as I described above, that was our insurance in case we every had problems with one provider.",1418753318

Either way, sarcasm aside, I guess you didn&#x27;t really understand what I was trying to say if you&#x27;re taking my diamond comparison as perfectly analogous, and then shooting down the idea because it doesn&#x27;t extrapolate the same way you expect it to.<p>Up until some point, it was also difficult to manufacture synthetic diamonds at large scale. When the price of the thing desired is right / high enough, technology will be found and whatever costs necessary will become feasible.",1418752885

But, as has been extensively commented upon in the past, that&#x27;s just crazy.  We&#x27;re just barely at the point of doing semi-decent VR (Oculus Rift) and just barely at the point of doing semi-decent wearable heads-up displays (Google Glass).  The idea that Magic Leap could in any foreseeable timeframe create a device that has all the virtues of the Rift + Glass + A huge dose of additional technology on top of both is just laughable.<p>But if they&#x27;re trying for something much heavier-weight, like the ability to create convincing illusions not in the form-factor of &quot;some goggles,&quot; but rather, &quot;a specially prepared room and table,&quot; then that&#x27;s maybe a little more realistic -- and of course less obviously revolutionary.",1418752878

From what I remember with my experiments with stereoscopy this should reduce VR sickness in about 10-20% of the population for which accommodation mismatching with stereopsis causes issues.<p>Note that this effect is why 99% of the content in feature-length 3d movies appears at an apparent distance of more than 10 feet from you; the amount that accommodation falls off rapidly with distance, so it&#x27;s a much less strong effect at that distance.",1418752855
