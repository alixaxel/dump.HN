I think the far more interesting questions are why we do irrational things in the face of clear and overwhelming evidence. For instance, the knowledge of how to become physically fit and wealthy is public knowledge and freely available to anyone with internet access. I know I shouldn&#x27;t eat that giant piece of cake right before I go to bed, but I do anyway, every night. I think the answer is, we are ruled by our chemical makeup, much more than any of us care to admit. The research discussed in &quot;The Power of Habit&quot; is the most interesting as far as ways to overcome our dependence on chemical/hormonal states ruling our lives.",1419778712

The privacy features are kinda moot and not effective, and the hardware is a joke.
Low end SOC(TI DM3730 which is 4-5 years old now) with poor media support and very low performance and only 1GB RAM.
Limited RAM and extremely limited ROM/Onboard FLASH which will limit the OS in the long run or force you to use the SSD card which will lead to probably the most common leakage.
Oh and the screen? 3.5&quot; TFT, 800x480 resistive, seriously where did they even find a resistive touch screen these days at the bargain bin on Alibaba? 
And they expect people to pay 850 EURO&#x27;s for that?
So no this is not a modernization of the N900 it&#x27;s pretty much the N900 with hardware that is only slightly newer than what was available when the N900 came to the market.<p>There is seriously no reason for this phone to be so poorly designed especially with their mentality of sandbox rather than trust.
We had quite a few phone projects that were either designed by the community or by small companies and all of them managed to use top of the line hardware.
You have Snapdragon 800/801 phones under 300$ these days, why use a SOC that will not even be able to play a movie these days?<p>So sadly this isn&#x27;t the driod you should be looking for, still waiting for a Tizen/Meego phone worth while Samsung has been shipping some in India, and Yatta has a very nicely designed phone out in Europe and Russia but none of them are toolkit phones sadly.",1419778251

It says that students who were praised for &quot;being smart&quot; developed this ego/defensiveness problem and subsequently began to underperform. While students praised for working hard did not, and ended up outperforming the &quot;smart&quot; group. The amazing thing about the research, to me, is that this effect was very prominent and quick, and it happened based on only one sentence being told to the students on one occasion. It did not take years of parents telling their child, &quot;you are so smart&quot;. It took one teacher telling the child once, &quot;you did so well, you must have worked hard&quot;, for the effect to take place.<p>[1] <a href=""http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/</a>",1419778115

I’m currently experimenting with a vertical mouse (Anchor), a handheld trackball (IMAGE), a handheld touchpad (Perixx), a vertical keyboard (Kinesis Freestyle2), an ergonomic keyboard (Kinesis Advantage), a sitting/standing desk (IKEA) and a sitting ball. The most effective changes seem to be the vertical keyboard, the remote trackball, the new desk and a couple of streching exercises I started doing. While the Advantage does relieve the pinkies in Emacs, it still feels inferior to the vertical Freestyle2 because the forearms are still in a twisted pose.

The point of Neo900&#x27;s monitoring is to let the user access to information that modem is doing something. Of course if you really want to, you can then setup your software to automatically reboot (or power cycle the modem alone) - but outside of very special use cases, that would be pretty pointless. If you don&#x27;t care, you simply don&#x27;t use that data.<p>>But if anyone thinks that any device they can hack together will give them any level of privacy over organizations like the NSA is living in la-la land...<p>Neo900 won&#x27;t magically protect you from anything - no device will. Instead, it gives you tools which, when used properly, can allow you to fight off some of the mass surveillance techniques. Like encryption, which is pretty much rendered moot in most of modern phones where the modem has direct RAM access.<p>Keep in mind however that when you are an explicit target of some three letter agencies, they can probably employ better and more effective methods against you than sniffing on your mobile phone.<p>tl;dr: Neo900&#x27;s privacy solutions are rather targeted towards Stallman, not Snowden or some intelligence agent from foreign country.",1419776439

It&#x27;s an IaaS deployment / management / update tool which has been used in production for several years.<p>You create two yaml files: a release manifest (describing the software components of your system) and a deployment manifest (describing the computers and networks of your system and how to map components to them).<p>This separation means that a single release manifest can be applied to many different actual deployments. At my day job I deploy a large PaaS release into a single virtual machine. My colleagues deploy exactly the same release into AWS with thousands of machines.<p>Systems defined using BOSH can be deployed to AWS, vSphere, OpenStack or Warden (a containerisation system).<p>For local development, the Warden backend enables &quot;BOSH lite&quot;[2] -- releasing and deploying into a virtual machine that hosts a local cloud of containers.<p>If you want to go the next level up to a proper PaaS, you can try Cloud Foundry[3]. It&#x27;s defined as a BOSH release[4], which is how at my day job my co-workers and I are able to work both locally and at scale on identical software.<p>In Cloud Foundry we distinguish between stateless (apps) and stateful (services) software, and we provide a simple way to connect them. The easiest way to play with it is to log into Pivotal Web Services. IBM Bluemix is the same software and is also open to the public.<p>So for example, with Cloud Foundry, if you want ten copies of your app, you do this:<p><pre><code>    $ cf scale my_app -i 10
</code></pre>
And it&#x27;ll be scaled up to 10 instances.<p>Need more RAM?<p><pre><code>    $ cf scale my_app -m 2G
</code></pre>
Now each node gets 2Gb.<p>And so on.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-lite</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release</a>",1419776136

Are languages like Erlang, J, F#, Rust, Haskell or Nim really used in your companies? Are they worth to learn to find a job?
