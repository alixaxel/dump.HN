Because improving the time you spend on testing is something that is essentially hard to do -- and only a meta-information, anyway.<p>An example: A quality assessment of your code tells you that your methods are too long. This gives you a concrete task to do: You simply split all too-long methods. However, with testing time, this is not so: Increasing the effort spent on testing is something you cannot &quot;just do&quot; without a sensible plan. If you want to increase this metric, you have to start to think what is wrong with your current test strategy (maybe nothing&#x27;s wrong at all), and come up with an action plan of how to do.<p>If you&#x27;re that far in the game already, I think this metric has done what it can do. Plus, you&#x27;ll likely see an increase in the metric. Which is justified.<p>Coming up with (critical) test efforts in the wild is our task now.",1418813680

8761848,comment,8761038,8761447,0,0,tzs,,,"I&#x27;ve been reading Grimm&#x27;s fairy tales, and a few of them (heck, most of them) leave me wondering why the heck people would tell that story. For instance, there&#x27;s one called &quot;The Turnip&quot;.<p>There are two brothers, both soldiers. One is rich, one is poor. The poor one gives up soldiering and becomes a gardner. He grows a huge turnip, and gives it to the King as a gift. The King is impressed, and declares that the gardner shall be poor no more, and gives him gifts, proclaiming that he shall have even more than his brother.<p>The brother then gives the King gifts, expecting to get rewarded by the King and return to being wealthier than his brother. The King is impressed, and gives the brother the most impressive thing the King has--the giant turnip. That pisses the soldier brother off, and he hires murderers to kill the gardner brother.<p>The murderers lure gardner brother out to the woods, and prepare to hang him, but they hear a traveller approaching and panic, and only manage to get the gardner stuffed in a sack that they hang from a tree and then they run off.<p>By the time the traveller arrives on the scene, the gardner brother has managed to make a hole in the sack and get his head out. He hails the traveller, and finds out that the traveller is a student in search of knowledge. The student asks what the gardner is doing in the sack. The gardner tells him it is the Sack of Wisdom, and by hanging in it from a tree, one acquires the secrets of the universe.<p>The student begs to be allowed into the sack, and the gardner agrees to change places. The student rescues him, gets into the sack, and the gardner hoists it up the tree. The gardner then steals the student&#x27;s horse and goes home. (Some versions have the gardner send someone an hour or two later to go cut the student down, some just end with gardner riding off on the horse).<p>WTF?<p>What is the point of this story? I don&#x27;t see a lesson...no bad guys get their comeuppance. The guy that I thought was going to be the good guy (the gardner) ends up stealing from the naive student when it suits him. Is the lesson that it is really every man for himself and so when someone does something bad to you, go ahead and find someone else you can screw over to fix your situation?",1418813528

8761841,comment,8756846,8756846,0,0,tommorris,,,"The article is interesting in terms of the fairly clever science but doesn&#x27;t point out the really amazing success of the PrEP trials. A variety of PrEP trials have been taking place including the use of oral emtricitabine/tenofovir (Truvada) tablets in a Western context (the PROUD and iPrEx trials) and the CAPRISA 004 pericotal tenofovir gel trial in South Africa.<p>The basic idea is this: using antiretrovirals as a preventative strategy. Take one of the current combination HIV antiretrovirals (emtricitabine/tenofovir, for instance) and administer it to patients who are at risk of getting HIV (drug users, men who frequently have sex with men without condoms, people with HIV positive partners).<p>The trials have been really successful. Adherence has been high. Side effects have been low and controllable. Those on PrEP combined with a frequent testing regime don&#x27;t show signs of increased risk behaviour.<p>Because of the success of the trials, the WHO and the CDC are now recommending that people in high-risk groups start taking a daily PrEP - and in the US, plenty of doctors are now prescribing it for some of their high-risk patients.<p>Here&#x27;s where it gets more interesting: the patents on Truvada, the emtricitabine/tenofovir combo tablet, expire in 2016. Currently Truvada as PrEP is an expensive proposition: in the US costing between $8,000 and $14,000 according to government figures. Low-income users of PrEP can get financial subsidy from Gilead Sciences, the manufacturer of Truvada—Gilead don&#x27;t consider Truvada as PrEP to be a major financial gain for them so they are providing subsidies in the US for PR reasons.<p>Countries with national healthcare systems are probably going to try and hold off for long enough for Truvada as PrEP to go out of patent and then wait for generics to come on the market.<p>That&#x27;s when things get interesting. Currently, $8-$14k for a preventative is too much even for rich countries to consider. It wouldn&#x27;t pass the United Kingdom&#x27;s NICE process on cost-benefit grounds. But imagine if it cost a few hundred dollars a year rather than a few thousand. Then the cost-benefit analysis becomes a lot easier. In the UK, we currently pay around £300,000 to treat an HIV positive patient over the course of their lifetime. A few hundred dollars a year for those most at risk as a preventative cuts a lot of healthcare costs.<p>Imagine the scenario: in the West, anyone who wants to get on PrEP would be able to do so with minimal fuss—it&#x27;d be cheap enough that reasonably well-off people could pay out of pocket, and it&#x27;d be covered by insurance and national health coverage. It becomes as routine for the younger gay male population as the contraceptive pill became with women. This provides the sexually responsible a second line of defence, and the less sexually responsible a pretty effective (90%+, if the iPrEx study is to be believed) first line of defence. It&#x27;s backed up by a routine testing and education regimen that catches infections early to prevent spread. The challenge is how to roll it out cheaply in Africa: finding a way to do bulk production of the drugs and ensure they are being taken responsibly. The hard bit there isn&#x27;t making the pills but building the public health infrastructure. Still cheaper than the economic costs of mass HIV infection though.<p>PrEP isn&#x27;t a vaccine but it might end up functioning like one: reducing the transmission rate in affected communities over the long run means less people needing treatment and decreasing the overall risk of infection. And come 2016, once the patents are gone, it&#x27;ll be cheap. There&#x27;s lots of people wringing their hands about PrEP mostly for dumb moralistic reasons but it looks like the first major innovation in HIV that might actually have a shot at working.",1418813219

8761824,comment,8761539,8761635,0,0,exDM69,,,"> This stuff was all well understood four decades ago. Much of it was forgotten outside the mainframe world, because threads and multiprocessors didn&#x27;t make it to microprocessors for several more decades.<p>Here&#x27;s an important distinction to make: this stuff was well understood <i>in theory</i>, but the practice is a bit different.<p>Semaphores are a neat theoretical concept but not a very good practical parallel programming paradigm. Semaphores are easy to reason about when writing proofs by induction that a parallel programming algorithm is working correctly, which is why they are still at the core of parallel programming education.<p>But when writing practical multithreaded programs, mutexes and condition variables are a lot more practical. Typically each mutex is coupled with one or more condition variables to wait/signal for conditions such as &quot;queue not full&quot; and &quot;queue not empty&quot;. Incrementing and decrementing numeric counters is a very clumsy way to maintain a state of any kind. Implementing a semaphore requires grabbing a spinlock and doing this several times is unnecessary when you could just grab one mutex, check for the appropriate condition(s) and then wait/signal on the correct condition.<p>It is rather unfortunate that parallel programming is still primarily being taught in the theoretical manner (at least I was) using primarily semaphores, leaving too little emphasis on the practical implementation. It is important to understand the theory and know how to do the proofs but it is equally important to apply this into practice.<p>Every time I see someone &quot;implement&quot; a semaphore using a pthread mutex and condition variable, I cry a little. I&#x27;ve seen this several times in production code.<p>> It&#x27;s very simple. That&#x27;s the real use case for P and V. Linus&#x27; note indicates that in 1999 he didn&#x27;t know this.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Linus was joking and he did understand what semaphores are used for. Every computer science curriculum has a course on parallel programming with bounded buffer producer consumer/problems, readers/writers problems and other &quot;toy problems&quot; solved using semaphores, followed by proof by induction that the solution is correct. And Linus did, eventually, finish a degree on computer science.",1418812625

When you squint at how the field operations work in this representation, you&#x27;ll find that you end up doing something that looks very similar to the 2x2 matrix multiplications trick; with a bit of rearrangement, it&#x27;s the same thing - except that the matrix multiplication trick is usually derived via dynamic programming, and Binet&#x27;s formula is usually derived via power series.<p>The fact that things often fit together so nicely is perhaps the most beautiful aspect of mathematics.",1418810730
