I&#x27;ve been wanting to get into 8-bit computing and do a &quot;ground up&quot; build of something using an 8088, Z80, or something of that ilk for a while.<p>Since we&#x27;re on the subject... can anybody recommend any good books / websites / magazine articles / etc., that cover this kind of ground? That is, starting from a raw chip (a simple one, like one of these old 8 bit ones, not a 80386 or something) and building a simple computer from scratch?

This is where they have all public transport go to a central hub, rather than organising around transport demands and having direct buses from residential to industrial areas or cross country trains.<p>So you always have to go into a hub (city center in Nottingham, London in England), and then walk & wait around for a new bus/train (or tube from station to station in London).<p>This significantly increases journey times to anywhere that&#x27;s not the hub. Also the assholes charge £20 more for having the gall to go through London, even though that&#x27;s precisely how they set the system up. So now to get to my home town I either have to get 4 trains outside of London, or 2 and a tube through London.<p>It&#x27;s more economical and profitable for the bus/train companies, but costs everyone not going to the central hub a lot of time.",1419422281

As was the norm for that show, in every episode Kirk somehow managed to find an alien planet with a beautiful woman on it that needed some sort of help. [insert long discussion about misogyny in 1960s TV shows]. I&#x27;m a bit of a movie buff, so I started using IMDB to look up some of these actresses to see what they&#x27;re doing now.<p>Dang. They&#x27;re either dead or in their 80s.<p>We are becoming the first generation to have a multi-media reminder of how short life is. In previous generations once grandpa died, you might have a painting and/or some family stories to share. Perhaps a tombstone to visit. Over time the memory faded away. In this generation and future ones, when grandpa dies? Hell, he might still be online, a bot posting his musings for the next 50 years. I don&#x27;t see a reason grandpa can&#x27;t send the grandkids a &quot;Happy Birthday! Now you&#x27;re 60!&quot; message decades after he passes.<p>This is a good thing overall, in my mind, but this constant reminder of how short life is has the effect of making people really stingy about their time. That&#x27;s probably not such a good thing, as many important connections happen when we&#x27;re not looking for them.<p>As I get older, I find the need to <i>orchestrate</i> my time instead of conserving it: spending some time on high-energy, deeply-focused tasks and spending some time purposefully _not_ focusing and instead spending time socially with others I care about. Working in a good technology team is good for the former, exercise, outdoors, and family is good for the latter, at least for me.<p>Being mindful of time is fine. Being stingy with it or bitter about losing it? Not so much.",1419422141

Require.JS doesn&#x27;t play nicely either. I wish Javascript come out with built module system but it feels like you&#x27;re just dressing up a pig now.<p>Maybe people do like coding in Javascript but so far the direction that Javascript is going feels like a mess and added complication.

8792516,comment,8791260,8792103,0,0,ANTSANTS,,,"Probably because Flash isn&#x27;t as relevant as it used to be. Years ago poor Flash support was a dealbreaker for a lot of people that might have switched to Linux, which provided a strong raison d&#x27;être for open source Flash replacements. Nowadays, due to popular platforms like iOS with no Flash support, few sites <i>rely</i> on Flash for core functionality (though you still have cases like video quality being better for Youtube on Firefox with Flash because of the licensing issues with H264, most regular users won&#x27;t notice this). &quot;Millennials&quot; (or whatever the fuck people in their 20s now are supposed to be called) that want to keep Homestar Runner alive are probably the biggest group that cares about having an open source Flash runtime today.<p>I still like Flash. It helped a lot of kids (myself included) get into computers, its authorship tools allowed non-programmers to create a lot of really cool animations and interactive things over the years, and technically it&#x27;s <i>still</i> ahead of HTML5 in a lot of ways (the gap is slowly shrinking due to Adobe&#x27;s stupefying negligence and apathy for the platform, but I still find that most websites with even the slightest hint of superfluous animation lurch and stutter embarrassingly today on my fairly decked-out PC compared to full-blown Flash animations on my Pentium). If Adobe hadn&#x27;t bought Macromedia, and if their management had had the good sense to release the source to the Flash player client, I think the web would be in a much better place right now.",1419422005

I stumbled with workflow problems in 2004, wrote simple django-fsm library in 2010, and decide that I could do more in 2013 with django-viewflow.<p>Common web frameworks like django or flask solves only technical problem related to HTTP/Client/Server functionality and nothing related to business logic organization except simple CRUD support.<p>It works pretty well if you going to create data entry applications for your business. Data entry applications allows end users to enter the data and do some queries and reporting.  Basically you are offer for end user a set of forms for data entry, grid for end user queries and set of reports for things that couldn’t be achieved with simple grid filtering.<p>The usage pattern for worker is to enter the data, run the query/report and decide what to do next. This style of applications allows unlimited ways for interaction for end users, and adopts many scenarios.<p>But very fast it became not enough. The breakpoint happens when you came with idea, that you need something like `STATE` or `STATUS` field for one of you entity. This probably happens when you try to organize workers pipeline and collaboration.<p>And this ruins your well designed CRUD application. Mix of hidden state changes and crazy querying randomly scattered over the code makes hard to have a whole picture what really happens.\nAfter a half of the year, team of 5 developers could produce working but cluttered application that really hard to change to adopt new business process requirements.<p>The core problem that common web MVC pattern have nothing related to people collaboration.  Fortunately there was a lot of research in this field, starting from 198x.<p>And the answer is - we need an explicit workflow layer (yeah, so pythonic)<p>You can take a look to <a href=""http://www.workflowpatterns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.workflowpatterns.com/</a>  It’s pretty formal and hard to read, but it contains set of common patterns that happens when you trying to describe people workflow.<p>From historic point of view, there was discussion - what is the best way to represent people collaboration visually, what building blocks should be used and etc. In the 2004 there was several popular approaches for this like ebXML, BPEL, and many other formats.<p>At the 2014 we have the answer - only BPMN products became successful with the time. I think you will not very surprised with this fact, if you will know that BPMN is the only format designed for understanding by humans first. Other formats was designed like bad visual programming language and they are failed.<p>The core difference of BPMN that you have a gate nodes explicitly separated out of task nodes. This give you unlimited amount of flexibility, and most systems allows to skilled programmer develop very custom gate logic to accommodate all process requirements, embedded into reusable flow building block.<p>And the last part. The rise of workflow systems happens in the 200x. There was the time when UI-only  programs declared as the way to happy user experience. Missing UI tools for system administration was declared as main problem of Linux operation system. Nowadays, UI for administration mostly failed. Today is the rise of script languages like Chef, Salt, Puppet, and DevOps as profession for system administration.<p>This sort of things became happens even with existing workflow tools, like jPBM based <a href=""http://camunda.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://camunda.org/</a><p>I believe that should happens with any existing workflow software. With good designed library or language for workflow specification, developing application would be faster than any ui programming.<p>So, as the result of thoughts described above, Viewflow is the library that offers an additional layer for django web framework allows explicitly specify people workflow and takes out the workflow logic from django views.<p>You can take a look for shipment views example, when I start i didn’t expect that so complex workflow could be exality extracted out of the views  - <a href=""https://github.com/viewflow/viewflow/blob/master/tests/examples/shipment/views.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/viewflow/viewflow/blob/master/tests/examp...</a><p>The future of workflow looks like we will have not only well specified business process but mix of process and cases to accommodate best things from data entry and workflow application styles. There is even existing standard for this - CMMN. And it looks like it would be very soon implemented in many workflow tools.",1419420845

There are too many other variables that can explain most poor people being poor; by far, the single best indicator of whether a person will be poor is whether their parents were poor. Many other indicators, education, health, nutrition in childhood, abuse, addictions, etc. follow from the first.<p>So, I find it hard to swallow your premise that greed makes one wealthy and generosity makes one poor. Certainly there are extremes, and it&#x27;s entirely possible to give away the entirety of ones wealth and become poor, but I don&#x27;t know of many examples of that (I&#x27;ve read about some cult members who have given away all of their money to the cult, but not a lot of other examples) or any research indicating it is common.<p>There was recently an article about meritocracy, which had the same basic takeaway I get from this video: That rich people assume they got there by merit and that they deserve everything they have. And, it discussed the tendency among those at the top to exhibit little desire to help others up, or any sense that they might be ethically obligated to do so.<p>I went through an Ayn Rand phase when I was a kid, so I can kinda see where this mentality comes from.

It&#x27;s simply that the standard behavior and thinking of the NK regime is too bizarre to be believable by Western sensibilities, that we dismiss it out of hand.<p>To start with, film is something of a national treasure in NK.  Official documents show KJI as being connected with the production of over 11,000 films.  That is almost certainly an exaggeration, but enough of his stuff has leaked that you can take a class on it at a film school, so it&#x27;s not a &#x27;whole-cloth&#x27; invention.  NK has taken bizarre steps to secure its film heritage, including organized abduction of actors and directors from foreign countries to bolster the regime&#x27;s cast list.<p>Meanwhile, the personality cult is strong, in a way not seen even under Stalin.  For example, the whole country stopped and celebrated [0] because a random citizen put out a fire near a portrait of one of the leaders.  You&#x27;ll find Western media outlets speculating that of course what <i>really</i> happened is she thwarted an assassination attempt, because the truth is absurd to Western sensibilities.<p>These two things combine to form a powerful motive.   The last time a film depicted a NK leader, they made serious efforts to have it banned in their allied countries, although they were not at all successful.  Meanwhile, successfully hacking a US company is of major propaganda value for the regime.  The two targets that they have &quot;hacked&quot;--SK and US--are the ones they complain most loudly about internationally.  So launching some kind of attack would be very consistent with their political rhetoric.<p>Since that time, they&#x27;ve developed a much more sophisticated hacking ring.  There was a time when they relaxed some of the normal rules so that you could outsource your software projects to NK software developers, and, from what I understand, some large companies did.  That was one of the ways they built skills.  While they&#x27;re pretty incompetent by nation-state standards, they seem to have improved a lot in recent years, and of course they&#x27;re better-funded and better-organized than any common criminal hacking ring.  It would be completely within NK&#x27;s wheelhouse to devote 10% of GDP to this project even while their people starve.<p>Meanwhile, of course, Sony has a very poor track record on security--between the rootkits, GeoHot, Linux, etc., I don&#x27;t know a lot of qualified security researchers who would feel good about working there.  This has created a bit of a security vacuum and of course they <i>have</i> been hit by common criminals, several times in the last few years.  So it&#x27;s very believable that hitting them is within NK&#x27;s reach.<p>Finally, as far as nation-states having an extortion motive again that is very much within NK&#x27;s wheelhouse.  They are a poor country and they are engaged in all kinds of bizarre plots to raise money.  Notably, they built up a counterfeiting ring for US currency so sophisticated that we ended up redesigning the bills [1].  NK also runs sort of an industrialized Breaking Bad operation, to the extent that a lot of the country is hooked on their own product [2].  Their MO at this point is very definitely to take common criminal operations and scale them up under the cloak of a nation-state to drive revenue.  It&#x27;s not a leap to electronic extortion.  They&#x27;re basically a super-mafia at this point, and this is a new department.<p>As far as their being no &quot;DNA, smoking-gun&quot; evidence--that&#x27;s true.  But I think the circumstantial identifying evidence, combined with motive, means, and opportunity, is pretty compelling.  The communications from GOP are as bizarre and convoluted as anything the NK regime says, and not what you&#x27;d expect from a simple criminal enterprise.  If it&#x27;s not NK, it remains to be explained why the hackers went to some lengths to fool <i>real</i> security analysts at an actually <i>first-class</i> nation-state, but did so in such a bizarre and haphazard way as to target an especially weak US company that does not demonstrate any particular skill beyond what others have done before.  That level of convolution demands a geopolitical explanation of some type that goes beyond simple extortion, but it&#x27;s much more elaborate to explain who would want the US angrier at NK than we already are, and how these shadowy figures would benefit.<p>Finally, as far as the &quot;inside job&quot; theory--it is <i>completely</i> believable to me that NK would be willing to throw a few tens of thousands of dollars in bribes to get inside.  They spent much more than that celebrating putting out the poster-fire.  So that idea that Sony had angry employees to me actually strengthens the case for an NK-based theory, as it provides a simple and cheap way for them to get inside.<p>[0] <a href=""http://newfocusintl.com/exclusive-why-north-korea-handed-a-bravery-award-to-ri-kyong-sim/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newfocusintl.com/exclusive-why-north-korea-handed-a-b...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdollar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superdollar</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.vice.com/read/north-korea-crystal-meth-drugs-diplomats-nathan-thompson"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vice.com/read/north-korea-crystal-meth-drugs-dipl...</a>",1419419875

The mantra (which has become the norm in transportation research, to a lesser degree in professional transportation planning circles and only to a small degree in policy circles) is &#x27;we don&#x27;t need better mobility, we need better accessibility&#x27;.<p>To make this more concrete, you don&#x27;t need better roads, you need better jobs close to your home. But you&#x27;ll only get these once this becomes the common sentiment and people start voting with their feet. Because what you&#x27;re doing now (take better job in exchange for worse commute) only makes the overall situation worse - more people competing for jobs in central locations, and/or people trading bigger houses further away for a longer commute.<p>A lot of work is being started (in Europe, I know little details of efforts elsewhere but from the current literature it seems this is a global trend) on getting people to change their sentiments on transport and home/work location.

I don&#x27;t think the issue is deletionism, it&#x27;s instead one of a total lack of respect for other editors.<p>Regrettably, I probably inadvertently helped with this culture as I <i>also</i> started the Administrators&#x27; notice board. Never have I seen such a cesspool of controversy, beaurocracy, wiki-lawyering and frankly power hungry people. I suffer from bouts of depression, so have left and returned a few times (actually I was made admin three times), but the last time (and believe me, the <i>very</i> last time) I tried to contribute I noticed the complete and utter lack of civility in the place. In a naive attempt to address this I tried to propose a policy where civility would be encouraged and incivility would be discouraged.<p>One of the key opponents, a user called Giano, went on the attack and I left the site - especially after I was told via email from Brad Fitzpatrick that I was unwelcome on Wikipedia.<p>I thought to myself: &quot;I spent 2 years researching and writing about the USA PATRIOT Act for this?!?&quot; [1]<p>And I left and never came back.<p>But, hey, if you want to see the discouragement that an average user sees - checkout my old user page. Even though it is a user page that very clearly says I have &quot;retired&quot; (more like sacked) there is wall to wall templates telling me I have committed a copyright violation (like hell!), or that images or articles will be deleted, etc. [2]<p>Further to this: deletionism is a massive problem. If you don&#x27;t believe me, look at the GNAA article - there were 17 different attempts to delete it! [3] Of course, Jimbo Wales supported the deletion for fairly spurious reasons in 2006.

Popular? What in god&#x27;s name are you talking about? Sexism is as real and as scientifically proven as gravity. It doesn&#x27;t make women victim, but marginalized. That is a fact regardless whether or not you think it&#x27;s in vogue.<p>> That is not in the definition<p>Well, it immediately follows from it. The most basic building bricks of <i>our own</i> culture are almost always invisible from us as our internal organs are. We can easily see how <i>other</i> cultures work, but not our own.<p>> I&#x27;ve had that pushed on my many times.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to you don&#x27;t have to. Just as you don&#x27;t need to learn about the French Revolution or Newton&#x27;s Laws. You can choose to learn about whatever parts of our world you want to. But if you don&#x27;t, don&#x27;t argue out of ignorance.<p>>  and you have to take it on faith that they exist.<p>No. Just tons, and tons and tons and tons and tons of research. No more than you need to &quot;take it on faith&quot; that the French Revolution actually happened.<p>> What are you supposed to do when a woman tells you about her lived experiences again?<p>I don&#x27;t understand. If no one in your family has never been murdered, does that mean murder isn&#x27;t a problem? Are we supposed to discard vast amounts of research -- from psychology, sociology and anthropology based on particular anecdotes?<p>> Yes, please save me from the imaginary boogeymen.<p>Not imaginary and not a boogyman. I just don&#x27;t understand your argument -- if you don&#x27;t directly feel, say, economic forces, are they imaginary? (Well, it&#x27;s theoretically possible that the moment you close your eyes the world ceases to exist, or that we all live in your imagination, but I think that&#x27;s not your working assumption.)<p>> I need a big strong man to rescue me and assuage his misplaced guilt.<p>I see that you, too, confuse sexism with misogyny. Well, misogynists hardly ever feel guilt. Sexists don&#x27;t need to because they&#x27;re not to blame (most women are probably as sexist as men). Sexism is a description of society as it came to be. There is no necessary conspiracy or ill-intent for sexism to blame, just as gravity is not &quot;guilty&quot; of killing people falling off of buildings. It&#x27;s just there, and it&#x27;s just as real. Unlike gravity, though, sexism (and racism) can be fought. I don&#x27;t need to rescue <i>you</i>. I don&#x27;t even know you. I think that society is going to be more interesting and more fun and a lot richer if all groups were able to participate in those places where power resides.",1419418906

I think &quot;scripting vs compiled&quot; is an overly simplistic view. Go compares better against the byte-code AOT compiled languages such as C# and Java.
