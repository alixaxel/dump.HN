It would be great to see an up-front document about portability promises.<p>Is it possible to use other languages to drive the rendering via a linked API?  Thrust [2] did a good start on defining an API for using the UI components from multiple languages, but it still relies on TCP sockets -- as far as I can tell, there&#x27;s no way to make my application load assets from &quot;bundle://&quot; and redirect that to custom handler code while forbidding other network access, and the use of a local TCP socket to communicate between the UI and the main application means there&#x27;s also major reason to be concerned about CSRF attacks on localhost.  We should be able to build desktop UIs without these problems.  Is atom-shell pushing forward on any of these issues, and if so is there any documentation on how?<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/The-solution-of-lacking-libudev.so.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/The-solution-o...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/breach/thrust"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/breach/thrust</a>",1419458286

8794670,comment,8794536,8794536,0,0,jwmerrill,,,"The first place I got the impression that it was a good idea to cache the array length and/or reverse loops was in Zakas, &quot;High Performance Javascript&quot; [1]. The book was written in 2010, and I have a feeling that compiler advances have laid waste to huge swaths of it. Some of it may have already been outdated when it was written. Even so, performance folklore is slow to disappear.<p>I&#x27;ve found everything that Egorov (author of this post) has written is well worth reading.<p>If there&#x27;s one overall theme of his work, it&#x27;s that it is generally highly unreliable to extrapolate the result of micro-benchmarks to real code. Instead, you need to measure potential optimizations in your actual code base. And you might need to do it again next year, because compilers are constantly changing and usually improving.<p>If there&#x27;s a second overall theme, it&#x27;s that you can and should examine the code that your JS compiler is producing, rather than relying completely on black box benchmarks. It would be great if browser dev tools would make this easier to do directly. Currently, I find the external tools for doing this hard enough to set up and manage that it isn&#x27;t really very economical to do this kind of analysis frequently.<p>Compare to Julia, where you can call code_llvm(fn, (argtypes...)) to see the LLVM IR of a piece of code right from the REPL, or code_native(fn, (argtypes...)) to see the generated machine code for your architecture.<p>[1] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=ED6ph4WEIoQC&lpg=PA64&vq=there%20are%20several%20operations%20happening%20each%20time&pg=PA64#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=ED6ph4WEIoQC&lpg=PA64&vq=th...</a>",1419458208

There is the claim that woody shrubs encroaching on grassland reduces the utility of the grassland - whether that&#x27;s in a natural state or as part of a ranch. The buffalo grass prairie was pretty dern eco-rich and cattle grazing isn&#x27;t that far off of that if you&#x27;re careful.<p>It depends on the base ecosystem before you add cattle. If you can graze beef critters in East Texas, Oklahoma or Kansas, I doubt it would have the same effect as doing same where old-growth forest stood in the Amazon basin. These areas <i>generally</i> have adequate rainfall and don&#x27;t require aquifer depletion. Then again, there&#x27;s 2011.<p>The Niman Ranch is in California; I am not sure how that works. Agriculture in general in California requires much redirection of water to work. It could be that cattle ranching is better than Central Valley style crop farming.<p>The critical figure of the piece is the disconnect between 2,500 gallons of water per pound of beef vs. the claim of 441 gallons - again, in California, water is key. The 2,500 figure is suspicious; the 441 gallon figure is at least defended by UC Davis scientists, where the provenance for the 2,500 gallon figure is much more shadowy.",1419457915

The only time the film felt truly deep and expansive to me was when Bilbo first stepped into Erebor and you got to see how massive the pile of gold was as it panned through the main chamber. Then it got closed up and tight again shortly thereafter. The few wider shots that followed reeked of bad CGI compositing (especially when Bilbo falls off the platform with the lever when Smaug knocks it down)<p>I chalked it up to the cinematography just not meshing well with the way the film was shot.",1419455415
