8686160,comment,8680177,8680177,0,0,nocman,,,"A cousin of mine recently lost her life in a very short battle with cancer.  She\nwas only 41 years old -- both of her parents still living.  In the past few years\nthere have been a lot of deaths among my family and friends.  Some of them were very\nold, some very young, and some in-between.<p>I would like to encourage readers here to consider this.  Your life here is \ntemporary.  Even if you are very healthy your whole life, one day you will take\nyour last breath, and it will be over.<p>It is easy to get wrapped up in everyday life.  Pursuing your goals and dreams, or\nperhaps just barely getting by, living day to day.  I think most people tend to push off\nthinking about their own mortality.<p>And as it is, most of us have no idea how much longer we have.  We could be here 50 or 60 more \nyears, or we could die tomorrow in some sort of accident.<p>So the question I would like to pose is this:<p>Are you prepared for your own death?<p>Do you have any idea what will happen to you when you die?  It is going to happen. Isn&#x27;t it worth\nconsidering what the possibilities are, and spending at least some time exploring the question?<p>I believe I have shared this before here (at least to some extent).  I am a Christian, and I believe the Bible is direct revelation from God.  I believe there is life after death, and that the only hope for a peaceful existence after death is found by believing in Jesus Christ in this life.  I would like to encourage anyone here to read for themselves about Jesus&#x27; life on Earth, and make their own decision as to whether they should believe in Him.  I think the best place for you to start reading about Him is in the Bible, in the gospel of John ( <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&search=John%201"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?version=NKJV&search=Jo...</a> ).  That book will give you enough information, IMHO, to make an informed decision about Him.",1417507012

Houses don&#x27;t get bolted sideways onto scyscrapers 5 years after they&#x27;re built, or suddenly need to accommodate multiple order of magnitude more people than they were originally built to hold.  These are regular occurrences in the software world.<p>You are right that most people that come out of university are woefully unprepared to design software systems.  However, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that what ends up being the &quot;best&quot; design in the end is rarely apparent (or appropriate) in the initial planning stages of a software project.  Requirements change, and the architecture needs to adapt with them.  These architectural changes do have a very real cost.  The tough sell is trying to show management that the alternative creates technical debt that will strangle the project if it isn&#x27;t addressed, and that the longer the refactoring is deferred, the more expensive it will be.",1417506813

The right question is: does it stimulate the economy?<p>Currently, people do not spend, and accumulate as much as they can, because they are being told there is a crisis (not for the richest). In Western Europe, governments generally agree to make &quot;reforms&quot; destroying all social advantages inherited from the reconstruction after WWII. In France in particular, the biggest investor if the &quot;local communities&quot; (cities, departments, regions), but the national governement now lowers the money affected to them, leading to less investment from these public investors, killing a lot of jobs.<p>So we don&#x27;t care where money would come from. What we need is somethin that gives people confidence in their future, like a stable job. If you have a job but feel threatned in it every day because your boss can replace you with the &quot;reserve army of labour&quot;, you tend to let your social advantages go away, and earn less. Collectively, this profits to the richest who drain huge parts of the economy to use it in bubble speculations - which also profits them even when the bubble explodes.<p>Besides, we had to transit in a few decades from a social model where women did not work to a model where women now are an active force. Couple that with huge productivity improvements... and we don&#x27;t <i>need</i> a full time job for everyone, for everyone to live correctly.<p>So where does the money come from ?

That means that when you see two numbers that are close together you can think of them as (a+b) and (a-b) where b is small, and a is their average.<p>The challenge is to see this in all its variations.  We can see that 53^2 - 3^2 = (53-3)(53+3), hence 53^2 = 50x56 + 9 which in turn is 100x28 + 9 which is 2809.  So 53^2 is 2809, something I needed a short time ago.
