Compute w = w + D<p>w%7 gives the day of the week, with Saturday being day 0. A couple notes.<p>1. You can reduce mod 7 as you go. For example, to get the day of the week of 1969-07-16, you could think &quot;[69/12] = 5, add 9 (69%12) giving 14 == 0 mod 7. [9/4] = 2, so we are at 2. Add month_offset(7) == 0, giving 0. Add 16 (D), and we have 3 mod 7, so Wednesday&quot;.<p>2. Month_offset is easy to remember if you think of it this way:<p><pre><code>   1 4 4

   0 2 5

   0 3 6

   1 4 6
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s 12^2, 5^2, 6^2, and 12^2+2. I don&#x27;t know why that makes it easy, but Gardner suggested it, and I have not forgotten it in something like 40 years, even though I rarely use it.<p>3. If the year is a leap year, subtract 1 for dates in January and February.<p>4. For years in 2000-2099, subtract 1 from the result. For years in 1800-1899, add 2. If you forget what the century correction is, you can work it out in your head. For instance, to find the correction for 20xx, work out the day of week of 1999-12-31: 99=12x8+3, [3/4]=0, month_offset(12)=6, so 8+3+0+6+31==6 mod 7, or Friday. Now work out 2000-01-01 without a century correction: 0=0x12+0, [0/4]=0, month_offset(1)=1. 2000 is a leap year, so need to subtract 1 in January, so we have 0+0+0+0+1-1+1==1 mod 7, so Sunday. However, it should be Saturday since it comes after Friday, and so the century correction must be -1 for 20xx.<p>5. Gardner&#x27;s method is really one of the other well known methods (I forget which one) adjusted to make mental calculation easier.<p>Addendum: this is described in chapter 7, &quot;Tricks of Lightning Calculators&quot; from the Martin Gardner collection &quot;Mathematical Carnival&quot;.",1417832685

I want to break down Docker into the most discrete and composable parts possible. But I want to do that without hurting the user experience. If you can point out a way to do that, I will implement it. And if you are available to help, it will happen faster.<p>> <i>is there a way to easily find out containers&#x27; names and links, and exact forwarded ports, from the API without regexping `docker ps` output and &quot;tcp/1234&quot;-like strings that should be meant for human eyes only?</i><p>You are not expected to parse &#x27;docker ps&#x27; output programatically. That is not and has never been the recommended way to interact with Docker programatically.<p>Yes, the current API expects clients to parse strings like tcp/1234. A string of the form [PROTO/]PORT seemed like a pretty reasonable thing to parse. But if you would prefer a json object like {&quot;proto&quot;:&quot;tcp&quot;, &quot;port&quot;:1234}, I don&#x27;t have a fundamental problem with that. Feel free to open a github issue to suggest it. In general we frown upon randomly breaking things but if it improves the situation for clients we will consider it. It could also make for a nice first patch if you&#x27;re interested in that :)<p>> * Is it still Docker&#x27;s official position that CLI is only official interface, and using HTTP API is frowned upon?*<p>That was never true. I&#x27;m not sure how you got that idea. The HTTP API has existed forever, the official client uses it for 100% of its functionality, and I definitely recommend using that as the primary mode of interaction with Docker. I acknowledge that the API itself is not perfect, and will welcome any suggestions for improving it (we are discussing quite a few improvements already on #docker-dev).<p>> <i>Since Docker and registry API is HTTP, why can&#x27;t I use http auth (even implemented by an nignx proxy) instead of certs (which are fairly new) or centralized index for authentication?</i><p>You can use all these things with the registry API. The centralized index is completely optional for authentication.<p>I&#x27;m curious where you got all these incorrect notions? If you read it somewhere in the docs, then it&#x27;s a documentation bug and I would appreciate it if you could point it out so we can fix it.<p>> <i>It should be as simple as using `<a href=""https://user:pass@IP/…`"" rel=""nofollow"">https://user:pass@IP/…`</a> URLs, what&#x27;s the problem with it?</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand that part. I believe Docker registry auth today uses basic auth over TLS by default, which has security issues (ie storing your password in clear in your home directory). We are working to add a more secure token-based auth. But you should always be able to use basic auth if you prefer that.<p>> <i>While we&#x27;re at it, why on Earth is HTTP Docker endpoint specified as `tcp://IP:PORT` rather than `<a href=""https://IP:PORT`"" rel=""nofollow"">https://IP:PORT`</a>, which would make it possible and easy to proxy, use http auth in an intuitive way, and generally reflect how it works rather than obscure it?</i><p>I don&#x27;t understand your question here either. Are you saying you would like the format of the command-line option <i>docker -H</i> to start with <i><a href=""https://*"" rel=""nofollow"">https://*</a> instead of </i>tcp://<i>? If so, I think that&#x27;s a good idea, but it also seems like a ridiculously small and cosmetic problem. I also don&#x27;t understand how it affects http proxying or auth in any way. Regardless of the command-line flag, the API </i>actually uses https*. So auth and proxying should work completely as expected (with the exception of `attach` which drops to the raw TCP socket to allow bi-directional streams. But we have a websockets endpoint for that and I would really like to deprecate the &quot;drop to tcp&quot; mode soon.",1417832377

Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if we could enforce in our code that `w` and `h` have the same units?  Or that the result of `Area` has squared units compared to the result of `Perimiter`?<p>You can do exactly that, by defining extensions like so:<p><pre><code>    module UnitExtensions =

Now units are enforced by the type system:<p><pre><code>    open UnitExtensions

    RectLib.Perimiter(1<m>, 2<ft>)   // error - <m> doesn&#x27;t match <ft>
    RectLib.Perimiter(3<m>, 4<m>)    // ok
