Only a small minority of users have any clue about downgrading.<p>>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a valid comment, or a comment made in good faith, to say that iOS updates are a &quot;bait and switch&quot;.<p>>that Apple supports its older devices MUCH better and for much longer than any competitor.<p>Well, it depends on your viewpoint. How can you &#x27;support&#x27; a device by incrementally making it slower with each passing release? If all they were releasing was bug fixes and patches, and features which didn&#x27;t adversely impact performance then YES I would agree with you. Or hell, I&#x27;d even agree with you with the current situation if Apple allowed downgrades.<p>Seriously, I mean don&#x27;t you think its totally messed up that Apple has to give its permission before you&#x27;re able to downgrade the OS to speed it up when its their own update that slowed it down ? Its ridiculous and should not be accepted as the norm.<p>> you cannot easily downgrade. (It&#x27;s not impossible, it&#x27;s just a huge pain.)<p>Cool, please point the entire world to a working bootrom exploit for the 4s. We&#x27;ve been waiting for a while :)",1419735507
8804986,comment,8803844,8803844,0,0,jcrites,,,"This sounds similar to a technique that I heard about some time ago for overcoming jet lag:<p>Decide what time you want to wake up, locally, in the new time zone. 16 hours before that time, stop eating and sleeping. If possible, try to arrange to fall asleep by 8-6 hours before that time, for a normal night&#x27;s rest.<p>When you wake up the next day, you will be famished. Eat a large, filling breakfast. Supposedly the hunger/full cycle has an impact on the body&#x27;s circadian rhythms, and fasting followed by eating is an especially good way to reset the clock to think &quot;morning&quot; is when you woke up and ate. I read some evolutionary-biology hypothesis that starvation was a larger threat to ancient mankind than sleep deprivation, such that when an individual becomes extremely hungry, the body clock pauses to favor alertness, and then can be switched back on with a large meal.<p>However it works, it&#x27;s worked well for me when I needed to travel long distances (compared to previous trips where I did not).<p>I totally believe that a similar technique could work on a daily basis to help &#x27;anchor&#x27; your sleep to the desired time.<p><a href=""https://hbr.org/2009/05/a-fast-solution-to-jet-lag/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hbr.org/2009/05/a-fast-solution-to-jet-lag/</a>",1419735489

I can&#x27;t help but feel that that sort of attitude is why the more work I take that involves maintaining Rails applications, the less I want to write a new application in Rails... I&#x27;d consider using just plain Rails, though my experiences with the code quality of even some aspects of that aren&#x27;t super great, but most 3rd party Gems for Rails scare the crap out of me at this point in terms of future support burdens.

I started to wonder how come.<p>One question giving me no trouble at all was item 5.  It was obvious to me that the problem was one I often encounter, deciphering the ratios is a skill developed reading countless medical research reports.  After a while it seems natural, it&#x27;s about something <i>salient</i> in my universe.<p>I&#x27;m guessing the item about marital status of individuals, one looking at another, doesn&#x27;t align with the salience of usual experience.  In normal life we have to be sensitive to the context, and in the question that context was deliberately stripped away.  It reduces to a purely abstract notion whereas people, even intelligent ones, really want to know &quot;is she married or not&quot;.  That information is lacking hence the &quot;C&quot; response.<p>Some of the other questions are kind of tricky unless one is familiar with the statistical domain they arrive from.  Sure there&#x27;s a logic involved, but learning how to think in those logical terms is unlikely to occur unless it&#x27;s germane to the individual.<p>If someone I cared about tested positive for the disease (#4), you bet I&#x27;d have good reason to figure out the odds.  Otherwise, probably not.  The motivational aspect is highly relevant and in many cases the &quot;missing link&quot; between intelligence and worse than expected performance.",1419735125

I am working on a widget, which can be plugged into any website add some functionality to it. In order to authenticate against the API, I provide an client token, and a secret.<p>When the client widget authenticates it passes a client generated challenge string, the client token, and a hash which is calculated as hash(challenge+secret). Everything except the secret is available to the client.<p>This scheme is currently vulnerable to copying the challenge string, client token and hash and then reused on any other site. Currently, the only solution I can think of to resolve this is to use short lived (say 20 mins) server generated challenge strings and use those to generate a hash.thus only the client token and hash would be available to the client and that will only be valid for about 20 mins or so.<p>Is there any better way to do this?",1419735117

Earth three and a half billion years ago had life on it, but you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to tell it from orbit.<p>If you want to move to unambiguous (intelligent) life then.......<p>The largest radio telescope we have (the 305 meter diameter Arecibo) would need to have it&#x27;s sensitivity increased by around two orders of magnitude JUST to pick up our TV/FM/AM signals from outside the solar system. So, the crap we pump out the most couldn&#x27;t even be detected by Voyager 2, if we had strapped a giant dish to it.<p>If we move into the narrowband signals then, depending on the source-strength, Arecibo could potentially pick up signals at up to a few thousand light years... if it happened to be pointed in exactly the right direction at exactly the right time.<p>So, our most sensitive instrument is only capable of measuring a fraction of a percent of the spectrum in a fraction of a percent of the possible-directions-it-could-be-pointed if the point source happened to be sending a strong enough signal (aimed at us) at exactly the right time (which would be anywhere between 2 and a few thousand years ago).<p>I haven&#x27;t done the math, but I suspect that regardless of the frequency and amount of energy we dump into sending out a signal (within the realms of not being scifi, anyhow), it would be impossible for anyone to detect us a thousand or two lightyears out (using EM radiation) without knowing when/where to look.

Get the &quot;big idea&quot; stuff done while you&#x27;re on the toilet, driving, taking a shower, getting lunch. Keeping the project &quot;loaded&quot; in your head helps to predict architectural issues, makes it easier to break the project down into smaller pieces, makes it easier to get started coding, and keeps you motivated to work on it.<p>Choose a list of small things that need to be done. Every project has them. Don&#x27;t try to get the small thing done completely right the first time. For example, say my project needs to be able to read email headers. How should it go about that? (Think about that throughout the day.) It will need a function that reads a message and spits out the headers separate from the body. Write that, that&#x27;s easy. Then it&#x27;ll need a function that reads each line of the headers, and returns them as an array. Write that, that&#x27;s easy. Then it&#x27;ll need another function that takes each element of the headers array and splits them into label: value pairs. Write that, that&#x27;s easy.<p>A nice side effect of this approach is that you end up with some very clean code. Each function does one thing, does it well, and its output feeds naturally into the input of the next function.<p>Build a library like this. If you only have 30 minutes at a time, your personal library of code is essential. Maintain and organize it. (That&#x27;s another thing that can be done in 30 minute chunks.) Keep a notes file open in a tab in your IDE and do regular brain dumps to it. Write unit tests, or go back and do cleanup on a function that needs cleaning up.<p>Then, on a regular basis -- at least once a week, in my case -- retreat to a coffee shop or call up a buddy you have that&#x27;s a writer, and set a &quot;productivity day&quot;. The key is to get out of your regular environment and have another person with you. You each end up pushing the other to focus and be productive. Use this time to put all of your functions together, do some testing, and build scaffolding for the &quot;big&quot; parts of your project. My session about a week ago netted me almost 1,000 lines of added/deleted/modified code, according to Github.<p>It&#x27;s a very different approach from the usual method of &quot;sit down and bang it out for hours,&quot; but it works, and it helps to defeat all that mindset about flow that other programmers struggle with.",1419734412

Consider a proposition such that &quot;for all list L, there is a list L&#x27; such that L&#x27; is sorted and L&#x27; is a permutation of L&quot;.  From a constructive proof of that proposition, you can extract a sorting algorithm. This works basically because the constructive proof has to exhibit a witness. That&#x27;s the kind of things you can do with the Coq proof assistant.<p>&quot;you may not be able to prove that Anne is married or prove that Anne is unmarried, but can&#x27;t you prove by that Anne is either married or unmarried, by the definition of marriege?&quot;<p>You can&#x27;t prove it in constructive logic.

As these costs increase, the people actually earning above and beyond the basic income will be have their income redistributed in the form of high taxes and depending on how high these costs increase over time, will reach a point where the reward != effort.

Why would I even bother putting the effort into working when I can get almost the same amount of money back from the government, for free?
