8763357,comment,8761789,8762619,0,0,icefox,,,"Yeah I have played around with those and either written myself or been part of a team that wrote at least a half dozen browsers that were released and dozens of little R&D browsers.  I have also seen many many browsers that offer very little beyond Chrome/Firefox come and go.  Yes they might have a very good idea, but it is not enough to get someone to change browsers.  A tweak, climbing higher up the local hill, but not fundamentally changing the game.  A few of the big points in the article I wrote have to do with the idea that private browsing as known today is flat out wrong and not what users want, having a split view, and robust local access control.  Living with a hacked up browser for a month that did these really showed that they were a big deal.  But alas after an acquisition my new (former) employer forbid me from working on it so it had to be shelved.  But even today I don&#x27;t know if what I wrote about is going far enough.  For most users browsers are like internet speed.  The important thing isn&#x27;t what speed you are connecting, but that you are connected period.<p>Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on how you look at it) it isn&#x27;t 2004 where almost no browser development was occurring and you could have something &quot;new&quot; like Firefox come to light and grow quickly with very little features against almost no competition.  These days you have many large companies funding development teams to keep what we have today working and make marginally better each day.  To make a new browser you can&#x27;t just take Chrome and tack on a tiny tweak you need step changes.  That is what my 2009 article was about and with a few more years of thought and experienced that is what I have been messing around with lately, making a browser where users abandon Chrome/FireFox/IE not because it is a tiny bit better because it is so better it isn&#x27;t about switching, but about moving to a different product.",1418839167

Its nearness to the equator makes it ideally placed for launches into geostationary transfer orbit as few changes have to be made to a satellite’s trajectory.<p>> Launchers also profit from the ‘slingshot’ effect, that is the energy created by the speed of the Earth’s rotation around the axis of the Poles.

As far as we currently know, the dynamo effect is caused by the action of molten material against a rotating solid inner core. It&#x27;s true that our magnetosphere keeps the atmosphere in, but having a magnetic field is far from uncommon or unexpected for a planet of Earth&#x27;s size and composition. In fact, Mars - a planet lacking powerful moons - once had a magnetic field just like ours. The problem here is the size of the planet was not sufficient to keep enough heat inside for as long as ours has.<p>You might be conflating this with the theory that the Moon stabilizes the Earth&#x27;s rotational axis and prevents it from wobbling too strongly, which would cause unpredictable summers and winters, kind of like the ones described in A Song of Ice and Fire.<p>Yes, the Earth-Moon system probably has some uncommon features, but let&#x27;s not make the mistake to postulate that a world has to be <i>precisely</i> like Earth in order to support intelligent life.

8763281,comment,8762728,8762728,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I don&#x27;t like Uber or its founder, but I find it fascinating.<p>I&#x27;m starting to think that technological growth&#x27;s self-limiting dynamic might be the generation of cheap labor. Ultimately, technical progress <i>isn&#x27;t needed</i> if labor is cheap. You&#x27;re not going to find much audience for modern agriculture in countries where farm laborers can be paid $5 per day. Sure, there are things that the very rich might theoretically want (just as Henry VIII would have had a better life with antibiotics) but since they tend to measure prosperity and status in relative terms, they don&#x27;t have the imagination to push anything forward. Instead, elites retrench and block progress. It&#x27;s only when labor is expensive (or in a war, which will make labor expensive if it carries on for long enough, due to depopulation) that anyone in power is willing to fund technology. Of course, those with the resources would <i>rather</i> find cheap labor overseas if that&#x27;s an option; excluding a small set of celebrity visionaries who are less than 1% of the elite, they only invest in technical growth as a last resort.<p>Uber isn&#x27;t at fault for the abundance of cheap labor that has made &quot;the Uber Economy&quot; possible, but poorly managed technological progress is. If technological progress slows in the 21st century (I don&#x27;t expect it to halt or regress, but it could slow to an uninspiring crawl and give us a disappointing &quot;lost century&quot;) it will be due to the demotivation of investment encouraged by an abundance of cheap labor. For all the complaint about &quot;talent shortage&quot; by Silicon Valley executives, the fact is that no such thing exists; there are plenty of unemployed or underemployed PhDs out there. If there were a real talent shortage, the classism and sexism and ageism that characterize the contemporary VC-funded culture wouldn&#x27;t be affordable, and you&#x27;d see all sorts of people (currently below a ceiling) getting coveted opportunities.<p>In an ideal world, we&#x27;d stop this from happening by training people up, out of the jobs no longer needed, in order to be ready for the new jobs created by technology. In practice, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be what&#x27;s happening. Laid-off factory workers in Detroit (and Ferguson, MO) aren&#x27;t being sent to school and trained for the new jobs; they&#x27;ve just been abandoned.<p>Uber seems to capture the next phase of the Silicon Valley society. There&#x27;s no basic research or fundamental innovation, but we&#x27;re seeing new ideas around what to do with the abundance of dislocated and unemployed or underemployed people. Zynga&#x27;s another one: capitalizing on middle-class ennui. Ultimately, this might explain, in part, the increasing dislike of Silicon Valley that we&#x27;ve seen in the past five years. Silicon Valley isn&#x27;t singularly or even mainly responsible for deindustrialization and cultural decay, but the modern incarnation seems to be most strongly oriented toward profiting from it.",1418838399

New windows pop up and quickly assume their rightful space and everything just looks so darn tidy.<p>But for certain usage patterns, that doesn&#x27;t get you a lot.

8763231,comment,8762539,8763165,0,0,dennismckinnon,,,"We have trouble securing one blockchain because of the consensus method it uses. The idea behind thelonious is you can still have verifiable databases with various levels of untrusted-ness. Its our work towards blockchains which allow you to experiment with various parameters regarding trusted ness for example which coinbases are allowed to mine. Not just that but the blockchain is controlled by smart contracts on the blockchain itself. So over time these things can change. Once vm-base consensus is perfected (we have it somewhat working but want to add in a lot of additional capabilities) you will be able to fully program the chain consensus model on the chain itself.<p>Thelonious is only one component however. We made it to address some issues we have with fully decentralized  (and uncontrollable) blockchains such as bitcoin which might make some people/corporations nervous. Its designed to give dapp makers what they want in a blockchain but it isn&#x27;t needed.<p>The decerver is the part that makes all the other p2p components work in harmony to give a single platform capable of allowing you to use bitcoin, ethereum, thelonius, ipfs etc all from a scriptable platform that runs on a local users machine. In the new year we plan on working through dynamic module loading meaning that if you want to use a blockchain employing SNARK-based proofs you can. Just write a wrapper. We will be looking into incorporating SNARK-based proofs into thelonious but with decerver you don&#x27;t NEED us to give you the parts. We are hoping to make it so you can build the modules you want to use and the dapps you want to build on top of them. Thats our goal with this. Its not about one blockchain. Its about bringing together all of the P2P space.<p>Does that answer your question?",1418837943

The company was in bad state (from 1993 to 1997 there were four different CEOs), their offerings too expensive, and with too few applications running on them and no clear strategy for the company. They were a relevant punching bag primarily because they were the only Non-Microsoft computer that people had ever heard of; and a lot of schools had Apple ][e&#x27;s (a few macs, but many more Apple ][e&#x27;s). The main place where Macs were managing to maintain some marketshare was in, as you have noticed, media and publishing. For a while, Photoshop was the primary killer app for the macs, and is still (last I checked) the de facto standard for it&#x27;s domain.<p>Their image drastically improved when Jobs came back. He launched the &quot;Think Different Campaign&quot;, the iMac&#x27;s with the hockey puck mice (also, he got an injection of $150 million from Microsoft and a commitment from them to build the Internet Explorer for the Mac), and finally delivered a modern operating system (Mac Fans were in denial about how bad the OS was prior to X). Jobs provided a compelling narrative that the media loved telling, of a man banished from the company he founded, and returning to save it from destruction. Also, the perception was that he&#x27;d also have to take on Microsoft, so he had the whole &quot;David and Goliath&quot; thing going for him as well. The popularity of this story is effectively why something like &quot;Pirates of Silicon Valley&quot; got made.<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure why mac laptops have gotten such traction in the dev community; but it&#x27;s not because media studies is broadening to cover the web.",1418837357

(Python is full of it&#x27;s own gotcha&#x27;s for example)<p>Knowing the gotcha&#x27;s of the language is important, but a competent developer also understands patterns and disciplines.<p>For example, it&#x27;s often times that DRY is perverted into a framework that obfuscates that actual work being done and makes not only the code untestable but also debugging a nightmare.  It&#x27;d okay to repeat yourself as long as it provides clarity over obfuscation.  But when is too much repeating too much? How would you fix it?  Refactor? Rewrite?  This perversion isn&#x27;t exclusive to PHP at all.<p>On the PHP front, in addition to frantzmiccoli&#x27;s great questions I would add the following:
- have you installed and used xdebug?
- you ever done code profiling with xhprof ?",1418837351

There&#x27;s nothing about the railroad meaning of the term that would imply the computer science meaning.  A counter that can never go below zero is entirely unrelated to a pivoting arm.  Once you know the connection it can serve as something of a reminder, but that&#x27;s different from having an intuitive understanding in the first place.<p>EDIT: Getting from RR semaphore to CS semaphore requires several leaps of intuition.  On the railroad side you need to recognize that it is a signal that&#x27;s important, and it&#x27;s irrelevant whether that signal is implemented as a semaphore, an electric signal, or even a flagman.  On the computer science side you need to know the difference between a semaphore and the many other types of mutual exclusion mechanisms.<p>So in that sense &quot;semaphore&quot; is poorly named: it provides insufficient context to distinguish the concept from other similar, yet distinct, ideas.",1418837137

If you have <i>direct reports</i> in N different timezones, and there&#x27;s almost no functional overlap between some of those timezones and your own, then why are they your direct reports? You are fundamentally incapable of directly managing them, and they are incapable of directly reporting to you. Put a better org structure in place, and shed whatever reasons you have for insisting on those people&#x27;s directness -- be they playing to people&#x27;s vanity, an overreaching desire to be &quot;flat,&quot; or something else entirely.<p>(Obviously, this is easier said than done. At that level, the politics of moving around direct-reporting lines is going to be a nightmare.)<p>But I do agree. The complexity of scheduling increases dramatically as the number of timezones N increases. You try the best you can to schedule a standing meeting that accommodates everyone.

Yet, this article will help those that know about jQuery, and want to learn more about the strengths AngularJS has to offer. Specifically, the comparison shows what both of these tools are good at, and empowers you to know what one best fits the needs of your application.<p>There are a several factors that will help you decide whether or not to use AngularJS. In my opinion it&#x27;s not so much how complex the user interface is, although that is certainly relevant. The first thing to consider is where you want to put your application logic, server-side or client-side. The more things you want to push down to the client, the more likely AngularJS will better fit your needs. Are you creating a single page application where url-to-resource routing is done in JavaScript, or will that be handled server-side? Will you be merging data with templates on the server, on the client, or both? I suggest you look at the &quot;too long; didn&#x27;t read&quot; chart in the article, and see if you need the features AngularJS provides. How important is it to you that your client-side code is testable? While it is possible to unit test jQuery code, the way most developers write nested callbacks tightly coupled to event handlers, does not lend itself easily to isolated testing. Finally, you need to decide if your team wants to embrace the declarative style of application development advocated by AngularJS. Such as using the directive ng-click vs. $(elm).click(). This will most likely require a change in mindset, and should be carefully weighed.",1418835971

To say this situation is any different in the absence of hard evidence, would be naive. (Edit, OP provided the aforementioned evidence that Google did have a competitive reason to do this.)<p>They have a rich history of stomping on little guys as well as being a masterclass in the, &quot;do what I say, not what I do&quot; sort of hypocrisy that always seems to come from those with great power. In my eyes, they&#x27;ve <i>long</i> lost the benefit of the doubt when it comes to matters like this. Google holds a lot of utility for me and I use their products daily, but I hold no illusions as to their predatory nature.<p>1) Google has claimed non-existent partnerships with their competitors in direct marketing of a competing product. They were literally calling their competitor&#x27;s customers on the phone, saying they were a partner of the competing company, and hard selling that company&#x27;s customers to sign up for their product.[1]<p>2) Google has the honor of receiving the largest civil penalty the Federal Trade Commission has ever imposed for overriding their user&#x27;s privacy settings in Apple&#x27;s Safari browser.[2] For some perspective: this fine was 0.1 percent of Larry Page&#x27;s net worth, or what Google takes in over the course of about 5 hours.<p>3) Google search makes a regular habit of scraping other web sites and displaying ads against the content, something explicitly banned by their ToS for Adwords users.[3]<p>4) Google search also regularly shows upwards of 75% ads on a page. For instance, a search for &quot;Kansas City real estate&quot; returns you nine ads and three organic search results when viewed on a 2560 x 1440 screen[4] (15&quot; MacBook Pro). This is explicitly against their policy, &quot;Publishers should avoid site layouts in which the ads push content below the fold. These layouts make it hard for users to distinguish between the content and ads.&quot;[5] This also violates their add limit per page[6] laid out in their ToS.<p>5) This might be my favorite.

If she was late almost all the time, and by 45 minutes or more each time, then it&#x27;s patently irresponsible. She should have set a different time for the meeting every week. Or she should have blocked out her schedule to make the time. On the other hand, if she was late maybe 25% of the time, that&#x27;s a different story. The CEO of a huge corporation is going to be late to a lot of meetings. It&#x27;s the nature of the job. There isn&#x27;t enough time in the working day for all the people, situations, and projects she needs to handle.<p>Having worked every now and then with C-level executives at huge companies, some much bigger than Yahoo, I can tell you that they&#x27;re often late to meetings. Staff meetings especially, because staff meetings are standing, and standing meetings usually lose in an ad-hoc triage battle against spur-of-the-moment meetings. Almost axiomatically, anyone or anything important enough to hijack a CEO&#x27;s time is going to be important enough to win the priority battle against a standing staff meeting.<p>All of that said, &quot;invariably&quot; needs to be defined here. Especially given the circumstances, i.e., requiring all direct reports in various timezones to be there every Monday on Mayer&#x27;s clock. If it was, indeed, &quot;invariable&quot; -- as in, she was <i>always</i> at least 45 minutes late -- then she should have found a new time for the meeting.
