These goals are at odds, and I hope the latter is not sacrificed in the app economy.<p>You&#x27;re right that the tourism industry is probably the worst case for democracy to ensure accountability of regulators to the people. But at least all punishments imposed by the government are subject to the court system; the government does not take away your license to make an income without evidence that you actually violated a law. Furthermore, government is subject to other mechanisms to be accountable to the people e.g. FOIA requests (vs Uber, who keeps their data exclusively for themselves).

The current situation with voice and text is insane; telephone companies still try to own that space and charge for things like SMS/receiving calls, even though it&#x27;s becoming increasingly obvious that it makes far more sense to send messaging over the internet rather than via custom infrastructure. No-one wants cell phone/telephone operators to be anything more than a dumb pipe apart from them.<p>Apps like this are the future, but nobody has quite hit the perfect spot yet in terms of features and adoption (adoption probably being most important, or some method of piggy-backing on existing services like email/SMS/mobile nos). I had a look at this and it looks pretty good but the first-run experience just isn&#x27;t there yet.

I think you kind of have to choose one.<p>Oh sure, the initial code was pretty terrible. But by the time we were moving parts to Java it had all gone through a lesser or greater amount of refactoring; the best design is iterative and emergent, and we had the <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatIsAnAdvancer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhatIsAnAdvancer</a> experience several times over.

Because with the current technology, even if we do have manned mission to mars, if a meteor wipes out earth there will be no living humans on mars either. With the current technology any human mission to mars can only be on mars for a very limited time and will rely on earth for all of their resources. Thus, if a meteor wipes out earth, any mission to mars will die too.<p>If you want to build a sustainable mars presence, a manned mission to mars is not going to do it. We have to find a way to use resources on mars to sustain a human presence. That will require a lot of research into mars resources, a lot of engineering to build mars factories etc. I am not sure if this is possible at all but if it is, it is best done by starting with robotic missions. A robot can spend a year on mars looking for materials that can be used to make bricks (for example). A human, even if we can get him on mars, will probably have to go back in hours.",1417599929

After initialization a for statement repeats &quot;test; body; advance&quot;, this is ideal for counting up loops, but what we need for counting down loops is &quot;test; advance; body&quot;. Since C/C++ do not provide the latter as a primitive you have to use a while loop as shown above. Using a signed integer to shoehorn a counting down loop into a for statement at the cost of 1/2 your range is a hack IMO.

Yes there are many updates on the libraries, but they mostly update to versions which are lot older than the ones released in Javascript. (e.g. Polymer: 0.5.2)
The hard part is therefor to maintain the libraries of dart while the JS projects move on very quickly.

Microsoft only promised not to sue over certain kinds of patent infringement in core libraries; that promise didn&#x27;t extend to code you wrote on top of those libraries, which is unsurprising. Unfortunately they&#x27;ve patented a bunch of common ways of using .NET functionality, including many of the things you might use LINQ for and one of the most common idioms for using delegagtes and events. (Both of the commonly used GUI libraries - Windows.Forms and Gtk# - infringe the latter patent. So if you&#x27;re running a GUI-based .NET app on anything but Windows then Microsoft can sue you if they ever decide it&#x27;s to their advantage to do so.)",1417598797

I believe we have only 2 mechanical eng people and the rest is CS guys.<p>It&#x27;s not resume or education background bias. However, if you&#x27;re going to pay in the 150k-200k euro range to somebody, you naturally want them to have relevant experience. After ee undergrad, I majored in signal processing and then got a phd in cv. Hiring people in the hopes that they&#x27;ll become useful is being done but not excessively in a way that it is counter-productive ( eg. we&#x27;re not hiring number theorists but accept applied maths guys - one new hire (one of our immigrant workers) has a very cool phd thesis on probability and the data he worked with came from CERN experiments - so it&#x27;s not CV or PR at all - pure math applied on physics experiments... but he&#x27;s smart and experienced enough that after only 3 months he&#x27;s already doing substantial contributions )<p>cv/pr is not a field where you have a &#x27;modest learning curve&#x27; if you hire people to do research - you really need at least a few years of research experience for working on state-of-the-art problems... otherwise, you&#x27;re paying people to develop their research skills at a very high premium. that should be done at a university...<p>maybe I&#x27;m biased - I always consider this H1B problem in terms of research work - not regular stuff where what you need to do is 95% engineering and 5% research.. this is my bias. but it is also a valid example for H1B discussion in contrast to dismissing all H1B immigrant workers as &#x27;cheap labor&#x27; for doing engineering tasks with low requirements.<p>The US is a country spanning a large continent - maybe that is the reason for many of the racist rants I&#x27;ve seen here on this discussion - it doesn&#x27;t have many neighbouring countries ( and at odds with all of them except maybe Canada? ) and most US citizens don&#x27;t leave the states to work in other parts of the world. If you have a whole continent for a country it&#x27;s easier to find a job in a different part of it than moving to a completely different culture. And so this sort of causes people who don&#x27;t travel much to have a conservative view of &#x27;immigrant&#x27; labor. EU is definitely not perfect and has many problems to solve - but at least, in my opinion, opening the borders for quota-free worker exchanges lets people to hire from a richer pool of talent and helps reduce culture clashes and racist viewpoints in the long term. I&#x27;m feeling very lucky to get to know many different cultures from all around the world. I wish you could also have a taste of it too...",1417598603

Nature sensors are really continuous exponential, even touch.<p>The same happens with our ears. So you are doing an spectral analysis using an arithmetic frequency decomposer called the FFT?<p>Well, sorry to burst your bubble but the cloclea frequency analysis runs circles around anything we have.

We think it&#x27;s because she is a non-native speaker: in her head she has to translate what is said to her own native language to make sense of it, which might interfere with the memory being formed (and if it turns our her memory of the sentence is more &quot;semantic&quot; than &quot;literal&quot;, she also has to translate that memory back to English when remembering).<p>After we figured this out we&#x27;ve managed to avoid that cause of pointless fights. It did require recorded proof to convince her that her memory was as fallible as mine though - like Tyson in the article she was overconfident in its reliability.",1417597465

I gave him five stars, of course.<p>Why? I wonder if the author would continually frequent a deli that regularly served him rotten meat out of some misplaced sense of guilt.<p>> He wouldn’t let us out of the cab until she promised to [give 5 stars]. Afterward, we agreed: That was a pretty annoying ride, but not so bad it was worth punishing someone financially over it.<p>Yeah, I always find it annoying when I get quasi-kidnapped too. But who&#x27;s to blame the kidnappers? Petty corruption and extortion is a totally acceptable part of life in a civilized society! It&#x27;s not as if there were some sort of completely anonymous, dead-simple mechanism to instantly eliminate this sort of behavior.<p>> Most regular Uber users have a story like this.<p>I don&#x27;t, nor have I heard any such thing from anyone I know. Where&#x27;s the data to back this statement?<p>> my sample wasn’t big enough to generate anything I’d call data<p>Ergo, you have no business writing authoritatively on this subject.<p>> Why would Uber invite riders to use a scale of one to five unless it wants them to make fine distinctions? But in practice, it means a rating intended by a user as a gesture of approval is in fact a vote to have a driver fired. That’s screwed up.<p>If it&#x27;s so screwed up, then why would anyone drive for Uber? Surely, all of their drivers would be getting fired and no one would want to work for them if that were the case. The fact is, it&#x27;s not, and the reason is clear if you have a basic understanding of statistics, particularly normal distributions.<p>> Uber likes this system because it enjoys being able to say all of its drivers have near-perfect ratings. But it’s a harsh one for drivers, and also for customers, who find themselves repeatedly forced to choose between guilt, spite and ignorance.<p>Again, if it&#x27;s so harsh, why would either group voluntarily participate in the system? Nobody is forcing either side to participate, and yet they both do so in droves.<p>> Fundamentally, a five-star rating is far too simple.<p>And yet the article you cite advocates something radically simpler.",1417597462
