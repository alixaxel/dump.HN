8709208,comment,8708873,8709076,0,0,mercurial,,,"> Lets not make it harder than it is.<p>Sure. Either your hosting provider supports your language of choice out of the box, or it doesn&#x27;t. If it does, deployment will be simple. If it doesn&#x27;t you still need to configure a web server and install whatever package you need (for comparison, here is how you configure Apache for the Flask Python framewrok [1], I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s significantly harder than configuring Apache for PHP).<p>> The limits of the language means nothing to 95% of it&#x27;s users and even when they do as in the case of facebook it&#x27;s a problem of success and has been solved.<p>Well, &quot;Bobby tables&quot; and XSS don&#x27;t mean anything to a lot of people. It doesn&#x27;t mean that PHP has acquired a sane templating system out of the box, that it&#x27;s stdlib has acquired consistency or that it suddenly got hold of a type system. PHP is widely supported by hosting providers, and it does make it easy for inexperienced people to use it. That&#x27;s, IMHO, its real strong point. Apart from that, it doesn&#x27;t do anything better than other mainstream dynamic languages, and it does a lot of things considerably worse.<p>1: <a href=""http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/deploying/mod_wsgi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/deploying/mod_wsgi/</a>",1417873768

I don&#x27;t understand why you even started talking about JSON; the article was about why XML and XSLT suck, not why JSON is superior to them.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure what point you&#x27;re making. JSON is meant to make passing data in JavaScript easier. It&#x27;s a necessary tool for interactive, JavaScript-heavy web frontends. I&#x27;m not sure why there&#x27;s so much condescension in your post for JSON and its tooling. I&#x27;m just a bit confused; it comes off like you have a personal stake in XML and you find any mention of JSON, even obliquely, as offensive.<p>There&#x27;s no reason that XML and JSON can&#x27;t both be tools we use when the situation calls for it.

I like the code, though, lots of work has been done.<p>It&#x27;s worth bearing in mind that messages per second is important, but it&#x27;s easy to get fixated on benchmark porn.<p>Different queueing systems have different guarantees, disciplines and semantics. These affect user-facing behaviour, which tends to be more important at first blush than throughput.<p>I like zillions of messages per second as much as the next fellow. But frequently you need to worry about things like:<p>* Are messages delivered once and only once?<p>* Are messages are messages delivered at least once?<p>* Can messages be dropped entirely under pressure? (aka best effort)<p>* If they drop under pressure, how is pressure measured? Is there a back-pressure mechanism?<p>* Can consumers and producers look into the queue, or is it totally opaque?<p>* Is queueing unordered, FIFO or prioritised?<p>* Is there a broker or no broker?<p>* Does the broker own independent, named queues (topics, routes etc) or do producers and consumers need to coordinate their connections?<p>* Is queueing durable or ephemeral?<p>* Is durability achieved by writing every message to disk first, or by replicating messages across servers?<p>* Is queueing partially/totally consistent across a group of servers or divided up for maximal throughput?<p>* Is message posting transactional?<p>* Is message receiving transactional?<p>* Do consumers block on receive or can they check for new messages?<p>* Do producers block on send or can they check for queue fullness?<p>And there&#x27;s probably a bunch more I&#x27;ve forgotten.<p>The thing is that answers to these questions will fundamentally change both the functional and non-functional nature of your queueing system.<p>For example, a queue system giving best-effort, unordered, non-durable behaviour is going to run a <i>lot</i> faster. It also pushes a lot of work onto the application programmer. On the other hand, once-and-only-once, durable, consistent queues are lot slower and screech to a halt under most partition conditions. But they also fit what most application developers expect to happen upon the first encounter with queueing systems.<p>I work on a section of Cloud Foundry in my day job, and other teams have seen that different tasks require different queueing approaches.<p>For example, stuff like metrics is is still useful under conditions of dropping messages, out-of-order messages and so on, because what&#x27;s interesting is the statistics, not any one single measurement.<p>But a message like &quot;start this app&quot; requires much higher guarantees of ordering, durability, delivery certainty. People get mad if your PaaS doesn&#x27;t actually run the application you asked it to run.<p>So, just remember: queues are not queues. You need to compare delivered apples with lossy oranges.<p>As a note, the author observes that MQTT provides an option to select which delivery semantics you prefer (at-least-once, at-most-once / best-effort, once-and-only-once), but I can&#x27;t see which one the benchmark is run for.",1417871166

In fact, I don&#x27;t think JSON is very human friendly at all[0],  which is OK for a data interchange format, occasionally <i>read</i> by humans but hardly ever <i>written</i> by hand.<p>I did not further develop RELAX JSON, however, when I realized that TypeScript interface definitions[1] are a <i>great</i> JSON schema language:<p><pre><code>    enum Color { Yellow, Brown }; 

    interface Banana {
        color: Color;
        length: number;
    }

    interface FruitBasket {
        bananas: Array<Banana>;
        apples:  Array<{color: Color; radius: number}>?;
    }

It&#x27;s best to use interfaces and not classes, because interfaces allow for optional fields (with the `?` suffix), which is pretty common in APIs and wherever JSON is used.<p>I will write a validate-JSON-with-TypeScript-type-definitions checker as soon as I find a need for it.

I thought the same with so many technologies that I got into. I always thought KISS was nice and I always felt like abstraction is a good way to reach that KISS.<p>Turns out it is not. Things can fail, really badly even and they do fail, really often even, even when there are companies with big pockets standing behind it and then good luck debugging the mess. This is true even for really proven technologies, but might be less obvious on those.<p>At some point when you are good at some technology, even if it&#x27;s really popular, mainstream, be it some big SQL database (yes, all of PG, SQLite and MySQL even though I love some of those), C, C++, Java, C# or Python/Ruby/Perl/Node.js you will constantly end up with the implementation of the underlying technology.<p>I am not saying XSLT or any of the above don&#x27;t have their use cases, but actually that a lot of them are over-engineered. Using most of these technologies I know there are issues, send bug reports and patches and hey, things get fixed really quickly. That&#x27;s all good and you never can fully avoid these things, but the more simpler you get the less there is that end up biting you and causing you to start out with lets say you having your SASS to CSS compiler having an issue, digging deeper through every library finding a GCC bug or whatever.
