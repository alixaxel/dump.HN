8797854,comment,8795732,8795732,0,0,throwawaybcporn,,,"This reminds me of my Facebook interview. The coding question was &quot;given an array of all the words in the English language, print an array of arrays containing all the anagrams&quot;. In studying for the interview, I&#x27;d just refreshed on recursion and, in my general nervousness + excitement thinking I&#x27;d just been asked a question I&#x27;d <i>literally</i> studied an hour before, went right to work generating all the anagrams of each word in the English language.<p>About 5 minutes after the call ended, my jaw dropped open and I slapped my forehead. To find the anagrams of a word, just parse the set and remove any words that are (a) the same length and (b) contain the same numbers of each letter in the original.<p>Fizz buzz. And I made it like 1000x harder.<p>A generous interviewer would say, &quot;Well at least he knows recursion and can do it on the fly in a stressful situation&quot;. But this is Facebook and they don&#x27;t have to be generous. I gave them a reason to say &quot;no&quot; and then they said &quot;no&quot;.<p>But as for &quot;dysfunctional jokes&quot;, I have to agree (and you can tell from my OP that I have plenty of experience with it). Asking someone to code on the fly is like asking someone to write a novella on the fly. You need focus and concentration. By demanding it with someone breathing into your ear the whole time, you&#x27;re simply giving those who are better able to handle pressure an advantage and those who can&#x27;t a disadvantage. If this were a bomb-diffusal position, you&#x27;d want to filter for that. But this is coding, so what should pressure-handling matter?",1419562719

Not because I don&#x27;t understand the concepts behind what is being represented, but because I have a hard time getting a handle on the shape of things.<p>It&#x27;s a matter of familiarity, and while I&#x27;ve spent some time looking at the object model I haven&#x27;t written a lot of code in it. So perhaps that complaint is only really valid for newcomers. On the other hand, I still think it&#x27;s a bit convoluted since a language like Io can express much the same stuff with less. The postcard version is something like:<p><pre><code>    Object setSlot(&quot;foo&quot;, 12);

I think that&#x27;s shat Smalltalk ought to look like, since that&#x27;s what it&#x27;s trying to be about.<p>Edit: Before anyone gets the wrong idea, I don&#x27;t mean Smalltalk should look like Io, but that it should have little more shape than looking like message sends.",1419561983

While we may not know the original language in which the gospel of Matthew is written, it is written for a Jewish audience and seems to be one of the most colorful, with e.g. many dead saints coming back to life, begging the question of why no one else bothered to write about this stuff. In any event, if this did indeed happen then it&#x27;s another example of something that doesn&#x27;t fit our worldview today that nevertheless can take place, like black swans and freak waves.<p>On a related note, the Hebrew word for &quot;wife&quot; and &quot;woman&quot; are the same. And the same is true of Greek. So quotes of Jesus such as <a href=""http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-28.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-28.htm</a> are probably mistranslated, since it doesn&#x27;t make sense that two unmarried people can commit adultery, so it&#x27;s likely that the original word was &quot;wife&quot;. And yet because of these translations so many young people&#x27;s sexual desires were repressed so that they might not look lustfully at any woman, married or not. Whenever I ask other Christians about this kind of stuff, they never seem to have a good answer but continue to insist that it should be &quot;woman&quot;, and that young men should still not look with lust at any woman.",1419560376

Page 12:<p>&quot;A striking result of our study is that LaTeX users are highly satisfied with their system despite reduced usability and productivity. From a psychological perspective, this finding may be related to motivational factors, i.e., the driving forces that compel or reinforce individuals to act in a certain way to achieve a desired goal. A vital motivational factor is the tendency to reduce cognitive dissonance. According to the theory of cognitive dissonance, each individual has a motivational drive to seek consonance between their beliefs and their actual actions. If a belief set does not concur with the individual’s actual behavior, then it is usually easier to change the belief rather than the behavior [6]. The results from many psychological studies in which people have been asked to choose between one of two items (e.g., products, objects, gifts, etc.) and then asked to rate the desirability, value, attractiveness, or usefulness of their choice, report that participants often reduce unpleasant feelings of cognitive dissonance by rationalizing the chosen alternative as more desirable than the unchosen alternative [6, 7]. This bias is usually unconscious and becomes stronger as the effort to reject the chosen alternative increases, which is similar in nature to the case of learning and using LaTeX.&quot;",1419560249

It seems sad, to a historian, that a great empire would &quot;collapse&quot; (an affair that usually happen imperceptibly over hundreds of years) but the reality is that it&#x27;s the unintended product of millions of individuals making self-interested and possibly self-beneficial decisions... that end up not keeping up or advancing the civilization. At some point, they just decide that it&#x27;s not worth it to be civilized anymore, and investment ceases.<p>Since the 1970s, we&#x27;ve seen elective decline in the U.S., in science, and in technology. Abstractly people <i>want</i> scientific progress, but no one wants to pay for it, and people within the masses would rather be guided by their resentment of academics than fight back when academic or research jobs get cut. When state legislatures cut funding for public universities, the hoi polloi don&#x27;t care because their resentment for professors is stronger than their sense of a need to keep up the society.<p>One might hope for Silicon Valley to be better, and look to it for leadership, and it may have kept its integrity for longer, but the current &quot;M&A has replaced R&D&quot; era is just fucking disgusting. It&#x27;s easy to focus the hatred on a few unlikeable celebrity founders (and I&#x27;ve done my share of that) but the truth is that the problem is really deep and probably unalterable. We have a front-row seat, if we work in science and technology in the U.S., for elective decline-- why it happens, the individual actors who push it forward (not <i>wanting</i> decline, but valuing self-interest more), and the often one-way erosion of trust that tends to make it irreversible-- but we have no power to change it. And, just as one might read about a civilization that collapsed 3,000 years ago and think, &quot;They would have been fine if they just <X>&quot;, we can easily come up with solutions that will work but never see implementation, because (as seems to be a constant of human organizations) the wrong people are in charge.",1419559546

From what I gather, the participants in the study were required to <i>reproduce</i> the formatting and layout of the sample text. In theory, a LaTeX file should strictly be a semantic representation of the content of the document; while TeX may have been a raw typesetting language, this is most definitely <i>not</i> the intended use case of LaTeX and is overall a very poor test of its relative advantages and capabilities.<p>The separation of the semantic definition of the content from the rendering of the document is, in my opinion, the most important feature of LaTeX. Like CSS, this allows the actual formatting to be abstracted away, allowing plain (marked-up) content to be written without worrying about typesetting.<p>Word has some similar capabilities with styles, and can be used in a similar manner, though few Word users actually use the software properly. This may sound like a relatively insignificant point, but in practice, almost every Word document I have seen has some form of inconsistent formatting. If Word disallowed local formatting changes (including things such as relative spacing of nested bullet points), forcing all formatting changes to be done in document-global styles, it would be a far better typesetting system. Also, the users would be <i>very</i> unhappy.<p>Yes, LaTeX can undeniably be a pain in the arse, especially when it comes to trying to get figures in the right place; however the combination of a simple, semantic plain-text representation with a flexible and professional typesetting and rendering engine are undeniable and completely unaddressed by this study.",1419559207
