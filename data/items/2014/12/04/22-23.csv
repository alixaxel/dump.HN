And, most of the time, we&#x27;re more than happy to promote (especially smaller partners) to that status in good faith without any paper work.<p>> What about prioritization, you may ask?<p>The list I provided above in terms of recruitment/opportunity criteria? That&#x27;s prioritized.<p>My team has to prioritize the tremendous interest from some of the largest as well as some of the smallest companies in the world<p>A guiding principle is that special attention paid to those who make a commitment (and have shown ) to contribute their learning upstream - either via code contribution, proposal, activity on IRC, etc. I/we spend a tremendous amount of time on all of the feedback channels (like this one) to know who is active and from there form a relationship. If you follow my activity on any of these forums, you&#x27;ll probably see a lot of &quot;hey what you&#x27;re doing is awesome. lets chat more&quot; That&#x27;s usually how it starts.<p>I hope that helps, and my inbox/calendar/time is always open for a conversation.

I used 4 different methods over nearly 10 years to exploit the same bug. The first 3 produced an error message when the item duplication was unsuccessful. It was only unsuccessful ~10% of attempts, but I was careless enough to cause too many error messages to occur in a short period of time. I believe that&#x27;s why they were patched. However, the game devs didn&#x27;t investigate enough to realize my intent when causing those error messages. So they neither took action against my accounts for using the exploit (though my accounts were closed for exchanging items for real money), nor did they ever fix the underlying bug that allowed item duplication. They just fixed my methods for exploiting the bug. Then, I&#x27;d find a new method and continue.<p>I made enough to pay off a car, credit card debt, student loans, build a small chunk of savings, make a small down payment on a house, and live free of financial stress for a few years.

There&#x27;s good support for huge numbers of simultaneous network connections, and no standard GUI support. Google needed something; C++ has too many memory problems and Python is too slow.<p>Facebook uses PHP for much of their server-side stuff.  They did a PHP compiler to make that tolerably fast.<p>Mozilla&#x27;s Rust has potential, but I&#x27;m not convinced they have the &quot;owning&quot; logic right.  Supposedly 10% of the code in Servo, their browser renderer, is &quot;unsafe&quot;.  That&#x27;s far too high.  They&#x27;ve had their first good big idea, but I think they&#x27;re one or two key concepts short of definitively solving the problem of memory safety without garbage collection.<p>Swift I don&#x27;t know about.<p>Interestingly, these are all hard-compiled languages.  Most of the &quot;flexibility&quot; of scripting languages has been removed.  It seems that the one scripting language feature programmers really wanted type inference for local variables. That&#x27;s a feature of Go, Swift, Rust, and PHP.  Even C++ has that now, with &quot;auto&quot;.  (Writing iterator type declarations in C++ FOR statements was a huge pain.)  It&#x27;s almost better if function parameters have hard types; you can look at the function definition and see what it wants.  Python and JavaScript leave you wondering &quot;what type is parameter 3 supposed to be, anyway?&quot;<p>There&#x27;s some syntactic convergence, too. Go, Rust, and Swift all use C-type brackets. Python indentation style control structure didn&#x27;t catch on.  We&#x27;re also converging on &quot;name: type&quot;, instead of C&#x27;s &quot;type name&quot; form.

So Lua allows the engine developers to properly restrict the users to only use libraries and language constructs that will respect the sync (it fails at this, but it&#x27;s a goal and Lua helps with that).<p>2) Code from peers.  Users develop code for other users - widgets that help on the user-interface and games for each other to play.  A sandboxed environment is a must.<p>3) Graceful failure.

8702128,comment,8698986,8700111,0,0,gjm11,,,"> How can you reconcile the opportunity cost to society [...]<p>There are two fine institutions that may help with this: taxation and charity. If you earn a lot of money, then you pay a lot of taxes and can afford to give a lot away.<p>Everyone likes to complain about taxation, but it&#x27;s what turns a free market full of individuals and corporations all (to a good first approximation) trying to maximize their own wealth into something that benefits everyone.<p>And the most effective charities seem to be able to save a life (or provide a kinda-equivalent amount of other benefits) for something in the vicinity of $2000. (Important cautionary note: all such figures are very rough and you shouldn&#x27;t trust them too much.)<p>So, suppose you have a choice between a quant-finance job of, let&#x27;s suppose, exactly zero social value, and a job in medicine that pays $50k/year less. And suppose you&#x27;d be equally happy in either aside from ethical concerns. Then by taking the quant-finance job and giving away all your extra earnings, you give your government (let&#x27;s say) an extra $20k/year to spend on schools and hospitals and police and roads -- and, unfortunately, various other things you might approve of less, so let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s the equivalent of $10k/year going to something obviously valuable like teaching, so you&#x27;re paying for about 20% of an elementary-school teacher. And you give an extra $30k to (I hope) very effective charities, so maybe you are saving 10 lives a year.<p>So it comes down to the question: is the medical job more beneficial to the world than 20% of an elementary-school teacher and 10 poor Africans&#x27; lives per year?<p>You might answer that either way, but at any rate I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s obvious that the answer is that the medical job is better.<p>(Some notes: I am not claiming that anyone who goes into finance in preference to another worse-paid job is <i>obliged</i> to give away all the extra money they earn. Only that doing so is <i>one option</i>, and that it might work out pretty well ethically speaking. It might be psychologically difficult to give away so much of one&#x27;s earnings. It might be harder to &quot;derive meaning and satisfaction&quot; from things as indirect as tax and charity, compared with deriving them from one&#x27;s actual work. It can be argued that quant-finance has positive social value, but I&#x27;d be skeptical of claims that it has <i>much</i>. I do not work in finance and never have, though being a mathematician it&#x27;s always possible that one day I might.)",1417732323

So any internally developed hardware or software business logic could face such a mandate.<p>Second, it only covers security functions of such items... It&#x27;s not clear that specific information, such as a private key, would be a security function.<p>Third, it has an explicit exemption for the CALEA, Which lets the government mandate how the telephone companies network architecture worked in order to make it easier to wiretap, which the FCC expanded to ISPs and VOIP providers.  Now, the FBI and other government entities have been pushing for all internet companies to fall under the CALEA or similar laws, so we can presume that the CALEA is not everything it could be.  Still we know that Verizon, which is a broadband ISP, was adding a unique key to HTTP communications.<p>Fourth, it fails to define surveillance, and it&#x27;s unclear if a broad capture of information which isn&#x27;t looked, or of metadata, would be consider surveillance under the law.  The law mentions physical search, but that still leaves electronic searches, as well as any form of seizures.<p>Fifth, it does nothing to prevent attempts to weaken protocols, systems, APIs, encryption standards, etc.  While it may prevent specific implementations of them from being forcibly weakened, it wouldn&#x27;t prevent a forcible or other weakening of the underlying standard, including attempts to manipulate and weaken them.",1417731405

I don&#x27;t mean that they don&#x27;t work (they usually do), or that they are too slow (they usually are, but this is explained by selection bias given the reasons I&#x27;m looking at them), but that there is little standardization even with a given package, and the &#x27;foundations&#x27; seem weak.<p>Variable names are a hodgepodge of unhelpful single letter abbreviations theSecondArgumentToTheFunction; functions alternate between camelCase, dots, and underscores; and any form of architecture seems at best an afterthought.  It seems like the base language encourages this, or at least does nothing to prevent it.  It&#x27;s commonplace to pick on Perl, but the overall quality of popular packages seems considerably lower on CRAN than CPAN.  Perhaps this is because Perl is so conscious of its reputation at this point that the remaining programmers take great pain to write clear code?<p>I feel like R is currently in the stage where Perl and PHP were as the internet was just when the internet started to explode.  The first-to-market CGI scripts and libraries, often written by domain expert non-programmers, became the default choices which the rest of the infrastructure was built on.   At some point, the weight became too great for the shoddy[1] construction, and most people moved on to languages with better attention to maintainability and foundational detail (Python, Ruby).<p>Those who remained with the language evolved it in similar directions, by replacing the earlier libraries with better designed ones and by setting a higher standard for community norms.  I&#x27;m not sure about PHP, but contrary to reputation, modern Perl is often a really clean and consistent language.\nJulia seems to be playing a parallel role for R, although the new-found strength of Python in the data analysis space complicates the analogy.<p>But I wonder:  is R undergoing (or about to undergo) a similar renaissance?  Are there already examples of &quot;Modern R&quot; out there to serve as templates for the future direction of the language?
