That said, I will probably never stop cringing at the use of PHP for any project. It&#x27;s a terrible tool in a huge number of ways, some of them fundamental. Yes, it&#x27;s a functional tool, but mostly it&#x27;s a competitively capable tool only because every other language/platform out there is also more or less equivalently terrible in some other way.",1417867159

> programmers. All other languages require a lot of setting up.<p>One thing that is often overlooked with PHP is the fact that the deployment process if extremely easy, even for novice programmers. Simply use FTP/SFTP/SCP/whatever to copy over your files to a server, reload your browser, done. It&#x27;s completely optimised for the scenario where you simply want to create a webpage.<p>Compare that to something like Python, which is very &#x27;novice-friendly&#x27; as well, but needs quite some steps before you have a working website deployed on a server.",1417867007

MailChimp) just because it was PHP.<p>However as far as professional development concerned, I&#x27;d be very concerned about being hobbled by sticking with PHP over the long term.<p>First, because it doesn&#x27;t have any strong ideas to explore as a language, it just cobbles together ideas from other languages in a very ad-hoc and half-baked manner.  If you want to learn the power of first-class functions with closures for instance, those things <i>exist</i> in PHP, but the syntax is so baroque that you&#x27;d be excused for thinking they&#x27;re not worth the trouble.<p>This effect is compounded by the fact that the PHP community is an archipelago of experts in a sea of beginners.  If you&#x27;re a newbie coming in it&#x27;s relatively hard to figure out who to listen to to advance your skills.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s the external signaling aspect.  Although it&#x27;s unfair, the hard truth is that software developer talent is the classic market for lemons.  Most people evaluating you will not have the knowledge and experience to evaluate your skills objectively (heck, I&#x27;m a hiring tech lead and even I can&#x27;t <i>really</i> tell until I actually start working with someone).  For a lot of people, the language you use is the signal they use, and in this regard PHP is at the bottom of the food chain just about HTML/CSS.",1417866944

    <tab>Alpha</tab>
    <tab>Bravo</tab>
    <tab>Charlie</tab>
  </tab>
</code></pre>
and some JavaScript library (&quot;a new type of library for the Web&quot;) that processes these custom tags to display tabs on a web page.<p>I&#x27;m talking about pattern matching for templating rules; e.g. I want to handle a &quot;value&quot; token differently depending on whether the parent is a &quot;field&quot; or a &quot;value-list&quot; With XSLT I do this with a pattern: &quot;field/value&quot; vs &quot;value-list/value&quot;. It&#x27;s very clear and very efficient behind the scenes (about as speedy as a regex). I&#x27;m not sure I can do it in Python as easily.<p>As for parsers: parsers are a good thing, certainly, but look at what they do: they take an unstructured sequence of symbols and try to recover the hidden structure of it using a set of grammar rules. The end result is a tree that still contains the original sequence but dissects it into a hierarchy of discovered non-terminals.<p>Doesn&#x27;t this look familiar? It&#x27;s an XML document. XML documents are basically preparsed sequences or serialized parse trees. Maybe they have been parsed already by a specialized parser; or maybe the structure was added there manually when we marked up a text in a natural language; or maybe the sequence was generated by a machine in the first place and we just retained the original structure. What XML does is that it saves the result so there&#x27;s no need to parse the same sequence again.<p>(Well, there is; we still need to deserialize the XML document and to interpret certain sequences as strings and another as numbers or dates and this is also parsing; but the serialization notation is much simpler than the grammars that were involved to parse or build the original tree.)<p>This is why <i>parsing</i> HTML is a waste of time regardless of whether we do this with regular expressions, recursive descent, Earley, LALR, Tomita, PEG, or whatever parsing technology we like :) It has been parsed already; we only need to deserialize it, and this is a trivial task that has been solved long time ago. (Well, maybe not with HTML, because somehow it&#x27;s important to accept broken HTML and this may require a full-fledged parser and then some.)",1417863912
