Since this has been peer reviewed by ESA, I&#x27;m trusting these numbers. The ascend profile of these machines will look quite a bit different than rockets, so it&#x27;s hard to compare the efficiencies, but the &#x27;rocket starting at mach 5 horicontal velocity and out of atmosphere&#x27; comparison seems to be a good intuition to me, although we still have to reduce it by the amount of fuel that has been used in order to get to that point (which will not be insignificant, even though it&#x27;s 7.7 lower). We also shouldn&#x27;t forget that the hybrid system has a thrust-to-weight ratio of 14 compared to 150 of SpaceX&#x27; merlin engine, which means that it will take longer for such a system to reach the same speeds, reducing its efficiency gains. The reduced weight of the whole orbiter will make up some of that though, so unless we get more publicised informations on the whole ascend path along with simulated data it&#x27;s hard to tell. All I know is: When using the simplified versions in KSP these hybrid engines make a lot of sense, i.e. it&#x27;s the easiest way of getting an SSTO there ;-).<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_(rocket_engine)</a>",1418629573

But one thing I don&#x27;t like - types (static typing) for the implementation language is an afterthought in your books. This happened to PLAI, and later it switched to &quot;plai-typed&quot; language (which was a good move). Now we have PAPL, but again using a dynamic language. Although, as I can see, static typing is a planned feature for Pyret. So I suppose PAPL will switch to static typing in the future, but I think it would be better (for readers/learners, novice programmers) to <i>start</i> with (static) types in the first place.<p>EDIT: just skimmed through the text, you seem to be using &quot;type-like annotations&quot; mentioned in Pyret docs.<p>Another thing to note - Pyret is <i>much</i> more readable/enjoyable (and I guess writable :)) than the previous lisp languages you&#x27;ve used.

8751019,comment,8747550,8750754,0,0,pandaman,,,"It makes sense in the movies to hire a crew of contractors just for the shooting because shooting takes few weeks, months tops. A game production can take anywhere from a year to several years, contractors usually don&#x27;t want to commit for such long terms so it will take a while just to staff your project. Then, as you have shipped, you let go all your contractors and immediately start hiring new ones for the next slated project? Makes very little sense.<p>The churn you are seeing now is the effect of the poor financial state of the industry. A lot of studios are spending more money to make the games than the games bring back. Such studios eventually have to get out of business either through bankruptcy or through being shuttered by its holding company.<p>As a studio is nearing the inevitable end people employed there are leaving and the studio starts hiring, sometimes this is amplified by the management trying to &quot;fix&quot; the expensive production problem by expanding. Since the stable and profitable studios do not hire much, especially among people without industry experience, most of the new hires go into the studios that are already circling the drain and will be laid off in a year if not a month. This is what&#x27;s creating the impression of the high churn IMO.",1418629180
