7718257,comment,7717742,7717956,2,0,larrys,,,"I&#x27;m a fair bit older than you are and remember thinking when the internet came about that I had lost a big advantage over other people since I was someone that was always really good at self teaching and figuring out how to do things given the lack of information out there.  (Exactly what you said above basically).<p>When you were barely in pre-school I learned on my own how to fly a gas style rc helicopter (a 60 size which is big) back when if you crashed it you had to rebuild it. And you did crash it. Now I have an electric heli that I can fly in my outer office and it can crash into the wall and not even get damaged. [1][2] The ability to learn like that is amazing. It&#x27;s almost to easy. The gas heli would chew itself up when it crashed. It was also very expensive (about $2,000 in 80&#x27;s dollars).<p>Anyway my fear of losing an advantage was not really correct. Things did change. But today the game seems to be &quot;to much information&quot; and deciding what to learn and what opportunities to take advantage of both business and mental.<p>I won&#x27;t even get into how dating has changed since prior to the internet.<p>[1]  (Not to mention all the how to videos on the entire subject in addition to electric (didn&#x27;t exist back then) and greatly falling prices).<p>[2] Add: And of course all the gyros and electronics that today practically fly the craft themselves didn&#x27;t exist. I did have one gyro for the tail but you typically self corrected that with the stick anyway on takeoff.",1399589975

7718251,comment,7717093,7717093,5,0,Dn_Ab,,,"Analogies are lossy but one way to think of corecursion/recursion is that corecursion turns the seed into a maple tree and recursion eats the tree&#x27;s branches and spits out a table leg or something. Corecursion is generative and (structural) recursion aggregates/builds. You corecursively generate a possibly infinite stream while you recursively turn a finite list of numbers into their sum.<p>Other places you&#x27;ve probably already seen corecursiveness: Power Series in calculus, automatons in computer science and in the close cousin that is the so called map in MapReduce TM.<p>Programming with just (primitive but on higher order functions) recursion and corecursion is the basis of Total Functional Programming which, while not Turing complete is still very surprisingly powerful.",1399589845

A typical MacWinuX desktop setup is already over 200 Millions lines of code.  I&#x27;d be happy to drop that to a dozen million lines instead (even though 20K are probably closer to the mark <a href=""http://vpri.org/html/work/ifnct.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vpri.org/html/work/ifnct.htm</a>).  It also shouldn&#x27;t be much slower than current native applications.<p>Heck, it may even be significantly <i>faster</i>.  Without native code, hardware doesn&#x27;t have to care about backward compatibility any more!  Just patch the suitable GCC or LLVM back end, and recompile the brO-Ser.  New processors will be able to have better instruction sets, be tuned for JIT compilation…  The Mill CPU architecture for instance, with its low costs for branch mispredictions, already looks like nice target for interpreters.<p>---<p>> <i>I do think it&#x27;s worth considering the security price we are paying to make things like PDF.js possible.</i><p>Remember the 200 million lines I mentioned above?  We&#x27;re <i>already</i> paying that security price.  For a long time, actually.<p>---<p>That said, I agree with your main point: the whole thing sucks big time, and it would be real nice if we could just start over, and have a decent full featured system that fit in, say 50.000 lines or so.  Of course, that means forgoing backward compatibility, planning for many cores right away…  Basically going back to the 60s, with hindsight.<p>Alas, as Richard P. Gabriel taught us, it&#x27;ll never happen.",1399589610

Gnome 3 and Unity were to a great extent <i>forced</i> upon their users. If there were real benefits to means of desktop interaction that differed significantly from the established &quot;Windows 95&quot; and &quot;tiling WM&quot; modes, you&#x27;d think there&#x27;d be a few enthusiasts on the side exploring this realm and touting its productivity advantages.<p>I&#x27;d bet the majority of the lightweight &quot;Windows 95 clone&quot; WMs and DEs exist because GNOME and (to a lesser extent) KDE alienated their userbases by trying to be &quot;different&quot; and &quot;next generation&quot; (mostly by poorly cloning OSX and the latest Windows version that nobody liked anyway), so I&#x27;d hesitate to say that experimentation should be left to them.<p>EDIT: Many commercial products suffer from this problem where the existing version is &quot;good enough&quot; and people are happy using it for several hours a day, but the producer needs to convince users to purchase the new version anyway, so they end up adding a lot of pointless, irritating, and even product-breaking changes just to make the new version seem revolutionary and worthy of an upgrade, even if it&#x27;s actually making the product worse. Many open source devs don&#x27;t seem to have realized that there is no reason for them to play this game. They don&#x27;t need to sell anyone a new version in a cardboard box, so there&#x27;s no conflict of interest here; they can do less work and make their users more happy by keeping things stable and incrementally improving things.

Each customer has a `session` with the device. During the session, the `customer` may make various types of `payments` (coin or credit card) for various types of `fees`. Additionally, the customer may receive one or more `tickets`. The data model is getting pretty big with:<p>* Devices<p>* Sessions<p>* Line Items<p>* Allocations<p>* Payments<p>* Adjustments<p>* Violations<p>* Fees<p>For accounting purposes, we need to be able to map our payments to the fees and violations they are paying for. Customers might make a single payment to cover multiple violations and those violations may be across multiple sessions.<p>The number of times I&#x27;ve heard &quot;this new solution fixes X but breaks π&quot; is frustrating, but I don&#x27;t see how this could be separated out. Perhaps others have insights that would simplify all of this, but it seems to me that the essential fact of our system is that the payment/line item/allocation system is responsible for many tasks/reports.

Like most people here, I work in software these days, but during the generalist part of the program I took everything from thermodynamics, to civil engineering, to quantum mechanics, to fluid dynamics, to vector calculus, to molecular biology, to electromagnetics, to material science, to statistics, to electrical circuits, to... you get the picture.<p>I was not prepared for this in the least.<p>A lot of people asked me, &quot;If you already know you have an interest in computers, why are you putting yourself through this instead of going through a standard computer science or computer engineering degree?&quot; It was a question I asked myself very often as well, to the point where I was at one point strongly considering switching out. But I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t, because looking back on it, the biggest thing I got out of it was not the broad scientific background—I can barely remember much of the stuff from the more esoteric courses I took—but the knowledge that I <i>could</i>, in fact, learn these kinds of things in a relatively quick timeframe. That these things were not eternal mysteries, not the exclusive domain of &quot;experts&quot;, and that I could, given enough effort, understand them, at least decently enough to do my assignments and pass the course.<p>I tried to keep this lesson in mind moving forward, and still try to keep it today. In my last year, I signed up for a course on compilers, not because I wanted to work on compilers but because I wanted to <i>demystify</i> one of the last things that still seemed mysterious in my day-to-day computer work. Once I started working for a living, I read up on some basic personal finance so I could manage my money properly. Last year, I was unsatisfied with the design of my personal website, so I learned some basic color theory and typography and redesigned it myself. These days, I&#x27;ve been learning Chinese[0]—something most westerners balk at doing—out of personal interest, and the feeling of walking down a street in Chinatown and suddenly realizing, <i>&quot;Hey, I can make out a bit of what&#x27;s written on the signs now, whereas a few weeks ago it was all incomprehensible hieroglyphics&quot;</i> is incredibly liberating.<p>So this post resonates with me pretty deeply. It&#x27;s just wood. You shouldn&#x27;t believe that these things are beyond your grasp, because if you do it&#x27;ll become a self-fulfilling prophecy. This spirit of lifelong learning is something I hope never leaves me. The day I stop learning will be the day I die.<p>[0] As mentioned earlier here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7623418"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7623418</a>",1399587880

7718070,comment,7717961,7717961,4,0,mantrax5,,,"Unpaywalled (there&#x27;s honestly nothing interesting, so I feel ok posting this, 99% filler):<p>Apple is closing in on its largest ever acquisition with the planned $3.2bn purchase of Beats Electronics, the headphone maker and music streaming operator founded by music producer Jimmy Iovine and the hip-hop star Dr Dre.\nThe deal could be announced as early as next week, people familiar with the negotiations said, but they cautioned that some details had yet to be agreed and talks could still fall apart.<p>A deal on the scale being discussed would represent a radical departure for Tim Cook, chief executive of the iPhone maker: under the late Steve Jobs, Apple was reluctant to pursue high-profile acquisitions.\nApple will acquire Beats’ streaming music service, which launched this year, and its audio equipment business, which includes its brand of headphones and audio equipment. The Beats management team will report to Mr Cook, said people familiar with the deal. Apple and Beats declined to comment.<p>A decade after Mr Jobs transformed the music industry with the iTunes download store and the iPod digital music player, the deal is likely to be seen as an admission that Apple needs to look outside its Cupertino labs to continue making an impact.\nWhile Beats commands a leading position in the premium headphone market, its real value to Apple is in revitalising its “cool” at a time when iTunes has waned in popularity and Samsung’s marketing campaigns have savaged the iPhone’s brand.\nApple executives have admitted that its brand is in need of a revamp. Internal emails released during its recent patent trial with Samsung showed that its marketing chief Phil Schiller considered changing Apple’s ad agency after the success of its Korean rival’s “next big thing” campaign.<p>Apple is paying a hefty premium for cool: Beats took a $500m investment from Carlyle in September 2013 that valued the company at more than $1bn. “In terms of acquisitions, Apple has been very, very light in their activity,” said Richard Lane, analyst at Moody’s. “I don’t think they’ve spent $1bn in any of the last four years.”<p>Mr Cook said last month Apple was “on the prowl” for more acquisitions, after buying 24 companies in the past 18 months and he was not averse to large acquisitions.<p>The Beats move follows a string of high-priced deals in Silicon Valley, after Google acquired smart home developer Nest Labs for $3.2bn and Facebook offered an initial $19bn for WhatsApp Messenger.<p>One motivation for the Beats deal may lie in shifts in music consumption. Subscription services are the biggest growth area for the music industry, with revenues increasing 50 per cent to $1.1bn in 2013, according to a recent report by the IFPI, the global music industry association.<p>But downloads fell 2 per cent to $3.93bn – the first annual decline since Apple launched its iTunes store in 2003. iTunes is still the world’s largest music download service.<p>Apple has dabbled in music streaming but never launched an unlimited subscription service to compete with fast-growing rivals to iTunes such as Spotify.<p>In 2009 it acquired Lala, a music streaming service, and last year launched iTunes Radio, which competes with elements of Beats, as well as more established players such as Pandora.<p>Mr Iovine and Dr Dre – real name Andre Young – were inspired to create Beats by the poor sound quality of the headphones bundled with the iPod and iPhone. Beloved by music and sports stars Beats has become a street-smart fashion brand\nAhead of Apple’s expected launch of an ‘iWatch’ accessory, Beats will also give its designers and engineers access to years of experience in what some see as the original “wearable technology”.<p>Nonetheless, the pricey deal is likely to raise questions about Apple’s internal capability to innovate after the death of Mr Jobs in 2011.<p>At the end of March, Apple’s global cash pile stood at $133bn, net of the $17bn in debt it raised last year. Since then it has raised a further $12bn, which it said at the time was to help fund its $130bn dividend and share buyback programme. However, most of its funds are held overseas and its domestic cash has fallen by $16bn to $18bn since it resumed paying dividends in 2012.",1399587660

Or they have but those messages are no longer on the device because they have been deleted. Or Bob just bought a new device.<p>A variation of the idea is using the contact name. It&#x27;s more reasonable to expect the sender to know the name and address of the recipient, but that has problems too: It would require the sender know the exact spelling of the recipients name (eg. Robert? Bob? Rob?) Also, while hash(name + address) is harder to crack than hash(address) it&#x27;s not that hard for anyone who knows the value of address. The server knows this, so the server operator would be in a position to figure out names for nearly everyone. The server would also function as an oracle for anyone who knows a number and suspects a name, or knows a name and wants to scan for the number. That&#x27;s even worse than allowing for enumeration of registered addresses.<p>Does that make sense or am I missing something?",1399586926

7718011,comment,7716430,7716761,8,0,anigbrowl,,,"That&#x27;s because you&#x27;ve never dealt with a conventional film distributor. Netflix pays monthly (last time I checked) and supplies producers with useful analytics. Indie (and some major) film production companies <i>love</i> dealing with Netflix because they&#x27;re transparent and reliable, whereas film distributors traditionally make used car salesmen look like models of fiscal probity.<p>Also, film companies themselves aren&#x27;t inclined to go vertical; there was a time when studios owned chains of theaters but antitrust litigation brought that to a painful end (<i>United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc., 334 US 131</i>), so the industry sense is that self-distribution is too risky legally, and setting up their own independent competitor looks dangerously close to cartel behavior. Film economics are so brutal to begin with that litigation over anything other than well-defined copyright cases does not sit well with investors. Also, nobody wants to sink all the time can capital into building a CDN; being a technologist is a career-limiting move in Hollywood because the power revolves around the ability to bring stars, stories, investors and distributors together, so it&#x27;s very much people-driven.<p>Of course film production involves a great deal of technology but if your specialty is in a technical role then you&#x27;re considered a craftsman, not an artist. The thing is, the film product doesn&#x27;t depend on technology for success; of course you&#x27;ll want to use it for an action or superhero movie, but great movies can also be very simple, technically. Case in point: Joss Whedon directed <i>The Avengers</i> in 2011, but took two weeks off during post-production to shoot an (outstanding) adaptation of <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> at his home. He used digital cameras to save time and cash, but it could just as easily have been shot on film and edited on a moviola.",1399586907
