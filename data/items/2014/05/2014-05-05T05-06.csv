Hell, with CASE tools we wouldn&#x27;t even need programmers anymore, folks will just enter the requirements and compilable code will come out the other end!<p>The world of computing machinery was rife with that bullshit around that time, more so than before because most folks had never used a computer to do something useful and up to that time computers were mostly ginormous calculators or data sorters.

Object-oriented programming eventually found its place in the world, but I think it, too, was largely oversold in the late 80s and early 90s.<p>So then we were left in an in-between time where we were beginning to discover the magic that computers can work, but had not yet developed the necessary level of skepticism needed to sniff out the snake oil.<p>The article in one sense lays the blame at the feet of old-school Big Bang development.

In terms of games, as just one example, the difference between the &#x27;80s and today is extreme. There&#x27;s more coding and graphics work in just a tiny little throwaway piece of a world in modern games than there were in many &#x27;80s games.<p>Also, the level of bugs that are tolerable if you have no method for patching are different than if you do. Super Mario World, for example, has a number of bugs that are now quite well known, but those bugs are in general small enough to not warrant recalling the product so we still tend to think of the game as &quot;perfect&quot;.",1399266758

A week ago all of my sites suddenly went down. I had a couple personal sites, a family business website, a friends cooking blog that I manage, etc. Upon calling them, they informed me that my account had &quot;malicious files&quot; on it and was disabled, but it was okay because &quot;they emailed me that morning&quot;. They would re-enable it immediately if I subscribe for &quot;SiteLock&quot;.<p>Turns out that I had an old wordpress installation in a sub-sub-directory that got compromised (had some shell script injected in it.) So, they disabled my account and told me I could pay them to enable SiteLock and they would bring it back up, OR I could handle it myself and email them when I was done and they would re-enable my account in 24-48 hours. Upon request for information on what SiteLock is, I got &quot;there are bad people out there trying to get your information, and it stops them&quot;.<p>I know shared hosts are inherently bad, but I don&#x27;t really feel like managing my own LAMP, ftp, smtp, domain routing, etc, so I&#x27;ve held on to my Netfirms account for 10 years for simple websites.

Witness the code sample in my other comment on this article:  In the initial version, we have to break out of the declarative model and drop down to an iterative one.  Practically speaking that means D3 invokes the first `each` handler, the first line of which is go back to D3 to recreate the selection we just lost.  Likewise, using `each` instead of `call` for the animation tween requires an invocation of the tweening function for every element in the data.<p>One of my favorite parts about D3 is that the cleanest looking code is almost always the most efficient.",1399266376
