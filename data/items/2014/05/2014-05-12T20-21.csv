Unicode (ie. the standard set forth by the unicode consortium) has nothing to say about encoding.<p>I think what you mean is &quot;Go&#x27;s &#x27;everything is a UTF-8 string&#x27; approach&quot;, but I&#x27;m not familiar enough with Go&#x27;s internal encoding to know.<p>For instance, you mention &quot;Don&#x27;t handle the decode errors&quot;, but I can only assume by that you mean UTF-8&#x27;s decode errors, since UTF-8 has the possibility of <i>having</i> encoding errors, where things like UTF-32 do not.  They&#x27;re both Unicode encodings, so it makes no sense to say it&#x27;s &quot;Unicode&quot;&#x27;s decode errors.<p>I think the author of this article falls into the same trap all over the place.  He uses the word &quot;Unicode&quot; to refer to an encoding all over the place.  Until he is able to distinguish the difference between the Unicode standard and all its various encoding methods, there&#x27;s not much point in reading his article.<p>(And no, Microsoft&#x27;s braindead decision to use the word &quot;Unicode&quot; to mean &quot;UCS-2&quot;, and later ret-conning it to mean &quot;UTF-16&quot;, doesn&#x27;t count.

7735354,comment,7731624,7735274,2,0,steveklabnik,,,"I was actually physically in attendance when McPhereson presented this paper, long ago. Well, at least, she presented it at my university, I don&#x27;t think it was the first time she revealed it or anything. I also own a copy of this book somewhere...<p>My take at the time was that McPherson wasn&#x27;t making a causal or even correlative claim: just showing that this similar social structure appeared at the same time in two completely distinct situations. Nothing more than that. Which ends up being _interesting_, but not something that you can directly _use_ in any day-to-day way. That said, I do think the &#x27;modular form&#x27; makes a lot of sense, and it has impacted some of my thinking. For a recent variant of this, you may enjoy Galloway&#x27;s criticism of the OOO people. He draws a sort of similar conceptual schema with regards to {Ford,Taylor}ism&#x27;s modularity and OOP, as well as the anti-humanism of OOO.<p>Then again, re-reading just now:<p>> In short, I suggest that these two moments are deeply interdependent.<p>Sooooo maybe that assessment was off. I&#x27;ll have to give this another read. I guess I&#x27;m currently in agreement with your &#x27;summary&#x27; link.<p>> My take is her sourcing of Eric S. Raymond and his writings to be really interesting.<p>Yeah. I mean, it&#x27;s the logical place to go. And if you want to talk about the intersection of programming and race, well, esr is one of the more embarrassing sources you can pull up. She didn&#x27;t touch on any of that, though, which I was pretty surprised about.<p>> I&#x27;d be highly interested for a socio-literary critical analysis of code<p>I&#x27;ll take only the first half of this sentence to plug my own project: set up an email reminder to check out <a href=""http://metaphysics.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://metaphysics.io</a>, which I recently purchased for this express purpose. I&#x27;m still working out exactly what the project is, but I have four initial essays that I&#x27;ve drafted up so far. I think I&#x27;m going to release them as &quot;issues&quot;, rather than one at a time like blog posts. Three of them are explicitly computer science related and one is not. The first issue deals mostly with affect theory, because I&#x27;ve been enamored with it lately.<p>You may want to check out what Kevin Brock has been doing lately around the intersection of rhetoric and code. There are other people who touch on this from time to time too, one of the most recent: <a href=""https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2014/tdd-straw-men-and-rhetoric"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/blog/2014/tdd-straw-men-a...</a><p>> whether the debate/adoption of new frameworks/languages/paradigms (Go, Ember.js, Rust, Responsive Design) is a new form of elitism and/or marketing for software developers as a consumer class.<p>This idea is super interesting. I want to describe it as much more... cynical than what I think, but it may in fact be true.<p>> Also the shift from centralized servers to a more distributed programming model mirror the fragmentary nature, autonomous organizing of modern living<p>I will most certainly be writing some thoughts about this in the future. I almost can see a parallel to McPhereson: two modes of organization, springing up in the same time and place.",1399928062

I&#x27;d prefer one dimension and not two, and the data of one dimension normalized to one speed being 1. Ignoring the tables, I interpret the graph to show that signatures are almost 30% slower than the old method? Old method almost 4M per sec, signatures 3M per sec. So signatures are cleaner to write, but it would be much more inviting if there wouldn&#x27;t be a penalty paid. I understand that they wanted to add extra checking, but I&#x27;d prefer that the extra checking is only compile-time by default.<p>IMO the default of features should be a net win. Otherwise everybody&#x27;s favorite performance tip is going to be &quot;don&#x27;t use that feature.&quot;<p>My approach would be: the signatures by default are just an alternative syntax to<p><pre><code>    sub f {\n       my ( $a, $b, $c ) = @_;\n</code></pre>\nand the new checks are only compile-time, and the new run-time checks are activated by switch or &quot;use.&quot; Then nobody would have any reason to keep writing old style except when needed to run on older versions.",1399927857

Or something similar to that. And then customers expect you to magically read their minds anyway.<p>Why do I say this? One day at my restaurant I watched someone ask for &quot;extra mayo&quot; and I watched the cook put double the usual amount on there, which is customary for &quot;extra x&quot; orders. Customer then took the burger apart and said &quot;that&#x27;s not enough&quot;. Cook then doubled the mayo that&#x27;s already on there. At this point keep in mind that the burger is coated in mayo and will be dripping it while he&#x27;s eating - hell, it&#x27;s already oozing mayo everywhere and it&#x27;s quite gross to look at. She started using spoons to pile it on (also because it was already served so we can&#x27;t use our regular utensils to put more mayo on there). He then started screaming obscenities about how my cook is such a cheapass and she&#x27;s terrible at her job because who the fuck calls his burger &quot;extra mayo&quot; because he wants EVEN MORE MAYO on there. At this point I was shocked for a second but my brain finally kicked in fast enough to tell him to apologize and leave or else I&#x27;m calling the police before he might do something stupid like throwing food. He left his burger behind and I had the great pleasure of letting the cook throw it out. Really, you want even more mayo than that you tell people how much mayo you want in the first place. Or bring your own, because there was more mayo than meat on the burger - not kidding.<p>Then there&#x27;s the winner of the month the other day where a customer spent _forever_ asking for the price of a food and then the same food without fries, and then ordered the food without fries because she couldn&#x27;t afford like the $1 extra for fries and dug around in her purse to even pay for the food by itself. She called back two days later saying &quot;so I ordered x with fries and i got the food without fries on x day at x time, can i get a refund, it was x cashier and she screwed up&quot; - lady, for one you were the only person that ordered that in the couple hours around the time you gave us and we see it on the POS, if you had a problem you should have brought it up before you even dug in, we also STILL remember what you did because not many customers dig around and upturn their purse on the counter to pay for a $3 item, and lastly there is no way in hell I&#x27;m believing a random stranger like that before my own employees that I trust to tell me the truth because I don&#x27;t punish them for most small mistakes like that.<p>So yeah. The customer is ...<i>snark</i> always....<i>snark</i> <i>snort</i> right.<p>BTW when I first took over said restaurant, Square Register actually didn&#x27;t even support modifiers and didn&#x27;t for a while after that - and it&#x27;s still meh compared to other iPad systems on the market. Lots of competition and mediocre apps makes me want to do something in this industry (and how many developers actually can say they have experience with restaurants?) and then I stop caring because it&#x27;s &quot;good enough&quot;..maybe I should just go work for one of these companies.",1399926222

Put the ZIP data in a data URL, set the href attribute of the link to the data URL, and set the download attribute to &quot;yourcoolfilename.zip&quot; (or whatever you want). Boom. Done. User clicks the link, data downloads to &quot;yourcoolfilename.zip&quot;. Totally streamlined.<p>Not in Safari. The best you can do there is open up the data URL in a new window (which of course ignores any mime type you&#x27;ve set, so the user gets an ugly screen full of binary data) and tell them to use Save As to save the mess.
