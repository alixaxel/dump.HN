The future is pretty irrelevant</i><p>I&#x27;d disagree with this.  The future of your codebase matters unless you&#x27;re writing a throwaway prototype.  And when you rewrite a codebase N times, you&#x27;ll discover that there are ways of structuring it so that future tasks will become far easier.  E.g. for Lisp you&#x27;d refactor common patterns into utility functions, and for C you&#x27;d carefully craft the interfaces between modules so that they&#x27;re unlikely to be used improperly / unlikely to be surprising.",1399413025

You advertise it through targeted display (cheap if managed well) plus PR. You then build marketing material around your buzzword. Search volume starts building around your buzzword. You satisfy those search queries and convert the people that you have pre-qualified with your own &#x27;open sesame&#x27; magic combination of words into customers.<p>This is also why a bunch of different companies will often collaborate on pumping one buzzword (&#x27;cloud computing&#x27; / &#x27;the internet of things&#x27;): it makes it more affordable for all the companies involved to market a new major development that will take years to build out.<p>There you go.<p>Also, somehow Amazon clobbered a big river in South America for differentiation and recognition, so this isn&#x27;t really that huge of a problem if the service is itself compelling and differentiated enough from the competitors. Barnes & Noble is a completely unique term, for example. &#x27;Borders,&#x27; not entirely unique, but still more unique than Amazon.<p>Also if advertising the website via audio/video is a big deal, you can always just make an easy to remember alternate site with your call to action and just redirect them to your real site. Domain exact match is not nearly as important now as it used to be for ranking on Google, and it&#x27;s possible that domains will become more obscured to users than they are today in the future.",1399413019

I know for certain Triple Town [1] has basically the same gameplay (except you drop instead of swipe, some extra cutesy elements) and is from 2011, and I highly doubt it originated the concept or gameplay.  To use their example, I feel like Asher Vollmer and Greg Wohlwend created Dr. Mario and not Tetris, and were shocked when people started playing other Tetris knockoffs.  I understand being frustrated that someone else hit success with the same idea and different execution, but I don&#x27;t get the &quot;my copy is novel&quot; attitude.  Feels like a 1 click buy patent.<p>[1] <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spryfox.tripletown"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spryfox.tr...</a>",1399411109

True. But I&#x27;ve been using Emacs since 1979 or so, and it just seems <i>much worse</i> in the last ten years.",1399410089

However, there is no reason for bank customers to even have accounts on the mainframe. Bank customer accounts have nothing to do with mainframe user accounts.<p>There is no good reason for any mainframe password restrictions to leak into the public facing web front end. To the mainframe, the web password should just be a data field in a database [1], and mainframe databases can easily handle data fields of sufficient length to support modern password best practices.<p>[1] Or rather, the output of hashing (with something like bcrypt or better) is just a data field in a database.",1399410066
