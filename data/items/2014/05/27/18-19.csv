I mean look at how we even define &#x27;searching the internet&#x27; in our spoken language: &#x27;google it&#x27;.  Google has become the identity of search on the web in most people&#x27;s minds.  And to top it off, they are really, really good at it.  Google getting better is going to widen the gap between them and everyone else, but the gap is already pretty damn wide.  Was there really any chance of someone catching them in any foreseeable future?<p>But, the wider that gap gets the more motivation there becomes to <i>not</i> attack the gap, but to go in a different direction altogether.  Nobody talks about duckduckgo because they&#x27;re search results are better than google&#x27;s, they talk about them because duckduckgo is all about your privacy.  They found a different way to make a search that people want to use.  The wider that gap gets the more motivated some will be to try something truly novel to compete with google.",1401217174

Talking about average this-or-that gives you almost no insight about the real state of affairs.  Both sentences might be true, but not useful.<p>The YC homepage does a pretty good job of showing off the incredible value you get by being a YC founder.  Trying to quantize that value into dollars might not be a good idea.<p>EDIT:  To expand a little more, YC has to be an incredible value.  They must offer so much more value than a traditional employer in order to get most people seriously considering whether to do it.  YC&#x27;s biggest competitor is the cushy office job.  &quot;The office job&quot; is undoubtedly responsible for removing the vast majority of potential YC applicants, so YC must continue to be a way better deal.  I suspect YC&#x27;s second biggest competitor is the lover.  Falling in love is pretty common, and you tend to lose perspective about the rest of your life in comparison to what you have now.<p>So, it&#x27;s really as simple as that: Being a part of YC is valuable because it has to be.",1401217100

7806144,comment,7799524,7805793,1,0,chromatic,,,"<i>I think at one point, prior to MoarVM being announced, there was still a chance Parrot could have been &quot;saved&quot;.</i><p>The deprecation policy was a point of contention, sure. It was poorly implemented in practice--but it was as much to <i>help</i> Rakudo as it was to reduce the amount of churn in Parrot. Rakudo probably would have had less trouble with it if Rakudo had less code which poked into the internals of Parrot. That&#x27;s half the fault of Parrot, which had poor design of certain pieces, as well as Rakudo, which rejected a lot of offers to pull some or most of that code into Parrot. (That&#x27;s a theme.)<p>I personally spent most of my time on Parrot doing things to improve it <i>for</i> Rakudo--fixing a lot of unpleasant bugs, both in Parrot and Rakudo, for example as well as improving performance. I and other Parrot developers asked multiple times for a list of issues Rakudo wanted Parrot to address. Occasionally we&#x27;d get a list and work on them--but I also volunteered to focus on specific improvements for Rakudo and was told &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Not yet&quot; multiple times. You can see that too, if you look in the IRC logs--and not just for things <i>I</i> wanted to do. Andrew Whitworth, in particular, spent months or years on tenterhooks, volunteering to implement the object system called \n&quot;sixmodel&quot; in Parrot, but he was always told that it wasn&#x27;t fully designed yet or it wasn&#x27;t mature enough. Eventually he left the project too.<p>On one side, I took a lot of criticism from Rakudo developers for not pushing Parrot harder to be what they wanted and on the other side, I took a lot of criticism from Rakudo developers for trying to change Parrot to be what they wanted. In the face of that seeming contradiction, it seemed obvious to me that they&#x27;d already decided to write and maintain a new backend VM from scratch.<p>My priority--getting a usable P6 release out and stable for general purposes--was clearly incompatible with that decision. Rakudo Star was supposed to come out as a &quot;useful and usable&quot; distribution for early adopters over four years ago, and to my knowledge, it&#x27;s still only nominally useful and usable for very few purposes.<p><i>That</i> is one of my most substantive criticisms of the whole process. Rakudo and P6 have a long history of claiming to be about eighteen months away from general usability, but the project&#x27;s history is littered with rewrites, questionable technical decisions, and many, many good people leaving in frustration--sometimes quiet and sometimes not.<p>I begrudge no one working on it, but I believe it&#x27;s on a path to ever less relevance without a dramatic change in project management. I&#x27;ll reluctantly take the blame for mistakes <i>I</i> made as a member of the P6 design team and as a leader in Parrot, but I object to rewriting history to suggest that Parrot was solely at fault for Rakudo&#x27;s current state.",1401216766

The sales cycle can admittedly be long, but it&#x27;s not impossible.<p>You have to create a product that addresses pain points for business users. It has to be a compelling product and it has to solve problems for business decision makers. Initially, you want to sell to the business, not to the IT department. It turns out that spreadsheets are mainly used by business users and subject matter experts, instead of IT.<p>The next issue is price. If you are trying to sell something for (say) $1 million to a big corporation, then it is quite a a long sales cycle (but still achievable). My personal take on this is you do want to eventually be charging several million dollars per corporate client, but you also should have a low cost &quot;entry level&quot; version of the product. The cost has to be low enough that a business power user could charge it to his Corporate American Express without being noticed (say $1,000) and download and install your application (he will need admin rights, which he might in fact have).<p>> The world of finance and investment banking is a world of networking and extreme resistance to change.<p>Yes there is a lot of networking that goes on. This can really work in your favor, because there is a sort of herd mentality. Once people start talking to each other about your product, customers will want to talk to you. If you close a large deal, news will quickly spread and other large deals can follow.<p>I would not agree that there is &quot;extreme resistance to change.&quot; In my experience, banks, hedge funds, etc, are often early adopters and one of the largest users of high technology.<p>>  There&#x27;s a reason Bloomberg&#x27;s suite of products sits as pretty as it does<p>I have Bloomberg in my cross-hairs, next to Excel.<p>> and unless some great upheaval occurs  will continue to do so for many years<p>You are correct that change often requires a catalyst. But I think that great upheavals are happening everyday, but they are hidden behind closed doors, occurring deep inside of companies and departments. In my experience, it is precisely during those times of upheaval that you have the best chance of introducing a new, disruptive technology into an organization. There are many kinds of upheavals that happen. (mergers, divestitures, running into Excel&#x27;s maximum row limit, etc) and they can all be catalysts for change.<p>I&#x27;ve put my email address in profile now, thanks for the tip.",1401215975

This has been an area where python and ruby have been pretty common, but they&#x27;re both a complete pain in the ass to use that way (setting up virtualenv, setting up rvm, pip problems, gem/bundler problems, etc).<p>For eg. we use vagrant and fabric at my work for server management (vagrant+fabric for dev environments, fabric alone for production servers). One&#x27;s written in ruby and the other is written in python, and we have to spend a non-trivial amount of time managing their dependencies so they continue to install correctly.

7806051,comment,7803529,7804584,2,0,quotemstr,,,"Note that PEGs are <i>not</i> context-free grammars. They&#x27;re both more and less powerful than traditional CFGs, and they&#x27;re tricky to use: because PEG choice is <i>ordered</i> and traditional CFG choice is <i>unordered</i>, it&#x27;s hard to translate standard language grammars to a PEG recognizer system. That&#x27;s why, for my forever-project, I&#x27;ve oped to use scannerless GLR instead of PEGs. Both PEGs and GLR recognize languages that are closed under composition (the property that gives you extensibility), but the formalisms for GLR parsers are much better.<p>The Harmonia project is the best whack at the problem I&#x27;ve seen.

Doing that in a general way when using tools based on declarative grammars is, well, very hard, especially when you want to recover from brace mismatch problems. The best approach is &quot;island and reef parsing&quot;, where you actually parse your buffer twice: you first build a map of all the &quot;reefs&quot; (parenthesis) using a simple recursive descent parser, pair up mismatched parenthesis using an ad-hoc algorithm, insert corrections for mismatches, then apply your fully general parser to the result. (The word &quot;parenthesis&quot; here refers to any balanced construct, even &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot;. You can actually infer what the &quot;parenthesis&quot; for a given language are by examining the grammar!)<p>See also <a href=""http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/cs/Personal/Emma_Soderberg/docs/SLE08pres.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fileadmin.cs.lth.se/cs/Personal/Emma_Soderberg/docs/S...</a>",1401215756

The cheat sheet here:<p>Entrapment requires:<p>(1) a causal relationship between police action and the accused&#x27;s commission of a crime, and<p>(2) the police overcoming some demonstrable resistance to the commission of that crime, or the accused otherwise demonstrating that the police somehow corrupted them into committing a crime they would not have been predisposed to commit otherwise.<p>The &quot;entrapment myths&quot; in the comic:<p>1. That the police have to tell you that they&#x27;re cops, or are somehow not allowed to deceive you into committing a crime. (No).<p>2. That the police cannot ask you to commit a crime. (No).<p>3. That the police cannot break the law themselves to get themselves into a position to see you commit a crime. (No).<p>4. That the police cannot help you commit a crime. (No).<p>5. That the police cannot allow you to commit a crime or somehow give you the impression that your actions are lawful and then arrest you. (No).<p>The law expects you to actively resist an entreaty from anyone --- undercover cop, uniformed cop, friend, family member --- to knowingly break the law.<p>The example the comic gives of an unreasonable effort to break through resistance: appealing to a friend to aid in the commission of a crime because your life depends on it, putting  the accused in a position where a reasonable ordinary person might choose to participate in the crime as the lesser of two evils.

What isn&#x27;t stated is that capital accumulation is synonymous with reduction of democratic freedoms. What happens if we value a rise in living standards over a rise in democratic freedoms?

Sure software spreadsheets are basically just parroting the physical ledgers that came before them, but turning them into software almost immediately opened up a kind of dynamic that didn&#x27;t exist before. The latest Excel is basically just an organically evolved VisiCalc. There really hasn&#x27;t been a huge paradigm shift since then.<p>It&#x27;s not clear that there should be either, spreadsheets work really well. Efforts to move them into databases or whatever be damned. A spreadsheet is != to a database table except maybe in the most abstract possible sense in some cases. They really are different things and I agree that issues with spreadsheets should be solved by improving the tools not trying to paradigm shift spreadsheet users into an inappropriate environment that also happens to have a very long and highly skilled environment setup requirement.",1401213657
