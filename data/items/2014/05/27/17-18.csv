However, it&#x27;s getting overwhelming quickly.<p>I was wondering if anyone has a system or process for managing cold email or cold-call leads? Right now I basically have a massive Excel spreadsheet and am considering Boomerang for receipt/click management. I feel there has to be a more methodical and steady way to reach out to hundreds of leads while maintaining each thread & progress state properly.<p>In my particular case, I&#x27;m currently cold-emailing but depending on the larger scale results could switch to cold-call.",1401213578

I take a popular medication for high blood pressure control, lisinopril, which can interfere with potassium elimination by the kidneys so I have to be careful with it myself.  I haven&#x27;t needed to avoid potassium-rich foods which contain it naturally (periodic testing of potassium serum levels confirms this), but artificial supplementation with potassium chloride can be especially dangerous; V-8 vegetable juice is an excellent example:  it&#x27;s processed so heavily during production that nutrient are destroyed, so supplements are added, including enough potassium chloride to bring potassium levels to > 700mg in a 6 oz serving, so it&#x27;s best avoided.",1401213540

If you replace all your references to PAGE with URL, you get closer to a real meaning.<p>URLs for single-page applications are a serialization of application state. The fact that we now have an application platform (JavaScript/HTTP) providing sharable, mostly-human-readable state sharing (URLs) and is also <i>indexed and searchable</i> is nothing short of incredible.<p>Yes, the basic abstractions we use are the same. We will have URLs that address content in our applications. But now these are applications running on Google&#x27;s own servers. Google is running my application (and hundreds of thousands more), and trying to understand what they mean to humans. This is a pretty amazing step forward.<p>Imagine Apple announcing it would run all iOS applications, interacting like a user to build a search index.

One of the areas where it has improved by leaps and bounds is in the documentation of it&#x27;s &quot;sql&quot; like query language.<p>The tcp api and the http api are well documented as well. And if you are learning to use orient db for the first time. The getting started guide, and the wiki on main concepts is great and you will get up to speed pretty quickly. There are 240 pages(!) in the wiki so it is pretty exhaustive in case you need to know about orient db more ddeply.<p>Where I feel it lacks is in the documentation of client libraries.   since orient db could be used both using http and the client libraries I was not sure which one would be the best choice. I had a good experience using the http api in couchdb and elastic search so my first instinct was to use that but I am still not sure if it is the right way?<p>Any way I think the orient db documentation is fantastic but it could do with better organization and probably some tips from devs on how to use it best. If I ever need a graph database I am definitely using orient db.<p>As a side note I think orient db&#x27;s reputation of a graph database might be doing it more harm than good since it is really much more than that. It can save data as documents, build relationships on them and even do full text search. I think the orient db guys should focus efforts on marketing other aspects of orient db (like the awesome sql language) besides the graph part.",1401213475

Since I do all of my development directly in the browser, I never know how big I need my icons until I&#x27;ve done some experimenting with different sizes.

7805827,comment,7805144,7805690,4,0,fixermark,,,"The counter-point is that (a) the number of applications competing for resources is semi-determinate, constrained by the user&#x27;s patience and willingness to upgrade and (b) the number of users the server must support is similarly semi-determinant, constrained by the popularity of the service, size of data a user could want to manipulate, and the desired speed of those manipulations. There&#x27;s an argument to be made for the economy of scale of pushing some of the presentation work to the side of the wire where there is a user who wants to consume the data; I wouldn&#x27;t want to have to use, say, Google Spreadsheets as a server-side-only product.<p>Note that we can reduce this line of thinking to absurdity if we substitute JavaScript with, say, video; some clients are incapable of rendering video, some clients are constrained in the size of video they can render. Do we therefore never stream video down the wire, and require the client to grab the whole video element wholesale as a single request-response? Of course not; users don&#x27;t want to wait that long. So developers make an educated guess on what their clients&#x27; user-agents can do and set a sane bar for size and scope of video content. A similar sane bar can be set for richness of client-side executable code interactions.",1401213439

7805824,comment,7805321,7805750,5,0,autarch,,,"Well, you can factor in car maintenance to your costs as a driver. Given that the drivers would probably <i>own</i> a car regardless (because they need it for other things) the additional wear and tear is almost certainly more than compensated for with the extra income.<p>Also, if this is self-employment (which it sounds like it is) then the drivers can deduct $0.56 per mile they drive from their taxes.<p>As for a violation fee, I assume that for cabbies that&#x27;s to cover the cost of tickets they get, not that it exempts them from receiving them. With Uber, you can judge the risk yourself. Presumably, just like with a taxi, it makes sense to accept an occasional ticket as the cost of doing business.<p>Overall, it seems like it&#x27;s economically reasonable to be an Uber driver.<p>The big difference between Uber and a cab is that the existing regulatory regimes in many cities allow the cab company owners to extract most of the value from their drivers.",1401213408

My degree was in biology. So far, it hasn&#x27;t really helped at all. If I were going to start over, I would skip college and start a business.<p>My student debt is higher than average, so let&#x27;s be more conservative and use the $25,000 average debt stated in the article. For $25,000, you can create a pretty nice little business, especially in a small city. For example, I lived in Fargo for a few years where my living expenses were only $800 per month. Even if that business fails, you are no worse off than a college grad, except you also have years of experience for when you try another business.<p>I think the real question we should be asking is not &quot;Is college worth it?&quot;, but rather, &quot;How do we help young adults start businesses the way we help them get into college?&quot;. We spend so much time and money offering scholarships, which in turn is supposed to help them get good jobs. In other words, we are spending a lot of money to increase competition in the job market.

I&#x27;m not making some pie-in-the-sky assertion that arguments should be devoid of emotion, just that I had noticed what appeared enough emotion to overrule civil discourse in the past.<p>That said, after re-reading your original comment, I don&#x27;t see much to disagree on (except for one thing, which I&#x27;ll cover later), and it doesn&#x27;t seem to exhibit many of the problems I was alluding to, so you have my apologies.  It was inappropriate of me to bring that up in this context.<p>What I should have commented on was that Parrot was all but dead long before MoarVM put the last nail in the coffin.  I doubt the announcement did much beyond cement what most developers already knew - Parot was not well suited for it&#x27;s original purpose, whether you view that as a VM for P6 or a general purpose VM, specifically because for too long it had tried to follow both paths to the detriment of all.<p>My impression of Parrot, as an outsider who consumed quite a bit of the public information available about parrot development, ended up being that Parrot was <i>too</i> experimental of a VM, and never moved beyond the stage of being a fun sandbox for developers to come experiment in.  When P6 was still coalescing around how to implement what was in the spec (and revising the spec in light of that), this didn&#x27;t matter much.  As P6 increasingly moved towards an actual implementation, Parrot&#x27;s misalignment with what P6 needed along with Parrot&#x27;s deprecation policy caused many problems between the projects.<p>I think at one point, prior to MoarVM being announced, there was still a chance Parrot could have been &quot;saved&quot;.  But by saved, I mean continue on as a sandbox for developers to experiment in, possibly without ever culminating in a VM that was useful as primary target for a language.  If enough developers would have been willing to continue with this truth exposed (and I&#x27;m not sure enough would), then if Parrot and made the choice to continue as a &quot;general purpose VM&quot; instead of primarily a P6 target, it may have survived as a sandbox.<p>I&#x27;m interested in your opinion on this interpretation - not because I think any of it is news to you, I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not - but the opposite, in fact.  This view is in no small part informed by your own writings on the subject over the years.<p>P.S.

At some point robot harvested, hydroponically grown, vegetables will cap the cost of producing food that way. And if the &#x27;old fashioned&#x27; way will become more expensive than that.<p>The key difference in cost between the two is, as you point out, the cost of energy. Using &#x27;free&#x27; solar power versus using grow lights, changes the equation fairly dramatically. But one of the possible futures is that humans will master the ability to harvest more abundant energy. In so doing, I believe humans will have changed the economics of hydroponics dramatically, and things like pest control and labor cost advantages will swing over to the hydroponics side.",1401212690

Time to market for a product\n    2. Easy / clean refactoring\n    3. Massive scale code base management\n    4. Program longevity and maintainability\n</code></pre>\n1) Time to market is extremely important for businesses and products and schedule over-flow is a <i>common</i> problem in software engineering that Haskell <i>really does help solve</i>. Since building production software in Haskell I&#x27;ve become completely frustrated by Python because I spend far more time building in it due to <i>debugging my own undisciplined habits out of the end product</i>. I&#x27;m not a very disciplined dynamic type programmer.<p>It also produces <i>cleaner and less buggy</i> product for the end-user. Which is so important!!! Particularly as a startup.<p>2) If you need to cleanup some technical debt from taking short-cuts or not accurately pre-planning architecture, Haskell&#x27;s type system makes it <i>so friggin&#x27; easy</i> your eyes will bleed when you try to do the same in a Python / Ruby / Erlang program.<p>Additionally, it really allows you to respond to the market better too! If you have to pivot your product it&#x27;s not &quot;Oh shit, now we&#x27;re going to have to take that duct taped sewage monster and turn it into a duct taped ninja turtle.&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;Hmmm, well, let&#x27;s think through the new types a little bit and re-shape some of this code, I know the compiler will tell me when I&#x27;m being a silly human.&quot;<p>3. Python and Ruby aren&#x27;t really appropriate for large scale code bases because dynamic typing means you need an equally massive amount of tests to ensure no one else in the org fucks shit up. It makes team based programming on the same codebase far more manageable!!<p>4. Once I&#x27;ve built my Haskell programs and wrote a few minor property tests with QuickCheck, they usually <i>run forever</i>. I&#x27;ve rarely ever had a case where I would get unexpected crashes (usually from my not understanding Haskell&#x27;s laziness earlier on in my Haskell career).<p>Long-term maintainability is massive factor here too; it&#x27;s so much easier to figure out what the damn thing and all of its constituent pieces do with the type system!!! It&#x27;s like having an index and a table of contents for a book. Since most programmers forget their own code anyway (comes back to that fallible human thing), having a neat and correct <i>abstract description</i> of your program and its parts is invaluable to a commercial enterprise.<p>So, in short, I actually think Haskell is the <i>best language</i> a commercial enterprise could choose. All you need too is one really good programmer that can mentor, then train them as you go; the good news with Haskell is even when you write shitty Haskell code (un-idiomatic, mostly in the IO monad, and barring space leaks), it&#x27;s usually better than even the good Python and Ruby code those people would be writing.",1401212051

Some type of math errors would overlap between Excel and Python.  Some types of errors would be easier to stumble into in Python than Excel.<p>For example, an inexperienced programmer in Python might use floating point instead of Decimal data type to add currency amounts.  His programming loop to sum the amounts would be <i>incorrect</i>.  In MS Excel, adding currency in cells correctly down to the penny is a no brainer.  Sure, the Python programmer can be taught &quot;best practices&quot; to avoid this type of error but the point is that while Python helps eliminates some errors, it also creates new ones.<p>Another example is data munging.  A programmer might write some Python to slurp a data file (exported from mainframe or whatever) and do some financial calculation on it.  Load the values into an array some other memory structure.  The problem is that the memory contents are &quot;hidden&quot; from sight unless the programmer uses a visual debugger or prints out all the values to inspect.  The Python programmer may not notice that some values are misaligned or garbage.  With Excel, the non-programmer imports the data file and he immediately scrolls through the worksheet as a sanity check. His eyeballs notice that the source data is dirty.  Again, the Python &quot;problem&quot; can be corrected with best practices but the point still remains:  different tools create different problems.<p>Lastly, Excel spreadsheets are easily emailed among dozens of people.  You can&#x27;t send ???.py programs to everyone because you can&#x27;t expect all the Windows users to have the Python runtime.  Spreadsheets are even sent to iPhones and tablets and you definitely can&#x27;t expect easy Python deployment there.  With less coworkers examining the ???.py file, it has potential for <i>more errors</i> compared to a scenario where everybody can participate in questioning the spreadsheet&#x27;s numbers.<p>Our intuition says that <i>on balance</i>, the hypothetical Python/Haskell solution should have less errors than MS Excel but I can&#x27;t confidently say I&#x27;ve seen any definitive proof of that.",1401211740

You can most certainly put in tests and other safety factors; back in the 90s I built spreadsheets for tasks ranging from electricity market pricing  (for a national power generation company) to interest-rate shopping (for banks to allocate expense spending). There were tests and tests of tests because the sheets were shuffling around huge quantities of money. The object was not just to arrive at the best outcome every month but to generate a defensible audit trail that referenced the canonical steps of the manual procedure.<p>I get that programmers hate the formulae being distributed all over the place, but this is precisely the advantage for business people; they want to be able to &#x27;walk the heap&#x27; and follow the provenance of individual values back to the source, and they want to see things in parallel at all times. CS people lean towards theoretical provability, business people are inclined towards using statistical sampling. So I would write unit tests that would lock most of a spreadsheet while running a batch of checks on the contents of individual sub-sheets, then lock the validated sheet, unlock the next sub-sheet and copy-by-value the data into that for the next round; but I would also load up random historical batches that were known-good and make sure all the final totals matched.<p>Sure, spreadsheets are inefficient, but a mistake in an a very efficient process can easily lead to monstrous results. And from the domain specialist&#x27;s point of view (ie the accountants/business managers), the inefficiency cost of doing things in spreadsheets is <i>far</i> preferable to the costs of auditing a black-box process at a later date if queries arise about its integrity.",1401211554

When uncompressed the files total 20 terabytes. The files contained approximately 21 billion tweets, each with more than 50 accompanying metadata fields, such as place and description.<p>As of December 1, 2012,the Library has received more than 150 billion additional tweets and corresponding metadata, for a total including the 2006-2010 archive of approximately 170 billion tweets totaling 133.2 terabytes for two compressed copies.&quot;<p>I find the quantities hilarious. \nBut since they haven&#x27;t been able to cope with providing access yet I get pessimistic about their prospects of doing so at all any time soon.<p>Can we do something to help them?<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking maybe GPU-accelerated databases like MapD, could mitigate the cost issue for them, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that doesn&#x27;t go all the way to solving the problem...",1401210439

Perhaps your Facebook interactions are all dour and joyless because the people you interact with are dour and joyless online? In any case, it&#x27;s hardly proper to speak this opinion as if it were fact.<p>* Comparison of ad targeting data to the &quot;pink files&quot; collected for the express purpose of destroying LGBTs, or data collected by various secret police.<p>Why this is problematic is left as an exercise for the reader.<p>I&#x27;m going to coin a phrase here. You know &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;? I&#x27;m going to call this &quot;reductio ad missionem malum&quot; - reduction to the worst case scenario. A close relative of the slippery slope.<p>In this case, the thesis appears to be &quot;Lots of data is collected, therefore burn it all to the ground because it can be misused by the bad guys with guns.&quot;<p>2) Their arguments are not followed to their logical conclusion.<p>Much hand wringing is done (not by the author necessarily, but in general) about the world when everyone&#x27;s &quot;youthful indiscretions&quot; and &quot;every mistake&quot; are available online, permanently, for the world to see. Fast forward a decade or so after that line is crossed. What happens when everyone has dirt on everyone? Does that not greatly lessen this impact? It&#x27;s pretty hard for the guys in suits and dark glasses to blackmail you for something when <i>that information is already out there</i>.<p>It would be a type of &quot;post-privacy&quot; society, in other words. It is fundamentally different from what we have now, where we have a public personality and a private personality. This carries some positives, some negatives, and I feel it has yet to be discussed in an objective way.<p>3) Instead of advocating for greater privacy controls that make sense, they instead advocate for measures like the EU&#x27;s misaimed and &quot;feel good&quot; &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; law.<p>Look at what the author advocates for:<p>* &quot;Limit what kind of behavioral data websites can store. When I say behavioral data, I mean the kinds of things computers notice about you in passing—your search history, what you click on, what cell tower you&#x27;re using.&quot;<p>I for one GREATLY LOOK FORWARD</s> to the day when bureaucrats tell me how my nginx access logs must be formatted and stored (after all, they contain, fairly explicitly &quot;what you click on&quot;). I also look forward with the same enthusiasm to how such a thing will ever be enforced and to find out how much money will be allocated to this particular measure.<p>I think this is approaching the problem from the wrong angle.<p>The author says that this is an implementation problem. I, for one, do not want that implementation decided by people who don&#x27;t understand how technology works. Unfortunately, that seems to be the case whenever you have tech-by-legislative-diktat.<p>Let me give you an example by way of the next item:<p>* &quot;Enforce the right to delete. I should be able to delete my account and leave no trace in your system, modulo some reasonable allowance for backups.&quot;<p>Remember how I said the EU law was misaimed and &quot;feel good&quot;? A case where this would do more harm than good: Hacker News. Or indeed any other discussion forum or mailing list archive. Imagine a prolific and quality contributor here, like such as tpacek or even PG. Now imagine that for whatever reason, one of these people want to be &quot;forgotten&quot; and invoke this law.<p>Imagine what this would do to every single thread that person has ever participated in. Context would be utterly annihilated. This would eviscerate, in the most disgusting sense of the word, most any discussion forum.<p>I came up with this edge case in less than 60 seconds of thought, and I don&#x27;t even begin to rank on the list of smartest people on HN. If  I can locate such a problem with so little effort, that means both that the people who wrote this law don&#x27;t know what the fuck they&#x27;re on about, and it also means that worse edge cases probably exist.<p>I would say that the legislation needs to target behavior, not tech. Ensuring that private data remains so even after mergers, acquisitions, etc? Excellent. Penalties on companies that misstep? Great idea. Ensuring that government types have to go through the full judicial processes (none of this secret-court-rubber-stamp malarky) to access this data? Awesome!<p>Making me destroy my website because someone wants to disappear themselves? Less so.",1401210359
