Good old incrementing counters have none of those issues and are absolutely trivial to implement. They never fail, never drift, never repeat, by definition. As I said a few posts above, the typical structure of a &quot;unique id&quot; based on a counter has three counters:<p><pre><code>    1. nodename (or machine name if you will)\n\n    2. namespace (you can have one per thread to avoid contention issues)\n\n    3. local (monotonically increases within the namespace).\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s say your node id is 256, and it runs on 4 threads, one per core + 1 thread for the scheduler. You need five namespaces:<p>256.0-4.* (where * is increasing monotonically 0, 1, 2, 3, 4...)<p>And once you have to reboot the node, you obtain five new namespaces:<p>256.5-9.*<p>And the * counters start over from zero on each. As for how big should each segment be, that depends on what you want to do with the nodes I suppose. But the 128-bit UUID size should never be some kind of guide regarding size; maybe you need three shorts, maybe you need three longs, maybe short.medium.long etc., it&#x27;ll depend on the use case.",1399542662

7714500,comment,7713916,7713916,1,0,jakejake,,,"Looking at the &quot;about us&quot; page the company has 8 employees.  Six of them seem to be either executive level or skilled technical employees who possibly would earn similar salaries anyway.  Then there&#x27;s two that seem, from the description, to be what I would consider more general-skilled employees. My takeaway is that this strategy results in two employees making an unusually high salary for their position, while the founder/owners are probably taking less money than they could.  Assuming there aren&#x27;t some secret bonuses or stock options I&#x27;d say it seems generous on the part of the owners.<p>That being said I think this idea is not too far off from communism which can tend to reward people for doing the bare minimum.  So I would think it would rely on the fact that everybody at the company has the desire to work hard and contribute a similar amount of effort.  Otherwise eventually some people will become angry that their hard work is not worth any more than somebody else&#x27;s lazy habits.",1399540701
