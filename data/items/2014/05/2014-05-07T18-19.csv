7712030,comment,7710140,7711229,1,0,mhandley,,,"Well, the goal of a properly designed transport protocol is to transfer X bytes in 0 seconds.  TCP doesn&#x27;t quite achieve that, but that is its goal.  This pretty much dictates †hat for any reasonable sized download, somewhere on the path is congested.  If that congestion isn&#x27;t at the server (it usually isn&#x27;t), and isn&#x27;t in the backbone (it usually isn&#x27;t), then it&#x27;s either your consumer ISP or your computer (it usually isn&#x27;t).  ISP&#x27;s tend to oversubscribe backhaul to make the economics work, so if you&#x27;re not getting your full linkspeed, then it&#x27;s likely the backhaul that&#x27;s congested, and everyone else is seeing congestion too.<p>There are exceptions of course.  Older OSes have ridiculously small TCP receive windows, and older TCP congestion control algorithms have trouble filling the pipe.  But these shouldn&#x27;t really be the main problem these days.  It doesn&#x27;t apply so much for streaming either, because modern streaming protocols such as MPEG-DASH will select a lower bitrate stream if they sense congestion.",1399489158

7712012,comment,7704897,7711316,1,0,hajile,,,"In python, it would be proper to say that ALL functions are lambdas except that some/most of those lambdas are assigned to variables via syntactic sugar (this is made very plain in sicp which is the main reason for suggesting it).The only thing different about python vs most other languages is guido refusing to implement multi-line lambdas.<p>As to any complaint, lambdas exist in python (that is, are made accessible to the programmer) for the exact reason python also has a for loop in addition to a while loop -- because they make things easier and more maintainable.<p><pre><code>  def myApplyAdd(func, x):\n    return lambda y: func(x+y)\n\n  applyAddInst = myApplyAdd(lambda z: z*2, 20)\n  applyAddInst(3) #output 26\n</code></pre>\nbecomes much less maintainable without lambdas and pollutes the scope with unnecessary variables you must then keep track of<p><pre><code>  def myApplyAdd(func, x):\n    def innerAdd (y):\n      return func(x + y)\n    return innerAdd\n\n  def mulByTwo(x):\n    return x*2\n\n  applyAddInstance = myApplyAdd(mulByTwo, 20)\n  applyAddInst(3) #output 26\n</code></pre>\nI would also note that list comprehensions make heavy use of lambdas. For example, the following is actually using a for loop and calling<p><pre><code>  lambda i: i**2\n</code></pre>\neach each iteration<p><pre><code>  result = [ i**2 for i in range(3, 30) ]</code></pre>",1399488960

The real problem is bad UX/software, fueled by underlying protocols that assume relatively stable and authoritative server hosts.<p>I used to run email/dns/web/etc off of Speakeasy (and college before that, and dialup before that), but I switched to Linode (like 8 years ago) and haven&#x27;t looked back. It really sucks when your home server has a hardware issue/power outage/changing things around/etc, and you feel like you need to fix it ASAFP lest your emails/etc start getting bounced/etc (yes, smtp is supposed to queue. no, that doesn&#x27;t alleviate the concern).<p>What I <i>really</i> want is my home server to act as the primary contact, but when that is down, Linode to serve on my behalf seamlessly, obvious to message contents. And of course I <i>could</i> set something like that up per-protocol (modulo incoming ports being firewalled, etc), but the more complex setup one makes for themselves, the more likely things are to just decay over time.<p>We&#x27;re not even at the point where having a distributed <i>file store</i> is straightforward. The best I&#x27;ve found is running Unison across multiple hosts/disks, and I still find myself spending way too much time dealing with administration and overcoming its limitations (cycle-intolerant topology, lack of access levels, etc). Anything else I&#x27;ve seen assumes a reliable central host, constant network connection, would need to be babied in different ways, or is just not robust enough to trust.<p>Meanwhile with these centralized solutions, they <i>just work out of the box</i>. There are occasional or hidden issues like service outages, vendor dependence, lack of flexibility due to arbitrary restrictions, planned obsolescence, anti-features like ads, abdicating your <i>computing</i> to opaque code you don&#x27;t control, supporting the destruction of the Internet (what prompted this slew of articles? Netflix setting a terrible precedent..), etc. But the effort required to initially get them working is basically nonexistent.

You want to have useful abstractions that you can rely on.<p>The rabbit hole goes very deep indeed, and a lot of concepts that programmers treat as concrete are themselves abstractions that hide a lot of complexity.<p>The difference in level of abstraction between Java and Haskell is much smaller than the difference from either of them to what the actual machine is doing. In both cases you have a compiler, a language runtime, an OS & kernel, and processor microcode in between you and &quot;the metal&quot;. Actually Java has one extra step, because javac emits bytecode that needs to run in the JVM, whereas ghc emits binaries that can be run directly by the operating system.<p>(Your comment about O(n^2) in time is beside the point -- quicksort is always worst case O(n^2), so it wouldn&#x27;t be quicksort otherwise. All the implementations we&#x27;re talking about have that same asymptotic behavior. The problem with the naive Haskell implementation isn&#x27;t the big-O time, it&#x27;s the big-O memory, which went from O(1) to more like O(n log n).)",1399488523

The number is a sham.<p>Yet it has somehow become conventional wisdom, parroted in every thread on this subject.<p>> Were provisions for a particular level of broadband penetration and performance included in the 1996 Telecom Act? If so, was the inclusion of these provisions tied in any way to the more provider-friendly regulatory posture granted as a result of the Act?<p>No. The purpose of the act was deregulation of the industry, not giving regulatory concessions in return for particular performance outcomes. Whether deregulation is &quot;provider-friendly&quot; depends on who you ask. In theory, deregulation is consumer-friendly. E.g. whenever Uber or AirBnB come up, people on HN champion deregulation of those markets, on the theory that deregulation is good for consumers. That was the operative theory underlying the 1996 Telecom Act.<p>Now as for whether the pitch back then lived up to the results, the answer is of course &quot;kinda.&quot; The state of U.S. internet is really much better than people say. Read my post about what Akamai has to say about actual connection speeds in the U.S. versus Europe (that we&#x27;re ahead of the big European countries like the UK, Germany, and France): <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709948"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7709948</a>.<p>What people fixate on is the lack of fiber in major cities, and that has much more to do with dysfunctional municipal politics than national telecom regulation. In Chicago, for example, many folks have a choice between Comcast and RCN (which has a mostly fiber network). This is not because Comcast didn&#x27;t bribe enough alderman, but simply because the city tends to have a pretty functional and hands-off approach to regulation, which reduces the roadblocks to market entrants. The city also has never instituted rent controls, and unsurprisingly has pretty affordable housing for city of its size and density.<p>> What I don&#x27;t think: doubling down on deregulation at this point - which is what this fast-lane stuff seems like to me - will be a long-term benefit for consumers, which (as a consumer) is what I currently care most about.<p>The problem with &quot;pro-consumer&quot; regulation is that it&#x27;s often short-sighted. Throughout the U.S. in the 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s and 1990&#x27;s, and in Europe in the 1980&#x27;s, 1990&#x27;s, and 2000&#x27;s, industries were deregulated, and it was largely a positive thing. The biggest problem with &quot;pro-consumer&quot; regulation in telecom is that it makes investment in regulated telecom unattractive, which causes investment dollars to flow into areas that are more attractive.<p>When I say &quot;1970&#x27;s style regulation is discredited&quot; I absolutely mean it. Governments across the political spectrum have backed away from that style of regulation and embraced ones better-rooted in economic reality. But utility and telecom regulation is rooted in that same failed ideology. It&#x27;s the ideology where regulators think it&#x27;s a good idea to set prices instead of letting the market do so, or tell companies that they can only achieve a 10% return instead of whatever the market will bear. This style of regulation ignores the basic fact that the economy is inter-connected. If you tell companies in an industry that they can&#x27;t raise prices, all the capital will flow to an industry where they can.<p>That&#x27;s exactly what happened with telecom. Post-1996, the most heavily regulated communications infrastructure was the telephone system. Cable was less regulated, and so was wireless. And what happened? All the capital flowed to upgrading cable and wireless networks, and DSL was essentially killed as a potential competitor because there was not sufficient profit motive in DSL.<p>Now, I&#x27;m not saying network neutrality is 1970&#x27;s-style regulation, it&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s not rate setting, or regulated rates of return, or anything like that. But when people say &quot;the telcos took $200 billion and didn&#x27;t give us fiber&quot; well that&#x27;s absolutely a contention that only makes sense if you buy into the 1970&#x27;s ideology: that the public would&#x27;ve saved $200 billion had the industry continued to be regulated the way it was pre-1996, but that despite these regulations we&#x27;d still have the level of infrastructure investment we do today.",1399488106

7711922,comment,7710733,7711326,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"LH2 is also super cryogenic. LOX and even liquid methane have boiling points higher than LN2. You can build launchers with them without even bothering to insulate the tanks, because the boiloff is so marginal over the duration of the launch. Whereas LH2 absolutely requires a lot of insulation, because it needs to be much, much colder. Worse yet, because of the super low density of LH2 you can&#x27;t afford even a small amount of boiloff because that hurts your mass fraction immensely, and if you have a LOX/LH2 vehicle you&#x27;ve probably scraped and scrabbled for what meager mass fraction you&#x27;ve managed to achieve (through advanced alloys and so forth). One particular consequence of the use of LH2 with the Shuttle was that it resulted in an ice covered and foam insulated enormous external tank cheek-by-jowl with the delicate TPS coated underbelly of the orbiter during launch, as the vehicle rammed through the air at transonic then supersonic then hypersonic speeds.<p>Another consequence of the LH2 choice for the Shuttle is that it didn&#x27;t have enough thrust at sea level to get off the pad, so it needed high-thrust, low-cost boosters as a 0th stage. Solid rockets being the obvious go-to solution, those got used.<p>In a very real way the choice to use LH2 resulted not just in much of the cost and complexity of the Shuttle system but also the death of 2 crews and the loss of 2 orbiters.",1399487886

7711865,comment,7710733,7711671,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"The SSMEs were bleeding edge engines when they were built. Moreover, they were strapped to the Shuttle orbiter so every time they were used they were on for an entire flight from sea level through the entirety of the atmosphere up through vacuum. Then they spent a week or two in cold soak on orbit. Then they experienced a mach 25 re-entry and the jostling of an unpowered horizontal landing at a few hundred kph.<p>Oh, also, I should mention how difficult it is to optimize an engine for vacuum as well as sea level operation. In a vacuum you want a high expansion ratio nozzle because that maximizes Isp, but it also lowers pressure. That doesn&#x27;t work if you have to fight against 1 atm of sea level pressure. That alone is actually a big reason why rockets have multiple stages, because the Isp boost of the high-expansion ratio nozzle on the upper stage is an enormous performance win. One way around the problem is to boost the exhaust pressure, enabling a higher expansion ratio nozzle which can still operate at sea level, but that makes the engine even more complex and difficult to manufacture, let alone reuse.<p>So you have the SSME which is a high pressure staged combustion regeneratively cooled LOX/LH2 engine optimized for <i>both</i> sea level and vacuum operation. It&#x27;s a wonder they were reusable to any degree whatsoever within the first several flights. Even so it took until the mid 1990s for the engine design to fully mature and enter a truly operational phase (vs. prototype phase).<p>Meanwhile, let&#x27;s look at what SpaceX has on their plate. They have a low pressure (1/3 the psi of the SSME) gas-generator cycle (non-staged combustion) LOX/Kerosene pintle injector engine which uses two different nozzles for sea level and vacuum operation. It&#x27;s a design with heritage back to an era <i>before color television</i>. It&#x27;s such a tried-and-true design with so much history that the patents on it expired decades ago. Additionally, in contrast to all the rigmarole an SSME has to go through for each flight the Merlin-1D merely accelerates to a fraction of orbital speed, never leaves the atmosphere, and, in a reuse scenario, is back at the launch site within minutes. No hypersonic atmospheric flight. No re-entry. No bumpy landing. No cold soak. No transition from atmospheric to vacuum operation.<p>It&#x27;s a vastly simpler engine which is exposed to vastly less strenuous conditions.<p>Again, if you think that the Merlin-1D will face anything approaching the problems of the SSME in reusability then you are either extraordinarily ill-informed or you are peddling propaganda.",1399487287

I mean, they can crank out some decent hardware, but their software is consistently abysmal. I have a Note 3. Ignore the plasticy and cheesy (fake leather stitching? Really?) exterior, and it&#x27;s a decent piece of kit. But the included software is consistently crap. I bought the Note for the stylus, but both S Note and Action Memo apps that are to be used with the stylus consistently lost data. I think they fixed it in a later update (haven&#x27;t lost data lately), but it doesn&#x27;t inspire confidence.<p>The prime example is Samsung&#x27;s new Gear Fit. It just plain doesn&#x27;t work as advertised, and it&#x27;s due to unbelievably broken software. The only things that work reliably are the notifications and the pedometer. And though the pedometer works (if a bit inaccurately) the data reporting is broken. I mean so broken that if you want a historical listing of your steps each day, you&#x27;ll have to write it down because the data reporting is grossly inaccurate. Everything else, including most exercise functionality, just doesn&#x27;t work.

Two hardware products with amateur-level software (with apologies to all amateur developers out there; your stuff is likely better than Samsung&#x27;s) are the only chances Samsung will get with me. And if they think I&#x27;m letting one of their Internet-connected TVs (with mic and camera) in my house, they&#x27;re delusional.<p>The Gear Fit brought to mind another question that I&#x27;ll likely never get an answer to: how does this happen? Fine, you made some really bad dev hires. But don&#x27;t you have a test team? Does the test team suck, or are they just ignored? What about project management?

Large Erlang applications can be understood as a collection of objects that happen to be running concurrently, and I explicitly mean that OO intuitions about responsibility, identity, and substitutability can be fairly directly used. In that sense, I don&#x27;t think Erlang is actually a very functional language in practice. Erlang programs tend to look like one&#x27;s initial, high-level overview of a how an OO program will look when you first draw a sketch, with each circle in the diagram becoming a process (or more accurately, type of process, e.g., a &quot;connection&quot; process that may be instantiated once per connection).",1399485927

The worst part is that most of the baby bell solutions are slow-ass DSL.<p>For instance, in most of Metro-Atlanta, you can get Comcast or AT&T UVerse (AT&T being the name of what was a Baby Bell, Cingular). UVerse is simply slow-as-shit DSL and is awful. (Fun fact: AT&T tried to sell and promote UVerse as Fiber in the mid-2000s. My parents have fiber in their home but no way to get a fiber provider -- AT&T was over-selling them on a &quot;fiber&quot; solution that was literally just copper DSL wires. The whole telecom industry is full of crooks).<p>In New York City, you basically have one provider. If you&#x27;re very lucky and live in an area Verizon (another former baby bell) also services, you can get Fiber -- and that&#x27;s awesome -- but the zoning for this stuff is often street by street. The building across the street from my apartment can get Verizon. My building can&#x27;t -- for whatever reason. Verizon did tell me they could probably rig me access if I could get them access to the basement -- but I&#x27;m not the building owner and I don&#x27;t have time to deal with what happens when the line gets cut accidentally.<p>I&#x27;m very fortunate that my Internet/TV provider is relatively sane (Cablevision) -- if I lived three blocks further away, I&#x27;d be stuck in TWC hell.<p>What most consumers also don&#x27;t know is that in many areas, the cable provider can be chosen by the property management company (if you&#x27;re in an apartment complex) or the condo association. So what happens is that operators will &quot;bid&quot; on that area - and the lowest bid wins. The problem is, even if you live in a Comcast or Verizon or whatever area, you still can&#x27;t get that service. You&#x27;re required to be with whoever your property management or co-op board chose. I actually didn&#x27;t buy a condo that was in a great location and had a great floorplan because of their choice of ISP/cable provider.<p>The whole system is fucked. It really is. And the net neutrality and fast-lane aspects are only a small part of a much more broken and corrupt system.<p>That said, just because we can&#x27;t fix the whole system -- and we can&#x27;t -- doesn&#x27;t mean we can&#x27;t put pressure on companies to not fuck customers over even more, by making access-agreements for content.
