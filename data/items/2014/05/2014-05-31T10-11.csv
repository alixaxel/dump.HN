Norvig&#x27;s spelling corrector is an application of inverting the problem.<p>Instead of attempting to correct a misspelling, he attempts to misspell a word, then stores the misspelled word along with the original word. Then, to correct a misspelling, you simply look it up in the hash table.<p>Incredibly powerful mathematical concept that inversion thing. And there&#x27;s a million of them.<p>Other &quot;tricks&quot;:<p>* shuffling a deck of cards in O(1) (or shuffling anything at all)<p>* sorting in O(N) (with a limited keyset, and guaranteed no repetitions it&#x27;s easy. Think about it).<p>* knowing the url to MIT&#x27;s bit twiddling manual [1]<p>* know how to &quot;rewrite&quot; english (or any language) text. Really impressive. Also, mostly useless. It&#x27;s called Markov Chains.<p>* understand how and why &quot;every language compiles first to LISP, then to machine code&quot; is true. Thinking about this yields no end of clever programming tricks<p>* make sure to have spent a few months in each style of programming. Imperative (doesn&#x27;t tend to be a problem). Functional (NEVER change the value of a variable, ever, for any reason). Dynamic (write a calculator using eval, and go from there. Exploit it).<p>* having the experience that any style of configuration eventually ends up being a turing complete programming language, and so you should just import and use an existing language<p>* having experienced the power of query languages. Instead of having a few reports, implement an interpreter that allows you to query them. Then amaze everyone by having every new report they ask for done in 10 minutes.<p>* knowing the power of automated source translation tools, and how easy these things are to write IF you can munster the discipline of never touching generated code<p>All of these things will have people tell you it&#x27;s impossible. And when they see simple code that demonstrates things like this, it&#x27;s cheating (e.g. O(N) sorting is not fully general.

But of course you still have to use a pen for exams, and one time I got carried away and used my pencil like I was used to. The examiner chewed me for a good ten minutes.<p>The whole point, of course, is that when you write in ink, it can&#x27;t be easily erased and changed, while if it&#x27;s written with a pencil, you could bribe the examiner to change it (or any number of other shenanigans). I guess Americans don&#x27;t try to cheat as much.",1401530688

Sure, it&#x27;s wonderful in the common case, but when it comes to things like vectors or (apparently) unsafe pointer manipulation, it&#x27;s practically unreadable. Something like Lisp or Python— or even C++— syntax is rarely optimal, but at least it never degenerates this totally into symbol soup.",1401530552

As soon as I came to college in the US and realized I could submit work in pencil, I ditched all my pens like termite-infested bricks.<p>In my opinion, pencils are clearly superior for everyday tasks. Basically, just with the fact that they can be better erased. To me personally, they feel better to work with because they have finer pressure-based control. This is why a lot of artists always draft in pencil, and leave a lot of details in pencil too. Manga artists, architects, proofreaders, some stenographers, etc use a lot of pencil. Several of these end up inking their work afterword, or using pencil-work just for drafts that are later digitized.<p>However, I can go on about objective reasons why pencils are just better regardless, no particular applications necessarily.<p>They&#x27;re cheaper. They&#x27;re not going to go dry because you &#x27;lost the cap&#x27; or it&#x27;s old. You know a pencil is going to work if it has any lead poking out. It&#x27;s consistent and reliable compared to pens suddenly not working mid-word. They&#x27;re lighter to hold (less tiring and strenuous on your wrist to write for a long time). If they break they&#x27;re not going to get everything in your bag stained. They can write well on many more surfaces than most pens. If one pencil fails for some reason (lost?) you can just get almost any nearby pencil and resume (unless you&#x27;re in an advanced application field like technical drawing or manga artistry) without your work looking strange (2-toned).<p>I keep a pen around for the sole purpose of signing forms and writing checks (where the fact they&#x27;re harder to modify is actually a good thing), and filling things people ask me to fill in pen.",1401530491
