For example, one of djb&#x27;s suggestions is to reuse the existing floating-point unit for crypto: to make small changes, exposing the functionality of the internal, 53-bit integer multiplier that&#x27;s a component of the 64-bit floating point multiplier. There&#x27;s already eight of these in each core (with AVX, since 2011), costing a formidable number of transistors. Creating a new crypto unit, either in the CPU or a coprocessor, would duplicate much of them.<p>As djb emphasizes in the article, if it&#x27;s too expensive it might not make sense for Intel to implement it.",1400381863

7761965,comment,7761134,7761134,2,0,brudgers,,,"Some remarks:<p>+ There&#x27;s a traditional sequence in skilled trades of apprentice -> journeyman -> master. A contemporary trade probably throws student on the front end and perhaps renames apprentice to &#x27;intern&#x27;.<p>What separates a student from an apprentice/intern is the type of problems they work on. The same idea distinguishes the journeyman from the apprentice except that the journeyman is expected to successfully solve the problems they work on. Etc for the master.<p>What I am getting at is that there is a range of expertise and that what marks someone as an expert is the sort of problems they solve. But it&#x27;s critical to realize that the context in which they  solve those problems matters. This week thousands of students will be writing quicksort code. In 1960 it was the stuff of ...well CA Hoare probably was an expert programmer in an absolute sense, and perhaps a new journeyman among those who were programmers. Here again, context matters when talking about expertise...the one-eyed man in the kingdom of the blind and all that.<p>+ It&#x27;s not really clear what you mean by &#x27;expertise&#x27;. An expert AI programmer is someone who has solved expert level problems - one in an academic setting earns a credential. In a vocational setting it&#x27;s going to take several.<p>But in both settings the context is years, not hours per day.<p>+ Sure you&#x27;re free to define what it means to be an expert. Regardless of what definition you choose, the question remains, what does an expert do that you aren&#x27;t doing? This isn&#x27;t a question of research. It&#x27;s not a question of methodology. It&#x27;s a question of personal opinion - that is, what activities would you have to do to meet your definition of an expert. Maybe that&#x27;s working at Google. Maybe it&#x27;s earning a phd. Maybe it&#x27;s writing a replacement for HotSpot.<p>+ Once you know what sort of problems you need to solve to move toward being an expert, perhaps just trying to solve some of those problems is the place to start. I.e. what sort of problems does an apprentice or journeyman tackle?<p>Good luck.",1400381330
7761964,comment,7761486,7761486,1,0,epaulson,,,"The real mismatch is handling failures. The HPC world has grown up handling failures by failing the entire computation. As a defense against failure, they usually checkpoint the entire computation.<p>Part of this is the fault of the MPI standardization process: MPI didn&#x27;t even try to deal with dynamic-but-expected changes to the computation (much less changes caused by &quot;node&quot; failure) because not all of the initial systems MPI was targeting could handle nodes coming or going. In this way, MPI was sort of a step backwards - PVM was much more flexible than MPI from the get-go.<p>I haven&#x27;t paid much attention to MPI in a few years, so maybe some of the MPI-FT approaches have caught on.<p>One of the initial targets for YARN was MPI, but it was never clear to me that any MPI users actually wanted to use YARN.<p>With just a few tweaks, PVM and AFS could have given us a pretty good Big Data stack 15 years ago (And in the case of security, a better stack than what we&#x27;ve got today.) The hardware wasn&#x27;t quite cheap enough to make the case as compelling as it is today, and the MapReduce programming model helped sell the entire approach, but it was a real missed opportunity.",1400381266

This strikes me as more of a genuine argument, and not a flagrant abuse of the system that would likely lead to change:<p>* AGIS seems to be a genuine company, that filed its own patents, and has a real product.  There are much clearer examples of trolls out there.<p>* The patent claims are highly specific.  This is not a &quot;...on the Internet&quot; type patent.<p>* Life360 is not (yet) claiming they don&#x27;t infringe; they are focusing on obviousness.<p>* The patent system now has a relatively straightforward, quick and inexpensive system for getting a patent re-examined.  Life360 hasn&#x27;t (yet) said they will do that.<p>* The Life360 strategy seems to be primarily PR-driven: attention-grabbing language, posting things on Twitter, contacting journalists, etc.  This reminds me of the legal saying: &quot;If you’re weak on the facts and strong on the law, pound the law. If you’re weak on the law and strong on the facts, pound the facts. If you’re weak on both, pound the table.&quot;<p>To my mind, this argument seems more likely to boil down to &quot;should ideas be protected by patents&quot;, instead of &quot;should we do something about shell companies that abuse patent law to extort money&quot;.",1400380854

So ya, Smalltalk objects are &quot;live&quot;, but Smalltalk code is not. So when Hancock invented this term called &quot;live programming&quot; back in 2003, he was focusing on the code (keep in mind, this work exists in a world where Smalltalk is well known, the Morphic paper came out in 1995, and Seymour Papert of Mindstorms/Logo fame is Hancock&#x27;s adviser).<p>The problem with editing the program&#x27;s objects directly is that it is not very powerful in its capability: fine if you want w to always be red, but not fine if their are a hundred w&#x27;s to edit individually, or if w is red because of some kind of active condition. In any case, hot code replacement doesn&#x27;t really help either; its useful for sure, but the next step is to change the program&#x27;s state retroactively [1] to match the new code. Smalltalk never went there, and probably couldn&#x27;t given the hardware constraints of the time. But now, I think we can go there.<p>The Pharo folks are claiming that their system supports live programming capabilities, but it is just the same old live object/fix-and-continue features that Smalltalk has had for ages.

The fastest way to get better at programming is to program more.<p>However:  it sounds like your interests are actually more in the realm of Computer Science than Programming, though:  type theory, theory of computation, compilers, AI, etc. are less in the realm of programming and much more in the realm of computer science.  You don&#x27;t really need to know how an NFA or DFA works in most day to day programming, frankly.  For learning Computer Science, I would suggest finding an advanced course with all of its material online (MIT OpenCourseware is a good place to start, or any of the other free online courses places), and working through a course on the topic. If it has prerequisites that you don&#x27;t know any/most of the material from, then find a course on those.  In my opinion, the other common options (reading through a textbook, reading papers, working on a project related and just learning what you need for that) all have flaws: textbooks are usually designed to accompany a course, which means they usually have much more than you need to learn a lot about the subject (and, in my experience, many are unbelievably boring and poorly written; if you want to go that route, make sure you find ones that are appropriate for self study).  Reading papers is really interesting (and a lot more fun than reading textbooks), but without context or knowledge about the area, it&#x27;s hard to evaluate the paper&#x27;s meaningfulness/claims/etc., and hard to decide which papers are important to read.  Working on just a project (e.x. just writing a compiler) leads to learning just enough to make that project, and not more.\nIf you want to improve at programming:  follow the advice about either making a personal project or working on an open source project.  The fastest way to get better at programming is to program more.<p>Frankly:  it sounds like you are decidedly not as much of an &#x27;expert beginner&#x27; as you think you are.  Familiarity with basic data structures+complexity, an understanding of theory, and an understanding of math through linear, ODEs, and discrete already puts you on a very firm grounding.  (Outside of certain very specific parts of CS, you /do not/ need more math than that.  If you&#x27;re going into graphics research, knowing differential topology+geometry might be handy.  I&#x27;m having a hard time thinking of things other than that, though.) From your description, you have more or less finished the &#x27;beginner&#x27; stage, moved well beyond the &#x27;novice&#x27; stage, and are moving towards becoming someone with a lot of advanced knowledge.  Just knowing that you&#x27;re interested in things like type theory+compilers/machine learning+expert systems+AI already puts you /way/ beyond being a beginner.<p>Shameless plug of someone else&#x27;s stuff:  if you&#x27;re not sure where to start on the courses front, and want to start on the programming languages side of things (compilers, etc.), this course might be a good place to start: <a href=""https://www.udacity.com/course/cs262"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.udacity.com/course/cs262</a>\nI haven&#x27;t worked through this course in particular, and I don&#x27;t know its exact difficulty, but I took undergraduate programming languages from this professor and he&#x27;s an /amazing/ teacher.<p>Edit:  don&#x27;t know why I had two copies of that written, but now there should only be one.

And as you said, dropping DRM can gain as much as 1/3 of sales which are otherwise lost due to users opposing it. So not dropping DRM is simply insane from any business standpoint.<p><i>> You don&#x27;t put up with DRM because it&#x27;s technically easy for your to circumvent, but a lot of people do and are even willing to forego consuming something until it becomes affordable or accessible.</i><p>No, you didn&#x27;t get what I was saying. That&#x27;s not how it works. It works like this:<p>1. DRM-ed release comes out.<p>2. A few pirates who know how to break DRM break it and make the content available DRM-free to other pirates.<p>3. Any subsequent pirate who is interested in that content takes it from that DRM-free pirate source never dealing with any DRM.<p>4.

There could be the usual limit of a karma threshold\nfor the feature. There could be a limit on how many times or how often\nthe flag could be used. There could also be a disincentive such as\nmaking each down-vote or flag cost a lot more (10x/100x/1000x), or\nmaking the use of the flag cost something substantial like -X% of all\naccount karma.<p>With the right combination of limits and disincentives, his idea might\nwork, and only be used on special occasions rather than be (ab)used\nconstantly.",1400378503

Adhering to rigorous coding standards, static analysis, deep understanding of the program structure at hand goes a long way in the software engineering field. Not every programmer (or coder) does that, so not every programmer is an engineer.<p>Of course, going to school for an EECS degree also should instill such values, including engineering ethics and codes of conduct.",1400378502

Some work, some don&#x27;t; but generally speaking, they did improve compensation and arrangements for the profession.<p>The problems of the writing world are well documented, and mostly common to other creative fields: oversupply, intrinsic difficulty in quality judgement, and output that can be hard to monetise.
