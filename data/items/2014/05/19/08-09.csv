Under this restriction, states can go almost nuclear.<p>The tech and materials for civilian and military nuclear use is similar enough that a country that can do power independently would be able to produce bombs within 2-5 years. Some countries have a &quot;threshold strategy&quot; where they stay within the bounds of the treaty but maintain an ability to withdraw and make up ground as quickly as possible.

7766433,comment,7765332,7765332,1,0,chipsy,,,"You can see this as a kind of progression of the supplement industry, one where the delivery stands a better chance of matching the promise: For example, Coca-Cola and Milo both marketed themselves as a form of &quot;medicine&quot; or &quot;health food&quot; early on, and then only later reworked their image as they became more evidently unhealthful to the public. And bodybuilding supplements have their own extremely checkered history[0]. Over time the categories of supplements with actual nutritional value have stuck it out in the market as they&#x27;ve proven themselves.<p>So I see Soylent as another step forward - the necessary food processing to make these kinds of sophisticated supplement blends has gotten cheaper and more widely available with time, enabling more experiments.<p>So the news for the future looks promising. It&#x27;ll probably get cheaper. The nutritional value is likely to go upwards in future versions as more data is uncovered.

For many of these, the progress is pretty slow - starting with simple type inference, lambdas. OCaml has imperative/OO features but it is still an ML language. As other languages adopt many of the ML features they will retain their roots of course. But I&#x27;d like to think they&#x27;ll accumulate all of the good parts of an ML language (pattern matching, better inference). It&#x27;s possible that my belief that ML languages are far superior to popular languages could be influencing my outlook. But even after many years of programming in terrible languages like Java it&#x27;s clear within a week of programming in OCaml/ML that so many problems that require &quot;architecting&quot; in Java/ObjC/C++ are just trivial chains of functions and pattern matching in OCaml.

In 2007, the year before CERN first powered up the LHC, the lab produced 142 master&#x27;s and Ph.D. theses, according to the lab&#x27;s document server. Last year it produced 327. (Fermilab chipped in 54.) That abundance seems unlikely to vanish anytime soon, as last year ATLAS had 1000 grad students and CMS had 900.<p>In contrast, the INSPIRE Web site, a database for particle physics, currently lists 124 postdocs worldwide in experimental high-energy physics, the sort of work LHC grads have trained for.<p>The situation is equally difficult for postdocs trying to make the jump to a junior faculty position or a permanent job at a national lab. The Snowmass Young Physicists survey received responses from 956 early-career researchers, including 343 postdocs. But INSPIRE currently lists just 152 &quot;junior&quot; positions, including 61 in North America. And the supply of jobs isn&#x27;t likely to increase, says John Finley, an astrophysicist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who is leading a search to replace two senior particle physicists.<p>&quot;How should we make it attractive for them [young people] to spend 5,6,7 years in our field, be satisfied, learn about excitement, but finally be qualified to find other possibilities?&quot; -- H. Schopper<p>Indeed, even while giving complete satisfaction, they have no forward vision about the possibility of pursuing a career at CERN.<p>This lack of an element of social responsibility in the contract policy is unacceptable. Rather than serve as a cushion of laziness for supervisors, who often have only a limited and utilitarian view when defining the opening of an IC post, the contract policy must ensure the inclusion of an element of social justice, which is cruelly absent today.<p><a href=""http://staff-association.web.cern.ch/content/unsatisfactory-contract-policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staff-association.web.cern.ch/content/unsatisfactory-...</a><p>The long-held but erroneous assumption of never-ending rapid growth in biomedical science has created an unsustainable hypercompetitive system that is discouraging even the most outstanding prospective students from entering our profession—and making it difficult for seasoned investigators to produce their best work. This is a recipe for long-term decline, and the problems cannot be solved with simplistic approaches. Instead, it is time to confront the dangers at hand and rethink some fundamental features of the US biomedical research ecosystem.<p><a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/04/09/1404402111"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/04/09/1404402111</a><p>Since 1982, almost 800,000 PhDs were awarded in science and engineering (S&E) fields, whereas only about 100,000 academic faculty positions were created in those fields within the same time frame. The number of S&E PhDs awarded annually has also increased over this time frame, from ~19,000 in 1982 to ~36,000 in 2011. The number of faculty positions created each year, however, has not changed, with roughly 3,000 new positions created annually.<p><a href=""http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n10/full/nbt.2706.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v31/n10/full/nbt.2706.html</a><p>One is simply that graduate students represent the cheapest form of labor, and so graduate programs have expanded to keep researchers well supplied. The end result is that 8,000 people get a PhD in the biological sciences each year, far more than can ever hope to find faculty positions. Only about 20 percent of them end up staying in research positions, yet graduate education generally provides training in nothing but research.<p>The problem is that everybody who would actually implement these reforms at the institutional level won&#x27;t like them. Successful researchers will have to accept smaller and more focused labs and see their smaller pool of grad students distracted by training in areas other than research. University administrators will see their departments and incoming money both shrink.

This paper (<a href=""http://jmt.swjtu.edu.cn/EN/abstract/abstract8587.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jmt.swjtu.edu.cn/EN/abstract/abstract8587.shtml</a>) looks at the <i>incompressible</i> flow case... but that&#x27;s kind of missing the point I think.",1400487752

7766315,comment,7764468,7764468,11,0,jordwalke,,,"A couple of people have asked why you might choose OCaml over other languages. I&#x27;ve not done as much OCaml work as others on this thread (I work primarily on ReactJS (Facebook/Instagram&#x27;s) functional UI framework), but I can offer a different perspective as someone who is outside of the OCaml community, but asking the same questions. Here are some of my personal findings.<p>I&#x27;ll narrow any comparison down to the ML family of languages. Java/C++/ and many other languages are just now beginning their slow, but inevitable evolution into <i>becoming</i> a dialect of ML (which IMHO is a sort of admission of the ML/functional family superiority).<p>Once you embrace the power of pattern matching, it&#x27;s hard to use anything but an ML family language (StandardML/Haskell/F#/OCaml). I would program in any one of those languages over Java/C++/Objective-C/JS.<p>Practical reasons why you might choose OCaml:<p>- OCaml&#x27;s records aren&#x27;t as elegant as SML&#x27;s but OCaml has labeled arguments with optional default values which can satisfy many of the reasons why you&#x27;d use records as arguments in the first place (and may be even more powerful in some cases).<p>- Two modes of compilation (fast native executable XOR fast compilation). Who doesn&#x27;t like options.<p>- All the benchmarks I can find show that OCaml is very fast (around as fast as C++).<p>- Excellent JS target and and apparent commitment to maintaining it (as someone building a JS library, this is very important to me) (and as someone who wants to build apps and be able to instantly share them with everyone in the world.)<p>- Someone has built an autocomplete plugin for Vim/Emacs (merlin). (&quot;VimBox&quot; (<a href=""https://github.com/jordwalke/VimBox/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jordwalke/VimBox/</a>) has configured it to complete as you type - like in Visual Studio etc.)<p>- On very rare occasion, you&#x27;ll run into a problem that is inherently better suited to OO (dynamic dispatch). I can usually find a way to solve it with functors/modules, but it&#x27;s nice to know that you have OO in your back pocket in case you ever need it. It&#x27;s also nice to know you probably won&#x27;t have to.<p>- Finally, a common package manager (OPAM) is becoming standard. I look forward to seeing how OPAM helps make the new dev experience and the code-sharing/development experience seamless.<p>- The module system is very powerful (SML&#x27;s). Haskell does not have this, and strangely F# dropped it. (I hear, Haskell&#x27;s type classes fulfill similar roles (but with more sugar)).<p>- There&#x27;s usually ocamlyacc grammars for most languages. Most examples of languages, type systems, parsers are already in OCaml (or ML). It&#x27;s a nice (but small) perk.<p>- Predictability. OCaml is not lazy by default. Lazy computations could become problematic for low-latency applications (such as UIs) if a lot of computation becomes is deferred until the moment a final dependency has been satisfied, but by that time you may be close to your screen refresh deadline and it may lead to a dropped frame. It would have been better to have been computing while waiting for a final dependency. I&#x27;m not sure if Haskell (a lazy language) has had this problem. You can opt into laziness in OCaml if you would like to.<p>- Mutability. I feel strange saying this, as such a huge proponent of immutability, but sometimes you just need to hack something in place, mutate some state and come back to clean it up later. (You can still use monads in OCaml).<p>- Tagged Variants (no need to predeclare variants, just pattern match on them and OCaml ensures that only properly matched values ever make their way into that expression).<p>- Industry use is growing. OCaml is used here at Facebook and many other places as mentioned.<p>- There are many abstractions to choose from (Records, Objects, Modules, Functors, First Class Modules, GADTs, ...).<p>OCaml Cons:\n- There are many abstractions to choose from (Records, Objects, Modules, Functors, First Class Modules, GADTs, ...).<p>(Edited for formatting)",1400487499

It appears that Google is trying to depreciate inter-site linking in general, and skilled PR misdirection on the topic by a Google employee doesn&#x27;t reassure.<p>One has to wonder to what extent the entire phenomenon of link spamming sites might be a Hegelian Dialectic tactic by Google - ie a manufactured problem, intended to prompt a &#x27;solution&#x27; that is in fact more beneficial to Google&#x27;s unstated intent. Are we really to believe that there&#x27;s no algorithmic solution to mitigating the link-spamming nuisance?<p>Another dimension of this same ambition, is the movement to obfuscate URLs in browser address bars.
