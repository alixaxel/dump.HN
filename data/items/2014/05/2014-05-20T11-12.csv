If you want to automate the process, the first thing you&#x27;ll think about is how to change that technology to make things easier for automation. Is it actually possible to turn a container ship into lego bricks which can be easily swapped out when broken, and can it be made hot swappable from the ship inside?<p>Imagine a car which would monitor each of its parts, diagnose an issue on the gearbox, and turn it offline <i>while driving</i> to replace it.",1400587165

I&#x27;ve had a lot of issues that I wouldn&#x27;t have had if I was using a GNU/Linux distro like Debian.  Major issues with GCC after certain updates, outdated GNU software like bash, brew is barely acceptable as a package manager (can&#x27;t hold a candle to dpkg/apt), and I have to go to websites to get the installers for most big programs (Emacs, Firefox, others) like I&#x27;m using Windows anyway.  I don&#x27;t like like the desktop environment, either.  The window manager is subpar and the virtual desktops are lacking compared to what you get with most GNU/Linux DEs.<p>I know that a lot of people disagree with me because I see developers with macbooks all the time, but imo OS X is not a good environment for hackers on a purely technical level (ignoring the issues of proprietary software).",1400587056

Much of management theory assumes that employees are passive, like cattle, and that the employee will cluelessly make nothing of the manager who&#x27;s &quot;documenting&quot;. In reality, that puts the person into war mode.<p>The old phrase about never pulling a gun unless you intend to kill someone? It also applies to HR practices and &quot;documenting&quot;. You only do that if you&#x27;re sure you&#x27;re going to fire someone as quickly as you can, because there&#x27;s absolutely no way to turn back once down that road. The best route is to fire same-day with a generous severance, but most middle-managers don&#x27;t have that leeway (either to fire quickly or to give severances). Which gets to the crux of why being a middle manager sucks so hard. You have major responsibilities (hiring, firing, defining and canceling projects) but none of the power to do them properly. You often get stuck between self-serving, arrogant executives (MacLeod Sociopaths) and checked-out minimum-effort players (MacLeod Losers) and can very easily be cleaning up the messes of both.",1400585522

If possible, actually template the document too.<p>Yes, single page apps are faster (because of the joke called javascript loading ... yes there&#x27;s async, but it&#x27;s broken, and you can load a script to load other scripts, but really ...). Except for when they load. Then there&#x27;s a trip to your server, a trip to the CDN for the Javascript, then another trip to your server to get the document you wanted.<p>Inlining the JSON saves 1 trip. Having the document already prepared saves another (since most browsers will render before the Javascript at the bottom).<p>You won&#x27;t notice running on localhost. It probably works ok on a good connection, if you&#x27;re located in the same timezone. But with 200ms latency (on a mobile) and two round trips (plus your initial get) it makes a difference.
