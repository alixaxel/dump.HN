I got an accountant through a referral who guided me  through the entire S corp setup, and the whole invoicing/tax stuff. It&#x27;s really not that complicated, and I could probably do it myself, but he just sends me documents to sign and mail to IRS/State/Unemployment/whatever. Worth every dime.<p>I primarily write Java/J2EE code and the demand seems to be very high for that type of work. I have been on my current contract for over 2 years, and keep getting significant raises every 6 months when they renew my contract because they know I have domain knowledge and finding competent people is hard and expensive. My advice is to leverage your connections so that you can bill directly as possible. This is sometimes hard to do with vendor management systems at big companies, but if you&#x27;re able to talk to the hiring manager directly, you can avoid the recruiter middle man and get $15 - $30 + more on your rate, which is huge.<p>In my opinion, if you really like to code and can produce quality stuff efficiently, you owe it to yourself to look into it. Times are good, you should get paid what the market will bear for your skills. In my case, I was able to triple my income in about 2 years. I was scared a bit at first, but the way the job market is right now at the very worst <i>someone</i> will pay you to do <i>something</i> . You can always go be an employee again. I have had 0 gaps in work thus far.<p>Trying to get to a point where there is not a linear correlation with my time and money, which will obviously require a different approach .

7823103,comment,7821854,7822802,2,0,sliverstorm,,,"To my understanding, the critical difference between framebuffer graphics and 3D API graphics is the processing! In a framebuffer scenario, the CPU does all the rendering. Since CPU is poorly suited to rendering 3D, we have a coprocessor called a GPU. The CPU has to feed the GPU work.<p>Because the GPU is cutting-edge, there is a certain amount of magic voodoo required for top performance that needs to get abstracted away- maybe this <i>particular</i> model of GPU you have doesn&#x27;t support some common instruction. You don&#x27;t want to handle that in your software, you want to hide that in the driver.<p>Beyond that, the API is also there to make the GPU easier to use. OpenGL is a mess, sure, but to my understanding most developers would pull their hair out and give up if they had to program the GPU directly.",1401472535

But there are other keyboard reasons.<p>For example, iOS7 totally broke the keyboard so that fast touch-typists just can&#x27;t type on it any more. This doesn&#x27;t matter on something small like a phone, but on an iPad it is super-frustrating. Apple fixed it somewhat in recent updates but it&#x27;s still broken in a few basic ways, all having to do with the fact that the person who programmed the new keyboard doesn&#x27;t know how typing works.<p>It is confusing enough that a non-power-user probably doesn&#x27;t have a clear idea why typing sucks now, they just know that letters don&#x27;t come out with the right capitals any more, sometimes extra spaces show up, and damn that shift key is confusing. etc. It is not so much &quot;Android is better&quot; as it is &quot;iOS is not a nice experience any more&quot;.<p>There are similar things to do with web browsing. Web browsing is supposed to be one of the few things these devices specialize in, but on my iPad Air it is terrible. If I go to a web site with images on it and scroll down, most of the images don&#x27;t load for a <i>LONG</i> time, leaving me with mainly a blank page. When iOS7 came out the browser crashed <i>all</i> the damn time. Now that is mostly fixed but it still crashes sometimes.<p>Meanwhile there are all these timing-based gestures that are thrown off by browser performance problems, leading to bad user experiences. For example, I want to scroll down a page, so I press on the screen, drag, and release. Well oops, some piece of JavaScript ran right then or something, causing the browser&#x27;s timing to get confused (maybe it counts frames and only a couple of frames went by), so instead of a drag it interprets this as a tap, which for some reason causes me to select some garbage on the page that I don&#x27;t care about. Well now I am in select mode and things get only more confusing from there (especially if more performance hitches are happening). This happens all the time.<p>When you can&#x27;t even scroll down a web page reliably, and yet that is one of the main use cases you are selling your product for, you can&#x27;t claim it is a luxury product. You aren&#x27;t delivering a luxury experience so you can&#x27;t charge a premium.<p>Apple has gotten away with this in the past, in similar situations, though, because of newness and shininess. As Marc Andreesen pointed out recently, for the first few years you could barely even make a call on an iPhone, and when you did it was super-frustrating. But still it caught on. I think this is just because it was so new and exciting and there weren&#x27;t real competitors yet. Once the bloom is off that rose, in order to be perceived as a premium brand, you have to actually deliver quality. But Apple is not delivering quality with the OS, they are just delivering some kind of skin-deep attempt of an appearance of quality.<p>I consider iOS7 to be a huge misstep and a giant missed opportunity, much bigger even than Siri or Maps. I am not sure if fixing iOS7 would solve all Apple&#x27;s problems, but it is where I would start.<p><i>However</i>, I don&#x27;t think the thesis of this article -- lack of UI features -- would be my first step. Because I don&#x27;t agree with the article that iOS 7 is simple. In reality it&#x27;s a mess, it just tries to appear simple. So the first step is making it really, actually simple, and make it deliver a solid, quality experience.

7823000,comment,7815606,7816145,1,0,gcr,,,"I&#x27;m a simple customer.<p>My finances are strange. As a student supported primarily through research grants/TAships, at the beginning of the semester, I have my entire paycheck for half of a year deposited into my account. This makes my budgeting problematic: my &quot;total account balance&quot; would show far more than what I would like to allocate myself for each month. I don&#x27;t want to get out the pen-and-paper or Emacs&#x27; calc just to see whether I could go out to dinner that night.<p>Here&#x27;s how Simple addresses this: A giant &quot;Safe-to-spend&quot; number is shown at the top of every page on the website. This &quot;Safe-to-spend&quot; number is defined as your total account balance minus the amount you&#x27;ve allocated to &quot;spending goals&quot;, which are tags/buckets that contain money, similar to an old envelope accounting system.<p>When I&#x27;m paid for half the year, I move all of the balance to a &quot;Stipend&quot; goal and never touch it again. My Safe-to-spend now shows as $0.<p>Every month, I manually log in and move a monthly amount out of the &quot;Stipend&quot; goal/bucket and into my &quot;Safe-to-spend.&quot; I then treat that as my &quot;monthly paycheck&quot;, and then allocate that money to goals such as &quot;Rent&quot;, &quot;Cell phone bill&quot;, &quot;Food&quot;, and etc., usually leaving a few hundred dollars in my safe-to-spend as a margin and so I can watch how my finances change on a small scale.<p>When it&#x27;s time to pay rent, the transaction hits my Simple account. This makes my &quot;Safe-to-spend&quot; immediately drop to 0 (really negative), indicating that I&#x27;ve spent some money that should have been allocated to goals. When I notice this, I log in and tag the big rent transaction as &quot;Rent&quot;, which empties out the &quot;Rent&quot; bucket and pushes the Safe-To-Spend back to positive.<p>It&#x27;s a great way of planning my spending in advance, which is one of the philosophies behind using these tools.<p>Some other things that make me feel like Simple genuinely wants to avoid screwing over customers:<p>- Excellent same-day customer support (I have something like 20 conversations open at the moment);\n- No overdraft problems, because Simple will just reject transactions if you do not have the money for them (this even applies if you use your card as a credit card transaction--if you want to be strict, you can also make it reject transactions that would drain your Safe-to-spend but I don&#x27;t do this);\n- Planning tools that encourage planning large purchases before you make them. (Example: I allocate 10% of my paycheck to a &quot;Tithe&quot; goal, for personal reasons. After doing this, I realize that was able to help a family member during a time of emergency without having to stress about making next month&#x27;s rent since I already had this money set aside for this purpose.)<p>Some problems that make Simple less attractive for serious people:<p>- Low interest. I earned something like a buck of interest all last year. If you&#x27;re serious about passive income, Simple might not be a good choice for you. (I&#x27;m a student. Maybe some day, but I don&#x27;t want to be a miser quite yet)\n- I do not have check-writing privileges. If I want to send money to someone, I have to log into their website and fill out a form. Then, an elf in the &quot;Simple Factory&quot; in Portland or whatever will physically print off a check, hand-seal it into a plain white envelope, and put it in the mail to the address I indicated.\n- You can only put one name on the account, so if you&#x27;re married, you and your spouse can&#x27;t share your finances. (If you&#x27;re both simple customers, you can send money back and forth though, which isn&#x27;t so bad)<p>But frankly, I don&#x27;t mind these things. Their pitch is &quot;We make banking not painful again,&quot; and their tools and customer service far outweigh these drawbacks.<p>As a spending account, Simple will only be significantly helpful to you if you jump in completely and use everything they offer, making Simple your primary spending account. This is a hard pill to swallow for many people since they&#x27;re already established as roughly-happy customers of other banks. I definitely would recommend Simple to someone who&#x27;s just starting out in the &quot;real world&quot; who wants to learn how money works and get familiar with budgeting.<p>(Sorry if this sounded like an advertisement. Maybe it is, in a way.)",1401471303

We have multiple ARM implementations in CPU space, we have two vendors x86 CPUs, we have all kinds of wireless cards, but assembly on one ARM core better run on another, your x86 binary better run on ARM or Intel chips unless you use vendor specific extensions, and your wireless radio better process inbound data properly regardless of the sender.<p>I think the real problem is that in the massively parallel pipeline architecture space (aka, gpus, but they are more than just graphics processors anymore) is that they aren&#x27;t treated like proper programmable computers. What we should have are compilers to build ASM binaries for each architecture, and sane ISAs.<p>That would mean in the present tense you would need Intel: preSB, SB, IVB, Haswell, Broadwell, Skylake, etc compilers. I&#x27;ve never read their ISA documentation, so I don&#x27;t know which of these have common core so that you could treat it like a CPU - ie, base instruction set with extensions like SSE or NEON. I do imagine though if we weren&#x27;t working at such an absurdly high level, we would see graphics hardware conform to the same model as CPUs - common ISA, with multiple implementations.<p>I guess the problem there is that the way all modern ISAs are handled is ridiculous and stupid. Intel &quot;owns&quot; x86, ARM &quot;owns&quot; itself, etc. The reason we don&#x27;t have reasonable CPU competition is that you don&#x27;t just compete in hardware implementation, you either need to pay extortion to use what is effectively the same API - the same ISA - and that is one of the strengths of the graphics industry. The effective ISA that software is built against is predominantly open (most GPU code is openGL, despite how many directX games there are). We can see the difference - very little hardware runs DirectX because they have to pay MS the privilege to support it, and then it isn&#x27;t even a standard at all so you can&#x27;t use it on anything but Windows. It is congruent with proprietary ISAs for cpus.<p>An example of a non-proprietary ISA is SPARC. I&#x27;ve never really looked into how good an ISA it actually is, but it is royalty free unless you want to use the branding - you can implement your own SPARC cpus without paying jack, the way it should be.<p>So like I said, what we really need is a common open ISA for hardware graphics accelerators to implement, and then independently develop extensions for that can be proposed and adopted into the mainstream standard. And if that standard ever becomes overly bloated, any vendor can develop their own newer base to handle newer paradigms or fix bloat, the same way we see programming languages go.<p>If I didn&#x27;t have to figure out how to eat or didn&#x27;t have another dozen things I&#x27;d want to do, I&#x27;d definitely want to see what I could manage writing a binary compiler for the SI ISA from AMD and seeing how performant you could make some other high level graphics language with compiled binaries. That is kind of what they did with Mantle, but their continued showing of not making any effort to open that language up to standardization or even just publishing it at all shows that it certainly won&#x27;t be the answer.",1401470919

Another service can pick up on the same task, which you then point to the same endpoints to continue.  If you know how to use git and your host directly, great.  If you don&#x27;t, who cares, these services take care of it for you as a transparent endpoint.<p>In fact you could even charge money for this kind of thing.  Or even make it more open ended than just blogs and web pages, but that&#x27;s where my thinking got jumbled on this idea and I only got as far as buying a domain for it.<p>Obviously sites like medium and everyone else would never do this, because it means you can leave their platform immediately.

When I started out programming the Linux kernel, I thought I had to understand everything and I hated the book for not going into detail on how things worked. But really, I just had to start changing code and running it, and I became a Linux kernel programmer. Now I see that I just needed to know the basic roadmap, and the rest comes from reading code and experimentation. It doesn&#x27;t matter much if the book is a little outdated; the core concepts stay in place for a while. Another book I&#x27;d recommend starting with is The Linux Programming Interface. You can write programs for a while without getting to the kernel/userspace boundary, but this is essential to understand if you&#x27;re going to write user-facing code (e.g., a driver).<p>It&#x27;s just like the article said--just a big, annoying to debug C program. If you understand pointers, you can learn how to program the Linux kernel. Programming in the Linux kernel has been a really fun learning experience for me. It&#x27;s nice, if intimidating, how you can just do everything--there are no hard abstraction boundaries, you can read all the source and call into any part of the kernel without going through hoops.<p>I&#x27;ve developed the Linux kernel with two machines, a development machine and a headless machine that I&#x27;m ssh&#x27;ing into (actually, a bunch of those--makes testing go faster). VMs aren&#x27;t really an option for device drivers, but if you run your code on your development machine, you waste a lot of time.",1401470652

Opening up the API for any app to eat up even more real estate would, in my opinion, be extremely misguided. If anything it needs to be dumbed down even further.<p>There are two separate concerns here:<p>1. Notifications. Telling me that things have happened, when they happen. The notification center could (nay, should) excel at this, but currently it&#x27;s only doing <i>okay</i>. I wish I didn&#x27;t have to keep micromanaging my preferences to prevent apps from spamming me with useless stuff, but at least it works.<p>2. Persistent info. Stocks, weather, headlines, deadlines, etc. I don&#x27;t want this stuff in the notification center. It gets in the way of everything coming at me from concern #1. I want to be able to find this elsewhere, without having to dig down into each app. And I definitely don&#x27;t want apps trying to tell me persistent info in the form of a notification. I don&#x27;t need to be notified that it&#x27;s sunny out, or that something interesting (but not directly related to me, or actionable on my part) happened inside of one of my apps. But having to drill down into each individual app for this info is also a pain.<p>This is where I love Microsoft&#x27;s live tiles. The ability to peek inside of an app from the homescreen is awesome (way better than having to add separate widgets, a la Android, each with their own design patterns and set of controls). I&#x27;d use Windows Phone for this reason if it had the same app ecosystem as iOS, but of course I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to. Currently my primary device is running Android, which, for me, is a nice trade-off between app availability and base OS experience. But if iOS were to add that ability to &quot;peek&quot; into any existing app to see what&#x27;s happening, I&#x27;d definitely consider switching back.",1401470498

The best selling triple A games have deep multiplayer experiences that can suck gamers in for 40 to over 100 hours.  When a gamer plays one game for 100 hours instead of 10 games for 10 hours that means they&#x27;re buying far fewer games.<p>Then, even if you make a game witha  good multiplayer element, you&#x27;re still struggling against the tide because you need a big enough player population to keep players engaged.  It&#x27;s the network effect working against you.  If all of a given gamer&#x27;s friends are playing Call of Duty they&#x27;re less likely to invest in the multiplayer of another game.  Or when they do go to another MP game and there aren&#x27;t many players available for matchmaking, they just give up and move on.<p>The point was well made in this article that what needs to happen is that the game dev industry needs to set more sane goals and sane budgets.  There&#x27;s not a lot of room for games with $30+ million budgets because of the amount of copies that would have to be sold and the fact that gamers only have so much time to play.

Most of us probably wouldn&#x27;t consider working 50-60 hours/week for someone else who can ruin everything with a few bad decisions and reaps most of the profits. Find out what works best for you and your ideas and don&#x27;t be afraid.",1401469430
7822845,comment,7819586,7819586,1,0,wuliwong,,,"I get super jazzed by everything SpaceX does, this was no different.<p>My one question was about the idea that it could just refuel and take off again. I see two issues. First, it appears that it sustains some pretty significant damage upon re-entry, I&#x27;m guessing there are probably some repairs needed before relaunching. Second, it seems to launch with some sort of first stage rocket which is detached and presumably is lost or at very least, dropped into an ocean with a parachute? So, although the Dragon can land anywhere, it still needs this other stage to be recovered and attached. With regards to reusability, it doesn&#x27;t appear to be a huge leap beyond the space shuttle.<p>I&#x27;m sure the process of repairing, reattaching, and refueling are more efficient with the dragon v2 vs the space shuttle but the presentation making the specific claim that the dragon v2 just needs to be refueled and it can launch again seemed false.",1401469429

7822832,comment,7822233,7822580,1,0,paulyg,,,"I agree with your assessment. To me the reason we keep ping-pnging between the two extremes is a lack of standardized and common caching mechanism. In a perfect world every web server would be behind an HTTP reverse proxy and we could just use HTTP headers to control caching. But there are a lot of quirks to that so unless you control the whole stack you don&#x27;t have a proxy out front. And then you get into all other kinds of caching schemes: filesystem, memcache, redis, s3/cloudfront, etc. Which one you choose is determined by your tech stack, your PaaS, etc. Which the CMS creators have limited control over. If caching was a no brainer CMS creators could just concentrate on making the dynamic part good.",1401469232
