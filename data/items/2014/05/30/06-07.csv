7820606,comment,7808379,7808379,1,0,vtd,,,"In 2003 our school still had a class with old machines what should boot from a ROM into some BASIC environment. I was actively reading books on computers at that moment, however, without any access to the hardware, so I was using any available option to walk into that room and to fix errors in someone&#x27;s code. Then we started learning graphics, and I actually tried to draw something on a sheet of paper with 1x1 mm cells and then code it by putting points in these places. Other folks did strange things too --- the pixels in the displays were not exactly square, so someone tried to make a circle out of points, adjusting them so that it looked more round than the standard one.<p>A year after the school bought about a dozen Windows machines and the fun was over (just until we figured out some ways of obtaining admin rights there and doing strange things like renaming all computers to what look like &quot;COMP-12&quot; (all these letters are present in the Russian locale, so unique same-looking names are possible)).",1401433063

While it&#x27;d be great if they can attend these parties, it&#x27;s not practical, even if they are within the same country.<p>- Companies do throw/host a lot of meetups to attract top coders. Top coders are usually kept very happy by their current employers and not looking to leave so they don&#x27;t usually attend recruiting functions unless they are the ones recruiting.<p>- If you want to see parties thrown as recruiting events, go to Uncubed in SF. It&#x27;s a wonderful time, but most people are just entering into the industry, so not many senior level guys.<p>- <i></i>* Most programmers I meet at my workplace thought the interview was pretty easy, to which I say &quot;Of course you did, you&#x27;re here, but think about the 30-40 candidates before you that failed miserably.&quot; I meet a lot of skilled programmers that hate coding tests/interviews, the reason? They already know they can do the job, they know they&#x27;re gonna ace the interview because they&#x27;re awesome. But guess what? A lot, and I mean a lot, of people that fail thought the same.<p>- Don&#x27;t discount social skills. Some roles are more client facing than others, or working with non-technical folks. Communication is key to projects.<p>I think any programmer that&#x27;s been a hiring manager will agree there are many senior level people that just can&#x27;t code,entry level grads with CS degrees that can&#x27;t write algorithms or figure out time complexity.<p>Just my point of view.",1401432847

7820596,comment,7819413,7819413,0,0,jrockway,,,"This is the worst analogy I&#x27;ve ever read about hiring.<p>Carpentry is much different from programming.  If you&#x27;re building a subdivision, you&#x27;re not building 500 unique houses.  You build one, then you build an almost-exact copy.  But here&#x27;s where it diverges from programming: you don&#x27;t get to copy it, you have to follow the exact same steps again.  You&#x27;re not building a machine to build houses and then have it build 500 houses.  You&#x27;re just repeating the exact same thing 500 times.<p>So for hiring a carpenter, a lot of things that don&#x27;t make sense when hiring programmers makes sense.  For example, if you like house 1 of 500, you can probably hire the same team sight unseen to build house 2 of 500.  All they&#x27;re going to do is the exact same thing they did on the first house, leaving very little room to mess something up unexpectedly.  They&#x27;ll probably do a better job, just from having done it before.<p>Programming is not like that, because we can reuse code, we almost never solve the exact same problem over and over.  We are always coming up with a more abstract problem to solve, because the foundation exists for doing so.  (Say you&#x27;re making two websites.  You write the first one.  What do you do for the second one?  Cut-n-paste-and-modify?  I hope not.  What you probably end up with is a mini web framework and two things that use that.  This makes website 3 even easier than website 2, and website 4 easier than that.  That&#x27;s why we call it engineering and not carpentry.)<p>Another factor that comes into play with programming is deciding when to build a machine to build houses and when to just build a house.  That&#x27;s &quot;experience&quot;.<p>(A more appropriate analogy might be civil engineering.  Civil engineers don&#x27;t build machines to build bridges, they build bridges, because while a lot of things are similar between individual bridges, a lot of things are different too.  Civil engineers abstract the components of the bridge, of course; they&#x27;re not milling I beams or fasteners or developing new types of concretes from scratch for every bridge.  That&#x27;s like libraries that programmers use.  But they are also doing engineering -- what&#x27;s the right material  and right type of structure for the given design constraints?  Similarly, it would not be strange to ask a civil engineer if she&#x27;s ever used concrete when you&#x27;re planning on building an interstate highway.  It would also not be strange to set up an example structure and do some load and material calculations on the whiteboard.  While being able to do those calculations doesn&#x27;t mean she&#x27;s a good engineer, not being able to do those calculations would be pretty strange.  I don&#x27;t know much about civil engineering, but I hope this analogy at least makes a little sense to other laymen.)",1401432731

It was one of the best choices I could have made.<p>I grew up in a small desert town with not much room to grow. The opportunities there were limited for what I wanted to do, and I knew that if I was still living in that town when I was 40, or even 30, I wouldn&#x27;t be happy.<p>Being the procrastinator that I am, I knew that I had to take action immediately, or I would inevitably fall into a lull of complacence: a mediocre job, a girlfriend, a dog? And then I would be stuck; eternally glued to this town that I hated by second-rate obligations. (Not entirely true, people make drastic changes even with other obligations all the time, but it&#x27;s not common.)<p>I was (and still am) young, and I believe that you should take as many calculated risks as possible when you&#x27;re young. Do it before you have a mortgage, a spouse, a kid. It&#x27;s so much easier then, because failing doesn&#x27;t mean letting your child go hungry, or losing your home and living on the streets. Worst case, you have to move back in with your parents (assuming they&#x27;re supportive).<p>When I&#x27;m laying on my deathbed and analyzing my life, I would rather regret trying and failing to achieve my dreams than regret not trying at all. When it gets right down to it, I don&#x27;t think I would regret failing one bit. Failure is part of life, and since I&#x27;ve moved here I&#x27;ve failed plenty of times. Probably more times than I&#x27;ve succeeded. But the value of my few successes outweighs my many failures, and that&#x27;s the key.<p>I&#x27;ve gotten a good job, learned and grown more than I would have imagined possible, met dozens of amazing people, made lifelong friends, co-founded an organization, and I&#x27;m happier than I&#x27;ve ever been. Not only that, but I&#x27;m excited for the future.<p>I&#x27;ve still got a long way to go, but I&#x27;m so glad that I had the courage and drive to go out of my comfort zone, into a completely foreign situation, all alone, and just do it. Granted, I was extremely lucky to have the full support of my parents and family, but even if I hadn&#x27;t I think I still would have gone out and done it.<p>Of course, this is not advice for everyone. It&#x27;s not really advice at all, just my own experience. Yours may vary. Best of luck.",1401431987
