You&#x27;re guaranteed to turn a profit every single year.  Gate tickets, TV contracts, merchandise, and profit sharing are all very good revenue source for a sports team.  He also doesn&#x27;t have to pay money to build a new arena because Clippers just pay rent to play at Staples Center.<p>Sports is one of the few businesses that will thrive under any economic condition. There will always be fans that shell out money to watch their team.",1401425993

They&#x27;ll probably get to keep Paul and Griffin now that Sterling is gone, and due to the Lakers being bad they have a massive market to tap into.<p>Yeah they won&#x27;t be worth more than his investment any time soon, but in 20 years? That&#x27;s not out of the question. Not to mention unless you are Donald Sterling or someone like him you don&#x27;t usually buy a team to make money, you buy it cause there are only 30 other people in the world that get to do it.

Fast food can also contain vegetables, live cultures, and various assortment of ingredients which are good for you. Overindulgence of anything is bad, fast food just makes it easier because it&#x27;s easy to get, generally tastes good and is packed with a ton of calories. If you ate fast food very carefully, then you&#x27;d probably be okay.<p>Furthermore, there probably isn&#x27;t a simple shortcut to nutrition. If you want to be healthy you need to be involved in what you eat.<p>I&#x27;m sure the driving force for Soylent is profit as well, otherwise they would have done years of testing and scientific studies, before releasing a mix of chemicals as a solution to food.

Slavery hasn&#x27;t been institutionalized to the same degree in mainland Europe as it was in the US since Roman times - of course it wasn&#x27;t absent because of colonialism, but nor was it ever so prevalent as to dominate local economies the way it did in the US. Class, gender, and property ownership were greater legal barriers to suffrage in most European countries than ethnic origin, and over a much longer timeframe - the Third Reich being the major exception to this trend.<p>By contrast, in the US you had people systematically excluded from exercising the vote within the last 50 years, which is comparatively recent. I think the politicization of race has resulted in a great many misconceptions all across the political spectrum, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you can just pay it some lip service and call the problem solved.<p>I can find you equally obnoxious casual racism from the right, or you could just read the comments on American newspaper articles.
