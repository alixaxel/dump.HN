In them, I figure out what I really want to do, and whether I have the tools to do what I really want to do.  I applied to YC&#x27;s first class of S05, as I was finishing up college.  I didn&#x27;t get in.  I figured that if investors wouldn&#x27;t talk to me, I&#x27;d learn how to do a bootstrapped startup, so I went to work for a bootstrapped financial software startup.  After 2 years there, I quit and founded my own bootstrapped startup, this time in Web 2.0 casual games.  It failed too.  In examining the failure, I figured that I lacked enough real-world experience to understand what the real markets were, I&#x27;d exhausted my pool of potential co-founders, and I had this continuing anxiety about how to do software development &quot;the right way&quot; and make programs that scale.  So I moved out to California to work for Google Search.  I&#x27;m on my own again, but I got everything out of Google that I hoped to get out of it (and more!).<p>If you&#x27;re doing it right, each job is an opportunity to get a lot more than money.

Stocks are a medium to high risk investment with no guaranteed return on investment. It&#x27;s actually pretty hard to make an educated guess what the return would be. But we can give it a go. According to this analysis,<p><pre><code>   the nominal compound annual return of the Dow from\n   year-end 1900 to year-end 2011, excluding dividends,\n   was 4.75%.\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s actually pretty good and annihilates current CD rates (which hover around 2% for 5 year jumbos). Let&#x27;s run these numbers. According to my handy compound interest calculator, with a current principle of $0.00 (starting from scratch), adding $2,400/yr over 30 years, compounded annually at 4.75% gives me about $160,000. That&#x27;s actually pretty close to my inflationary upper bound calculated earlier!<p>But that&#x27;s also an upper bound.<p><pre><code>   However, the real compound annual growth was only\n   1.6%. That is, when we use constant dollars, we\n   discover that the purchasing power has only\n   increased 1.6% per year.\n</code></pre>\nSo we should actually run the numbers with 1.6% we end up with about $93,000. That&#x27;s great, but even with the miracle of compound interest, I&#x27;m not putting a dent in that $1.6 million.<p>Let&#x27;s get crazy, let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m a fantastic stock picker and I can beat all this and I&#x27;m making about 12% per year. Running the compound interest calculator, I get $650,000. That&#x27;s pretty amazing, but I still have about a million dollars to go to break even. I actually have to hit 16.5% every year, for 30 years, to break even.<p>This site lets us run another kind of calculation, the average rate of return for the S&P 500 over some date range. I picked the last 30 years and got 12.67% not adjusted for inflation and only 9.57% adjusted. Professional fund managers struggle to beat the S&P. So realistically, you aren&#x27;t going to either over the long run.</i>",1400871173

That shift is annoying if we expect everything to be laid out for us pre-digested. HN is designed to partly thwart that expectation. Why? Because we want thoughts and comments of substance. We want fiber.<p>It&#x27;s fashionable nowadays (or was until recently) to talk about opinionated design. One should know what a design is going for and what it&#x27;s <i>not</i> going for. Hacker News has always had an opinionated design. One part is: HN should be the kind of site that people who don&#x27;t want to be reflective find boring. [1]<p>You wrote something here that is fascinating:<p>> We all of us value substance and content, of course. (Need I really write that? Really? C&#x27;mon man.)<p>What&#x27;s fascinating is the &quot;of course&quot;. It seems so obviously true that we all value these innocuous things that it&#x27;s irritating even to have to say it. It&#x27;s such a cliché that it comes with a cliché rejoinder: &quot;But we are all of us limited in our time and attention&quot;.<p>But, on reflection, these seemingly obvious things are not true. We don&#x27;t all value intellectual substance—quite the contrary. We mostly value a stimulus-response reward cycle. We value having our preconceptions mirrored back to us. We value the <i>feeling</i> that we understand things (recognition) more than the effort of working through material in order partly to understand it. (This is also the dynamic at work in flamewars and ragefests, so the values of substance and civility are related.)<p>There can&#x27;t be many people who are free from this dynamic— certainly not here and certainly not me. But you can&#x27;t understand HN without knowing that it is an experiment in trying to grapple with this problem on the internet [2]. That&#x27;s what this site is. It doesn&#x27;t do it well, and is probably doomed, but the driving idea has always been, &quot;maybe we can stave off doom a bit longer&quot;.<p>1. When PG was showing me how to moderate HN he called this quality &quot;bookish&quot;.<p>2. <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/newswelcome.html</a>",1400870897

7790727,comment,7790065,7790065,30,0,Zelphyr,,,"This is close to my heart because its something I&#x27;ve dealt with since I was a child.  For 10 years I abated it with medication and that worked quite well.  Except for the side effects that caused other problems in my life (literally wanted to sleep all the time).  And anyway, the medication is just a band-aid.<p>Early this year a full-on panic attack hit me.  The first time in 10 years.  A recent divorce and changing jobs were probably the stressors.  And ironically I was actually in a very happy place in my life.  The divorce had been done with for several months and I was at a job where I can really have an impact and don&#x27;t feel like I needed to look over my shoulder constantly.  My boss&#x27;s incredible understanding during this difficult time for me is testament to that.<p>But the panic doesn&#x27;t much care about those things.  It has a sneaky ability to strike when you least expect it.<p>Thankfully I found a great doctor whose therapy is evidence based.  If you suffer from panic/anxiety and seek treatment (which I HIGHLY suggest you do!) then be sure they&#x27;re trained in an evidence based technique.  I also recommend reading &quot;Hope And Help For Your Nerves&quot; or listening to &quot;Pass Through Panic&quot; by Claire Weekes.<p>What I&#x27;ve learned in the months since is that in order to overcome the panic and anxiety you have to do something very simple yet seemingly incredibly difficult; you have to let it happen.  Let the panic wash over you.  Don&#x27;t run.  Don&#x27;t distract yourself.  Close your eyes and focus on breathing from your belly--deep breaths from the belly rather than shallow breaths from the chest.  And then pay attention to where the panic is and what it feels like.  Just observe whats happening and let it happen.<p>You have an upper-boundary to how bad it can get because your body can only produce so much adrenaline.  So let it.  It&#x27;ll spend itself out and calm down automatically.  The more you let it happen the faster you&#x27;ll calm down because you&#x27;re reworking those neural pathways.  Literally retraining your brain that no, in fact, you&#x27;re not being attacked by a lion.  You might feel like you just got hit by a car afterwards and, interestingly, to your body its the same thing, but the significant bit here is <i>you&#x27;re not going to die!</i>.  <i>You&#x27;re not going to go crazy[1]!</i>.  You&#x27;re going to be ok.<p>This time it might be a 10 on a scale of 1-10 but the next time, as long as you let it happen, it&#x27;ll probably be an 8/9.  Then the next time maybe a 5/6.  And on and on until pretty soon it&#x27;ll happen and you&#x27;ll say, &quot;Oh, hello old friend.  Shall we do some work?&quot;<p>[1]: &quot;Going crazy&quot; as a loose term for something like schizophrenia which the science is showing you will have a genetic predisposition towards.  If you don&#x27;t have a direct blood family member who suffers from it then you probably don&#x27;t have it either.<p>EDIT: For clarification; I had stopped taking the medication a little over a year prior that first-in-10-years panic attack.",1400870745

But they&#x27;re usually in very short term situations, 1-2 year domiciles or in freakishly weird markets, weirder than SF or NYC markets to be honest.<p>It can&#x27;t be said enough in this discussion also, the notion that a renter will have all this extra money that they can invest highly liquid, better than housing, investment options just doesn&#x27;t work out in general. The post I linked to elsewhere in here goes into that in some depth, even goes over a couple scenarios.<p>Business property I don&#x27;t think is a good proxy for housing. Business value can swing wildly up and down and there&#x27;s far less of a guarantee that your business will even be worth what you put into it than in housing. You can literally pour tens of millions of dollars into a business year after year and have it be worth $0, but I can <i>almost</i> guarantee that I&#x27;ll be able to sell my house after 30 years for <i>at least</i> what I paid into it (the principle, I agree that interest is harder to recoup). More likely, I&#x27;ll be able to sell it for something far in excess. Even people who bought at the very peak of the property bubble will likely make a small profit.<p>But I also do agree that it&#x27;s not a very liquid asset. It&#x27;s hard to get money out of your house, but not impossible:<p>- After it&#x27;s paid off, all the money you were paying is now liquid<p>- You can rent out parts of your house, in sometimes non-traditional ways, I know one guy who rents out parts of his unfinished basement as temporary storage for people doing overseas employment. Another rents her property as horse grazing pasture. Another uses their very nicely decorate home as a shoot location for local photographers and charges a small site fee. The list goes on. Not all of these are impossible for renters, but a great many of them are.<p>- You can use equity in your home for personal loans. It&#x27;s not the same as liquid capital, but being able to raise a few hundred thousand dollars quickly can be useful and something renters can&#x27;t do at all.<p>- if you have lots of land, sometimes you can sell off parcels for other people to build on, or you can repurpose it into business use<p>- you can sell it outright. One thing my wife and I are considering is retiring to a place with very cheap rent and just converting our home value into a long retirement in Spain or Italy. Basically our mortgage payment will get used twice.<p>No matter what, after any period of time, the renter still has lost every single dollar they put into their housing. Which typically represents the single largest expense for most people, consuming usually between 30-50% of their net income.",1400870571

7790663,comment,7789753,7790498,3,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> Not in US antitrust law, where market power and monopoly power are mostly defined in relation to empirically demonstrated effective power to raise prices or exclude competitors.<p>There is a difference between what something is and what you can use as evidence of it. There is this whole issue in antitrust law about how you define the market. For example, is MacOS in the same &quot;market&quot; as Windows? The accused monopolist always wants to paint the market as broad. Microsoft says it doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly because Apple is competing with it. If Microsoft claims the market is that broad, but they can still do all the things you would expect a monopolist to be able to do and customers don&#x27;t abandon them, it&#x27;s evidence that the supposedly competing company isn&#x27;t actually providing competition and they do actually have a monopoly.<p>> The existence of <i>effective</i> competition would deny these abilities (by definition), but actually having other competitors <i>exist</i> in the market at issue <i>doesn&#x27;t</i>.<p>That&#x27;s just a language trick. Effective competition comes from having competitors. If you don&#x27;t have effective competition it&#x27;s because your &quot;competitors&quot; aren&#x27;t actually competing with you, either because they&#x27;re cooperating or because they&#x27;re not actually offering the same product in the same market (i.e. in either case they aren&#x27;t actually competitors).",1400869961

This article and each of the others linked don&#x27;t offer much beyond jabs at Amazon.<p>As far as I can tell, publishers are unhappy with Amazon - period. Two years ago the hot news was about Amazon pricing books too low [1]. Now at least part of the complaint is that Amazon isn&#x27;t discounting enough and allowing prices to approach list price - which I assume is set by the publisher. Isn&#x27;t that a publisher problem?<p>Also, this all reminds me of what we used to hear in the music industry - creators hurting because the label (publisher) they&#x27;re contracted with is feuding and refusing to eat whatever compromise rather than pass it on directly or indirectly.<p>Would it be a terrible thing if Amazon pressured books into changing the same way iTunes changed music?<p>1: <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/11/tech/web/apple-lawsuit-cheaper-ebooks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2012/04/11/tech/web/apple-lawsuit-cheaper...</a>",1400868870

If no one wants to do it then it will become more expensive to find people to do it. That will drive others to come up with an automated solution to the problem that, while expensive, will be cheaper than paying someone to do it. Eventually someone will come up with a solution that maybe wasn&#x27;t even considered before, like self-cleaning toilets or something.<p>Now everyone is better off (toilets are clean and no one needs to clean them), because people were free to do what they enjoy.<p>This is why I believe in basic income, where people don&#x27;t need to clean toilets for a living, and the actual issue of &quot;how do we, as a society, get clean toilets, without submitting anyone to the awful task of cleaning them?&quot; comes up for debate. Right now we don&#x27;t talk about it because our system makes some people&#x27;s livelihoods depend on their cleaning toilets, so they have to do it for the benefit of others, even though they&#x27;d rather do something else. Basic income is a very efficient way to force those problems to be solved, via the ingenuity of those that like problem-solving (entrepreneurs), because it makes it so that it&#x27;s less likely that you can force someone to work doing something they&#x27;d rather not do.<p>That&#x27;s just how I understand it.",1400868870

Basically when developing various scenarios you set an initial distribution (the baseline) and then make scenarios, variations on that baseline. (I imagine it&#x27;s quite similar for people doing serious exercises with the tool in the OP, I&#x27;ve also written tools to assess investment options, that is similar too).<p>(The above is a simple example of a personal budget which I always use to illustrate the point, my actual use case is usually something like &#x27;spend more on nature protection and less on road maintenance, but don&#x27;t change expenditure on social security&#x27;. It&#x27;s easy to see how various political persuasions have some sliders they don&#x27;t want to budge on, some they want to minimize, and others to maximize).<p>Usually you need some form of &#x27;reserve&#x27; account in your UI; i.e., you&#x27;re &#x27;spending&#x27; from a certain total, and as you increase/decrease some items, that amount is taken from / added back to the reserve. But then how do you guarantee people always spend everything (in some cases that is needed) without introducing modality (i.e., a dialog that says &#x27;you need to spend everything&#x27; when you click &#x27;next&#x27; or whatever). And sometimes you need a way to move units between accounts, without using the reserve as an intermediate store; plus you usually need a way to move exact amounts, which is hard to do with sliders.<p>Another approach is something where you stick with the sliders you proposed, and add functionality to &#x27;fix&#x27; certain ones, and optionally a way to indicate how much to increase/decrease the others. E.g., proportional to their current values, or distribute the amount equally, or something else, ... The problem with this approach is that it is natural for nerds, but almost instantly becomes unwieldy for &#x27;normal&#x27; users. And in that case, the &#x27;fuck it, let&#x27;s do it in Excel&#x27; is better.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in this sort of things, I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts or see mockups on other ways you think this could be done.
