However, that&#x27;s only after assuming that the author of the document has managed to get the PDF reader to start running arbitrary C and JavaScript code within the sandboxes, respectively.  Because JavaScript is a fundamentally memory safe language, it is drastically less likely for a document parser written in JavaScript to end up running arbitrary code from the document than the equivalent in C.<p>Not that it matters in this case, since an attacker can just hand you a HTML page and run JavaScript that way, but it&#x27;s worth noting that parsing in a high-level language is an accomplishment in general.",1399600755

No hearer.\nWhen seeing the sight, there is just the sight. No seer.\nWhen feeling the sensation, there is just the sensation. No feeler.<p>Why is it then that the feeling and the seeing seem to be occurring to &quot;me&quot; when they are in actuality simply occurring to themselves? It is because this self-known experiences are highly integrated with each other within this body.\nI assume that you too are having experiences that are not &quot;happening to you&quot;, but are rather self known. So your hearing is just the heard. Your seeing is just the seen. Since &quot;your&quot; seen and &quot;my&quot; seen are not integrated, they appear to be happening &quot;over there&quot; and &quot;over here&quot;.<p>But, due to this lack of integration, I ultimately can not be sure that there are other experiences out there, but it seems like a good pragmatic assumption :-)",1399600546

Probably not.<p>How do you know?<p>> I&#x27;d say that act of computation has more to say about consciousness that the actual result itself.<p>And what is the act of computation?  Is it not just a progression of relationships in the physical world?  Surely consciousness doesn&#x27;t require an observer to look at the atoms bouncing around in the computer to decide that they are simulation of Frodo.  Surely it&#x27;s just the evolving relationship between the atoms that&#x27;s all that matters.  If we could interpret any physical system as evolving in a way that&#x27;s isomorphic to a brain, shouldn&#x27;t that also produce consciousness?  Maybe at the end of the day consciousness is just the &quot;existence&quot; (whatever that means) of a certain Turing machine or number.<p>And if all of your understanding of this world is based on the state of your brain now, then isn&#x27;t it a simpler explanation that now and your impression of consciousness, in this moment, is all that really exists?<p>A philosopher is someone bright enough to pose such questions and dim enough to pursue their answers.",1399600123

We do not have perfect memory and continually deal with lossy information integration. The idea that consciousness is lossless is basically a straw man. I think it is fair to say that the brain enforces consistency of representations of the universe and in that way provides something that appears to be unitary, but it does so by discarding lots of information. Furthermore it is pretty clear that we do not have lossless memory. Any cursory look at the literature on eyewitness testimony will show this.<p>TL;DR The brain lies to us all the time.

7718862,comment,7718377,7718377,3,0,tekni5,,,"This is going to sound pretty absurd, but I have this unscientific hypothesis about what consciousness really is.<p>I believe there is a chance that consciousness is a requirement for a universe to exist. Without consciousness the universe exists as random information, contained within some infinite outside universe, where there is no time or space.<p>So imagine this infinite outside universe full of all possible information, it exists in some metaphysical location, it has always existed and it will always exist. All this data makes zero sense and has zero purpose. Within this information exist patterns of every kind, everything real and not real is there. However for this data to become expressed, a conscious entity is required to exist inside of this data for the overall universe to place it in some sort of order.<p>Therefore consciousness acts as a binder of random information, for this very conscious entity to exist some of this infinite information must be placed in a coherent order. So in this view, the start of the universe does not occur with the big bang, but with the first conscious entity. After this point, for consciousness to continue to exist, it must have a narrative based on fundamental laws which explain how it came into existence. All of history is created after the first conscious entity appears, the formation of the planets, evolution, etc.<p>To better understand this, imagine a roll of film. You take each frame of this film and make it a separate slide. If you shuffle all these separate film slides and ask someone to view them in no given order, it would make very little sense of what the storyline is. However if you let them sort this information, they might be able to arrange this film in a continuous and coherent storyline. Similarly each planck time of our universe is a separate slide of information which exists in infinity. If a conscious entity exists in that frame the universe must provide a coherent storyline for that entity. Therefore additional frames are pulled out from infinity to allow consciousness to glide through infinity and essentially exist.<p>I hope that made sense, if I have failed to explain it I apologize.",1399599793

Social Justice Warriors often times fantasize about making bullying, name calling, and stereotyping illegal. They can be found in high concentration at places like Reddit, Vice, & Gawker Media sites constantly talking about race/gender/class while ignoring statistics on race/gender/class. They demand that you are politically correct in everything you say. Their favorite insults are &quot;you&#x27;re racist&quot; and &quot;you&#x27;re sexist&quot;. Basically &quot;the thought police&quot;.<p>Example; When Paul Graham of Y-Combinator mentioned how strong foreign accents can hinder a founder&#x27;s ability to communicate with his team (which is common sense) he was attacked by silicon valley news outlets for being anti-immigrant, possibly racist, and xenophobic. When he later gave his opinion on why there&#x27;s so few women in tech he was again attacked and called sexist. This is the problem with Social Justice Warriors, they are warriors, warriors are willing to go to extremes to achieve hero status.<p>In moderation social justice isn&#x27;t bad. Religion or patriotism isn&#x27;t bad either. Neither is conservatism or liberalism. But when taken to an extreme these ideologies end up becoming illogical, irrational, and causing damage to a society&#x27;s expressive or civil freedoms.",1399599552

The term is impossible to define except in terms that are unintelligible without a grasp of what consciousness means. Many fall into the trap of equating consciousness with self-consciousness—to be conscious it is only necessary to be aware of the external world. Consciousness is a fascinating but elusive phenomenon: it is impossible to specify what it is, what it does, or why it has evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.[19]<p>Philosophers and non-philosophers differ in their intuitions about what consciousness is.[20] While most people have a strong intuition for the existence of what they refer to as consciousness,[21] skeptics argue that this intuition is false, either because the concept of consciousness is intrinsically incoherent, or because our intuitions about it are based in illusions. Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. [...] More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.[19]<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness</a><p>Suppose that consciousness didn&#x27;t actually exist, but within this theory you grant that people really do have perceptions and experiences.

Science most definitely does not stand on the theory of philosophy (if so, which theory does all of science depend upon?), and neither would it have disappeared from across cultures simply because the west forgot to introduce science itself to the rest of the world. The fact that science arose independently across cultures tells us that it does not rest on any rigorous philosophical theory. But who gets to space flight without some theory of gravity and motion? It&#x27;s because space flight does depend on a tall body of theory.<p>Science is simply a community and inter-generational task of causal modeling via evidence. It cannot be denied simply because the west forgot to tell the rest of the world of philosophy. Science was invented by no philosophical theory. Humongous western development may have been spurred by the worldview of western philosophers, but science does not need such roots.<p>This is not the same as Newton laying down the groundwork for a physics. Now that is a pillar of theory that a community builds around. That&#x27;s no sarcasm by the way, but rather it is awe and respect for a theory that can act as a pillar or bedrock of continual community growth and stable theoretical illumination for hundreds of years.<p>Have philosophers finally built any pillar by which they may create tall structures? Or is everything they make made of sand, and thus their buildings are only waist high after thousands of years across cultures?<p>At most, science only needs 1% of philosophy in order to have some self-perspective. But let&#x27;s not go too deep in, because we know that pillars of sand cannot build any cross-cultural theory beyond waist-high structures.",1399597247

Because of lazy evaluation, Haskell won&#x27;t necessarily implode on non-TCO recursive functions (example: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13042353/does-haskell-have-tail-recursive-optimization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13042353/does-haskell-hav...</a>), and will actually sometimes cause a stack overflow on &quot;optimized&quot; functions.<p><i>Until now, the only &quot;principled&quot; way I knew of to transform this into something sensible was through memoization, but that&#x27;s still very wasteful.</i><p>I think &quot;real&quot; Haskell code usually favors operations of lists over recursive functions. That said, the standard way to transform your recursive structure into something &quot;sensible&quot; is to use a tail-recursive function. In basically any other functional language, you&#x27;d go with that approach.<p>To get the same &quot;benefit&quot; in Haskell, you&#x27;d have to force strict evaluation inside of a tail-recursive function. This prevents a thunk from causing problems. That said, Haskell doesn&#x27;t always build up a normal stack on a regular recursive call.<p>Otherwise, you&#x27;d just use a list structure.<p>(Someone correct me if I&#x27;ve said something stupid.)<p>ref:<p><a href=""http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Tail_recursion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Tail_recursion</a>",1399597200
