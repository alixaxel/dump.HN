Now I&#x27;ll grant you that writing in assembly is not a fly-by-night skill, but at some level everything relies on abstractions.<p>Any common programming language comes with some set of tools, in the form of libraries and built-in keywords. The only difference between modern web libraries and language libraries is that modern libraries evolve and change at a much faster rate.<p>While a web developer may not be looking as closely to what is running on the metal, they are every bit as focused on being a craftsman at their level of abstraction.

Rewriting the necessary protocols/libraries in a type-safe manner already provides an improvement over the current systems. In addition, (with the standard approach) it&#x27;s quite hard for a developer to reason about the whole stack they&#x27;re using and privilege escalation bugs are particularly irksome. Writing the applications with the approach Mirage takes means that there is <i>less</i> code to reason about.<p>An anecdote I use when describing the benefits is the story of a smart fridge that got hacked and became part of a botnet sending spam emails. Why did that fridge even have code that allowed it to send email? It wasn&#x27;t necessary for its functioning. We should write software differently if were going to be deploying it to 10x the number of devices compared to today.<p>More personally, I worry about the software that&#x27;s going to find it&#x27;s way into the embedded health devices of the future (cf pacemakers). These devices will inevitably be &#x27;connected&#x27; and I want to make sure that the code they use is safe and secure.",1399769496

In response to an FOIA request for details on the tracking, their response was that all the data was part of an &quot;active investigation&quot; and would not be disclosed. I think this was the first time a city has tried to hide details of a surveillance dragnet like this, across an metro area, by claiming basically the entire city was being actively investigated. [1]<p>In that light, this development is extremely concerning, and I can only hope the judiciary will push back hard to protect some semblance of the 4th. The average person doesn&#x27;t typically consider themselves a target, but as the number of dragnets increase, and if the Feds can perform mass-hacking of our personal devices where the results are <i>directly</i> admissible in court (putting aside parallel construction for a moment) this mentality will have to change.<p>The writing has been on the wall for a while, but there&#x27;s always been some comfort that at least the mass surveillance wouldn&#x27;t be admissible.

There is no way possible they are going to make it that easy to find them.<p>Here&#x27;s my story:<p>I kept getting calls from &quot;credit card services&quot; and every damn time I asked to be removed they would just hang up on me.  So, after about the 20th time, I decided to play dumb.  I strung them along for 10 minutes.  Here&#x27;s how I did that: the first person you talk with asks if you have more than $3000 in CC debt.  The second person basically asks the same thing, but in a little more depth.  The third guy is the smooth talker.  He asks you to find your statement so he can verify information from it.  I played dumb and said I needed to find it.  He said &quot;I&#x27;ll wait&quot; in a very patient voice.  I kept him on the like for 10 minutes (while I worked).  Then, I just hung up.  He called back immediately and said we accidentally got disconnected.  I told him &quot;you wouldn&#x27;t take me off your list, so fuck you.&quot;<p>His revenge was next.  The phone rang and someone was yelling at me.  He was redirecting all complaints to my phone number.  I had to unplug my phone.<p>I called AT&T (who I had service with) and after about 30 minutes of run around, they said they couldn&#x27;t do anything.  I&#x27;d have to contact the fraud department, or some such.  I did try, but it was a lot of paperwork and it looked very bureaucratic.<p>So, I decided to google for &quot;credit card services&quot; (not exactly that, but that&#x27;s what I started with).  I found a TX state lawsuit against a company with this name from the early 2000&#x27;s.  The lawyer that prosecuted them was listed and had a phone number.  So, I called it.  An elderly gentleman picked up the phone and I told him my story.  His first words, &quot;so, they&#x27;re back at it?&quot;  He told me to be very careful, and basically tried to dissuade me from doing anything.<p>It amazed me that they seem to operate with impunity.",1399769309

Many commenters on various forums think they should be as copyrightable as any other code. (It&#x27;s easy to find them: look for the most heavily downvoted comments.) Moreover, most developers who do not agree with the decision (including engineers who testified on behalf of Google) will wholeheartedly agree that writing APIs require all the creative expression involved in writing code.<p>2) Does anyone really believe Google independently came up with an API from specification that was a verbatim copy of <i>37 separate API packages</i>? Please. Google&#x27;s language was specifically crafted to reduce their own liability, but come on, nobody&#x27;s buying that they didn&#x27;t copy it wholesale. Maybe when you&#x27;re grading high school assignments you see coincidental identical code. The API for the stdlib of the most popular programming language currently is not a high school level thing.",1399766477
