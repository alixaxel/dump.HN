That&#x27;s because history is littered with formerly extremely popular fields like aeronautics which at some point crashed and never returned (aero/astro did so in the early &#x27;70s).  So even for MIT far less than 10% of its faculty will &quot;ever be in computer science&quot; given your latter interpretation of the phrase and the fact that many EECS faculty are EE types.",1400947085

7793563,comment,7793402,7793473,2,0,oschwald,,,"As the article mentions, this issue is not limited to PHP. Many ORMs have similar issues. For instance, I recently ran into essentially the same issue with DBIx::Class in Perl. The problem there was further compounded by the fact that many subroutines in Perl behave differently in different contexts, meaning that code like this may not be safe:<p>$resulset->search({ column1 => some_sub($arg), column2 => $value2, ...});<p>Many subs may behave in unexpected ways when using list context, such as returning an empty list. You may end up with values, which are normally escaped, becoming keys in the hashref. DBIC only does the simplest of checks on the key values, leaving your code open to an SQL injection.<p>This sort of issue is unfortunately prevalent. It is not just limited to PHP and dismissing it as such does everyone a disservice.",1400946786

7793560,comment,7793305,7793437,3,0,nnq,,,"> but I really doubt there is much of an advantage to teaching your child Depth-First Search<p>There is a <i>huge</i> advantage <i>if</i> you can teach it to him in a way that he can understand it, not just memorize the algorithm, like the unfortunate way kids learn to divide and multiply without understanding wtf they are actually doing, which is a big IF. It&#x27;s a basic reasoning skill, even more basic than &quot;basic logic&quot; or arithmetic and <i>if</i> you can wire it into a very young mind you&#x27;ve changed that mind <i>for ever.</i> He will understand much better anything from philosophy to the theory of evolution, because you will have <i>primed the mind for algorithms and logic.</i> It doesn&#x27;t matter if he ends up an investment bank manager or a politician, he will have learned <i>how to understand algorithmic thinking.</i><p>90% of the population are, imho, what I call &quot;mud-minds&quot;, they are incapable of <i>deep understanding</i> of logic and algorithmic knowledge, they can just learn instructions and apply them, sometimes to great results, but they don&#x27;t &quot;grok&quot; them. And when it comes to truly abstract concepts that have no direct equivalent in the real world, they can only recite definitions from books, they have no &quot;intuitive vision&quot; of abstractions. And I think they are like this because their parents and teachers fed them a strict diet of 100% practical knowledge and scientific <i>facts</i> and never exposed them to abstract algorithms, patterns and processes. (As a different line of thinking, I think &quot;separating the mind from reality&quot; also helps young minds get a better grip of abstraction, like &quot;running&quot; an algorithm or visualizing a pattern as pieces of a fantasy world or advice of an imaginary companion, though child psychologists would obviously not be happy of such ideas of education...)<p>By teaching your kid something like depth-first-search (A* search on a game maze map would be even more awesome if you can grab a kid&#x27;s attention though...), you give him a chance of not becoming such a &quot;mud mind&quot;.<p>True, if a kid is technically oriented, you&#x27;ll probably have more luck teaching him/her general programming before a bunch of algorithms. But the algorithms are the stuff that really &quot;sharpens the mind&quot; and you don&#x27;t even need programming to get them, they can be explained in more mathematical or more graphical terms. <i>And you don&#x27;t even need a computer to teach a kid depth-first-search and you don&#x27;t even have to tell him how it&#x27;s called or what it is, just try and imprint a deep intuitive understanding of the process and algorithm on his mind.</i>",1400946727

As the parent said, at least location / cost of living needs to be factored in.<p>That being said, it&#x27;s probably worth noting for younger folks that ALL of the top fields, in terms of expected compensation, are all STEM fields (mostly engineering).

7793556,comment,7793305,7793472,6,0,econner,,,"I can speak to a few anecdotal factors having recently graduated from Stanford.<p>1) The current tech boom.  \nThere&#x27;s the perception of being able to easily create a startup or to get a programming job at a tech company. Some major in computer science also for the technical skills it gives even though they plan not to pursue programming as a job.  They may want to become a PM, or a related non day-to-day programming role for which understanding technical concepts is important.<p>2) Financial downturn of 08.\nMany students who would have previously majored in economics or finance have chosen computer science due to the folding of many investment banks as well as the increasing negative perception of working on Wall Street.<p>3) Increase in diversity of the major.\nThe major has become more interdisciplinary.  You used to be required to take very &quot;hardcore&quot; classes like operating systems and compilers.  Now though with the rise of fields like HCI the major has become more diverse.<p>4) Social tipping-point.\nThere is a common joke at Stanford that everyone is a CS major.  More people majoring in CS means more help from peers who have been through the same classes and can help out.  This social support leads to the positive feedback loop of more people entering the major.",1400946619

The email shortener thing adds light protection against bots harvesting emails. The Bitcoin address shortening feature lets you point to BTC addresses on fields where only URLs are allowed, and displays a useful QR code alongside the address. tny.im can also act as a pastebin, in case you haven&#x27;t noticed (paste the text in the &quot;Paste or type item to shorten here&quot;).\nURL shorteners are also useful on IRC.<p>Personally, I use the link list feature to save a snapshot of open tabs when I&#x27;m reasearching something on a public computer and want to open the same set of pages later, at home or on another public terminal where I don&#x27;t have access to conventional browser bookmarks.

Java makes exception handling explicit and compiler checked -- hacking around checked exceptions makes exception handling implicit and human-checked, meaning that there&#x27;s absolutely no static verification of a critical component of your API contract.<p>The problem isn&#x27;t checked exceptions, the problem is that exceptions suck, and the only way to use them in a way that doesn&#x27;t expose your code base to implicit GOTO failure modes is to use checked exceptions.<p>On our production software, we don&#x27;t use exceptions at all, except where required by an API; instead, we always use monadic error handling. We have an uncaught exception handler for threads/thread pools/etc that does one thing: log the exception, and terminate the running Java process via System.exit(), allowing the process&#x27;s watchdog to restart the failed process.<p>By its very nature, an uncaught exception is unexpected and places the process in an unknown state; the only safe thing to do is exit. Since the throwing of an uncaught exception triggers full process failure, it very much encourages defensive, safe practices that ensure that all error cases are handled and compiler-checked.<p>The result: our code is far more stable and reliable than any other project I&#x27;ve worked on, <i>especially</i> projects that have made use of runtime exceptions.",1400945374

Fertilizer is made of oil.<p>Not sure why as we don&#x27;t make fertilizer from oil, we make fertiliser from methane (natural gas usually) which is used to fix the nitrogen from air (NH3) which is the primary precursor for NH4NO3 (Ammonium Nitrate), the only time ammonium nitrate and oil meet is if you want a bang (ANFO).<p>> Many more people will fall out of the middle class. Tens of millions of people, or more, will starve.<p>No evidence for this either way to be honest.<p>> The overall economic result will be stagflation and there will be nothing that can be done with the spend, tax, or money supply levers.<p>Alternatively the massive push to restructure the economy towards a post oil future will create huge new markets and foster massive investment into non-oil power sources (batteries, nuclear, renewables) much like move to coal did in the 19th century and oil in the 20th.<p>> Energy is wealth.<p>Arguably you could use units of energy as a form of wealth but you know what we can extract more energy than we do right now world wide and never have to burn a drop of coal or oil, We have vast untapped reserves of nuclear fuels (the low ball estimates of a few <i>centuries</i> are largely because no one has looked since we had enough).<p>>  It took over 100 years to build this oil-based economy.<p>Not really, it&#x27;s been over a hundred years since we have had an oil-based economy the actual usage of oil boomed over a 15-20 year period in the early 20th.<p>> We have 20-60 years left to get off oil.<p>We (might) have 20-60 years to get off oil <i>if we continue to consume it at our current rates</i>, the price will go up as supply goes down, alternatives then become viable (nuclear and PV are not that far off on a kW/h basis already over their lifespan).<p>> If we do not start a production line to mass-produce safe nuclear power plants and find a way to safely reprocess the waste, it isn&#x27;t going to happen in time.<p>Define &quot;in time&quot; - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_in_France.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Electricity_in_France.svg</a> France went from generating a third of their electricity needs to 75% in under 20 years, they now generate 40% of their <i>entire</i> energy consumption from nuclear.<p>As for the waste problem that is largely solved with modern designs, old plants where dirty they where dirty because the technology was less developed <i>and</i> because they where designed to produce nuclear material for weapons, We can and have built plants that use their own waste as a useful by product produces vastly less waste.<p>> We spent trillions on wars and on bailing out an insane derivatives market<p>The US spent trillion on wars and on bailing out the insane derivatives market but you know what the biggest producer of PV panels and nuclear plants isn&#x27;t the US...<p>> Will we have the capital to switch away from oil?<p>Yes of course, given raw materials and energy we can move from oil.<p>Will a &quot;post-oil&quot; society look radically different to the one we have today probably and in ways I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine but it&#x27;s not a death knell for the human race (in fact getting off burning that crap for energy on the whole will be a good thing...the irony is we might stop fucking up the planet (in terms of CO2 emissions) purely because we no longer can.<p>As a european socialist by inclination it&#x27;s ironic that I think the solution is largely going to be market driven but hey whatever works.",1400945094

But whoa, step into the state of a man&#x27;s spiritual condition and all bets are off.<p>Suddenly it&#x27;s every man for himself, isolated in his own tiny world that (supposedly) has absolutely zero crossover to another man&#x27;s world.  Somehow, gravity in one man&#x27;s world pulls things up, and in another it pushes all objects to the sky.<p>But does that even make sense?  It&#x27;s really just hogwash, and a convenient easy-exit from having to wrestle with a challenging state of affairs.  We all have the same fundamental needs, and we even live in a world where the very fundamental building blocks of the universe can be explained in distinct formulas with distinct &quot;right&quot; answers.<p>Unfortunately if that really were the case -- that spirituality really only applied to a single man alone -- then the message of grace from God would have stopped at Christ himself and never spread to another man&#x27;s life.  But it has not, and will continue to affect each man who discovers the spiritual wonders of a grace-filled life.  Grace, does, in fact, present a freeing answer to all those who seek it.",1400944115

(By this I mean explorer, not how Unix users understand the term &quot;shell&quot;.) I felt that way too. XP got a little better as hardware improved and SP2 fixed some issues, then Vista made everyone forget what they hated before and suddenly XP was the &quot;lean&quot; one.<p>(Actually the more likely explanation is that the 2000-using XP-haters and the XP-using Vista-haters are not the same people.
