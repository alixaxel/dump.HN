More often they represent a misunderstanding - rewriting a post can fix this - or they represent a conflict with community guidelines/standards - rewriting can also fix this. Sometimes the best edits are deletions.<p>It&#x27;s the tone, particularly the opening line that is likely to cause downvoting of your post. It&#x27;s demeaning and PHP trolling and unsubstantiated, and therefore, poorly written for HN. The technical discussion which follows, though fine, can&#x27;t fix it.<p>Good luck.",1399694396

7724412,comment,7723484,7723484,1,0,ianbicking,,,"&quot;In Michigan, however, which has the highest population of mute swans in North America, the creatures are considered pests. According to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the statewide breeding population increased from about 5,700 to more than 15,000 in just ten years. The birds attack people in the water and on shore, particularly children that wander too close to their nests.&quot;<p>Sometimes when I get excited that an animal population gets to the point of potentially excess, I have to remind myself that it might be that we&#x27;ve adapted our lives to the absence of the animal and can&#x27;t tolerate its presence even in modest amounts.  Yes, swans are aggressive, but just because they are annoying doesn&#x27;t mean they are overpopulated.  Or concerns that some wild cats might take dogs.  That sucks for the dog owner if it happens, but is it really okay to have the expectation that your animal can be in nature without any natural repercussions?<p>That said, once swans become common we shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to push back against their aggressiveness.  Nature does have away to balance behavior, and if humans think they just have to put up with asshole swans or else kill the swans I think we&#x27;re missing out on some obvious behavior correction opportunities.",1399693549

People like to say that welfare acts as a form of BI, but that is far from the truth.  Most welfare programs in the US contain requirements that recipients at least look for a job, stay drug-free, etc.  With BI, people that don&#x27;t want to work will simply move in with each other.  $12K/yr isn&#x27;t really enough for 1 person to have a good life; however $60K/yr for a household of 5 with no taxes taken out comes alot closer.",1399693396

7724401,comment,7721096,7721963,2,0,YZF,,,"Always is a bit of a strong word but yes, it&#x27;s always true.<p>Virtual functions in C++ which allow some form of dynamic behaviour are slower than static function calls because they inherently involve another level of indirection.  Static calls are known at compile time, they can be inlined by the compiler, they can be optimized in the context in which they&#x27;re called.  Now, nothing prevents the C++ run-time from trying to do the same thing at run-time but you can relatively easily see that it&#x27;ll have to make some other compromised to do so.  Nothing prevents a C++ program from generating C++ code at run-time, compiling it, and loading it into the current process as a .so.  Now that&#x27;s a pretty dynamic behaviour but there&#x27;s again an obvious price.  You can also write self modifying code.  At any rate, static languages are capable of the same dynamic behaviour that dynamic languages are capable of but you often have to implement that behaviour yourself (or embed an interpreter...).<p>Fundamentally, a dynamic language can&#x27;t make the kinds of assumptions a more static language can make, it can try and determine things at run-time (ala JIT) but those take time and still have to adapt to the dynamics of the language.  The same line of code &quot;a = b + c&quot; in Python can mean something completely different every time it&#x27;s executed so the run-time has to figure out what the types are an invoke the right code.  Now the real problem is that if you take advantage of that then no one can actually tell what this code is doing and it is utterly unmaintainable.<p>To compound the problems facing dynamic languages is the fact that CPUs are optimized for executing &quot;predictable&quot; code.  When your language is dynamic there are more dependencies in the instruction sequence and things like branch prediction may become more difficult.  It also doesn&#x27;t help that some of the dynamic languages we&#x27;re discussing have poor locality in memory (that&#x27;s an orthogonal issue though, you could give a dynamic language much better control over memory).<p>EDIT: One would think it should be possible to design a language which has both dynamic and static features where if you restrict yourself to the static portion runs just as fast as any other statically compiled language and still allows to switch to more dynamic concepts and pay the price when you do that.",1399693252

The best I have been able to determine is that it should be pegged to half the minimum wage, i.e. equivalent to a 20 hour job at minimum wage, which works out to about $600/mo.

Because fitting within basic income will massively expand client base for companies, there might actually be devaluation if it&#x27;s set too low.<p>I think it&#x27;s pretty obvious that one cannot choose the level of basic income. You can only do damage by choosing wrong. Given that it&#x27;s currently zero, if you&#x27;d want to do this, start at a very low level (but still high enough to make companies want to provide services at that level), work out the kinks, and increase it over the course of a few years slowly until you see undesirable phenomena, then stop.

This was one of my 1st questions when joining in 2003!<p>Some Wayback Machine queries require sorted key traversal: listing all dates for which captures of an URL are available, the discovery of the <i>nearest-date</i> for an URL, and listing all available URLs beginning with a certain URL-prefix.<p>Maintaining the canonically-ordered master index of (URL, date, pointer) – that 20TB second-level index rajbot mentions – allows both kinds of queries to be satisfied. And once you&#x27;ve got that artifact, the individual capture lookups can be satisfied fairly efficiently, too. (A distributed-hashtable would then be something extra to maintain.)<p>Also, the queries <i>aren&#x27;t</i> random: there are hot ranges, and even a single user&#x27;s session begins with a range query (all dates for an URL), then visits one URL from that same range. Then loading nearest-date captures for the page&#x27;s inline resources starts hitting similar ranges, as do followup clicks on outlinks or nearby dates. So even though the master index is still on spinning disk (unless there was a recent big SSD upgrade that escaped my notice), the ranges-being-browsed wind up in main-memory caches quite often.<p>There&#x27;s no doubt many places that could be improved, but this basic sorted-index model has fit the application well for a long while, avoided too much domain-specific complexity, and been amenable to many generations of index/sharding/replication/internal-API tweaks.<p>BTW, the Archive is hiring for multiple technical roles, including a senior role developing a next-generation of the Wayback Machine: <a href=""https://archive.org/about/jobs.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/about/jobs.php</a>",1399691565

The director was there, and afterwards he did a Q&A.  Someone asked &quot;Is there anything you would have changed about your movie?&quot;  The director&#x27;s response: &quot;If I had had $400 more, I would have [filmed a scene much differently]&quot;.<p>So the immediate follow-up was &quot;Wait, $400?  How much did your movie cost?&quot;  The answer: $7000.<p>It turns out that you may have even heard of this particular movie: it was Shane Carruth&#x27;s Primer.  It&#x27;s one of those small indie films that managed to break out and make a profit.  But I guarantee for every Primer there are 100 other films that don&#x27;t make it, and some of them are quite good.  The question is do we really want to lose access to those films?<p>(I personally think the answer is trying to get that $800 down to under $100 through automation and tools, but we&#x27;re not there yet.)<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primer_(film)</a>",1399691015
