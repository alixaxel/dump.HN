Secondly, the ownership of entire cellphone bands isn&#x27;t the only kind of property right over spectrum that could exist.<p>Ownership of entire cellphone bands would actually be somewhat unlikely. For a court following &#x27;Tribune Co. v.

7731000,comment,7730472,7730940,3,0,jerf,,,"&quot;I certainly suffered under that monopoly (as did the entire industry) but couldn&#x27;t the argument be made that market forces took care of it without government intervention?&quot;<p>YMMV vary, but my conclusion is this: The government successfully prevented Microsoft from crushing the rest of the browsers. They really were trying, really did damage Netscape, and really were well on their way to <i>more</i> dominance in that field than they had a &quot;right&quot; too. And they were on their way, too; Netscape was faltering and IE was a better browser for a good long time. As it is they still had enough dominance to end up causing web tech to stagnate badly for a few years.<p>However, recall why Microsoft was so scared of the browser, which is that it threatened to become its own OS and make it so you could run a computer without Windows that could do everything you needed. <i>Broadly speaking</i> (bear with me here), this still has not happened. Here in 2014, you could run a small business out of a browser, and you can do a lot with a Chromebook, but Windows is still around, still powerful, and still pretty full of legacy software that doesn&#x27;t exist in a browser and businesses are not having an easy time disposing of... witness the continuing lurching life of Windows XP, which Microsoft <i>wants</i> to be rid of and can&#x27;t be.<p>I think it was a good decision and still correct, even if ultimately it really only served as a very large shot across Microsoft&#x27;s bow (even if it was aimed at the hull) due to the fact that the browsers of the time weren&#x27;t going to be able to manifest the promise of displacing Windows. We&#x27;ll never know, but the secondary effects of chastising Microsoft may have been worth more than the primary effects ever could be. And I do think the secondary effects were more important; the direct impact pales in comparison to the fact that they&#x27;d just been notified they couldn&#x27;t proceed down that path any farther than they&#x27;d already gone without the costs exceeding the benefits.<p>Of course, what truly displaced Microsoft turned out to be more Apple, via the MacOSX and mobile, which Microsoft continues to struggle with. But so may years ago, who&#x27;da thunk it? And it would have been silly for the government to count on that.",1399863293

Four way stops have both a &quot;whoever was here first goes&quot; rule and a &quot;we arrived at approximately the same time so the person on the right goes&quot; rule.

7730997,comment,7726923,7728122,2,0,hswoo2,,,"In Australia if you had an aortic aneurism such that it was highly likely for you to die anyway it is highly unlikely for you have any claims in the tort of negligence as it requires a gross negligence on the part of the doctor such that it has a substantial link to the causation of the death. There also defences of necessity - that is the person is dying therefore it is necessary for the doctors to take all measures to save the patient. Thus it is probably significantly difficult for a person to be successful in medical malpractice unless it was blatantly largely caused by the doctor alone.<p>I also would guess that the US would have a similar legal system, which allows for such defences from such claims.<p>It seems that if courts are paying out too much this is not an issue to do with people making frivolous claims and cashing in but with the way the judiciary is deciding on the claims. If it was more difficult for claims to be successful in court this would stamp out such claims instead of imposing monetary caps which don&#x27;t allow for the flexibility to compensate each individual case.<p>I find it strange that the legislature is getting involved in an area which is really up to the judiciary to perform its function...",1399863158

7730980,comment,7729538,7730271,3,0,jerf,,,"I learned to lucidly dream when I was 8 or 10 or so. I was having a recurring dream where I was being chased by a Big Bad Thing, something crocodile-esque that wanted to eat me. Of course I ran away, but in general you can&#x27;t deliberately run away from something in a dream; the act of remembering that you are running away from an X itself keeps X around. I finally was able to &quot;carry in&quot; the knowledge that this must be my recurring dream, so after running away for a bit, I turned around and jumped in the crocodile&#x27;s mouth.<p>I swear, a subconscious can be <i>surprised</i> at your dream actions. Perhaps someday we&#x27;ll understand the neuroscience enough to explain that. But I&#x27;d swear there was a two to three second massive <i>huh? what now?</i> from my subconscious. Once again, I was faced with the crocodile, almost by some sort of default, and once again, I jumped in. After that, the dream just moved on.<p>I haven&#x27;t had many nightmares since. Non-zero, but the incidence rate went way down.<p>If one is having troubles with &quot;simple&quot; nightmares, which is to say, bad dreams that are just bad for no apparent reason, as opposed to bad dreams which represent real traumas or real problems, lucid dreaming is certainly one good solution. Based on my personal experience I&#x27;d be a great deal less sanguine about lucid dreaming being able to deal with personal traumas... dreams are not logical, and if you&#x27;re having a nightmare based on real things the &quot;dream&quot; may metaphorically laugh off your attempts to change it (i.e., if you lost your buddy because you had forgotten to pack more bullets in a war situation, you can dream that you brought more but the &quot;enemy&quot; may well just soak them up and keep coming), but I guess it can&#x27;t hurt to try... based on reading around and even in comments on this thread, I&#x27;ve observed it&#x27;s even more difficult than usual to generalize from personal experience to general &quot;rules&quot; of dreaming because it&#x27;s probably pretty different for us all.",1399862816

There&#x27;s precedent for this from 1926, before the US government officially took up ownership of the airwaves, in Tribune Co. v.\nOak Leaves Broadcasting Station.<p>&quot;The Chicago Daily Tribune, calling itself WGN... broadcast entertainment as a means of marketing its publication. WGN filed a complaint in state court against another radio station, Oak Leaves, which had begun broadcasting in an adjacent wavelength. WGN claimed that it was necessary to maintain at least a 50-kilocycle separation between stations located within 100 miles of each other. They accused the Oak Leaves station of injuring their lawfully acquired business property.<p>Chancellor Francis S. Wilson decided the case in the tradition of property rights to common resources. His landmark decision, which established homesteading rights in “the ether,” found precedent in western water rights, among other established property traditions.<p>Wilson concluded the court was &quot;compelled to recognize rights which have been acquired by reason of the outlay and expenditure of money and the investment of time. . . . We are of the further opinion that, under the circumstances in this case, priority of time creates a superiority in right.&quot;<p>The Congress responded to Oak Leaves instantly. After years of debate and delay on a radio law, both houses jumped to pass a December 1926 resolution stating that no private rights to ether would be recognized as valid, mandating that broadcasters immediately sign waivers relinquishing all rights, and disclaiming any vested interests.&quot;<p>*Edit: This ownership wouldn&#x27;t necessarily extend to _entire spectrums_ as it does in the case of the government selling spectrum. In Tribune Co. v. Oak Leaves Broadcasting Station, for instance, WGN was granted the right to broadcast on a specific frequency within a certain area, which differs immensely from a company being able to &#x27;buy&#x27; a series of frequencies from the government such that no other entity in the country may uses this spectrum.",1399862398

Garrison Keillor was singing and monologueing about a substitute preacher from Netherlands. I rode around the center of the city on a green bicycle. The cobbles were unusually smooth.

While I was riding around I was thinking that the city was an invention, and I was certain I had never been in a city that looked like this.

That&#x27;s the level of responsibility and maturity I expect from people who maintain the lower layers of the software I run.<p>Far be it from me to tell the GNOME and systemd developers how to manage their projects, but by the same token they should not expect me (or people like me) to take them seriously if they&#x27;re not going to be responsible with the power they presume to wield over the ecosystem.",1399861708

The other two are current spikes in the channel during the switch in logic circuits (because you normally cannot let the output float, which means that during the switch you have to switch on both transistors at the same time, but that&#x27;s not a problem when driving some inductor/transformer), and energy loss due to voltage drop while the transistor is moving between on and off states (that&#x27;s where all the heat tends to come from - apart from the heat from the rectifying/free-wheeling diodes).",1399861309

At that point, there will not be much downside to releasing the source code, perhaps under a no-derivative-works license.  Potential exceptions I can think of include making it harder to re-secure the tweak when updating for newer iOS versions or to add features, since someone could make an illegal fork, and making it easier for someone else to simply clone it, but I would not personally consider either of those a big deal.  Of course, it will remain their choice whether to release anything; they may not see an upside, or, more likely, they will simply not see the request here and follow the norm of not doing so.

That&#x27;s about as tedious as it gets. I&#x27;ve actually been using <i>fewer</i> addons as time goes on and the Classic Theme Restorer addon has some additional UI tweaks that I find interesting.<p>That said, I generally use two Firefox profiles: One for general browsing, one for documentation. The former is configured to use Australis more or less as packaged while the latter is configured to appear as closely as possible to classical Firefox (minus the FF button). Although there are some things I don&#x27;t especially like about Australis, it&#x27;s grown on me, and I&#x27;m someone who likes his tabs <i>below</i> the address bar. Thus, as someone who&#x27;s been using both, I can&#x27;t help myself from thinking that you&#x27;re either not giving the new UI a fair wrap or you&#x27;re being unnecessarily harsh. Some of your earlier comments in this thread strongly point toward the latter, but I suspect I&#x27;m just reading too far into your apparent disappointment. Or your disappointment is coloring your opinion more than you might realize. The point is that there <i>are</i> solutions to rectify what you perceive as significant drawbacks in the direction of Firefox&#x27;s development.<p>> or to fix up functionality that has been broken or made worse.<p>To be honest, the only glaring issue I&#x27;ve found with FF29 is the rather horrid behavior of the print dialog. I like the direction it&#x27;s going, generally, but under KDE, it doesn&#x27;t allow printing a selection of text unless I re-enable the menu bar and print from there (maybe this works under Windows, I haven&#x27;t tried). Otherwise, I can&#x27;t think of any other issues that have been &quot;broken or made worse.&quot; Compared to Chromium with 50+ tabs open, Firefox is exceptionally light on system resources, and I&#x27;ve since switched my browsing habits to use FF instead.
