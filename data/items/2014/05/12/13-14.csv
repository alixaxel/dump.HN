I&#x27;ve played a lot of grognard games both computer and tabletop and I&#x27;ve never found a worthy evenly matched AI opponent although humans can kick my butt.

At the very least, Starbucks should be expected to call the police <i>on behalf of the victim</i>, just as Twitter should do.

One problem with GL (also D3D) is that it provides fairly highlevel abstractions which don&#x27;t exist on the hardware level and either limit the flexibility or performance (e.g. OpenGL has &quot;texture objects&quot;, when the GPU actually just sees a couple of sampler attributes and a blob of memory).
