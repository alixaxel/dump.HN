Based on the trial she wasn&#x27;t found entirely at fault.<p>The injury actually was relevant and not an emotive distraction.  McDonalds was selling coffee, not knives.  Most would have the expectation that spilling a cup of coffee on yourself wouldn&#x27;t leave you with 3rd degree burns on 6% of your body with 1st and 2nd degree burns on another 16%.  She not only needed eight days of hospitalization for skin grafts, but also years of medical treatment.<p>McDonalds acknowledged that customers had gotten 3rd degree burns from using their product in the executed manner (multiple customers with 3rd degree burns), but that they were unwilling to make a minor change to the product that would prevent this.<p>It was the fact that they knew they had already injured people to the point of needing hospitalization that could have been avoided by making a minor change to keep people from getting injured that was at the root of why they were at fault.  It was the fact that in court they stated that they were unwilling to make that change even after knowing about this injury that caused punitive damages, which the judge reduced.",1399813197

My wife was accompanying me to the place where my mother was staying. We passed down the corridor and reached the room. I knocked at the door, but there was no response from inside. I moved a bit to the left raising myself on my toes, such that her bed was visible from over the cabin’s wall. I could see her there, ‘Oh God please…’. “Mummy”, I shouted “Mummy uthiye..”. Normally, she would getup at our knocking and move feebly to open the door.<p>After shouting a few times, I got impatient and tried to open the door ourselves. Thankfully it opened.

Jim Gettys is such a nice sweet guy, who&#x27;s done much great work on so many things (did you know he was the editor of the HTTP/1.1 specification?), I sure didn&#x27;t want him to think I had an axe to grind with him about X-Windows [1]. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gettys"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Gettys</a><p>Here&#x27;s some of his sagely advice, which I&#x27;ll quote from his wikipedia page: &quot;He has pointed out a common fallacy among programmers today: that storing computed values in memory is preferable to recomputing those values later. This, he claims, is often false on current hardware, given fast CPUs and the long time it takes to recover from a potential cache miss.&quot;<p>But it&#x27;s a totally different story about that flaming political loony who desecrated the Jargon file, misrepresented hacker culture (and himself as a hacker), flat out lied about not misrepresenting anyone, and always used to sign himself off as &quot;the mad mastermind of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Netnews&quot; but never delivered on any of the hype he promised. But at least he was honest about being &quot;mad&quot;: he still says and stands by things like &quot;In the U.S., blacks are 12% of the population but commit 50% of violent crimes; can anyone honestly think this is unconnected to the fact that they average 15 points of IQ lower than the general population?&quot;<p>I would love to see a retrospective discussion of the people who blew up that whale!<p>[1] Yes, I still call it X-Windows in the hopes of annoying X fanatics.",1399809709

That you clearly think that you are still &quot;1337&quot; by being so dissmissive of a commonly used tool is arrogant and ridiculous. Also, your list of installed apps is missing TextEdit, which reads doc and docx files perfectly well. Unless of course you remove all of the other apps that come with OS X and literally only use those you list, which would be absurd.",1399809688
