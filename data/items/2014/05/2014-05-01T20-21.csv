This is an obvious step, and I believe pretty standard on any platform with a register calling convention. The registers are saved as integer registers followed by floating point registers. As an optimization, during a function call, %rax is required to hold the number of SSE registers used to hold arguments, to allow a varargs caller to avoid touching the FPU at all if there are no floating point arguments.&quot;)<p>When va_start is used, it needs to save argument registers to the stack in the prologue of the function.

Ant degrades into an unmaintainable mess as soon as any complexity enters the system.  XML is a horrible scripting language, simple imperative constructs are very awkward (loops/variables/conditionals).<p>Maven also suffers from XML hell, but at least it has dependency management.<p>I&#x27;ve used gradle extensively and it is quite difficult to figure out what is going on.  Using a debugger would be nice, but it simply doesn&#x27;t work.  Gradle is terribly slow on a big project, the update checks are the main culprit.  They should be done automatically in the background to alleviate this pain.<p>Since gradle is compiled rather than interpreted, calling code in the project being built is difficult and convoluted.  For example, if I want to call a DBUtil.cleanDB() method in my java code I can&#x27;t reference DBUtil in my gradle script as it hasn&#x27;t been built yet and the Gradle script won&#x27;t compile.  If gradle was interpreted this problem wouldn&#x27;t exist....<p>I find the DSL unintuitive and the inability to specify the order of tasks execution is always a sore point.<p>On the positive, at least it&#x27;s a language, not XML.  I have never understood the java world&#x27;s obsession with XML and forcing it in directions never intended.  This XML obsession has led to java being a major laggard in automation tech.

It&#x27;s just pork that can&#x27;t be cut because defense spending is a sacred cow, because defense contractors are huge campaign contributors. Otherwise we could cut the fat and leave the meat.<p>> Historically, defense spending has been the core of our public R&D spending<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is an argument for defense spending. There is no requirement that R&D be done under the auspices of the military. And at a given level of R&D spending, classifying it as defense spending leads to more funding for extravagant weapons systems and less funding for fusion power and solar thermal and other actually useful things.<p>> Defense spending creates jobs in the U.S. that are difficult to outsource.<p>This is similarly not an argument for defense spending, it&#x27;s an argument for federal programs that employ Americans. Why not pay people the same money to repair the infrastructure at home instead of blowing up the infrastructure in the middle east?<p>> Would it be politically advantageous to spend less on defense and more on alternative energy? Not if you&#x27;re a politician in Maryland or Georgia or Texas or Alabama whose constituents depend on the jobs created by that spending.<p>But you&#x27;re not spending less money, you&#x27;re just spending it on different things. Why should a Senator from Texas prefer allocating a billion dollars to a defense contractor in Texas over allocating the same billion dollars and hiring the same number of people for alternative energy research also in Texas, except that the defense contractor has more money to donate to his campaign than the university?<p>Obviously a Senator from one state will be unhappy to see money moved from that state to a different one, but that comes out in the wash. Either the Senator from Texas loses a defense contract and gains an experimental fusion reactor site, or the money goes from e.g. Texas to California and the bill passes with the vote of the Senator from California instead of the Senator from Texas.<p>> The Senator from Georgia votes in favor of more defense spending because Lockheed-Martin CEO reminded him, using donations and lobbying, that he employs thousands of middle class people in his state.<p>Do you not see how that can distort the policies adopted? The effects of some policies are diffuse and affect people not naturally organized to defend their interests. Allowing campaign contributions to determine policy creates a preference for organized special interests over the general public and for large organizations over smaller ones.<p>Here&#x27;s the naked extreme example: Paul wants the government to tax a hundred million people one dollar each and give it all to Paul. Absent campaign contributions, no representatives pay any attention to Paul because that&#x27;s a ridiculous policy. Enter campaign contributions, Paul pays a couple million dollars to several representatives in exchange for a hundred million dollar return, and the people being fleeced are too busy to concern themselves with such a small amount of money at the individual level, so the representatives benefit from passing Paul&#x27;s policy. Repeat thousands of times with various degrees of rationalization for the corruption and you get the Federal budget.",1398976103

Let&#x27;s say your preference is &quot;I don&#x27;t want to talk to this person.&quot;  That cannot be said politely!  Notice instead to make it polite you had to recast it -- &quot;I would rather be doing X rather than talking to this person.&quot;  That is not an obvious transformation, and it&#x27;s not helpful to go around saying that it&#x27;s &quot;simple&quot;.  Instead you could give explicitly the advice that you&#x27;ve given implicitly: Take your preference not to talk to the person, and recast it as a desire to do X (where X doesn&#x27;t include talking to the person).<p>Now, you may point out that these two preferences are extensionally equivalent.

My point is it is <i>not</i> as simple as &quot;just politely communicate your feelings, preferences/and or needs&quot;, often because doing so is impossible without violating other social constraints.

7682486,comment,7680607,7682072,1,0,pdabbadabba,,,"I disagree. (Obviously, since I submitted the article.) The regulatory debate about Airbnb in New York as I had always heard it framed was about &quot;outdated&quot; hospitality regulations that needed to be &quot;updated&quot; to accommodate the sharing economy. In this context, I think it is widely assumed that the New York regulations are focused on sanitation, safety, etc. concerns for hotel guests. What this points out is that, in reality, the hospitality laws (at least in part) serve to prevent the extremely high demand for hotel rooms in new York City from gobbling up large chunks of housing inventory, thus driving up already-astronomical housing prices. Hence the ban on renting out whole apartments, or single rooms for more than 30 days: this sort of space could plausibly be used as residential housing for New Yorkers. New York would rather this capacity be sold on the residential housing market than made available for tourists on Airbnb. A person might disagree with this policy goal, but it does not strike me as archaic or obviously stupid.<p>Also, it is written by &quot;the Editorial Board.&quot; That is, it is the &quot;official&quot; position of the newspaper.

I think the two would be a great combo.  Though I like the philosophy of immutable containers that Docker asserts, where if the topography needs to be reogranized (with linking containers [1]), you can just tear them down and spin them back up in a second.  In practice this is kind of a pain, and a very top down view.  Using Consul would make it very nice for snapping together infrastructure, with more robustness provided, i.e. health checks & discovery.<p>As a side note, I played around with Ubuntu&#x27;s Juju a bit, and they also allow you to change an instance&#x27;s configuration during runtime.

7682416,comment,7680828,7682231,12,0,metadept,,,"Interesting points, but I don&#x27;t think the lack of privacy in a small community is very similar to the lack of privacy in a large surveillance ecosystem. If the concern is over the ability to have secrets at all (i.e. to know facts that are unknown to others) then the metaphor works. The problem is that it&#x27;s not about personal insult or embarrassment, it&#x27;s about a larger power disparity.<p>In a small town, the lack of secrecy is (generally) mutual. People are aware of the reputation they gain and can usually address any rumors or allegations directly. Furthermore, there&#x27;s still the option to physically move away, and one can presume that there will be other communities to join while leaving behind social baggage.<p>When it comes to the internet, the metaphor breaks down. Most people are (by design) unaware of the degree or even the presence of surveillance around them. The parties collecting the information (corporations, government agencies, and a few individuals) remain unknown, and their motivations reach far beyond those of rumormongers or gossips. Because they don&#x27;t share in the same small community, the powers that watch us don&#x27;t have to fear direct or indirect repercussions from the ways they use our data for or against us. This should be much scarier than any threat of individual antagonism or public shame.<p>There&#x27;s also no effective way to &#x27;leave&#x27; the internet. As this article illustrates, it&#x27;s difficult or impossible to avoid revealing even a single specific piece of information, let alone your whole identity. It&#x27;s more than the fact that we &quot;really like&quot; our involvement in the online community, it&#x27;s a necessity for the vast majority of us to sustain ourselves socially and financially. We will inevitably reveal many things about ourselves by our actions online, and this data will never disappear.<p>I agree that we need to move forward from the way things are rather than trying to back out at this late hour. However, I very much disagree that this is in any way comparable to the way things have been, or a reemergence of previous societal trends. This is a new problem created from our many advancements, and we need to find new ways to address it.",1398974904

This was because if you wanted to stay anonymous online and actually buy things, you need to purchase gift cards with cash. The place she went (or her husband did) to purchase multiple gift cards had a sign that said something like they&#x27;re watching people that buy a lot of gift cards.<p>You&#x27;re response sounds more like a marketing brochure to me. While I love tech and am in the tech world, the fact is, mine and everyone&#x27;s private info is out there for anyone to buy and many companies to sell. Sure, we can make tools (some day) to put the equation in our favor, but this is not that day. Simply saying we can use Tor/private browsing/avoid social media is only part of it. Actually buying things not in cash leaves a trail and that info is sold to whomever pays.<p>Regardless if you could easily find out in the 1700&#x27;s if someone was pregnant, the article was not a commentary on the past. It was about opting out in the present, which is pretty much impossible if you use any kind of connected technology in your daily life. Be it your atm/credit card, phone, internet connection - they all leave trails.<p>Sure, in the 1700&#x27;s a butcher would see your face and maybe remember it. Maybe retain enough info to track you down if need be. But now, it&#x27;s more than absolute. The more everything becomes digitized, the less anyone can be anonymous. You&#x27;d have to really be into the spy mindset to cover your tracks and do the things that would need to be done to get false ids, etc. And I don&#x27;t know how much that would even help as machine learning and face recognition (coupled with ccd&#x27;s everywhere) get better and could probably link up those fake ids.<p>Honestly, I don&#x27;t care much because I&#x27;m not a very important or interesting person. So in a sense that way, I have some anonymity. And I love tech (still).
