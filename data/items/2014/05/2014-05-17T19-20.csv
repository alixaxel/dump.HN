7760884,comment,7757666,7758359,1,0,smsm42,,,"So let me understand this. The government wants to have everybody to have fast internet, regardless of the ability to pay for it. The government does not have the clout to force the taxpayers to pay for it collectively (e.g. by raising taxes) so it tries to make providers to pay for it by building out. The providers don&#x27;t go for it, so nobody has fast internet at all. Yeah, sounds logical, I don&#x27;t see any easy solution for it.<p>Except, you know, for the government to stop being control freaks for a minute, let the people that can pay to pay, and as the cost of basic service eventually and inevitably drops have more and more people enjoy it. Of course, that means that somebody who doesn&#x27;t have any money wouldn&#x27;t be able to enjoy the fastest broadband service available on the market, so if it&#x27;s absolutely imperative everybody would be equal - the solution is always the same, the lowest common denominator.<p>There is an easy solution, you just should be willing to see it.",1400356775

They certainly try to convince people that you have to buy GNAT Pro if you want to build non-GPL compatible software.<p>Based on the other comments here, it seems it is actually possible to use GNAT, with an alternative FSF runtime,  to build non-GPL compatible software without a license. Great, however AdaCore certainly likes to keep quiet about that possibility (for understandable reasons). Also as a potential user I would be worried about the quality of said runtime, given that it probably has no serious users and very little manpower behind it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://libre.adacore.com/tools/gnat-gpl-edition/faq/#licensing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://libre.adacore.com/tools/gnat-gpl-edition/faq/#licensi...</a>",1400356679

Even to this day, I don&#x27;t actually know how to go about gaining social skills or what those skills actually are.</i><p>Here&#x27;s a few things I picked up along the way:<p>1) Regarding small talk, don&#x27;t be afraid to talk BS inconsequential stuff. Not every conversation has to be productive or have a deeper meaning.<p>2) As you say, everybody in a conversation has to feel included. If someone from in your company is not familiar with a subject, narrow it down and provide context, or drop it.<p>3) Avoid being too preachy and teacher-like. It&#x27;s OK they don&#x27;t know X fact, even if you feel everybody should know about it (e.g someone not knowing who Bob Dylan is or that the web is not the same as the internet). Also, unless they look deeply interested in you explaining it, they probabky are not.<p>4) Laugh at other people&#x27;s jokes, even if they are not that good. Put in a few jokes yourself, especially some that don&#x27;t require special knowledge. Not all jokes have to be inside jokes (something we nerds usually are guilty of).<p>5) Empathy trumps everything. Try to feel the other&#x27;s pain. Discussing thermodynamics or Haskell is good, but if the other guy is currently concerned about his health problem or just had a spouse abandon them, talk about that too. That includes conversations between nerds too.",1400355551
