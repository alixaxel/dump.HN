It&#x27;s just that the tax falls on the (shareholders of) broadband companies, who are presumably not, for the most part, local residents.  The reason this is more politically feasible is not that it isn&#x27;t a tax, but that the tax is not being levied on voters.  Or does the name matter that much?",1400295574
7759110,comment,7757666,7758409,2,0,mikeyouse,,,"Apologies if my earlier post was unclear, I deleted a few sections in favor of brevity but it was left confusing.<p>The spectrum giveaway to broadcasters was predicated on &#x27;Universal Service&#x27; being supplied by telecom companies.[1] That digital TV spectrum would be immensely valuable for wireless communication today, so it should absolutely be considered  a subsidy as a result of the Telecom Act.<p>The more direct subsidies come from many other places. A good place to start is the Universal Service Fund[2]. Every landline bill, every cable bill, every mobile phone bill has a line item for &quot;Universal Service&quot; on it. These funds are collected from consumers then &#x27;disbursed&#x27; to companies for them to provide service extensions. This has been happening since 1997.  They&#x27;ve disbursed over $80B back to telecom companies as part of the telecom act, the GAO isn&#x27;t too impressed with how it was being spent.[3] Besides the direct subsidies, they got favorable depreciation schedules, and tax relief.<p>The oddly interesting Robert Cringely did a special for PBS on the mess, which is probably the origin of the $200B number[4]:<p><pre><code>    Over the decade from 1994-2004 the major telephone companies profited\n    from higher phone rates paid by all of us, accelerated depreciation\n    on their networks, and direct tax credits an average of $2,000 per\n    subscriber for which the companies delivered precisely nothing in terms\n    of service to customers. That&#x27;s $200 billion with nothing to be shown for it.\n\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] - <a href=""http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-handbook-policymakers/2003/9/hb108-41.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/ca...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/modules/ereport/handler.php?1=1&path=/ereport/GAO-11-318SP/data_center_savings/Economic_development/Improved_design_and_management_of_the_universal_service_fund_as_it_expands_to_support_broadband_could_help_avoid_cost_increases_for_consumers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gao.gov/modules/ereport/handler.php?1=1&path=/ere...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070810_002683.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070810_0026...</a>",1400295554

7759099,comment,7758406,7758824,14,0,vwinsyee,,,"The FDA has more than likely <i>directly</i> prevented hundreds of millions deaths worldwide. It&#x27;s literally one of very few safeguards you can rely on to know that you&#x27;re not eating poison.<p>Amusingly, the top comment on a front page HN post [1] right now concerns one of the first court cases [2] that gave FDA some real power. Before this case, companies could sell a poison like emetic tartar and market it as a hangover drug. Selling stuff like this still happens today in countries without an FDA equivalent. [3] It even happens in countries with a drug regulatory body, but one that&#x27;s weak. [4]<p>As with all regulation, there&#x27;s a balance between benefit/risk. As you point out, there is a financial and time burden of regulation. But with warts and all, the work that the FDA has done and currently does far outweighs these burdens.<p><i>> The only good thing I can find to say about the bureaucrats at the FDA is that they respond to regional regulatory arbitrage - to medical tourism - by loosening their grip and letting things through. Or at least they do when said treatments are so widely available elsewhere in the world that the risk of looking bad by continuing to block them in the US is worse than the risk of looking bad because one of the outcomes of a normal, low error rate in medicine gets picked up by the press. Look at simple stem cell transplants, now available in the US these last couple of years, for a good example of this in practice.</i><p>I&#x27;m not quite sure how to respond to this rant. But I&#x27;ll point out findings from a 2012 NEJM study comparing the FDA to the EU&#x27;s EMA and Canada&#x27;s Health Canada: [5]<p>&quot;RESULTS: There were 510 applications for novel therapeutic agents approved from 2001 through 2010 — 225 by the FDA, 186 by the EMA, and 99 by Health Canada; among the applications, there were 289 unique agents. The median length of time for completion of the first review was 303 days (interquartile range, 185 to 372) for applications approved by the FDA, 366 days (interquartile range, 310 to 445) for those approved by the EMA, and 352 days (interquartile range, 255 to 420) for those approved by Health Canada (P<0.001 for the comparison across the three agencies). The median total review time was also shorter at the FDA than at the EMA or Health Canada (P=0.002). Among the 289 unique novel therapeutic agents, 190 were approved in both the United States and Europe (either by the EMA or through the mutual recognition process), of which 121 (63.7%) were first approved in the United States; similarly, 154 were approved in both the United States and Canada, of which 132 (85.7%) were first approved in the United States.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7758508"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7758508</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._11_1/4_Dozen_Packages_of_Articles_Labeled_in_Part_Mrs._Moffat%E2%80%99s_Shoo-Fly_Powders_for_Drunkenness"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._11_1/4_Dozen_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://ijp-online.com/article.asp?issn=0253-7613;year=2007;volume=39;issue=4;spage=206;epage=207;aulast=Khan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ijp-online.com/article.asp?issn=0253-7613;year=2007;v...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1151014/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1151014/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1200223"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1200223</a>",1400295149

7759064,comment,7754772,7756528,3,0,orionblastar,,,"In 1986 I had an Amiga 1000 in the USA at the University of Missouri Rolla.<p>I bought the 1020 5.25&quot; Floppy drive and PC-Transformer software to run PC-DOS 2.0 on it for my Turbo Pascal class.<p>I also bought something called AMax which had a parallel port dongle that contained a Macintosh ROM (Since a lot of Apple Macintosh systems were defective at the time and prone to overheating until the Mac II series fixed that, the market was flooded with Mac parts like motherboards and ROM chips) that allowed the 68000 based Amiga 1000 to boot Macintosh Floppy disks and run the Macintosh System and Mac games and software on it. At first it lacked sound, but after an update it got fixed. Amaz using the Amiga coprocessors was able to run the Macintosh System faster than a real Macintosh. The Atari ST had something just like it called the Magic Sack.<p>I even had a Commodore 64 and Apple // emulator that could use the 1020 drive to run software for those systems.<p>The Amiga and Atari ST did a lot of emulation back in the day, because they used the coprocessors to emulate some of the older systems.<p>Everyone in my fraternity laughed at me for owning a Commodore instead of a real computer like an IBM PC or Macintosh. I told them I could run IBM PC and Macintosh software with my Amiga and it cost half if not three times less than their systems. They still had the image of the old Commodore 64 and the slow 1541 floppy drive. In the USA Commodore was seen as a &#x27;toy computer company&#x27; and so was Atari, because they sold their 8 bit computers really cheap in toy stores and department stores instead of computer stores like the PC clones and the Apple computers.<p>Commodore and Atari did better marketing in Europe but in the USA, not much was done. I do recall they advertised in magazines about the Amiga and Atari ST, but they should have advertised in Byte and PC Magazine and other magazines not about their own computers to reach new markets.<p>I remember Commodore made PC Clones running MS-DOS called the Commodore Colt series. &quot;It&#x27;s not a clone, it&#x27;s a Commodore!&quot; was a bad slogan. Everyone thought it was based on the Commodore 128 or something that had flopped. The Commodore 128 was cool because it had a Z80 coprocessor for CP/M-80 mode, and the 8510 CPU ran faster in 128 mode, but most people used Commodore 64 mode and bought the 128 to replace a broke 64.<p>Commodore made the Plus4 and Commodore 16 series to compete with the Atari 800XL and ect, but had changed the interface for devices to try and force everyone to buy new ones and so it failed. They dumped the whole lot really cheap in Mexico where it did quite well selling for under $100 in super markets. It was a waste of time, they should have spent that money on making the Amiga series better and making better PC Clones that used the Amiga coprocessors to speed up MS-DOS and Windows programs.<p>The Amiga 2000/3000/4000 had these Zorro slots that took IBM PC bridgecards that used 8088, 80286, 80386 chips with a PC on a card that ran MS-DOS and Windows in an AmigaOS Window, and the motherboards had ISA slots for the bridgecard to use PC expansion cards and even use them in AmigaOS mode as well.<p>The Macintosh didn&#x27;t have a better user experience, instead it had better marketing and a better reputation in the USA than the Amiga and Atari ST. The Macintosh II series competed with Commodore and Atari better, and then IBM made the PS/2 series and OS/2 with Microsoft. The Amiga and Atari ST still ran things faster and were better and did true preemtive mutlitasking which the Macintosh and PC Clones could not even do. Apple tried to kill the Amiga and Atari ST with Copeland but it was vaporware. Microsoft and IBM tried to kill them with OS/2, but Microsoft stabbed IBM in the back and made Windows 95 that stole a lot of business from Apple, Commodore, and Atari. Around that time Linux was just getting popular, and it ran rings around the Amiga and Atari ST, it was free and ran on PC Clones and did true preemptive multitasking even better.<p>I remember in 1995 putting my Amiga 1000 in a closet while I got a 486DX 50Mhz PC Clone dual booting Windows 95 and Slackware Linux. I really wanted to buy a faster Amiga, but the PC Clones became so cheap it was cheaper to buy a PC clone. My Amiga 1000 had shot craps after Nine years of service some keys didn&#x27;t work on the keyboard and the floppy drive had malfunctioned. The cost of a new floppy drive and keyboard was too much, I&#x27;d rather put the money towards a PC Clone.<p>I had tried BeOS for Intel as well. I had IBM OS/2 2.0 and when I got OS/2 3.0 Warp my CD-ROM drive wasn&#x27;t supported so I went back to Windows 95 and Linux that did support my CD-ROM drive.<p>Haiku is a good operating system, I run it in Virtual Box, you have to enable a serial port or it crashes during boot.<p>I have to say people who used to love the Commodore Amiga ought to check out AROS instead: <a href=""http://aros.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aros.sourceforge.net/</a><p>It might bring back some memories.",1400294322

It is difficult to estimate how many lives the post-1962 FDA controls have cost, but the number is likely to be substantial; Gieringer (1985) estimates the loss of life from delay alone to be in the hundreds of thousands (not to mention millions of patients who endured unnecessary morbidity). When we look back to the pre-1962 period, do we find anything like this tragedy? The historical record—decades of a relatively free market up to 1962—shows that voluntary institutions, the tort system, and the pre-1962 FDA succeeded in keeping unsafe drugs to a low level. The Elixir Sulfanilamide tragedy, in which 107 people died, was the worst of those decades. Every life lost is important, but the grisly comparison is necessary. The number of victims of Elixir Sulfanilamide tragedy and of all other drug tragedies prior to 1962 is very small compared to the death toll of the post-1962 FDA.",1400293757

A developer of will notice important differences in Java vs. Android.<p>To explain some more with my photograph comment: the photograph might have taken time and context and thought on behalf of an entire population of viewers to come to some &quot;meaning&quot;; maybe this is more obvious if we take a storyline from a popular television show: before the show people didn&#x27;t care about the topic of the show, but after the investment, quality, and success of the show now people really like that topics and in particular the story progression that went along with it.<p>People are familiar with that story: to really allow those people to feel good about the new story, maybe it has to be similar to the old one? If you go down this path for a while, you start reading about idea/expression differences as they apply to literary and visual works: high-level plots and themes are not protected, but specific details and timelines are. The idea of organizing code into packages and classes is not, but the specific choice of what classes to put in what packages and what they are named are.<p>FWIW, I personally feel like a lot of the benefit of trying to be &quot;interoperable&quot; with someone&#x27;s perception of how to program is sufficient to be at that higher &quot;idea&quot; level: when I use C# or Objective-C (which in many ways feel similar to Java and in the case of C# was pretty much designed as a direct replacement for Java) I am highly familiar with them despite not feeling like they are the same: I gain a lot of the benefit of C# and Java having similar ideas, despite the fact that they clearly have different expressions.<p>Now, that said? I continue to appreciate the idea that this is all a stupid distinction: but if you erase this distinction I am not certain where you still draw the line for claiming copyright on anything. Given the idea &quot;investment in expression should be protected&quot; (an admittedly-oversimplified version of &quot;copyright&quot;), I don&#x27;t think you still have &quot;investment by consumers in content should be inherently reusable by other creators&quot;.

As someone in the very early stages of trying to start my own business (technical founder), this type of thing sounds interesting, but 8-10 weeks of a full immersion program is just too much. Even if I had the time and the money to attend a rigorous 2 month bootcamp, I have a hard time believing that would be a good use of my time. Something more tailored to a part time schedule would be more interesting to me, and even then it would be a tough sell.<p>But if you do decide to push ahead with it, good luck. I do think there&#x27;s probably room for this type of thing targeted to sales people if you can deliver the goods. I&#x27;ve only known a few people in sales, but it truly is a wonderful sight to see a pro work his magic.",1400292158

Two things fixed it:<p>1) Flipping the unit on its side so that the power button is facing me and the wires stick up in the air. Apparently the original run units had a metal base which affected signal from the antenna.<p>2) Switching the Bluetooth controllers to get the priority no matter if there&#x27;s a game downloading or not. This feature/option was included in a recent update and you can find it in the Controllers->Settings menu.<p>I have a chocolate brown Kickstarter-backer model and I no longer get controller lag.",1400292157

The broadcasters were gifted the spectrum largely because it was assumed that we&#x27;d have universal broadband by the time of the HD rollout. They&#x27;re not causally linked, but the spectrum being swallowed by the broadcasters is a side-affect of the same nonsense.<p>A copy/paste from my other comment:<p>The more direct subsidies come from many other places. A good place to start is the Universal Service Fund[2]. Every landline bill, every cable bill, every mobile phone bill has a line item for &quot;Universal Service&quot; on it. These funds are collected from consumers then &#x27;disbursed&#x27; to companies for them to provide service extensions. This has been happening since 1997.  They&#x27;ve disbursed over $80B back to telecom companies as part of the telecom act, the GAO isn&#x27;t too impressed with how it was being spent.[3] Besides the direct subsidies, they got favorable depreciation schedules,<p>The oddly interesting Robert Cringely did a special for PBS on the mess, which is probably the origin of the $200B number[4]:<p><pre><code>    Over the decade from 1994-2004 the major telephone companies profited\n    from higher phone rates paid by all of us, accelerated depreciation\n    on their networks, and direct tax credits an average of $2,000 per\n    subscriber for which the companies delivered precisely nothing in terms\n    of service to customers. That&#x27;s $200 billion with nothing to be shown for it.\n\n\n</code></pre>\n[1] - <a href=""http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-handbook-policymakers/2003/9/hb108-41.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/ca...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Service_Fund</a><p>[3] - <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/modules/ereport/handler.php?1=1&path=/ereport/GAO-11-318SP/data_center_savings/Economic_development/Improved_design_and_management_of_the_universal_service_fund_as_it_expands_to_support_broadband_could_help_avoid_cost_increases_for_consumers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gao.gov/modules/ereport/handler.php?1=1&path=/ere...</a><p>[4] - <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070810_002683.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2007/pulpit_20070810_0026...</a>",1400292040
