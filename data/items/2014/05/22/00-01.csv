If we&#x27;re to have any real competition between countries to improve their governance, entrepreneurs have to vote with their feet and actually move to the countries with the best policies. Only then, when governments realise that they&#x27;re missing out on tax revenue, will they be motivated to change for the better.",1400720399

The question is then raised as to why you&#x27;d spend that much time watching a series if you didn&#x27;t like what you saw of it to start with, and responses which talk about how great The Wire is once you put a lot of time into it are then entirely missing the point.",1400720304

This is a strength and a weakness. I was enamored to Smalltalk early on (back in 95 when I learned it in a course) for this very reason. But then the Internet was happening, the world of computing became a lot more heterogeneous, and the idea of a mostly uniform world of computing mostly faded away.<p>> I mean what could be possibly have been wrong with Smalltalk when the IBM&#x27;s first Java implementations and IDEs were built with Smalltalk<p>It was handy after IBM&#x27;s acquisition of OTI.<p>> Sun bought out the company which developed one the fastest Smalltalk implementations to put their developers into creating Java?<p>This is inaccurate. Animorphic was bought out for its compiler technology to improve Java; Java was already invented at that point.<p>> It would be better if there was one vision and one implementation that they all focused on.<p>Developers are moving on to new things. There is Dart of course (if we are talking about developers of smalltalk), and Kay&#x27;s VPRI which are attempting to develop the next best thing.",1400720256

7781582,comment,7781117,7781117,9,0,drewcrawford,,,"I was doing some background research for another essay and this is as good a time as any to produce an actual journal article on point.<p>There&#x27;s a common talking point I&#x27;ve seen both in this comment thread and elsewhere that the number of entrants isn&#x27;t the problem at all and the <i>real</i> problem is game developers aren&#x27;t innovating, and if they just innovated more things would be fine.<p>Kevin Boudreau [1] is one of the earliest researches on this scene, who concludes that &quot;incremental increases in the number of application producers in this context led to a decrease in innovation incentives, on average, as measured by the rate at which new versions of existing titles were generated&quot; and further that &quot;the strength of descriptive patterns alone suggests that marginal entrants curtailed overall innovation&quot;.<p>Kevin&#x27;s research, while it has many limitations, suggests that innovation decline is actually a symptom of an overcrowded market, not an independent factor in its own right.  If true, this could mean that the practical way to address an innovation crisis is to first solve the problem of the overcrowded market.<p>The idea that market crowding depresses the innovation of individual independent developers is sort of a surprising result, but once accepted there are many possible feedback mechanisms that may explain the effect.  For example, market crowding may drive innovators to go innovate somewhere else.  Crowding may also limit available funding which may be disproportionately required by innovative titles rather than non-innovative titles which can be more cheaply manufactured.<p>[1] preprint: <a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=%201826702"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=%20182670...</a><p>jstor: <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/23252315?searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Diphone%2Bsoftware%2Bengineering%26amp%3Bprq%3Diphone%26amp%3Bhp%3D25%26amp%3Bacc%3Doff%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bso%3Drel%26amp%3Bracc%3Doff&resultItemClick=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/23252315?searchUri=%2F...</a>",1400720126

Well, the lawn doesn&#x27;t have seats, you know what I mean.<p>I was pretty good at Guitar Hero. I recently checked, and I&#x27;m still 8,884th on Guitar Hero II for XBox Live, out of 2.3 million. So when I heard this tournament was happening, I was in. I spent hours practicing extra hard. First round was at a local bar, and you had to be the Nth caller to the local radio station to get a spot. Through some persistence, I made it happen. Lots of the people weren&#x27;t even that great, one guy had never even played before. I ended up winning that pretty handily. They held a ton more of these preliminary tournaments, and then 16 (I think) of us got free tickets to the tour. Woo!<p>Showing up, there was a tent where people could play Guitar Hero. We held another elimination tournament there, with the top two facing off on main stage. A friend that I knew from the competitive Guitar Hero forums and I had both brought cheat sheets with the optimal star power patterns on them. Such nerds. We were the only ones who did, and we pretty handily wiped up everyone else.<p>So, he and I got to play &quot;Killing in the Name&quot; by Rage Against the Machine on main stage, winner got a real guitar and to hang out with Korn.

For combustion, you&#x27;re taking chemical bonds of high potential energy, breaking them apart, and rearranging the atoms into molecules with chemical bonds of lower potential energy. The energy difference is the heat produced by the combustion. The situation is similar in batteries, but in addition to rearranging atoms, free electrons are also liberated or consumed, with the bond energy difference going into that. For something like a mechanical spring, the winding force distorts the chemical bonds without breaking them, treating them like extremely tiny springs, with the same principle of operation as the big one. In all cases, the chemical bond strength determines how much potential energy can be crammed into the system.<p>For example, Wikipedia claims that flywheel energy storage (a &quot;battery&quot; where you just spin a disc faster to put energy in, and use it to drive something to get energy out) tops out at about 400Wh/kg. Lithium-ion batteries top out around 250Wh/kg, somewhat similar. Gasoline has a vastly better energy density at around 12,000Wh/kg... but gasoline needs to react with oxygen to release that energy! In fact it needs to react in an approximately 4:1 ratio, so the total mass going into the reaction is 5x the mass of the gasoline alone, making for an energy density of about 2400Wh/kg. Still much higher than batteries, but not outlandishly higher. I believe the difference would be because it&#x27;s much easier to turn strong chemical bonds with a lot of potential energy into heat than it is to turn it into electrical potential.<p>You can see how reacting with the air gets you a huge advantage when it comes to how much stuff you need to carry around with you to store any given quantity of energy. And you can also sort of see how they all end up hitting the same basic limitations in the end. If you want to go further, you need take advantage of a stronger force with more potential energy, like the strong nuclear force.<p>(Gravity would be another possibility. If you could store energy by raising and lowering the orbit of a heavy object orbiting close to the Sun, you could get a pretty high energy density.

It&#x27;s easy to be idealistic about his sort of thing as a consumer, but if you do as a producer then you will go broke. And while one shouldn&#x27;t be too cynical (otherwise you might just as well take up accountancy or some other line of work), it&#x27;s a fact that consumers are a fickle bunch - they like novelty but not always originality.<p>I came across some good advice last week (aimed at designers, but relevant here): being 20 years ahead of your audience is not a recipe for success - people will just think you are strange. Being 20 minutes ahead, however, can pay off big.<p>For all their faults, this is something publishers understand well, and historically they have done a fairly good job of curating the authors they publish so as to support the ones that are a little too far ahead of the curve. They also look after a great deal of stuff that artists are either not good at or don&#x27;t like, like marketing, accountancy and so on - so artists get to focus on what they do well rather than having to deal with the business stuff.<p>It&#x27;s nice to think about art as being above commercial considerations, but being an artist doesn&#x27;t get you out of paying rent or buying food or whatever family obligations you may have (which is why a lot of artists have precarious domestic arrangements). Even determinedly un-commercial firms like ThatGameCompany struggle with this; <i>Journey</i> was supposed to take one year but took three, and they ran out of money and couldn&#x27;t make payroll in the third year so they had to let some people go and make others wait months to get paid. You often can&#x27;t ignore commercial considerations becuas if what you want to do needs money then either you raise it or the work doesn&#x27;t get made.

The feeling I get from sinking an evening into a short and sweet game is kind of similar to reading a good book or playing a good chess match. Likewise, the feeling I get from sinking an evening into a longer game is some artificial feeling of making progress.<p>I&#x27;m overgeneralizing a little, but the point is I&#x27;ve started skipping AAA titles in favor of trying out lots of indie games.

It seems to be the gold standard for any iOS app that makes web calls, to the point where it&#x27;s practically a default first step when making a new project for many programmers. Me, I don&#x27;t understand the appeal. The cost is enormous due to adding a huge quantity of code (and therefore bugs) to your app, and the benefit over using what Apple provides is tiny.<p>If the cost/benefit tradeoff appears worthwhile, taking into account the large cost from adding any third-party code, I&#x27;m happy to make it. It just doesn&#x27;t happen very often.<p>To me, CocoaPods doesn&#x27;t move the needle on the cost/benefit tradeoff, because the cost of what CocoaPods handles is extremely small compared to the total.
