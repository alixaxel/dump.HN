I&#x27;ve done several reviews of software solutions which have used bit.ly and other shortening services for things like providing a link to corporate identity portals.<p>It&#x27;s quite common for a company to want to use their own identity portal for employee authentication with a particular piece of software and a few companies implement this via giving users shortened links which resolve to the identity portal location.  They will hardcode the request to bit.ly & then give the users the token to enter when the software starts.  It will then send the full bit.ly request and get a destination location back for the portal.<p>In every case I&#x27;ve seen this, I&#x27;ve written it as a high risk finding since neither the software vendor nor the company using the solution has ever done an audit of the security controls at bit.ly or the other link shortening services.  If a link shortening company like bit.ly is compromised & a bad guy is able to modify link destinations then it&#x27;s pretty much over in terms of security for a software solution implementing this model.

Of course blaming the new UI is a real crowd-pleaser, as can be seen in the HN comments, which must be good for getting some page hits on a Saturday afternoon.<p>The reality is that Google Maps has always had a (frequently changing) set of searches producing bad results. Some of those failures would have been much more visible, widely publicized, and serious than a blogger not finding the closest burger joint.

I actually had to use Bing Maps today to look up some directions because the new version of Google Maps was pretty much unusable.<p>As for why UX disasters like this can happen, I think it generally comes down to one thing these days: &quot;hipsters&quot;.<p>Those of us who&#x27;ve been in industry for a long time have no doubt seen this happen before. A relatively well-established product has a usable UI. It isn&#x27;t perfect, and maybe even looks &quot;dated&quot; in some ways, but it generally works and is understood by its existing users.<p>So-called &quot;hipsters&quot; (that is, people who have an uncompromising view that they&#x27;re talented &quot;designers&quot; or &quot;UI experts&quot;, with a massive ego to back this up, and a fixation on being &quot;trendy&quot;) get involved at some point. These people are often relatively young, often have limited experience, and are usually more focused on making designs look &quot;pretty&quot; and &quot;modern&quot; rather than usable.<p>Needing to create work for themselves, these hipsters, coupled with managers who need to appear to be leading something seen as &quot;productive&quot;, start on a UI redesign. Often this is done without the involvement or insight offered by the existing developers of the product, nor any of the product&#x27;s users. Changes are made purely to look &quot;better&quot;, with limited to no consideration of how it&#x27;ll impact the usability of the product.<p>The end result is a total cock-up like this, or like the poor UI of Chrome (and the imitations of it by Firefox, Opera and IE), or a project-killing release like GNOME 3, or an abysmal failure like Windows 8.<p>UIs were generally far more usable in the 1980s, 1990s, and the first half of the 2000s, before &quot;hipsters&quot; got involved with design.

Right now etcd ties into fleet very tightly.<p>If you stopped etcd on all your CoreOS nodes, installed consul, and had all of your CoreOS systemd units register with consul (say, with an ExecStartPre step), you&#x27;d technically be &#x27;running CoreOS with Consul&#x27; - but fleet would be just straight up broken without etcd, meaning there&#x27;d be no way to submit units to different nodes in your cluster, or view logs, or really manage the cluster at all.<p>Looking at the fleet source code (<a href=""https://github.com/coreos/fleet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/coreos/fleet</a>), it looks like swapping out etcd for consul would take a lot more effort than &#x27;sed -i -e &#x27;s/etcd/consul/g&#x27; *.go&#x27;.

7725415,comment,7724100,7724100,2,0,joesmo,,,"&quot;For reference, the US Poverty Line is $11,670 ... The net result of these problems means that the official US Poverty rate is not really sensible measurement of poverty in the US. ... So implementing Basic Income at this amount [$12,000] would immediately eliminate poverty in the US.&quot;<p>This doesn&#x27;t make sense. The current poverty line is two to three times below what it should be. Implementing a $12k a year basic income would only end poverty in theory based on the current definition and amount which is &quot;not really sensible measurement of poverty in the US.&quot; It&#x27;s impossible to deduce which of the mutually exclusive statements the authors agree with, although it seems to be that that the current US Poverty rate is actually a very accurate measurement of poverty in the US, off by only $330 from what is &quot;not poverty.&quot;<p>&quot;We feel there is very little necessary transportation today that is not related to work or entertainment, so is therefore excluded.&quot;<p>So this idea is based on the assumption that people on basic income <i>should</i> forget about finding a job in most of America, at least the parts without free or low-cost mass transit (pretty much all of it). Most of these people will never have a chance to work again. What about trips to the doctor or the supermarket. The authors are just completely out of touch with American reality here.",1399730646

They whacked on Hachette a couple of years ago in the UK (delisting titles on amazon.co.uk) -- I&#x27;m told that what made Amazon back down was Charlaine Harris&#x27;s Sookie Stackhouse series of all things. (The TV series was running, all the books were in the top 30 bestsellers, and it wound up costing Amazon a fortune.)<p>They&#x27;ve also done this to Macmillan and Penguin, to my knowledge.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the Big Five publishers in the US have a combined turnover about a fifth of Amazon&#x27;s, and individually none of them are even 10% of Amazon&#x27;s size. Amazon&#x27;s behavior towards its suppliers is basically bullying -- this isn&#x27;t just in publishing -- and they&#x27;re also tax dodgers (although I note the UK treasury has finally taken steps to close the VAT loophole they were exploiting to charge their suppliers 20% VAT while paying out only 3% to the Luxembourg government).",1399730544
