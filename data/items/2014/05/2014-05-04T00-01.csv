7692919,comment,7691332,7692879,6,0,smsm42,,,"You quite underestimate the number of COBOL jobs. E.g. simple search [1] reveals thousands of COBOL jobs just on one site, and most of these jobs I imagine would not be even advertised on generic job-search sites since these go through consulting firms which already know who they can hire. Deeper research shows there are millions of COBOL programmers now [2] and massive numbers of COBOL applications still in business. Actually, as traditional COBOL programmers start retiring and banks and hedge funds still being in business, programming COBOL may become very very lucrative market, paying very much better than your average Ruby or Java gig.<p>>>> newer stuff is coming out faster and faster.<p>I see no indication of this. Actually, most of the things that were with us 10 years ago are still around, and introduction of paradigm-shifting concepts massively slowed down due to massive size of the market which would not allow quick change and incurs massive legacy costs. You could maybe introduce new HTML version in a year in the 90s, but now you&#x27;re stuck with HTML 4 for decades because literally millions of applications depend on it and they are not going to change, and HTML 5 is rolling out in baby steps, despite all the cool stuff it proposes. Looks what happens to XP - they have a massive install base and now Microsoft can not get rid of it, however hard it tries. Market size is enormous now, and so the pace of adoption of any paradigm-shifting concepts is much slower than before.<p>>>> we have less IT/programming jobs today than we had in the late 1990s.<p>Could you back this up with some data? I haven&#x27;t found the data that support this conclusion. The programming jobs are shifting around and moving, but I don&#x27;t see IT being smaller now that it is in the 90s, even accounting for the dotcom bust.

People who have the ability to assess that talent (which is different from the talent itself, also uncommon) are rare, people who have the money or organizational position necessary to pay significant numbers of programmer salaries are rare, and the intersection of those two sets, even in a world with almost 7 billion people, is vanishingly small.<p>The talent is rarer than the capital, and the capital often isn&#x27;t owned by the decision-makers (VC) but the people who control the capital are the ones who get more arrogant. Why? Because capital is easy to demonstrate, and talent is hard to prove. It&#x27;s especially hard to prove talent without breaking social protocol, which is the real advantage of pedigree. Everyone knows that there are plenty of sharp people without pedigree, but proving you&#x27;re one of them requires being extremely assertive. Professionally, it&#x27;s often better to be presumed intelligent and thereby be able to optimize for social polish alone.",1399163421

When Intel thinks they are ahead, compute doesn&#x27;t get cheaper.<p>In the DDR2 days, If you were on Intel, you had the choice between the stunningly inefficient and expensive rambus ram, or a stunningly shitty memory buss with (not very many) low-power ddr2 modules.<p>At the time, the AMD HyperTransport system was absolutely beautiful.  Even on cheap boards, you could get more than 2x the low-power ddr2 ram modules per CPU that intel could.  (at the time, lower-density modules were dramatically cheaper, per gigabyte, than higher-density modules)     It worked way better when you had multiple CPUs, too.<p>Then ddr3 came, and Intel came up with their QPI systems, which were awesome.  AMD came back with a competently built ddr3 platform, too;  the G34 systems were a huge upgrade from the mcp55 chipset socket F platform.<p>But the benchmarks came out in Intel&#x27;s favor, even when AMD had twice the cores.     I mean, you could argue that the AMD systems had advantages in some limited situations, but they had lost the dramatic advantage.<p>As far as I can tell, intel has been largely resting on their laurels, price-wise.   The E5-2620 is better than, but really not radically better than the E5520.  Now, some of the higher-end E5s are pretty nice, but they are priced accordingly.<p>Until Intel gets some real competition again, we have to pay for our performance gains.<p>So yeah, really, until AMD gets their legs back under them, and I hope the A1100[1] will do it, I don&#x27;t expect dramatic performance per dollar gains from Intel.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.amd.com/en-us/press-releases/Pages/amd-to-accelerate-2014jan28.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amd.com/en-us/press-releases/Pages/amd-to-acceler...</a>",1399163159

That you end with a discussion of money and survivability of the FPS somewhat drives the point home of how different our views are: an open system doesn&#x27;t necessarily attract commercial value, it attracts eccentric purposes. AirQuake wasn&#x27;t made for money, it was made because someone wanted to take something known and explore. Conversely, CoD and MW might be fighting for life because it&#x27;s only the same commercial hacks doing the same thing to death and not letting other people come in and muck around with shitty barely working mods. Not that people necessarily still do wide-scale show up and start building mutators, anymore: most would rather get paid by the hacks to do &quot;blockbusters.&quot;<p>As per Gibson: &quot;The street find&#x27;s it own uses for things,&quot; and it&#x27;s that ability of the street to do so that gives long renewing interest into the thing.

Where a large chunk of the reason behind why nuclear power is not more widely used is public (panicked) response to radiation concerns. Even though burning coal ends up with a larger radiation dose per MWH. Even though the alternative tends to be coal or oil fired power plants. Even though nuclear power (with suitable reprocessing) is the cleanest general-purpose form of power generation we have. (And yes, this includes &quot;green&quot; energy.
