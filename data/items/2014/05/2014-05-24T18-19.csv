He runs his own private practice. When he opened the clinic in the early 90s, he quickly realized that keeping track of patient records in paper format was not efficient. So he taught himself Microsoft Access (which came out in 1992!) and wrote his own patient record management software, which greatly increased his productivity and therefore income/leisure time.<p>Fast-forward to 2011. I was organizing an international conference and needed to send out some email blasts. The problem was, all the email addresses I needed were on a several hundred page PDF document with no clear format. So I had a choice: I could spend days manually copy-pasting and cleaning stuff up, or I could try to automate it. I ended up writing a Ruby script that grabbed the embedded text and pattern-matched email addresses and spat them out onto a text file. Still not perfect (my regex was rudimentary) but it got the job done a lot faster. Learning basic Ruby took me several hours, and I ran into some (silly) issues [1], but that&#x27;s still better than the several days I would have spent doing the task manually.<p>You may be thinking, &quot;well, we have specialists for that sort of thing today.&quot; Sure. But just like there are many rural areas in the US where it doesn&#x27;t make economic sense for ISPs to lay out fiber, there are many personal tasks and errands where it doesn&#x27;t make sense for professional developers to write software for. So there is a lot to be said for the need for individual empowerment through programming.<p>[1]<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6566884/rubys-file-open-gives-no-such-file-or-directory-text-txt-errnoenoent-er"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6566884/rubys-file-open-g...</a>",1400957032

7793963,comment,7793469,7793597,3,0,CHY872,,,"Ugh, the other replies aren&#x27;t quite getting at the crux of the matter. A function f : {0, 1}^k -> {0, 1}^n -> {0, 1}^m is considered to be pseudo-random if (when provided with a key K) there is no way of distinguishing between its output and the output of a random  function F : {0, 1}^n -> {0, 1}^m in polynomial time (it&#x27;s a little more complicated than that, but that&#x27;s the gist).<p>In modern computers, the basic principle is that one generates a random seed (through heat noise, keyboard movements, mouse movements, user interactions with the computer etc) and then uses it as the key for a pseudo-random function such that the next output of the function cannot be predicted given all of the previous. One can simply iterate if one so chose (first n bits output = f_K(0), next f_K(1), ...).<p>In this case, he&#x27;s simply worked by the fact that if one knows that their target is using this key scheme, one knows that at most there are 50^4 passwords the target could be using. If there are 90 bits of entropy, that means that there are 2^90 passwords that the target could be using. What seems to be the difference here is that this program outputs a special character between each word, or a 2-digit number, meaning that we have 50000^4*(100+32)^4 > 2^90. It&#x27;s kinda messy, and probably not that easy to remember.<p>In general, with passwords, one wants about 2^80 bits of entropy - it&#x27;s high enough to be incredibly difficult to crack even when hashed insecurely. Once we start using proper algorithms like bcrypt it&#x27;s even harder.<p>To give a comparison, a password output by this is roughly as hard to crack as a 15 character random password encoded in ASCII, or if unicode is allowed, a 6 character password in that encoding.",1400955978

7793921,comment,7793594,7793796,5,0,j2kun,,,"I support you in full for taking a critical mind to the topic. But I take issue; I think your perspective is overly narrow.<p>You say<p>> We’re teaching programming, network infrastructure, databases, communication protocols, markup. We’re teaching these things because these technologies are so ubiquitous and important, that it will benefit everyone to have a little understanding of them.<p>I don&#x27;t know what your computer science education was, but the fundamental idea in mine was &quot;learning how to take an idea in your head and turn it into a program.&quot; The principles were not networks, databases, and protocols, but rather modularization, reuse, clarity, and algorithm analysis. You think refining these tools is not important?<p>You give an example:<p>> If I was to shuffle a pack of fifty-two playing cards and hand them to you, then asked you to sort them, you’d do what any sensible person on the planet would do. You’d sort them into suit order first, then into value order.<p>The point of computational thinking is that you can concretely analyze <i>how good</i> this method is and compare it with others (I&#x27;m sure you know the tradeoffs involved in sorting!). Of course everyone knows how to naturally decompose things, but reasoning about it and handling adversarial cases, that&#x27;s where computational thinking comes in.<p>Computational thinking (forget the Popular Title, just the idea of applying computational ideas elsewhere in life) is <i>extremely valuable</i>, and I&#x27;ll give you two prominent examples: the first in the design of fair markets, which has revolutionized more than one industry [1], and the design of new computers, such as quantum computers and DNA computing [2]. I can continue: computational thinking is applied in designing fun games (not just in programming them!), art and product design, literally every optimization problem in every industry, cognitive psychology, the study of evolution, political analysis, information and security, and so on. I can give you references and examples if you want.<p>You would rather call Computer Science &quot;what it is&quot; and omit these opportunities for people who don&#x27;t want to be software engineers their entire life? It sounds more like you&#x27;re in a bubble where the only thing to aspire to is Steve Wozniak and browser design and &quot;realistic flag fluttering&quot; in games. The truth is that computational systems are everywhere in life, and being able to recognize, formalize, and analyze them are what makes computational thinking useful. It&#x27;s not just about writing programs.<p>Maybe your point is that we should separate the two fields: instead of one big Computer Science degree we should have Software Engineering which is just about programming and Theoretical Computer Science which is just about the mathematics and Applied Computer Science which is about the other stuff. I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to that, but your argument rather suggests we throw everything out but protocols and databases, and if someone told me I were going to get that and only that from a computer science education, I&#x27;d have run far far away.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2014/04/02/stable-marriages-and-designing-markets/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2014/04/02/stable-marriages-and-designi...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_computing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_computing</a>",1400954765
