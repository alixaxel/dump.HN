Or will violate, whenever the rate of dropped packets goes above a given threshold. I view the hard fail as just speeding up the interconnect failure, with the positive effect of prompting action from the last mile ISP.<p>Whenever their performance drops towards part of the internet, their value proposition gets lower. You can view the value chain as<p><pre><code>  (residential customer) <-> Comcast <-> Level 3 <-> (hosting customer)\n</code></pre>\nBoth Comcast and Level 3 have customers, in opposite ends of the currently centralized internet. The status quo is that each provider charges to the customers on their end. Comcast (and each of the other non-net-neutral ISPs) are eyeing the revenue stream on the other end of the pipeline. This revenue stream has historically not been owned by the last-mile ISP.<p>Level 3 and equivalents, by cutting off non-performant interconnects will hurt their own customers, of course. However, they are just speeding up the same effect being applied softly over time, by Comcast and equivalents. A softly failing interconnect moves revenue over to last mile ISPs, thus permanently lowering Level 3&#x27;s value proposition. By failing the interconnect sharply, instead of softly, they actually improve the steady state of the system, in general (good side effect), and in particular (the real objective).",1399388371

When the speedrunner wants to race against his/herself, the speedrunner can start a split program with their previous record and play the game through. When a key point is reached, they press some button to denote that they reached this check point and the program will mark the time it took to reach it and tell you whether you are ahead or behind the previous record.

I had a little bit of a double-whammy; I moved from Northern California to San Diego and started working from home at the same time. I simultaneously lost most of my social circle and surrounded myself in a bubble of work. I was working for a company, so I at least had my coworkers on Skype most of the day, but really, my only sources of face-to-face interaction with people were my wife and the dog park in my apartment complex.<p>Between the isolation and the stresses associated with the job, I wound up moving back up to the bay area. I work in an office now, and essentially only see coworkers in the flesh for a few minutes each day, but I still feel so much less isolated.<p>All of that said, I am pretty sure that I want to be working from home again in the future; I&#x27;m just going to come up with some better coping techniques for it.",1399387613

This move by Russians is a retaliation for that.<p>> The new Russian owned payment system is dead in the water from a non-Russian perspective, the only reason VISA and MC are so popular in Russia is because people do not trust local alternatives, not because they don&#x27;t have other options.<p>The reason why VISA and MC are so popular is because there is nothing else.

Their definition of firm is a business that has paid employees and not all contingent workers count under that definition because they are often independent contractors or employees of a third party agency.  The broader availability of all kinds of services from legal to insurance to accounting to technology to logistics to HR/staffing also allows 1-person businesses to handle more than they ever have, while potential legal and regulatory concerns have raised the cost of hiring the first employee.

To add to the points from the article, here are a few things I&#x27;ve learned over the years:<p>- Your office chair is the most important piece of equipment in your office. You&#x27;re in contact with it most of the day. Buy a good one and it will last you for years. Buy a bad one and it will give you back problems for years.<p>- If you can, join a CrossFit (or similar) gym. Not only will you get in great shape, they become a social outlet and because they&#x27;re time boxed, you&#x27;re in and out in an hour.<p>- Whether you like it or not, your spouse/significant other&#x27;s days off become your days off so plan accordingly.<p>- Enjoy the flexibility of working from home. While you don&#x27;t want to plunk down and watch TV when you should be working, you can do things like meet a plumber at your house without taking time off.<p>- Build in a hard stop at the end of your day so you don&#x27;t blur lines between the workday and personal time. For me, I have a rule that I never work while the kids are home and awake. My wife texts me when they&#x27;re leaving daycare and that gives me about 15 minutes to save what I&#x27;m working on and shift from work mode to home mode.<p>We&#x27;re moving from Seattle to the Tokyo suburbs next month.

Also a single setting being reset during update, is not a case you easily notice during testing. So it is no surprise that a bug like that made it into the release at some point.<p>Beside that there are several cases where browser profiles can be corrupted. That includes browser crashes, bugs in the browser itself, unreliable storage devices and a few other cases. You will realize that users of every extension that can be configured, occasionally report that their settings had been reset. Of course that don&#x27;t bothers you if you use the default settings anyway. But also there is not much extension developers can do against that.",1399387217

Amazon sells only the Kindle edition, which is copy-protected.<p>To take an example I&#x27;m familiar with, <i>Programming Android</i> in e-book form in a choice of DRM-free formats is $18.99 at oreilly.com, on sale. Purchasing (sort of, Amazon can revoke your purchase) at Amazon.com costs $19.79.<p>But, and there&#x27;s always a big &quot;but,&quot; you can rent <i>Programming Android</i> in Kindle form for $8.96, which is a great deal for a programming book you may not need to keep around after you read it. You can even rent it twice if you are slow getting through it and it would be cheaper than buying the Kindle edition from Amazon.<p>Some people find reading code in e-books difficult. All the code in <i>Programming Android</i> is available for download, which you can read in Eclipse or Android Studio, with cross referencing and doc pop-ups and syntax coloring. E-books do have an advantage in that O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;animal&quot; series is all monochrome printing in hard copy, but the e-books have syntax coloring and color diagrams.",1399386602

I can share our intentions with that API call in the long run, and how it&#x27;ll end up smaller, which is especially important for mobile devices.<p>The dictionary describing the user you requested comes back with some high level sub-dictionaries in it: &quot;profile&quot;, &quot;basics&quot;, &quot;public keys&quot;, &quot;pictures&quot;, etc., and the API replies, currently, with <i>all</i> the data to which you&#x27;re entitled. This is quite huge as Tim mentioned in his post.<p>Server-side we have a module for loading user information, which allows you to request which of these fields you want when loading a &quot;user object&quot;. For example, on a certain page of the site we might load a dozen users but only need [user.BASICS, user.PICTURES], so that&#x27;s the only data that will be loaded.<p>The API simply doesn&#x27;t expose this filtering mechanism, yet, as calls the API hit [user.ALL] which is a combo of everything available about a user. So, in essence, all we need to do to trim these down is allow you to pass a filtering parameter.<p>Btw, going in the other direction, there&#x27;ll be a way to query for multiple users at once, fattening things back up :-).

In fact this whole thread is full of examples of other idiosyncratic methods of traversing (JSON only) data types.<p>Except lenses aren&#x27;t. Lenses are <i>highly principled</i> and compose and combine in ridiculous ways while maintaining their exact behavior. Half the features proposed in this thread exist naturally and &quot;emergently&quot; by the nature of lenses. Finally, they follow mathematical laws describing how everything should work together all to the T.<p>At the highest level a Lens is a getter plus a setter bound together. You can extract either component to get or set a subpart of a value.<p>At the next level, you can take note that lenses &quot;compose&quot; (as a category) by letting you reach deeper and deeper into a structure. This is what I took advantage of with the JSON example above: composing them with `(.)`.<p>At the next level, lenses generalize naturally to &quot;traversals&quot; which target multiple subparts all at once and &quot;folds&quot; which build exotic &quot;getters&quot; over multiple targeted subparts.<p>At the next level, lenses &quot;dualize&quot; to prisms which deal with branching types. This is hard to explain if you haven&#x27;t used a language with a true sum type (Scala, Haskell, ML, and lets not get into lazy/strict sums) but I used one above to traverse into the &quot;Object&quot; indicating failure if my assumption of the structure of the JSON blob were wrong.<p>At the next level you generalize these into isomorphisms which have nice mathematical properties determining when two types are identical by giving you invertible mappings between the two. This is like a lens which focuses on the entire type as its &quot;subpart&quot;.<p>(<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens</a>)<p>---<p>At the end of the day there are even more steps in that hierarchy. It sounds ridiculously complex, and it is a little bit to learn. The advantage is, however, that the intuition of &quot;focusing on a subpart&quot; applies over any data type and with pretty near any weird combination of &quot;lens-like&quot; operators you can dream up.<p>---<p>Usually when someone first hears about lenses they say &quot;Oh, getters and setters. I have those already, no big deal&quot;. That&#x27;s really far from the case, however... Lenses end up being the XPath of <i>everything</i>.",1399385297

7704471,comment,7702500,7704299,4,0,adwf,,,"That&#x27;s the exact reason that most pop music is marketed at teenagers.  For them, it&#x27;s the first time they&#x27;ve heard it (relatively speaking).  As you get older, you&#x27;ve heard all the 4/4 C-major stuff you can stand.  Even if you&#x27;re not particularly musical, you will still subconciously recognise that pop songs are repetitive and fairly unoriginal after a while.  But it&#x27;s an easy sale for the record labels, so that why they do it.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean that there doesn&#x27;t occasionally come along a good song or two.  It&#x27;s still perfectly possible to write a 4/4 song in C and have it be interesting/fun/good to listen to.  Unfortunately you&#x27;ll have to wade through a whole load of crap in the pop charts before you find it ;)",1399384878

Sure you&#x27;ll maybe send data people don&#x27;t want this time, but it will probably save processing and networking overhead that would be spent building and sending a long list of the fields they want.  When designing an API I tend to lean to being a bit more verbose than I need to be, if only to save the HTTP overhead of another request.  At least until HTTP2 helps us out there.",1399384845
