Click on &quot;introductory&quot; and you see an article written using less jargon and more high level overview information. Click on &quot;academic&quot; and you see an article written for someone at a sophomore level in college. Some math, some jargon, but without an expectation of prior domain expertise. Click on &quot;expert&quot; and you see an article with domain specific jargon, appropriate as a reference for someone who already has a great deal of experience with the subject matter.<p>It seems to me like that kind of end goal would also provide a better balance between editorial choice on how much detail is appropriate and providing a smorgasbord of information that potentially overwhelms the audience.",1401037197

7796793,comment,7794227,7794227,1,0,kimcheeme,,,"+ Depends on how many kids you ideally want.\n+ Depends on where you WANT to live when you have kids \n+ Depends on what your profession is (e.g. full-stack developer or business guy with niche skillset)\n+ What&#x27;s a reasonable amount of risk to you?<p>If you are a developer who can just go get another 100k job wherever then you can take a decent amount of risk (even running your own startup and failing).<p>If you live in a city like SF or NY and want 2-3 kids, that money can go VERY fast if you haven&#x27;t planned well (should be looking into tax-free contribution trusts for the kids though.)<p>There&#x27;s couple of things you can do:\n1) Invest in assets (real estate, stocks, startups, muni bonds)\n2) Invest in yourself (additional schooling or education)\n3) Take a gamble and be an entrepreneur\n4) Do NOTHING and keep your powder dry\n5) Do a combination of the above<p>Interestingly enough, I think under the right scenario, you can learn to invest across assets & start a startup.<p>I do not recommend investing in startups until you&#x27;ve gone through a startup and fully realize how hard it is to succeed what kind of &quot;real risks&quot; you are taking investing in these companies. Plus, seed investing (what you will be doing) needs enough sample size - most likely min 20k @ 20+ investments and each having a chance to all go to 0 (very high chance; that&#x27;s why a lot of crappy incubators flop).<p>Investing in stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. --> this can take thousands of hours to do well but you have to start somewhere in your life. B-school won&#x27;t help you, getting a CFA won&#x27;t help you, investing in these assets also means understanding the style of investing you&#x27;re comfortable with. It&#x27;s also a lot harder than people think it is at this point of the economic cycle (its was easy to make money when we were at the bottom of the market and fed juiced the markets up)... it&#x27;s much harder to get good returns around this year to next year.  However this also means you may want to play with tranches of 50k and give yourself 3ins to fk up completely. spending 150k total max loss out of 500k to put yourself into a position to force yourself to learn to invest is, in my opinion, a pretty cool position to be in, given that you still have a lot of dry powder left. That allows you to experiment with etfs, individual stocks options, futures, even day trading --> all of which even if you lose 150k over the next 2 years, it will help you see how that side of the world works for the rest of your life. And if it&#x27;s the case that you&#x27;re going to be fairly well off one way or another (upper-middle class lifestyle in your 40s), you&#x27;re going to have to learn how to invest anyway.\nReal estate investing in these times is something I would stay away from (if you&#x27;re going to do it, I would spend money on getting some education on real estate and wait for things to pop in a few years or only buy extremely selective assets - just remember that being a landlord is a lot more painful than people realize in the beginning).<p>Becoming an entrepreneur - You&#x27;re in a lucky position to self-fund the seed amount and especially if you&#x27;re a developer then that seed amount can go a long ways. If not, you still have the financial wherewithdal to pay for a top developer for about a year. Even then though I would put a cap on it for $250k of your own money ($100k in developer expense for a year, $100k marketing expense, and $50k in living expense. Based on my experience, if you can&#x27;t get enough &quot;smart&quot; money funding after you&#x27;ve spent $250k, that&#x27;s probably not going to be a good idea b/c what you realize is that there&#x27;s actually a lot of dumb &quot;smart&quot; money that just has to put capital to work.<p>All in all, I would focus on your passion (what interests you the most) and stick to one thing as the primary way to improve your financial stability and as a little hobby on the side, dabble in one more thing that you&#x27;d like to do better.  (e.g. Do a startup and on the side invest a $50k allocation by following stocks in your startups&#x27; space).<p>One thing I highly recommend you to think about as a possibility is to spend 50k (10%) and travel around the world for 3 months with your wife. That can help in almost everything that you possibly want to do (even raising a family) : )<p>You&#x27;ll have enough time to read about a number of things you want to potentially experiment with while seeing how the world is actually working and what each place needs; meet some cool people along the way and see how those people are thinking about the world. Plus, a decent amount of time to relax with your wife and have many a nights&#x27;conversations as to what you guys think is the right next step to take (under a stress free environment). Also, if you&#x27;re going down the startup path - you&#x27;re probably not going to take any time off your first 24 months and it&#x27;ll most likely be the most stressful thing you&#x27;ve ever done...<p>My background:\nI positioned my life to be single, no mortgage, work my ass off to save couple hundred thousand bucks saved by 27. Would like to think of myself as having domain expertise in finanical markets. For the past few years, continued to invest in public markets, decided that B-school was not worth it for me (have tons of friends who went to top b-school), worked & failed in my startup with my best friend, and wasted $150k of my savings. The best thing for my career was failing at my startup - I learned more than any of my friends who spent the same amount of money going to a top bschool. Better yet, I realized that even after I failed, that is the space I want to be in and that I&#x27;m actually pretty good at it (just didn&#x27;t have the right business concept).  Now I&#x27;m working with another startup.  Prior to startups, I&#x27;ve traveled to over 30 countries over 6 month period and read every periodical / book / website on business, investing, startups, etc. Absolutely one of the best/coolest things I&#x27;ve ever done that provides dividends time and time again.<p>Can have a more personal chat if you think that I can help.",1401037128

7796766,comment,7796222,7796680,6,0,wpietri,,,"Hosting cost is the very least of the concerns.<p>One important one is impact. Most people treat Wikipedia content as &quot;probably true&quot;, so any time where the truth of something matters, zero content is better than bad content. That&#x27;s true for all sorts of scientific, medical, and commercial content.<p>Another is impact on living people. The folks who wrangle the rules for biographies of people still alive [1] have put a lot of thought into recognizing the impact that Wikipedia articles can have on people. Having nothing is often better than having a bad article.<p>A third is self-promotion and vanity. People are willing to write endlessly about themselves. Bands formed by teens in their garages, companies trying to promote themselves, blatant spam, subtle commercial manipulation: Wikipedia doesn&#x27;t need that.<p>A fourth is maintainability. The number of active Wikipedia editors is modest. Some sorts of content attract new editors. But quite a lot won&#x27;t. I think it&#x27;s often better for Wikipedia to have no article than a bad article that isn&#x27;t going to get better soon.<p>And that points toward a fifth thing: the value of the Wikipedia brand. Wikipedia won the reference race because of its quality. It is enormously valuable for the world to have a single, high-quality factual resource. The brand should be maintained. People can (and certainly do) disagree on where to draw the line between crap and not-crap. But almost nobody disagrees that there is quite a lot of non-encyclopedic material (e.g., [2], [3]), and that the Internet is plenty big enough to host that somewhere other than Wikipedia.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_deletion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Criteria_for_speedy_d...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not</a>",1401036727

There are a few biologists and of course cognitive psychologist, medical doctors or people from the department of neuroinformatics.<p>1a) Get an (paid) internship at a local research department. It&#x27;s easy to get in (at least in my experience), even if you&#x27;re not working on computational models in the first place. Most of these departments are not run very tightly, and there are lots of opportunities to do what you are best suited for. Though i would recommend to get back into university for a bachelors degree.<p>1b) Apply for google summer of code or something equivalent. There are lots of open internships for the summer which are directly involved with the human brain project.<p>2) It&#x27;s about dynamic systems. So you have to ainte up your math. If you know your way around statistics, 2d/3d simulations, data structures and algorithms it&#x27;s a huge plus. I recommend spending some time on top coder for the latter two. So you already have the advantage of knowing most of the common ML concepts.<p>3) Read everything you get your hands on which is connected to neuroscience. You have to get the full picture. Psychology, cognitive neuroscience, biophysics, medicine, neuroinformatics, etc. pp. First basics to get an overview, then concentrate on recent papers.<p>4) Improve your writing and presenting, if you have difficulties with either one. It will be an essential part of your work to discuss and present results.<p>5) Don&#x27;t trap yourself into thinking you&#x27;re not smart enough. Results in research need ambition, duration and vision more then being the smartest person in the room every day.<p>Most of the software which is written in science is just prototype grade to prove a point and get a paper accepted in a journal. Standards are low, so bringing something different (systems engineering, source control management, automation, hpc programming, testing, deep knowledge of a framework/programming language etc. pp) is also considered a plus. So whenever you think something could be improved you should speak up and have a detailed explanation at hand why this would be an improvement. Communication is key sometimes, remember most of the people you will be working with are not computer scientists nor did they ever work in an industry environment.<p>It&#x27;s a good thing to have a deep understanding of at least one of the following commonly used frameworks/programming languages in (neuro)science plus TeX (not a complete list, just the top of my head). Though you&#x27;ll probably end up learning or writing a new/established framework depending on the field of research you will be doing.<p>c/cpp, Python, Matlab/Octave, (statistics) R/Julia, (hpc/gpu) OpenCL/Cuda, (functional) Lisp/Haskell<p>I would recommend Python (Scipy/Numpy) if you&#x27;re used to Javascript front end development (OOP/dynamic).\nAlso i would advice you to get acquainted with your favorite unix shell and the core utils if you aren&#x27;t already. (Plus getting to know at least one tool for plotting any kind of data)<p>Teams are rather small, depending on the budget. So in academia it&#x27;s usually one or two group leaders with a professors degree, a handful postdocs and couple more phd students plus student assistants. Departments funded by industry are requiring a phd in my experience. Which does not mean you can&#x27;t work there without having one, but you&#x27;re less likely doing actual research. \nYou will not exclusively doing one thing only, it&#x27;s a rather versatile field.<p>I hope you&#x27;ll make the shift into neuroscience.\nI think it&#x27;s the last great mystery on earth which is to be explored.\nFor me it&#x27;s been a life changing experience and it still keeps on giving.<p>Best of luck.",1401036665

7796753,comment,7795621,7795756,17,0,_flag,,,"Summary of the paper for those who don&#x27;t want to read it:<p>So basically there are two categories of &quot;learning&quot; involved in this sort of research, supervised and unsupervised. In supervised learning, someone gives the computer a long list of concepts and their attributes (&quot;frog&quot;, &quot;green frog&quot;, &quot;jumping frog&quot;) and a set of pictures to go with each item, and feeds them into a visual-recognition algorithm. In unsupervised learning, the computer is given a concept like &quot;frog&quot; but then has to discover all the variations itself and get its own visual data to match.<p>The claim in this paper is that they have made the unsupervised learning as strong as the supervised learning. That is, they give the computer a concept (&quot;frog&quot;), it goes and searches through Google Books for common variations (&quot;green frog&quot;, &quot;jumping frog&quot;) and then uses Google image search to fetch images for each of those queries. They can then remove the obvious false positives (they test to see which images seem to screw up their learning algorithm and leave those out), and the result they get is on par with the supervised learning methods.<p>----------------------<p>In my opinion, this is only mildly interesting because Google Image Search functions based on human input anyway -- Google knows the difference between a &quot;frog&quot; and a &quot;jumping frog&quot; or even a &quot;camel&quot; simply because people on the internet caption such images and Google can make associations between images and their captions. Essentially, what the researchers have managed to do is outsource the work of some grad student to millions of people around the world through Google.<p>Of course, it could be argued that there is some sort of parallel with what humans actually do (we know what things are called because we hear other people call them that), but even if I didn&#x27;t know the name of an animal I could still tell you when the same animal is in different pictures, and I can also tell you when it&#x27;s jumping and what colour it is. I don&#x27;t need to have someone caption the image for me to understand the broad range of situations to which the caption &quot;jump&quot; applies.",1401036574

They&#x27;re rigid and not really orthogonal to any other API, so they&#x27;re difficult to combine with existing or new APIs. They can&#x27;t ever really change behavior either, because people are going to rely on specific implementation details. If you&#x27;re a game, you might be able to use them (assuming you don&#x27;t want to do anything out of the norm), and you can&#x27;t if you aren&#x27;t. Problem is, the platform isn&#x27;t just a gaming platform, it&#x27;s a platform for pretty much everything, and the platform developer probably isn&#x27;t a game developer either. This means he or she probably doesn&#x27;t have the expertise to write the exact APIs game developers want, that will be flexible in just the right ways, etc, and whatever API they did write would only be for a subset of the platforms &quot;customers&quot;.<p>The real problem here is that the APIs that do exist sound like they are poorly documented and not necessarily thought-out with respect to the rest of the system. Ideally, all of the options needed for a full screen game should be well-documented and orthogonal, so they can be combined to achieve what each of the various apps wants without having to write a &quot;BeginFullScreen$APPTYPE&quot; function. Then, if there truly is a common setup games want, it can be built as a separate library on top of these APIs, either by the platform maker or by a 3rd party.<p>> They might try to hire and cultivate good API designers, and have real, talented developers who do nothing but work on the APIs to the internal systems.<p>There <i>are</i> teams at these companies that do this. This is exactly what the Android Frameworks team does at Google, which includes people like Dianne Hackborn and Romain Guy (until a few months ago), to name a couple of the better known members. They&#x27;re in charge of designing and implementing a lot of APIs exposed to third party developers, but also spend time each release reviewing all of the APIs that are being made public.",1401036412

Things like gorilla&#x27;s CookieStore/Upgrader or application-specific structs like a hub, database connection, or websocket pool could conceivably be singleton package-level vars, and in practice it seems like a lot of small-sized servers implement raw http.Handlers and just stick to using package vars.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to start a Singleton debate but I like to avoid using them where possible, so I always wind up writing http.Handler factories moreso than raw handlers. This comment may be a bit outside of this blog post but I am curious if package-level vars and raw Handlers are more idiomatic in Go than using factories to produce handlers and prevent package-level vars.<p>Edit:<p>Calls in the original post that made me think of this are calls such as:<p><pre><code>  user.FindUser(usr.Email)\n\n  cookies.LoginCookie(usr.Email)\n</code></pre>\n...which may very well be package functions instead of struct member functions.",1401034840

Actually, Nortel was already hitting firms up for licensing those patents before they went down. It was already &quot;wound up and pointed in the right direction.&quot; Everyone knew what was coming. The companies that bought them did so to manage their own risk. They are now simply going after the rest of the industry that failed to do so.<p>2. Rockstar is now suing giant corporations like Google and Samsung. You think they wouldn&#x27;t get the FTC and DoJ involved if they could prove anything?<p><i>>Compared to cost of trial and appeals ...</i><p>Those are the only concrete costs. Everything else is handwavy (public opinion? Really? Impact on stock? The <i>weather</i> has more impact) or highly unlikely (injunctions).  The companies IV goes after can certainly afford to take them on.<p><i>> pro-plaintiff Federal Circuit judges</i><p>I&#x27;d encourage you to lay off Timothy Lee&#x27;s articles about the Federal Circuit and actually look up statistics about their decisions.<p><i>> Of course there isn&#x27;t.

Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but it&#x27;s not proof that evidence is being suppressed either. claiming something is a problem without sufficient evidence is not a very strong evidence either.<p>2. Evidence always leaks out. All those other trolls no doubt have NDAs, yet we hear of them. If so many startups are getting hit, where were the VCs in this whole thing?<p>Nonetheless, there&#x27;s something in the works about making these &quot;nastygrams&quot; more trackable. That will give us enough data to see how much of a problem this really is. Until then all we have is a outrage driven by a media hungry for rageviews and informed by PR.",1401033983

7796629,comment,7795035,7796530,1,0,j2kun,,,"GA has nothing to do with evolution? Now I am thoroughly confused. GA is inspired by natural selection. If you program your algorithm to mimic natural selection then of course it&#x27;s related to evolution, and if you don&#x27;t then it&#x27;s no longer a GA. Maybe your point is that the GA community has taken their snake oil so far away from this that they&#x27;re not even using natural selection anymore?<p>If you want to study GAs, and you want to avoid the snake oil, what would you do? Selling it as studying the mathematics of natural selection seems like a good idea to me. I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s  Papadimitriou&#x27;s motivation, but he does mention things like GAs in his talks.<p>The DBLP page has a handful of papers at the very beginning relating to this new direction. I didn&#x27;t want to presume to choose one, so I linked there. But for those who don&#x27;t have the time to read the titles and abstracts, here is one titled &quot;Multiplicative updates in coordination games and the theory of evolution.&quot; [1]<p>Here is an excerpt:<p>> In this paper we provide such a demonstration; in doing so, we make some totally unexpected connections between Evolution and familiar concepts from Computation and Game Theory.<p>They go on to show that the natural selection occurring in some well accepted model of natural selection is equivalent to a multiplicative weight update in a coordination game. This would suggest that if we want to come up with provable guarantees for the convergence properties of GAs, we may fare better by relating their dynamics to these well-understood tools.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3160"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3160</a>",1401033922

Noticing that you often change the same files together is an indication of coupling that might be bad. You can also weight the code metric higher for files that change frequently and recently, because if it&#x27;s an old file, or one that doesnt change much, the quality is probably good enough,",1401033894
