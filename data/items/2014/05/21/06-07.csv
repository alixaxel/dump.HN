That second child has already resulted into two offspring, and counts for twice as much.<p>Well, to pull the idea from my own other comment... a child+grandchild pair is not twice as good as a child even if all you care about is that specific moment in time). It&#x27;s 1.5 times as good, because a grandchild is only half as good as a child.<p>And (as ars says) once all concerned have died, the timing offset is of no significance whatever. However, for the impact on <i>your</i> total representation in the world of the present (no particular present), which does have significance... see my other comment, where you&#x27;re still quite wrong. The Euler-Lotka equation values all members of the population equally; that has no relationship to reality when you&#x27;re talking about (in your own exact words) &quot;how many copies your genes make of themselves&quot;.",1400655181

I think startup enthusiasts on the other hand are kind of like starting a band, providing entertainment/art for an audience and for the performer to satisfy an itch. Life is a finite thing which makes our chosen paths speak for our individual/subjective values.

This means you have to sample the origin and destination of the IP packets and make some calculations to know how many miles the packet has traveled and pay / get paid if someone dumps long haul traffic to a peer.
