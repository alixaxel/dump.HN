7776877,comment,7776481,7776529,3,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"My personal opinion on this issue is that we already have a pretty good sense of public/private spaces in the physical world. The problem is that most people assume that if your computer is in a private space (ie your bedroom) then it is also private. This is obviously not the case.<p>What we need is to start building a culture of online privacy. Everyone should have access to an anonymizing VPN, should know how to use Tor and understand PGP. But just like it would be insane to never leave your bedroom and unlock your door, or always speak in a whisper, the same applies to online privacy.<p>And the important thing is just because you are in your private space doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re doing anything wrong or shameful. People use private spaces to snort lines of coke and plan bank robberies, but also just to have some time when they can think and not be bothered... or watched. People need to start using Tor just to browse the web and know they aren&#x27;t being watched, that neither the government nor advertisers are building a profile on you.<p>And just like physical privacy means less social, so does online. Online privacy should be about keeping anonymous. Don&#x27;t talk about where you live, what your hobbies are etc. Be conscious of not leaving a trail of personally identifiable information (just like you close the blinds in your bedroom).<p>It&#x27;s not a question of always watched or always hidden, but being conscious of when we are being watched, and when we are free to say and do as we please.",1400651397

I hate trackpads.<p>• Three-button mouse.<p>• Choice of window manager, for:<p>• Focus-follows mouse.<p>• Mappable window manager hotkeys.  I&#x27;ve got a set of features I&#x27;ve programmed into my window manager over the past 17 years (ironically:  based on Aqua&#x27;s antecedant, WindowMaker).  They fit my workflow.  Among them:  alt-shift-t pops up a terminal window, alt-shift maximizes a window vertically (what the keybindings are matters far less than <i>that I can map these functions</i>.  Resizing windows on OS X is a goddamned fucking mouse-up-your-ass-but-only-the-lower-right-corner pain.  Every. Fucking. Time.<p>• Pinnable window menus.  For when I need to track down a specific window (xlsclients | wc -l => 118 -- no, Expose doesn&#x27;t cut it).<p>• An integrated package system with an unparalleled set of packages:  grep -h &#x27;^Package:&#x27;  <i>_Packages | sort -u | wc -l => 50493.  Yes, 50,493 packages.  OS X has fink, and darwinports, and a mash of other tools, but fails to deliver a single integrated package management system, and the offerings I&#x27;ve found are sparse and tend to be poorly supported.<p>• Customizeability, in general.  Not tweaking for its own sake, but simply getting things to work how I want them to.<p>• /proc and /sys.  Believe it or not, having filesystem-based access to system internals is seriously fucking amazing.<p>• No &quot;undocumented&quot; features.  Which isn&#x27;t to say that there are system features which lack documentation, but there are not features </i>for which documentation is being intentionally withheld*, as is the case for Macs.<p>• My hardware won&#x27;t age out while it&#x27;s still remotely usable.  I&#x27;ve got 22 year old systems I can still boot and update.

Though honestly for desktop rollouts of the past 5-10 years, it&#x27;s a very close race.<p>• There&#x27;s often a use of Mac-specific applications.  OS lock-in through application space is OS lock-in.  It worked for Microsoft for a quarter century.<p>• It&#x27;s often good enough.  Not perfect, but Apple does very well at delivering a &quot;sane-by-default&quot; system.  Mind, Ubuntu and Debian are getting damned good at this as well, as is Google via Android.<p>But to say that Mac is a foregone conclusion is hardly the case (as many here note).",1400650877
7776858,comment,7773253,7774927,1,0,comex,,,"I haven&#x27;t read esr, but I disagree with your categorical statement that &quot;producing better software&quot; is hard to justify.  (In other words, I agree with your first paragraph&#x27;s statement that open source&#x27;s superiority is not demonstrably not true.)<p>In my experience, if you look at the big ticket projects, there are many proprietary packages that are less buggy than free alternatives, and many which are more buggy, and it mostly depends on the project&#x27;s development process and history.  For example, OpenSSL and gdb are very buggy mainly because they&#x27;re terrible code, while Linux and OpenBSD are in general fairly stable because their development processes are good and in turn have made the code good.  gcc and Clang beat MSVC++, Chrome beats Internet Explorer, because Microsoft doesn&#x27;t care enough; Photoshop handily beats GIMP because it&#x27;s Photoshop.  And so on.<p>But in my humble opinion, if you average over _all_ the software... including a lot of little projects that seem to end up with higher quality code, if only because the author was too embarrassed to release low quality code, and perhaps with the help of a few bug reports on GitHub... including medium-size projects which someone else took over maintainership over after the original quit, which would be impossible with proprietary software... including lots of low-quality proprietary NIH code where the default open source solution would be to use some already well-tested external code... open source wins by a significant margin.  I am not sure this is inevitable or even correct, as proprietary software certainly has significant advantages, but I do not think it is reasonable to say it is demonstrably false.",1400650874
