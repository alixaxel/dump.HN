Mercurial uses some similar code. The expected behavior would be that foo/bar/tmp/file replaced /foo/bar/baz/file. Instead, the outcome was that there was a race in Gluster where it got confused about which version of &#x27;file&#x27; was correct, and it would end up with a split brain between the two nodes. This would be exacerbated by a node failure, but didn&#x27;t always require one. Heavy load seemed to make the failure more likely. We couldn&#x27;t replicate the same bug moving files in the same folder, it was the subfolders in the same gluster fs that seemed to cause the issue. The frustrating part was how gluster pointed fingers at the file operation being incompatible, despite advertising a posix compatible filesystem. Apparently the bug is fixed, but we moved off gluster, never to return.<p>Also, filesystems are hard, I get it, so no hard feelings :)",1399250795

Things like asserting — in an idempotent way — the existence of files (with the right content, the right ownership and mode flags, etc.), services, packages and so on.<p>Tools like Ansible and Puppet already provide that set of functionality. If you write it yourself, you pretty much end up with something like Ansible, except it&#x27;s specific only to your use case. Better to focus on commonality.<p>I&#x27;m a Puppet guy myself (although I appreciate the simplicity Ansible can bring to the table), and make extensive use not just of the primitives, but of the ability to bundle primitives as reusable modules. For example, rather than explicitly putting files in /etc/logrotate.d, I define a &quot;logrotate class&quot; and do:<p><pre><code>    logrotate::rotation {\n      postgresql:\n        pattern => &quot;/var/log/postgresql/*.log&quot;,\n        keep_count => 10,\n        require => Package[&#x27;postgresql&#x27;];\n    }\n</code></pre>\nHowever, this is not merely a macro that is expanded in-place. Rather, it&#x27;s an object which can be referenced (for example, I can have something else which requires that the object Logrotate::Rotation[postgresql] runs first) as well as &quot;inventoried&quot; (I can ask the system about all the log rotations that have been declared, and use that to drive a UI, for example).<p>The expressiveness and flexibility of tools like Ansible (which must have something similar) and Puppet is best seen in a multi-node server environment, however.",1399250624

It&#x27;s possible to define a &quot;deceiver&quot; program that will use the oracle itself to change it&#x27;s behavior.<p><pre><code>    def deceiver(oracle):\n      if oracle(Deceiver, oracle):\n        while True:\n          continue\n      return\n\n    print oracle(deceiver, oracle)\n</code></pre>\nThis doesn&#x27;t mean that an external observer doesn&#x27;t know whether running the oracle on the deceiver halts, but that it&#x27;s impossible to write an oracle within that machine which will be a real oracle, since it will give a wrong answer for the deceiver program (and hence it wouldn&#x27;t be an oracle).<p>Or, put in other words, even on a machine with finite memory, it&#x27;s impossible to write a program (the oracle) in that machine that determines whether any possible program on that machine halts, because &quot;any&quot; program includes the oracle itself.<p>But what does &quot;define a program that runs within that machine&quot; mean?<p>Let&#x27;s cheat a little bit. What if we build a machine that will record all it&#x27;s internal states somewhere and when it detects that a program cannot possibly halt (because it reached a previously recorded state) asserts some IO line that can cause the cpu make it look like the oracle returns true?<p><pre><code>    def oracle(program, input):\n      # registerTrap will only work the first time it&#x27;s executed\n      # then it will be nop.\n      registerTrap(on IO.cycleDetected, do nonLocalReturn(false))\n      call program(input)\n</code></pre>\nWhat did we achieve with this cheat? Now we can execute an oracle which will soon enter in a cycle\nexecuting oracle -> deceiver -> oracle -> .... and then the IO line will be asserted which will cause the oracle to abort the execution and return false (the program doesn&#x27;t halt).<p>It can be argued that this oracle is non deterministic, because it won&#x27;t give any answer when it&#x27;s executed by the oracle itself (i.e. it won&#x27;t terminate, only the outer oracle terminates).\nBut nowhere we did specify that the oracle had to be reentrant!<p>Note that we didn&#x27;t include the IO.cycleDetected input as part of the program input, because it&#x27;s not an input.\nIn fact, the IO.cycleDetected bit can be seen as part of the machine state. It&#x27;s a state that is modifiable by the program by introducing a cycle in all other states (except this bit).\nBut by reaching this subset of states (all of the states which include the IO.cycleDetected bit set),\nthe machine halts AND the oracle correctly computes whether ANY program halts, including deceivers which invoke the oracle itself.<p>The main trick is to introduce hidden (inaccessible) states in the system: the write-once trap handler and the &quot;detected cycle&quot; state. This is not a &quot;pure&quot; machine, but it can nevertheless be built.<p>But what does this mean? We showed that it&#x27;s possible to create a machine which can execute a program\nwhich can tell if any possible program of that machine terminates.<p>Can we build a machine where this is impossible? Yes. We just have to give to every program the\npossibility to get to all possible states, including the ones that would stomp on any attempt by any kind of oracle to determine whether there has been a cycle.<p>Imagine a degenerate case of a machine allowing any program to just &quot;reboot&quot; the execution of the oracle. The oracle itself couldn&#x27;t possibly know that it has been unwound and thus cannot ever return saying so.<p>But we can always discern this situation if we look from outside.\nBut what if the top level oracle performs a simulation of the machine? Even if the deceiver reboots, the oracle could still detect cycles by checking the simulated state. However, the inner oracle cannot do the same thing, because it would require infinitely nested simulators and we have only finite memory.<p>So there will always be one layer which doesn&#x27;t allow to execute a working oracle from within.",1399249583
