He has essentially a guarantee of lifelong employment, with a salary that today equates to something around 3000€/month pre-tax.

Yup, 27.7 years of pre-tax salary for a small house. And mind you, this is not even a capital city.",1400227179

Same as you regulate electricity company, water, gas etc. You can&#x27;t just let everyone dig holes around city to place new wires, pipes etc. There&#x27;s no other way then regulating it.<p>BTW: If Comcast and Time Warner would move to a different methods of delivering access then it&#x27;s all even better we will have more alternatives than just cable, or dsl. If instead they would decide to close down and sell, then I&#x27;m sure there would be plenty of other companies who would want to purchase their infrastructure with their subscribers to make money out of it.",1400226994

Some of those 1% have millions of records so HLL is very useful.  As the HLL itself is a fixed size (~10kb for decent accuracy) regardless of #counted objects, in the small case you can replace the HLL with a pure set of counted values and produce a HLL when it grows beyond a bound.  Because you&#x27;re storing the raw values, the transition to HLL is seamless.<p>Once you&#x27;ve moved beyond raw storage of values there&#x27;s a harder but still space-saving technique.  If you look at the raw bytes of a ~10kb HLL structure with &quot;only&quot; 10&#x27;s of thousands of counted values around 90% of them will be zero.  Below a certain bound it can save a lot of space to have a map of locations and non-zero byte values rather than a raw array of bytes.",1400226657

This is because the optimal reading width is actually relatively narrow compared to our widescreen monitors, and going past that makes documents frustrating to read. As a result, whenever I hit + and the application expands to the full width of the screen, I very often have to grab an edge and drag it back to the center a little bit.

Ten years of war in the middle east killed only a tenth of the US soldiers killed in Vietnam, and there was <i>no conscription</i>. Before the downfall of the USSR, there was a very palpable fear of nuclear war in the West (justified or not) or a sizeable military invasion. Civil and social rights for minorities and women were far, far behind where they are now. In the consumer world, shit is cheaper and more disposable than ever before. Much less need to put effort into maintaining things, just get another one.  Hell, even going to the dentist is far easier today with improvements in pain control.

Idealised financial transactions end with &quot;win/lose&quot;, whereas ruining a whole economy like that results in years of decreased quality of life for other individuals, which has a moral implication. Soros was undoubtedly aware that his transaction would disadvantage a huge number of people, but did it anyway. He could have acted in such a way that netted him lots of money (a million, 10 million, 100 million) whilst still minimising taxpayer losses, but he didn&#x27;t at all.<p>So in pure, simplified transactional terms, yeah fair game.

Last summer I flew back to my Midwestern hometown for a concert, and I still remember being introduced to a friend of a friend. She was a college graduate one year removed, vastly &#x27;underemployed&#x27; [1], and living in her parents basement.<p>When my friend mentioned that I was just in town from SF for the weekend, she asked what I did and after telling her, her reaction was something along the lines of &#x27;oh you&#x27;re like a real grown up!&#x27; Her tone was one of embarrassment and a begrudging acceptance of where she was, and it&#x27;s one I&#x27;ve seen a fair bit despite going to a pretty solid school. Not Ivy League, mind you, but a reasonably high-ranked state school.<p>I really have no idea what the solution is, but I&#x27;ve thought a fair bit about the as of yet unrealized ripple effects: Many of these people are in debt up to their eyeballs. Given that, they&#x27;re going to be much less likely to (or at least will significantly delay) purchases of cars and real estate. Dating is a lot harder when you&#x27;re living at your parents&#x27;, and I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see an impact in the ratio of singles/families among my generation as a result. Then there&#x27;s the whole psychological impact of feeling they have nothing going for them that the article focuses on. Pretty dismal scene.<p>[1] Honestly, I hate this term. It shouldn&#x27;t be any surprise to us that when we promote an &#x27;everyone goes to college!&#x27; culture a la &#x27;everyone&#x27;s a home owner!&#x27;, coupled with an insidious lowering of standards in our education system starting in the lower rungs of K-12, we&#x27;ll have a mass of college-educated individuals who can&#x27;t find gainful employment.",1400223629
