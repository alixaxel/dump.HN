If you are using something like PHP and the forking model (most common MPM configuration), you can only handle as many requests as you have workers; additionally you are spinning up a full PHP interpreter when serving static assets. In my experience[1], putting Nginx in front of Apache to serve static assets and leaving Apache as a sort of application server is one of the lowest hanging fruit in scaling a LAMP application.<p>[1] Was Co-Founder/CTO of a medium-sized PHP PaaS company",1401109128

(2) Since each query has corresponding code object, this code object can be used as a cache key. Because of this, Pony ORM translates each query only once, whereas Django and SQLAlchemy have to translate the same query again and again. (3) As Pony ORM uses IdentityMap pattern, it caches query results within the same transaction. There is a post (in russian) where author states that Pony ORM turned out to be 1.5-3 times faster than Django and SQLAlchemy even without query result caching: <a href=""http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&ie=UTF8&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fhabrahabr.ru%2Fpost%2F188842%2F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/translate?hl=en&ie=UTF8&sl=auto&tl=en&...</a>",1401108985

7799519,comment,7788532,7793708,1,0,jrochkind1,,,"Me, I&#x27;d keep implicit Strings (meaning optional to use quotes, for convenience), but stick to JSON-compatible data types. For most cases where YAML is used, what&#x27;s really wnated is something that is pretty much exactly as expressive as json (no more), but easier and neater to write/read by hand.<p>Of course, I realize the devil is in the details, and that may be what those developing YAML thought they were doing, but always adding just one more tiny thing that would be useful too.<p>Complexity vs flexibility, one of the fundamental tensions of software design. I see how we got here through good intentions, but in retrospect YAML made some decisions on this balance that most of us would do differently.  Or, did those designing YAML realize what a fundamental part of the ruby ecosystem it was to become, and what the implications of that were?   Maybe part of the lesson is that some things really do need to be carefully designed, not just iteratively designed &quot;you can always fix it later&quot; by an ever-changing community of volunteers; is that part of what happened with YAML spec and implementations and uses?<p>Also, thanks for explaining the bug-fix as part of the story, that makes a lot more sense. I understand that bug fixes will inevitably sometimes be backward-incompat. I think it has maybe been consistently under-estimated how important/useful it would to allow upgrades of ruby itself while keeping the exact same YAML processor and version. The psych/syck stuff ended up being one of the biggest pain points for many people way back in 1.8.7->1.9.3 too.  Most gems ended up compatible with multiple ruby versions, so you could upgrade ruby versions while keeping your gem dependencies identical. YAML serializing/parsing, so fundamental, where minor differences in implementation can have disastrous consequences, was a painful exception.",1401108573

I love that you&#x27;re lifestyle hacking and I love the dream you&#x27;re going for, but if you&#x27;re a web developer, you have a present day super power that is not only in really high demand itself, but you can put it to work for yourself to create derivative works for which there is a substantial demand.<p>My recommendation is this: If you&#x27;re currently salaried, find out how to become an independent consultant to free yourself from full-time employment. If you do this wrong, it&#x27;s worse than full-time employment. If you do it right, you&#x27;ll make the same amount of money working half as many hours.<p>From there, identify pain points that still exist across multiple clients or leverage some insight you have into an industry you&#x27;ve worked in to create a business-to-business software-as-a-service product that generates recurring revenue.<p>It may take a couple years to figure it all out, but I have no doubt you can eventually launch a product that is bringing in the £4166.67 a month you want to save £1,000,000 over 20 years while also doing 20 hours a week in consulting if you still need that to cover your ongoing expenses. (I know a serious lifehacker who has that number down to 5 hours a week with a spouse and two kids, and he doesn&#x27;t have a SaaS product yet. They&#x27;re currently driving around the U.S. in an R.V. on a hunt for their perfect town to live in.) That would be on the low end of success in this space. It&#x27;s also quite likely, you&#x27;ll make much more in monthly recurring revenue and you can get out of consulting entirely if that&#x27;s what you want to do.<p>There are a handful of people who have done this one way or another who are super open and transparent about it, which may be really helpful for you and other people who are interested in doing the same. A couple that come to mind are Patrick McKenzie and recently Josh Pigford. However, if you connect personally with other people who are doing this in chat rooms and such, you&#x27;ll find that many people are quite open and willing to share numbers, tactics, advice, etc. if they feel it will help someone drum up confidence and help guide them along the way.<p>I think the first step is transitioning from full-time employment to consulting, because then you can scale your time commitment to people paying you up and down as you need to in order to build your business. And you never have to kick the coffee and wine habit you enjoy... just do another hour of work every two weeks.",1401108127
