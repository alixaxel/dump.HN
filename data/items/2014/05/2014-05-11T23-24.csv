7730505,comment,7729831,7730445,4,0,Pacabel,,,"Well, after each desktop Firefox update I ask myself, &quot;Am I better off now than I was with the last version?&quot;<p>In the Phoenix, Firebird and Firefox pre-4 days, I&#x27;d quite often find myself answering with &quot;Yes&quot;. Since Firefox 4, though, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve answered with &quot;Yes&quot; even once. Sometimes I&#x27;m not any better or worse off, but most times I&#x27;m worse off.<p>For example, extensions would break very frequently for a long time after Firefox 4 was released, although they eventually managed to get that straightened out. Then there&#x27;s been the progressive dumbing-down of the UI, to the sorry state of affairs after the recent Firefox 29 release containing the Australis disaster. Useful functionality has also been removed, such as the status bar and the ability to disable JavaScript through the preferences dialog. With each update, a lot of us users now have to install more and more extensions just to restore useful functionality that has been removed.<p>Worst of all, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s been any significant improvement in its RAM usage, its speed, and other factors like those. Yeah, I know about the are-we-fast-yet style benchmarks, but those don&#x27;t translate well to the actual experience when using Firefox. Chrome, as much as I dislike its UI, still feels far more responsive and efficient than Firefox.<p>As for Mobile Firefox, yeah, I&#x27;m comparing it to other mobile browsers from Google and Opera, for instance. I find it slower, I&#x27;ve had it crash more, and I don&#x27;t think it really offers any significant benefits. If it&#x27;s no better than its competitors, and worse in some ways, it inherently can&#x27;t offer a good experience.<p>And it&#x27;s nonsense to suggest that Persona was &quot;widely used&quot;. It saw basically no adoption, compared to its competitors. The same seems to be happening with Firefox OS. Some people try it out, and there is some hype, but it&#x27;s still a very, very marginal player in the big picture. It won&#x27;t have any impact on &quot;walled gardens&quot; when almost nobody actually uses it. And in many ways it forces developers into a &quot;walled garden&quot; worse than that of its competitors, with JavaScript/HTML5/CSS basically being the only option for developing applications.<p>From a technical standpoint, the Asm.js versus Native Client debate is over. Native Client is a much more general, technologically-superior approach. Asm.js is basically just a human-unfriendly subset of JavaScript, without the benefits that a more general approach offers.<p>I think the Rust crew could have pulled off Rust 1.0 by the end of the year had they stabilized the language and standard library a few months back. But that didn&#x27;t happen, and we&#x27;re still seeing relatively significant breaking changes happening to this day. It just doesn&#x27;t leave them much time all to freeze the language and libraries, and to then give it the significant amount of testing and bug fixing required of a respectable 1.0 release, before the end of 2014.",1399852041

7730493,comment,7730275,7730275,3,0,rolleiflex,,,"Disclaimer: I&#x27;m creator of a mesh network, or a decentralised, anonymous &#x27;reddit&#x27; called Aether.[0] [1] I&#x27;m probably biased.<p>The main problem with these networks is not the declining user interest per se, it&#x27;s rather that they are by their own nature, a) very hard to engineer, and b) almost impossible to monetise. The engineering effort required to make a decentralised network reach resilience (and visible uptime) of the most basic Rails web app on Heroku is orders of magnitude away from just hosting it.<p>For A, Decentralisation is a cruel mistress; every assumption you will make about computers connecting to your network will slowly fall apart as you move deeper into the architecture, engineering and design of your services—that makes it a fascinating challenge as much as a hard one fortunately. On the more unfortunate side, you eventually end up with cases that require you to entirely reëngineer your stack to provide for them; and not providing them access is philosophically against the democratic access decentralisation offers. For starters, anything higher than C/C++ is probably a non–starter, a lesson I learned the hard way. My own work is built in Python and getting it to perform adequately well on even most medium–grade computers has been a challenge. Distributed network means distributed loads, and there is a significant amount of computers who aren&#x27;t able to pull their own weight on the Internet, especially in the developing world.<p>It also means that you&#x27;ll be bogged down with a lot of platform support issues, small bugs etc.<p>For B, there are two issues. The first issue is that in a decentralised network it&#x27;s almost impossible to target a specific person or entity to pay if you&#x27;re not willing to create an exception for yourself (i.e. all computers able to call your servers, and consequently in absence of your servers the network goes down) but if you&#x27;re willing to do that, you can just make it into a traditional system in the first place, and you just made it both subject to your whims, and as fragile as any other centralised service. That&#x27;s a no-go.<p>Beyond this, the moral imperative is that you <i>shouldn&#x27;t</i> be charging for a service that doesn&#x27;t cost you money to maintain. For additional services, sure, but you still need to figure out how to attach an additional service without which the core network continues to function.<p>In general, it&#x27;s a massive engineering task that isn&#x27;t lucrative, and the effort required to maintain and keep functional increases exponentially as the network scales. For me, I&#x27;m stuck at packaging the new version for the last few months because PyInstaller doesn&#x27;t like the way I split Aether into two applications—and you end up with these corner cases nobody on the entire Internet has ever encountered before. There&#x27;s no Stack Overflow for that. It&#x27;s fun, but it&#x27;s also tiring.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/27/5150758/aether-aims-to-be-a-reddit-for-the-privacy-conscious"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2013/11/27/5150758/aether-aims-to-be...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.getaether.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.getaether.net</a>",1399851650

I think its a really contrived argument, and shows exactly what I&#x27;m talking about: big money companies are trying to justify laws that favor them by raising totally hypothetical concerns about what companies may do to small entities that have some public interest benefit.<p>If Comcast et al really try to keep sex workers from getting needed information about health risks, let&#x27;s address it when it happens with a targeted law.

They have certain properties emphasized, and certain other properties de-emphasized right now, but that&#x27;s it.<p>I actually didn&#x27;t go far enough in my error detection and correction examples, I only went few thousand years back. There&#x27;s an even more ancient example, going back millions of years... the process of DNA replication itself:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading_(Biology)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofreading_(Biology)</a><p>One shouldn&#x27;t be surprised to discover that some cellular process might have stumbled onto heap sorting, either.<p>System design is bigger and older than any of us. To think otherwise is just a sign our culture is just too young yet to appreciate where we fit in the world. In some ways, it seems we still think we&#x27;re at the center of the Universe.<p>We&#x27;re not inventing algorithms, just rediscovering them. This doesn&#x27;t make any of the achievements of our inventors any lesser, but it&#x27;s good to keep in mind the big picture. It helps us, among other things, to look in more places for inspiration and knowledge, and in turn, create better systems.",1399849293

And so I&#x27;d be very willing to directly donate money to them, as well.<p>However, a lot of their recent actions have seriously dissuaded me from doing so.<p>Desktop Firefox, for example, has gotten progressively worse over time. A lot of useful functionality has been stripped out, and the Chrome-like UI these days is much less efficient and effective than the Firefox 3.5.x UI was.<p>Mobile Firefox on Android doesn&#x27;t exactly offer a very pleasant experience.<p>They basically gave up on Thunderbird.<p>They&#x27;ve wasted resources on unnecessary and unwanted efforts like Persona and Firefox OS.<p>Asm.js is not a very sound approach, especially compared to technology like Native Client.<p>Rust seems promising, but won&#x27;t be seriously usable until at least Rust 1.0, which still seems a long way off. As the year progresses, I get more and more doubtful that it&#x27;ll be out during 2014, like was claimed earlier this year.<p>As it stands now, Mozilla is now offering me far less useful products than they once were. I&#x27;ve also seen them squander a lot of the resources they already had on unnecessary products. And their future offerings aren&#x27;t very inspiring, either. I just can&#x27;t convince myself that any donation I do make would be used in a productive manner, I&#x27;m sad to say.",1399849286
