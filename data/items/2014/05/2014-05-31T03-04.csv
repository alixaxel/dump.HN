7825210,comment,7821808,7822549,5,0,tptacek,,,"Just to be clear about this subthread between &#x27;will_brown and &#x27;dragonwriter:<p>They are talking about the <i>reverse</i> of the case most people think about when they think about corporate liability protection. Specifically, they&#x27;re talking about the way the law handles the case where your <i>personal</i> liabilities spill over into your <i>company&#x27;s</i> liabilities.<p>For example: if, unrelated to your work, you hit someone with your car and end up losing a $100k lawsuit, your victim will investigate attaching that liability to your equity in your company. With C and S corporations, this isn&#x27;t complicated: an attorney pursuing a collection can take your shares to satisfy the liability. This is possible because C and S corporations have mostly straightforward rules for transferable stock ownership.<p>But due to a quirk in the law, LLCs don&#x27;t. LLCs are glorified partnerships; they are a way of getting most of the benefits of a corporate form with much less of the pain of forming an actual corporation. As a result, there is no straightforward way for a court to transfer partial ownership of the LLC to a creditor; to do so would be to impact all the other LLC members, who did not agree to partner with the debt collector.<p>The obvious result of this quirk is that people form LLCs to protect personal assets from collection. An attorney pursuing a collection can attach themselves in some ways to the beneficial interest in the LLC, but they cannot get any decisionmaking power for the LLC, and they cannot get transferable stock in the LLC (which stock doesn&#x27;t exist). So, as long as the LLC never issues a distribution, the assets housed in it can potentially be judgement-proof.<p>Since this is a loophole for debtors big enough to drive a truck through, some states have legal precedent that gives special consideration to single-member LLCs to make them easier to collect against, since the whole rationale for them being difficult to collect against is the protection of other innocent partners, which don&#x27;t exist in an SMLLC.<p>Now you know, and knowing is half the battle.",1401508635

7825205,comment,7824997,7825174,2,0,nlawalker,,,"While &quot;free&quot; does indeed cause strange behavior in people, I think both of the specific behaviors you discuss are better attributed to other causes.<p>For HiddenCash: People <i>love</i> scavenger hunts and game-like challenges, especially when there&#x27;s an opportunity to beat out hundreds of other people competing for the same thing. The reasonably large sums are the reason for the press coverage and popularity of this specific set of scavenger hunts, but I think that their sustained popularity from here on out is largely independent of the value of the prize (in either case, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to last too much longer).<p>That said, it&#x27;s worth keeping in mind that a couple hundred bucks is a TON of money to a lot of people, and the fact that all they have to do is find it first is very appealing.<p>For fund-raisers: It&#x27;s often important to people to feel joined with a cause, and donating time can create an emotional link that donating money may not.<p>On an unrelated note - geocaching evangelists should be milking this, they have an opportunity to attract a lot of people who have found that they enjoy scavenger hunts.",1401508411

Rather than keeping track of peoples number yourself, this third-party will do it for you.<p>So, when is it that you do not want to call an operator to patch every call you make? Ask yourself this question, knowing that the operator keeps a list of every incoming and outgoing call. Know that they sometimes also lie and say that the party you are calling is not reachable, while in fact the operator simply refuses to connect you. Some operators will even send you to a telemarketer in order to monetize poorly stated questions.<p>On the positive side, it is faster. Asking your ISP for every DNS resolving does sometime give an increase speed by shaving a few milliseconds the first time you connect to a website.
