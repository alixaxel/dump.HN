There&#x27;s even a catalog of the equipment they have ready-made replacements for and a price sheet (presumably for internal cost accounting) that leaked a few months ago.<p>Like many private-sector security consulting companies, they also do security research - looking for vulnerabilities accidentally left behind by naive programmers. They leaked a catalog of exploits written for vulnerabilities discovered (or bought) but not disclosed. Failure to disclose these is a violation of its mission to protect the security of US infrastructure, but I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m surprised that an intelligence agency that pays hackers has some exploits to show for it.<p>Aside from doubt cast onto the validity of NSA&#x27;s advice on cryptography standards, there is <i>not</i> evidence that NSA actually introduces backdoors into the design of mass-produced products.<p>If you&#x27;re not interesting enough for the NSA to physically intercept your package from, say, Cisco, (or, for the more cynical, ask Cisco to put the &quot;special&quot; version of IOS on your router) your inspection of the gear says nothing about what&#x27;s running on an apparently identical unit headed for a foreign government.<p>Granted, &quot;only&quot; targeting a handful communications companies may well give them access to most of the world&#x27;s communications, but this &quot;NSA is deliberately backdooring everything&quot; business is vastly exaggerated from the evidence.",1399935551

You end-up running a huge compressor for a small zone.<p>I&#x27;ve always like the idea of chiller systems and the general concept of storing what you need during times of high efficiency to bend the curve in your direction.<p>I haven&#x27;t done any math on this at all but I&#x27;ve wondered what it might be like to cool the massive foundation slab most homes have as well as the ground directly underneath them during the night.  Again, I haven&#x27;t thought this through at all.  Just thinking now that you would want to treat the soil in order to have a stab at improving heat capacity, etc.  You could then use that during the day in a very careful way to compensate for heat flow.  I almost envision radiator panels embedded into the walls with sensors to pump heat into the cold ground only as needed.  Anyhow, there&#x27;s probably a million things wrong with that idea.  Air conditioning is one of these things that could be so much better.",1399935551
7735884,comment,7731753,7731753,1,0,akiselev,,,"> A huge, naked pile of nuclear waste has sat beneath Oklo for billions of years; why not put a bit more under the Nevada desert, in shielded canisters no less?<p>Most of our nuclear waste is <i>nothing</i> like the nuclear &quot;waste&quot; in Oklo [1]. The primary danger comes not from the reactor but from the enrichment process and uranium hexaflouride (UF6). During enrichment, fissile uranium atoms are extracted to make &quot;enriched&quot; uranium while the rest (over 90%!) of the UF6, which is very toxic and reacts with air and water to form extremely corrosive compounds, is stored in gas cylinders as &quot;depleted&quot; uranium.<p>Think about that again: we use metal gas canisters to store toxic waste, waste that reacts with some of the most abundant molecules to form more chemicals that slowly destroy the canister. Depending on how these containers are stored and maintained, the UF6 leaks into the air or, even worse, into our ground water reservoirs, taking the non-fissile but still radioactive uranium with it.<p>Injecting our nuclear waste into the Earth like we do carbon sequestration would be great, but we just don&#x27;t have the millions of years to wait for the uranium to pass through the ground water system or the technology to figure how and where our reservoirs interconnect (or even how big most of them are). Until we do, storing waste like Oklo is just a step shy of giving everyone some old Fiesta Ware.<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/</a>",1399935505

An A/C unit has to be off for a large chunk of time per day to save $100 per month.<p>There&#x27;s the other element here which is just plain being lazy and wanting to be comfortable 100% of the time.  No, I am not calling you this.  Just making a general statement.  I&#x27;ve walked into my home when it is 80 to 85 degrees F.  I don&#x27;t need the air conditioner to turn on an hour before I get home to get it down to 72 degrees (or whatever).  I am perfectly fine getting home and turning it on (if the programmable thermostat didn&#x27;t) and waiting 15 to 20 minutes while having a cold glass of water as it the temperature goes down.<p>Yet another reality is that the cooling process is far more efficient the longer you can wait.  What I mean by this is that a good air conditioning unit is cycle limited to somewhere around a 50 degree F delta between outside and inside temperatures.  That&#x27;s governed by the physics of the heat exchange circuit.  And so, in simple terms, if it is cooler outside your A/C unit will be able to cool your house much faster because it is able to pump cooler air into your  home.  There&#x27;s a huge difference between trying to cool a house with 60 degree air vs. 50 degree air.<p>Finally, one thing you can probably do as a renter is to install a misting system around the A/C condensing unit (usually installed outside the house).  Wet air has greater heat capacity than dry air and so the system will operate more efficiently. It is easy to rig a 12 or 24 volt solenoid valve to open when the compressor runs so the mister can provide moist air to the heat exchanger.  This alone is bound to produce results significantly better --again-- than a Nest.  And, of course, it wouldn&#x27;t cost much more than $30 to $50 to implement.<p>In places where people can&#x27;t be bothered to at least attempt to understand the situation and at the very least spend some time programming their thermostat, setting reasonable temperatures and taking five minutes to open windows at night, well, yeah, Nest might serve in a range from placebo to small savings.<p>My key argument is that a single thermostat isn&#x27;t a solution to a systemic problem.  Most homes are not designed to be efficient in this regard, which is sad.",1399934984

7735851,comment,7735452,7735452,16,0,zaroth,,,"[Not quite TLDR, but call it Cliff Notes... most of this is directly quoted, but I have done some editorializing.]<p>In 2001, some researchers at UCLA discovered that fat cells (adipose) contain an abundance of adult stem cells. Separate out the mature fat cells and the remaining cells, which they called PLA, can be coaxed into forming bone and cartilage.<p>Jalees Rehman and Keith March at Indiana University decided to see if they could use these cells to repair the heart and grow new blood vessels. Their &quot;goal was to convert fat stem cells from liposuction aspirates into cardiovascular cells, such as cardiomyocytes or endothelial cells that form the lining of all blood vessels.&quot;<p>Over the course of the next year, although they had a few cultures that did seem to behave like cardiac cells, they couldn&#x27;t reliably produce them.<p>The team learned of reports that adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells released growth factors that nourished and accelerated the regeneration of neighbouring cells. Researchers were increasingly calling these stem cells ‘stromal cells’, from the Latin ‘stroma’ for mattress or covering, to signify their support function.<p>They decided to try growing PLA cells side by side with endothelial cells and studying what occurred. When they added PLA cells to the gels, the growth of the blood-vessel-like tubes increased several-fold. &quot;Analysing the PLA genes and proteins they produced, we found not one, but a multitude of factors that promoted survival, regeneration and growth of blood vessels. Synergy between all the factors likely explained why they were so effective. These growth factors not only activated the growth of endothelial cells, they also made endothelial cells more resilient to stress. In the aftermath of this work, I decided to rename PLA cells ‘adipose stromal cells’ (ASCs), to emphasise the fact that it was their ‘stromal’ or caretaker function that aided in their ability to form blood vessels.&quot;<p>Especially important was the discovery that ASCs did not just blindly churn out growth factors. Their productivity was regulated by the cell’s ability to sense oxygen. When placed in a low-oxygen environment, the ASCs doubled or tripled production of factors necessary for the growth of blood vessels. Since heart and limb muscle tissues of patients with blood vessel blockages suffer from low oxygen levels; implanting ASCs that released therapeutic molecules based on oxygen levels seemed almost too good to be true.<p>They did a preliminary test on mice, and met with success. (why does it always work on mice?!) They cut off blood supply to the lower parts of the legs of experimental mice. Half the mice then received an injection of human ASCs into the leg muscle. We observed an astonishing recovery of blood flow through new blood vessels in ASC-treated mice, but not our controls.<p>Since then, clinical trials are proceeding somewhat rapidly, in part due to FDA exemptions for treatment with one’s own cells, as long as modifications are no more than minor and cells are re-injected during the same procedure.  &quot;The irony is that the less effort such clinics spend on processing and characterising the cells they are injecting into patients, the more likely they are to get away with it.&quot; These exemptions may encourage treating with under-processed cells, since too much processing voids the exemption, but it remains to be seen if theres low-hanging fruit here, or if scientists will have to work much harder to refine the processing in order to see actual clinical benefit from injecting ASC.",1399934940

There&#x27;s one in Downtown San Jose\n  * (cheated, this is in SF) California Academy of Science throws NightLife every Thursday night -- it&#x27;s science + alcohol + music\n  * (cheated again, sorry!)

Singlebarrel in San Jose or Steinsbeer in Mountain View or Old Pro in Palo Alto\n  * some coffeehouses frequented by developers: Coupa Cafe, Red Rock, any Philz\n  * try out some Boba drinks if you haven&#x27;t had them before!\n  * Stanford&#x27;s Art Museum is free (if you plan on going, I&#x27;m a big fan of Ike&#x27;s Sandwiches located on campus)\n  * San Jose has the Tech Museum and Museum of Art\n</code></pre>\nI hope you enjoy your visit!

I forget whether sampling options like filtering mode are part of that, or part of a separate structure - either way, in GL sampling is part of the texture, while in D3D it is separately configurable which is a GODSEND.<p>IIRC in modern versions of D3D (10+? 11+?) they&#x27;ve expanded on this and just have the general concepts of views and buffers, so that you can treat textures and vertex buffers as if they share underlying properties, and shader code can manipulate them in similar ways.

Besides the fact that existing apps already rely on the fact that UIWebView isn&#x27;t remote (because they can muck about with various view properties of it, including direct access to its UIScrollView), UIWebView also exposes at least one synchronous API (-stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString:) and synchronous APIs are no good when doing stuff out-of-process. It also has a delegate that runs in a synchronous mode (e.g. it&#x27;s asked questions it has to answer by returning a value, instead of just being notified of events or using a callback-based response), and that&#x27;s the same problem as synchronous APIs (because now the remote process has to block waiting on a response from UIWebView).<p>WebKit2 is an existing effort by Apple to do out-of-process rendering. Various desktop apps already use it, including Safari, Mail, and iBooks. It features new APIs for doing everything, because it&#x27;s all asynchronous. If third-party iOS apps gain out-of-process rendering it will be through WebKit2 and not some attempt to port UIWebView to the remote view controller system.<p>Incidentally, the same synchronous issues with UIWebView that I mentioned above suggest that porting to WebKit2 is a non-backwards-compatible change. If Apple makes this change, I would guess that either they&#x27;ll introduce a separate UIWebView class that&#x27;s used for WebKit2 and leave the existing UIWebView alone, or they&#x27;ll give UIWebView two modes, a WebKit mode and a WebKit2 mode, and whichever mode it uses will be selected at initialization time (and using a WebKit method on a WebKit2 UIWebView would be an error, and vice versa).

I thought I enjoyed that, since I felt a little victory rush when it finally worked.<p>However, I recently bought a Macbook Air, and haven&#x27;t looked back.  The form factor is amazing, the trackpad is the best I&#x27;ve experienced so far, and I feel pretty close to home with the underlying Unix OS. Workspaces in OS X are really great.<p>I find myself WAY more productive with my Macbook than I ever was on Linux.  I&#x27;m never wrestling with the OS (as cliché as it is, pretty much everything &quot;just works&quot;), and I&#x27;m still empowered to tweak my environment to my liking. The software available for the Mac is pretty consistently great (even though I almost always have to pay for it, I don&#x27;t mind).  Alfred 2 (an application launcher/productivity tool), along with the Powerpack, has saved me untold hours of productivity: I rarely have to take my fingers off the keyboard while working.  Dash (a local docset manager) has rescued me numerous times while working offline, and has saved me a good bit of time (Ctrl+H in Sublime -> API docs on the spot).<p>Overall, it&#x27;s all the little things that add up to making it a wonderful experience.

You should also expect that expenses incurred independent of specific performance of the contract will not be reimbursed.<p>So take your target salary, add the costs of cell phone, computer, laptop, etc plus all your routine costs (internet access, cell phone, business phone, etc) plus all benefits (time off, sick pay, life insurance, health insurance, disability insurance, retirement plan contributions, etc) plus your downtime costs (it is highly unlikely you will contract 40 hours a week every week for the whole year, so you will have unbillable time while you search out your next gig).<p>You will have to do the math for yourself, but it probably comes to an additional 50-100% of your current salary rate.

Demanding that Chrome be allowed to run their C++ code would be like demanding that Google makes it so that Firefox OS can be installed on Android phones, replacing the Android system. They don&#x27;t do that, instead they offer up to developers the same facilities to write their apps that they reserve for their own apps.  GMail for Android is written using the same language and APIs that you can use for your own application.<p>Firefox OS is providing the same thing.  They don&#x27;t allow you to just replace the OS, which in this case is the browser, but all applications, including their own are written with the same APIs available to you the developer. They aren&#x27;t writing some of their own apps in C++ and then demanding everyone else write in Javascript. Apple is writing their own JIT and then demanding that everyone else interpret, which is not at all equivalent.<p>The difference here is that the browser <i>is</i> the OS. So the OS is at a certain level which you cannot replace or step into willy nilly. Think of it like Windows enforcing Hardware access through its drivers, not allowing you to just send whatever you want to someone&#x27;s disk drive and possibly do damage to the device. In the same way, they enforce a level of Memory protection through the runtime, and after that they are on the same footing as you.  We accept these constraints when we run OSs all the time, and I don&#x27;t see it as being much different here.",1399932022
