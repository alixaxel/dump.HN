Presumably, those details were not viewed as critical to this discussion, but it is an interesting point to note.<p>I suspect that concepts and processes could be covered under trade secret IP law, but in the case of software in specific, it would seem the safer bet to have patents in place if possible (but again, according to Carmack, he has not worked on patentable work.)

Lipo claims the population never reached that high a peak and did not substantially decline until after outsiders came.<p>> <i>I can&#x27;t see any support for the idea that the island was doing fine until outsiders bought war, disease, and slavery. As far as I can see, the war, disease, and slavery period followed European contact, but the initial population decline from a peak of around 15,000 down to 2-3,000 happened before European contact.</i><p>Lipo says that the claim that the population followed that sort of trajectory was essentially an early <i>rough guess</i> not based on actual data. A popular one, so you might find it in multiple sources, but a guess nonetheless. In response, quoting from that last link I gave before:<p>> <i>Finally, Diamond ignores field research reporting dated domestic habitation sites (see Hunt and Lipo 2009 for discussion). When the habitations are plotted in fifty-year intervals, the number of those occupied clearly shows that the first and only sustained decline, as a relative measure of the population, began only in the first interval following European contact.  Before contact the data show a population that is growing and stabilizing, as reflected in their habitations across the landscape.  There is no evidence of population decline, let alone “collapse” until after European contact.  Indeed, there is direct, abundant evidence that population numbers grew, stabilized, and then fell only after European contact beginning in 1722.</i><p>(source: <a href=""http://www.evobeach.com/2011/10/diamond-attempts-to-defend-myths-of.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.evobeach.com/2011/10/diamond-attempts-to-defend-m...</a> )<p>> <i>Even if it was external, though, why is &quot;land which isn&#x27;t being overrun by invaders&quot; different from any other resource?</i><p>That story would lead to a very different conclusion, especially if you want to turn the story into an analogy for how we should treat the earth as a whole.

Thou shalt only keep the \n     specific data I tell you to keep, and destroy \n     everything else related to my requests. At a later \n     point in time, I reserve the right to become \n     irrationally angry about your having kept the *some* of\n     the data I told you to keep, because, technically \n     speaking, the DO-NOT-TRACK header is all encompassing, \n     and supercedes all other instructions. I also reserve \n     the right to get angry if *your* system does not \n     perform according to *my* expectations, whatever those \n     expectations may be, at any particular time.\n\n  E.

Worse yet, the fact that a user may have cookies turned on, and has sent the request in plain text, across ten other systems beyond my own control (all of which should also respect the user&#x27;s wishes) completely defeats any realistic expectations of non-disclosure.<p>An honor system is certainly an admirable aspiration, but sending &quot;do not track&quot; requests by default also creates a general atmosphere of noise from users who may or may not be cognizant of the true nature of their actions.<p>The knee-jerk idea that cookies are bad isn&#x27;t good enough.

It may be of interest because our experience seems somewhat different to the home users posting here, in that:<p>1. It has &#x27;just worked&#x27; for over a year without maintenance and with little downtime. Note that the name and styling of the machine seem meant to be reminiscent of inkjet printers, which for all their faults tend to be &#x27;plug and play&#x27;: the 3D printer has lived up to that. We have used consumables as directed in the manuals, disposing of the print beds after each use.<p>2. 3D CAD software (Autodesk Inventor) is already in use and there are plenty of people very comfortable using it, so the design is a breeze. I&#x27;m curious how people are managing since CAD is expensive and there aren&#x27;t many open-source options. Once the parts are designed they are exported as STEP files, brought into HP&#x27;s print layout software and the print bed arrangement is set out manually by dragging-and-dropping.<p>The printer has mainly been used for promotional goods and, after an initial flush of enthusiasm, not much for general prototyping. My prediction that an actual product would be sent out within the year with 3D-printed parts in it proved false. There were some cool attempts to 3D-print moulds for dispensing plastics into, which is vastly quicker than using the services of a toolmaker, but sadly the surface finish was unacceptably poor due to the printing being in layers.<p>To summarise, the low-end professional market seems to be fulfilling the promise that 3D printing can be accessible (to companies where it isn&#x27;t their core expertise), but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be causing a revolution yet.",1398992763

7683604,comment,7679431,7683154,8,0,tptacek,,,"We&#x27;re an office culture. We&#x27;re constantly getting into situations where we hit technical challenges we haven&#x27;t solved before, but someone else in the office has. Several times a day you&#x27;ll see people crowd around someone&#x27;s computer trying to work through some bug or misbehavior to see if we can, as a group, turn it into something exploitable. That&#x27;s reason #1.<p>Reason #2 is fairness. Some of our work is on-site. We arrange our offices so that we have &quot;house accounts&quot; in Chicago, NYC, and SFBA, and on any given day some fraction of the office is likely to be at one of those places. All things being equal, people would like to work from their own office instead of someone else&#x27;s. If we pick up remote people, those people will by definition not be able to staff on-site projects, which mean that the people who actually come to the office will get stuck with that work.<p>Reason #3 is that reasons #1 and #2 have been dispositive for us since 2005, and so we have a management structure tuned to that office culture. We&#x27;re not set up to manage remote team members. We&#x27;re especially concerned about this because some of us have experience working on assessment teams at &quot;work from home&quot; firms, and have seen wildly uneven results from projects managed like that. We&#x27;re paranoid about quality and consistency the way a fine dining restaurant is paranoid about the consistency of dishes coming out of the kitchen.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that there&#x27;s necessarily anything bad about remote/WFH cultures, or that you couldn&#x27;t build a good assessment firm doing remote/WFH. I&#x27;m just saying we haven&#x27;t done it. :)",1398992570

Saying something like &quot;you should acquaint yourself with the idea&quot; forces me to either respond &quot;I was in fact already familiar with the idea&quot; or keep silent and let you make presuppositions about what I don&#x27;t know.  The former makes for boring reading; the latter is unfair.<p>And to the other commenter who has accused me of lacking perspective and being disrespectful: it must be nice having enough money where you&#x27;re not forced to choose between accepting a contract that strips you of your right to work on what you want in your own free time, or letting your cat die from cancer you can&#x27;t pay to treat.  If that&#x27;s not some form of slavery, then apparently I do lack perspective.  (If there&#x27;s some confusion as to how this relates to the original topic, it&#x27;s because the exact same form of law is being applied in both cases: it&#x27;s considered normal and fair for companies to offer contracts that default to stripping programmers of their right to work on what they want in their free time, and it&#x27;s up to programmers to be extremely careful not to accidentally sign something that does so.  Apparently even Carmack isn&#x27;t free from this, and that&#x27;s what prompted my original comment.)<p>As for the argument, I should choose to bow out rather than write a lengthy expansion of my thoughts, as this is the wrong subthread for it.  Maybe I&#x27;ll post a toplevel comment later if there&#x27;s sufficient interest, but there are probably more important topics to discuss.",1398992557

7683598,comment,7682609,7683096,7,0,Patrick_Devine,,,"In the aviation world it&#x27;s really mixed.  ICAO uses imperial and metric measurements for different things.  Feet are used for altitude and knots for distance, but temperature is always measured in centigrade.<p>It&#x27;s convenient to use feet because planes are stacked in 500&#x27; increments and not 152.4m increments.  VFR (visual flight rules) flights are usually on the 500&#x27;s (eg. 3500&#x27;, 4500&#x27;, etc. depending on heading) whereas IFR (instrument flight rules) flights are on the 000&#x27;s (4000&#x27;, 5000&#x27;, etc.).<p>Knots are convenient because 1 knot is equal to 1 minute of 1 degree of arc on a great circle.  If you&#x27;re flying anywhere far away this ends up being important as a great circle is the shortest route between any two places.<p>Oddly enough, the metric system is useful with temperature because the standard lapse rate is 2 degrees per 1000&#x27; of altitude.  So if you had to climb from 6000&#x27; to 8000&#x27; on an IFR flight plan, you would usually drop 4 degrees centigrade, which might be significant if it was raining out and it dropped below freezing.  Having water on your wings and climbing up to an altitude where it&#x27;s freezing is going to make you have a really bad day.",1398992502
