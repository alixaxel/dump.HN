7800267,comment,7796736,7796829,1,0,tdondich,,,"Hey there!  Answered on our blog, but also wanted to post our response here as well:<p>Hi Matt! Great question. There was prototype code in both GO and Node.JS. The code written in GO was not fully tested in a &quot;production&quot; environment because we made our decision on quite a few factors early on.<p>GO is fantastic as faster development cycles and performing CPU-bound operations. However, there are places where GO just isn&#x27;t the right choice for this particular scenario.<p>We use GO in various parts of our infrastructure where the piece is small and meant to process lots of information. However, provisioning zones is not so much a CPU-bound operation but an external operation bound operation. We have to wait for nginx to do various operations before control comes back to us. We&#x27;re not crunching numbers, we&#x27;re writing to the data storage for our provisioning information. This type of operation is further bound to external factors.<p>GO is also a language that doesn&#x27;t have massive adoptability yet. There&#x27;s a lot of 3rd party vendors where we use their technology and rely on their SDK&#x27;s to interact. Many of those vendors may not have written a GOlang library. Sure, there&#x27;s bindings to other languages; however, this is a small hoop to jump through. Is our provisioning dependent on such libraries right now? Not so much. However, you have to keep an eye on the long-term future.<p>We also isolate our backend systems at various levels and have them communicate via REST API&#x27;s. You can certainly write solutions in GO to have a REST frontend; however, it&#x27;s not the ideal case for GO, in our opinion. There&#x27;s a fair bit more scaffolding to put in place which means more code to maintain. There are some some great libraries out there for this (check out <a href=""https://github.com/ant0ine/go-.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ant0ine/go-..</a>. however, we have to compare the amount of code we need to write to support the environment we run in, versus the amount of code that focuses on the core problem we are trying to solve.<p>Also, it&#x27;s pretty difficult to find GO rock star engineers to hire. We have a couple amazing ones here in our team and we only hire the best. By the way, if you ARE A GO rock star, we want to talk to you. Reach out to me.<p>So, what we really wanted to find was a replacement language that is quick to develop, does well with asynchronous operations, which are external operations and I/O bound, and is easy to maintain with our existing engineering team as well as future members.<p>When deciding what platform or language to use to solve a customer facing problem, you sometimes can&#x27;t make the decision on numbers alone. In the end, node.js has the right balance of features to give us the ability to rapidly develop solutions that are I/O bound and has the support and maintainability to ensure we can keep developing the best customer solution possible for <i>this</i> specific use case.",1401119937

7800244,comment,7799820,7800156,5,0,mpweiher,,,"<i>Piketty&#x27;s numbers appear incorrect</i><p>Er...<i>some</i> of his numbers appear incorrect.  From this you incorrectly assume that this invalidates the conclusion.  It <i>may</i> invalidate the conclusion if the errors are significant.  However, what little I&#x27;ve seen so far does not seem to be all that significant.<p>From the fine article:<p>&#x27;Scott Winship, an economist at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, and notable critic of Piketty&#x27;s analysis, said the FT&#x27;s allegations weren&#x27;t &quot;significant for the fundamental question of whether Piketty&#x27;s thesis is right or not&quot;.&#x27;<p>So there seem to be highly qualified sources that say that the differences are not significant.  That&#x27;s not the same as &quot;he said/she said&quot;.<p>Do you have any evidence that the errors are significant?<p>You also blatantly mischaracterize Krugman&#x27;s point:  he showed that inequality in <i>capital income</i> is going up, not (just) general income.  Capital income has this property that it usually derives from capital (as the name says).  So unless there is evidence that the top 1% or so systematically get significantly better returns on the same capital, an increase in capital income let&#x27;s us include that there is an increase in base capital from which to derive that income.<p>On the other side of the coin, income leads to wealth, and unless you have evidence that high-income people save less of their income than lower-income people, then wealth will diverge.  All the evidence I have seen so far (and common sense) say that it is the other way around:  consumption saturates, so people with higher incomes actually save more and spend less, at least in relative terms.<p>So both sides of this equation quite trivially show the link between income inequality (especially for, but not limited to capital income) that you deny.<p>So both the FT criticism (= nit-picking in non-substantive details) and your criticism are unfounded, as far as we can tell.<p>Again, if you have some actual substantive evidence that the errors are significant, I&#x27;d love to see it.",1401119695

That was cited (although not generally named) in numerous FT and Economist editorials and opinion pieces over the years yet as far as I&#x27;m aware they have not published anything about the recent correction. It was used as the basis for serious national and international policy and has contaminated many subsequent studies in the field. For years the author made regular appearances pushing the importance of the finding in western media. Yet even a fairly basic review of the paper would have spotted some of the errors (it was a meta-analysis and some of the values from other paper were copied incorrectly or had the sign reversed) i.e. even an FT intern could have spotted the mistakes. Updates to the paper indicate that the entire result was based on fitting a curve to a single outlier (a study by the same author) and additional studies since 2009 give a very different picture when included.<p>As far as I&#x27;m aware Piketty&#x27;s work has had little to no real world impact as yet to government policy or widespread public opinion (I might be wrong of course). Any errors it contained, while worth correcting, don&#x27;t seem like they would have an earth shattering impact worthy of front page exposure and double page spreads while retractions in more influential studies go unreported.<p>[1] More about that here: <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/23/the-gremlins-did-it-iffy-curve-fit-drives-strong-policy-conclusions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2015/05/2...</a> and <a href=""http://andthentheresphysics.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/tols-corrections/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://andthentheresphysics.wordpress.com/2014/05/05/tols-co...</a>",1401118493

7800011,comment,7799323,7799572,2,0,kerkeslager,,,"Yeah, why not? What problem is an ORM actually solving in that case?<p>Yes, an ORM saves you the time of writing out the code to map the fields on the row to the fields on the object. But it doesn&#x27;t do that for free. Let&#x27;s say the results of your query are, shortly thereafter, looped over and one property is checked. Well, in NHibernate, that property is lazy-loaded by default, so now that you&#x27;re touching it, it generates an individual select query for every element in the list. That&#x27;s simple enough to fix: change that property to not be lazily loaded. Now suddenly a completely different part of the system is getting an OutOfMemoryException because you&#x27;re querying over an unfiltered dataset and now it&#x27;s loading a huge table into memory.<p>Your trivial query in SQL is not a trivial query in an ORM. Let&#x27;s keep trivial problems trivial.<p>There are tools that do this better, by essentially providing a domain-specific language that generates SQL queries (LINQ-to-SQL, <i>parts</i> of sqlalchemy, and, it looks like, PonyORM). These certainly result in more aesthetically pleasing code, but you&#x27;re still essentially writing SQL, except that you don&#x27;t have access to the entire SQL implementation. You want to remove constraints, apply an update, and then add the constraints back? Good luck doing that with anything other than SQL. This probably won&#x27;t hurt you for trivial queries, but having the ORM in your code means that it&#x27;s only a matter of time before someone on your team starts doing something non-trivial with it, and then the beast will raise its ugly head. And besides, while you can be careful with these DSL-style ORMs and they won&#x27;t hurt you, they won&#x27;t help you that much either. Typing a little more isn&#x27;t the bottleneck.",1401116883
