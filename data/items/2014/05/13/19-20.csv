For example, cars with more internal components are not actually more difficult to DRIVE than simpler cars (eg: carburetor vs fuel injection).<p>Likewise, people don&#x27;t pay by the character.  They pay by the word.  They also pay by the concept, so having N different ways to do something simple can be a higher cognitive burden than just 1 way.  (hence python vs perl).<p>Now, I believe that clear code, &quot;well designed&quot; code (despite the fact that its patently obvious that no one agrees on what well designed actually MEANS) are better.  Good abstractions.<p>But these are a function of the programmer from which they come from.  The programming language makes a difference but I&#x27;m starting to suspect beyond a certain point of feature completeness, you are hitting diminishing returns then negative returns.  Yes Java8 has Lambdas, that helps a lot.  But would Java9 benefit from implicit parameters?  Or from nearly any punctuation being an operator that can be overridden?  I argue these 2 features of scala, which people love for their ability to build concise, hard to read, harder to write, DSLs are part of the problem.<p>Ok enough ranting.  My parting shot is I write a 25,000 lines of scala into a production system.  We had to rewrite ALL the for loops into while loops.  In the end, I&#x27;d say Scala was generally helpful but not so much that I&#x27;d do it again.",1400011116

I lecture myself (though seldom for more than fifteen minutes at a stretch and then seldom when written substitutes are available). I believe there are circumstances when a well structured, well paced, varied, lively lecture can be the most efficient teaching method. But I do believe there is far more lecturing going on than can reasonably be justified by the evidence concerning the efficiency of lectures, especially bearing in mind the nature of the educational goals we claim to be striving for. I believe this state of affairs to be largely due to ignorance, attitudes, and institutional constraints, rather than to any inherent virtues of lecturing which I have overlooked, and which everyone else is privy to. I believe both institutions and validating bodies ought to be asking serious questions about courses which appear to be based primarily on lecturing as the dominant teaching method.&quot;</i>",1400010753

I think the interest of Redis is that it has many other features than simply put/get, and all those sorts, diff, etc typically would work a set of data that is being written in.<p>For sure having multiple instances will help some of this, but adds more complexity. Do you have your app write to multiple instances, and then read low latency from one, and read high latency from another?  Is that data now consistent? Do you setup Redis replication and make sure that works right and then read from different replicas?  Or perhaps you engineer some queue that does not block writes, groups them together and writes to Redis in a separate thread. Then you have to maintain all this and make sure it&#x27;s correct, back it up, what are the corner cases, failure modes,  etc.<p>From my experience, if you want to engineer things well, you end up essentially building out the same sub systems that a larger db engine has.

Just some of the ways I&#x27;ve used Moves that are outside of what I ever intended it for:<p>- Can I make this bus? How long did it take me to walk from the doctors office last time?\n- I dropped my keys while walking the dog. I sent my wife a screenshot of my route and she walked it and found it. \n- Where did we park the car?\n- Do we have time to brunch? Looks like over the last few weeks we spend about 30-40 mins at that restaurant each time.<p>Plus, moves has definitely contributed to my exercise routine by forcing me to reckon exactly with what I accomplished. Now, I consider myself a very fit, very active person. If I was actually trying to lose weight and had specific fitness goals I would <i>love</i> the unbiased data this gives me.<p>My wife and I both use it. There are 2 big things I wish I could change:<p>1. SHOW ME TOTAL CALORIES GODDAMNIT. I&#x27;m so sick of adding up the bubbles. I usually hit 4-5k calories a week. The fact that I know that indicates how many times I&#x27;ve added up bubbles in my head.<p>2. For all the non-tracked activities, please let me enter a calorie count and not just a duration. If I spend 45 mins on the elliptical at high resistance, the computer will tell me I burned maybe 700 calories. If I enter 45 mins of elliptical into Moves it defaults to like 250 or whatever. This IS based on my body weight, height, etc, but it&#x27;s an imperfect measure. So I have to lie and tell moves I did 120 mins or whatever to get as close as I can to the actual calories as measured by the machine.<p>Also, may I add one final comment: \nI wish all of the privacy-wonk types would just avert their gaze from Moves. We get it. You don&#x27;t like Facebook. You don&#x27;t like being tracked. You think I&#x27;m a fool for loving it. But THIS IS A TRACKER. That&#x27;s what it does.

It doesn&#x27;t take white culture to fix &#x27;ghetto people&#x27;. It takes hope, opportunity, community investment and old fashioned work from those people living there. Without it, all you&#x27;ll do is drain the youth from these communities, and allow real estate brokers access to swaths of uninhabited city centers.<p>Your argument is fundamentally wrong, and is incredibly ignorant of education and community development in failing areas.

How can an electric car that plugs into that electricity help?<p>EM: Right. There&#x27;s two elements to that answer. One is that, even if you take the same source fuel and produce power at the power plant and use it to charge electric cars, you&#x27;re still better off. So if you take, say, natural gas, which is the most prevalent hydrocarbon source fuel, if you burn that in a modern General Electric natural gas turbine, you&#x27;ll get about 60 percent efficiency. If you put that same fuel in an internal combustion engine car, you get about 20 percent efficiency. And the reason is, in the stationary power plant, you can afford to have something that weighs a lot more, is voluminous, and you can take the waste heat and run a steam turbine and generate a secondary power source. So in effect, even after you&#x27;ve taken transmission loss into account and everything, even using the same source fuel, you&#x27;re at least twice as better off charging an electric car, then burning it at the power plant.</i><p>Url: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_mind_behind_tesla_spacex_solarcity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_mind_behind_tesla_spa...</a>",1400009404

Angular doesn&#x27;t produce Web Components, has far too many complex concepts IMO (like the $scope.$apply example), and so far has rejected a Web Components centric approach (see their 2.0 design docs). You have to create many directives in Angular because it doesn&#x27;t support standard 2-way data binding to properties out of the box: without directives you can only bind to attributes. Polymer, for instance, doesn&#x27;t have those problems, and very complex widgets are built with templates.<p>And the complaint about needing JavaScript to configure Web Components seems to be completely without merit. Web Components imported with HTML imports are fully capable of registering themselves, so the import is all you need. Yes there&#x27;s some JS under the hood, but you don&#x27;t see it, and all of &quot;Bloop&quot; is JS anyway, so I&#x27;m really lost on this point.<p>React may be great, but the future is exactly in encapsulating away the work of building custom elements so that an application can be built of elements sourced from different vendors using whatever tools they want to implement them. I would have no problem using custom elements built with React, but at this point I am not interested in components that force me to use a particular framework. Trying to proclaim that all apps should be built with <i>this</i> or <i>that</i> awesome framework, is a quickly aging point of view.",1400009176

When the file size is too large, Git fails badly. Git works well for text files, not binary files.<p>Many designers who do not code at all do not understand the workflow of Git. The process of pull, commit, push is extremely confusing. E.g. One large company that forces all designers to use Git ended up with multiple files with slightly different names in the repo system. Designers do not understand the concept of merge conflict and will just rename the file so that they can push to the repo. Case in point: the mental model of Git has worked well for developers, but does not translate well to non-coders.<p>Overall, I think a version control system for designers should be transparent, non-intrusive, and just works. Designers should not have to worry about when to push or pull, should not have to worry when to commit. I think it should just backup every saves and then subsequently allow them to flag specific design iterations that they want to highlight.<p>Disclaimer: I am co-founder of Pixelapse - Version Control for Designers.",1400009092

Imagine you lived in a ghetto with your kid, and there&#x27;s a billionaire who proposes to offer him a good education, wouldn&#x27;t you want your kid to get out of that place ASAP.<p>The most probable outcome for a child who grew up in a ghetto isn&#x27;t that bright, and refusing to acknowledge the benefit of the above plans just for the sake of political correctness and free choice isn&#x27;t<p>>What makes your upbringing better than &#x27;ghetto people&#x27;?<p>Everything.

Do you see how easy it is to slip between the two?\n}<p>The line is so thick, it&#x27;s not even funny. It&#x27;s not cultural indoctrination, these are facts. There&#x27;s a reason why ghettos suck, and why no one in his right mind would make a conscious choice of living there. Let alone with a kid.<p>{\nWhat you&#x27;re operating under is called cultural relativism. Melville Herskovits said it best, &quot;Judgements are based on experience, and experience is interpreted by each individual in terms of his own enculturation.&quot;\n}<p>Oh really, where did he live? And where did his children grow up and study? I bet he didn&#x27;t send them to a slum just to be philosophical.<p>Try telling this to people living in those places. Anyone who says he lives there and is &quot;proud&quot; is full of shit. The minute they make it, they get out there. Only mobsters choose to keep living there because they&#x27;d be a nobody if they ever left.<p>Ghettos suck. This sentence would get an &quot;Amen&quot; from China to South Africa, and it doesn&#x27;t even need to be translated.<p>>In other words, while you may believe that a &#x27;ghetto&#x27; upbringing is worse than what you had, you came to that conclusion under a >biased observation.<p>Biased by numbers, yes. Criminality, illiteracy rate, rate of single moms, murder, poverty, health. Ghettos suck. If they didn&#x27;t, we&#x27;d have no problems actively making a choice of moving there with our families. But we don&#x27;t. Nobody who can afford to live elsewhere makes an active decision to live in a ghetto.<p>>Yes, there is a higher crime rate in &#x27;ghetto&#x27; areas, but that has less to do with culture, and more to do with opportunity.<p>Isn&#x27;t opportunity closely tied with culture?<p>How many startups have been started by a guy named Maleeek (with 3 &#x27;e&#x27; s) who grew up in a ghetto? If not none, then very few. Why? Because they didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to drop out of MIT, Harvard, or Stanford or to get there in the first place for that matter.<p>Yeah, there are few people who &quot;hustle&quot;.

For safety reasons, in many places you have to get out of the vehicle while it is being refuelled (the cylinder gets really hot!). And that is a change from your 50+ years driving habit. It also takes longer than a comparable gas pump (even if it is measured in single digit minutes). The gas gauge also reads differently (my guess is due to pressure decreases as gas is consumed).<p>In India, people convert their gasoline based cars to use gas cylinders.

7739966,comment,7738513,7739757,2,0,malyk,,,"Here are some constraints that I can come up with in a minute of thinking.<p>1.) Land costs.  If you are building inside a major city land costs are huge, and you need acres of land.  Outside of cities can be less expensive, but it&#x27;s still a steep cost.<p>2.) Permitting/regulations/etc. I have no idea what it would cost to get the land you just built zoned to allow you to build a school, but I&#x27;m sure it isn&#x27;t cheap or easy.<p>3.) Infrastructure costs.  You have to build each of these new schools.  The private boarding school that I went to[1] just built two new dorms after receiving a gift of $10m to house 98 students.  They are probably really nice dorms, but it&#x27;s not cheap to build. And that&#x27;s just the dorms.  You also need an academic center, library, gym, and possibly support buildings (like faculty housing, student centers, etc.).  You also need to build roads, sewers, electricity, etc.<p>4.) You need to find and hire administrators and teachers.  If you go with the chicago stats cited above then you&#x27;ll need to pay each teacher ~$70k.  One of the best things about private schools is the high teacher to student ratio. My biggest class was 14 students and most were in the 6-8 range.  It&#x27;s complicated to figure out the exact number of faculty off the top of my head, but you&#x27;ll need at least 10 teachers. My high school had around 380 students and they have more than 60 faculty.  So, for 100ish students you&#x27;d need 15ish faculty. That&#x27;s $1m a year in funding.  Chicago spends roughly $12k per student, which would cover faculty costs, but...<p>5.) You also have to pay administrators, janitors, lawn care, and a ton of other providers for service.  Chicago administrators make roughly $120k a year.  That difference has to come from somewhere.<p>6.) Oh, and you have to get accredited somehow so your students would be able to get into college.<p>There&#x27;s probably plenty more constraints that we could come up with.  But the biggest one is cost.  Who is paying for this?  A billionaire could do it, for sure. But it doesn&#x27;t seem like people are upset enough about the current situation to pay more taxes to support the schools we do have.  I&#x27;m not sure how you could convince people to pay to create a private school from scratch...especially if their kids aren&#x27;t going to be the ones eligible to go.<p>[1] Westminster School, Simsbury Connecticut - Amazing experience!\n[2] <a href=""http://chicagoist.com/2013/06/19/crains_chicago_business_and_how_to.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chicagoist.com/2013/06/19/crains_chicago_business_and...</a>",1400007773

When they were in a similar position to many of these SaaS companies we are discussing, their license fee and customer acquisition cost were enormous. That automatically self-selected their customers to be large enterprises, who they were completely dependent on. The initial license fee is such a large proportion of LTV compared to maintenance fees. With SaaS, companies are banking on scalability, personalization (multitenancy), and less sources of friction. Establishing a successful SaaS company allows them to realistically chase the long-tail of SMB that single-license companies cannot scale to do effectively.",1400007726
