7795024,comment,7794505,7794974,1,0,Zigurd,,,"Android apps that use an action bar no longer use an option menu button, which, in earlier Android versions, looked like a &quot;hamburger button.&quot;<p>They might still have an overflow pop-up for commands that don&#x27;t fit in the action bar. That&#x27;s shown as three stacked dots. That depends on screen geometry and how the app has configured the action bar. Apps can avoid having an overflow pop-up and use, for example, a split action bar instead.<p>The article&#x27;s main complaint isn&#x27;t about the hamburger button per se, but the fact that it often pops out what in Android parlance is called a &quot;navigation drawer.&quot; That&#x27;s what&#x27;s bad. And Google is pushing that idea as a replacement for a &quot;dashboard&quot; screen which was even worse, and is now deprecated as an official design idiom. But, as the article points out, a navigation drawer is just as much a nowhere-land as a &quot;dashboard.&quot; Avoid it.<p>The article advocates a tab bar as an alternative. On Android, you have the choice of Tab objects that would show different Fragment objects, or a split menu bar. But, better still would be to make navigation an organic part of selection within the app. This has the added advantage on Android of not requiring different tab bar behavior on multi-Fragment layouts.<p>Some Android apps might have a hamburger menu leading to a navigation drawer, but that is probably due to iOS port-itis, not a deliberate idiom using Android UI elements.",1400979341

7795020,comment,7794505,7794505,10,0,Spittie,,,"I&#x27;ve never understood the hate for the &quot;Hamburger button&quot;. It&#x27;s here, it works fine and doesn&#x27;t hurt anyone.<p>Some options just don&#x27;t need to be in the face of the user 100% of the time. Why do I need a &quot;setting/more&quot; button at the bottom of the screen all the time?<p>I can understand, it&#x27;s often overused. Some applications would be better by using &quot;tabs&quot;, some would be better by just placing the most-used buttons somewhere in the screen when you can always watch them. But why not doing both? Put your most-used features in an easy and discoverable position, hide stuff that the normal user don&#x27;t need often in the hamburger button (A good example for that is the Play Store, the slide menu has a link to settings, an about, and the user picker to switch user).<p>Also, the proposed solution is to have an auto-hiding tab bar. Please, please, think twice before implementing this. It&#x27;s really annoying to have something popping up and disappearing when I&#x27;m interacting with your applications, and not with your menu.<p>The Hamburger button has the advantage of staying to his place until the user decide to interact with it. This kind of tab bar instead is almost random. The user has to scroll up/down to show/hide it, which one already do when interacting with the applications. Also every applications seems to do it slightly different, so pulling up half of the screen might be enough in one, but not enough to show it in a different one.<p>So, the hamburger button might be horrible, but the tab bar is worse, at least in my opinion. The user interact with it more just because it&#x27;s getting more annoyed by it.<p>As an additional note, see the recent Google+ for Android redesign, which removed the hamburger button. Now it has two bar at the top of the screen which disappear/appear while scrolling, occupying almost 1/5 of the whole screen. Plus a &quot;+&quot; button hovering the content all the time. The general consensus (at least, the one I&#x27;ve heard) is that it&#x27;s a terrible upgrade.",1400979286

7795018,comment,7794505,7794890,2,0,neumann,,,">For me, the biggest issue I see with the example hamburger buttons there is that they don&#x27;t look like buttons --- they look more like an air vent/grille, a stylistic thing rather than &quot;touch here to get more&quot;.<p>Agreed, but if the trend continues eventually it will become known as the menu. It took my way to long to figure out what the hamburger did across all the apps and devices. I really disklike it in firefox and chrome on desktop, it seem unwarranted, but I guess firefox&#x27;s change is just conforming to what the designers see as a common icon set.<p>I see two issues with menu / option icons.<p>1. There is no universal icon. There is the &#x27;up&#x27; arrow on some IOS and android apps, the &#x27;...&#x27; on android, and now the hamburger. The fact that the hamburger doesn&#x27;t look like a button will become irrelevant once the general user associates it with a menu. I personally don&#x27;t like it either, but all I really want is consistency.<p>2. Related to this consistency, the hamburger button doesn&#x27;t always perform the expected function. Both of these are UX issues that cannot be easily standardised. It really is noticeable when it &#x27;breaks&#x27; the flow of the application by changing the state of the main window instead of offering a menu. I can&#x27;t recall which apps I use do this, but I remember being frustrated, much like the abuse of the back button on android (I think google play breaks this on the My Apps sections).",1400979278
7795017,comment,7794505,7794889,2,0,qwerty_asdf,,,"Generally, the reasoning behind not using text on a button (or wherever) is related to internationalization and locales.<p>Nascent software projects usually don&#x27;t have the manpower or the budget to translate their user interfaces into multiple languages early in the game.<p>When tasked with coding a button labeled with text, many developers will simply hard-code the label onto the button, unless explicitly instructed to code the label as a reference to a separate resource of constants containing appropriate label strings.<p>This can be murder to re-develop, after the fact, when tasked with developing foreign language versions of the same software. You&#x27;ll find that a team of ten developers have implemented a hundred different button labels, ten different ways, and sprayed them in a thousand places across the whole code tree, leading to partial and inconsistent translations, that need to be tested and re-tested in painstaking and tedious incremental iterations, and then you still have to dive back in and fix bug reports after releasing the translated version because you missed a spot.<p>To side-step this pitfall, and anticipate the potential for internationalization, one tactic is to implement languageless icons that define the look and feel of the interface. The drawback, of course, being that all users are confused equally, regardless of their native tongue.",1400979266

I&#x27;m a developer now <i>because</i> I had a brain-numbing government employee job - I had developed an interest in programming as a young child, but it never went anywhere, and I&#x27;d largely forgotten about it.<p>Fast forward, I&#x27;m stuck in an underpaid overworked dead-end job which I&#x27;m resigned to because I have a wife and child to support, and I&#x27;m borrrrred. I then stumble across a website discussing how fun and accessible Python can be for newbies, and I give it a crack, and I&#x27;m hooked.<p>I get a new government job, better pay, less work, still boring. But the boredom at work gives me a huge amount of mental capacity for my learning at home. My sleep admittedly suffered because of my programming, but my work didn&#x27;t. In my downtime at work, I&#x27;d write programs. I spent a lot of time learning JS because it was available to me for hacking on in my locked down work environment.<p>After five years of government schlepping by day, and programming by night, I met a man who could overlook my lack of qualification and who would give me a chance to prove myself. And all that boredom finally paid off.<p>Now that I&#x27;m a developer, my work is so intellectually challenging and interesting that I could not replicate the same learning that I did in my duller days.

[1] I don&#x27;t expect that the analysis will let this group off lightly. Both the participants and commenters here have already pointed out basic mistakes that were made by the group.<p>This newspaper account lacks information important to understanding the incident, such as the temperature and forecast. Additionally, snow conditions could have been reported by checking with the Forest Service, the Appalachian Mountain Club, and the Mount Washington Observatory. Analysis of this incident in Appalachia Journal will likely include such details. Winter conditions in the White Mountains are highly variable from year to year and have a tremendous impact on the outcome of backcountry trips.<p>One thing that hasn&#x27;t been touched on either by the article or by the commenters—they were doing this as a ski trip. It doesn&#x27;t say what kind of boots they had, but cross country ski boots tend to have less insulation than winter mountaineering boots (often much less). While temperatures at nearby Whitefield airport weren&#x27;t bad during the daylight hours of the 16th, they went below zero (F) in the early hours of the 17th. [2]  There&#x27;s no way I&#x27;d want anyone in my group wearing lightly insulated cross country boots in below zero temperatures.<p>It is significant that the trail wasn&#x27;t broken out. That it took them nine hours to go from Stillwater Junction to the closed Franconia Brook campsite indicates that snow and trail conditions were terrible.<p>I think that both the article and commenters here overemphasize the value of GPS. The route is not difficult to follow. Most of their second day was spent following a watershed downstream. For this you need a GPS? Warm boots are far more useful (note that the article says that a GPS failed). There is no cell reception where they were, either. When (not &#x27;if&#x27;) the electronics fail will you be able to cope?<p>The most important thing that this group did right was to get themselves out under their own power. People who come from urban areas have an incredible temptation to dial 9-1-1 or push a magic &quot;rescue me&quot; button on a PLB device. There is no fleet of helicopters standing by to come get you.<p>So many people come to New Hampshire to hike or enjoy the outdoors that there are numerous incidents requiring rescue. This has stressed the budgets of the state and federal agencies involved and taxed the energy of the volunteer organizations. Some of the incidents are due to ignorance, negligence, or irresponsibility. People discount the danger to which they expose their rescuers, but meanwhile most of the NH SAR community is aware that volunteer Albert Dow was killed taking part in a search. [3]<p>New Hampshire started the hikeSafe program [4] due to the increase in the number of search and rescue incidents. It&#x27;s disappointing that this article didn&#x27;t interview any SAR personnel or people with winter hiking experience to highlight this group&#x27;s mistakes. Nor does it list any sources of backcounty education, such as the AMC New Hampshire Chapter&#x27;s Winter Workshops. [5] It&#x27;s typical for downcountry media to make heroes of participants and treat such incidents as adventures rather than discuss errors, and this article somewhat follows that pattern.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.outdoors.org/publications/appalachia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.outdoors.org/publications/appalachia/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KHIE/2014/2/17/DailyHistory.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wunderground.com/history/airport/KHIE/2014/2/17/D...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Herr#Early_life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugh_Herr#Early_life</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.hikesafe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hikesafe.com/</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://amc-nh.org/committee/excursions/index-winterworkshop.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amc-nh.org/committee/excursions/index-winterworkshop....</a>",1400978058

Automatically tracking people is an invasive technical improvement to this, and it&#x27;s deployed in some places, but again it doesn&#x27;t really require fares.<p>Trains of course <i>do</i> require additional staff to handle higher loads, as do all modes of transportation, but with trains the staff/passenger ratio is <i>ridiculously</i> low, and it gets lower as they are used more. Of course there&#x27;s a resource allocation problem there, but again, fares don&#x27;t seem to be very useful there, at least in the realm of local public transport.<p>Charging money <i>does</i> limit the ridership, which was GP&#x27;s point, and which is the opposite of what sensible minds would want, namely less cars on the roads. Vandalising trains carries with it much harsher penalties than free-riding, so I doubt fares are a very effective deterrent; you don&#x27;t need to pay a fare to spray a tunnel wall, just a disregard for the law and maybe your own safety.

I simply cannot lie very well, for example, not because I cannot lie, but because I have trouble facing myself when I do so. So I try not be too conscious about manipulation and persuasion. And yet I know that applying well-tested techniques is very effective.<p>If anyone here can point me to literature on this subject (I suppose it&#x27;s a matter of ethics), I&#x27;d greatly enjoy exploring that.",1400976280

There&#x27;s various ways of trying to score internet pedant points by fiddling around the <i>very</i> edges of that statement, but they&#x27;re not relevant to a casual question. Yes, there is somewhere where you can find a physical thing that we might call a &quot;one&quot; and a &quot;zero&quot;, even if it&#x27;s not quite the same exact 1 or 0 you might get in your CPU due to parity or forward error correction or whatever other crazy thing you may have.<p>I mention those fiddly details to get them out of the way so I can bring up the bare handful of devices that actually functioned on true, no-kidding ternary: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_computer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_computer</a> Per Knuth&#x27;s note in that article, as we continue to optimize the heck out of our silicon and as we start running out of ability to simply shrink, it&#x27;s not inconceivable that ternary computing could make a comeback in the future. It is often casually assumed in current sci-fi and such that binary is the true &quot;final&quot; base of the future, but ternary is not out of the running.<p>On that note, see also: <a href=""http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/issue.aspx?id=3268&y=0&no=&content=true&page=5&css=print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/issue.aspx?id=3268&y...</a><p>This would have next to no impact on anything else, though... in fact the first ternary computers would certainly simply run current programs, possibly recompiled and certainly at an efficiency penalty, but with no other end-user-visible effect.<p>(And let me warn you away from various speculations that ternary computers could somehow compute something binary computers can&#x27;t. Turing Completeness, along with frankly obvious common (programmer) sense, precludes that. We already never truly work with bits... if we want bits we actually have to go out of our way to extract them from things at least the size of bytes, if not larger. Arguably modern computers are already in many ways Base256, as it is effectively impossible to manipulate anything smaller than an octet, which also obviously encompasses anything Base3 can do.)",1400976066
