The keywords are then treated as special, and may be used against different backend stores or with different pieces of logic.<p>What this means is that a simple search has a single well-defined execution path... and simpler code is easier to check for attack vectors and to harden.<p>Advanced search introduces many execution paths, possibly facing different tech, and is likely to have multiplied the attack surface whilst making it hard for a developer to spot all of the attack vectors.<p>Other problems arise from this: If you pre-process the search terms to clean the input, it may be that a later step in your &quot;advanced&quot; query transforms the search terms in a way that makes an attack possible.<p>Basically: Keep It Simple Stupid rules when it comes to security and advanced search not implemented by someone mindful of security will probably knock big holes in whatever security you think you have.",1403611189

Find someone either in your org or out of your org that has the skills and career you would like to work towards and start talking to them.  If you hit it off you may have found someone who can help you through the bumpy parts of your career and help you plan your next steps.   Some people charge for this as career coaching and that can also have some value but it&#x27;s challenging to sort out the best ones.  Every place I&#x27;ve gone I&#x27;ve looked for a mentor to bounce ideas off of and generally double check my thinking and how I&#x27;m approaching problems and my career.  You can go to industry events and start reaching out or just look for people you admire and reach out and start a dialog.<p>I personally think the concept of apprenticeship is lacking in the technology industry and we loose out on what other older professions have with clearer career paths because of their established practices of guiding people though their careers.  That said I&#x27;ve seen it abused too so there always needs to be balance in these things.<p>I personally coach about five people (for free) in my current company and they come from all areas of the org not just my group.

7937139,comment,7936919,7937024,12,0,skrebbel,,,"Usability. I strongly disagree that Android has much of that, and I suspect that a great many Android users simply don&#x27;t know any better. Windows Phone really is <i>that</i> much better.<p>Rant: My first smartphone was a Lumia, and then when it broke i went to a Sony Xperia (with a rather clean Android 4.3 on it).<p>I never even realized how well-designed WP was until I went to Android. Examples:<p>- Operation. Nearly all of WP is easy to operate with just a thumb, single-handed. All important controls are either near the bottom or reachable by swiping. On Android, I have to reach to the top for all kinds of stuff. It&#x27;s simply, apparently, an Android design pattern to put a bar with buttons on the <i>top</i>, as far away from my hand as possible. This is plainly ridiculous. On WP, there&#x27;s a clear relationship between &quot;how important is this action&quot; and &quot;how close is it to the bottom&quot;. As it should be.<p>- Consistency. All well-designed WP apps work the same. Swipe left/right for different screens/tabs, touch the left-side of an item for select-boxes, operations on the bottom and more operations by selecting &quot;...&quot;. This is the same nearly everywhere, both for built-in apps and for most well-designed apps from the store.<p>- Cleanliness and clarity. The Xperia <i>forced</i> me to choose a home screen background picture, making it very difficult to read text and icons. I google-image-searched a &quot;black.png&quot; to work around this, but still, it&#x27;s cluttered by default, and you need to do work to clean it up. Similarly, most good apps are really clean and uncluttered. I get the info I want to see or manipulate, no bullshit bells and whistles.<p>- Quick. WP&#x27;s live tiles are a perfect middle ground for me between bloated Android widgets and app-icons-only like in iPhone. My homescreen only contains the stuff i do often, with bigger buttons for stuff i do more. All this, without cluttering the UI like doing something similar on Android would do (by hand-dragging around a combination of widgets and icons).<p>Needless to say, I went back to Windows Phone (anyone want to buy a Sony Xperia SP, btw?). Upgraded to WP 8.1, which added:<p>- The best mobile calendar app I&#x27;ve ever seen. The week view is simply amazing [1].<p>- Fix for <i>every single thing</i> I want that Android had and WP hadn&#x27;t: better volume controls, action center for notifications and quick access to settings, stuff like that.<p>I&#x27;m well aware that none of the above includes the things you mention: customizability, open source, etc. WP indeed doesn&#x27;t have that - it&#x27;s much more like iOS in that respect. I thought I&#x27;d miss this, but with 8.1 fixing all the issues I had with WP, I realize that actually I don&#x27;t want customizability, I want the thing to work great out of the box.<p>You only need customization if what you start with sucks.<p>On the hackability aspect though, WP app development is a <i>very</i> smooth experience compared to Android app dev (assuming you have a Windows computer ready somewhere). The API is very well designed and documented, and the tools are great (assuming you can stand Visual Studio).<p>[1] <a href=""http://conversations.nokia.com/2014/04/17/windows-phone-8-1-calendar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conversations.nokia.com/2014/04/17/windows-phone-8-1-...</a>",1403609909

But for a bad matric accounting teacher, who put me off the field, I would probably have opted to study financial accounting as well, with a view to becoming a CA. Also there is no denying that South African corporate governance is very good, in large part due to CAs.<p>However, you may be confusing correlation with causation.[^] South African CAs are good at business because they are intelligent -as you point out they need to complete 7 years of grueling accounting theory and practice-not necessarily because they have the CA(SA) credential. They&#x27;d probably do just as well academically if they studied mathematics, computer science, biology, statistics or engineering. It&#x27;s no coincidence that kids who are good at school mathematics are told to become chartered accountants in SA, since maths ability is a marker for intelligence. My main worry about accountants having a strong lobby, and accounting becoming the main route to megabucks in SA is that it devalues other professions and draws the brightest minds away from other fields - as you yourself point out ,a person with an undergraduate degree and an MBA is likely to make less money than a CA.

7937054,comment,7936701,7936992,2,0,s_baby,,,">Looking at dreams and out-of-body experiences is interesting to help answer your question.<p>Two points on this:<p>OOBE are a different class of experiences.  It&#x27;s a completely different state characterized by theta wave activity whereas mystical experiences are associated with delta and gamma waves.  Having a malleable sense of self and experiencing dream-like states aren&#x27;t equivalent phenomena.<p>People experience what is traditionally considered real(physical reality) and have naive interpretations of what that is(flat world, anthropomorphize animals, finite universe, etc...).  Same goes for any other state of consciousness.  An interesting counter example is shared hallucinations in such dream states.  If you and someone else experience the same phenomena within the same state it goes from a 1st person experience to a 3rd person experience.  That doesn&#x27;t mean the hallucination is there in a physical sense but at the same time the experience suggests and underlying &quot;realness&quot; to it.<p>>Dreams can seem just as real as real life so I&#x27;d speculate that there is nothing that happens in our brains that can&#x27;t be explained by our brains chemistry.<p>That&#x27;s my point.  Finding neural correlates doesn&#x27;t prove/disprove anything as both sides of the argument often like to believe.  The experience of the world is also just brain chemistry.  We only know the world through experience(and by association biochemistry) so it&#x27;s not a useful distinction.",1403608172
