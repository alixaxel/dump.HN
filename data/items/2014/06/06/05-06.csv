7856390,comment,7856302,7856372,18,0,bittermang,,,"Spoken like a person who has never so much as sniffed what the world is like in &quot;AAA Game Development&quot;.<p>Imagine what a product like Facebook or Mac OS would look like, if after every major release, 2/3rds or the entire team were laid off, and a fresh batch of bright eager young talent was put in the chairs at a cheaper wage than the last crop, unaware of the doom riding on the horizon.<p>Do you know why every EA franchise seems to tank over time, until it&#x27;s eventually killed? Because the people who made it originally are gone, replaced by a bunch of guys who are told &quot;Make it work like the last one, but the market says it needs to be more action-y, so do that too.&quot; The people on the new team weren&#x27;t there the first time around, and so they wind up making a faded copy of a game trying to imitate the predecessor. Eventually the game loses all of the heart, passion, and competency that made it a great game in the first place.<p>In the software world, we know the benefit of building a strong team. People learn to work with each other, and people learn to work with the product, knowing it inside and out. They&#x27;re able to make the product the best it can be. That doesn&#x27;t seem to matter in the world of games to publishers. They see the people who build the games as disposable fodder, because as you say there will always be a new generation whose greatest desire is to be a game developer.<p>Sure. Publishers don&#x27;t see layoffs as a problem. It&#x27;s become part of their business model by now. But from where I sit, you can only disenfranchise so many people, until you&#x27;ve killed your golden goose who makes building the product for you possible in the first place.<p>And this is directly why we&#x27;ve seen the rise of indie games. Every time they piss one of us off, we slowly start to realize we don&#x27;t need them anymore.<p>-- A laid of game developer, with a foreclosed home.",1402034357

7856383,comment,7853786,7855492,3,0,hft_throwaway,,,"I think it&#x27;s a bad idea for a restaurant. Auctions generally involve &quot;winner&#x27;s curse&quot; where the top bidder almost always overpays vs. fair value. Restaurants want to give customers a good experience to keep them coming back. Feeling like a sucker leads to buyer&#x27;s remorse. Getting a &quot;difficult&quot; reservation feels like a prize.<p>Sure Next tickets may be underpriced at times. I imagine the Trio menu will be a very hot ticket when it first comes out, but pricing so customers get a good value for the duration of the menu is a better long-term play. The guy who scores &quot;underpriced&quot; tickets will feel great about the experience, brag to his friends, and likely return.<p>Are people who paid $800 for a PS4 happy about their decision today?",1402034112

The fact is that large public universities generally have a broader charter than small, elite private schools.  This is a factor of how they&#x27;re governed on the one hand (things like mandating x% of students are admitted from in-state, or enforcing affirmative action), and the fact that they [usually] have to provide a reasonably comprehensive set of study options on the other.  I went to an &quot;elite&quot; state school and studied history & comparative religion.  My wife went to a small private women&#x27;s college (~750 students) and studied biology.  The resources available at my uni, which has a $2b/yr operating budget, were orders of magnitude better than hers, but the education I received was far less personal and -- again speaking in generalities -- not as good as what she received with the small class sizes and personal tutelage from her professors.",1402031788

Such distinctions have great social relevance everywhere.  Consider Latin Americans: Catholic vs Evangelical (and that in itself is already a ludicrous simplification) has massive post-colonial, political, and social ramifications; to lump them all as &quot;Christians&quot; is to throw away so much information.
