This girl was admitted under UT&#x27;s explicit policy of admitting unqualified students as long as they come from awful schools. That sort of thing can cause quite a large gap between, say, the 25th percentile student and the modal student.<p>update: for reference:<p>UT Austin 25th-75th percentile SAT math scores: 590 - 710<p>Cal Tech 25th-75th percentile SAT math scores: 770 - 800<p>How significant do you think it is that a quarter of Cal Tech students are below the 25th percentile?

7856669,comment,7856302,7856539,3,0,ehurrell,,,"That does seem like it has a lot of potential to tackle this, though it would probably make game development less attractive (the illusion of a steady job is better than &#x27;well in 9 months you&#x27;ll be looking for work&#x27;). Game dev is hugely attractive of course, so it could conceivably take the hit.<p>One possible problem with this is what&#x27;s already been happening with contract CG people in the movie industry. Their work is becoming increasingly devalued so there&#x27;s a race to the bottom in terms of charging, such that situations like Ang Lee&#x27;s Life of Pi, where he said something to the effect that he felt he paid too much for CG (I can&#x27;t remember offhand the exact quote) and the CG people were barely making ends meet.

People can get by on more or less the same skill set they had 15 years ago, and once the movie has been shot, virtually nobody has gained any new knowledge.<p>The game industry has to considerably up their game (no pun intended) with every new release. The only way they can keep up the movie-style cycle if a company producing a new game can pick up developers just laid off by someone else.<p>I doubt if that is sustainable in the long run. At some point hiring new devs with very recent experience will become more expensive than retaining knowledge.<p>The game industry will always have more dramatic cycles because any company is as successful as their last game, but the current state of affairs just reeks of immaturity.",1402040939

Many of my peers are not just tech savvy, they&#x27;re also developers, designers, and entrepreneurs.

After all, Paul Graham has an entire book called _Hackers and Painters_, and he argues: &quot;Of all the different types of people I&#x27;ve known, hackers and painters are among the most alike.

The great thing about artificial sweeteners is that they are mostly not as sweet as real sugar and what&#x27;s most important to me, don&#x27;t leave the horrible sour after taste that simple carbs do.<p>These days most things people consider normal are too sweet for me.<p>As for sugar being evil. It is, for varying definitions of evil. Its biggest problem is that it&#x27;s just a lot of calories packed into a small volume, so you don&#x27;t realise how much you&#x27;ve eaten. Surprisingly, once you abolish sugar, it becomes difficult to fulfill your daily calorie needs. When strenuous exercise is involved it becomes downright impossible.<p>If you don&#x27;t care about calories, then surely you care about energy fluctuations. Foods high in sugar will give you an instant rush of energy that abates quickly. This leaves you hungry and sleepy, leading to a cycle of being hungry all the time even though you&#x27;ve eaten enough calories.<p>For instance, I read a study (that I can&#x27;t find a link to right now) showing that eating oatmeal for breakfast leaves you feeling full <i>hours</i> longer than eating regular cereal even when controlled for calorie intake.<p>PS: especially for the reasons of those energy spikes, I aim for a low glycemic index diet rather than just a no sugar diet.

You put a team together for a project, work the project, and let every one know up front that this is a temporary gig, not a permanent job. Like in the movie industry. But the twist is, you embrace a telecommuting model, allowing developers to move from project to project without having to move from house to house.<p>This would also make it much easier to rehire people who worked for you before, providing continuity to the games, and increasing level of code reuse. I know it&#x27;s not a steady job, but perhaps it&#x27;s a fair compromise. Also, this would allow the video game industry to keep older talent, as developers would be able to have a more flexible schedule and live in more family friendly suburban neighborhoods.<p>Just an idea....",1402038208

I had decided at that young age that I had spent so much time already playing games, that I should work toward that industry. I should give something back. I paint a bright picture because despite it all, I still have heart.<p>I pick on EA for their sequels specifically, because I can smell the stink on the disc. I&#x27;m a fan of Need for Speed. But I know I&#x27;m taking a gamble on each one I buy, because I don&#x27;t know what corners EA decided to cut this time. It&#x27;s not simply a case of the same thing being boring the second time around, the game is literally weaker than the predecessor. Skate is another example of an awesome game that shook up the skateboarding genre, and put Tony Hawk on the ropes. But sequels should improve in some way, not just better graphics, but better features, tighter gameplay. Skate and Need for Speed go backwards in their sequels. You can play the games side by side, and watch the gameplay get worse. Things that worked in the last game are now mysteriously broken, because the new dev team wasn&#x27;t there the first time around. They don&#x27;t understand or own the product in the way the original team did. By the time (if) they make it to the third game, it&#x27;s a copy of a copy.<p>Games can be a lot like television shows, in that they may have an over arching story that spans across the series. And much like a television show can lag in the ratings and get cancelled, games with a story to tell wind up never getting a proper ending. That is the case with Dead Space, a deeply engrossing world that just kinda... ends. No real resolutions to tie up the plot. As a fan, over time you may become worried to invest in EA titles, because you know they&#x27;re eventually going to be left to die, with no real ending. Why engross yourself in a world that you know is just going to disappear? Why watch a drama that is just going to end on a cliffhanger, and never get a 4th season to wrap it up? Would you read a book that just stopped in the middle of the page, paragraph, or sentence?",1402038164
7856536,comment,7856211,7856211,19,0,Evgeny,,,"What I personally found out was that if you stay away from sugar and sweeteners completely, eventually you get used to the new taste and no longer suffer from lack of sweetness. I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever be able to drink unsweetened coffee, but now I&#x27;m doing exactly that. More than that, things that had &quot;normal&quot; taste before (such as soft drinks) will now seem overly sweet, to the point of not being able to drink them at all.<p>So maybe instead of asking &quot;what is the best sugar replacement&quot; one should ask &quot;how do I best get used to not sweetening everything I eat&quot;.<p>(I understand that the article casts doubts on sugar being evil. I still think that reducing sugar and / or sweeteners as much as possible at the very least will not hurt you, and most likely will be a bit of a benefit).",1402038138

I tend to design small circuit components up front on paper with a good old fashioned calculator then simulate in LtSpice. It kills a lot of frustration and things you&#x27;ve forgotten about. However it doesn&#x27;t always work out as SPICE can&#x27;t deal with parasitic inductance and capacitance easily without adding primitives to the net. This kills you after a few MHz.<p>- The art of electronics is a terrible book IMHO if you want to learn electronics. Even as a reference its not great. It&#x27;s disjoint and poorly written. Better bet is the ARRL handbook even if you don&#x27;t do RF stuff. The material is wonderful in that book. Being American though, it is undergoing a transition to SI units though so its a little inconsistent in the maths with random multipliers here and there.<p>- nice to see something without a microcontroller in it and some manual work (coil winding).<p>I still wish all electronics was at this level.

When you break down the interests of companies this seems like just a product of economic self-interest, financial risk, volatility, and publisher/studio relationships.<p>But the truth is that the practices of industries are often based on what the employees are willing to take. Employees in the game industry will come back after being fired ... and fired again. They won&#x27;t quit their job even though they work 80+ hours a week for months on end. In other industries, this would never fly, and practices that assume you can do this to employees would have never caught on, because the employees in (many) other industries won&#x27;t as consistently take that abuse.<p>The practices of the gaming industry have, over the years, formed around this fact of nature about the employees.
