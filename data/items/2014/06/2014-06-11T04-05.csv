Here&#x27;s the excess for those interested.<p>--<p>My experience with functional languages is very limited. My university required one course that delved into both functional (Scheme) and logic (Prolog) languages along with context-free grammars through BNF. Because of the broad range of material, I can safely say that I did not take away much from the course (aside from an awareness of the subjects).<p>I&#x27;m coming from an academic computer engineering background of C and Verilog (embedded system development and software/hardware codesign) as well as an academic computer science background of Java. In my industry work, I&#x27;ve learned some Python, Ruby (Sinatra/Rails), and Javascript (both client-side and server-side through NodeJS).<p>I&#x27;m leaning towards Haskell simply because XMonad was written in it, meaning that I will finally understand my window manager&#x27;s configuration script. I&#x27;ve also considered Erlang because of how powerful I&#x27;ve heard it is with concurrency (and is one of the best for the actor model).",1402462021

What language do you recommend?<p>--<p>Having read several older articles (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2413816) and blog posts (http://japgolly.blogspot.com/2014/06/a-year-of-functional-programming.html), I&#x27;ve become more interested in attempting to learn - and I mean really learn - a functional language.<p>I&#x27;m having to learn Scala for work, but I don&#x27;t really care for how much setup I have to go through to get a project going. Maybe I&#x27;m doing things the wrong way, but first-time setup of sbt (downloading all of the jars) and frameworks like Play irritate me simply because I want to get up and running quickly. Managing dependencies and working with what feels like embedded Maven syntax does not exactly excite me, mostly because I am not too familiar with Maven itself.<p>I&#x27;m trying to avoid losing interest, which typically comes about from uninteresting &quot;Hello World&quot; examples and annoying toolchain setup (usually around JVM-based languages). I have seen some really amazing work done through the JVM, but I always see developers using either a) Eclipse or b) IntelliJ as their work environment to manage all of the project-related material.<p>Which leads me to my last bit of background... I&#x27;m a terminal vim guy. I really enjoyed using it when I was introduced to it in academia and continued to use it ever since. Because of this, I found myself using a more terminal-oriented environment: XMonad as my window manager, rxvt as my terminal, vim plugins like Ctrlp for quick navigation between material, etc.<p>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of smart people on this site and am hoping to poke you for advice. I&#x27;d love to be able to use what I learn at work and also pass on what I learn to others.",1402461974
