7838452,comment,7837947,7838223,7,0,slapshot,,,"This case is about a trademark, not a patent.  Any word or symbol that identifies a source of goods can be a trademark.  Hence Apple getting a trademark on using the word &quot;Apple&quot; to sell computers even though people have been using the word &quot;apple&quot; to refer to fruit for hundreds of years.  (The same goes for &quot;Amazon&quot; despite the river, &quot;Windows&quot; despite the ventilation system, and &quot;Beats&quot; despite the existence of rhythm).  If one tried to sell computer parts under the name &quot;Apple&quot; or any reasonable variant thereof, it wouldn&#x27;t be a defense to say &quot;look, there&#x27;s a fruit called the same thing.&quot;<p>The real problem here is that Zazzle caved in based on a weak letter about the trademark -- not that the trademark office somehow failed.  If Apple Inc sent a letter to Zazzle asking to remove all references to the word &quot;apple&quot; in Zazzle, the problem wouldn&#x27;t be that Apple&#x27;s trademark is invalid (it&#x27;s perfectly valid for selling computers), but rather that Apple would have stretched its trademark too far (it only grants the right to control uses related to selling computers).  Same here.  Somebody could quite reasonably sell computer products under the name &quot;Pi&quot; (see Raspberry Pi for example), but that wouldn&#x27;t grant the right to remove all references to the number from Zazzle.",1401777488

My team had done some work with a contractor, who was blind, to do QA around accessibility features and screen reader compatibility, his specialty. He came into town for an all-hands meeting, and after a brief orientation to the physical layout of the office, was perfectly self-sufficient and resourceful. Until one point a day or two into his visit when he called me over to his desk asking for help. He was rather frustrated because his screen reader had completely stopped talking to him, even though he could feel from the fans that it was still on.

7838437,comment,7837628,7837983,11,0,wtallis,,,"Essentially <i>none</i> of the unreliability of consumer SSDs is directly attributable to MLC flash cells wearing out. They&#x27;re large enough, have enough spare area, and the wear leveling <i>works</i>. When a consumer SATA SSD fails, it&#x27;s almost always a catastrophic failure of the controller or its firmware, and the rest of the failures are from things like losing an entire NAND package or some other critical component on the PCB.<p>Now, it can be said that the need for good wear leveling and latency hiding is what causes the controllers and their firmware to be so complex and thus failure-prone. But the myth of SSDs wearing out needs to die. When an SSD does wear out its write endurance, it&#x27;s a gradual process with lots of SMART warnings and a gradual decline in performance when the controller no longer has enough less slack space to work with, and some sporadic data corruption. It also doesn&#x27;t start happening until the drive has been subjected to a lot of heavy writing - it takes <i>months</i> of 24/7 torture testing: <a href=""http://techreport.com/review/26058/the-ssd-endurance-experiment-data-retention-after-600tb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techreport.com/review/26058/the-ssd-endurance-experim...</a>",1401777134
