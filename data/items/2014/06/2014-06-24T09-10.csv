I had been doing it on the side for 8  months... and it was a great experience so far. I had great clients and I absolutely loved working with them.<p>But things changed soon couple of weeks back when I happened to look for another contract where I could put in 20-25 hours weekly - I had that slot empty after leaving a job. I landed up one with a decent hourly rate.<p>Firstly, it was not a typical job that I took up earlier - it is a &quot;developer&quot; job and less of consulting. In the test assignment - which was supposed to take just couple of hours, I had spent 3-4 hours. Around 1 hour was setup time and a very small bit of learning was required on that task. I also mentioned that clearly to the client.<p>Now, my workdays with the client are miserable. This client has been pushing me on timelines - Example: I have 7 hours of work-slot spread in 3 alternate days and he would call me on the non-working hours. Additionally the expectations are too high - He says &quot;this is a one hour job&quot; - And it takes me 12 hours to finish that. I am confident it is not a 1 hour job and doesn&#x27;t look like 12 hours either - except that I was given something not supported directly and I had to tweak it up a lot.<p>How do you guys deal with such clients?<p>Is he a toxic client - that I should get away from ? Or is this just an early pain that I must endure for long term gain?<p>P.S: I took up this contract, quit it in just few days and took it up again 15 days later with lesser hours per week. I was frustrated with the work - but the reason for quitting earlier was unrelated.",1403603787

Fewer cycles allocated to the language, more cycles allocated to problem domain.<p>* The 95% case for associative and sequential containers is built into the language, with (for me) enormous benefits to programming efficiency.<p>* A streamlined and carefully orthogonalized standard library optimized for systems programming. Golang has the best-designed standard library I&#x27;ve ever used.<p>* A ruthlessly pragmatic packaging and modularity system; unlike C++, packaging is not left up to the build system.<p>* Build-world compilation times measured in 100s of milliseconds rather than 10s of minutes.<p>If I was writing, say, a generic trie library that I was hoping to get hundreds of different programmers to use, C++ would be a tempting target because of generics. But it turns out, most of the time I build projects like that, I&#x27;m really just wanking. Another benefit of Golang is that it&#x27;s so stripped down and pragmatic that it subtly discourages wanking.<p>A lot of people would add Golang&#x27;s concurrency model (share by communicating instead of communicating by sharing) and lightweight threads to this list. I like Golang concurrency too but my sense of it is that among languages designed from the jump for concurrency, this isn&#x27;t that much of a unique benefit.",1403603739

The Coefficient of Performance (heat moved/work done, higher COP is better) of an A/C is:<p>COP = T_hot / (T_hot - T_cold).<p>T_cold is the inside temp, T_hot is outside of the heat exchanger.  The narrow the temperature range, the better the COP.  Thus the A/C will actually be more efficient in terms of heat moved per watt while it&#x27;s cooling a warm house down than when it&#x27;s already cool.<p>There&#x27;s one other factor that applies.  The rate of heat transferring into the house is proportional to the temperature difference.  Once the house has warmed up, you reach equilibrium.  The net heat flow stops, so the total amount of energy you need to remove later stops rising.  If you run the A/C all the time, heat is transferring in all the time.  So the total amount of heat you need to move back outside in a day increases significantly if you leave the A/C on.",1403602350

I ended up moving the &quot;on&quot; times 30 minutes earlier and the &quot;off&quot; times an hour earlier.  We saved energy and had a more pleasant environment.<p>This was using dumb thermostat technology.  If we were back later than usual, the house still got warm.  If we stayed up later than normal, the house started to get chilly.  Smart thermostats that know what you&#x27;re doing can help even more, but the less predictable you are, the more the gains from the thermostat being linked to other systems to monitor what you&#x27;re doing.  If you&#x27;re home the same time every day and go to bed at the same time, the gains will be less.<p>BTW, I also discovered that our dishwasher warmed the kitchen by 2C.
