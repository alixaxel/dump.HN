The pain points are painful enough, and the differences in Rust are soothing enough, that people are willing to invest in Rust as a future replacement.<p>People don&#x27;t actively want a Ruby or Python replacement; they&#x27;re good enough for now. There isn&#x27;t much in Rust that a Ruby or Python programmer will look at and say &quot;that problem has caused me issues for years&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t offer enough over what they already have to invest in such a young language.<p>If Rust succeeds, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see it at least sitting alongside Ruby and Python, but by that point the ecosystem will have built up enough around it that you&#x27;re not losing so much by switching.",1403614658

7937396,comment,7935872,7936623,5,0,Loughla,,,"I agree that higher education administrative costs have gotten higher since the 90&#x27;s, BUT (and that&#x27;s a big but), as far as your $20 goes, there&#x27;s a reason you&#x27;ve been rung through the ringer. The institution didn&#x27;t do that to assert dominance over you. They did it to be in compliance with the law and audit requirements. No one wants to track down $20. They have to because of rules imposed on them from outside forces.<p>Institutions who receive public dollars are audited at least yearly to ensure compliance with state/provincial requirements, and somewhere around every 5 years on federal statute. These audits include ensuring checks and balances on money paid out to staff/students for any reason, including travel and conference costs (fun fact, many federal programs have travel costs that are based on staff pay, thereby limiting the amount of &#x27;excess&#x27; spending the programs can do on travel. . . .because everyone knows we attend conferences in Michigan for fun. . . ).<p>Anyway, it may seem like a small deal to you that you lost the receipt for $20, and in the grand scheme of life, it is. BUT, in the direct application of audit completion and legislative compliance, that $20 is the first step to lawsuits, persecution and public shaming of the University when it turns out that every employee was allowed to slip $20 past the business office. Controls are controls on everyone, they are impartial and they apply across the board; the same rules apply to the lowly grad. ass. as they do to the provost and president.<p>Is it senseless to have that much work and that many hours spent on on $20? Yes.\nIs it senseless to have that much work and that many hours spent to ensure that tax dollars are spent reasonably and within the bounds of the law?<p>No.<p>Source: I am part of those &#x27;sickening&#x27; higher education administrative costs, and I have personal experience consulting for federal audit compliance at public colleges in the states.",1403614615

Did you post this issue because you&#x27;re a Docker dev?  Something you wanted us to see, or just saving the link for posterity?<p>I think it looks like a flamewar, so for my benefit can you tell me what is the behavior: (I think I have it)<p>1) The docker index (public registry) lives at index.docker.io.  If you push an image like &quot;yebyen/foo&quot; then you need to log in as &quot;yebyen&quot; and you&#x27;re making yebyen/foo public.<p>2) The docker-registry project, when you deploy it, takes up port 8080 by default.  If you push an image like &quot;registry:8080/bar&quot; or &quot;my.registry/bar&quot; the dot or the colon are detected before the slash, which are not valid parts of a username on the public index, so you push to that registry (your registry, or your organization&#x27;s registry server ostensibly.)  These connections are unauthenticated.<p>Is that about the state of things?  Where is the confusion?",1403614342

That only worsened when I started job interviewing with accounting firms, including Arthur Andersen.<p>Why don&#x27;t you use your skill to develop a taxation system for which you can formally prove that you can&#x27;t do such sketchy tricks for tax avoidance? A kind of dual (in the sense of mathematical optimization) to accounting: If accounting is (among other things - of course) about finding dirty tricks in the taxation system for tax avoiding, co-accounting shall be about developing taxation systems where it shall be (formally provable) impossible to apply dirty tricks for tax avoidance.",1403613660

That number turns 30,000 accidents into 3,000 accidents, but that&#x27;s assuming all cars are self-driving.<p>2. It assumes that in those 3,000 accidents, the self-driving cars are &quot;at fault.&quot; But those last 10% of accidents are things in which driver error is not a factor.  If a cinderblock falls off a bridge onto my self-driving car, it would take an incredibly aggressive jury[1] to blame that on the car.<p>What is the cause of those last 10% of accidents?  Is it things like manufacturing faults, in which case the manufacturer is already absorbing the risk?  (And a computer-driven car could handle a blowout better than a human could.)<p>Oh, I found an NHTSA paper[2] that gives that &quot;90% due to human error&quot; figure, and puts 4 to 13% on &quot;vehicle factors (brake failure, tire problems, etc.).&quot;  So I think my point in the preceding paragraph holds: a big company is already on the line, the automatic car could do better health checks to prevent them, and it could have a better way of dealing with mechanical failure.<p>[1] Not that such a thing is impossible.<p>[2] <a href=""http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0B5GzBWLCrcJ:www.nhtsa.gov/people/injury/research/UDAshortrpt/UDAsummtechrept.pdf+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:0B5GzBW...</a>",1403613633

Inflation has pushed your stereotypical X-10 appliance module from $10 to currently $20.  I&#x27;ve been mostly Insteon for a decade or so now, but the venerable X-10 appliance module is a good canary as its been around for decades unchanged.  Anyway its off to the races with the new breed, hundreds of bucks for a mere thermostat, etc.  The days of your linux box turning your aquarium tank lights on and off in a cron job for $30 total are pretty much coming to an end, although it&#x27;ll still be possible, much slower and harder to automate and it&#x27;ll cost $750 and have a phone app that demands access to your contact list, but it&#x27;ll still sorta work.<p>Another interesting trend in home automation is abandonment of all legacy tech.  Ask someone what came before the arduino in microcontrollers, &quot;uh, nothing, they were the first ever&quot;.  Ditto the new wave of home automation, the zillionth competitor still positions themselves as the &quot;first&quot;.  Not too impressed with this trend either.  If I&#x27;m making fun of this marketing scheme, I&#x27;m probably not the only guy in the target market making fun of the trend.<p>A final interesting industry trend is the conspicuous consumption aspect.  Nobody seriously tried to claim an early 80s era X-10 wall wart was a designed thing of beauty to show off to your friends, any more than a circuit breaker or a gas shutoff valve.  The new wave is all about the bling as the highest priority.  Does look pretty nice.<p>So that&#x27;s the four trends I&#x27;ve seen in HA, your observation of extensive partnering agreements, the cost is exploding, every copycat is the first product ever, and appearance is the #1 priority.  None of the trends could have been extrapolated from the earliest days in the 80s to 2010 or so.<p>I suspect interoperability is NOT going to turn out any better for HA than it has for home stereo-TV-dvd-xbox remote controls, or kitchen appliances (try swapping egg beaters between competing portable mixers for a good time, if you have a deep pocketbook)",1403613351

Also air handling is always best done as slowly as possible, because you&#x27;re trying to move air, not make noise and turbulence.

7937275,comment,7933697,7935459,2,0,_delirium,,,"In a way the progress of Sage actually does remind me that Mathematica and the new Wolfram stuff are pretty impressive. I think eventually Sage will overtake it, and I personally feel much more comfortable doing science on top of an open-source stack. But Mathematica was pretty ahead of its time with some of the ideas that are now being implemented on the open-source side of things, like the live &quot;notebook&quot; interface (which Mathematica has had since the &#x27;80s). I think it had/has a lot of the right ideas about how to build an interactive workbench that ties together a bunch of built in functionality, with both graphical and REPL/language interfaces to it. And I think the Wolfram Language stuff is making the right moves in generalizing that to data-mining/ML, cloud integration, domain-specific things like built-in mapping support, etc. It&#x27;s less of a revolution than Wolfram wants you to believe, but it&#x27;s still good, quite well designed.<p>There are bits of that concept that come from elsewhere, so it&#x27;s not 100% novel coming from nowhere. E.g. older computer-algebra systems, Matlab, etc., all have bits of the ideas that this particular class of mathematics+data systems is converging on. But prior to the current wave of open-source stuff, I think Mathematica had the best example of integrating it all into a usable system. It might still be the most polished and integrated one out there; parts of Sage still very much feel like libraries with different conceptual/interaction models, glued together with a thin layer of Python glue. Though Sage does have the advantage of being able to add functionality at a more rapid pace, and I assume the integration will get more seamless in the future.",1403612417

7937270,comment,7931192,7937009,1,0,dalke,,,"In the late 1990s, with the rise of cell phones, people were worried that the RF energy from the phones and towers, while low, might cause physiological problems. The first paper specifically concerns this topic. Note that it says &quot;It was concluded that, although hazards from exposure to high-level (thermal) RF fields were established, no known health hazards were associated with exposure to RF sources emitting fields too low to cause a significant temperature rise in tissue.&quot;<p>The second paper is because starting even by the late 1980s there was a concern that the background 50Hz/60Hz EMF from power lines might be causing a problem. There was a 1979 epidemiological association between power lines and childhood leukemia. See <a href=""http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/magnetic-fields"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Risk/magnetic-f...</a> for more details. This second paper presents a hypothesis for how that mechanism might work, should it exist.<p>The third paper rings warning bells. For example, it references clinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00805337 but the research protocol was never explained in the submission, and no research results were ever published there. It was also registered at about the time the paper you pointed to would have been submitted, so it feels like it was added because it was required by the publisher, and not because it was a well-run clinical trial.<p>Also, frequencies like 10456.383 Hz are incredibly precise; to the point of unbelievability. They don&#x27;t show a plot of the signal as a function of frequency, they don&#x27;t have information about reproducibility, and they don&#x27;t describe control, since surely they should have RF interference from the environment, and feedback effects from the equipment itself.<p>In any case, the last 4 papers all list B. Pasche as a co-author, and from the conflict of interest section in one of the papers it says &quot;Boris Pasche and Alexandre Barbault have filed applications for patent protection and hold patents related to electromagnetic fields amplitude-modulated at tumor-specific frequencies as they relate to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. They hold stocks in TheraBionic.&quot;<p>Thus, they aren&#x27;t really independent confirmations of some observed effects, are they? Why did you list them all?",1403612299

Visitors can still vote on anything, but only registered users can submit content. We&#x27;re hoping this will increase the quality of the content a bit, while also allowing us to provide more functionality to the users who do sign up. Some if those added features include email controls, a scoring system for users, and a commenting system for each scenario. As the site scales, the commenting will allow for discussion of merits or the scenarios and words. Finally, we&#x27;ve implemented a new emailing system to give users a &quot;daily digest&quot; of what&#x27;s changed for them on the site. Before, you&#x27;d receive an email anytime something happened on your username - that sucked if your submission became popular. Now, everything is compiled into one email, which gets sent once per day, max.<p>There are lots of other, smaller changes as well, all geared toward increasing retention and sharing, but those outlined above are the major changes.",1403611442
