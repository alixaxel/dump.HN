When I was at university a while ago, we were told to go and write the algorithm down on paper before coding it - a practice I find way more helpful today than any unit testing framework.<p>The niggley little things that cause syntax errors are likely to cause an order of magnitude more mental effort than trying to find a key. Or a crap algorithm  because you dived straight into the code.<p>As a side note, many terminals have tab completion and most IDE&#x27;s have something similar.

Have a realistic budget. You get what you pay for. Yes, there are  differences between countries, and not everyone needs to charge $100 an hour to make ends meet but when you&#x27;re hiring a developer for $15 an hour (from anywhere in the world), you&#x27;re taking a huge risk.<p>2.

7925431,comment,7924523,7925268,8,0,pascal_cuoq,,,"> I disagree that the tests are not obviously worth keeping. Having a large suite of regression tests is vital to stop bugs reappearing.<p>What I left implicit is that a non-reduced Csmith test makes a terrible regression test. It may for instance spend several seconds incrementing a counter from 0 to 4000000000 before switching to the entirely unrelated computation that once triggered a bug. The value of these randomly generated tests is in generating a new one the next time, not in saving them to run again and again. Running the same randomly generated tests again and again would find very few bugs and would be a criminal waste of electricity.<p>The <i>reduced</i> program is worth keeping as a regression test, because it is typically a few lines long and these few lines contain a construct that once tripped the compiler. Sometimes the reduced version can be rewritten by a human to be even more concise and readable than the output of C-reduce. But as I said in another comment, one compiler&#x27;s regression test does not obviously make a good test for another compiler.",1403369607

I became the technical resource for a creative agency by just calling them up and asking them if they needed technical help.

I have 6 years of outsourcing experience and I agree it&#x27;s part luck, but there are great ways to spot out great talent on outsourcing platforms such as oDesk. I usually set aside a few thousand (not $100k like kator mentioned, but around $2-10k), and post a project on all three of the major platforms; oDesk, Freelancer, and Elance. This project will only be a small portion of the whole project to gauge how the developer works and if that is in line of how I work, can be different for you. I found more success on oDesk than the other two, but I wouldn&#x27;t limit to just one source for talent.<p>Things I avoid:<p>- Groups where I have to talk to a Project Manager. Especially where the Project Manager is the translator to the team because this can cause a lot of misinterpretation and mis-communication.<p>- Non-English developers. This doesn&#x27;t mean the developer has to be fully fluent in English, but if they can&#x27;t convey their ideas via text/email where they have as much time as they need then it&#x27;s hard vice versa.<p>- Yes-(wo)man. A Yes-man is a freelancer that just says yes on everything you say instead of coming up with other solutions. This is common when you deal with Project Managers.<p>Things I love:<p>- Talking to engineers and letting them know they can freely give any input.<p>- Engineers that provide feedback. I had two engineers say they can do the project in the way I wanted it, but also mentioned that they could do it a better way that&#x27;s faster, safer, and less expensive.

I have had good successs, but it was a learning process. Here&#x27;s a little bit of what I&#x27;ve learned.<p>You have to be very careful about the type of job you hire for. It needs to be highly structured, with very limited flexibility. The instructions I post are often as long as the document that needs to be written. Because my instructions are so explicit, there is little room for error. They know exactly what they need to do, and how to do it. If they screw up, I take it as a failure in my instructions, and tweak them for the next time.<p>The job details also include something about how they should write their bid. I usually ask them to write a sentence that indicates their understanding. This is usually specific, and relevant to the job, such as a list of topics they&#x27;re able to write, based on the job description. You&#x27;d be surprised how many people don&#x27;t do this. It&#x27;s a quick and easy filter.<p>Once the freelancer has successfully completed an assignment with me, they&#x27;ve earned a little bit of trust. I&#x27;ll hire them again. Eventually, I&#x27;ll give them more flexibility, more pay, and more challenging work. Most freelancers won&#x27;t get there, but that&#x27;s OK. I&#x27;ve structured things so that it&#x27;s hard to fail. It&#x27;s also not particularly easy to get ahead. They&#x27;ve got to pass the filters.",1403368365

They have a set of (currently) non-standard APIs for doing various things because the current browser standards don&#x27;t cover many of the things you need to build a usable mobile OS. They are designed to run locally stored &#x27;apps&#x27;, not just browser web pages. Some proportion of apps will not be portable. Even if they were the user is going to have to manually reinstall them. Another way of looking at it: if FirefoxOS is functionally identical to ChromeOS (ie.e. the user won&#x27;t notice switching) then why does it even exist at all? What is the point of a close if from day one you rule out the possibility of ever doing anything better or differently than the competition?<p>It really doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s possible to work around these hurdles to changing OS, it&#x27;s still a massive amount of effort to think about all these things rather than just being able to install a different browser alongside. Normal users will not be re-imaging their phones to different OSs just to try a different web browser. It just won&#x27;t happen in any great numbers. After a hard fought battle over many years to get people over the relatively small hurdle of installing Firefox on open platforms, I would expect Mozilla of all people to appreciate how difficult it would be to get people to try out different browsers in a world.<p>Also, I know it&#x27;s kind of taboo to talk about this around here, but it&#x27;s worth also mentioning what web apps mean for user privacy and data security. You seem to be suggesting that people only use web apps where their data is never stored locally, only in the cloud. In data centres where governments can mine it (often without warrants or any kind of due process), where it can be mined to build profiles on users for advertising or insurance purposes. That kind of app also leaves user vulnerable to all their data disappearing when the web service they use runs out of money or gets bought out or just decides to ditch a feature.",1403367483

I don&#x27;t include it in my search at all because I have close to zero tolerance for being on webcam as a form of logging hours (Pretty much every contract I do has a bunch of work away from the computer).  In order for me to put up with that you&#x27;d need to pay me a large premium.  You also either need to not assign me any work complicated enough to want to do pen and paper/whiteboard work on or pay an additional premium to make up for the unbilled hours (similarly if I have to start a webcam every time I reply to off hours e-mail or it&#x27;s free (especially if my off-hours e-mail responses are unbilled if I answer on a phone).  I imagine a lot of senior contractors feel similarly, oDesk type sites seems to have a lot of bad experiences for contract work and a lot of joke employers enough so that it doesn&#x27;t become a part of your get work strategy if you have other good ways of sourcing work.<p>With regards to recruiting and the 20% good recruiters charge, most companies are set up to expect recruiting fees and don&#x27;t convert the extra cash into rates or wages when they don&#x27;t have to pay them -- in theory a company that spends $0 on recruiting fees should have 20% more to pay, in practice it almost never works that way so avoiding recruiting fees seems to be a one-sided benefit.  If you&#x27;re good enough to get quality contracts through a good recruiter, you&#x27;re not going to make more money on oDesk and you&#x27;ll lose billable hours to managing site profile, and going through entire bid/negotiation and in some cases estimation processes without getting paid.  Assuming that most contract developers feel the same way, the site is likely to cater to the bottom of the market, which makes finding talent extremely hard.<p>Remote work has it&#x27;s own challenges, the things that I&#x27;ve found essential is:<p>- Great communication\n- Great documentation\n- Smart lightweight processes\n- At certain stages of company avoid outright remote (even 9 days remote + 1 day in office every 2 weeks is a very different animal from outright remote -- you actually meet everyone in the company in person in one of these two cases)\n- Personality and culture fit as well as general empathy are important: negotiation and responsibility under pressure with people you&#x27;ve never met in person is difficult.\n- Great management\n- Manage time zone differential if the product is subject to lots of change: (12 hour cycles for back and forth Q&A on something that&#x27;s unclear is extremely expensive).<p>Note that by great in the above requirements, I mean higher quality than most early stage start-ups achieve.",1403367453

We are implementing a feature that will allow bloggers to simply input the URL of their post on Blogger or Wordpress and automatically assign a digital object identifier (DOI) to their post.  The advantages of this are as follows:<p>1. Our commenting/review system is superior to that of most blogs (comments can be voted up/down and rated)<p>2. DOIs are assigned at authors discretion for every publication/post.<p>3. Different metrics will be available for every publication/post (Altmetrics to be implemented in the future).<p>4. We will be implementing a system to validate reviewers/writers by cross referencing major scientific indices.  Certain posts then have the potential to be indexed in major scientific indices in the future (i.e. if they have enough positive reviews from enough validated reviewers)<p>5. The formatting of the posts on The Winnower and the entire site are professionally designed.<p>6. We are actively advertising to other scientists and bringing them to the site.<p>7.

I was there when fm acquired themes.org and was one of the main people tasked with ensuring the HUGE db of themes was sanely migrated into the fm backend. We had stupidly high standards, and I don&#x27;t think a lot of people really knew how much we threw out over the years, or how much we sanitised the entries (so much broken English!). We also had to (to a certain degree) sanity check the projects - make sure they looked like they did what they did. One of the best projects I ever had to say no to was a &quot;next-gen compression tool&quot; which came during a bit of a fad for these in the early 2000s and basically converted everything to binary and got rid of the 0s. (Not surprisingly, there wasn&#x27;t an &quot;unzip&quot; tool!) Nice try, guy!<p>Another story I remember is all the flak we got when we opened the osx.freshmeat.net section - we got so much criticism about how we&#x27;d sold out etc. etc. but it actually turned out to be quite a good repository for OS X apps for a while until iTunes kinda took over.<p>Good times :D",1403366750

Assuming this would be feasible, you could just have it turned off whenever you are not on calls or whenever you don&#x27;t need your phone to tell you your location.<p>I&#x27;m not really sure it&#x27;s feasible, though. I don&#x27;t know the details of how phones interact with towers, but I would think that what&#x27;s happening is that your phone broadcasts a radio signal, and that same exact signal is picked up by more than one tower. If you want to triangulate the location of the radio signal, you don&#x27;t need to know how long it took to get to the tower, you just need to know how much longer it took to get to one tower than the other, and the locations of the two towers.<p>Additionally, I think you can make a similar calculation based on signal strength if you can account for anisotropies in the attenuation of the signal. This seems less reliable to me, but if this is how it is done you could potentially throw off your location by a little bit by putting your phone in a partially shielded case that increases the attenuation on one side relative to another.",1403366527
