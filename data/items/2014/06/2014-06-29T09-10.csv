7960805,comment,7960540,7960540,0,0,nwalfield,,,"This post is disingenuous.  In particular:<p><pre><code>  [Cloud Operating Systems] enable the vision of light and fast application servers, while preserving the superior security and flexibility of true hypervisors.\n</code></pre>\nHypervisors are only secure if you don&#x27;t need any sharing.  If you have two applications running as separate guests and they need to exchange data, then all of the security issues that you&#x27;d have on a normal OS return, but they are harder to solve, because the Hypervisor doesn&#x27;t provide much support!<p>As an extreme case, consider running all of your applications on your Desktop in their own VM.  Now, you are in your web browser and you download a Word document that you want to edit.  Somehow, you have to transfer this document to the Word Processor VM to edit it (they have different file systems so you need to use something like scp).  If, after you&#x27;re done editing it, you need to send it to someone via email, then you&#x27;ll have to copy it to the Email VM.  It&#x27;s not how to see how this seriously impacts usability!<p>When sharing is required, then a Hypervisor is not helpful.  That&#x27;s not to say that Hypervisors are useless, as the author claims his opponents say.  Hypervisors are good for running different operating systems on the same hardware and they are good at isolating the different OSes from each other.  However, once any sharing is required, hypervisors are not the right tools for the job.",1404035950

Together they add:<p>- Religion\n- Trade routes\n- Ideologies (enhanced late game Social policies)\n- Tourism (enhanced cultural victory)\n- Spying\n- World congress (binding resolutions! and makes diplomacy actually useful, buying votes from AI civs etc)\n- Unique civs, like Austria who can buy city states to expand their empire<p>Vanilla Civ 5 was quite disappointing and dull (get science, make army, total war).

Which is a better growth hack?",,"So I&#x27;m building a wishlist mobile app and I&#x27;m thinking of setting a limit on the number of items a user can add (say 10 items) and then to unlock ability to add unlimited items, ask the user to invite a certain number of friends (say 10) or share a link to the application on Facebook (or Twitter).<p>So, my questions are<p>1. Is this an effective growth hack? Some people most likely will be PO by this social engineering but will that be outweighed by the rest of the users who go ahead and invite their friends or share the app link?<p>2. Which one would be better - inviting friends or sharing about the app on Facebook (or Twitter)?<p>Looking forward to reading your thoughts.",1404035874
7960801,comment,7960749,7960749,4,0,vitovito,,,"There are some assumptions in here we have to take apart.<p>First, if you&#x27;re not a corporation, there isn&#x27;t &quot;really&quot; equity.  LLCs have ownership, but it&#x27;s not stock like it is in a C corp, it&#x27;s just whatever you define it to be.  If you&#x27;re an LLC which will eventually reorganize into C corp, or just a bunch of people puttering around together in your spare time, there&#x27;s no legal structure or contract which could <i>guarantee</i> that the final incorporated form of your startup will preserve the equity arrangements you&#x27;ve discussed.<p>It is entirely possible, perhaps even likely, that someone will get screwed, when incorporation time comes.  As such, I don&#x27;t really see a point in formally defining equity for a non-C corp.  Either everyone trusts each other or they don&#x27;t, but paperwork isn&#x27;t going to fix that.<p>Someone will sputter, &quot;but you could just put it in a contract!&quot;  Yes, but if you can&#x27;t afford to sue me over the terms of the contract when I form a new C corp without you, then what&#x27;s the point?  (I assume that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re not incorporated yet, that you don&#x27;t want to spend a few thousand dollars for paperwork, and that your co-founders probably won&#x27;t, either.)<p>The other problem you have by not incorporating is there&#x27;s no independent entity which owns all the IP.  When your co-founders write code, who owns it?  Where is that defined?  How is ownership transferred from them to the startup?  If this is their side project, do their employment contracts allow them to have side projects, or do their employers own everything they do?  Are they using their work computers to work on anything for your startup?  Etc.<p>So, in a sense, it doesn&#x27;t matter what percentage you say they have, nor how you validate it, because those arrangements aren&#x27;t worth the paper they&#x27;re printed on.<p>That said, my fourth startup attempt went the unincorporated route.  We had a gentleman&#x27;s agreement around IP and ownership.  We used Joel Spolsky&#x27;s equity plans, most recently discussed here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7610781"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7610781</a><p>All the original founders were the first tier, sharing 50% ownership.  We were all equally side-project-ing it; there were no full-time founders.  Additional rounds of founders would have been in one of the subsequent 10% tiers.  If we had any full-time founders, I&#x27;m not sure what we would have done; perhaps full-timers in one 30% tier, and part-timers in a shared 20% tier, to keep the 50% bracket for original founders.<p>For IP, we agreed to each retain ownership of our own code, and non-exclusively license it to each other person, for the purposes of working on a group project.  We had a shared private code repository; anything in there was understood to be licensed as such, and only the things in there.<p>Everyone understood that all of this was effectively non-binding, but we all trusted each other, and the expectation was, come time to launch the app we were working on, we&#x27;d incorporate at that point, and formally define all of this.",1404035851

Which means that your 10 old servers, running various unix and windows versions and hardware whose spare parts are difficult to find, can be easily replaced by a single modern machine, usually not even particularly beefy by modern standards.<p>It solves a lot of problems in small to medium companies; it&#x27;s an answer to a desperate call for help of sysadmins too tired to hunt 15 years old cpu fans on ebay, and managers hearing always the same infernal stories about what it&#x27;s like to do anything down in the basement.<p>It solves the problem of the same small to medium companies having to buy new hardware for each application they buy, usually because the vendor tells them to do so. Many software started to get shipped as a whole OS stack, because that was easier for the vendor to support.<p>It solves many other problems, but let&#x27;s stop here.\nThese problems are going to stay, and so will virtualization.<p>However containers offer a way to isolate your environment so that they can survive longer and coexist better with other apps. If you build your environments using those building blocks, then after 10 years, you&#x27;ll have a slightly smaller mess (which you can still handle with virtualization).<p>If you really have a lot of machines then, you need to have a good system for managing your hardware, for bulk installation etc. You have to manage new kernel and container management software rollouts in more or less the same way you&#x27;d need to manage hypervisor rollouts.<p>But since you have a lot machines, which means that you encounter hardware failure more often, the relatively higher frequency of kernel and container management software updates has still a smaller cost than virtualization overhead (provided you have enough machines).<p>Or put in another way, virtualization overhead is negligible if you&#x27;re a small fish. It&#x27;s cheaper for you to buy more machines or a stronger machines if all you need is to cover for that overhead.",1404034784

7960757,comment,7960629,7960629,3,0,omarhegazy,,,"Getting indie developers on board with Linux shouldn&#x27;t be hard in the coming future. Linux is rapidly growing and is started to be seen by the public eye as an OS some people would actually personally use for their own personal computer. Also, Unity and Unreal Engine 4, the two biggest engines indie studios use to develop 3D games, both easily support developing for Linux. Lastly, and most importantly, these guys don&#x27;t have a choice. If they want to compete with the triple-A market they have to expose themselves to the biggest market they can.<p>To get the triple-A companies on board is a tougher problem. The most-thorough and simplest solution is to get more Linux users. Triple-A companies use engines built on top of DirectX because DirectX works much better than OpenGL on Windows and everyone uses Windows (like, everyone. Windows still has 90%+ market share). If you pulled the rug under that logic by having everyone use Linux, you would force triple-A companies to support multiplatform engines and graphics APIs. Just because this solution is simple doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s easy. Linux market share is currently pathetic. There are more Vista users than there are Linux users. While on forums and discussions and other virtual agoras, evangelists annually preach &quot;the year of the Linux desktop&quot; and with each patch to every WiFi driver pundits will make blog posts about how better Linux is getting and how no one likes Windows 8 and just-you-wait, the fact of the matter is, before Linux topples Windows in the market share graphs, it has to start toppling &quot;Other&quot; in the market share graphs. And it&#x27;s pretty obvious why Linux isn&#x27;t getting the market share it deserves. 1. No one wants to install a new operating system on their computer, and the fact that people have to know what an operating system is at all is a tragic case of a leaky abstraction, because people don&#x27;t want operating systems, they want pictures and videos and music and Facebook and e-mail, 2. No one wants to deal with WiFi and graphics driver issues, and 3. No one wants to think for a single second past &quot;Best Buy&quot; when they want to buy a new craptop for their lovely little girl going to college (which I think is why Win8.x is beating both OS X and Linux combined despite being an objectively worse OS), and you sure as hell won&#x27;t be finding any Linux at Best Buy. Marketing exists for a reason.  Older computer geeks with long beards remember buying the  Macintosh 128K for being the first computer with an effective implementation of a GUI and a mouse; many other people will remember buying the Macintosh because the 1984 ad caused Apple to explode in the public eye and turned Steve Jobs from one of those computer people into a heavily publicized rock star. Apple would continue to master and practically define hype, and while OS X isn&#x27;t faring as well in the market share war, what Apple really is focusing on -- iOS -- is killing it. Until the Linux folks discover how important marketing stuff is, they won&#x27;t capture the people who don&#x27;t care enough about their machines to think past &quot;what&#x27;s the most popular thing being used right now?&quot;<p>These are huge issues, and until they get solved, you won&#x27;t be seeing Linux with a high marketshare, which means no triple-A company will bat it a single eyelash.<p>The easiest solution, although less effective than the first one, is to increase marketshare in platforms that are not Windows. This is because most platforms that are not Windows will require use of APIs that are multiplatform, making it frictionless to port to Linux. Somehow get people to game through the browser by making it possible to run triple-A games in Chrome? Good. Linux has Chrome. Get people to game mainly on OS X? Good. OS X games usually use OpenGL, and that&#x27;s easy to port to Linux. Because this isn&#x27;t as direct, you will always get some people who give so little shits about a set of OSes that have less users than &quot;Other&quot; does that they won&#x27;t go through the effort of clicking the checkbox next to Linux in the engine project setup page, but it&#x27;s somewhat of a solution.",1404034033

7960746,comment,7958962,7959675,1,0,_delirium,,,"> In the history of the world, economists and government planners have never been able to manage an economy better than the capitalisic model of individuals in pursuit of their own goals.<p>What is an example of a successful state that has <i>chosen</i> between these two models? The successful economies are all mixed economies, with a strong role for both government planning and private competition. Germany is perhaps the canonical example of following this mixed-economy model as an explicit theory (vs. just stumbling into it). Other successful countries mostly deviate a little to one side or the other: the Nordic countries traditionally have more planning than Germany does (especially around infrastructure, urban planning, and major industrial initiatives), while the U.S. traditionally has less. But we&#x27;re talking about modest variations: the U.S. public sector is ~35-40% of GDP, Germany&#x27;s is ~40-45% of GDP, and the Nordic countries are at ~50-55% of GDP. Nobody is running a successful economy with a public sector at ~5-10% of GDP.<p>I suspect the Chinese mixed model is also going to prove quite dominant in the 21st century. Compared to the European social market economies, it&#x27;s less social, but more centrally planned, which may or may not be an advantage.",1404032855

You can run most accepted psychological effects done with smaller sample sizes over a much greater sample size and expect to see a smaller effect size.
