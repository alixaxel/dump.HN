7960870,comment,7956470,7960737,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> You can run most accepted psychological effects done with smaller sample sizes over a much greater sample size and expect to see a smaller effect size<p>This is because, not to put too fine a point on it, the effects aren&#x27;t real. The statistical power of a study places a <i>lower</i> limit on the effect size the study is capable of reporting (for a given p-value threshold). So underpowered studies report absurdly high effect sizes (for whatever phenomenon is being studied) because they&#x27;re not capable of showing statistical significance for smaller effect sizes. Andrew Gelman likes to write about this. The upshot is that, if an effect isn&#x27;t real, a paper demonstrating statistical significance (traditionally, p < 0.05) will tend to report an effect size close to the minimum it can -- since the true effect size is small, you&#x27;re much more likely to find data showing a large effect size than a gargantuan effect size. Then, obviously, a study with larger N will show a smaller effect size still, because it has the power to show P < 0.05 at that smaller effect size. But the true effect size doesn&#x27;t change from experiment to experiment -- the true effect size is the effect size you would measure at N = ∞. There is no reason to expect the effect size to diminish in the face of a larger study <i>unless you expected that it was smaller than originally reported</i>. I could measure the extra time required for an apple to hit the ground when released from 9 feet up instead of 4 feet up. The effect size, measured in seconds, will not steadily diminish as I measure more and more apples; it will stabilize at a quarter of a second.<p>As your parent comment points out, this study, with its very large sample size, has the statistical power to report a small effect size, which is what it&#x27;s doing. However, a very small effect size is just another way of saying &quot;this effect, while just barely large enough to measure, is much too small to matter to anyone&quot;.",1404039217

However, it also sounds like a bit of a beat-up, like the Strava lawsuit.<p>You are not gauranteed by Facebook for a service that allows you to communicate in a clearly defined way. They are allowed to, an do, tweak it constantly to improve whatever metric they think will result in more engagement and bottom line. Much like google tweaks their search results (or their cafeteria food) these companies are always running experiments. In this case, it resulted in a paper. The researchers who published the paper might have to ensure they upheld the ethical obligations of the journal, and any affiliated institutions. If they did, the fact this is published is a better outcome then normal.<p>[0] <a href=""http://cyclingtips.com.au/2012/06/strava-lawsuit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cyclingtips.com.au/2012/06/strava-lawsuit/</a>",1404036541

Those who <i>can</i> or <i>choose</i> to use such approaches will benefit from the best of both worlds.<p>In general, I see things like Docker/Mirage/Xen to be complementary, rather than antagonistic. A good example of this is Google&#x27;s Docker support, which is via a custom VM.<p><a href=""https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/containers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/containers</a>",1404036410

You&#x27;ll probably end up cycling through a bunch of people before finding anybody of co-founder quality.<p>You&#x27;ll meet a lot of people who are really excited to be involved in a startup, and then a month later learn that they don&#x27;t have it, or that there are fundamental differences in the way you guys do things. It&#x27;s super hard to find &quot;co-founders&quot; which are totally a type of person.<p>My two first co-founders were very experienced. I picked this up from them.<p>Find out what they do and if you even like them, etc. After the trial period, negotiate based on their value, quality (experience, exceptional skills) etc. and risk they&#x27;re taking (time spent) with emphasis on output (value). MAKE IT VERY CLEAR from the outset that the work you&#x27;re doing together is to see how things go. If it doesn&#x27;t work out, you go your separate ways. People who have done this before will appreciate this method and those are the people you want as a cofounder! You can set the trial period for 1 to 3 months.",1404036241
