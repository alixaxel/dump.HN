7964117,comment,7962361,7962361,1,0,quarterwave,,,"The first question to ask may well be &quot;why does my problem need computation on a commodity cluster?&quot;. A massive multi-player spaceship battle may be best served by a HPC environment, using C++ and MPI. There&#x27;s probably only a limited class of distributed problems that map nicely to a commodity cluster. Several worthy commentators have pointed out that even if the systems programming environment offered the same verbs for both, commodity network latency makes &quot;distributed concurrency&quot; very different from &quot;in-box concurrency&quot;. To loosely borrow a term from physics, time delays can break the scaling symmetry of a renormalization group.<p>A systems architect with a sound background in mathematics may be able to reason out the cluster performance of a social algorithm operating on a Erdos-Renyi random graph. Plodders such as myself will try to prototype. I&#x27;ll insist that a prototype has business value if only because otherwise I have no way of appearing to be busy.<p>For prototyping a distributed system on a commodity cluster, my personal preference would be Erlang. As rvirding commented with great insight in another post, Erlang has an OS feel to it. From my limited perspective, Erlang spares me the trouble of knowing Unix and networking (for example: I don&#x27;t need to know what a TCP port is). Erlang gives me a minimal & consistent set of verbs, and that&#x27;s all I need for prototyping.",1404114094

Except of course when it does (bastard question for those who think they know : what does range do on a nil channel ?)<p>Despite all these clarity claims, go has significant pitfalls, like the nil channel above (and you will enounter nil channels). There&#x27;s other things, like &quot;what is a pointer in Go&quot;, if your answer involves &quot;*&quot;, I urge you to reconsider (hint : what&#x27;s the difference between []int and [5]int ? Is one of them a pointer ? What about channels (of course I talked about nil channels) ? Maps ?<p>But every type can be typedeffed to a pointer type of itself, like in Pascal (lots of things look like pascal), and result in completely unpredictable reference or value semantics (or my favorite : partial reference semantics).<p>Does go have generics ? YES (make, range, ...). Go has something no other language has : return type generic function types (meaning a functions meaning changes depending on what you assign the result to, like range). Does Go have operator overloading ? Is Go object oriented ? YES (including single inheritance). YES. Does go have (complicated language feature X) ? Probably yes. But all of these features are only accessible to Rob Pike, who has apparently decided that nobody has any use for any kind of tree or graph data structures, matrices, complex numbers, or so.<p>In practice you can catch the go team themselves in errors on the language semantics in their presentations, so I think a VERY strong case can be made that it&#x27;s not at all that obvious.<p>But the truth is : this language, due to politics (high position of it&#x27;s inventor) has 10 or so FTE behind it, with lots of paid people contributing various small bits. Is it anything more than some guys idea of his own favorite programming language ?<p>The honest answer is simply : no.<p>The only real advantage Go has is a small, yet functional and pretty complete standard library (like C++ had in the 1980s).

I use it as my primary mode of transportation, with Car2Go a distant second.  The measure seeking more funding for Metro (I assume you mean King County TBD Prop 1) was to replace funding that got crushed in the economic downturn and resulting plunge in sales tax.  Funding transit by sales tax is unstable but it&#x27;s all the legislature gives us, other than vehicle registration fees that everyone seems to hate.  Prop 1 passed 2-to-1 in Seattle and, if a similar plan goes to the city voters in November, I bet it passes.<p>Metro&#x27;s &quot;mismanagement&quot; is because it is directly accountable to the King County Council and, thus, to politically-motivated voters.

7964060,comment,7961948,7961948,1,0,Locke1689,,,"Good article. A lot of the criticisms are ones that I often hit as well. I would probably dispute the asynchrony/performance one, though. C# async is very efficient -- a lot more efficient than many other eventing frameworks in many other languages. In addition, I don&#x27;t really think that locks are specifically put ahead of lock-free things like InterlockedExchange when dealing with multithreaded code -- it&#x27;s just that writing lock-free datastructures is so damn complicated (seriously, read the literature, it&#x27;s really hard to get right), that for the everyday programmer a lock is the way to go. Moreover, there&#x27;s not really a connection between async/eventing and locking; they&#x27;re somewhat orthogonal. In large applications I would probably see a healthy dose of both. Async doesn&#x27;t help with CPU-bound computation and threads aren&#x27;t really the best way to deal with concurrent IO-bound computation.<p>Otherwise, I strongly agree with the points about Mono. Speaking personally, I would love if more of the .NET platform were extended for use on Linux, as I think the Windows CLR GC is still pretty far ahead of the Mono implementation.",1404112121

The comments in the ipwatchdog article are interesting.<p>> My company is 3 years old. We have taken nothing from them, or anyone else. We launched our products to avoid them and their infringement zeal. Our products are innovative, less costly, and preferred in the market. As our market penetration has increased, they have been busy reworking their patents (by flooding the US Patent Office with new documents and revision requests) with the aim of shaking us (and any other new competitors) down. So, we are faced with terrible choices. We can fight in court to prove our case – at a cost of $2 million or more, or we can pay them unearned royalties. In either case we are losers in this scenario. The hospitality industry also continues to lose.<p>> As for now, you are right, you are faced with terrible choices. But did you do any kind of evaluation to determine whether you would be infringing any patents? My guess is you did not. I’d also be interested in knowing whether you have patent infringement insurance to cover your defense costs? My guess is you don’t have that either. If it is the case, as it usually is, that you did not engage in any kind of research in advance of launching your product and you do not have patent infringement insurance it would seem that your poor business choices are what has put you in this position rather than any defect in the patent system. The patent system is operating exactly as designed.<p>Ouch. Spoken like a true lawyer.
