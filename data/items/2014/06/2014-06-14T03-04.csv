Since you changed the words, why didn&#x27;t you just say so, instead of trying to defend your straw man?<p>Also, now that you&#x27;ve changed the words, I still disagree with what you wrote, because you&#x27;re making an implicit assumption as to what it means for a company to be important, without defining that assumption. And without defining that assumption, you don&#x27;t really have a basis for claiming that the op is wrong. Obviously op is wrong <i>by your definition of important</i>, but not wrong by their definition of important.<p>But at least it isn&#x27;t a straw man anymore.<p>> <i>And given that all you&#x27;ve done here is attack, attack, attack, what do you expect me to do other than be defensive?</i><p>I told you that you were committing a very obvious logical fallacy, and instead of simply saying &quot;you&#x27;re right, I&#x27;ve now changed the wording so my argument is no longer depending upon that logical fallacy&quot;, you started trying to accuse me of what is ultimately a meaningless non-semantic distinction in an attempt to trivialize and discredit my original response.<p>> <i>Since you like logic, you&#x27;ll like this: if you don&#x27;t understand what I&#x27;m saying, then it&#x27;s not a straw man on my part</i><p>That&#x27;s bullshit. I <i>do</i> understand what you&#x27;re saying. It may not be what you <i>meant</i> to say, but I can&#x27;t look inside your head and figure out what you meant to say, all I can do is respond to the actual argument you write down. If that argument is wrong, the fault does not lie with me in pointing out the straw man, the fault lies with you in not expressing your argument in a manner that can be understood correctly and without logical fallacy.<p>> <i>Not once have you &#x27;just admitted&#x27; that you might have been off-kilter, not even an &quot;I still disagree with you, but yeah, I could have behaved better&quot;</i><p>What? What is this, kindergarden? Do I have to apologize to you for disagreeing with your argument and pointing out a logical fallacy? That&#x27;s ridiculous. Nothing I have said in this thread is needlessly antagonistic or rude, or otherwise uncalled-for. The fact that you went on the defensive instead of appropriately responding to my criticism does not make my criticism something that I need to apologize for.",1402718190

One who do things that make other people&#x27;s life better. Others who reap benefits of things done by the former group. To me the question is about whether you want to be selfless in the service of others or live a steady life. Once you have figured out, there is no shame in failing if your goals are high and intentions are right. If you base your success based on how people perceive you that is a very wrong way to think. The only reason because public opinion tends to change very so often. So, for me at least, being successful implies reaching for a bigger goal than the self. Being principled and finding happiness in doing the right thing.\nJust imagine if Nelson Mandela, Gandhi, Dr King, etc would have only thought for themselves what kind of a messed up world we all would have been living in?\nWith greater goals come even greater challenges in some shape or form of &quot;failures.&quot; &quot;If There Is No Struggle, There Is No Progress”",1402717458

The $1100 interview reimbursement we received from YC only covered 1/3 of the cost of the trip and the time/energy spent applying could have been time and money spent coding and developing our product (and paying rent).<p>In the last 7 months I&#x27;ve managed to burn through my 401k from years software engineering jobs in pursuit building a cash medicine marketplace.  I barely have enough money to pay my rent next month.  In a desperate attempt to find capital, I also charged a trip to San Jose on my credit card 2 weeks ago to knock on doors up and down Sand Hill Road.<p>If you or anyone on this forum is interested in starting a cash medicine marketplace there is an opportunity to change the world and this needs to be done.  Ironically my wife has horrible stomach problems and I spent two hours calling GI/colonoscopy doctors trying to find a cash price as I will be charging this on my credit cards as well.<p>I am desperate to start this and I don&#x27;t care if I end up with 1/10000th of founder ownership at the end.  We have a working provider site with several providers (18k lines of code).  The other engineer on my team is smart (Stanford educated) and an awesome co-founder to work with.<p>Am I depressed? Yes.  Am I giving up?  Never.<p>My contact info is joe (at) openhospital.com if you Sam or anyone on this forum would like to chat.<p>Joe Arnone

Outside of Iraq, there&#x27;s Nigeria, Mali, Western Sahara, Sudan, China, Phillipines, Russia (basically the entire border of where muslims live geographically, actually).<p>I get the impression that what&#x27;s really happening is that the US is no longer policing the world, the legacy it got from WWII. The old empires are in the same situation, and we&#x27;re returning to the historical norm before that. That historical norm was 1.5 millenia of islam versus everyone else war, with more victims than any other conflict in history. Constant civil wars at the edges of muslim territories and regular genocides inside of it.

And yes, there are &quot;natural&quot; commons, like the athmosphere, but those are unsolved problems.<p>> The concentration of resources is typically avoided through wealth redistribution, another mechanism of mandatory altruism.<p>Again if this works, it&#x27;s not altruism for the same reason that Ford&#x27;s actions weren&#x27;t altruistic. They were a business investment that would force others to make the same investment, and he was gambling that people would invest it in buying his cars. He was right. This is the same thing, only at a country level.<p>That&#x27;s assuming it works.

They explain that they need a car with lots of cargo room, is reliable, cheap to maintain, and which is good in icy conditions.<p>The dealer proceeds to talk the buyer into buying a 20 year old porsche 911.  It doesn&#x27;t satisfy any of the stated needs and costs the buyer money that they didn&#x27;t need to spend.  The dealer&#x27;s actions were clearly unethical.  But, should they be illegal?
