However, I don&#x27;t see it likely that they&#x27;re going to be number one any time soon.

7837517,comment,7837174,7837174,2,0,dennybritz,,,"In hindsight it is always easy to say &quot;If only I had validated my assumptions before building.&quot; But this neglects the fact that you must know the right question to ask and the right hypotheses to validate in the first place. Doing customer interviews without clear objectives is a waste of time. I have found that you often come across thyour hypotheses while building the product, not from before-the-fact customer interviews. Building forces you to consider the design space of your product, and raises specific questions that you can later ask your customers about.<p>So, let&#x27;s not forget the overall goal of customer validation: Learning. If you believe that you can learn more about the market and customer needs by spending a couple of days/weeks building a product before doing the next round of interviews then do that. Of course, neither building nor interviewing work in isolation. They are a continuous loop. Interviewing without building is only useful for very initial marketing research. Similarly, building without feedback can lead you down a rabbit hole. So, how do you decide what to do next? Building or collecting feedback? Do what gives you the most learning for the time spent. If you are a developer and can build things really quickly, it&#x27;s probably a good idea to do that. If you are non-technical then customer interviews may give your more learning for less time spent.",1401756409

From top to bottom, the Core Data concepts are simultaneously too low-level and too opaque.  I found myself copying multi-page code snippets from the web and hoping they would work.  Basic concepts like merging conflicts were obfuscated and brittle.  Contrast that with Firebase, which has been a real pleasure to use.<p>So I&#x27;m hopeful that CloudKit will address these issues.  Versioned schemas are great for updates but hard to get working initially.

(e.g. if you take 10 frames, the 1-2 frames where a pixel is occluded will almost certainly be an outlier to the 8-9 frames where the pixel is almost exactly the same, and the median will take the value in the middle of those 8-9 frames.<p>(Another problem with mode is that you&#x27;d have to posterize the image to ensure that shifting light, noise and camera movement don&#x27;t cause the values of background pixels to vary slightly.
