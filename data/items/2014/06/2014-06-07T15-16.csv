From what I&#x27;ve seen when people write something monolithic from scratch they just end up making similar mistakes and introduce new problems that weren&#x27;t there to begin with. Vim&#x27;s codebase isn&#x27;t terrible, it&#x27;s been going strong for 23 years, but it&#x27;s accrued a lot of technical debt that makes doing somethings difficult. It&#x27;s also controlled by a single person, and don&#x27;t get me wrong this isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing, but it makes getting in the necessary changes to achieve the goals of neovim nearly impossible.<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a>",1402156691

7862341,comment,7861874,7862014,32,0,bane,,,"The problem was the G+ was pitched as a social network. It grew, like a cancer, into some weird meta-project that defies description, and along the way fucked over lots of people who worked very hard to maintain different identities and roles in the various on-line milieus they frequented. Sometimes it was as simple as revealing their real name to their model plane group. Other times it involved just shutting down real income generating youtube channels that people had poured lots of time and effort into (thousands of hours), or revealing to abusive ex-spouses where you lived...all without any real good reason and zero upside to the users of the various Google properties and dubious upside to Google as a business.<p>This was very costly for Google just on the employment front as well. Word on the street is that Google had upwards of 1,200 employees working on the G+ project. Fully burdened, that&#x27;s something like $250-300m/year.<p>There was no upside for the entire project, for users or for google. So now, a couple $billion later, they finally realized what everybody else on the planet realized 2 years ago. They could have just surveyed users back then to find out where they were screwing up, but in typical Google fashion, that would have involved actually engaging with their users, which Google is borderline allergic to.",1402156665

7862331,comment,7861874,7861874,62,0,bane,,,"> Google+ embodied the Internet&#x27;s cardinal sin: It broke everything it touched<p>I think this is the most important single line of the piece. G+ was pretty broken from the get go despite some promising ideas. But instead of focusing around what was working, Google simply amplified all the broken garbage -- then spread it around everywhere, making everything toxic, cancerous.<p>It&#x27;s one of those many weird cases where you sit there, hands on your desk, mouth agape looking at some Google property that was fucked over by the G+ project and just ask yourself &quot;doesn&#x27;t <i>anybody</i> at Google use this garbage?&quot;. Because the issues are so immediate and so obvious, it&#x27;s impossible that nobody raised some red flags.<p>Which leaves two possibilities:<p>- Google is composed of such inept socially awkward people that no red flags were raised and they all just proceeded on course <i>doo dee doo doo dee</i> (a scenario I find very hard to believe)<p>- Red flags were raised and simply brushed aside.<p>The first scenario is hard to believe because it presumes mass and gross incompetence on behalf of most of the employees at Google. But I know googlers, I&#x27;ve been interviews by Google, I&#x27;ve had various interactions with people from Google, and most of them just seem like normal folks from a variety of backgrounds.<p>As more and more leaks out it sounds like the second scenario is where it&#x27;s at, and the question is why? Was it just some dumb headed attempt to extract any money possible for the major shareholders by turning the brand into garbage? Or was it just an honest attempt at unifying the properties, just managed at an absolutely amateurish level?<p>It&#x27;s all so senseless and stupid and now everything is broken.<p>The sad thing is, this is something I see all the time, one hopelessly broken pet project is carried by the good idea fairy to some senior manager, and they being a cascade of failures across the rest of the company on something they probably have convinced themselves is just a big gamble with lots of upside. By the time the damage is done and widely recognized, the exec is out the door on their golden parachute leaving the remaining veterans to pick up the pieces and unfuck things. Except in this case, the ultimate party responsible holds half of the majority voting rights and continues to blissfully push socially inept product ideas. The only remediation is a long unfucking process and some possible minor impact on share price, meaning he can only buy 2 300&#x27; yachts instead of 2 350&#x27; yachts.",1402156258

For simplicity&#x27;s sake, there are no penalties for signal amplification and repetition and the speed of the signal is 300000 km/s.<p>From these const&#x27;s we get that the latency (in milliseconds) of this signal would be:<p>1000 / ( 300000 / 20000 ) ~ 67 milliseconds.<p>So, 2 people, 1 in Sydney AS and the other in London UK, will have a theoretical min latency = 1000 / ( 300000 / 16983 ) ~ 57 milliseconds.<p>While this might seem OK, its far away from it - when a piano player plays on a midi keyboard, the perceptible latency between hitting a key and hearing the sound starts from 10 milliseconds, grows annoying on 20 and for most becomes hard (even impossible) to play from >30 milliseconds.<p>If I was to attempt to design a solution I would probably divide earth&#x27;s area on regions, but still I am not sure what the real distance would be for latency <=10 milliseconds?<p>It will be really interesting to read your thoughts on this topic.",1402155607

After working for 3 months he walked in and asked for some ownership. Although I viewed him as quite valuable I said no, that I&#x27;d pay him more but I wasn&#x27;t going to give him ownership (various reasons for this). Part (and only part) of my logic was that first he wasn&#x27;t going to pay in for the equity (he just wanted it) and also if the business failed he could just walk away and get a job elsewhere. So he could afford to take risks and chances that I couldn&#x27;t take.<p>For a very short period (between businesses) I worked for another company and remember how I couldn&#x27;t believe how different it was than being the owner.

7862305,comment,7861395,7861872,3,0,lawtguy,,,"That blog post looks highly suspect to me.  The AEI is reposting the work of a blogger who has taken data from two different sources: a paper on the GINI of individuals, and GINI as calculated for households and families by the CBO.  There are two big problems I see:<p>The data on families and households includes capital gains, but the data on individuals doesn&#x27;t (it includes only regular income).  He hand-waves that away by saying, without proof, that capital gains are proportional to income, so that part doesn&#x27;t matter.  Given the differences in how we tax income vs. capital gains, I think excluding them from a GINI calculation is a big deal.  Frankly I could simply interpret his chart as showing that rich are increasingly moving their gains away from income and towards capital gains to avoid taxes.<p>Second, for his graph of GINI for individuals, he&#x27;s picked the GINI only for people that have an income.  So again we&#x27;re not comparing the same kinds of numbers.  In that same paper, the one that includes everyone (not just income earners) shows increasing inequality in the last 30 years.<p>The idea is an interesting one: is the way we&#x27;re structuring our families and households leading to increased income inequality?

Hardly any of the useful stuff is part of the language, it&#x27;s all in the libraries which means that.NET code is very verbose because there is no syntax for things like lists and dictionaries.  The latest versions are getting better, at least you can create arrays using a compact syntax but dictionaries are still a pain.  Both of them are essentially C without unmanaged pointers and the addition of a few slightly better types but still scalar types are special and cannot be treated as objects.<p>Also they aren&#x27;t even usefully old-fashioned, why can&#x27;t we have arrays where the first item is number 1, or 21 or some other number, Basic had that from the beginning.  Why do I have to use a dictionary when I want to use an ordinal type such as a character or boolean as the index (Pascal could use any ordinal type as an array index).  Why can&#x27;t I create subtypes of the integers and reals (Pascal had that and it prevented large numbers of errors).  Functional languages have implemented guard clauses, these can simplify your code dramatically and remove the need for a lot of traditional if and case statements.  Bertrand Meyer integrated contracts into Eiffel almost thirty years ago, and now MS has provided them by means of a clunky add-on that rewrites your binary after it has been compiled.<p>And so on, it&#x27;s not that .NET is bad, it&#x27;s that after all that effort Anders Hejlsberg (yes, he of justified Turbo Pascal fame) should really have been able to produce something so much better, or at least more interesting.<p>Rant over, thanks for reading if you made it this far.",1402153566
