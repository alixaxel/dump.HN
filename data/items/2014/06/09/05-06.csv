Sometimes, things go smoothly, but in the worst cases, like this one, there&#x27;s a huge mismatch between &#x27;Western&#x27; quality demands and the output of their Chinese partners.<p>The typical pattern will be for the manufacturer to start sending back work which is totally unacceptable. When their partner protests, the manufacturer will grudgingly raise the standard to &#x27;barely tolerable&#x27;. Time runs out, exhaustion sets in, decision makers don&#x27;t want to draw attention to the fact that they chose the wrong manufacturer - so the client has to lower their standards.<p>Caltrans officials were amazingly naive and blinkered if they weren&#x27;t aware of the long history of stories just like this one. Perhaps they did know the history, and they thought they would be protected by quality checks embedded in the contract, but that&#x27;s just more naivety. Contracts don&#x27;t have much power in that environment, particularly when your project is already falling way behind schedule.<p>Blaming &#x27;The Chinese&#x27; though, is stupid.

Maybe it isn&#x27;t the new use-for-everything language. But at least can become the &quot;ok, use for this one area&quot; language.<p>C -- still winning in that respect. It is used in many places just because of hardware or time constraints -- drivers, micro-controllers, optimized fast parses, low level socket handling code. It just got specialized. Not used probably for business or back-end systems.<p>I don&#x27;t think PERL can claim that same. It seems to me its role has been replaced by Python, maybe Ruby, Java (for web server back-ends).<p>C++ still winning. None of the current languages including the new contenders like Rust and Go can eat its lunch (as they say) when it comes to performance. Things like games or signal processing. Anything requiring low latency responses will still see C++ being picked. And with C++11 and C++14 it is getting a new breath of fresh air. Whoever is going to contend with, will have a steep hill to climb.<p>Java? Java still winning. Now if you think of Java as JVM it is winning even more. Java itself if just a very average language that is also fairly performant, explicit, IDE friendly. If you had a lot of money and could hire potentially lots of average or below average programmers to throw at a problem (which I think often is the wrong approach, but if you did), Java is your language. And Android. Don&#x27;t forget Android. If anything it is winning just because of that.<p>> Give it 5-10 years and I expect to read &quot;Why Python Didn&#x27;t Win&quot;.
