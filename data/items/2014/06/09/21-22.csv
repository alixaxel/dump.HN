[1][2]<p>How do you program &quot;greater good&quot; in a split-second decision making scenario? How do you decide who wins and who loses, and by what criteria?<p>I&#x27;ll answer those rhetorical questions for you: you don&#x27;t.<p>The guy that darts into traffic, which results in a network of cars deciding to kill me in order to minimize &quot;overall&quot; damage to humanity? You&#x27;ve killed a person with a family, with people who rely on me to provide for them. The guy that darts into traffic is running from the police after having committed a serious crime. How do you programmatically determine that his life is more worth than mine or the others who may be impacted by avoiding just running over him in the first place?<p>You don&#x27;t. Not with a set of programmed rules in a decision making system that doesn&#x27;t have the ability to take in external variables in the process of making that decision.<p>That guy jumping into the road, with the cop chasing him that I can see on the sidewalk? I&#x27;m running over him instead of killing myself in the process. If I see that &quot;guy in the road&quot; is the entire soprano section of the Angelic Children&#x27;s Choir, then maybe I aim for the light pole and pick a deity to pray to.<p>I do not trust ANY piece of software to make that decision for me, or for anyone, for any reason, and in any situation.<p>[1] I have intentionally ditched my car in a way that I thought would result in my own demise in order to minimize damage to others. It was my choice to do so.<p>[2] I understand by getting into a vehicle that I don&#x27;t control (plane, train, bus, taxicab, etc) that I am giving that decision-making process over to someone else. But that someone else is also human, with the same ability to process external input as I would, and I entrust them to not sacrifice both of us foolishly.",1402351188

That&#x27;s how things get into standard libraries: people need these things so regularly that there&#x27;s no point in reimplementing them forever.<p>True, although I suspect there&#x27;s probably a certain amount of historical accident to the set of functions included in math.h. There&#x27;s a strong argument that some of these common &#x27;special&#x27; functions are at least as fundamental to a variety of mathematical fields as (say) arc hyperbolic cosine, although admittedly it&#x27;d probably be hard to get clear consensus on exact which.<p>I expect if you asked a variety of stats/ML geeks they might have other priorities to those given here -- e.g. I might request the digamma and trigamma functions (first and second derivatives of log gamma, useful for computing gradients in various Bayesian models) before asking for Bessel functions, say. It might also be sensible to prefer log-domain versions of some of the functions he suggests, since much practical computation with probabilities needs to happen in the log domain.",1402351100

7870744,comment,7869753,7870539,10,0,eridius,,,"If your app requires earning coins through non-gameplay mechanisms to be a good game, then it&#x27;s not a good game. If it doesn&#x27;t require that, then you can get rid of the coins entirely and still have a good game. At which point your only question is monetization.<p>May I suggest you simply add a banner ad to the game, and then provide a single IAP to remove the banner ad, for players who don&#x27;t like them? I hate banner ads, so if it&#x27;s a good game I&#x27;ll gladly pay a few dollars to kill the ads (and if it&#x27;s bad game, well, I won&#x27;t be playing anyway so it doesn&#x27;t matter what you do).<p>Don&#x27;t forget that the only players you&#x27;re getting feedback from are the ones that currently are engaged with your system. You aren&#x27;t getting feedback from any of the players that skipped your app in the first place due to the IAP/incentivized coin system. Personally, if I know a game has that sort of system, I will be far less likely to even give it a chance first.<p>---<p><i>Edit:</i> Another suggestion, which I&#x27;ve seen used in games before, is to keep the coin system, but remove all the incentivized coin stuff (no videos, etc). Then provide a way to earn coins through gameplay. And finally, provide an IAP to increase the rate at which you earn coins in-game. If you tune it correctly, the base &quot;free&quot; game could drop coins at a low-enough rate to still encourage players to seek alternate ways to gain coins, but the coin-booster IAP would then increase the rate to a level at which most players are comfortable playing without buying any more coins through IAP. Then finally, you can still offer coins through IAP for those few players that want them anyway.<p>Of course, you have to be careful with this approach, because if you don&#x27;t calibrate it right and people who bought the coin-booster still feel like they aren&#x27;t getting enough coins to reasonably play the game, then they&#x27;ll be angry. And if you give too many coins, there will be no incentive at all for anyone to buy IAP. But this just means you have to put enough thought into it to design it correctly<p>As an example of this approach, Ski Safari Adventure Time uses it (and I assume the original Ski Safari as well but I never played that). Coins are used to purchase in-game upgrades, and they&#x27;re collected through gameplay, but you can buy a one-time coin booster that doubles the coins you get through gameplay. Personally, I like this approach because it means I can feel like I paid for the game, and it makes the game playable without having to resort to non-gameplay mechanisms to acquire the needed coins. It&#x27;s also better than the ad approach because not only does it mean you don&#x27;t have to uglify your UI with ad banners (and don&#x27;t have to design a UI that can afford to give up that screen space), but buying a coin-booster like this also feels like the user is gaining a reward, as opposed to getting rid of ads which feels like the user is paying a tax, if you will.",1402350795

7870721,comment,7869904,7869904,20,0,waffle_ss,,,"I was ready to come in swinging in defending Docker, but I found myself agreeing with most of the points after spending a lot of time with Docker over the last month (ported my Rails application&#x27;s provisioning from Ansible to it).<p>I would add to the list that it is currently hard to even find decent images of popular services that you would trust deploying to production (e.g. Postgres).  I see with the launch of Docker Hub that they have some flagged as &quot;official&quot; now, but for example the Postgres one is a black box (no Dockerfile source available - not a &quot;trusted build&quot;) so I can&#x27;t trust it.[1]  I&#x27;ve had to spend time porting my Ansible playbooks over to Dockerfiles due to this.<p>I think part of the problem is that composition of images is strict &quot;subclass&quot;-type inheritance, so they don&#x27;t compose easily.  So it&#x27;s hard to maintain a &quot;vanilla&quot; image rather than a monolithic one that has everything you need to run your particular service - so people just keep their images to themselves.  For example, if I want a Ruby image that has the latest nginx and git installed, I can&#x27;t just blend three images together.  I have to pick a base image, and then manually add the rest myself via Dockerfile.<p>Also, although Vagrant 1.6 added Docker syntax, you really have to understand how Docker works in order to use it.  If you&#x27;re learning Docker I&#x27;d stick with the vanilla `docker` syntax first in building your images, maybe using something like fig[2] to start with.<p>At the end of the day it&#x27;s another abstraction to manage.  It does bring great benefits in my opinion, but the learning curve and time investment aren&#x27;t cheap, so if you already have a suite of provisioning scripts it may not be worth it to make the leap yet.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://orchardup.github.io/fig/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://orchardup.github.io/fig/</a>",1402350524
