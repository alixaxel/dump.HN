In my filter bubble (and I am in a massive filter bubble with regards to this kind of thing) the attention was similar to the rest of your comment - focusing on ebays failures of execution rather than the failure of measurement.<p>Other advertisers do not make the same mistakes as ebay with regards to landing pages, adverts or keywords selection but many make the same mistakes when it comes to measuring their advertising value.<p>Now, perhaps the errors caused by faulty measurement are not as important for other advertisers and I can see why this might be the case (for the reasons you list about how ebay is running their PPC) but what should be an opportunity for the SEM industry to look at how their work in valued and measured has instead turned into something else<p>> As a control they take MSDN/Yahoo vs. Google<p>They also used a geographic split as a control. E.g. if in the past areas A and B have performed similarly then pick one of them at random to stop showing ads in.<p>AdWords geo-targeting combined with this technique is a way for other advertisers - regardless of scale - to run similar tests.

It is charged based on where the item was bought.<p>There is a companion tax called &#x27;use tax&#x27; which mirrors the components of sales tax but it specific to the place where something is used. The &#x27;problem&#x27; that use tax was created to solve was that people would go to the city or state next door and buy things at one tax rate, for use in an area where they were also available but at a (generally) higher tax rate. Use tax laws give cities and states the power to collect the difference in taxes from the user.<p>It is nearly impossible to enforce, but it is a useful &#x27;kicker&#x27; in an audit of an entity that keeps good records.",1403466129

It did attract significant attention more than a year ago (the study was conducted in 2012, and media reported on it in early 2013).<p>&quot;eBay has no idea if online ads work&quot; would be a better title. Or &quot;eBay can&#x27;t get their online ads to work&quot;.<p>If you looked at eBay&#x27;s search advertisements in the last years you probably have seen very ridiculous ones, like:<p><pre><code>  Love.\n\n  Buy it cheap on eBay\n  Low Prices. New and used.\n</code></pre>\nThis is a significant waste of money, and seems endemic at eBay, not a rare occasion. Though it is too easy to point at this and discard the entire study, it is a relevant prior.<p>As a control they take MSDN/Yahoo vs. Google. The control should be a different advertiser, not a different advertisement network.<p>In the paper they mention removing the term &quot;eBay Shoes&quot; from their keywords, because they rank organically for that. They should have never added it, because it is a bad keyword for them. They should advertise on the brand name shoes they are selling. This ties back to the bad adverts by eBay: Fixing your mistakes and seeing change, is different from performing a controlled experiments on a healthy advertiser.<p>They muse about &quot;the types of consumer that may already be informed about the advertiser’s product&quot;. This adds a few problems: those customers may have been informed through the very advertisements they now claim don&#x27;t work. Suddenly shutting down advertisements does not negate the effects of running advertisements years before that. The paper does not investigate the effect that ads have on brand recognition and brand trust. Usability tests show people clicking on advertisements first, because then they expect quality and a simple commercially interesting proposition.<p>I do think the problem they are describing &quot;some customers may be so aware of a brand, that advertising to them becomes worthless&quot; is valid. Maybe ad networks could help here and implement a form of &quot;demarketing&quot; next to their &quot;remarketing&quot; options: Once a user has enough knowledge of the brand, stop advertising. But a better (and currently available) method could be to apply remarketing and give these power users tailored advertisements. An example could be a buyer&#x27;s program, promoting a new product from a well-purchased brand, or a referral bonus. To continue offering them advertisements like &quot;eBay shoes&quot; does not make much sense.",1403465601

Introduce an issue tracking system, or some kind of a queue, so that you can handle those problems asynchronously.<p>Are those messages immediate bug fix requests? Fixing bugs should eliminate them over time. If they are not, you are not doing it right. Introduce test driven development, rewrite code.

Introduce decision making guidelines. Possibly with some examples how they were applied in the past.<p>Clients asking the same questions repeatedly? Create a FAQ or some Help. I made a policy for myself once to always just answer client requests with links to the Help. If I could find answers in the Help, I linked them, otherwise I added them to the Help first.

(Sidebar: the pay was actually better initially when they first called me at $105K, but then they called me the next day and told me they had made a mistake and dropped it down to $90K...even though that really ticked me off, I ended up accepting anyway because it was still a pretty awesome opportunity for a small-town guy like myself to work for a big company like eBay).<p>I&#x27;m pretty risk averse so while I was there I was looking at a number of things, such as benefits (health / retirement), longevity / raise opportunities in the future, rent prices, work enjoyment etc. (looking at some of the comments people have made related to doing stuff in your 20&#x27;s versus your 30&#x27;s...I&#x27;m in my mid-20&#x27;s but I probably act as risk-averse as a 40 year old). Even more so now that I&#x27;m married with a little one (and a bun in the oven).<p>Even though in $$ I was making considerably more, once I included the increased cost of rent in to live in San Jose (versus Imperial County, CA), I actually didn&#x27;t seem to be making a whole lot more. Plus, I didn&#x27;t quite feel like I had the same amount of responsibility / enjoyment out of the work I was doing compared to the projects I was able to direct / build at my old job.<p>So shortly after starting at eBay, when I found out my old job was getting upgraded into a management position (primarily due to the inability to upgrade a &quot;regular&quot; position to a higher salary) I opted to go back, even though my new salary would be a bit less than the eBay one ($80K) overall it&#x27;d be a decent jump since my overall costs were the same.<p>Since then, I&#x27;ve been able to complete all of those projects I came back to finish, along with a slew of new ones that have come up since then, but at the same time, I&#x27;ve had to start letting go of some of my development duties and replace them with management ones (mainly because my staff are non-developers...I&#x27;m really the only one handling online services and my other staff handle printing, publications/copying, and mail duties for the campus). It&#x27;s been enjoyable, but at the same time I still want to become a better developer and it gets harder to do that at work now (and as someone else has mentioned, free time starts dwindling too).<p>Recently, after staying at the same salary for about two years, the management pay scale at the college was revamped, and as a newer manager I was able to receive a sizable increase because of it to my current salary of about $89K. For where I live that sort of salary is hard to find (i.e. it&#x27;s damn near impossible).<p>Fast-forwarding to today, I like to keep my eye out for jobs (either in Craigslist or in the Who&#x27;s Hiring threads each) in the Bay Area or closer, in San Diego, that would offer the &quot;full package&quot;: a great location, environment / team, salary and while I&#x27;ve seen a few good options, it seems the most difficult thing to get across in an email or resume is demonstrating how much of an asset I could be as an employee.<p>I&#x27;m not really complaining (things are definitely in the good-great range currently) but I&#x27;m always looking for additional opportunities to continue learning and become better at writing software (and being able to focus on that full-time again would definitely be great, and I could still bring my additional skills as an entrepreneur/manager to the table).<p>In the meantime, I went ahead and scraped our local Chamber of Commerce websites and sent out some old-fashioned snail mail letters to local businesses asking if there were any pain points or tasks that take up a lot of employee time that could potentially be automated or solved with software. I figure if I can get some interesting projects out of that it would be worth it and give me an enjoyable coding project to work on that solved a problem. So far, I&#x27;ve only received one response from a local liquid fertilizer / trucking company so after finishing this message I&#x27;m going to go take a closer look at the info that business provided me on Friday to see what I can do for them :-).<p>P.S.

Torch7 is what is being used for deep learning R&D at NYU, at Facebook AI Research, at Deep Mind, and at Google Brain.<p>(At Facebook) We are using Torch7 for many projects (as does Deep Mind and several groups at Google) and will be contributing to the public version. We are using Torch for most of our research projects (and some of our development projects) at Facebook. Deep Mind is also using Torch in a big way (largely because my former student and Torch-co-maintainer Koray Kavukcuoglu sold them on it). Since the Deep Mind acquisition, folks in the Google Brain group in Mountain View have also started to use it.<p>Facebook, NYU, and Google/Deep Mind all have custom CUDA back-ends for fast/parallel convolutional network training. Some of this code is not (yet) part of the public distribution.<p>The huge advantage of LuaJIT over Python is that it way, way faster, leaner, simpler, and that interfacing C/C++/CUDA code to it is incredibly easy and fast.<p>Torch is maintained by Ronan Collobert (IDIAP), Koray Kavukcuoglu (Deep Mind. former s=PhD student of mine) and Clément Farabet (running his own startup. Also a former PhD student of mine). We have used Torch as the main research platform in my NYU lab for quite a while.<p>You could say that Torch is the direct heir of Lush, though the maintainers are different. Lush was mostly maintained by Leon Bottou and me. Ralf Juengling took over the development of Lush2 a few years ago.\n</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://fastml.com/yann-lecuns-answers-from-the-reddit-ama/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fastml.com/yann-lecuns-answers-from-the-reddit-ama/</a>",1403464302

If you want to get higher offers you need to have been promoted to the next job level.<p>As an example, if you are a junior software engineer, you can only earn more as a senior software engineer, and again as a project manager, and again as a product / line manager.<p>And the only way you get promoted to the next band is by staying for a set amount of time at a company to get promoted. Outright offers from a lower job level to a higher one is rare without demonstrated ability to do the job.<p>So yes over the short term, jumping ship often is more lucrative, but you&#x27;ll hit a glass ceiling and have difficulty breaking through to the next level.",1403463612
