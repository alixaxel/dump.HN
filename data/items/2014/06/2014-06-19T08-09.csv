7915263,comment,7914786,7914786,1,0,alandarev,,,"Hello Ian. I am glad to see fruition of your ideas. (We had an interview, I was a guy with Russian accent, Jevgenij).<p>The site looks great, I enjoyed viewing it on mobile even mroe than on Desktop. Now to the observations:<p>1. I would try to reach billforward.com domain owner to purchase it, if you have not tried. .net, while it is popular and the purpose somehow fits (.net - network infrastructure services), I fear 1-5% of customers will be lost due to accidentally typing .com, or simply feeling that if a company is on .net, it might not be as credible as it claims.<p>2. <a href=""http://imgur.com/g6KQ3FP"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/g6KQ3FP</a> - it is zoomed out, initially the background would fit the screen, but the &quot;Tiered, tiered volume ...&quot; phrase was cut.<p>3. Pricing choice shall attract enough customers to further improve the product. Great idea for fast expansion, but is risky in terms of revenue. I assume, your bet is that many startups going for free, will eventually cross the bracket and start paying 1%.<p>4. Lack of application screenshots, some would like to look at the product itself before trying.<p>5. Billing services are obviously critical for any business, some statements and justifications of uptime, robustness and integrity would be very much welcoming.<p>Great job on explaining what the product is about right in the beginning. And as vijayaggarwal mentioned, call to action is well placed indeed, reminding that there is essentially no risk to try out.<p>Out of personal curiosity, do you mind sharing what technologies the product is built on?",1403168333

7915254,comment,7914571,7914571,3,0,ssdfsdf,,,"While I think the hypergraph is a great data structure, and I agree graph rewrite rules, written as graphs have a lovely symmetry, this approach feels too low level to me. Sure you can have graphs representing both data and process ala &quot;To Dissect a Mockingbird&quot;, but it feels that this interesting interplay of data and process is sitting too high up in the hierarchy of structure, I think you want this happening at a very low level, giving more space for emergence (whatever that may be).<p>There is not enough symmetry, I think the correct solution to this problem is going to look obvious.\nI don&#x27;t think this is an engineering problem, I think it is a radical re-imagining of what intelligence is.\nMy hope is with reservoir computing.<p>I think what we need to do is a mashup of reward modulated hebbian learning and reservoir style techniques. We need to take a gigantic sledge hammer and smash apart the incoming stream of data, spray it as far across the space as possible and then linearly compose the pieces to construct something that looks right. Combine this with hebbian learning so that those mutated, fragmented, mutated pieces of the incoming object which are useful for the purpose of the device are made more likely to occur within the network.<p>So you need a structure where it is possible to enhance the probability of some perturbation of the data through some global learning rule. Then you need a way of bringing those pieces together to reconstruct either the object itself or an object of use. And you need lots of it, billions of active processing elements and trillions of sparse connections.<p>Just my rant, perhaps it will spark something in a mind elsewhere, just passing on the pieces of the puzzle that I have smashed apart in my head.\nPerhaps we need to flip this all around, the patterns come from the world, they take root in our head and use the substrate to evolve, before passing out into the world again. what an GAI needs to do is provide a place for these patterns to take root and evolve according to the GAI specific objective function...",1403168157

It could be that applying some configuration could improve startup performance for you, but general runtime performance of Passenger should be on par with a Unicorn solution.<p>Note that to use Unicorn you would have to configure an nginx instance that proxies for Unicorn. This is where Passenger shines, we already integrate with nginx so there&#x27;s no extra configuration or management overhead. Passenger is resilient so it will survive any crashes of your application and automatically respawn any failed processes.<p>edit: The configuration to make your Passenger perfect for dedicated single app servers is:<p><pre><code>    passenger_min_instances your_num_of_cpus;\n    passenger_max_instances your_num_of_cpus;\n</code></pre>\nYou can measure your performance and tweak the number, as long as they are equal passenger won&#x27;t be spawning and killing anymore, making your performance more reliable.",1403166960

7915186,comment,7914571,7914571,6,0,Udo,,,"If we&#x27;re talking AGI, here&#x27;s my problem:<p><pre><code>  [...] one also needs predicates or relations: things that have \n  truth values, and order terms. Thus, ‘greater then’ is a relation, \n  and ‘a>b’ is either true or false.  Relations can also be things like \n  IsA, HasA, BelongsTo, LivesIn, EmployedAt.\n</code></pre>\nIn a biological system, these predicates are encoded in the graph itself. This is important for two reasons. First, this dynamic predicate encoding contains by necessity a representation of <i>what the predicate actually means</i>. Second, this allows a graph relationship between predicates themselves, and thus it&#x27;s possible to learn new ones, abstract higher-level ones, or modify existing predicates.<p>Why do I think this is a problem? It&#x27;s clearly not relevant for AI tasks, but AGIs have to be general and self-organizing. Of course I do agree with the research consensus that we probably have to &quot;cheat&quot; by hardcoding certain things (brains do it too, afterall), but maybe tags for node relationships should not be predefined like that if you want a system that can reason freely.<p>The problem is of course one of practicality. If you want a system you can explicitly program from the outside, there has to be a set of predicates which both the programmer and the AI understand to mean the same thing. However, in doing so you&#x27;re putting a severe limit on the amount of self-organization a brain can perform. Natural systems are not like that.",1403166947

7915059,comment,7913558,7914790,8,0,quotemstr,,,"> Actually, there are big problems with strcpy_s and strcat_s. First, strcpy_s abort()s the process if there would have been an overflow, making it useless for most programs<p>aborting is correct: unexpected truncation is always a logic bug. Truncation can lead to unexpected behavior, so better to fail fast than to get into a state about which you probably haven&#x27;t reasoned. If you really want strlcpy-like truncation, use strncpy_s (which, unlike strncpy, acts sanely with respect to NUL termination and filling). Of course, on untrusted input copied into a fixed-size buffer, you should be using strncpy_s instead of aborting. Use the right tool for the job.<p>>  In VC++, numberOfElements is the size of strDestination. In the C11 spec, that parameter is the maximum number of bytes to copy into strDestination.<p>That&#x27;s not actually a distinction. The purpose of the function is to ensure that the code writes no more than numberOfElements bytes into strDestination. Both versions of the function do that.<p>Note that the wide character versions of these functions are both specified in number of <i>elements</i>. (So are the narrow character versions, but the difference in moot because sizeof(char) == 1).)<p>> If strlcpy/strlcat aren&#x27;t available on a target platform, I stick them them in a util.h/util.c, wrapped in #ifndefs.<p>Or you can use <a href=""https://slibc.googlecode.com/svn/api-doc/html/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://slibc.googlecode.com/svn/api-doc/html/index.html</a>",1403165692

7914980,comment,7914099,7914898,1,0,junto,,,"Having read the paper [1], the authors suggest the following as a solution to the API key conundrum:<p><pre><code>   To avoid the need of storing secret tokens on a mobile device, Facebook\n  leverages the presence of the official Facebook Android application on \n  Android devices. The Facebook SDK allows third-party applications to use \n  Android intents to proxy requests for user access tokens through Facebook&#x27;s \n  Android application, where the user is already authenticated. To retrieve a \n  user&#x27;s access token with the Facebook SDK, the Android application identifi\fer\n  of a third-party application must be registered on its Facebook application \n  settings page. This allows Facebook&#x27;s Android application to respond to the \n  third-party application&#x27;s access token request by verifying the application\n  identi\ffier in the intent to the one officially registered online. Only the \n  application identi\ffer is needed and no secret key is compromised since it \n  is retrieved at runtime. This technique relies on the robustness of Android \n  since the source of the Android intent is assumed not to be spoofable.\n</code></pre>\nDoes anyone have a clearer description of this process. I&#x27;ve now read this extract three times and I&#x27;m none the wiser.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/pubs/sigmetrics2014_playdrone.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~nieh/pubs/sigmetrics2014_playdro...</a>",1403165118
