If you take a look at the app - it&#x27;s free for now - you can see that it&#x27;s easy to use without bothering others in the theater. The Timer feature is the most obvious method of using the app unobtrusively, but there are also other ways, like simply memorizing the time/cue for the Peetime of choice and looking for it during a film. We try our best to make the &quot;cues&quot; as memorable as possible.<p>That being said, there&#x27;s nothing I can do to prevent, how to put this, less than considerate people from abusing the app.",1403470755

The article didn&#x27;t mention it and neither have any of the comments thus far so I thought it fair to name. If you would like to understand what &quot;flow&quot; is and how you can achieve it on a regular basis I encourage you to read it. This applies to individuals, groups, work and leisure.<p>The productivity gains seen from things such as Kanban, TDD, and CI/CD can be easily explained by the science of flow. I&#x27;ve given several conference talks on this and they&#x27;ve been well received (asked for encore presentations).<p>As a quick teaser, think about how CI or fast tests contribute to flow when in order to achieve flow these three criteria must be met:<p>1. The goal must be clear\n2. Feedback must be immediate\n3. There must be a feeling that our capability is balanced to the challenge at hand",1403470632

To study computation in a rigorous manner, a mathematical model of computation was necessary.  The more complex the model of computation, the more axioms you need.  Complex models with many axioms are more difficult to reason about but are not actually more powerful (since they are all equivalent...)  With a simple model of computation you can quickly build yourself  more user-friendly systems (such as demonstrating how Church Encoding works, then proceeding to use it instead of writing it all out every time).

You’ve got the little lambda function, a lambda character and that’s indicates the beginning of a function definition. you say this function takes a varia..uh argument called x.  The period denotes the beginning of the body of the function, and then whatever comes after the period is what is returned by the function. So this is an identify function here. Anything you give it, it returns back the same value. You have arguments,  well ok you have variables, and you have functions. That&#x27;s all you have in lambda calculus.  There is nothing else, but variables and functions. &quot;<p>Visual:\nThere is a title to the slide, &quot;λ-calculus&quot;.

I founded an agency with a friend in pursuit of greater creative freedom, but as it happens ten bosses (ie. clients) are somewhat more stressful than just the one. During those five years I barely saw my kids, worked most weekends and didn&#x27;t take holidays for the last three years at all.<p>We were mostly working with SME&#x27;s and trying to grow the company to a point where could score some bigger clients, on several occasions we very nearly did. We got behind in our taxes when some large projects got cancelled and ended up taking out a bank loan secured against ourselves personally. The quality of our work deteriorated as we took on anything and everything to make ends meet, to pay our expanding team, hoping our big break was just around the corner.<p>When I finally called it quits we were about £60k in debt, shared between three partners. Telling our employees we had to let them go was hard, but I was surprised at how well most of them took it (they actually felt bad for me), to my relief all of them found employment again within a few weeks. I kept on working with my clients myself by working in evenings and weekends finishing everything off, it took about a year to shut down entirely, but every month it got a little easier. Our clients expressed some annoyance but they were mostly understanding. A couple even said that they didn&#x27;t know where they could find another agency as good to work with as us, which was heartening.<p>The successful agencies I have witnessed experiencing fast growth never had any small/medium clients; their founders worked for a larger company and took some big clients with them, or they worked client side and their previous employer became their first big client. Either way their initial clients were huge and there was very little of the painful bootstrapping I experienced, so if you don&#x27;t have big clients now expect a tough slog (or a lucky break of course, but counting on that pretty much gambling with your own time)<p>The whole experience cost me about £20k in debt and maybe £200k in lost earnings over what I would have been making had I been freelancing instead. It&#x27;s been a year and a half and I&#x27;ve managed to pay back my debts and finally get a mortgage on a house, that, had I not started a company I could very nearly have bought outright by now. The time I should have spent with my kids is lost (I fooled myself that I was doing it for them, but in retrospect really it was more of a &#x27;we&#x27;ve come this far...&#x27; mentality) but I&#x27;m trying to make it up to them now as best I can.<p>My advice to you would be to freelance, as a programmer you can work all around the world, remotely if you please and get paid decent money (We all know guys who only work part the year, and spend the rest travelling, others who work remotely from Bali or something). I&#x27;m freelancing now and I feel more free than I ever did running a company.",1403467792

7929012,comment,7928687,7928687,25,0,icambron,,,"My guess from here is that it&#x27;s not some sort of deep crisis, just a buildup of pain points that&#x27;s gotten up to your neck. If you can get a few things sorted out, the picture might turn nice and sunny, and your &quot;but I just want to RELAX!&quot; ennui will vaporize. But if you don&#x27;t sort them out, you&#x27;ll burn out, let everyone down, and be miserable. Remember: having a lot of clients is supposed to be a problem you want, but you need to make sure you&#x27;re equipped to handle it.<p>Here&#x27;s my advice from having burned out terribly and repaired it:<p>Take tomorrow off. Send the email out right now: &quot;Guys, I need a personal day. I&#x27;m sure you can handle it.&quot; Sleep in. Watch some TV for like half the day. Whatever.<p>The problem is likely that you&#x27;ve been hill-climbing. What&#x27;s the next problem and how do I solve it? The hill gets steeper as you go up, but you haven&#x27;t had the time to find a better path up, or maybe even a different hill. What you&#x27;ll need to do is take a step back and ask, what&#x27;s the problem with how we&#x27;re solving problems, and to do that, you need to hit the pause button on everything. That&#x27;s the real reason you just took tomorrow off. So after you&#x27;re done with TV...<p>Part of your job is to create sustainability. Working like crazy just isn&#x27;t sustainable and if you burn out, you&#x27;re not likely to be the only one. Fuck toughness; it&#x27;s not even a thing. And fuck the superheroics, because people just don&#x27;t scale. You&#x27;re not trying to lift a huge mountain yourself or even with a couple of your buddies; you&#x27;re trying to build an organization that will systematically take apart the mountain and ship it off in modular containers. How do you turn &quot;I need to make 1000 decisions today!&quot; into that?<p>1. Delegation. Make a list: why does your phone blow up all day? &quot;People need me to make decisions.&quot; What kind of decisions? &quot;Feature decisions, customer-support decisions, technical decisions...&quot; How can you delegate each of those? &quot;Well, I can make Jill my lead engineer and direct technical...&quot; You get it. Actually, just read this: <a href=""http://sivers.org/delegate"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sivers.org/delegate</a>. You probably think only you can make the decisions. You&#x27;re probably wrong and people will surprise you with their ability to take this stuff on, especially with your guidance. And if they can&#x27;t, fire them (seriously, this isn&#x27;t optional).<p>2. Operationalization. With delegation comes operationalization. You always have to be careful with process, but you also need to create it. When a new problem comes up, don&#x27;t just solve it. Create a process for solving it and then apply it. This doesn&#x27;t have to be the all-singing, all-dancing Ultimate Process (TM); it just has to be a way to solve this particular problem for the next, say, couple of months. &quot;How do we structure customer meetings?&quot; &quot;When do we give them updates?&quot; &quot;How do we structure projects?&quot; What&#x27;s nice about process is that it applies DRY to your thinking; the process guides your (and everyone else&#x27;s) decisions so your brain doesn&#x27;t have to.<p>3. Brutality. This is the hard one. A small company needs focus. Focus is at, like, the top of the list for attributes you&#x27;re after. So you need to look carefully at the portfolio of <i>stuff</i> you&#x27;re doing and ask, &quot;Do we really need to be doing this? Is it essential to our existence?&quot; You (and whoever else really has to be in this conversation) need to answer it without blinking. It&#x27;s hard to turn down clients, or cool ideas, or whatever, but you have to, because there will always, always be more stuff to do than you can plausibly handle. So you have to cut out all of that stuff, and you need to do it brutally and unflinchingly. &quot;We&#x27;re not doing that.&quot; Once you kill all the extraneous projects, even the ones that are making you money or publicity or whatever, you&#x27;ll feel so much better.<p>4. Expectation-setting. Your developers want to work really hard, but that&#x27;s actually not as great as you think it is. There&#x27;s a tendency for employees in a small company to match the culture around them, especially when those employees are young. (I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s where my twenties went.) But it doesn&#x27;t make them magical animals; they&#x27;ll burn out too. It&#x27;s your job to create the environment of sustainability. That starts with your client relationships and moves down into your development schedule, your individual expectations for work hours, etc. You need to make the expectations explicit. Never ever (ever!) say &quot;whatever it takes&quot; and don&#x27;t allow your employees to say; say, &quot;here&#x27;s what we can do&quot;, where &quot;what we can do&quot; fits into a reasonable schedule with reasonable hours. Will you lose some deals? Of course.<p>5. Planning. &quot;um we have 8 pages left to design for tomorrow, nobody is going anywhere&quot; is the opposite of planning. How did you get here? Well, you took on work without planning for it. That&#x27;s going to cause you all kinds of stress, because it&#x27;s crazy and humans can&#x27;t work that way. Planning would have allowed you to say, like two weeks ago, &quot;well, we&#x27;re not going to make that deadline, so let&#x27;s talk to the client and push that out.&quot; But instead, it&#x27;s the day before it&#x27;s due and you&#x27;re fucked. So the first thing you do, on Tuesday when you&#x27;re back is get a nice solid list of your existing commitments and see if they fit in a schedule. They won&#x27;t, so then you&#x27;ll have to reorganize some stuff and have some tough conversations about what to cut or push back or outsource or whatever. But holy shit will you feel better when you have. Then create a planning process going forward.<p>6. Supply and demand. Do you have too many clients for you to handle? Charge more. Seriously. The work will select itself for more value for you. If people keep wanting to pay, keep raising your price until they don&#x27;t. You&#x27;ll have  less work and at least as much money.<p>Whatever you do, don&#x27;t say, &quot;let&#x27;s just get through this last couple of things and then we&#x27;ll be in the clear&quot;. You should know by now that&#x27;s wishful thinking, and wishful thinking is, frankly, what got you into this mess in the first place. You need to take responsibility now and reorganize your team and process for sustainability.",1403467667

7928993,comment,7925162,7928575,1,0,logicallee,,,"I don&#x27;t really understand.  The argument is just that you can do something to increase the probability of guessing the bigger number from being anything other than exactly, precisely 1/2.<p>For example the author suggests that you first randomize which envelope you choose first.<p>Then you open that envelope.  You then flip a coin a number of times that matches the integer in the envelope, and if comes up all heads, then you choose the other one; otherwise you stop on the first one.<p>Obviously if the numbers are anything other than tiny integers, e.g. if they&#x27;re more htan 20 or so, then for all practical purposes it is impossible that it will come up all heads, e.g. 7,342 times in a row.<p>But in a rigorous, exact way, that probability is not exactly 0.  The probability of that many heads is lower for 7,342,352,454,356,234,753,343 than it is for 454,356,234,753,343 (where I truncated a bunch of digits) or even for 7,342,352,454,356,234,753,342 (where I changed the trailing 3 to a 2).  Therefore, you are more likely to stay on 7,342,352,454,356,234,753,343 than either of those other numbers.<p>This is purely academic.  Clearly, the chances of flipping heads 7,342,352,454,356,234,753,343 times in a row is so, unbelievably 0 it isn&#x27;t even funny.  But it&#x27;s not actually zero, mathematically speaking.<p>So essentially, you have a greater chance of swapping if the number is smaller, because there is a greater chance that you will flip all heads - even if &quot;greater chance&quot; just means 1 in 2^7,342,352,454,356,234,753,343 instead of 1 in 2^7,342,352,454,356,234,753,344 chance.<p>Do you not agree with this?<p>Or would you still say that it&#x27;s 50:50 that you will stay on 7,342,352,454,356,234,753,343  or stay on 7,342,352,454,356,234,753,344 (I changed just the trailing 3 to a 4) even if when you draw 7,342,352,454,356,234,753,343 you change your mind 1 out of 2^7,342,352,454,356,234,753,343  times and if you draw a 7,342,352,454,356,234,753,344 you change your mind 1 out of 2^7,342,352,454,356,234,753,344 times?<p>Would you consider the probability &quot;the same&quot; of holding on each one?<p>Or would you agree that in this particular example it is no longer 50:50 exactly, precisely.  If you agree with me that it&#x27;s not technically (pedantically) the same exact probability, then I am not understanding your argument exactly.<p>If you just meant that &quot;for all practical purposes&quot; the probability is the same - then of course I agree with you whole heartedly.
