7956609,comment,7945084,7947623,1,0,malandrew,,,"Furthermore, what is the impact here on memory usage when something fundamentally ephemeral like an AJAX request is declared in the DOM as a web component?<p>If I instantiate a new XHR request in a function scope, the XHR request object gets allocated on the heap. I then typically bind callbacks to the events I care about within the same scope. Again, all are added to the heap because that&#x27;s how mutable objects are allocated in JavaScript. That function scope eventually returns freeing the variable reference to that XHR object on the stack for that function scope. This XHR object will eventually be available to be garbage collected once all the bound events are fired and the callbacks execute and return. At this point the results have been passed on to their destination and no references should (ideally) remain pointing to the instantiated XHR object. The next time the GC sweeps, it can (theoretically) de-allocate the memory assigned for the XHR request and the memory for the event-bounded callbacks.<p>With the approach above however, the XHR request is instantiated via a web component and a reference is held indefinitely until either the window is terminated/refreshed or the `polymer-ajax` element is removed from the DOM. I suspect that not only will the memory for the XHR object never be freed, but neither will the memory allocated to the anonymous or named functions bound to the events, since internally the XHR object may still hold a reference to these callbacks (unless the implementation of XHR in question specifically nullifies the reference to callbacks that will never be called again).<p>We&#x27;re basically now back at having developers unknowingly performing malloc() in a declarative XML-based syntax, and they are now required to perform free() manually via the removeChild() method on the parent DOM element if they want to get that memory back.",1403909031

For example if you want to figure out education one of the extremes would be one teacher per student, other extreme would be the top minds in the field create a single class online and teach it to everyone together (Everyone gets same material, as opposed to different material per student in first case). You immediately see what is different between two, second one enables way to collaboration and idea swapping between students at the cost of face to face to face teaching and individual attention each student receives. In this context you can think of how many students can each of the extremes support.<p>2. I think analogies are a way of simplifying problem so that you can model it. People usually do it by assigning actors that they have experience with to the models, but that is not necessary. So if we model education as knowledge transfer between actors we can look for other concepts that share similar models.<p>3. Bad examples are a problem, I have nothing on this one. It might be mitigated by the fact, that on average some people will get good examples and succeed, but that feels like a non-argument.<p>4. Good point on historical factors, they are still useful to help pinpoint what kind of factors are affecting problem you are thinking about.<p>5. I think point of thought experiments is to try to come up with an obvious flaw in your experimental setup. Knowing those potential flaws would help you to set up controls in real experiment.<p>Not everyone is going to succeed in understanding big problems such as education system anywhere close to accurate. Even fewer people will be able to do anything with their understanding. I do not think that is the problem, as long as people try some will make it. I do know for sure that if you do not try, you will definitely never make it.",1403908701

One studio just had their own similar script written. He never sold the script, and when the movie actually came out no one was interested because it was too similar to the (essentially stolen) version that had been produced. Could he have sued the studio if he could prove it was his idea? How similar would it have to be?

(If the adverse action and condition are related, e.g. &quot;I&#x27;ll sue you if you wrong me&quot;, then it&#x27;s not extortion. &quot;I&#x27;ll expose your affair unless you give me $100,000&quot; is extortion because there&#x27;s no connection between the affair and demand for payment, and because the extortionist derives no benefit from exposing the affair.) It&#x27;s not illegal to write bad reviews of a restaurant, but if you demand a price discount and threaten a bad review, you can be found guilty of extortion. So &quot;I&#x27;ll write a bad review if you don&#x27;t give me a discount&quot; might be truthful-- you can lawfully do so, and even have this intent (intent being impossible to prove)-- but you still can&#x27;t say it.<p>This comes up in severance negotiations. If you say, &quot;I&#x27;ll [legal adverse action X, such as disparaging the company] unless given $Y&quot;, it&#x27;s very easy to end up on the wrong side of the law. You probably won&#x27;t end up in jail, but you lose all leverage as soon as you make a mistake, which is easy to do. If you&#x27;re negotiating for severance, you should always let a lawyer do it. It&#x27;s also a lot easier to get &quot;soft&quot; terms (positive reference, right to represent oneself as employed, possibly without pay) because those are connected to adverse actions. If you&#x27;re getting a bad reference, you do have cause to get out in front of the smear and disparage the company. (&quot;We have to get our stories straight. It&#x27;s best for both of us. Here&#x27;s what I want, and here&#x27;s what you get.&quot;) But if it&#x27;s about cash severance, the payment and your disparagement are unrelated enough that it&#x27;s best avoided.",1403907411

However, as CEO of my company I can make decisions that are not optimized for profit such as to keep a great employee and retrain them into a new position or at least to continue paying them till they find a similar position. 3) True - If I did this for ALL positions the company would fail to keep up with the market.
