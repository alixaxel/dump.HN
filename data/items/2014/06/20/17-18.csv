This is true, however, the population has grown since then and we are still about 7 million jobs short [0]. Also, the labor department includes, as said in the OP, underemployment. Typically you then have to work more jobs or live much less high on the hog. This is in addition to the older workforce continuing to stay in their positions.<p>I have an anecdote on this as well. My brother used to work for Lockheed. Many times, an expert would retire with no replacement in the free world to step up. They would then need to hire the expert back again for a much inflated price. The cows recently came home for that particular plant, as this last year all 4000 employees were fired.

True, to a degree, I suppose, but <i>whoever this Tim Bray guy is</i> adds some pretty important context. He co-authored the XML spec and was director of web technologies at Sun. You know, the people who made Java and promoted it as a web technology. Going out on a limb here, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to me that the man is a Java newbie.<p>The point of Bray&#x27;s rant, I&#x27;d suggest, is that these tools largely haven&#x27;t gotten any easier since 2004. It frequently seems to be controversial in these parts to assert that it&#x27;s worthwhile to make developer tools easy to use (&quot;what you&#x27;re complaining about is <i>obviously</i> easily addressed by whipping together something with bash, awk and sed and therefore isn&#x27;t a pain point at all, you whiner&quot;), which has always vaguely irritated me.

7921853,comment,7916160,7919208,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Edit: however, my original point regarding the opinion was, the SC did not just say this fails 101 because it&#x27;s not new, but they went on to say that &quot;long prevalent&quot; practices (i.e. prior art) can make something &quot;abstract&quot;. This, to me, simply makes no sense.<p>In what I&#x27;ve seen of the Supreme Court jurisprudence on patent-eligibility, &quot;abstract idea&quot; <i>seems</i> to have (based on the way it is used, not any explicit statement) evolved into a sort of a term of art for things that fail both the &quot;new and useful&quot; and &quot;process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter&quot; requirements of Section 101.<p>I would say that this is one of the ways in which case law gets unnecessarily and confusingly self-referential and loses its visible connection to the underlying enactments that it is interpreting, which makes it less accessible and avoidably opaque.

Similarly, ML developers can create their own forward application ( |> ) operator to also get good access to a useful feature that isn&#x27;t included by default.<p>In languages that don&#x27;t allow you to overload operators at all, the alternative is to use explicit function syntax.  That can sometimes be a short path unreadable to code that&#x27;s littered with pyramids of doom.<p>In languages that only allow you to overload existing operators, you end up with monstrosities like C++&#x27;s << and >> operators, which overload the bit-shift operators with new and completely unrelated semantics.

And the risk isn&#x27;t nearly as severe as jumping in a volcano. A more relevant analogy might be &quot;Would a company commit tax fraud on the order of a million dollars and risk being caught&quot; (yes many have) or &quot;would an executive steal from the company he works at and, when they notice, cut and run.&quot;<p>Your theoretical for what happens on a 51% attack is also silly. There would be signs of some attacks (like consistent double spending on high-confirmation things), but other attacks like extortion-for-inclusion could be silent for as long as the victims don&#x27;t speak up. Furthermore, people wouldn&#x27;t leave overnight.. not that many did when GHash performed attacks the last time. In addition, people are highly unlikely to change. Things won&#x27;t drop off over night. They weren&#x27;t DDOSed last time. Your entire speculation is optimistically assuming there won&#x27;t be significant doubt and inertia... and betting against human lazyness is rarely a good idea.<p>Finally, you assume GHash is left with nearly worthless bitcoins. Well, sort of. The extortion could lead to them being paid in anything. If the entire company decided to do an attack they&#x27;d obviously sell all bitcoins first so any new bitcoins gained through any attack would be pure profit (and wouldn&#x27;t be worthless for at least several hours until someone notices and news spreads). Furthermore, each employee of GHash that is capable of causing such an attack to occur might not have any bitcoins, even if GHash does.<p>I think that your defense of GHash is flawed, especially considering they&#x27;ve behaved badly in the past. and your arguments in general aren&#x27;t strong.<p>I see it as fully plausible that if they maintain 51% hashing power for an extended period of time, a bad employee might modify their code for their own profit and then GHash will plead ignorance when it&#x27;s discovered and carry on. I also see it as fully plausible that if GHash decides to close shop at over 51% they&#x27;ll choose to go out with a bang and do what thievery and damage they can on the way out.<p>I fully agree with the article that this is a problem.",1403283630
