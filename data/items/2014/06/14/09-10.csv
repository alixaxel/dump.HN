7892465,comment,7892430,7892430,2,0,ColinWright,,,"Repeating here the relevant section from my comment earlier[2]:<p>The idea is that there are only so many small numbers, and there are lots of ways of combining things together. The Pigeonhole Principle then says that if you stuff too many things into a small enough space, some of them will be close together. Although apparently obvious, this is more widely applicable than people generally realize. It&#x27;s used, for example, in one of the proofs that that every prime of the form 4k+1 is expressible as the sum of two squares (Examples: 29=4x7+1=5^2+2^2, 181=4x45+1=10^2+9^2).<p>Combine this with the birthday problem/paradox[0][1], and you end up with more coincidences than you might expect.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1312636"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1312636</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4753014"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4753014</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7892425"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7892425</a>",1402739338

7892463,comment,7892169,7892169,5,0,mtdewcmu,,,"I think there are some good, sound principles here; I&#x27;ve dealt with some to one extent or another, and I couldn&#x27;t find anything to disagree with. I worked on a port of a large Java application to C++ on a different platform, and we went back and forth for a while trying to choose between utf-8 and utf-16 as a standard character encoding. We ultimately settled on utf-8, even though the Java code had used utf-16 (because it&#x27;s Java&#x27;s native encoding); I&#x27;m not surprised to read here that utf-8 is the way to go. Utf-16 is at odds with the expectations of every C and C++ standard library function and the language itself, which would have been a source of annoyances that would never end.<p>It&#x27;s very, very hard to make any generalization about programming, and so I suspect that in his confident pronouncement that cross platform should never add more than a small amount of time to a project, there is something he&#x27;s ignoring. The application they sell is for backup, and so it would probably be close to ideal for making cross-platform. I think he underestimates how complex GUI code can get when dealing with requirements less trivial than a backup application.<p>He also basically ignored Macintosh and ObjectiveC. I don&#x27;t recall what the state of Macintosh was at the time this piece was written, but I&#x27;m pretty sure ObjectiveC was the standard language on Mac then as it is now.<p>I think there are sage principles here, though.",1402739286

But they usually increase battery size and get a more powerful (therefore more efficient with high resolutions) GPU, to mask that. That&#x27;s how a 1440p phone can get the same, or almost the same battery life as a phone with 720p screen and a significantly smaller battery.<p>Now the question that most OEMs don&#x27;t seem to ask themselves is - how much better would the battery life be, if they kept the old &quot;standard&quot; resolution, and increase the battery life and used a new GPU, too? It could be up to 50 percent longer.<p>Not to mention that focusing on resolution, and making the screen more expensive <i>that way</i>, takes away from them focusing on other aspects of the screen, such as viewing angles (there was a comparison around between LG G3 and Galaxy S5 viewing angles, which I can&#x27;t find now, but LG G3 viewing angles were pretty bad).<p>Focusing on <i>needlessly</i> expensive higher resolution screens also takes component money away from investing in even better cameras, more storage, and so on. For example, instead of paying $70 for a 1440p display, they could be paying $50 for a 1080p one (which are pretty abundant now), and get a $40 camera sensor instead of a $20 one.

I have literally seen elementary school kids argue over who gets to be the next one to solve equations playing it.<p>If you have an iOS or Android tablet, they also have a new game called DragonBox Elements up that teaches geometry. After playing it for a while, I&#x27;d see triangles everywhere.<p>If DragonBox gets them hooked on algebra, another fun algebra game is Algeburst (currently only available for iOS platforms AFAIK), which employs a basic get-three-of-the-same-color-in-a-row mechanic, but requiring you to interpret simple algebraic expressions in order to figure out which tiles are of which color. E.g. if there&#x27;s a tile called 3X + 2X, you can recognize it as being a 5X tile and give it whatever color 5X tiles happen to have on that particular level. (I was only going to try this game to see whether it was any good, but then ended up losing several hours to it.) They also have a &quot;topics in arithmetic&quot; version which doesn&#x27;t have algebra but rather focuses on basic arithmetic.<p>10 might be getting a little old for it, and it teaches the basics of programming not math, but in general I would also recommend the Robot Turtles board game.
