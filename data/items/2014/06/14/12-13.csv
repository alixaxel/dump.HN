Not because it&#x27;s &quot;designed&quot; or &quot;rigged&quot; but because privacy is not something they value?<p>Humans lived in small groups, then villages pretty much until yesterday, easily for most of our species&#x27; history (99%+ of ~200k years). People knew everything about each other. And then gossiped to make sure nothing went unnoticed.<p>Contrary to the article, we probably still reveal less than we used to. People would bathe in semi-public places. That&#x27;s not common outside of vacation spots any more.<p>Yes, advertisers bank on our nature. Gossip blogs bank on it. But they didn&#x27;t make us that way.<p>OK, so the nature of information collection changed but we don&#x27;t feel it. Some people can rationally appreciate it but not casual Internet users. And most nightmare scenarios are still hypothetical.<p><i>Imagine being subject of public hate because you expressed a unpopular view when you were young.</i><p>Many people, even here, are fine with that.

It&#x27;s a book based on current experimental research in psychology, but it has had some good editing to be a readable, interesting popular book that will reliably prompt you to think about aspects of your thinking you perhaps have not thought about recently. (I&#x27;m reading the book right now, which is why this comes to mind.) I think reading <i>Mindwise</i> just might help you understand yourself better, understand your significant other better, understand your co-workers better, and understand the group dynamics on Hacker News better, and anyway it&#x27;s fun to read.<p>[1] <a href=""http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/nicholas.epley/html/Mindwise.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/nicholas.epley/html/Mindwise...</a>",1402749621

As an added benefit, this also made the JSON responses way lighter.<p>The main problem I see with the pg_trgm approach is that it would only return domains that exist in the database (or in the zone files) and thus they would have to be registered, which totally defeats the purpose of the tool.

Have a successful startup? Million dollars? Improve the lives of others?<p>Sure. But why? What&#x27;s behind it? We like to look for an objective meaning in things, but what is meaning other than the belief in a cosmic points system that will bestow rewards upon us if we play our roles right?<p>Whether you are a startup founder, career person, scientist, devout christian, philanthropist, volunteer or whatever makes no essential difference here - pretty much everyone chases some ill-defined ideal in the hope that somehow some ill-defined someone or something will save us and make everything alright when we reach some ill-defined goal.<p>And when you do succeed, what do you really have to show for it? Years of sacrifice gone that you&#x27;ll never get back, even more expectations than before, because now you&#x27;re supposed to act like a successful person, even more anxiety that you&#x27;ll disappoint the people who idolize you, eager to believe in the fairy-tale that you&#x27;ve made it and everything&#x27;s happily-ever-after-picture-perfect. Everyone has at least some stories of disappointment with success. Everyone knows people who do. Show me one happily ever after.<p>It&#x27;s a blind gamble with the only thing we do have - time, and we keep pissing that away because it&#x27;s easier than seriously asking the question that could shake the very foundation of the persons we believe ourselves to be and the reality we believe ourselves to live in.<p>Everything needs to be ill-defined, because otherwise we would see that it doesn&#x27;t make sense and couldn&#x27;t keep pretending that we&#x27;re doing something worthwhile while what we&#x27;re actually doing is killing time waiting for death and imagining that there&#x27;s no hurry and someone&#x27;s coming to save us.<p>To seriously and honestly admit what you want is fucking hard. It&#x27;s a question that takes no prisoners. The very act of asking sets you apart from family, friends and society, forces you to see that in the things that matter to you most, you are in fact alone. For most of us considering an honest answer to that question amounts to what is commonly considered one of the greatest sins - being selfish.<p>We&#x27;re afraid of being selfish, we&#x27;re afraid of sinning against the people around us by rejecting their rules and desires, we&#x27;re afraid of being alone and we&#x27;re afraid of dying, so we keep playing our roles and pretending to everyone around us.<p>At the same time deep inside we know that nothing matters, we know that we&#x27;re all selfish by design, we know we have nothing to lose because we&#x27;ll all be gone soon anyway and we have a pretty good idea of what we want to do before we end up cancer-ridden in a hospice, smiling bitterly at the memory of what used to matter to us and the times when we could have lived but didn&#x27;t because we were too busy pretending we could hide from death.<p>My girlfriend just came in the room and glanced at my screen as I&#x27;m finishing typing this and for a second I was really terrified she&#x27;d see what I was writing.

It would be nice if someone had actually taken the time to write a proper blog post and explained and expanded on the points, but that&#x27;s happening here in this thread.<p>And it&#x27;s more relevant to computing, algorithms, statistics, and big data analysis than most people realize.  People have a tendency to see too much in coincidences, people don&#x27;t realize that there will be things that turn out to be equal, or nearly equal, more-or-less &quot;by accident.&quot;<p>So while you may think this is a low-quality submission, I think you are only half right, and I think it&#x27;s worth having.",1402747329
