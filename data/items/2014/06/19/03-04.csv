It doesn&#x27;t make Rails any more or less thread-safe -- the `thread_safe!` declaration is about you telling Rails that YOUR code is thread-safe, and thus it&#x27;s safe for Rails to allow overlapping concurrent requests to be processed, instead of forcing requests to be processed serially. (Still requires an app server that can dispatch requests concurrently, for it to actually happen. Basically puma or passenger enterprise).<p>But yes, in Rails 4 that&#x27;s the default mode, for Rails to allow concurrent overlapping requests. Meaning Rails 4 assumes by default that any local or gem code is thread-safe (may or may not be a safe assumption of course).<p>Both Rails 3.2 and Rails 4 (and really older Rails for quite some time) are intended and architected to be thread-safe. Modulo bugs. There were concurrency bugs in older versions for sure, which we know because so many of them have been fixed.",1403150398

This means I&#x27;ll not have to care about keeping an eye on my usage.<p>You&#x27;re correct about the actual change they made: letting me do something that&#x27;s comparatively low-bandwidth without it counting against my high-bandwidth concerns.

There&#x27;s no pressure or angle sensitivity in the FiftyThree Pencil, it&#x27;s just a button.<p>I tried to find the &quot;pressure&quot; API in iOS 8, but I just found a new majorRadius field (with an error tolerance).

So few people actually use Rails in a multi-threaded deploy environment -- and concurrency bugs can be so tricky -- that it would not surprise me if there are still some bugs hiding out.<p>There really is such a huge performance advantage to a multi-threaded deploy environment -- EVEN with MRI, for the typical I/O-bound webapp, although you&#x27;d definitely want both multi-process and multi-threaded  under MRI GIL. (Both puma and passenger enterprise can give you this, although not passenger free).<p>I&#x27;m hoping people start to catch on to this, and multi-threaded app servers get more popular, making them more mature and feature-rich, and in turn flushing out remaining bugs in Rails, causing yet more interest in multi-threaded deploy environment, virtuous circle blah blah",1403150211

7914363,comment,7914028,7914028,13,0,hibikir,,,"While I cannot judge how those practices work at Google, I have seen similar practices fail miserably when applied in smaller companies.<p>Opinionated best practices stop being useful when the emphasis is on opinionated and not on best. If the cabal that has political influence is not the strongest there is, standardization just increases how much technical debt can be built in a short period of time.<p>I have seen expenses on tools teams that went nowhere, for two reasons. The first is that tools teams are attractive to people that do not want to deal with customers, so they can attract the opinionated and antisocial. The other problem is that the generic tools really have to solve the problem very well: Lack the engineering quality in said tools team, and you are spending a bunch of money on infrastructure that will both fail to evolve at the speed of OSS, and get entrenched everywhere in your codebase.<p>Automated testing will only get you far if it is pragmatic. I have seen millions of dollars spent on test automation that was extremely fragile and never paid for itself, because it had an extremely short shelf life. Picking the wrong tools for it makes it even worse.<p>Code reviews can be great, or can be terrible. A code review searching for real problems in the code, or that really considers alternative solutions, will be very valuable. But code reviews can quickly become pissing contests used by people to impose their preferences on others: A passive aggressive way of asserting dominance on a team. You can see a lot of that in proponents of the 5 minute code review: No actual analysis of the code is done, but 5 minutes is plenty to use it as a tool for abuse.<p>So while the techniques described in the article can be very helpful, the wrong implementation of them will just help you standardize on a monoculture of bad engineering. So before implementing such things think about how good your engineering really is, and whether you really are better off making sure people bend to your standards, or you are better off learning from the experience of new people.

I&#x27;m not an expert on racism, but it would seem that racism does have positive attributes, especially for the &quot;in&quot; group - social cohesion first among them. I&#x27;d argue that the racist hole left in Americans, anyway, was filled with it&#x27;s opposite: tolerance. The only thing we don&#x27;t tolerate anymore is intolerance (which, BTW, is a very good change).<p>The &quot;shape&quot; of the hole left by religion is more complex. I suppose the best way to describe it would be to compare all extant religions and see what they have in common. My lay-opinion is that they almost all give the adherent two things: a) an almost Newtonian, absolutist world-view, in which b) some sort of father or mother figure that will make everything all right (in the long run). So, it&#x27;s a kind of certainty about one&#x27;s own personal insignificance. It&#x27;s an excuse to &quot;let go&quot;.<p>From this perspective, ignoring differences in specific dogma, religion is actually far more realistic than humanism, which usually tends to stress individual importance. But most people (and I include myself in this) are not important. Heck, think of any of the most important people in history - will they be remembered in 1000 years? 10,000? On an even somewhat long (human) time scale, almost none of us matter.",1403148599

Let&#x27;s say you are right and that I am right and there are 3 employees, and lets guess that they are sharing in say 80% of the &quot;equity&quot; but there shares are &quot;common&quot; not &quot;preferred.&quot; The employees and founders feel awesome! &quot;Look its worth $12M and we are millionaires!&quot; and they go about their business trying to make it more awesome and cool. Except they can&#x27;t make it more awesome enough and they need more money. The original investor says &quot;Oh sure, I&#x27;m in but I don&#x27;t want to lead this round.&quot; and the founders go out stumping for money, but they can&#x27;t find anyone who agrees with their original valuation much less an even higher one. What to do? what to do! And the money is running out, and there are people to feed and spouses or significant others who are getting worried. And the &quot;Blam!&quot; the investor mentions they could use an exit to his pal a BigCorp who offers to buy them out in an acqui-hire &quot;terms of the deal not disclosed&quot; and the founders are hired and given &#x27;earn out&#x27; packages that force them to work at BigCorp of 3 maybe 4 years, meanwhile our investor clears their liquidation preference, doubles (or maybe triples the cash) in their pocket and if they are participating preferred takes <i>another</i> bite at what ever is left over for the common stock.<p>Ok so all this evilness speculation speaks poorly for the folks who just invested $1.2M in Yo. Neither I nor probably anyone else really knows what they saw in the company to make them feel that they could get their money back, but it is critical to remember that investors are in it to make money, if the founders get some too that is a &quot;nice to have&quot; but isn&#x27;t essential. This lack of alignment gets sometimes missed when people like Jacques are wondering &quot;What the heck is going on here?&quot; An investor doesn&#x27;t care if its a &#x27;down round&#x27; if they are getting 2x their money back in under 5 years. Using the rule of 72[1], getting double your money in 4.8 years is a 15% rate of return.
