Just very quickly, (i) a CEO&#x27;s blog post itself is not legally binding on the company by nature, but it is a reflection of a corporate decision (typically the Board of Directors)behind the post. An action of this nature can only be challenged in court by the shareholders or dissenting board members in certain cases. (ii) a legal patent holder has every right of disposal over the patent, including the act of revoking it. (iii)I did not look for precedents for this but if a different company would re-issue Tesla&#x27;s designs on their own name and tried to sue Tesla (i.e. trolling), I have serious doubts concerning not only on whether such revoked patents can be re-issued in somebody elses name but also, assuming thats possible, any judge or court would award any penalties to the original patent author in such lawsuit.",1402639071

The &quot;confess-confess&quot; solution is the Nash equilibrium. You will always be better off screwing the other person over, whether they are honest or dishonest. The &quot;deny-deny&quot; solution is Pareto optimal. If both parties can somehow trust each other, they will both be better off selecting this solution.<p>This part is very confusing to me.  I&#x27;ve always understood that deny was the screw-over move in the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma.  But this segment suggests that confessing is a local optimum.

The &quot;success, but...&quot; scenario. Sometimes you have different types of failures to handle and this style conflates all of them into &quot;failure&quot;. For example, I want to WARN about something my caller; everything is OK, but there is something to be known (The call went fine, but the file was not there so I created it). Should information about that value be passed on the failure pipe? If I do so I lose the ability to do simple checks like &quot;if failure.empty?&quot;. A third pipe for &quot;warn&quot;? And another one for &quot;info&quot;? Mhhh...<p>2. There are different way to fail. There are cases in which you really should not go on with any computation, there are cases in which can go on, just note that you are in &quot;danger&quot; mode (ENOSPC).<p>3. What about transient failures? Should &quot;Network just went down&quot; be treated like &quot;Server returned HTTP 404&quot;.<p>4.

The Internet; The Web; Firefox, WebKit; GNU/Linux, Unix; HTTP; SSH, SSL, AES; Python, Ruby, C, C++.&quot;<p>The vast majority of those were not developed by an open bazaar, but rather by focused cathedral organizations:  the early Internet, UNIX, C, C++, SSH, Firefox, SSL.  The bazaar maintains them or cloned the success of others (SSH).<p>I also think you&#x27;re vastly underestimating the influence and power over millions that continues to exist from closed commercial software:  Apple iOS, IBM zOS, pOS, and DB2, SAP ERP, Oracle database, middleware, and various HR/SCM/CRM/ERP suites, Microsoft Office and Windows / IIS.   The big difference is that there is an order of magnitude more revenue and more people being paid to work with commercial software than with open source.<p>That you claim all serious servers run Apache or Ngnix on *nix is profoundly ignorant of the millions of Windows servers and IIS servers out there, some of which power very large websites.  I think Ngnix is a great server, but most of the large enterprises (banks,\nTelcos, etc) I&#x27;ve visted in my consulting run WebSphere or IIS and have never heard of HAproxy or Ngnix.<p>This is not to say this is a static state of affairs.  Certainly in many cases the open source alternative is a better technology or better project, sometimes even the better product.  Just there&#x27;s a big difference between an innovative PRODUCT and an innovative PROJECT.  There are lots of the latter on Github, but other than saving people some money, they&#x27;re not having anywhere the economic impact a PRODUCT has.<p>There is scant evidence that open source leads to more innovative products.  There&#x27;s a lot of evidence it helps to lower the acquisition costs of supporting software for what usually wind up as partly proprietary products.  All of the latest software kings: Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple, Salesforce, Google - their primary money making innovations are closed source built on (mostly non GPL) open source .  Their contributions of open componentry back to the community is welcome but limited.<p>The only large and &quot;purely&quot; open company is Red Hat, and even they go through major hoops to make it inconvenient for others (eg. oracle) to use their open source code for their own purposes  (ie. Offer a RHEL clone and loss lead on support).  They remain innovative.  But so is SAP.  So is Oracle.",1402636890

Yeah, every now and then you get someone with a conscience in charge of a big company, but if you&#x27;re going to rely on that you might as well just cut out the middleman and go straight to a &quot;benevolent&quot; dictatorship.<p>Oh, the other thing you missed is that most corpocracy scenarios (including the one that we&#x27;re actually living in) aren&#x27;t about corporations <i>standing up</i> to the government, but about them using money and influence to make sure that the government does what&#x27;s best for the corps instead of what&#x27;s best for the people. Giving the corps more power doesn&#x27;t create a balance, it just makes it easier for them to pull the puppet strings.",1402636301

This creates a feedback loop, resulting in bubbles and crashes.<p>A downward price trend encourages splurging, which provides excessive liquidity. This creates a feedback loop, resulting in Zimbabwe. Bitcoin opponents have a vested interest; the desire to attack something you missed out on due to your own lack of foresight is a known psychological effect. I don&#x27;t necessarily believe all of the above, but it&#x27;s a pretty symmetric mirror image of the opposite argument. You could go up a notch and make the case that inflation is worse because at least an upward bubble has to end eventually whereas a downward crash can keep going down forever until the currency is replaced. I&#x27;m known for my stance that finite supply cryptocurrency is probably more deflationary than optimal (though my concerns are more about wealth concentration and the potential for use of seignorage revenue for secondary purposes rather than some idea that spending is good), but there are good reasons why one might think otherwise.<p>As for gold, an important point is that gold&#x27;s volatility is quite recent. Before 1971, and especially before 1913, it was actually quite stable:<p><a href=""http://www.zerohedge.com/news/charting-price-gold-all-way-back-1265"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/charting-price-gold-all-way-ba...</a><p>Yes, that&#x27;s a 6x margin that maintained itself over six centuries. The 18th century fall and the 16th century fall can likely be attributed to the sudden introduction of new supply in North America; that&#x27;s an uncertainty that cryptocurrencies do not have. I don&#x27;t know why gold was stable before but is not now; perhaps it&#x27;s the fact that a fixed-supply commodity is stable if used as a currency but not stable if used as a form of black-swan insurance. The former use case might have more constant demand, or price stickiness might play a role.<p>I&#x27;m honestly not sure what will happen. Maybe cryptocurrencies will die, maybe BTC will die but others succeed, maybe BTC will become gold 2.0 and other currencies will take on other roles (if this happens, environmentalists at least would be quite happy given gold miners&#x27; current track record), or maybe something else entirely. I do agree one-world-currency domination is exceedingly unlikely though.",1402636181

Porosity represents the storage capacity of the geologic material. On the other hand, permeability is a measure of the ease with which fluids will flow though a porous rock. Although a rock may be highly porous, if the voids are not interconnected, then fluids within the closed, isolated pores cannot move. This situation is commonly found in nature and represents a challenge for the extraction or the injection in reservoirs.<p>Nevertheless, I have no idea of the porosity level that could exists at those depths.<p>2) At 700km depth pressures are of order 21 Giga Pascals (~207000 atmospheres) and temperatures about ~1900ºC.
