(For me) its &quot;what do I want to happen when things go horribly wrong?&quot;.<p>High level would be:\n- Payment terms.  Fixed price, with 50% deposit?  Time and materials?  Something else?\n- When will payment be made?  (End of month, +30 days after invoice submitted)\n- Just <i>what</i> are you delivering?  What do they get for their money?\n- What <i>aren&#x27;t</i> you delivering? (Out of scope)\n- What happens when there is a disagreement?  (Jurisdictions)\n- Who owns what?\n- Where is the work done (onsite / offsite).  What hours are you expected / agreeing to?<p>Depending on how big the project is, sometimes the above can be broken up into several documents.  This can help with negotiations.  Eg things like payment terms and jurisdictions can be in a &quot;Master Services Agreement&quot; type document.  While scope can be in a &quot;Scope of works&quot; type document.<p>You may want to split the document into expectations & actuals.  Expectations are your estimates (I estimate this piece of work will take xx hours / days / weeks / months) and actuals are the hard facts.  $1,000 per day / Invoices submitted fortnightly and paid within 14 days etc.<p>In the end, you really should consult a lawyer...",1401688785

They did offer that it was a concurrent raid along with Sven Jaschan (author of Sasser) and they thought there was potential for a tip-off.<p>I was cringing the whole time reading about the interrogation. I can imagine this whole thing would have ended <i>so</i> much worse for Gembe if he had actually gone for that job interview.

If you&#x27;re in UTF-8, it&#x27;s a 36 byte comparison.<p>That sounds, however, a lot like MySQL, which has perhaps one of the more braindead &quot;UTF-8&quot; implementations. That said, I&#x27;m not sure that it uses 3 bytes for code points that don&#x27;t require it.

PCI is a completely different ballgame than button clicks for example.<p>Increasingly, plenty of non-SaaS products work this way (e.g. Tesla cars, OnStar, your iPhone, apps in the Windows Store, etc.)  Again the question isn&#x27;t so much about &quot;whether&quot; to collect usage and bug reporting data, it&#x27;s about getting the defaults right and educating concerned users to tweak them to a level where they are more comfortable.<p>> also tells them that you think they&#x27;re so stupid that they don&#x27;t know the difference between a bug and a user error<p>This is literally the case that OP came to us to solve",1401688177

I will consider working for less if I consider your problems hard, interesting, and stimulating enough :P<p>I&#x27;m comfortable presenting to large groups, teaching, and I can accept roles that require some supervision, but I&#x27;m looking for flexibility and a mature/reasonable employer that wants me working for them because I can solve challenging technical/analytical/research problems that other people can&#x27;t.<p>I am gainfully employed with a professional working wife, so I won&#x27;t move without considering our combined situation and employment prospects, but we&#x27;re both interested in moving if its to a location that offers more opportunities or stimulation than Canberra.<p>If there&#x27;s anywhere with employers looking for people like me, willing to offer jobs that I might be interested in, I believe its probably on hacker news.",1401686106
