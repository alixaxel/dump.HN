7923978,comment,7922028,7923506,12,0,Aqueous,,,"Yes. I worked for a university briefly as a staff member. Our university sung far and wide about how it just raised $400 million for its endowment in its most recent fundraising campaign, and yet, it couldn&#x27;t afford to pay me more than a $25,000 salary in the IT department. How on earth is this possible? It&#x27;s probably in all the unseen costs they pay out in contracts to subcontractors. But another clue might be this: during the time of my employment, there were several ongoing, large construction projects.<p>Universities are obsessed with the rankings of US News. And for some reason, they feel that campus renewal and renovation construction projects are the secret to mastering them.  So instead of paying a decent wage to the people who actually comprise the &quot;college experience&quot; for their students, they pay outsized amounts to further improve their already glittering campus so that it looks better on the 15 minute admissions tour that prospective students take.<p>Somewhere the priorities are out of whack. I think if universities stopped spending so much money gaming the rankings, they might realize that paying their staff more and paying their faculty more would translate into a better, more involved college experience for their students. And that, in turn, would make their students evangelize to other prospective students about how much they love their college...<p>Improve the product, not the marketing.",1403319181

Keyword research: understand the search volume and competition level for each target keyword before you start your campaigns. Having an estimate of CPC before you start is critical to right planning. If you operate in an industry where search volumes are less and/or competition is high, you should perhaps not depend on search engine are your primary traffic source.<p>2. Contextual relevancy of keywords: the more relevant the keyword is, the lesser price you pay as you drive more CTR. Google charges lower CPC for higher CTR ads. SEO directly helps SEM.<p>3. Catchy headlines, good description: ad making is an art. Even text ads. Test multiple copies for each keyword group and see which one does best. See if having <i>FREE</i> in the heading helps, try adding phone number, etc. Again higher CTR implies lower CPC.",1403319024

It&#x27;s also not explicitly taught, but the skill of breaking up sequences of letters so that you&#x27;re typing complete <i>words</i> and common pieces of words (e.g. &quot;ing&quot;) is also very important. Fast, fluent typing comes from being able to quickly know which keys to hit for a given word - which finger exactly to use matters only tangentially.

Strangers coming home at 3am on a weekday (Mo-We), inebriated, slamming the doors waking us up and the kid as well, quite often with more raucous strangers in tow for a night cap. Strangers picked up in a bar of our &#x27;gentrifying&#x27; hood, who left at 5am after knocking back more beers and/or some boots.<p>I paid rent, for the joy of living in a virtual dorm, they collected monies while affecting my quality of life and safety.

We lived in that place for 13 years, 10 without problems, but the last 3 at times unbearable because of these &quot;good friends from Europe&quot;.<p>When we moved, our friendly neighbors across the hall, avowed AirBnB hosts (they came clean), suggested that we renew our lease one more year (rent stabilized) and put our apt. on AirBnB &quot;as a source of income&quot;. They would happily &quot;manage&quot; our AirBnB listing (key transfer, cleaning) for a piece of the pie. We declined, we liked our other neighbors too much...<p>With reports from Berlin, San Francisco and other cities showcasing how AirBnB has affected availability of apt&#x27;s and is one of the main drivers of rising rents ( eg see <a href=""http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/item/airbnb-san-francisco-30110.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sfchronicle.com/business/item/airbnb-san-francisc...</a> and <a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/1230/Berlin-squeezes-Airbnb-on-short-term-apartment-rentals"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2013/1230/Berlin-squee...</a> ) it&#x27;s about time something is done about this.<p>Let&#x27;s stop calling them social sharing companies, and just rename them &quot;loopholes&quot;, who make money by assisting others in breaking the law, violating the terms of their lease, and enabling tax evasion whilst denying any type of responsibility for &quot;sharing&quot; my quality of life to pieces...<p>Glad regulation is in the pipeline.

I was talking about programming languages that require 3-4x the code/boilerplate to write the same logic. For example, F# usually needs roughly half the lines and way less than half the characters than the equivalent C# code, assuming all the same variable and function names. Other examples are Scala, Haskell, Clojure, Go, or even lambdas and the Linq features of C#.

7923894,comment,7922266,7922266,2,0,throwawaykf05,,,"TFA boils down to the following points, and a lot of people are (rightfully) questioning it:<p><i>> The courts have repeatedly said that mathematical algorithms can&#x27;t be patented. But many judges also seem to believe that some software is worthy of patent protection. The problem is that &quot;software&quot; and &quot;mathematical algorithm&quot; are two terms for the same thing.</i><p>This is false on multiple levels:<p>1) Laws of physics and laws of nature and cannot be patented. Elements of the periodic table are naturally occurring materials and cannot be patented. Yet machines applying these very same laws of physics and made out of these very same materials <i>can</i> be patented. As can compounds that are new arrangements of atoms of various elements.<p>This is because machines and compounds are specific applications of patent-ineligible physical laws using configurations of patent-ineligible individual materials. Similarly, software is an application of patent-ineligible mathematical algorithms (along with a healthy dose of I/O that translates wholly non-mathematical things into mathematical representations). Just as machines are patent-eligible, software is too.<p>Laws of Physics : Machines :: Elements : Compounds :: Algorithms : Software<p>2) As evidence of the above, note that most claims for software don&#x27;t even claim specific algorithms, but rather just high-level descriptions that could be implemented in a thousand ways using a thousand different algorithms. A claim will almost never say, as one of its steps, &quot;looking up a value using a key in a hashtable&quot; -- it will almost always say something like &quot;determining a value corresponding to a key&quot;, which covers all O(1), O(logN) or O(N) algorithms. (If they even get to that level of detail at all... most claims are at an even higher level, e.g. &quot;receiving a compressed image and detecting faces in it&quot;, where each element would involve a multitude of disparate algorithms) Such language could cover any number of ways of doing something.<p>Some take this as a sign of abstractness. But when you look at patents on physical machines, their claims also rarely ever mention the precise measurements of the various components and the actual materials used. The number of materials and relative sizes that could be used in making a mechanical invention is as numerous as the number of languages, data representations and storage technologies that could be used in making a software invention. As such, machine patents also cover <i>all</i> ways in which to implement it. This is not abstractness, but rather the eliding of details that are irrelevant to the essence of the invention.<p>3) When the court says algorithms are un-patentable, they mean abstract formulae like E = MC^2. By itself, that formula does nothing, and hence is not useful. On the other hand, software for a web browser can cause your computer to fetch data from another machine a thousand miles away and display it on your screen. Regardless of level of technical competence, everyone can agree that this is non-abstract and <i>useful</i>. That&#x27;s the primary reason that software is worthy of patent protection: it meets the statutory requirements, i.e. &quot;any thing under the sun that is made by man&quot;.",1403316994

Unless you extend math to encompass reasoning about hardware, operating systems, browsers, other apps, networks etc. Math deals with more basic things.<p>The real reason software patents are harmful is because the industry moves so quickly, fueled by openness, that the patent examiners don&#x27;t always know the current state of the art, let alone obviousness. This basically kicks the can down the road and creates waste.",1403316250

It&#x27;s where the funding that is changing that makes it appear to increase. 40 years ago state funds paid for most state college costs (hence the name, &quot;state&quot; college&quot;). Now, most states are broke and rapidly withdrawing most of the funding support from their universities, shifting costs to the students.<p>Administrative staff costs are rising as well, but the tenure track professors are expected to do less and less administrative work, theoretically allowing them to teach more classes. I don&#x27;t know how much this works though.",1403316237
