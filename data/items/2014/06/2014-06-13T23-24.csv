Considering we&#x27;re talking about an entity that&#x27;s managed to become a 51%er, that assumption sounds downright Pollyannaish to me.  The same line of reasoning also supposedly implies  that nobody should want to get even close to this point. Counterfactually, as it turns out.<p>That said, I can see the attraction of that line of reasoning, too.

Without knowing C++ or OOP, would you jump to the middle of an &quot;OOP with C++&quot; blog and expect to understand the terminology? Ok, answer quickly: what&#x27;s a method?

7891445,comment,7891017,7891017,163,0,EvanMiller,,,"Dig deeper, Sam.<p>Achievement-oriented people are given to depression both when they fail and when they succeed. If your identity is tied up in your work, then you feel bad about yourself when work isn&#x27;t going well. That&#x27;s obvious, and that&#x27;s the message of this blog post. The implicit message is that you&#x27;re depressed because you&#x27;re not succeeding, so get your shit together and succeed and be happy like everyone else.<p>But then if you do succeed, you start to wonder, why did I just spend my youth in this masochistic, narcissistic path, and why the fuck am I not as happy as I was expecting, and is this really all there is in life. This is a classic &quot;achiever in crisis.&quot; The problem is that you realize all along you&#x27;ve been doing things that OTHER people wanted -- that is, you&#x27;ve been doing things that make you valuable in society -- perfect summed up in the raison d&#x27;etre du jour, &quot;making the world a better place.&quot;  And nobody stopped you, because who can argue with making the world a better place? (Or being a doctor, or whatever.) But upon reflection, you quickly realize that this was in many ways easier than asking yourself what YOU wanted out of life. I.e. you&#x27;ve pushed aside your innate feelings and desires, whatever they may have been, and replaced them with the external motivation of achievement, under the rationale that you&#x27;d be able to &quot;figure it out&quot; after you had &quot;made it&quot;.<p>Unfortunately achievers aren&#x27;t really sure what they want &quot;deep down&quot; because achievement is inherently defined by society, and then after they&#x27;ve &quot;made it&quot; they freak out because they start to wonder if there even is a &quot;deep down&quot; or if they&#x27;re just a highly educated donkey chasing a carrot.<p>If you talk to e.g. people who&#x27;ve gone through rigorous Ph.D. programs, you&#x27;ll find a number of them were severely depressed after their defense. It was just kind of a let-down after such a long buildup, and then they started to wonder why they invested the entirety of their twenties into it and question whether that&#x27;s really what they wanted their life to be. At least before the defense they could have something look forward to, and the various requirements provided a source of manic energy to propel the achiever forward.<p>Anyway I don&#x27;t think the problem here is &quot;not enough success,&quot; and I don&#x27;t think the solution is having more coffee meetings. Founders need to take a hard look in the mirror and ask themselves why they&#x27;re doing what they&#x27;re doing and whether their depression is truly a function of their free cash flow or if there&#x27;s a deeper dissonance between the founder&#x27;s feelings and the expectations of society, i.e. the heroic mythology of the founder that Silicon Valley has been inculcating in susceptible teenagers for the last 20 years.<p>Just my 2c. I am not a founder just an observer and aspiring societal psychiatrist.

A system that&#x27;s closer to Haskell&#x27;s pipes is probably what you&#x27;d want.<p>I think ISubject<I,O> has the interface for a pipe, with IObservable being a Producer equivalent, and IObserver being a Consumer equivalent.  So there may be some cunning that could be done with your own implementations [to create an Effect].

Definitely (well probably) not what you want.<p>The other way is to use the various buffering functions in Rx on the subscription, or roll your own function that has some intelligence.

7891388,comment,7890104,7890723,3,0,msandford,,,"&quot;From the ISPs perspective, Netflix&#x27;s needs are diverging from a typical free peering arrangement.&quot;<p>I would argue that point.  I pay for Internet access, not &quot;All of the Internet MINUS Netflix&quot; access.  As a result my ISP SHOULD (doesn&#x27;t mean they will) ensure that all it&#x27;s peering connections are of sufficient capacity to provide me with whatever bandwidth I choose to use up until I run into the rate limits for the plan I&#x27;m on.<p>My ISP sells me 25/5 I think so the idea that I can&#x27;t get 3Mbps worth of Netflix is suspect.<p>Of course you have to consider that when you&#x27;re not saturating your last-mile connection it could be a bottleneck anywhere.  If it&#x27;s 15 hops from me to a server if any of those 15 hops is saturated, that&#x27;s the limiting factor no matter how much capacity there is before or after.  That&#x27;s why closing a single lane on a freeway for as little as 10 feet can really screw up traffic.  You have to merge down and deal with reduced capacity even though it&#x27;s not miles and miles of lane closure.<p>What we&#x27;ve been told via one of Netflix&#x27;s backbone providers (Level 3) is that Netflix isn&#x27;t the slowdown, the backbone provider isn&#x27;t the slowdown, but the ISPs are the slowdown.  How can they say this with certainty?  Because they&#x27;re peered with various ISPs, the connections are saturated, and the ISPs refuse to upgrade their side of the peering connection unless they&#x27;re paid.<p><a href=""http://blog.level3.com/global-connectivity/observations-internet-middleman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.level3.com/global-connectivity/observations-inte...</a><p>That might sound reasonable at first brush, the ISP will incur costs associated with upgrading the peering connection.  BUT so will Level 3 incur costs.  So on that front they should cancel out, Level 3 pays for their side, ISP pays for their side, upgrade gets done and peering connection gets un-saturated.<p>Now wait, you might say, the backbone provider is pushing all this traffic on the ISP and it&#x27;s not the ISP&#x27;s fault that this deluge of data is headed it&#x27;s way, but rather the backbone provider&#x27;s fault.  And there&#x27;s some meat on those bones under one condition: the ISP doesn&#x27;t have customers who are paying it for internet access.  So that argument is not valid.  The ISP&#x27;s customers are the ones requesting the data that the ISP has promised to deliver and then the ISP wants to get paid twice.  First by the customer for internet access, and again by the backbone provider for access to customers.<p>If it&#x27;s so painful to provide the product to your customers that you have promised to them, perhaps you need to sell the business and get into another one.  That is what literally every other company in the world does:<p>1.  Offer to sell a thing to a customer<p>2.  Customer agrees to buy a thing<p>3.  Provide the thing to the customer<p>4.  Customer pays for a thing<p>5.  Profit!<p>These ISPs are so incompetent that they can&#x27;t manage step 3 without getting paid extra, again, not just by a customer but also by their supplier.

I used to commute by bike a lot and wouldn&#x27;t flinch spending $900 - $1200 on a commuting bike, but my bike also completely replaced my car, so money saved on gas, repair bills, parking, etc was well worth it.<p>I imagine this is the kind of thing that would only be worthwhile to most people if you&#x27;re really going to integrate into your lifestyle as a primary mode of transit.<p>There are obviously a lot of ways this is different from a bike but a few that seem important to me (mostly compared to a bike, and this is all pretty subjective and just my opinion on how it looks):<p>Pros\n- If you don&#x27;t push at all, less (almost no?) effort to get where you&#x27;re going.  Possibly less sweaty.\n- More portable/compact (than most bikes); not having to stop to lock up a bike seems pretty nice, especially if you have a bag you just clip/slide the board into.<p>Cons\n- Battery life; bikes don&#x27;t have batteries, and while you&#x27;re putting more energy into a bike, they make super efficient use of that energy if you have a geared bike\n- Last I checked, the board couldn&#x27;t be used in the rain; not sure if that&#x27;s still true.  Seems like it&#x27;d be more difficult to make this your lifestyle if you live somewhere it rains often (this is a big one for me)\n- Terrain; this less than the others, but there are a lot of obstacles I can deal with smoothly on a bike with large diameter wheels that seems like they might be annoying on a board<p>as always, ymmv",1402701741

This is an interesting article about the biggest new pop music station in the UK, and how they go about dealing with playlisting (effectively choosing who gets to &#x27;make it&#x27;)[0].<p>Especially at large UK festivals like Glastonbury with a broad appeal, it&#x27;s the acts that are playlisted on BBC that will be playing the festivals. It&#x27;s not just that that&#x27;s where the audience is, but it&#x27;s the echo chamber effect caused by the fact that that&#x27;s where the industry&#x27;s ears are, from the pluggers, to the PR men to the festival organisers.<p>The funny thing is that in my experience this pattern even holds true for niche scenes like math/post rock or metal, just with a different centralized power broker (be it a label, radio station, magazine or booker).<p>Like tech startups that are beholden to the VCs because they&#x27;re capital starved at an early stage, the speculative nature of music (I think) is why power tends to accumulate in the places where influence and capital lie.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/25/radio-1-playlist-secrets-uncovered-battle-of-brands"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/may/25/radio-1-playlis...</a>",1402701608

No, it&#x27;s hard because you&#x27;re doing something difficult; the difficulty level has nothing to do with getting rich.  Many people work on startups for reasons other than cashing in.<p>Antiquated -- suffering depression, in no way, makes you &quot;psychologically weak&quot;.<p>Misogynistic -- life tip: if you find yourself using the phrase, &quot;man up&quot;, you should reconsider your entire personality.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m currently in one of the downswings of the startup roller coaster ride, and am suffering from depression.  You know nothing about me, or my situation, but offer your anti-sympathetic comment regardless.<p>Seriously, please rethink your opinions.  Or, at the very least, stop sharing your thoughts.<p>To anyone else suffering from mental health issues, especially while running a startup, I strongly suggest internalizing this line: &quot;Failing sucks—there is no way to sugarcoat that.  But startups are not life-and-death matters—it’s just work.&quot;<p>Then find a person (therapist, significant other, family, friends) who can offer you support.  Someone who is as sympathetic as hippich is ignorant.",1402700599

7891294,comment,7890449,7890603,5,0,ufo,,,"The main advantage is that anything that you can turn into a a type error will be reported at compilation time, much earlier in the development cycle. This is not just a matter of safety but also helps in terms of refactoring and testing.<p>This includes things like typos (wrong method names, etc) but where types really shine is refactoring. If you want to add or remove a parameter from a function or change a string field to an integer then you can use guidance from the type checker to be sure that you didn&#x27;t forget to update anything. Its a bit like adding bumpers to the side of the bowling lane - it lets you be more reckless, updating things until the compiler shuts up without needing to carefully go through each line.<p>---<p>Also, don&#x27;t forget that gradual typing solutions such as Typed Lua are all about letting you program dynamically if you want. The idea is that you would only convert to the typed dialect in the parts of your program where that would suit you.",1402700564
