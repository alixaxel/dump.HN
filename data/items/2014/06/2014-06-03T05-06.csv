Probably similar amount on Google too.<p>At that level of spend, the executive level access and ad partner relationships on any advertising platform is a completely different world than yours.<p>I bet the head of marketing at Zoosk has Sheryl Sandberg&#x27;s number in their phone and could get her on the line pretty much 24/7 if they REALLY needed too.<p>You&#x27;re advocating with a dog whistle, while they have bull horns.<p>But the big ad platform partners have bull horns too.<p>And while obviously no one there is calling Sheryl on your behalf, even their regular day to day contacts at facebook are going to be way more influential than yours.<p>So it may be possible to piggyback off of them to get higher up the ladder.<p>If they can do that, just run through them until your big enough to have your own bull horn.<p>If they can&#x27;t do anything for you because you&#x27;re too small, you could try reaching out to other niche or regional dating advertisers that got the axe too(pry a ton that are pure desktop still too so even better).<p>Find ones with only a comfortable level of overlap to you guys and join up to bring all your individual accounts to the first platform that gets you unblocked.<p>Anyways, sucks and I feel ya, but hopefully some of that is useful.<p>PS - The 10% even allocation model you outlined is obviously ideal because it lets the market sort it out. But you also have to think about what that market mechanism would do to your business – a slower death. Big players can spend more and afford higher CPIs.

Creating the account and selecting the allowed apps was very easy, the problems came later.<p>First, all my system settings wasn&#x27;t cloned, to the new account i had to re-add things you take for granted like my localized keyboards and stuff like that, can&#x27;t remember if wifi passwords were included or not. Then comes application settings, many apps are unusable before you configure them properly, even the web browser is unusable in the default state on high dpi devices, you must change the default zoom level. Then it seems some apps actually share state, and in some cases rightfully so, finding out how they share it is a mystery. Some are designed with multi user in mind so you can in fact have a mail app accessible on both accounts without sharing your mails as the system accounts are linked to different mail accounts. Others are the other way around, maybe you want your 10GB music collection to be accessible from every account? Drawing the line of where and what should be shared is very difficult.",1401774628

I&#x27;m not even talking about university here).<p>- Last but not least, actually learn programming (I met many westerners without any of the previous problems that fail utterly).<p>Once you pass all these, you still have to find a job, and that&#x27;s not easy.

7838236,comment,7835099,7835516,6,0,mwfunk,,,"I understand why ObjC&#x27;s syntax makes some people bristle, but I&#x27;ve never felt that way myself. It&#x27;s sort of like the people that really hate Python for no other reason than the meaningful whitespace. It&#x27;s unconventional, but once you understand the rationale for it it makes sense in a way that is at least forgivable if not likable.<p>There have been a lot of C-based object-oriented APIs over the years. GObject has a C API. On the Mac, there&#x27;s Core Foundation and a bunch of other OS X APIs that are built on top of it. For over a decade on X11, before gtk and Qt even existed, the closest thing there was to a standard graphical environment was Motif (the corresponding desktop environment was CDE), and Motif was built on top of Xt. Xt was yet another C-based object system, although it was specialized for designing UI components.<p>This is all well and good but you end up with a ton of boilerplate code that does nothing but manage the lifecycles of the object instances (retain/release for example), and lends itself to extremely verbose function calls in place of object methods.<p>One possible solution is to put together some really elaborate preprocessor macros to make it look like you have extended the C language to include special syntax for your object system, so you can at least replace this:<p>obj foo = obj_factory();\nint c = obj_getNumberOfElements(foo);<p>...with something more compact like this:<p>obj foo = [Obj new];\nint c = [foo numberOfElements];<p>(the second example is ObjC-ish but the former is nothing in particular other than just what the typical C object APIs tend to look like)<p>The only catch is that the little mini-language you are extending C with using macros can&#x27;t use existing C syntax, because you can only add to the language, not alter the behavior of existing operators. So, you can&#x27;t just do method calls using a dot syntax on the instance (such as foo.numberOfElements()). So, you have to come up with something new. Maybe you always liked Smalltalk, and maybe you even based much of behavior of your object system on how Smalltalk objects behave and interact? If so, you might settle on the bracket notation. This has the added benefit of making it very clear when a chunk of code is run-of-the-mill C versus when the code is triggering the syntactic sugar you created with macros to add support for your object system to the C language.<p>C++ doesn&#x27;t exist yet, or else you might&#x27;ve just gone with that instead of rolling your own thing. Eventually C++ does exist, and you start to feel a little primitive for sticking with the weird macro language. You eventually build your mini-language into a C compiler so you don&#x27;t have use the macros anymore. You experiment with some new alternatives to the syntax that are more conventional, but no one uses them. Many developers like that the non-C-ish syntax makes it easy to distinguish between straight C code vs. interactions with the object system, which has its own set of rules and conventions.<p>Anyway, that&#x27;s mostly speculation, but something like that story is how I&#x27;ve always thought Objective-C evolved over the years. I don&#x27;t mind it nearly as much as long as I don&#x27;t think of it as a separate programming language from C (like C++ or Java or pretty much anything else these days), but rather think of it as C with some useful syntactic sugar that gets rid of a ton of boilerplate code for a particular C-based object-oriented API.",1401771882

While this is true for both longitude and latitude on Mercator, only longitudes are allowed to be straight on pseudocylindrical projections (like the one shown in the OP). Since the map in the OP only draws along horizontal lines it&#x27;s fine to use that type of projection.<p>Cylindrical (Mercator): <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mercator_projection_SW.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mercator_projection_SW.jp...</a><p>Pseudocylindrical (Wagner): <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wagner_VI_projection_SW.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wagner_VI_projection_SW.j...</a>",1401771740

I&#x27;m not sure what you are looking for in an appliance solution -- it&#x27;s a Python package, but does not require a lot code to get good results, so hopefully this may qualify. With 5 lines of Python code to import your dataset and train an out-of-box model, you can get up and running with a basic recommender. Some data munging may be required to get things into the format our model expects, but I&#x27;d love to hear what format your data is in if some munging is necessary so we can make our API as easy to use as possible.<p>You can follow the tutorial [1] to create a basic recommender (if you want to try out GraphLab Create on your machine, just pip install graphlab-create and come to our website to get a product key [2]).<p>[1] <a href=""http://graphlab.com/learn/notebooks/basic_recommender_functionalities.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphlab.com/learn/notebooks/basic_recommender_functi...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://graphlab.com/products/create/quick-start-guide.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphlab.com/products/create/quick-start-guide.html</a>",1401771737
