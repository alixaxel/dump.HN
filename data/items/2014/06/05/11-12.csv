So we&#x27;ll see a re-focusing on other software when people feel that either the OpenSSL well of exploits has at least temporarily dried up or when something else that is crucial breaks.<p>But as long as vulnerabilities in OpenSSL are discovered at this rate it seems to be an effort well-spent, and we will all reap the benefit of that effort.<p>Heartbleed <i>really</i> shook the IT world, I don&#x27;t know anybody in operations that was not affected by it. (And I can hear them collectively sighing right now). If there was a Richter scale for exploits it would have rated a &#x27;9&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like the news cycle, these things tend to burn out. But right now OpenSSL exploits are very much in the spotlight, and guarantee almost instant fame for the person discovering one. So I think we&#x27;ll see a few more of these before it will quiet down.

In fact Cameron said nothing at all, but &quot;the smile left his eyes&quot;, there was a quick handshake and he &quot;hurried off to find a less ridiculous set of people with whom to meet&quot;.&quot;<p>Sigh. Let me unpack this for you. The light left his eyes and he hurried off not because he was freaked out by your argument, per se, but because he realized that <i>you</i> didn&#x27;t realize that you were an election prop, and that you were supposed to smile, say what helped him get elected by giving him the veneer of Scientific Authority (TM), then bask in the afterglow and get some money thrown your way for some research or something, and probably get to write some public report that he would promise to read and make some noise about. You&#x27;d have been given a gravy train ticket for the duration of this deal. Also you&#x27;d be expected to explain to the press why his pet theory or proposal was fully rational and explained by your economics, and why by implication everyone who is against it are dumb and maybe a little evil people standing in the way of Science and Progress for the UK. Regardless of whether any of that was true.<p>Instead, you showed that you were naive enough to believe that he had any actual interest in his options being constrained by science or rationality, that you were actually <i>taken in</i> by his transparent rhetoric, and lo, you were discarded as soon as was convenient. He probably also significantly lowered his intelligence estimate of you.<p><i>This is not cynicism</i>. This is politics. It&#x27;s just how it works, and anyone who would care to challenge me with this theory being cynical and incorrect (and don&#x27;t forget the &quot;incorrect&quot; part), I invite you to come up with an alternate theory as to why they were shuffled off stage so quickly, if Cameron&#x27;s initial enthusiasm for science was genuine.<p>And, no sarcasm, plaudits for refusing to follow along and be corrupted. I hope this article is itself a bit of a fashionable pose about how as an incorruptible scientist the thought of taking a dirty ticket to the gravy train simply never crossed your mind, though, because the alternative would be... unflattering.",1401969159

Wouldn&#x27;t you get that very same problem with D3D?<p>>  reasonably-performant way<p>I don&#x27;t understand. How can you objectively define such thing? Doesn&#x27;t it depend on the workload? If you&#x27;re pushing 3 tris per frame, any feature can be labeled as reasonably performing, but if you have 300M, can any card these days maintain reasonable framerate even on the most basic settings? I am exagerating on purpose; some apps will require a very small amount of work on each stage of rendering, and could reasonably afford any extra pass, even if software implemented. And in other cases (which might be the majority), it doesn&#x27;t cut work. I don&#x27;t see how there could be an objective way of deciding if a feature is sufficiently performant. Your example is telling: an application as complex as F.E.A.R. Should clearly make its benchmarks (or keep a database) to decide which feature can be included without hurting performances. And even then, players have also different perceptions of what constitutes playability.<p>I agree with you: multiple standards, multiple vendors, multiple products, the fallout is &quot;struggling compatibilities&quot; at worst, &quot;varying performances&quot; at best. But that&#x27;s a common point between D3D and OpenGL, not a divergence. Am I missing something?",1401968884

There has always been a host of undiscovered talent out there that never make it &quot;big&quot;, ie: can sustain themselves and their families by doing music full time. (See Rodriguez and Searching for Sugar Man on how this goes), this goes back way before the Internet.<p>> Even if people were willing to pay for good music, many would prefer to just browse the free alternatives because there are tons of good musicians willing to race to the bottom.<p>This is exactly the problem. <i>Were</i> willing to pay for good music? This is the exact thing the parent is complaining about. Younger folk think it is for some reason not normal to pay someone else for their hard earned talent and work they put in to entertain you.

Some would say The Monkees were the poor man&#x27;s Beatles, etc.<p>The parent is complaining that it is or should be somehow acceptable or normal that you get to listen to his product for free, even if it is against his wishes. Just because you can easily copy his entire music catalog in 3 minutes over the Internet doesn&#x27;t change the fact that he should be able to charge you to listen to an album that took months to create.<p>>  How can I, as a consumer, get to listen to your music if not for free on YouTube?<p>Contact the artist?
