7866382,comment,7865917,7866165,15,0,vacri,,,"On the topic of The Way Things Are Done, I remember talking to a surgeon a little over a decade ago, talking about Weary Dunlop, an Australian folk hero. A surgeon credited with keeping a great many men alive during internment in a Japanese PoW camp in WWII, he rightfully gets a lot of accolades.<p>The surgeon I was talking to said that it was probably a good thing when Dunlop died when he did, as there were increasing murmurs in the surgical field about the extremely poor quality of his work, some floating the possibility of him being deregistered. The words my friend used were &quot;his techniques were fine for the jungle, but his skills haven&#x27;t advanced since then&quot; (&#x27;this is the way things are done&#x27;). The two examples he gave were that when doing an amputation, he wouldn&#x27;t leave a flap of skin to cover the stump; and that his sutures were &quot;almost thick enough to be twine&quot;, leading to huge, ropey scars where other surgeons were routinely making their work invisible. &quot;Old soldiers love those scars, because they can point to them and say &#x27;Dunlop worked on me&#x27;, but it&#x27;s simply bad practise&quot;. Basically my surgical friend was saying &#x27;can you imagine being the person who stripped a folk hero of the license to do the exact thing he&#x27;s a folk hero for doing?&#x27;",1402271909

Afterwards they chose which of the two they believed to be the human. In that scenario, being identified as  &quot;human&quot; more than 50% of the time would indeed make you &quot;more human than human&quot;; with a &quot;perfectly human&quot; program the test becomes essentially a coin-toss. In that context the 30% threshold makes a good deal of sense.<p>But in this variant, &quot;Do you believe the entity you spoke with to be a human or a program?&quot;, a 100% threshold is theoretically achievable. That means you&#x27;re entirely correct: a 51% vote of confidence is decidedly less human than human. Additionally the 30% threshold they&#x27;ve used is laughably low in this context. Without a control group, even an 100%-confidence outcome probably says more about the beliefs of the judges than the ability of the program to simulate a human.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to take away from the no-doubt impressive achievement by the team behind Eugene.

For a chalk and talk scenario, I use a notepad (that tears off at the top) and follow the blackboard and add commentary. If I can&#x27;t process the information, I devolve to rote copying. This is the raw material of studying that I will attempt to understand later. For slides: ideally I will have a copy of the slides and take notes overtop. If I don&#x27;t have the slides before but I will have them after, then I will try to understand the information and take extra notes. If I will never have the slides I&#x27;m unlikely to really benefit from the lecture, I might actually buy the textbook.<p>Tutorial: If the TA is good I&#x27;ll sit still and pay attention to the problem solving. Otherwise I won&#x27;t attend. No notes.<p>Reading: Highlighting and margin notes on the first pass, and then very very terse notes on paper on the second pass. I might end up with 10 pages of notes for a one semester course.<p>Other non-student situations:<p>For keeping track of actions taken from the command line I use a text file, emacs org-mode, and keep track of every command run, issues that I ran into, and commands used to verify. After a few run-throughs this may get boiled down to a shell script or some other type of program. I initially developed this habit working on EC2 before EBS existed, but now I deliberately destoy VMs and start from scratch often so I can be sure that I have a working process for getting up and running.<p>For some type of programmatic data processing, I will usually use a python file. As I&#x27;m working I won&#x27;t revise anything, I&#x27;ll just keep adding on the bottom. I will then run it like &quot;% python -i scratch.py&quot; so I can examine failure at the prompt and continue to add the the file and re-run as I figure things out.<p>For memory augmentation while thinking, for example for design work, I personally generally use letter (A4) size paper along with a pen, so I can spread out the paper on my desk while I get to grips with the problem. Typical to fill 3-10 pages. At this point I&#x27;m mainly using the computer just to retrieve reference material and the verify things. Ideally these notes get scanned later but I probably won&#x27;t use them again. Stage 2 is to take the notes and try to distil it into a 1-page coherent top-down design. Sometimes I will cheat by using 11x17 notepad and a mechanical pencil, which allows an extravagant amount of detail an a single sheet.<p>I currently have a fresh A3 170-page moleskine that I&#x27;m saving for some kind of massive project that needs this much space.

7866252,comment,7865852,7865955,2,0,tomp,,,"Well, the problem with C++/Java and the ML language families is that they are quite incompatible, so it&#x27;s not really trivial to mix them. Many languages have tried, most recent languages really. Rust is C with ADTs or ML without garbage collection (not yet sure how closures will turn out), Scala is Java with first-class functions and ADTs, Java and C# are absorbing more and more features from ML, ...<p>Swift is just another attempt to mix the two, quite a successful one IMO. They kept some warts, probably to maintain binary compatibility with Obj-C, but otherwise I think it&#x27;s a huge improvement over Java-style languages.<p>One particular pain point between Java-style and ML-style languages are generics; Java and C# have a common object protocol and thus allow a top type, Object, and run-time type information. So, they must decide whether generics/type parameters are only relevant at compile-time (Java) or are kept at run-time (C#). ML avoids this issue by not having any runtime type information (and no type-testing construct). I haven&#x27;t yet found where Swift stands, but it&#x27;s a hard problem to solve.",1402268545

PRISM has an NSA part and a company part. The company had to build out their end in order to participate in PRISM.<p>However it&#x27;s important to realize that compliance in <i>some form</i> with NSLs and warrants was not optional for Apple. By not participating in PRISM they would simply have turned over the same data on each request by manual means.<p><i>That</i> modality is probably an even bigger threat to user privacy than PRISM. In PRISM, Apple&#x27;s legal team would have to vet each and every single NSL or warrant and then manually activate an automated process to ship the required data over. While Apple didn&#x27;t release a ton of details about how they implement it, this automated process is precisely the thing that can be done without a raft of Apple employees having to map/reduce it all manually (and possibly leak part of it themselves, maliciously or accidentally).",1402268445
