7881869,comment,7881692,7881692,10,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Is this surprising to anyone, structurally it is exactly the same as the mortgage issue in 2009 with Freddie and Fannie. The government finances the lending of money (by absorbing the risk) and gives banks money at a few percent which they loan out at 5 - 6% or more. You combine that with for profit universities which have discovered that the bank and their interests are aligned, they charge what ever they want for tuition, the banks make sure the students can get that in the form of guaranteed loans and non-dismissable loans, and the students play their part by putting themselves into indentured servitude. There is no other way for this to play out.<p>I&#x27;ve written my congress critters and suggested they notify the banks that they are going to make loans dischargable in bankruptcy in 4 years, they are going to change the guarantee to be 60 cents to the dollar.
