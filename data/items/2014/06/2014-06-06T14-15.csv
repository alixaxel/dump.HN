You don&#x27;t get solid type-checking like you do with generics in other languages (except C++), but that has never really been an issue because the above statement works even with [...] statements (sure, the compiler will warn you, but).<p>The only real issue is that the things you shove into Objective-C containers must themselves be Objective-C types, which means using NSNumber and NSValue everywhere for raw C types.

7858199,comment,7856164,7856164,1,0,mkag,,,"It seems that the main issue is that people are only now discovering that PhDs and perhaps sometimes undergrad degrees in humanities are not vocational. This isn&#x27;t to say they aren&#x27;t worthwhile or that students shouldn&#x27;t pursue them. There are plenty of degrees or experiences that are unlikely to be marketable in the future economy. The main thing students must learn is how to learn, and one can accomplish this by studying a variety of fields.<p>It does, however, mean that subsidizing higher education is a risky proposition. Universities go to great lengths to create humanities requirements perhaps in part motivated by a genuine belief that core requirements are necessary for a proper education, but likely also to beef up departments that have been isolated from market pressures. These departments are often political (almost always liberal), ideological, and rarely subject to any kind of quality control (there was the famous case of Larry Summers questioning what exactly Cornell West was doing as a tenured Harvard professor). Subsidizing learning with no direct market rewards can be a very smart long term investment in human capital. We need history and literature to have the cognitive tools to innovate and to articulate ideas necessary for the Western world to exist. But on the other hand, it&#x27;s a dangerous proposition to create a mini-industry where you pay people without a clear understanding of what they are doing and why.",1402066411

For some perspective, 34,000 people died in the US during 2012 due to motor vehicles[1].<p>The big automakers are ultimately causing way more deaths by not adopting autonomous vehicle technology sooner if you ask me.  And they will continue to do so because they realize that autonomous fleets make more sense than every consumer buying a car or two hence autonomous cars mean their business is in jeopardy/going to shrink.<p>We might also look into deaths associated with air quality/pollution and the number of deaths resulting from it.  Its always going to be hard to pin down what number of deaths correlates to how many cars driving some number of miles, but I would put serious money on lower emission vehicles significantly reducing deaths resulting from air pollution. Detroit&#x27;s reluctance to adopt cleaner technology and its obvious love affair with oil is killing many more than their incompetent switch DREs.<p>Ultimately, even the switch design is a similar phenomena.  While many automakers started to get away from keyed ignition switches altogether, GM has continued to use a super cheap part that&#x27;s obviously a design from the past.  You can&#x27;t tell me the radio on my grandmothers key ring cost versus their switch is worth 13 lives.<p>Certainly, don&#x27;t mean to trivialize those that have been killed by this, just want to point out that Detroit is so slow to change that ultimately its costing us way more lives than just those killed by this switch problem.<p>1 <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in_U.S._by_year"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_motor_vehicle_deaths_in...</a>",1402065060
