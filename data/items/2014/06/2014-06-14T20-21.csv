There are lots of things that you can do, I would suggest making all of the below equal priorities going forward:<p>- Meet your customers needs: I don&#x27;t really know what this means, make sure to hear from those that are using it right now, and those that will say that they will do it. You might end up getting feedback to add features like:\na) Templates: You support only OpenOffice templates? I believe it should not be too hard to support more formats like RTF, Text Documents, and MS Office documents.\nb) API: Supporting Node.js, Java, and other languages. You might want to look at a site like Stripe.com for examples on how to structure developer documentation.\nc) Output: Perhaps supporting HTML outputs as well as PDFs.<p>- Homepage: I think your homepage looks good, but can get much better. It might be a good idea to find similar/adjacent companies and see how they do their homepage. I think you should move the &#x27;reasons to use&#x27; further up the page.<p>- Pricing Page: Not sure if I really care about the number of servers running. Also, jobs per day - are you really expecting that many users? I think you might want to significantly reduce the amount of usage per day in each tier. I think you will also likely want to tier on different criteria - perhaps support, keeping a history of converted documents, and others that your users will ask for.<p>- Conversion: Are you tracking what percentage of visitors are converting to signup? Are you trying A/B testing different prompts to them?<p>- Driving Traffic: You could think about doing guest posts, blogging on your site, buying ads, and building integrations into other tools to drive traffic.",1402778999

Ada had no bearing on the failure. They plugged in a controller for a different vehicle entirely.<p>The question is about relative confidence between a statically typed and a runtime typed software. The fact remains that given a fixed/finite budget of testing, wise people will not even think of deploying a runtime typed system for such tasks. These tasks cannot afford runtime errors, so it is imperative that due diligence be made to prove that they cannot happen.<p>(You cannot send several manned missions to the moon just to test) I am not aware of runtime typed systems that afford such proofs before running it and if some do, it is a statically proven system to begin with.<p>Revisit my points about runtime errors on a flight controller.

Whatever it was, it was something that did not prove that such races cannot happen, in other words it was open to runtime error, which is exactly what we want to eliminate as far as possible. We will run it a few times and see what gives, is not a tenable strategy for many important tasks.<p>> It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of googling to find that Nasa used to use a Symbolics Lisp machine<p>You are being slightly disingenuous here, I was talking about deployed flight controllers that actually control the thing when its on flight.<p>As I have said its like arguing with birthers, you have made up your mind and no matter what I say you will try to avoid the logic of eliminating costly runtime errors.",1402778899

I do not claim being involved particularly deeply in either the academic or the industrial security community, but my impression from the occasional academic discussion group I have managed to find the time to drop in on always was that this and/or some related proposition was part of what is commonly held to be true beyond the need for argument.<p>Regardless, there are two separate questions here - firstly, whether some sort of foul play actually was involved with the Truecrypt project closing up shop, and secondly, whether the recommendation to switch to Bitlocker should be considered sound or not. I believe that the recommendation is dangerous regardless of what happened with Truecrypt - at the very least, making no recommendation at all or telling people to stay with Truecrypt (7.1) for the time being and giving the OSS community some time to try and fill the vacuum is not worse than making said recommendation under any circumstances. In that light, even if your scenario is more compelling, I would argue that simply to err on the side of caution, one ought to refrain from pushing a narrative to the effect of &quot;nothing fishy here; these perfectly trustworthy people just told you to use Bitlocker, make of that what you will&quot; at this point in time.",1402778020

OSI coined it. Specifically, Christine Petersen coined it.<p>It appears to be such a natural term now that we have become convinced that we were using it before OSI, but we weren&#x27;t. The earliest OED citation for &quot;open source&quot; is from 1998, around the time when OSI coined it. If you have an earlier citation, please submit it to the OED. I don&#x27;t believe one exists.<p>There is an unrelated term &quot;open source intelligence&quot; which is indeed older, but nobody called software &quot;open source&quot; before OSI.",1402776529
