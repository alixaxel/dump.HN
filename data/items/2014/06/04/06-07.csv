7844338,comment,7834665,7836803,1,0,orbifold,,,"I think your complaints are misguided. In terms of desktop usability and feature integration Mac OS X beats any Linux installation I&#x27;ve ever used. This is what most people care about, not how many file descriptors there can be at once. In terms of backup, Time Machine together with a Time Capsule is the only backup system my dad has ever consistently used so far. It does not matter if there are superior solutions for more advanced users, as long as there is no dead simple solution. To my knowledge there is no linux distribution that offers something as simple out of the box.<p>OS X sort of lacks in default command line tools, but that can be fixed rather easily. I also feel that as Windows 8 compared to OS X loses easily both for Design and Usability, Windows 7 came closer. There are obvious limitations to the approach of all desktop operating systems and for that matter the whole &quot;desktop&quot; and &quot;application&quot; metaphor, compared to systems like the Lisp Machine. Ideally a power user would have access to a fully programmable system, without prepackaged applications and type directed interactions.",1401865082

People were going apeshit over these funny electronic sounds,&quot; Moog recalled.<p>> &quot;I heard Walter Carlos doing /Switched-On Bach/,&quot; rock keyboardist Keith Emerson said, &quot;and on the cover of the album was this thing that looked like a telephone exchange.&quot;[11] Fascinated, Emerson made enquiries, and managed to borrow a Moog synthesizer for a live rendition of the theme music from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey.<p>> The extraordinary noises the synthesizer made baffled the audience to such an extent that Emerson decided he had to have a Moog synthesizer of his own to play on stage. So the rock star called the inventor and told him what he wanted to do. Moog replied that he would not recommend it—his synthesizers were only meant to be audio equipment.<p>Nonetheless, Emerson insisted, eventually shelling out £30,000—a princely sum—for a massive, modular system. He was very proud of his new acquisition. &quot;Trouble was it arrived with no instruction book—three oscillators, a reverb unit, trigger controls, filters, mixers, and a load of strange wires and plugs, and I couldn&#x27;t even switch the damn thing on. You needed to be a rocket scientist.&quot;<p>> Such problems were typical of products made by early U.S. synthesiszer firms, all of which suffered from bad management and chronic underfinancing. &quot;We were always in the red,&quot; Moog lamented, &quot;we had no capital. None. Zero.&quot; They would stumble along from one National Association of Music Manufacturers show (where instrument dealers gather to place orders) to the next. If you didn&#x27;t have a hit at one year&#x27;s show, then you had better have one at the next, or you were dead.&quot;<p>> A second problem was quality. According to Moog, &quot;In the late sixties and early seventies, you could put five pounds of shit in a box, and if it made a sound you could sell it.&quot; In addition to poor manufacturing, another recurrent vexation was the inherently unstable nature of these early, analog synthesizers.<p>> The oscillators that generated the sound were controlled by electrical voltages. To boost an oscillator&#x27;s pitch up an octave took a corresponding increase in voltage. The trouble was that the damn things wouldn&#x27;t stay in tune—their pitch was notorious for drifting. A ripple in the power supply, a change in temperature as the hall heated up or as the components themselves became warmer, almost anything was enough to set them adrift, necessitating a retune.<p>> &quot;The tuning was a nightmare,&quot; Emerson recalled, &quot;I had a frequency counter built into my system which I had to keep an eye on, plus I was playing the Hammond and two other instruments. When I look back now, I don&#x27;t know how I got through it, I really don&#x27;t.&quot;<p>> An expanding market, undercapitalized firms, poor manufacturing, and unreliable components—this was a scenario that was virtually tailor-made for the Japanese, with their deep pockets, superb production skills, and long-term commitment. Japanese firms began to make their presence felt in the synthesiser market from the mid-seventies on.",1401864035

Clearly if person A pays person B to perform a task, then person B must be creating at least as much value as they&#x27;re being paid. Who are you or I to judge that value? We&#x27;re neither receiving the value nor paying for it. If person A is consistently paying more than $2 for $1 of value, then they&#x27;ll soon be out of money, and the system will unceremoniously remove person A from decision making authority.<p>While it&#x27;s nice to suggest that Wall St. doesn&#x27;t create any value for people, ~20% of our GDP would suggest otherwise. The truth is that Wall St. acts much like Adam Smith&#x27;s invisible hand. For our system to work, capital must be allocated to optimal uses. Command economies do a poor job of this, except in war time. Wall St. helps us reallocate capital to the most productive endeavors. That sounds pretty valuable to me. Even if the folks on Wall St. don&#x27;t build your car, they did pool the capital necessary to finance the construction of the manufacturing facility. Can&#x27;t have one without the other.<p>As a final point, if the &#x27;caring class&#x27; isn&#x27;t compensated enough, perhaps it&#x27;s because there is an oversupply of &#x27;caring folks&#x27;. Or perhaps they&#x27;re not really creating any value for others? Perhaps some of the &#x27;caring class&#x27; should get creative and find other ways to be caring, or perhaps they should find ways to provide more &#x27;care&#x27; with their time so they can command a higher share of the value they create?",1401863127
