I was a very passionate kde user (and have also contributed a lot to the code base). I have given up on KDE since the last 4 years or so. The oxygen theme is such an eye sore.

Kwin really rocks but I&#x27;m hesitant to become friends with the plasma concept in KDE. Ranting from my gut on news.yc is not really productive but I really think it&#x27;s just bad design. It gets in my way and on my nerves. I don&#x27;t remember such feelings from Unity or Windows.<p>Qt5/QML2/Wayland are all great ideas but these can&#x27;t compensate for bad design. If I install a fresh KDE it feels like a Desktop to show your 16 year old friend and explain them the concepts but actually never do more than playing around with the knobs. This is of course nice and legit but it&#x27;s not a Desktop for getting work done.<p>So maybe I just want a switch to disable activities and widgets and get some more RAM and calm for that.<p>This is really difficult and I don&#x27;t want to ridicule any effort and the hard work that went into KDE. I&#x27;m not involved and don&#x27;t have a lot of better ideas to offer. So don&#x27;t take me too serious - I just have the feeling that a lot of these efforts will perish due to bad design and strange ideas about UI.",1403823470

Nearly all new permission requirements can then be made without touching the code at all, or in more than a couple of places.<p>The idea is to choose a new design that scales better.  If you have M permissions and N permission checks then each new requirement might cause M * N changes to the codebase.<p>If you have a reasonable permission system you might end up having to make N changes to the codebase (worst-case) or perhaps only M modifications to permissions or perhaps both.

Simpler becomes conceptually harder very quickly, because it means challenging a lot of assumptions and opening up some unknowns.<p>The tried-and-true implementation has a known initial cost and cost scaling factor as it&#x27;s repeated throughout an application, while an experimental (and overdesigned) one is extremely sensitive to context and could become a net negative if it fails.<p>When we talk about &quot;technical debt,&quot; I think we&#x27;re describing something that isn&#x27;t an experimental design, it&#x27;s just &quot;below&quot; the known standard - it&#x27;s faster to implement, but it cannot scale, and we already know that. Conversely, a standard practice is one that works and doesn&#x27;t usually get pushed to its tolerance limits.<p>The corollary of this is that for any engineering project taking on a big enough problem, you have to assume some technical debt to ground the system in a place where each module can be tested as part of a whole: otherwise your work will go too deep into the experimental/overdesigned zone before it ever completely functions.",1403822735

They have refused to peer-review their protocols and validation data, so their assays are essentially a black box. So far, incredibly, they have managed to get away with this thanks to a glaring regulatory loophole (as the article explains); but sooner or later they&#x27;ll have to open up if they want their assays to be taken seriously by the medical community.<p>In broader terms, however, there&#x27;s been <i>a lot</i> of recent work in the well-established microfluidics [1] literature on whole-blood assays [2], so that can give you a good guess about how they go about their implementation: most likely some form of &quot;lab-on-a-disk&quot; centrifugation for plasma separation and subsequent transport to separate microfluidic optical chambers preloaded with colorimetric reagents for readout, using perhaps a digital camera and some non-kosher/black-boxy form of curve-fitting DSP to increase &quot;sensitivity&quot;.<p>In all I&#x27;m very skeptical until they open up and provide peer-reviewed validation data for their assays.

Maybe I&#x27;m the wrong user.. but I do programming and do sysadmin stuff most of the time..<p>First the good parts: KDE is quite stable for me. I have hardly any crashes... this is huge as Unity had some ugly bugs I could not resolve.<p>But I had to install the Numix theme and icons and tweak knobs to get a common look between KDE/GTK2/GTK3.. I found the default Oxygen ugly and not well designed but this is probably a question of taste.<p>With Numix the machine feels and looks great but I&#x27;m not so happy after installing Windows 8.1 on an 10 year old Pentium M notebook with 2GB RAM and having to realize that Windows is way faster and responsive and more feature-rich than KDE and Unity and requires less RAM.<p>I&#x27;m not trolling - I&#x27;m talking about stuff like browsing files using the file manager and using a browser or office for writing documents.<p>Back to KDE: I don&#x27;t understand Plasma at all - I don&#x27;t use &quot;activities&quot; I tried it but found it useless. I don&#x27;t care about widgets. I&#x27;d care more if the widgets would not be so useless.. something like gkrellm that ran on fvwm95 gives me more and better data about cpu/disk/network usage than any widgets I&#x27;ve found in the collections.<p>Memory... at least 400MB RSS after a fresh boot running only Konsole. No semenatic desktop, no Akonadi, no widgets... This is just crazy.<p>I have no SSD and 4GB RAM - maybe I&#x27;m too cheap for KDE but Akonadi and all semantic desktop parts never worked for me.<p>Why can&#x27;t I disable the desktop search? After some hours googling I managed to kill most of Akonadi and Desktop search but I really would enjoy something like a minimal KDE desktop.<p>Dolphin/Kwin/Konsole/Kate/Okular are really great tools, through and I enjoy using them more than the Gnome tools..<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m an old grumpy user - I really enjoy the Unity concept and even found Gnome3 interesting but I&#x27;m still feel some longing from time to time for the speed and functionality of KDE 3.5.<p>But overall I can work with KDE. I would be probably a lot more happy if I had a SSD and 16GB RAM and well.. that sucks. I don&#x27;t want to install Windows on this machine for it to be faster!<p>I know there are alternatives.. but running Windows 8.1 on this 10 year old Pentium M notebook just made clear to me that the problem is not the hardware - it&#x27;s the software.<p>Why is it so hard to to have a highly functional and low-footprint system?",1403821206
7951846,comment,7948688,7950816,1,0,dalke,,,"In the context of the Ariane rocket, it seems like a language with a proper numeric tower would have been unlikely to run on the given hardware. That is, the decision to not add explicit range checks to a few of the variables (including the critical one which overflowed) was based in part on keeping the processor load down.<p>> It has been stated to the Board that not all the conversions were protected because a maximum workload target of 80% had been set for the SRI computer. To determine the vulnerability of unprotected code, an analysis was performed on every operation which could give rise to an exception, including an Operand Error. In particular, the conversion of floating point values to integers was analysed and operations involving seven variables were at risk of leading to an Operand Error. This led to protection being added to four of the variables, evidence of which appears in the Ada code.<p>I find it hard to believe that a language which checks every case for possible overflow would be faster than a language which does not (excluding possible program flow analysis that wasn&#x27;t available then). Thus, I don&#x27;t think the engineering tradeoffs for the Ariane really apply for a spreadsheet where gobs of excess cycles are available, so I find it difficult to use the errors with the former to guide the latter.<p>That said, I recognize that you&#x27;re on a different topic. I wanted only to point out that &quot;the current default are just nuts&quot; has nothing to do with exception handling in the Ariane, and I think using the Ariane as a basis for your explanation doesn&#x27;t apply.",1403821190

I think Processing, especially in its static mode, does a good job at helping make the leap to actual programming (typing in code) without exposing the novice to as many real programming language constructs like Python does.  Since it so trivial to get drawing, animation, and interaction going with Processing, I also find it is more fun for the first timer, especially the ones who don&#x27;t have a natural geek bent.  I&#x27;d say go with Python for year two, when you know you have the ones that cared enough to return for more.",1403820347

I&#x27;ve been following clojure for awhile, I&#x27;ve listened to--I think--all of Rich Hickey&#x27;s talks. I&#x27;ve also been recently reading more and more about Haskell.

I don&#x27;t mean that in a functionally pure way (though there&#x27;s that too) but ideologically and vision-wise.  They both just feel really clean and focussed compared to a lot of languages I use.<p>I think I lean toward haskell right now just because I&#x27;m doing .net full time and doing .net and anything even remotely related java ecosystem at the same time would probably make me crazy.

As a result, they were constantly playing catch-up with the system integration that Gnome had built. I particularly remember the Network-Manager applet being bad enough that I just used the Gnome one.<p>Nevertheless, keep up the good work KDE!",1403820055
