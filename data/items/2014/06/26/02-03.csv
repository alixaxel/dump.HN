You gotta be kidding me. I agree with the argument that most of the illegitimate wealth get invested in India in one way or other and most of it might not be present in Swiss banks and several other things from the article, but above comment shows the author has no idea how Indian society is operating internally. I have lived both in village and in the city, I&#x27;ve seen salaried city/village people having many opinions/feelings for &quot;farmers&quot; but resentment was not one of them.",1403751540

If I can offer one single piece of advice, it&#x27;s this: reduce scope and focus on the essentials.<p>Every single API changes from time to time. Managing the conflicts of multiple change schedules on interdependent subsystems quickly becomes an O(n!) problem. You <i>will</i> have to choose some balls to drop - because you&#x27;ll drop some, and, in some cases, you should consider dropping the least important ones immediately and working under the assumption those balls are gone forever. Some can be delayed - APIs that offer legacy modes, the toolsets that don&#x27;t need to be updated (and fully supported) immediately. Skipping versions may be fine and running your servers on CentOS 6, while not sexy, is workable.<p>This approach has kept me sane.",1403751421

There is too much sarcasm and too much talking down to in there. The reality lies somewhere in the middle.<p>For example none of the Indians I know ever said their country will become rich if all the undisclosed wealth is siezed by the government. The reality is there is way too much corruption and the majority of the ill-gotten wealth is in India. In all but the biggest cities the real estate is not priced to market per the government and so the property is registered at 1/4th the value (for e.g.) and so taxes paid on only that amount. The rest is not disclosed and reinvested into the real estate market. There is a lot of that going on.

7947856,comment,7939181,7943237,3,0,vacri,,,"Well, the chef analogy breaks down a little because much of what a chef does has a time limit measured in hours.<p>Modern-day philosophers don&#x27;t have a lot to offer modern-day physicists I guess... because most of the relevant philosophical problems have largely been solved, especially in the area of experimental design.<p>I&#x27;m not a philosopher, and I don&#x27;t bill myself as one. I was trained in science, have done a partial PhD on the visual system, and worked as a medical scientist. I have had zero formal classroom training in philosophy. I have one article published in a second-tier peer-reviewed journal. I see myself as a scientist and spent a quarter of my career working as one. I started out with the same ridiculous prejudices against philosophy as the naysayers here in this thread.<p>Then I started looking in a bit more detail about <i>how</i> and <i>why</i> we do experiments the way we do. The stuff we take for granted - things like minimising independent variables, or the null hypothesis, or peer review, or ethics in research, or the importance of being very specific in your starting definitions, or knowing <i>how to ask</i> a robust, testable question - all these kinds of things were reasoned about and a path(s) was found to the best way to do things to get robust results. And these things aren&#x27;t inherent to the physical world - they&#x27;re issues around <i>reasoning</i>. Not physics or biology or chemistry. It was eye-opening just how much ridiculous stigma and bad stereotypes are promoted by a certain kind of scientist.<p>Thing is, the two fields are not in conflict. For the most part, they are looking for truth in different areas - hence why doing physics and doing philosophy aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive. They&#x27;re not in competition, for the most part, and one field isn&#x27;t &#x27;better&#x27; than the other field. It&#x27;s a silly, childish thing to suggest that these fields are competing; that there has to be a &#x27;winner&#x27;. Does psychology &#x27;win&#x27; over chemistry? Who &#x27;wins&#x27; in the competition between music and mathematics? These fields aren&#x27;t seen as being in competition (and there&#x27;s some synergy between maths and music, just like I&#x27;m saying there is between physics and philosophy).<p>Asking &quot;so, what have philosophers given physicists lately&quot;(the occupations) is really a meaningless question, and implies that philosophy (the field) is only valid if it&#x27;s constantly giving new insights to physics (the field). One could just as easily say &quot;what have physicists given philosophers lately? Are philosophers of consciousness better able to discuss their topic because of the work of physicists?&quot;. Put that way, it&#x27;s clear how silly it is to make these fields compete. Yes, there may be some conflict on the fringes (&#x27;what is the nature of existence&#x27; type stuff), but for the most part, they&#x27;re harmonious entities, not enemies.<p>In short, the two fields are not dichotomous. You are in fact a significantly better scientist if you understand the reasons underlying <i>why</i> you conduct experiments the way you do. It allows you to modify your experimental procedures in a robust way. It&#x27;s amusing to see people so stigmatising philosophy that they demand that their own philosophical utterances are due to a different field - as if it somehow hurts to say &quot;this part of what I do is philosophy, that part is physics, and the other part is chef work&quot;. Elsewhere in this thread you&#x27;ll see a lovely example, where someone uses Occam&#x27;s Razor against philosophy... :)",1403749702

Also spent the first 5 of those 10 years getting it wrong in terms of biz model.<p>There are two things that are hurting you.<p>1. Corporate marketing: It&#x27;s very important for every tech company to give the perception they&#x27;re ahead of the curve, that they know magic stuff that you don&#x27;t, that they&#x27;re so smart it&#x27;s not worth even trying to compete with them, that you better buy from them or work for them or you&#x27;re completely screwed. You&#x27;re believing this bullshit.<p>2. Geek obsession with shiny new things. Most of the new languages, platforms, storage engines and dev tools that come out are 5+ years away from being ready for production. Many of them are a solution looking for a problem. Many of them are proprietary or pseudo-open-source looking to create vendor lock-in or opportunities for monetization for a specific company. What most profitable companies use is old school to most developers, especially on the west coast and especially in the Valley. So just don&#x27;t use new stuff until they&#x27;re main stream. Read about them (in an article of 800 words or less), figure out what they&#x27;re about and move on until they&#x27;re ready for production - and even then decide whether you really have a need for the thing.<p>You can sit down today and spend a few months writing a kick-ass web application using Linux, Apache with Nginx, PHP and MySQL and generate thousands of dollars a day in revenue or raise millions on the back of the product/service.<p>Linux: Created 1991.\nPHP: Created 1994.\nMySQL: Created 1995.\nApache: Created 1995.\nNginx: Created 2002.<p>There are few innovations that are really game changing. A few that come to mind:<p>Nginx: Solved the C10K problem and lets you have over 100,000 concurrent connections to your web server using only a few megs of memory. Put it in front of Apache web server and divide your front-end hardware costs by 100.<p>HTML5&#x27;s web sockets: Now you CAN have push communication via HTTP. Previously long-polling was the only option.<p>One thing I do agree with: Doing customer service if you&#x27;re a developer does suck. However if you learn to love your customers and stay on top of it, it ain&#x27;t so bad. And it&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m about to spend my evening doing.",1403748070
