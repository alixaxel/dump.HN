7926044,comment,7925633,7925946,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>Am I the only person that thinks government regulation is a reasonable thing for the taxi industry? Regulations on work hours, car safety, tougher environmental standards, driver training, requiring pickup if called, etc all seem reasonable.</i><p>I agree.<p>The medallion system is a disaster. In fact, it&#x27;s systemized government corruption. Most of these medallion-owning assholes have never driven a taxi in their lives. They&#x27;re just rent-seeking vampires.<p>The purpose of limiting the supply of drivers is to prevent a race to the bottom-- and I would generally support that, for a variety of reasons. But the effect of the medallion system is that drivers do no better under the system than without it, because they have to pay enormous leasing fees.<p>A fully unregulated system is a bad idea (it means you&#x27;re screwed if you live in the outer boroughs, it will encourage unsafe conditions and driving) but the medallion system needs to be shut down.<p><i>I do think things like Uber and Airbnb are very cool and innovative</i><p>Uber is an evil company. It&#x27;s not surge pricing alone that makes it evil. It&#x27;s the complete lack of transparency around surge pricing, and the fact that (unlike Lyft) it increases its own take when surge is in effect. It&#x27;s one thing for prices to go up when the supply of cars can&#x27;t mean demand. It&#x27;s an entirely different situation when the (a) pricing algorithm is opaque and (b) it&#x27;s determined unilaterally by a company with every incentive to manipulate it.<p>I am glad to see the medallion parasites under threat, though. If I were mayor of any of these cities, my first move would be to scrap the medallion system, with no compensation to their owners.",1403384264

Arguments on all sides are driven by selfish parties that only want to set up a system to benefit them. At the end of the day Uber would like to be the only game in town and Uber investors would like nothing more than a well-oiled corporate machine that prints money. So all this talk of consumer choice and safety is a red herring. It&#x27;s definitely good marketing but don&#x27;t be fooled into thinking Uber is helping anyone but themselves when they push for deregulation.<p>So yes I&#x27;m with you on this one.

In my (Christian) view, it&#x27;s an important aspect of moral maturity to be able to be <i>nice</i> to immoral people without <i>cooperating</i> with their goals.

Staying in Fremont, CA, needing a trip to the San Jose airport at 4:50 in the morning.  I had a cab &#x27;scheduled&#x27; but a few drivers didn&#x27;t show up, and they didn&#x27;t bother calling me to let me know that they were not going to show up.  The dispatcher didn&#x27;t speak english well and didn&#x27;t understand the questions that I asked.  If I had instant feedback that nobody was coming, I would have made alternate plans the minute that I knew nobody was going to pick me up.  \n2.) In Chicago for a business trip.  I generally don&#x27;t carry cash, but, needed a ride from point a to point b.  Taxi driver&#x27;s sticker said he took credit cards, but his machine was &#x27;down.&#x27;  A &quot;standoff&quot; of sorts occurred between me, the taxi driver, and Chicago PD;  ultimately, after the police harassing him (and reminding him that a working credit card reader was required in the city), he reluctantly ran my credit card and let me out of his car.<p>It&#x27;s unfair that the Taxi companies skirt these rules too -- Uber and Lyft just give their ecosystems a quicker way to get ride of bad actors and focus on customer service, where the Taxi companies are focused on keeping the medallion owners happy.",1403381961

I think the most obstructive interpretation would still need to be something like &quot;dome&quot; - definitely not flat.<p>So, why not a flat circle? Well there are other words used for that exact thing, as in 2 Chronicles 4 / or 1 Kings 7:23 [3]:<p>><i>Now [Solomon] made the sea of cast metal [of the altar] ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in form, and its height was five cubits, and thirty cubits in circumference.</i> //<p>This is the word for the plane shape &quot;circle&quot; (<i>&#x27;agol</i>) that matches the brim of a cup (or giant bowl-shaped altar!).<p>Note that the figures leaves the brim at 5 - 30/2pi ~= a hands breadth under some interpretations, just as Kings 7:26 suggests. But that verse 7:26 also says that the brim was like that of a lily, not a hands-breadth at the brim but fine and dainty ... and here in lies a very interesting piece of gematria [use of letters for numbers] associated with the Kings passage [4] which in short form encodes in a variant word form <i>qava</i> (=111) for <i>qav</i> (=106) in the oldest Hebrew version of the passage [that in Kings] is the ratio 111/106; the implication being that the true figures should be 30/10 x 111/106 which gives an excellent approximation to pi.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H2329&t=NIV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Stro...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isa+40%3A22&version=NIV;NASB;MSG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=isa+40%3A22&vers...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://biblehub.com/niv/2_chronicles/4.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biblehub.com/niv/2_chronicles/4.htm</a> or <a href=""http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-23.htm</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.mathteacherctk.com/blog/2011/08/biblical-and-gematria/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathteacherctk.com/blog/2011/08/biblical-and-gema...</a>",1403381928
