7832229,comment,7829716,7831739,1,0,nl,,,"I downvoted you for a number of reasons, none of which are what PG are talking about.<p>Basically, I think your comment lacked perspective.<p>All cultures have taboos and rites. It is extremely difficult to predict how they will change in the future.<p>For example, the ancient Greeks had no taboo against homosexuality (indeed, it was considered normal), but they also had nothing against keeping slaves.<p>The US as a nation has no taboo against advertising to children, and yet attitudes to homosexuality vary dramatically by region. Extreme violence in films is considered taboo in most cultures, and yet entertaining in the US.<p>Racism is publicly decried in the US, and yet remains ingrained in some other countries.<p>Eating dogs is taboo in the US, not in other countries. Bacon is considered a delicacy in the US, and taboo in many countries.<p>Sometimes religion is the carrier of some of these taboos and rites, and sometimes it is not. Sometimes religion innoculates a culture against a particular practice (eg, Halal means alcoholism isn&#x27;t a big problem in Muslim countries), and other times it is used to both justify it and to fight it (eg the changing Christian attitude to Slavery).<p>I suspect you&#x27;d be better off justifying your post rather than complaining about persecution of downvotes.",1401692232

I was never impressed by Parrot&#x27;s original AR Drone, but this looks much more promising as an accessible drone with a good feature set. The biggest problem with the AR Drone, the control latency over WiFi, is probably covered up by the Bebop&#x27;s GPS stabilization.<p>It doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s any pricing information for the  Bebop yet. They should definitely be able to keep it under $500, and if so (and if it works as well as their demos portray) I bet they&#x27;ll sell well.",1401692140

With Opera, I just throw my mouse to the top of the screen and drag. With Firefox and Chrome, I have to search out a tiny 20 pixel wide hitbox between the end of the tabs and the minimize button to start the drag action.\nEvery single windows application I&#x27;ve used respects this mechanic, except for Chrome and Firefox.

7832205,comment,7828873,7828873,2,0,k0,,,"A few things.  Talk to a counselor (psychologist) to vent and vet the issues that led to your past depression and begin a treatment plan.  Everyone has problems, some choose those problems, some choose to move on, and some choose to contemplate suicide like yourself (and some actually commit suicide).  Just as you sought assistance here, call around and get an appointment.<p>Do many small things that build into bigger things.  You had mentioned LEGO.  Make 1 small shed.  Done.  Make 1 small house.  Done.  Make another house.  Done.  Make a city.  Done.  Make another city. Done.  Make a world.  Done.  One LEGO a time.  One line of code at a time.  One hamburger at a time.<p>Ideas are great, and plentiful.  Execution is the hard part.  Which is better: McDonald&#x27;s, Burger King, Subway, Wendy&#x27;s, Sonic, Whole Foods Deli, or your local choices of hamburger joints?  Who cares who was there first, learn from them and leverage the differences.  You&#x27;re an American.  We have been subjected to the greatest Marketing machine on the planet since birth...look at all of the competition for damn near anything.  Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy&#x27;s, was a dyslexic orphan who stumbled around creating his empire...and it started with one pretty crappy store (restaurant) in Columbus, Ohio.  Was Wendy&#x27;s the only game in town?  Did Wendy&#x27;s not have any competition locally, nationally, or globally?  WHO CARES!  He forged ahead and died a Billionaire.  When Dave was born did anyone think Dave Thomas could even run a Hamburger store or that his potential (or destiny) would be owning thousands of hamburger stores?  Probably not.  He threw his all into something and despite the failures, loss of market share, fighting healthy menu choices, etc. he still did something.  Arguably, the Dave Thomas Foundation is what his true potential/destiny would be.<p>Your potential is not something you live up to, it is something you live.  The imaginary apex of potential is well, imaginary.  It is also so one-dimensional as to be transparent.  Focus on living right, whatever that means to you, and the rest will come.<p>To answer your questions: \n1. Never give up on getting back up. Note the &quot;results&quot; (not the &quot;failure&quot;, that&#x27;s called learning), and say aloud, &quot;Next.&quot; If you &quot;fail&quot; a test do you break down and cry?  No, if you&#x27;re smart you review the test and study the gaps in your knowledge and comprehension. Are the &quot;results&quot; random, or did you fail to plan?<p>2. I have seen many of &quot;my ideas&quot; eventually end up on the market. It&#x27;s called validation not theft.  What prevented me from getting there first or being a contender?  All this BS about first to market is cute and does not prevent you, me, or anyone from doing it better, faster, cheaper.<p>This financial company you work for...are they the only financial company in the US or the world?  Are they really that badass?  Let&#x27;s assume you are working for a bank, what company was the last disruptor?  Ally?  ING?  Stripe maybe?  ATMs are going the way of the dodo...I know, I worked for the big three (Diebold, NCR, and Fujitsu)...and they are scared as shit with all of the cashless, swipe, tap, bitcoin, online mortgages, email funds, etc.  Point: Everyone&#x27;s ideas will get to market eventually.  Sometimes the idea comes with an alloy of passion, persistence, and good timing for you or someone else.  Competition is good, as is using technology to pivot.<p>3: Burnout: take it easy, go camping, get away, read a book.  Take many small breaks.  Take a vacation.  Take it easy.  Have dreams, and live them.<p>4: Brogrammers and sexism...who cares.  I put up with all kind of -isms and societal BS everyday.  Welcome to society.  I&#x27;m not sure what your issues are, but I just focus on my concerns.<p>5: I love bubble talk.  It is very remedial.  What goes up, must come down...but what aspects?  Again, focus on your concerns.  When one bubble pops another starts growing.",1401691805

You can walk right up to the crater&#x27;s edge without protection, while the oil well fires radiate so much heat you can&#x27;t even get close.

In the worst case, if an obstructionist minority of states were to block an overwhelmingly popular and desperately needed amendment, a sufficiently large number of states could simply write a new Constitution.  After all, that&#x27;s exactly how the current U.S. Constitution got put into place.<p>The Articles of Confederation could only be amended by unanimous vote of all 13 states.  And of course, they needed unanimity to amend the unanimity clause.  So it was an amendment clause without loopholes.<p>But only 12 states showed up at the Constitutional Convention!  Unanimity was obviously not going to happen.<p>So the delegates wrote a new Constitution anyway, and specified a ratification threshold of 9 states.  Once this threshold had been reached, the other 4 states could have fun governing their rump country under the old Articles.  But the ratifying states would be in a customs union and have a strong central government, and they could make do just fine without the holdouts.<p>In the end, only two states held out.  Eventually, both gave in.  North Carolina didn&#x27;t even last a year on its own.  Rhode Island lasted 15 months.<p>The same people who pulled off this stunt also wrote the Constitution.

I was raised in a very religious family that has negatively impacted my life in a few ways. I guess I see the damage of religion in more places than most.<p>But inflammatory? I think that&#x27;s the point of the PG essay I referenced: that just saying something &quot;you can&#x27;t say&quot; automatically makes it inflammatory. The statement&#x27;s truth is irrelevant.<p>&quot;Your comment annoyed me also for its obviousness and vague smugness&quot;<p>For someone who has a lot of very religious friends, I don&#x27;t think this is obvious to many people.

Before the digital age kids like myself just did not have access to many things that could get them into so much trouble. I caused my share of mischief when I was a kid, just like most boys will do. Probably the worst tools I had at my disposal were eggs or snowballs to throw at cars. The opportunity for me to reach out from my bedroom and cause damage to a multi-national corporation or government just was not available to me or anybody at the time. It&#x27;s hard to imagine what I could have done as a kid to even get the attention of the FBI, let alone have them trying to trap me in a sting operation. Kids today have a lot more ways to do some serious damage and get themselves into real trouble.",1401689345

But....<p>The moment you have to &quot;enforce&quot; or &quot;defend&quot; a contract you&#x27;ve essentially lost.<p>Do you trust the other party? If not, then no contract will save you.<p>The other thing I strongly suggest is to limit the amount of work you do prior to getting paid. You should keep a slim amount of work (none, if possible) that hasn&#x27;t been paid for.<p>Always think in worst case scenarios and assume anything that&#x27;s completed but not paid for can be withheld.",1401689268

This is equivalent to attaching\n         new_device, waiting for it to resilver, and then detaching\n         old_device.\n\n         The size of new_device must be greater than or equal to the minimum\n         size of all the devices in a mirror or raidz configuration.\n\n         new_device is required if the pool is not redundant. If new_device is\n         not specified, it defaults to old_device.  This form of replacement\n         is useful after an existing disk has failed and has been physically\n         replaced. In this case, the new disk may have the same /dev path as\n         the old device, even though it is actually a different disk.  ZFS\n         recognizes this.\n\n         -f      Forces use of new_device, even if its appears to be in use.\n                 Not all devices can be overridden in this manner.</code></pre>",1401689232

I expect Apple&#x27;s predicted &quot;iWatch&quot; is actually going to be an &quot;iBand&quot; and is going to be a simple, elegant wristband (likely with a minimal or non-existent display) that is meant to augment the functionality of iOS 8 on your iPhone through the use of always-on sensors that measure heart rate, etc. The announcement of iOS 8 seems to be the proper venue to introduce this device since my guess is a lot of the focus in iOS 8 will seem misplaced unless you consider the value of this companion device.<p>In turn, I expect there to be the usual major backlash that Apple did not release a unicorn Dick Tracy watch from the future. Many folks will say that Nike, Fitbit, etc, already did this. But Apple&#x27;s will be better designed and incredibly tightly integrated. There will also probably be some genuine novel parts to it, most likely around recharging (solar/wireless? Never take it off?) and the ability for the person to customize how the device looks. There will probably also be a few other applications beyond fitness and health. (Payments?) Ultimately I&#x27;d guess it will eventually be worn by most folks who buy the latest Apple phones. I expect it to be relatively cheap compared to most new Apple products, prob $149 or something. When iPhone 6 hits you&#x27;ll probably be able to buy one for $99 or something when you buy the phone.",1401688955
