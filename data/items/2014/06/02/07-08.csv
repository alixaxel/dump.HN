Also related, OSX menu items have a gap between them; clicking on that gap closes the menu (I <i>think</i>). I cannot think of any good reason for that, only bad ones. It&#x27;s infuriating when an OS gets so many usability things right, then falls down on the hugely obvious bits.",1401695881

Never felt better in my life using windows (it also does other stuff like allow alt+right-drag to resize and the option to remove all windows borders).<p>Here&#x27;s the program in case anybody is interested but keep in mind it can have a few bugs and I stopped using/working on it because I don&#x27;t use Windows anymore.

There&#x27;s still a ways to go, but the movement has been amazing; it&#x27;s been thrilling.<p>And now this?!  There are so many shots I have in my head that I could pull off with this.

But for the trajectories, you could also contract someone that worked remotely, to whom you could draw out the trajectory you want or model in another way, and be your camera operator.  (Wouldn&#x27;t that be mind-blowing?  &quot;The camera operator on this film never left their home in Madagascar.&quot;)  Really -- I&#x27;ve just seen the future, and as a (hobbyist) film maker, I&#x27;m ecstatic at the potential!",1401695849

7832359,comment,7831879,7832195,10,0,weland,,,"I used Plan 9 continuously for one summer, a while ago, when I was in high school. It&#x27;s a nice environment, but certainly not something that could be used for day-to-day computing. I still needed another computer for almost anything that did not involve coding. I don&#x27;t remember if that was before or after they open sourced it, but I distinctly remember poking around the source code during another summer. It&#x27;s a pleasure to read it. They ignored a lot of received wisdom and the result is an elegant, if unpolished and occasionally buggy, system. IMHO it would have made much more of an impact if it had not been kept on a leash by Bell Labs.<p>I still use Acme occasionally and some of the bunch of scripts I use are in rc. Acme is a beautiful editor that doesn&#x27;t get in my way much, but the mouse-only interface is fairly clunky and I don&#x27;t have the time and energy to keep my own patches over it for sane (ahem, emacs) bindings. I use it, occasionally, as a distraction when working on a more boring project, or when I just have to write long streams of text that don&#x27;t require much jumping around.",1401695730

7832342,comment,7830959,7831863,1,0,nospecinterests,,,"Natural gas is not being switched out for coal. At least not in the USA. I think that might be a typo. I unfortunately can not site a fancy link like you have but from experience I can tell you that the actual costs I have encountered for projects showed that the price of scrubber tech/equipment (and installation) was less then the cost of a plant conversion from coal to natural gas.<p>The costs of coal are higher than they were before and are growing. This is a direct result of government regulation. The other problem is that these regulations and the continual call for more is causing a great deal of market uncertainty, which is also driving up costs (not just for the coal but for equipment). Natural gas is currently not in the same position, it is cheaper and less regulated (no mining regulations/legislation). Further, because there has been so much drilled for there is a surplus (supply and demand ==> gas costs are lower). This is mostly because of the lack of good, viable, stable export terminals. So when some terminals open in the future we will see higher natural gas prices.",1401695319

7832329,comment,7832056,7832056,8,0,timmorgan,,,"Kudos on picking up and moving forward an existing Rails plugin gem rather than writing yet another. Too many Rails gems get left in the dust after a few years. CanCan is a great library, and is well-documented!<p>That being said, I&#x27;ve found (the hard way) that how CanCan declares &quot;abilities&quot; isn&#x27;t flexible enough. The declarations got out of hand as my app grew larger and the maze of who can do what got more complex.<p>CanCan tries to reduce complex authorization logic down to a very simple DSL. I applaud the effort, but it falls apart on larger apps.<p>(I am perfectly willing to admit that I probably just &quot;did it wrong&quot;, but in the end, I decided something less clever and more along the lines of &quot;just Ruby&quot; would be more up my alley.)<p>I&#x27;ve switched over to using the Authority gem [1] for authorization, which doesn&#x27;t try to be quite so clever. You write your authorization logic in plain ol&#x27; Ruby code -- use an `if` or a `case` or look up in the database, or whatever!<p>The best part of CanCan (IMO) is its ability to load and authorize your resource model in a filter in your controller, removing much of the boilerplate you get with Rails resource controllers. I would hope that functionality could be extracted from CanCan (or CanCanCan) into a separate gem.<p>In the meantime, I ended up writing my own library called (unimaginatively) &quot;load_and_authorize_resource&quot; [2] to do basically the same thing.

7832327,comment,7831291,7831950,3,0,drdaeman,,,"As for computer games, I believe there are two ways to effectively combat any &quot;cheating&quot;:<p>1. Restrict what clients see and do, server-side. Many cheats rely on the fact, client game software internally has much more information that it presents to the player (wallhacks, radars/ESPs, etc), and server trusts client-originating data more than it should (speedhacks, norecoils, spawners, etc).<p>I know, those&#x27;re due to attempts to reduce network-induced lags and lowering server loads, but having a more powerful server-side (and have an occasional desync if network lags badly) doesn&#x27;t sound like an unacceptable trade-off to not have players upset by cheaters.<p>2. Embrace cheats as features and raise everyone abilities to best cheater&#x27;s ones. There&#x27;s no need to, say, have an aimbot if you have an &quot;official&quot; in-game ability to have autoaim.<p>Maybe then we&#x27;ll finally have scriptable/hackable games, where one could &quot;legally&quot; automate routine tasks and be on a &quot;good&quot; side.

And it&#x27;s so much easier to reason that way, which is not a fault of vi&#x27;s grammar but arguably a fault of most programming languages&#x27; grammars. It&#x27;s that fabled saying that you should rather have one data structure (sexps) with 100 operations on it than 10 structures (words, lines, bracketed expressions, paras) with 10 operations each.<p>This really can&#x27;t be overstated.<p>Even if you don&#x27;t really use Paredit or any kind of special tool S-expressions lend themselves to easy modification. Since a Lisp program is, by virtue of the structure, organized by default into easily separated components there is no need to think about anything else other than just expressions.<p>When I write Racket code (in Emacs), I organize and move code in expressions instead, and if I wanted to move a certain expression I would just move to the enclosing paren and hold shift while saying &quot;move to matching paren&quot; and the whole expression will be marked and I can do whatever I want with it.<p>I used to use vim before and while I did &quot;get it&quot; after a while I switched to Emacs when I started learning Lisp because I figured I could immerse myself in Lisp code with Emacs.<p>The thing about it is that since I&#x27;ve coded almost exclusively in Lisps since then I haven&#x27;t really needed what vim does best. At some point a while ago there were a slew of posts about vim and I looked at maybe getting evil-mode for emacs, but I don&#x27;t know if I see the point when I almost exclusively deal with sexps.",1401694549

I would sigh somewhat heavily, shake my head in disbelief and then it would be back to Linux with a touch of Windows (and possibly Android) on the side. Not my first preference obviously, but not such a bad thing all in all.",1401692787

I had a physics class where one of the books had the teacher&#x27;s name in it x_X, and he was near retirement age.<p>When the recession hit a lot of students asked teachers whether the earlier edition texts were still okay for class. Most of my teachers completely understood the situation students are in financially, one teacher went on a tirade against the school&#x27;s bookstore.",1401692750

I&#x27;ll quote for you:<p><i>We may imagine that we are a great deal smarter and more virtuous than past generations, but the more history you read, the less likely this seems.... I suspect the only taboos that are more than taboos are the ones that are universal, or nearly so. Murder for example. But any idea that&#x27;s considered harmless in a significant percentage of times and places, and yet is taboo in ours, is a good candidate for something we&#x27;re mistaken about.</i><p>To make it clear: thinking particular taboos are caused by religion is shortsighted. These things keep happening over & over again, and unfortunately &quot;progress&quot; isn&#x27;t always towards something you may like.<p><i>However</i>, human sacrifice (aka murder) is a taboo that is shared by many cultures. That makes that different to the other things you lists.",1401692699
