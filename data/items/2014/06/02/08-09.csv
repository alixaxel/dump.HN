I have a Phantom (v1.1) and it&#x27;s fantastic; a friend just bought the v2 which is even greater.<p>Among the differences: the Phantom has an actual radio, with ranges of over 500m (it would be very surprising if Wifi covered the advertised 300m of this new Parrot); you can change cameras as you wish (or, after a crash), it can fly really high and really fast, etc.<p>You can get a Phantom 1 for under $350 these days (without a gimbal), or a 2+ (camera and gimbal included) for around $1000. I would recommend buying the 2 without gimbal ($550) and the Zenmuse gimbal ($150-$200) -- and if you already have a GoPro you&#x27;re all set.<p>Alternatively, you can buy a Hubsan H107D FPV which comes with a radio with a screen, for under $150! I don&#x27;t own that one, but I have the Hubsan X4 which is a lot of fun (and completely safe to fly indoors).",1401699355

Oddly, said terminal exposes the contents of the scrollback buffer—both read and write—to a file, which is how the native Plan 9 history mechanisms work.

These types of opt-in solutions are mostly irrelevant, because the people interested in using them are already displaying the required level of responsibility.<p>The root of the problem is not distraction, it&#x27;s a lack of respect, education and enforcement of existing traffic law.<p>I live in a tiny suburb of a medium-sized city, which is billed as pedestrian-friendly. Unfortunately, the two-lane road leading through the village is relatively one of the busiest in the city, as it is the most direct non-toll route for commuters south of the city.<p>The solutions created by the municipality to make the streets pedestrian-friendly all require participation by both the driver and pedestrian. And they never work.<p>For example, the village has several crosswalks which are not at intersections. All of these have fluorescent signs placed in the middle of the road, reminding drivers that pedestrians have the right of way. However, you can routinely wait at one of these crosswalks longer than it would take to walk to an intersection and wait for the light to change. I&#x27;ve watched women who are visibly pregnant and/or with strollers wait multiple minutes for someone to stop and let them cross. And even then they&#x27;re not guaranteed to have people stop who are driving in the other direction, forcing them to stand awkwardly and dangerously in the middle of the road.<p>Almost immediately after a recent vehicle-pedestrian accident, the village placed poles holding several fluorescent orange flags at each of these non-intersection crosswalks, in an attempt to increase pedestrian visibility. Even while waving one of these flags, approximately 1 in 15 drivers will acknowledge someone is at the crosswalk and stop for them.<p>This is on top of all the illegal right-on-reds, ubiquitous failing to signal, and all of the other violations that people don&#x27;t care about anymore. Partially because they are almost never enforced and everyone knows they can get away with it, but also because people just simply don&#x27;t give a fuck about other people. Those same 14 out of 15 people who refuse to acknowledge basic traffic laws will never participate in opt-in solutions.<p>So, unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see how the solution will ever be technical. It can only be through education, increased standards and enforcement of those standards that roads will become safer.",1401696938
