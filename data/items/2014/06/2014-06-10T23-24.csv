What Spicer calls a &quot;Main Street Entrepreneur&quot; is what I like to call a &quot;micropreneur&quot;: The spirit, freedom of how/when/where but bootstrapped, without VCs involved. And instead of just working on one big thing hopping to make it big, one can work on a few smaller &quot;micro businesses&quot;, which cumulatively might not make you rich, but can you make at least viable, self-sustained and more importantly, free and happy to pursue other things; be that trying out another micro-business, or recreational freedom. I can&#x27;t tell you how great it is to be able to just go on a vacation or road trip when you feel like it without having to wonder &quot;how many vacation days do I have left; need a few for christmas etc.&quot; and even having to ask your boss to get permission to take a few days off to begin with.

Entry level jobs in shitty places get you arround u$d7500/8000 a year. First job in a big company after you graduate gets you arround u$d11000/year, and with 2 or 3 years of experience you can get u$d15000/year easily if you are worth the investment. Upper tier jobs (manager, project leader or research for a big corporation, working remotely for someone in the US/Europe, consulting) start in u$d20000/year and can easily get to u$d30000/year.<p>That is using Argentina&#x27;s and Venezuela&#x27;s black market exchange rate, or Brazil&#x27;s official one.<p>In Argentina even a PhD candidate gets more than u$d5000 a year from his publicly funded University.

Do they work for an enterprise SaaS/vendor or for an actual enterprise, aka big businesses that use software? I don&#x27;t think either of those are particularly better paid than the other groups.<p>I think it&#x27;s more likely that the best paid programmers are working in a field with specialized software that only runs on Windows. For example, EEs use Windows almost universally for Altium/Cadence/Mentor Graphics software which means that the majority of commercial firmware compilers and IDEs are Windows only too (even though many are forks of cross platform tools). The same is pretty much true of biotech too: a majority of the software that interfaces with hardware, especially lab automation, is on Windows so anyone dealing with those specialized fields would be start with Windows and run VMs for everything else.<p>Another explanation would be hardware support. My workstation has a high end but not a server mobo (with funky features like Marvell&#x27;s weird simulated RAID) and dual SLI K-series GPUs (professional/super computing). Getting Ubuntu 14.04 to even boot up, let alone properly deal with monitors and peripherals like a 3D mouse coming and going, takes at best an entire work day.
