So they&#x27;re going to drive too fast. Meanwhile, other idiots who <i>don&#x27;t</i> have it will also drive too fast. It&#x27;s only a matter of time before someone in a Genesis enters a camera zone and auto-brakes while another speeding idiot on a cellphone is tail-gating them. Result: a high-speed pile-up.<p>Something not-dissimilar happened with the first roll-out of ABS on cars; drivers who knew their brakes were super-strong drove too fast and actually ended up with a <i>higher</i> accident rate, at least at first. But ABS was a pure safety feature (to prevent your brakes locking up on a slippery surface or if engaged too hard). This ... I lack words to describe how inadvisable I think it is to seek to avoid a small fine in return for an elevated risk of high-speed vehicle-to-vehicle collisions.<p>(The risk can be reduced if the Genesis has <i>rear</i> facing radar to prevent shunts, or begins to brake gently some distance ahead of the camera zone. It&#x27;s also mitigated if tail-gating idiots drive cars with adaptive cruise control -- that maintains constant separation from the vehicle ahead regardless of speed. But as not all cars have the latest features it&#x27;ll take an automobile generation for this stuff to spread out and become ubiquitous. Meanwhile, sooner or later, people will die.)",1403837049

I naturally slow down in residential areas, and speed up for highways. Generally this is 75mph or so in my area with a speed limit of 65mph.

But that&#x27;s the point of architecture in the first place, to be there for you when things change.  The focus of architects should be to ensure that changes are <i>as easy as possible</i> and not to have an <i>elegant design</i>.  I&#x27;ve seen some of the most elegant designs that are easy to maintain <i>trashed</i> due to changes in user requirements or changes to the market place.<p>For this reason I advocate, and have advocated since I started developing in the early 90s, micro service/modular architectures.  Java OSGi is currently my favorite environment (though I&#x27;m also investigating similar approaches in Clojure), but I&#x27;ve done this with C/C++ in the past as well using shared objects/dlls as the modularity mechanism.<p>Good architectures adapt to change, they doesn&#x27;t stay the same with time.",1403836123

A road can, and does, have speeders all day and not a single accident.<p>I&#x27;m still going to hit a person/car if they do something stupid on the road if I am speeding or not.<p>If you need any supporting facts that they are only for profit, there is more research in red-light cameras. They have shown that they can cause <i>more</i> accidents because people try to avoid going through the intersection &quot;just in case&quot; they don&#x27;t make it all the way through and get a ticket. This causes aggressive braking and accidents. It also doesn&#x27;t help that a lot of states will shorten the length of the Yellow light at these intersections to ensure more people will go through them. Yay for safety.<p>As for speeding cameras, my state recently took one down due to backlash because they installed a camera 100ft before a speed increase sign. The &quot;tickets&quot; (I quote that because they are usually fines, and not really tickets, and usually do not cause points to be put on your license if your state has that system) included a photograph of their car passing the new speed limit sign.<p>The state admitted no wrong doing, and believe it was a great spot to put the camera.

7952453,comment,7895504,7899816,1,0,afthonos,,,"The code works, but the type of the generic is not guaranteed at compile time. FunctorResult could be anything at all. There is no compile-time obligation for the code to return a Dictionary<KeyType, P>.<p>The more canonical example of a Functor is really the Optional. The mapping method for an optional looks like this:<p><pre><code>  func fmap(f: A -> B) -> Optional<B> {\n    switch self {\n    case Some(let a):\n      return Some(f(A))\n    case None:\n      return None\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nHowever, with your protocol, I can define the mapping function for the Optional as:<p><pre><code>  func fmap(f: A -> B) -> B[] {\n    switch self {\n    case Some(let a):\n      return [f(A)]\n    case None:\n      return B[]()\n    }\n  }\n</code></pre>\nThis would pass the type-checker, but is not what a Functor does.",1403834794

Why? It&#x27;s not viable without up-front automation investment, ongoing maintenance overheads, and additional latency and inefficiency, for starters. It&#x27;s also probably less portable, particularly to embedded systems.<p><i>it makes little sense to add to the complexity and attack surface to add a process monitor per container and an sshd per container</i><p>Process monitor? What are you talking about? At least with LXC, each container has PID 1 (master application process, init system, whatever) and can be stopped/started easily with <i>lxc-stop -n nameofcontainer</i>.<p>As for sshd, my point was that it can make sense because it&#x27;s secure, remote-accessible, proven. The article premise was that it&#x27;s a bad idea, but none of its arguments hold, to my mind.<p><i>Both are easily abstracted behind tiny (1-2 line) scripts...</i><p>That aren&#x27;t remotely accessible, without breaking the abstraction and creating some shared access scenario on the host. The <i>entire point</i> of an abstraction is to be clean. It&#x27;s not clean if you have to adopt hacky workarounds and dump all of your existing tools in order to play with it.",1403834654
