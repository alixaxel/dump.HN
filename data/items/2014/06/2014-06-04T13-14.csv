7845544,comment,7842282,7844439,3,0,jonnathanson,,,"That perception is not entirely without merit, but it&#x27;s a little dated. Steve Blank, fwiw, teaches and lectures at the MBA programs at both Stanford and Berkeley. MBA programs, like those and many others, are actively embracing his methodology, and methodologies like his.<p>Modern, top-tier MBA programs are increasingly driven by entrepreneurship, and less by traditional, hidebound business courses and corporate line-management skills. A lot has changed, and much of it changed in reaction to the embarrassments of the late &#x27;90s. Furthermore, engineers make up an increasingly large percentage of MBA cohorts these days; the old MBA/engineer dichotomy could use a refresh. The two skill sets -- engineering and analytical business strategy -- are often quite complementary. MBA programs have recognized as much, and today, being an engineer is a serious advantage in an MBA curriculum.<p>That&#x27;s not to say you won&#x27;t find your fair share of entitled, naive, or opportunistic MBA students in any given program. They&#x27;re still around. But their numbers are dwindling, because many industries (finance and consulting notwithstanding) have realized they don&#x27;t want that type. In time, these people will become the exceptions, and not the rule. That may already be the case at many MBA programs.<p>I&#x27;m not here to play apologist for the reputation MBAs have earned in the tech world. A lot of it has been deserved. At the same time, a lot of it is no longer as fair or accurate an assessment as it once was.",1401890312

The imperative subset of Scala is really familiar to Swift, you&#x27;re absolutely right (+1 for posting that comparison). However, real-world Scala is different.

7845525,comment,7844882,7844882,5,0,NateDad,,,"Here&#x27;s why Go&#x27;s errors are better than exceptions:<p>Multithreaded environments make exception handling next to impossible to do correctly.  The stack trace only shows a single thread which is often useless without more context.  Exceptions are per-thread, so handling has to be per-thread.<p>Exceptions make the control flow of your program completely obscure.  Any line that calls out to another function can cause this function to exit.  If you&#x27;re not wrapping every function call in a try/finally, you&#x27;re probably doing it wrong (at which point it&#x27;s even more verbose than go&#x27;s error returns).<p>Errors in Go aren&#x27;t special.  They&#x27;re just values returned from a function.  You have the whole language at your disposal to deal with them.<p>I can write this in Go, and it&#x27;s perfectly safe:<p><pre><code>  f, err := os.Open(filename)\n  if err != nil {\n     return fmt.Errorf(&quot;Failed to open config file: %s&quot;, err)\n  }\n  err = callFunctionThatMightErrorOut()\n  if err != nil {\n    // handle err\n  }\n  f.Close()\n</code></pre>\nI know that my code will ALWAYS close that file handle.  To do the same thing in a language with exceptions, you&#x27;d have to do something like this:<p><pre><code>  File f\n  try {\n      try {\n          f = os.Open(filename)\n      }\n      catch(Exception e) {\n          throw new Exception(string.Format(&quot;Failed to open config file: %s&quot;, e.Message))\n      }\n      try {\n          callFunctionThatMightErrorOut()\n      }\n      catch(Exception e) {\n          // handle error\n      }\n  }\n  finally {\n      if f != nil {\n          f.Close()\n      }  \n  }\n</code></pre>\nNow who&#x27;s verbose?<p>The reason people think Go exception handling is verbose is because they aren&#x27;t really handling errors in their own code.  Go makes it easy to handle errors in the right way.",1401890121

Just a few months ago my Mom wanted me to buy a gift for my dad so that it didn&#x27;t show up on her card and so I ordered it and then after he had the gift she Venmo&#x27;d me the money. She didn&#x27;t have an account setup but I had the money in less than 10 minutes.

It just goes to show that what I think of as &quot;someone I would expect to use Venmo&quot; is wrong/outdated.<p>I&#x27;m really excited to see Venmo get used more and more as it makes my life extremely more simple when it comes to paying friend back or getting paid back.

Why ? Because a student union tried to create a second political party (and was succeeding). And no one cares today. The US has a long, long way to fall before getting to that level.<p>3) why is tracing cell phones such a problem ? How can anyone possibly believe anything other than that cell phones constantly broadcast who they are and their number to companies that are logging those broadcasts ? That&#x27;s how the fucking system works. The police can somewhat shortcut that process to get a little bit more accurate information.<p>Furthermore the main reason phones are broadcasting their location as accurately as possible is to aim antennas on them ... Why ? Because that way the carrier can support a greater density of phones and a greater density of antennas. Before long this will be accurate to within a few centimeters (and I don&#x27;t imagine it will stop there). If you want more bandwith on mobile, we have to do this.<p>I feel this is like complaining your car sometimes drives ...

Suppose a company is buying laptop computers to accomplish some task. If the company is willing to offer great pay - a high price - in exchange for laptop computers, they will easily find laptops, but they won&#x27;t choose to buy more laptops simply because a lot of vendors submitted bids. Right?<p>Going back a bit, it&#x27;s not true about either workers or laptops that &quot;demand is always equally present&quot;. And it is true about both workers and laptops that &quot;the supply is [somewhat, in the short term] limited and independent of the demand&quot;.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t get the point you&#x27;re trying to make. People respond to incentives. If companies can hire people for less than the value of their labor product, companies will expand and try to hire <i>more</i> people. If they can&#x27;t, companies will contract and hire fewer. In the extreme cases supply fluctuates via emigration/immigration. People have a reserve price - they generally aren&#x27;t willing to work unless offered enough to make it worth their while, just as they aren&#x27;t willing to sell a bicycle unless offered enough on eBay to make it worthwhile. Sometimes that price is less than the minimum, and sometimes it&#x27;s more, in which case the minimum becomes irrelevant because it&#x27;s less than the market rate.<p>I think I&#x27;m done looking up specific numbers for you; it never makes any difference to your views. Yes, collective bargaining exists in some sectors in Europe - it exists in some sectors in the US too! But there&#x27;s no national minimum in those countries, which is what matters most for general employment. (And yes, these things are always in flux. Switzerland just last month voted on whether to have a $25/hour minimum, but 75% of the electorate voted against it - common sense prevailed for once!)",1401889600

7845374,comment,7838450,7844720,1,0,glenra,,,"> no reason for all of them, or even a majority, to loose more in benefits than they gain in higher pay. makes no sense.<p>I&#x27;m not sure you understand the argument here: A job is a bundle of benefits. There&#x27;s a money component but there&#x27;s also all sorts of tangible and intangible other factors that are of value to the worker and cost money to the employer. Other factors might include things like: Free food. Free training. Company-provided uniforms. A well-lit work environment. Flexible hours. Sick leave. Vacation time (paid or unpaid). A well-lit and clean and safe work environment. Job security. A 401k plan. Health coverage. Convenient employee parking. Educational assistance. Prescription drug discounts.<p>Suppose the value of your work to the company is $16/hour, of which you get paid $10 in salary, $5 in benefits, and the company keeps $1 as profit. If the minimum wage is increased to $15/hour, the only way the company can afford to keep you on is to get rid of ALL the benefits; they would then pay you $15 in salary and $0 in benefits.<p>The problem is that if you had WANTED that deal you could have BARGAINED for it. You CHOSE a 10/5 salary/benefit split because that&#x27;s what you preferred, so when the government forces you to take a 15/0 split instead you are being forced to accept a deal you like LESS than your prior option. You&#x27;re worse off.<p>Yes, you&#x27;re making $15/hour, but now you have to work HARDER and the work conditions are worse and the timing is less flexible and the schedule is less relaxed and the job security is nonexistent and you have to pay for your own food and uniform and training and so on where before those were all provided. It is now a <i>miserable job</i> even at the higher wage, where before it was an okay job with a merely not-great wage.<p>But wait, I hear you cry: &quot;minimum wage workers have no negotiating power so they can&#x27;t just demand exactly what they want!&quot;<p>Ah, but they kind of can. They do so not by arguing with employers directly but merely by CHOOSING employers. When considering whether to work at McDonald&#x27;s or Burger King, workers look at the whole package and pick the one they like MORE. (The company cares about the SUM, not how much is salary versus benefits - it just wants to get the best workers they can at a low OVERALL cost) Over time, the company that offers a better overall blend of benefits+salary will find it easier to hire the people they need so the packages offered will tend to evolve to best meet the needs of the average workers.<p>Then the government steps in and says screw that, you can&#x27;t HAVE those benefits anymore, because the company can&#x27;t afford to give them to you along with your new higher salary.<p>If the minimum wage went from $10 to $15, people whose value to the company was between those two simply lose their jobs; people whose value to the company was $16 or more keep their job but the job is now a really crappy one they (according to revealed preference) probably like less than what they had before. So they aren&#x27;t actually made better off by the change, even though they got a raise.<p>Which means there&#x27;s no net benefit to the higher wage, only costs.<p>> <i>key word being &quot;presumably&quot;, which is, given the election results in Seattle, apparently not true</i><p>Election results are mostly about signaling and group affiliation. They don&#x27;t tell us anything about what minimum wage workers want, because minimum wage workers are such a small portion of the electorate.<p>> <i>measurement is king. if any losses will occur, they should be measurable.</i><p>Bad study design could easily render them unmeasurable in any particular study. And most minimum wage increases are essentially <i>designed</i> to be nearly unmeasurable by the sort of study you&#x27;re thinking of. Yes, the theory says that, all else being equal, businesses will tend to respond to higher labor costs by such measures as: cutting benefits, cutting shifts (so there are fewer <i>hours</i> but not necessarily fewer <i>jobs</i>), investing in automation, shrinking or failing to expand, not opening (as many) new businesses. But theory doesn&#x27;t say exactly WHEN this will happen or even in which business sectors. An exceptionally stupid study design might compare just the number of jobs right before the law takes effect to one year later, and find no effect. But wait: the law was argued about in the legislature for two years and then passed but didn&#x27;t take effect until the next calendar year, and took effect in multiple small stages. A smart, pro-active businessman who knew he needed to make changes might see the writing on the wall and start making those business changes <i>before</i> the law even passes much less takes effect, confounding that study design. On the other hand, a lazy, re-active businessman might just suck it up and change nothing, losing some money for a year or two after the change, either hoping to make it work or hoping the law gets repealed. Eventually he is driven to make those changes but does so <i>after</i> the study window, again confounding the results. In short, what sort of delayed or premature response we should expect for a particular sector and a particular sort of legal change is an <i>empirical</i> question - you might have to run one study to find the shape of the expected response and then run another to estimate its magnitude. Doing the sort of thing Card/Krueger did is almost guaranteed to miss most of the signal, even if it&#x27;s really there.",1401888298

You download a new spreadsheet, with the model right in the Excel formulas. That lets you make predictions going forward.<p>Other services like this are really aiming at helping programmers to build models.  I wanted to make something that a regular non-programmer could use, to get insight into their data.<p>It is open for registration now with no invite needed (unless I get a big rush), so register now and have a play.<p>There are some examples on the site at https://www.predictobot.com/examples/ with little explainer videos.  You can play with the results directly, see https://www.predictobot.com/examples/3/ for instance.

7845279,comment,7837495,7840742,1,0,mercer,,,"In no particular order:<p><i></i>I learned a lot of uncomfortable stuff about my behavior in a short time<i></i><p>These were things that I had never noticed before, despite being a very introspective, reflective person (and a psychologist to boot). And I think the relationship was key to that. While my friendships also uncover new truths about myself, I can generally keep things as superficial as I desire, and I have a lot of control over when to see my friends, in what context, and for how long. Relationships (generally) have a tendency to break out of those patterns, uncovering a lot in a short time.<p>This has proved so beneficial that I don&#x27;t even regret some of the truly toxic and emotionally harrowing situations I&#x27;ve been in. No pain, no gain, I guess.<p><i></i>For certain things of varying importance, I could rely on my &#x27;significant other&#x27;. A form of symbiosis, I guess<i></i><p>I am not a practical or very, uh, physical man. When I&#x27;m caught up in something, I forget to eat (or eat healthily), I forget to do my laundry or clean my house, I forget to meet friends (either for my benefit, theirs, or both of ours), or I forget to even just go outside.<p>And once I break out of this obsession, I often realize in hindsight that it wasn&#x27;t always worth forgetting that other stuff. And yet I keep doing this, and from looking at my father, this is quite possibly something I cannot break out of without <i>significant</i> effort. Effort that I&#x27;d rather spend on other things.<p>When I was in a relationship with someone who was different enough in these regards, but similar enough to not cause too much friction, my life improved immensely, including the efficacy of the targets of my obsessions. It turns out a balanced life is usually better :).<p>While this might be an extreme example and you might not identify with this, I think most people have their blind spots, and while my previous point could arguably be &#x27;solved&#x27; by fixing the <i>flaws</i>, it is much harder (and perhaps less desirable) to &#x27;fix&#x27; these <i>personality traits</i>.<p><i></i>Sex, physical intimacy, and a direct &#x27;responsibility&#x27; to another person is generally a fundamental aspect of being human<i></i><p>I am happy alone. Truly happy. I also probably have a lower libido than most. I don&#x27;t understand people who can&#x27;t be alone or need sex all the time and will put up with terrible partners or consequences to achieve this.<p>And yet, I learned that while I am perhaps unusual in this regard, it&#x27;s quite likely that to some degree I <i>learned</i> to be happy alone, and I <i>learned</i> to be happy without having sex very often, but this might not be my ideal state. And experimenting in this regard has given me a more nuanced view of myself, where I realize that the hug I get might be exactly the one I needed, even though I didn&#x27;t feel like that before I got the hug (for example).<p>The bottom-line is that I&#x27;ve known many people in relationships and I&#x27;ve known many people without them. Happiness is perhaps as closely related to being in one or the other category as we often think, but there <i>is</i> a relation, in my opinion.<p>&#x27;Norms&#x27; can be at the very least informative as to what is <i>likely</i> a healthy approach. And my personal experience with people who have no (romantic) relationships, or for that matter people who have no friends, is that especially later in life they seem to grow in a way that does not seem to make them happier. More successful perhaps, or more valuable to society, but often obviously (to me) less happy. Loneliness is a terrible affliction, and can sneak up on you.<p>Whether you want to take the risk of being &#x27;on your own&#x27; (in whichever particular form you choose) depends partly on your desired outcome, of course. Newton was a recluse, but perhaps he lived the most fulfilling and happy life he could have led, and at the very least he was very important to the world (in my opinion).<p>For me, I don&#x27;t want to take such a risk without having experimented with the alternatives. I might very well choose to remain alone for much of my life, but at least I have (some) idea of what I might be missing out on, and some experience and skill to reconsider my choices later (which can be hard if you have no experience in this regard).<p>That said, I&#x27;m still young and I might be full of shit... :-). Ask me again in a few decades!<p>(also, perhaps the key point is that I didn&#x27;t always greatly desire a relationship and I didn&#x27;t always <i>like</i> the person. Especially the first time, it was a conscious choice to try something big, new, and potentially dangerous, but less dangerous than I had initially thought).",1401886958
