In the dream I would would focus on taking in the behavior of light and texture on surfaces and trying to gauge its quality from a computer graphics perspective, and always found the &#x27;simulation&#x27; absolutely stunning. I remember encountering a large rabbit once and ran my fingers through it&#x27;s fur and it felt and looked real. It&#x27;s mindboggling how well the brain can simulate a fake environment when you go lucid, it&#x27;s really beyond comprehension to me how it&#x27;s able to do so. The brain can basically simulate the rendering equation in real time (or trick yourself into thinking it is, which is the same thing really.)",1402199806

I&#x27;m sure a used digger would not be considered legal fill-dirt material and they would be forced to dig it out and re-do the whole lot if it was buried in place. I remember when I was a kid in California the apartment I lived in filled in a pool and they had to bust up the concrete. Someone threw an old couch or stuffed chair or similar down in the hole and they just threw the dirt over it. The city found out and made them dig it out and fill it with proper fill-dirt. I believe the reason was that something might eventually be built on top of that area and it had to be up to code.",1402199798

They even mention it at the end of the blog post. That is also clear in the documentation.<p><a href=""https://www.rabbitmq.com/distributed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rabbitmq.com/distributed.html</a><p>The big general question is how likely are you to encounter network partitions?<p>Aphyr believes they are very dangerous and likely to happen to you at some point and should be taken more seriously by the programming world.<p>I tend to take a more of &quot;it depends&quot; on your environment. Recently with VM and cloud deployment network partitions are quite likely. So they should be at the top of your &quot;things to worry about&quot; list.  But, I haven&#x27;t seen it happen on a local LAN. During testing I have induced it by hand (but pulling the network cable out from a switch), but I just haven&#x27;t seen it happen otherwise. I probably got lucky. Now I have seen other things come like memory corruption, memory leaks in software, and so on. So many other things that worry me more than network partition on a LAN.<p>All that said, it is great to see these experiments run. Please read and study all the other &quot;Call me maybe&quot; series. They are just very good. It turns out most products with a &quot;distributed&quot; component will fall over in the face of a partition. And keep in mind that it is best to have Aphyr discover these issues than your customers ;-)",1402199624

WA generates multiple programs that are possible interpretations of a given query and runs them all, or a pruned set of them, depending on out-of-query context (at least as far as I understand it). This is possible only for those cases without side effects. If some imperative code for calculating prime numbers surreptitiously has an instruction to launch a rocket, how would a naive user know?<p>In other words, such an intelligent system will need to distinguish between &quot;doing something&quot; and &quot;an instruction to do something&quot; - which is basically imperative languages versus monads.

In this mode, you can type and it records your typing. When you return to your desktop, you can tell the keyboard to play back your notes and it sends them to the computer as if you are typing them.<p>Optional feature: a one line LCD display so you can see your typing in note mode.<p>This gives the speed of typing, without the distraction of a laptop.",1402197295

It was treated more as a new age fringe thing back then, but I had a blast experimenting with it.  My favorite dreamscape involved a purely abstract state of mind where I could symbolically visualize components of algorithms -- nearly all of my work writing motion detection algorithms that worked in complex outdoor scenarios was refined in my sleep.<p>That being said, I eventually &quot;gave up&quot; lucid dreaming after 10 years or so.  At a gut level it felt like sleep and dreams are best left to the subconscious -- a neural defrag, if you will.  Personally I feel much more rested now that I make no effort to remember, much less control, my dreams.",1402196727
