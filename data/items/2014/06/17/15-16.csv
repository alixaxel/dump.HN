Its right in one of the best school districts and one of the top High Schools in the state.<p>A friend of mine recently visited from NYC and remarked about how he is paying $3000 for a place in Manhattan with one room. I couldnt imagine living in a building taking an elevator to my place. Cant have pets and he can barely have people over to sit down.<p>From the stories I hear about SF and NYC, I am probably never going to move to either.",1403020787

I hate sunny weather, I burn easily (even with sunscreen) and it&#x27;s easier for me to add clothing to guard against the cold than to shed layers to avoid the heat. I&#x27;m also allergic to the pollen of a whole host of plants that simply aren&#x27;t hardy enough to survive the winters here; my childhood summers were a miserable annual struggle through one respiratory infection after another, but nowadays I just pop a Zyrtec a few months out of the year and I&#x27;m good to go.<p>Pittsburgh is a great fit for me climate-wise, but given that I&#x27;d move to Alaska for the climate, I&#x27;m probably an outlier. ;)",1403020769

7905161,comment,7904824,7904824,29,0,df07,,,"The main difference we&#x27;ve seen is between retained vs. contingency recruiters. Contingency recruiters don&#x27;t get paid unless they find you a hire, which sounds great in theory but turns it into a lottery for them: spam as many developers and companies as you can, hoping for a big jackpot. It also leads to some of the scummier practices of hiding names and contact information (wouldn&#x27;t want to lose that commission!), and paying for referrals (after all, if I&#x27;m getting $20k for a hire, I can afford to pay out $2k to the person who did the work). They don&#x27;t really care if you fire the person after 6 months because they&#x27;ll be on to the next thing (or, even better, they can make another commission off of you!).<p>Retained recruiters, whether they&#x27;re contract or full-time, are ones you pay to represent your company. They work off a salary or an hourly rate, like normal employees. They expect to be there in a year or two, so if the hire doesn&#x27;t work out they&#x27;ll hear about it. They represent you as a company and don&#x27;t have any incentive to hide who they&#x27;re working for or who they&#x27;re talking to. You can still get clueless recruiters here, but at least the relationship is much better.",1403020750

Client-side password hashing to prevent passive MITMs to find raw passwords. These are not as secure as their <i>native</i> counterpart, and I don&#x27;t claim they are. Nor do I claim they are resilient to active MITM attacks in the JS delivery. But they are protected from having their data logged in plain by passive MITM eavesdroppers, and that means that they may be useful to people who are aware of the security they don&#x27;t have but appreciate the convenience of what they do have. <i>This is all I&#x27;m saying</i>.<p>Just like OpenSSH without server keys is vulnerable to MITM attacks, but still both useful and protected from eavesdropping. Just like people use plain Diffie-Hellman to negotiate a shared key, despite lack of authentication. Sometimes the active attack is simply not considered a problem, or the risk is simply accepted [2].<p>This is not a recommendation. This is a discussion about people having different requirements and uses. Almost all JS crypto used on the public internet does it wrong. But that doesn&#x27;t mean that JS crypto is 100% wrong in any conceivable case.

Yes, living expenses are proportionally higher here as well so I&#x27;m still only left with a small percentage of my paycheck. But that small percentage means a lot more because it can be spent on global goods like travel or savings.<p>Spending a couple grand on a vacation is basically a rounding error in a NYC budget, but it&#x27;d be a decent chunk of a Pittsburgh salary.

I&#x27;m originally from the Rust belt (2 hours from Pittsburgh and about 1.5 hours from Cleveland) and we thought long and hard about either of those two cities as a good place to move but Portland and the Ocean were just too big of a draw. Portland is much cheaper than other East Coast cities but has an amazing food screen, great outdoor activities on it&#x27;s doorstep, and a thriving art screen. It&#x27;s also only 90 minutes from Boston and a day trip drive from NYC. We also considered NYC and SF, to me there was no way to justify the expense vs Portland.

She found a job where she started in the mid 30’s. After two and a half years she’s broken 40 but not by much. She works about 60 hours a week. Her last review made her a manager so she gets no overtime. She works in an industry that caters to luxury so the company is setting income records. The money is all flowing to the top. It’s an employers market and the starting salary the company now offers is lower then it was when she started because there are so many college graduates looking for anything resembling a job.<p>She lived in Park Slope for the first two years, sharing a two bedroom, fifth floor walkup, attic apartment. The entire apartment was maybe 20 x 20 ft with a good part of it of limited use due to the slant of the roof. Rent was $1,500 a month including utilities. It was a great neighborhood though and she really enjoyed her time there.<p>The apartment building was sold to a luxury developer and the rent was raised to $2,300 a month. The new owners really just wanted the building empty so they could gut it and change it to luxury apartments. We walked by there this past weekend and the place was boarded up.<p>Her new apartment is a legitimate two bedroom in a clean but very old building on the edges of Boerum Hill. The neighborhood is okay but you need to be aware that two blocks away it starts get dodgy very quickly. The rent is $2,200 + utilities. Her and her apartment mate looked for two months to find the apartment. It was the only thing they could find that was affordable but wasn’t a filthy dump. The leases on the old and new places overlapped by a month and a half but they had to look early because the inventory is so limited.<p>Real estate in NYC has gone crazy. Manhattan prices are driven by international buyers looking for a place that’s safe. One bedroom apartments in Manhattan for less than a million are becoming scarce according to the NYT. Brooklyn is priced at what Manhattan was a couple of years ago. The downtown area of Brooklyn has been very popular because of the availability of mass transit to get people into their jobs in Manhattan. As you move out from downtown Brooklyn the commute time increases quickly as subway lines spread out and express trains make less frequent stops. Two to three hours a day on a subway commute becomes old very quickly.<p>NYC is a great place but unless you have some equity in the place you work you’re very likely not going to be able to afford to have the life you think is waiting for you there.",1403020344

FWIW Picketty seems to be <i>much</i> better at managing the internet battlefront, so it might be better to start with Sen&#x27;s book &quot;Poverty and Famines: An Essay on Entitlement and Deprivation&quot; ($10 on kindle) and then judge what you see on the internet after having read Sen&#x27;s argument.<p>Sen was originally motivated to study economics when, as a boy, he lived through one of India&#x27;s famines while working at a grain/rice/? silo. He wanted to reconcile the fact that there was a large amount of excess grain left at the time the next crop was being harvested with the fact that he had seen starved corpses along the streets (and had heard that the famine was much worse elsewhere through the newspaper). He eventually came to the conclusion that the famine he had lived through, along with many others, was primarily economic (due to inequality combined with a few other triggers) rather than due to local food supply actually falling below what was needed to feed the population.<p>I don&#x27;t know as much about Picketty (I had Sen as a lecturer -- didn&#x27;t care much for him in that capacity, but his writing was top quality). I <i>do</i> know that I haven&#x27;t been impressed or convinced by Picketty&#x27;s arguments, which read as if they were written by someone who had never read Sen&#x27;s book (he keeps raising objections that Sen thoroughly addressed >30 years ago).",1403020279

Except now, he&#x27;s in bed with the Krishna&#x27;s, instead of finding a personal and secular path to meditation. The girl in the Christian cult discovered the power of community and forgiveness. Funny how white centric these articles are. If a kid becomes a Krishna its suddenly a bewildering thing, but if a kid joins a gang on the south side of Chicago, we just shrug. Both these things have a lot in common; society, family, etc not providing what they should and not projecting those values to kids.<p>I think religiosity and cults rise when secular society fails at something.  We&#x27;re not telling kids that meditation can help them. We&#x27;ve not telling them that maintaining personal relationships is actually hard work and forgiveness even harder.  Perhaps nowadays we are. I see a lot of what religion offers distilled into non-faith based practices. You can meditate without knowing the first thing about the buddha.  You can engage in a personal spirituality without feeling guilted to show up for social functions (that only seem to empower the leaders of congregations).  You can explore consciousness with drugs, lucid dreaming, or just via one&#x27;s informed imagination, etc.<p>Empowering individuals to discover information on a personal basis is what the information age is all about.

There&#x27;s a lot wrong with it, but a lot of right too. It is certainly very cheap to live, and there&#x27;s a lot going on. We even have a Techstars-affiliated incubator, which used to offer a really, really good deal. My first startup, CloudFab, went through it years ago. That said, SF is still the best place in the world to do a startup: every city says &quot;We may not be SF, but we have X!&quot; X is _never_ enough to make up for not being SF. I said it when I lived there too, and now that I&#x27;ve lived in SF, I know that&#x27;s just deeply, deeply wrong. That doesn&#x27;t mean you _can&#x27;t_ do it, but it&#x27;s a handicap.<p>However, living in a place is very rarely about &#x27;economic sense.&#x27; I have a _need_ to live in NYC. I&#x27;ve gotten more work done in the two weeks I&#x27;ve lived here than I did in the entire six months I lived in SF, and maybe about a third of what I did in LA. The hustle, bustle, and opportunities are endless.<p>Last night I woke up at ten am, did my laundry, then went to a juice bar, worked for a few hours, walked around, ended up literally coding on a bar while watching the US. vs. Ghana game, then took the train over to Herald Square and coded in the park. It was a beautiful evening. Around midnight, walked up to Times Square to squeak in some power before all the stores closed, then worked in another park until 3am, and took the train home. You can&#x27;t really do that anywhere else, at least in the states.<p>Oh, and I&#x27;m saving about 25% on my rent by moving to Brooklyn from San Francisco, and I&#x27;d be saving 60% if I had still lived in the Mission when I left.",1403019818

7905007,comment,7900533,7902837,3,0,_delirium,,,"I agree that this sentiment is a major issue for public support of welfare systems. A few (admittedly speculative) thoughts on what&#x27;s different in Denmark, where such sentiment isn&#x27;t <i>absent</i>, but I think is a bit weaker and less influential:<p>1. In a way, the U.S. makes for a foil that enhances the perception that the welfare state is necessary for a society we&#x27;d like to live in. People are afraid of Copenhagen ending up like San Francisco or Detroit, with homeless people everywhere, dangerous ghettos, etc., and there&#x27;s a perception that the welfare system is one thing keeping that possibility at bay, and keeping Copenhagen a fairly safe and nice place to live. The &quot;are you trying to turn us into America?&quot; trump-card is a huge PR/positioning problem for the (smallish) free-market/libertarian parties, because a lot of people are genuinely afraid of it.<p>2. A decent amount of stuff that is &quot;welfare&quot; in the U.S. is instead just something <i>everyone</i> gets, so there is no issue over eligibility and whether people are gaming it. Everyone gets free healthcare, subsidized childcare, free university, paid paternity/maternity leave, etc., so there aren&#x27;t debates over things like Medicaid or CHIP. Even the public-housing system is open to anyone (there are waitlists for popular buildings, but no income/wealth cutoff).<p>3. There&#x27;s a general feeling that even people who really are up to no good are still somehow &quot;our responsibility&quot;. It&#x27;s kind of the society-level version of what southern Europeans feel on the extended-family level. To a Greek, your uncle might be a lazy jerk and/or an alcoholic, but he&#x27;s still your uncle and it&#x27;s seen as at least partly the family&#x27;s responsibility to make sure he&#x27;s not homeless or resorting to crime to eat: it&#x27;d be shameful to the family if one of theirs was not taken care of. In Denmark it&#x27;s sort of the same, except it&#x27;s not the individual family&#x27;s responsibility, but the state&#x27;s, to make sure everyone in the &quot;extended family&quot; is off the streets and able to eat.<p>4. Low-end jobs just pay a lot more. Even working as a supermarket check-out clerk, barista, or McDonald&#x27;s employee, pays ~$35k-$40k if you do it full-time. So being employed makes a qualitative class difference: in the U.S., minimum-wage workers and welfare recipients are both &quot;lower-class&quot; or &quot;poor&quot;, whereas in Denmark, welfare recipients are mostly &quot;poor&quot; while minimum-wage workers are &quot;middle class&quot;. As a result, people tend not to feel envious of those on welfare, but more pity towards them.<p>5. There&#x27;s a greater cultural acceptance of the idea that people can be temporarily disabled. You can be on disability or sick leave for 6 months for a physical or mental health problem, and then go back to work; it&#x27;s not only for people who are permanently disabled. This is seen as relatively normal, and such sick leaves are relatively common. Since many people have either taken one themselves, or have friends/family who have, it&#x27;s not seen as much as something that &quot;other&quot; people are doing to take your tax money, but something that many people, including your own social circle, might need.<p>In general, the fact that <i>many</i> people will use the welfare system at some point in their life, even if only briefly, means people are very interested in ensuring that it&#x27;s quick and efficient. Whereas my impression is that most Americans don&#x27;t have a personal interest in the welfare system being quick and friendly, because they don&#x27;t expect to use it.",1403019456

Your site is delivered through TLS, using one of the non-DHE ciphersuites.

By subjecting the app to extreme conditions of rapid rotation, subtle flaws in the compensation process are made apparent - specifically, that the iPhone&#x27;s gravity sensor gets confused & skewed, that the progressive scanning of each frame means distorting the image (the top of the image shows a view 1/60th or so of a second different from the bottom), and the two together result in a bizarre/unexpected periodic warping of the image.

7904815,comment,7904346,7904751,2,0,danudey,,,"> I really think this is a bad idea. If you&#x27;re a business and depend on a certain type of traffic (say Skype, or maybe email) why wouldn&#x27;t you consider the option of trying to ensure faster and more reliable delivery of some type of data that is absolutely critical?<p>Because these &#x27;fast lanes&#x27; won&#x27;t be faster lanes; they&#x27;ll be the performance we have normally, and other traffic will be degraded.<p>The solution to the issue that you propose already exists, and it&#x27;s called Quality of Service; by having your router aware of your upstream/downstream bandwidth and setting simple rules you can prioritize traffic already. You don&#x27;t need your ISP to charge you extra to do this.<p>ISPs providing &#x27;fast lanes&#x27; would be fine if American broadband issues weren&#x27;t because of companies with multi-billion-dollar profits not bothering to upgrade their infrastructure to support their customers, or if they hadn&#x27;t been paid billions by the government to provide universal broadband and then simply not bothered to do so.<p>History has shown that American ISPs operate as monopolies[1], crush any attempt at competition[2], promise improvements and never deliver[3], and generally take advantage of their customers whenever possible, all the while complaining that the problem keeping them from providing good service is the few regulations under which they operate.<p>Now they&#x27;re claiming that their networks can&#x27;t handle a large proportion of their users using their connections at once, and it&#x27;s all Netflix&#x27;s fault (and not theirs for oversubscribing).<p>So yeah, I think this is a good idea. Force ISPs to deliver the service that people are supposedly paying for, and not pay extra for it.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/01/these-charts-show-comcast-acting-more-and-more-like-a-monopolist/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/01...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/01/who-wants-competition-big-cable-tries-outlawing-municipal-broadband-in-kansas/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/01/who-wants-competi...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/06/att-makes-the-same-promises-every-time-it-buys-a-new-company/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/business/2014/06/att-makes-the-same-p...</a>",1403017441

7904808,comment,7904522,7904605,3,0,justincormack,,,"Generally as a developer you just want to bind to &quot;::&quot; when listening as the equivalent of &quot;0.0.0.0&quot; ie all addresses, or &quot;::1&quot; for localhost (and create an ipv6 socket, but most higher level stacks will do that given an ipv6 adddress). In most stacks that is the only userspace change. The usual setup is that this will also map ipv4 connections over to ipv6. That is not always true, eg OpenBSD will never bind to both kinds of address, you have to listen on two sockets, and you can force that behaviour on other systems. This should work so long as the host you are on does not have ipv6 completely disabled in the kernel, even if there is in fact no ipv6 routing.<p>Most things &quot;just work&quot;, though there are minor fixes and things to know, eg the standard notation for ipv6 literals in http is <a href=""http://"" rel=""nofollow"">http://</a>[::1]/ as the : might be a port specifier.
