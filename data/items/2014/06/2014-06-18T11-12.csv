At the moment, by far the largest number are saying that they don&#x27;t give money, but that they buy food or other goods instead. If that were true, I would expect to have seen someone give a homeless person food at least once in my life, or offer to take them somewhere they could buy food, or just stop to talk to them. As it is, I&#x27;ve seen zero people give food, maybe a few hundred people give money, and hundreds of thousands do nothing.",1403092770

7909563,comment,7909421,7909421,2,0,chipsy,,,"I established a formal policy of not doing business with strangers in public areas - and panhandling is definitely a business. It just happens to be one that works by creating and subsequently monetizing guilt. An adept panhandler will combine the skills of a con artist, a mugger and a thief, so that you are first frightened and thrown off balance by their aggression, then guilted by their pitch, and finally robbed by their sleight of hand.<p>When panhandlers or other street people behave more aggressively I simply run away like a scared animal. They do not have a moral right to touch or yell at me, but neither do I have the right to use violence against them for that.<p>The good you need to do to solve &quot;the problem&quot; of homelessness and poverty involves gradual systemic change - handing out cash to one person at one time is going to maintain the status quo. You have no way to know whose story is a truthful one when you are so suddenly confronted by it - it is like making a blind investment. Only invest if you force them to commit time to you. If they refuse they are up to no good and you should run away.",1403092729

7909472,comment,7909201,7909201,9,0,mickeyp,,,"Good, basic practices to follow. Here&#x27;s a few more:<p>- If you&#x27;re using AMQP/RabbitMQ as your result back end it will create a lot of dead queues to store results in. This can easily overwhelm your RabbitMQ server if you don&#x27;t clear these out frequently. Newer releases of Celery will do this daily I think - but it&#x27;s worth keeping in mind if your RMQ instance falls over in prod.<p>- Use chaining to build up &quot;sequential&quot; tasks that need doing instead of calling one after another in the same task (or worse, doing a big mouthful of work) in one task as Celery can prioritise many tasks better than synchronously calling several tasks in a row from one &quot;master&quot; task.<p>- Try to keep a consistent module import pattern for celery tasks, or explicitly name them, as Celery does a lot of magic in the background so task spawning is seamless to the developer. This is very important as you should never mix relative and absolute importing when you are dealing with tasks. from foo import mytask may be picked up differently than &quot;import foo&quot; followed by &quot;foo.mytask&quot; would resulting in some tasks not being picked up by Celery(!)<p>- Never pass database objects, as OP says, is true; but go one step further and don&#x27;t pass complex objects at all if you can avoid it. I vaguely remember some of the urllib/httplib exceptions in Python not being serializable and causing very cryptic errors if you didn&#x27;t capture the exception and sanitise it or re-raise your own.<p>- Use proper configuration management to set up and configure Celery plus what ever messaging broker/backend. There&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than spending your time trying to replicate somebody&#x27;s half-assed Celery/Rabbit configuration that they didn&#x27;t nail down and test properly in a clean-room environment.",1403091677

It can do a lot for your career to work there, but it&#x27;s not a place where you can safely overperform.<p><i>However, there is a way to provide private feedback that can only be seen by your manager; in my experience this backchannel is rarely used.</i><p>&quot;Yes, I realize that a murder count of 2,500 in a city of 1 million is horrifying. But look on the bright side. That means there were 997,500 people who were <i>not</i> murdered last year.&quot;<p><i>Managers take all of your reviews as input and determine a performance rating, which is a score in one of five buckets to indicate how well you&#x27;re doing overall.</i><p>As of 2011, you actually get a score between 1.0 and 5.0. Almost everyone is between 3.0 and 4.0. The buckets are very large. &quot;Meets Expectations&quot; is everything from a 3.0 (acceptable for new hires, but damning if you&#x27;ve been there for a while) to 3.4 (slightly above average). If you&#x27;re in this bucket, you don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;ve been marked as a loser (and rendered unable to transfer) or are getting 65th-percentile ratings. You can literally waste 18 months on a loser project only to find you can&#x27;t transfer because your boss gave you 3.0&#x27;s.<p><i>These scores are also calibrated against other managers across the organization, to prevent managers from biasing their scores -- an individual manager can&#x27;t game the system.</i><p>That&#x27;s a nice way to present stack ranking. Each boss gets a finite number of calibration points and has to pick who does well and who doesn&#x27;t. If he gets a crappy allotment and desperately needs to use all his points to promote the guy who&#x27;ll do a startup unless bumped, you could get stuck with a (career-ending) 2.9.<p>----<p>The important thing to remember about Google&#x27;s promotion process is that it&#x27;s bicameral. Manager-assigned calibration scores are one component. Peer reviews are another. You need <i>both</i> to advance at Google. Google provides multiple paths to failure, not multiple paths to success. If your manager likes you and gives you 4.0+, you can still get dinged for lack of visibility. On the other hand, if your manager is giving you shit for calibration scores, all the peer review in the world won&#x27;t get you out of the muck. I&#x27;ve known many Googlers to damage their careers by playing their manager but not the crowd, or vice versa. You need to play both games at the same time.<p>For a better analysis of Google&#x27;s promotion/review system, read Piaw Na&#x27;s essays, such as this one: <a href=""http://piaw.blogspot.com/2010/04/promotion-systems.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://piaw.blogspot.com/2010/04/promotion-systems.html</a><p>This is also worth reading: <a href=""http://valleywag.gawker.com/eric-schmidt-personally-ruined-google-employees-review-1587309422"" rel=""nofollow"">http://valleywag.gawker.com/eric-schmidt-personally-ruined-g...</a>",1403090981
