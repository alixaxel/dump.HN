7868204,comment,7867634,7868176,2,0,pron,,,"Again, I was referring to that type of FP the author was talking about, i.e. the one practiced in Haskell/scalaz. Everything you mention is useful. But just to play devil&#x27;s advocate for a second, the mere fact that something is useful does not always mean that it&#x27;s worth its price. So whenever you give me a &quot;solution&quot; you first have to demonstrate the magnitude of the problem and the price I have to pay elsewhere. Simple map and reduce operations certainly have a non-negligible utility (more readable code, better reuse), and they do come at a low cost. But elaborate type systems and restriction of side effects cost a hefty price, so they need to justify their use a lot more than just show that they&#x27;re useful.",1402318672

7868177,comment,7867634,7868032,2,0,Xurinos,,,"1. I think we should challenge the definition of &quot;global variable&quot;.  In what context is the variable global?  The traditional definition is that the context is the whole program.  However, in imperative OOP [1] code, I find that people just learned to hide their global variables in class instances.  The whole program cannot access them, right? but every method in the class can and does, and all those mutations and side effects can lead to the kind of spaghetti code we all hated when there was no OOP.  It&#x27;s just global variables with extra sugar.  And we can make copies of them, so the code is maybe one step better.<p>Imperative OOP often feels like one is pivoting behavior around the data.<p>FP feels like the data is flowing from one transformation to the next.<p>There is the &quot;functional&quot; part of it, too... where functions are highly composable.  One creates new functions by combining old functions, and these may carry along with them important context (closures).<p>2. From what I&#x27;ve learned of Haskell -- and I&#x27;m a Haskell noob -- it lets you work with the side effecty real world.  You can alter your hardware state.  The key is that it specifically flags such side effects and encourages separation between more &quot;pure&quot; code and code that is &quot;tainted&quot; with the side effects.<p>[1] OOP is an abstraction and compatible with pure FP.  You can model your class instances such that they are immutable and get all the benefits of OOP.  FP contrasts better with imperative programming.",1402318233

The worst teachers (we have all had them) are those who jump straight into the abstraction that solves the problem instead of going through some examples first.

Votes count equally for all citizens. So every citizen has the opportunity to operate a node for the time (48hours) that the elections will take place, in order to inhibit possible corruption. Given the No of organizations, individuals (e.g. political activists, freedom believes, anarchists, you-name-it, conservatives, liberals, you-name-it) and geeks (who will do it for fun, get an RPi, setup a node for the elections, measure traffic, do a JS/CSS3 front-end to display traffic, real-time results etc.)<p>The government (formed by all parties) should be able to setup an X number of nodes that would allow the elections to take place anyway, without relying to third parties.

Should an account be linked with their IDs?\n    * Should we use a dedicated machine with touch screen and accessibility options in a private chamber?\n    * Should we use electronic signatures generated by a special &#x27;card&#x27; which every citizen should have one?\n    * etc\n\n</code></pre>\nEstonia has an electronic card[2] for example that could turn handy into situations like these.<p>There many ways of deployment with pros/cons to be considered on a country by country scenario.<p>Bitcoin protocol solves the double voting, the possibility to re-count votes, the possibility (which is nowhere today) for citizens to review their votes even years later.<p>Also we should not underestimate the ability to vote from the comfort of your home, using any device:  Imagine how greatly that would improve the % of people participating in the elections for example.<p>[1] I can&#x27;t think of what the NSA could come with in this scenario.

Before answering your questions, here&#x27;s a preliminary point:<p>0) The problem is that FP is not really defined anywhere, or rather, everyone has its own definition. I was wondering about the definition of FP about a month ago, and discussed it with my roommate who&#x27;s a phd student in programming languages. The conclusion of this 2-hour long conversation was: well FP is kind of a fuzzy concept. The concepts of FP languages, typed languages, static languages, etc.. all tend to conflate. Some people will consider that Scheme, Python, Ruby, Scala, Haskell, OCaml, R are all FP languages. Some will say that only Haskell and OCaml really are. Whatever..<p>Keeping that in mind, here some attempts at answers:<p>1) In a very loose sense, I guess that you can say that, and to make it possible, you need some constructs in your language, the minimum requirements being higher order functions, and maybe closures. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s the minimum, but again I&#x27;m no specialist. But then if you want to push this &quot;no globals&quot; moto to its logical extreme, you get to a point where you can&#x27;t even use a &quot;print&quot; function, since it has some side effects. Haskell does, and solves the problem with monads. But to have monads you need a very particular type system, which leads to the question of wether you need a type system to go FP all the way? I don&#x27;t know. Someone more knowledgeable should answer that<p>2) I don&#x27;t know about hardware. But like I said, FP can deal with state. In fact, even hardcore FP as embodied by Haskell can deal with state. It&#x27;s not trivial to wrap your head around the concept, but it&#x27;s worth giving it a shot.",1402316854
