7952685,comment,7950102,7951031,2,0,ufo,,,"My personal opinions on templates, for Javascript and other languages are:<p>* Use something that is HTML-aware instead of something that treats HTML as text. Even if you have the template engine still spit out HTML strings in the end its going to be able to escape user data in a context-aware manner and get rid of useless whitespace.<p>* Logic in templates is fine and separation of concerns between view and model does not have to mean using different languages for them. My impression is that most &quot;logic-less&quot; templates eventually reinvent broken versions of variables, loops, conditionals and subroutines so I would rather use a real language from the start. An example I like is giving different classes to odd and even rows in a table. The solution is obvious if you use regular loops but can be quite tricky in many template engines.",1403841461

7952666,comment,7950637,7950637,2,0,jqm,,,"This was a good article.<p>But, I might point out, relationships are one thing, marriage is another. The article started with one topic and then wandered off into the other. I highly doubt people stayed together 70 years ago because they paid more attention to each other. I think it was just socially and economically harder to divorce.<p>In addition, the recommendations are good, however it takes two people to follow them. Having had a number of short term and long term girlfriends (the current one for over 8 years, she may be the last, who knows....), I have found there is such a thing as an attention vampire. People who have no respect for your space or focus. People who think your entire existence is to pay attention to them. And, I have found that there is no satisfying these people and they will move right on to someone else as you inevitabley become exhausted. So, I would speculate, in addition to the excellent points in the article, that successful couples have reasonable, respectful, and most importantly, compatible attention requirements.<p>Also, paradoxically, I found that paying too much attention to __some__ people causes them to place less value on your attention. When they no longer value your attention, they lose respect, and this causes a downhill slide in the relationship as well. The article is, I believe, written from a female point of view (can I say that? does it make me a bad sexist person?). It is a valuable and beautiful point of view. But like most things in life, balance and measure comes into play, and failing to recognize this leads to disaster as surely as ignoring your partners needs does.<p>Just my thoughts. I didn&#x27;t do a study.",1403840936

Connecting this to the speed controller is only the logical next step. I&#x27;m actually surprised that it took Hyundai so long to connect the dots.<p>I don&#x27;t know about the US and UK, but whenever the Korean police installs a speed camera, they put up a clear warning sign 500-1000m before the camera. There is absolutely no secret or surprise about the location of a speed trap, and the police apparently doesn&#x27;t care to catch drivers by surprise, either. Someone probably figured out that drivers tend to slow down when they see the warning sign, and do so gradually instead of suddenly since the actual camera is still a quarter mile away.

Knowing that the rules will change every year your goal isn&#x27;t to grind out this year&#x27;s changes really hard for six months (and then even harder for another moth to change the final changes) and then slack off for five months.<p>Instead you should implement a system such that the specifics of the changes are captured in the rules.  Once the new drafts come out you need to look for what all the possible new rule categories are, what additional data needs to be captured, etc.  But then once things are finalized it&#x27;s a matter of tweaking the rules slightly to capture the final wording of the bill.<p>This may not be something that applies to you, though.

7952641,comment,7951082,7952400,1,0,msandford,,,"That&#x27;s an interesting point.  Here&#x27;s my take:<p>If you ask someone who knows about the business rules if something could EVER happen and they say &quot;no&quot; they&#x27;re probably wrong, but not maliciously so.  Be cautious when taking their word for something.  Even if the CEO signs off on the idea of &quot;such and such never needs to be able to do x, y or z&quot; the second a big contract does need it, it all goes out the window.<p>As a result whenever possible choose solutions that give you SOME flexibility without necessarily creating a supremely robust, exhaustive module.<p>In this particular case, once you realize that you&#x27;re going to have more in the way of permissions other than global can/can&#x27;t do, it&#x27;s time to be smart.  Being smart might only mean creating a function which takes some context like userid and &quot;permissions token&quot; and/or the URL that the person is visiting and then doing a hardcoded permissions check for say one of a dozen userids who are basically root versus everyone else who isn&#x27;t.<p>Yes you didn&#x27;t make a giant scalable system of awesomeness including a web-based permission editor.  But you did make a function you can insert every time a new permission item gets created and eventually a system could be created for storing those in the database such that users can eventually be mapped to permissions also in the database.<p>So if you want to hard-code those values into a single page, which then grows into two pages, which then grows into four pages which then grows into 29 pages that&#x27;s the wrong solution.  But if you want to hardcode those into a function which you then call, that&#x27;s a good enough solution for now that doesn&#x27;t hobble you later.  Putting the function call in adds very minimal overhead in terms of execution and ranges from slightly negative to moderately positive on maintainability.<p>Parts of software development are similar to being a speculator in a financial market.  You need to have a fairly intuitive grasp of what&#x27;s going to be a &quot;good bet&quot; for spending a little more time now which has the potential to pay off big in the future.",1403840229

Obviously it was a prototype but the pieces were all there.<p>Our business pitch was to focus on developers for easy integration. Out of sixty participants, we won best pitch judged by our peers, but didn&#x27;t even place top 3 with the judges (VC&#x27;s plus CEOs), who could not see how this was a &quot;defensible&quot; idea. Their issue was that these knowledge based questions (called &quot;wallet questions&quot; -- multiple choice, like &quot;what street did you live on in 2005?) were from public data sources, and therefore, not &quot;defensible.&quot; In the judges minds, any large company like Transunion could replicate this business fairly trivially.<p>I argued then, and I&#x27;ll argue now, that there&#x27;s a lot to be said for first mover advantage, developer friendliness, and a small, agile engineering team to back it up. Sure, all those data sources are public. But the existing API&#x27;s for accessing them really suck. Transunion and other incumbent competitors have shown no indication that they&#x27;re capable of improving upon those API&#x27;s. Even if they did, it would only be out of reaction to a company like this, and at that point the battle for developers is already lost.<p>Best of luck to this team. With the YC name and a developer friendly approach, I maintain that this product has a very good shot at profitability. Its customers are developers, and you can charge a nominal fee per check, because those developers are likely building a product that profits per customer. So these guys can go after tens, or hundreds, of developers, but reach potentially hundreds of thousands of customers. It&#x27;s a great business model.<p>This story also goes to show that ideas are a some a dozen. It&#x27;s the execution, team, and positioning that will determine success. Good luck!",1403839743

I&#x27;d guess 2 months based on how quickly I switched from &quot;intranet projects&quot; to integrating Amazon MWS, 3rd parties, etc.<p>> 3) I would suppose the lack of rules makes them fast in the beginning and in the end they are contributing to the mess in their own special way, doubling down on the technical debt.<p>More or less, yes. An example would be we now have 3 partial versions of the same intranet application. The super old one, the one I built before handing it off to the new guy, and the new guy&#x27;s version [because he didn&#x27;t like my version].",1403838054

Presumably the keyboard also provides notification that caps lock is no, so the login system is not providing any additional information not already available to an attacker.",1403838038
