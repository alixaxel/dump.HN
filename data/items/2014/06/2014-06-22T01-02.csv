7926637,comment,7926397,7926490,2,0,bane,,,"One of the interesting policy problems of forcing vaccines is that you have to ensure that people who can&#x27;t get vaccines for medical conditions are able to get around in society, and that people with absurd anti-vaccine conspiracy beliefs don&#x27;t get medical waivers.<p>My father, for example, can&#x27;t get flu vaccines. The last time he got one was decades ago and he ended up hospitalized, completely paralyzed with minimal respiratory and heart functions, able only to move his eyes. He recovered, but it took weeks. They think he has Guillain-Barré syndrome and it kills many people who suffer from it (though they likely don&#x27;t know until they suffer from it, the flu vaccine is one of the known triggers). The risk of immediate death is so high that he avoids most vaccines altogether.",1403402265

7926590,comment,7922183,7924555,2,0,Im_Talking,,,"Sure. A business should always be prepared for outside interest meaning that you should have up-to-date financials that you can give-out anytime which show the summary information and overall financial trend, have no unusual liabilities like a unpaid tax liability, systems in-place to automate business functions (so a potential acquirer can see an efficient organisation), all employees/customers on some kind-of contract, no IP issues (all B2B relationships under contract).<p>So any business with interest can spend a minimal time in due-diligence and see an efficient, professional organisation with no skeletons.<p>At the same time, the goal of business is to exit, either via a buyout, or IPO, or whatever. No one wants to own a business that is unattractive for acquisition or investment, since these businesses just fade-away over time.<p>So the directors need to continually look for potential strategic relationships; a) because these are obviously potential customers, and b) because they are potential acquirers who will pay top-dollar for your business. This means that they will forget any standard valuation formulas (&#x27;X&#x27; x sales, &#x27;Y&#x27; x EBITDA, whatever) and look at their overall strategic need for what your business will bring to them. And, most importantly, you need to communicate with them on this strategic level... so you need to do your research and keep your ears open to understand their pain points, and strategic needs.<p>By keeping your house in order, looking at the strategic level, and trying to elicit the interest of those businesses who &#x27;need&#x27; you, you may get yourself in the perfect situations where you have competing bids, or the interested parties start to think (with your gentle prodding, of course) of the pain if you were bought-out by their competitor, etc. These are the ideal situations.

When a company invests in its employees&#x27; networks, it not only expands its ability to recruit more people directly, it also expands its employees&#x27; ability to find new jobs.<p>This may still be a net win for everyone, but it&#x27;s complicated.  Imagine you run a company and have identified a few bad employees.  Surely you should not reward them by sending them to conferences, right?  But wait, maybe you should, because then not only might they spend time learning, recruiting, and doing other things that might be more productive for your company than whatever they&#x27;re currently screwing up, but they might also find a new job which is both better for them and solves your problem of how to get rid of bad employees without undue liability.<p>So send your best, most loyal, most enthusiastic employees out into the world to meet other people and spread the word about your company.

The world is eventually consistent. Some business domains can handle that. Even some banking operations are eventually consistent. You can get to an ATM in Australia and one in US at the same time and overdraw your account. That is eventually consistency. Banks see it better that way then expect you to wait for half an hour until they can decide on a global shared consistent state of your account.<p>> Essentially, that engineer needs to manually do the hard work to ensure that multiple clients don’t step on each other’s toes and deal with stale data.<p>Sometimes that is not that hard. Sometimes business logic allows for a custom (user-based) reconciliation of conflicts. In some cases that engineer has to rely on magic unicorns that another engineer (who build the DB) put it in the product to make it beat the CAP theorem. Or the administrator needs to handle global restart of all the servers because the global cluster has become unavailable because say one node has blown up or got partitioned.
