7851222,comment,7847350,7851210,2,0,acqq,,,"Well I have the news for you (re &quot;I see division by 0 and floating point exceptions as advantageous&quot;): when you use floating point in any current language now the division with 0 would not trigger any &quot;exception&quot; and it&#x27;s certainly not supported by any language directly. CPU traps for the FPU are disabled by default by the language std libs.<p>Even worse, Java&#x27;s model doesn&#x27;t allow anybody to reach to the hardware.<p>The author of IEEE 754, prof. Kahan lamented exactly that: that the languages of today effectively can&#x27;t use a lot of the features he designed (in 2004, <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/JAVAhurt.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/JAVAhurt.pdf</a> Page 20: &quot;Java lacks these <i>flags</i> and cannot conform to IEEE 754 without them.&quot;).<p>That was the FP domain, but is instructive. The traps are relatively &quot;all or nothing&quot; thing. To have a language where some <i>integer</i> variables behave one way and some another way (you know, the types are important now), you already have the hardware flags and they simply aren&#x27;t used in the languages OP mentions.<p>Just changing the compiler behavior would be absolutely enough to &quot;turn up a whole pile of bugs in systems that we currently consider to be solid&quot; that you suggest. You certainly don&#x27;t need to wait for some new CPUs.<p>So we return to what Anon said: &quot;Those who do not understand the hardware are doomed to blog about it, poorly.&quot; If somebody wants to have the language types that trigger exceptions on overflows, he doesn&#x27;t have to wait for the new processors. It&#x27;s possible now, if there&#x27;s interest in it. And even as the real &quot;traps&quot; as the very specific CPU feature for FP already exist, no language I know of uses them for types.",1401965404

The only people who care about this style of benchmark are people with very specialised use cases and academics (and their students), the latter of which are trying to prove something that is easy to prove, but doesn&#x27;t really tell us anything of practical use.<p>For most purposes, a user of your software is not going to feel the difference between 0.0006 seconds and 0.06 seconds. One is 100x faster, so is &quot;better&quot;, but no user will care.<p>The stuff that is really expensive (3D graphics, etc.) that users care about are being handed off into custom APIs that are highly optimised and hardware acceleration anyway.<p>What&#x27;s more important for most programmers when choosing a language is not &quot;how fast is it for this code to run?&quot;, but &quot;how quickly can I ship code?&quot;<p>Code in the app store next quarter is going to beat code you never get shipped, every single time.<p>Not long ago I had a project I thought would be perfect for Haskell.

It&#x27;s probably slower, it&#x27;s perhaps not as elegant as a Haskell solution. But it&#x27;s shipped. And that therefore beats the Haskell solution which does not exist.<p>Swift appears to have modern features that mean many programmers will feel more comfortable developing applications using it, many of whom would have struggled with Obj-C.<p>In that sense, it&#x27;s going to beat Objective C for performance in the only benchmark that matters commercially: the one that gets ideas into user&#x27;s hands the quickest.<p>If you think the rate of development so far has been fast, well, just watch. It&#x27;s about to get mental.<p>I don&#x27;t expect an academic to understand that, nor would I expect most junior/undergrad devs, and I can see in some special cases you would want to think about optimisation (in which case turn that little piece of code into C and link it in), but in the real World, that&#x27;s how coding works.",1401964981

7851129,comment,7847350,7850957,2,0,acqq,,,"No, I don&#x27;t agree that &quot;the author is most likely aware of the overflow flag&quot; since the author says:<p>&quot;Processors should support integer math instructions that optionally trap on overflow. Because popular architectures lack this feature, otherwise excellent modern systems programming languages, such as Rust, Go, and D, have default integer types that wrap.&quot;<p>In short, he believes there&#x27;s no hardware support and therefore Rust, GO and D don&#x27;t have it.<p>There <i>is</i> however hardware support in every imaginable CPU -- overflow is important to be able to synthesize adds bigger than the native size (e.g. 128 bit add if your regs are 64-bits) . Except for the implementor of the HLL compiler you as the user wouldn&#x27;t be able to see how it&#x27;s implemented in the hardware unless you look at the resulting generated code (you&#x27;d see an &quot;exception&quot; triggered no matter how it&#x27;s implemented).<p>I know: I had the opportunity to implement the language which has special behavior when the floating point compare involves NaN. Luckily, there is a flag in the Intel CPU for that too and as far as I know you can&#x27;t access it from any popular high level language, but my code generator injects additional flag check in every FP compare and in the production code I haven&#x27;t seen any negative performance impacts compared to the case where I don&#x27;t do the stated injection. That&#x27;s how good the current branch prediction in CPUs can be.<p>So no, you don&#x27;t need &quot;hardware traps&quot; you need somebody to first try to implement the given behavior in any HLL language before before we argue further. As soon as you have &quot;wrappable&quot; and &quot;unwrappable&quot; types in the language, you can have all the crypto primitives that need wrapping use the &quot;wrappables&quot; without any performance impact.<p>In fact &quot;unwrappables&quot; were interesting mostly for the calculations of the limits, practically wherever you&#x27;d use, for example, Microsoft&#x27;s SafeInt classes.<p>The example from their header:<p><pre><code>       void* AllocateMemForStructs(int StructSize, int HowMany) {\n          SafeInt<unsigned long> s(StructSize);\n          s *= HowMany;\n          return malloc(s);\n       }\n</code></pre>\nAt least using MSFT&#x27;s Visual C++ you can already have exceptions on integer overflows.",1401963136

Political leaders saw the price paid for being colonial dependencies of the British crown and it was too high. After years of negotiations the constitutional links between Australia and Britain were finally broken , not by a referendum but by legislation passed by the state, commonwealth and British parliaments. On March 3, 1986, these acts, the Australia Acts, came into force. They state that the British government is no longer responsible for the government of any state and that the Westminster parliament can no longer legislate for Australia. Most important, they transferred into Australian hands full control of all Australia&#x27;s constitutional documents. So March 3, 1986, is the day Australia achieved complete independence from Britain. Happy Australian Independence Day.&quot;<p>The Queen of England is also still nominally head of state of Canada.
