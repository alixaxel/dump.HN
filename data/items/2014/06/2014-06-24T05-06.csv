Dutch Boers, later called Afrikaners tended to aspire to be farmers, rather than merchants. In the last 65 years or so, Afrikaners did move into the big business world, but that was a nationalistic reaction to the economic dominance of English-speaking whites.<p>If I had to hazard a guess, I&#x27;d say that the rise of the CA as CEO has to do with the complex conglomerates that were created during the apartheid era. Companies had limited expansion opportunities, so they&#x27;d use their capital in unrelated businesses. South African Breweries, for example owned a large supermarket chain. The focus on the bottom line in these complex conglomerates rather than a  specific business was presumably a great fit for bean counters. And even though the era of great unfocused conglomerates has ended as expansion opportunities opened up when apartheid ended, CAs were deeply entrenched in the corporate world, and the phenomenon of CAs on top has continued.",1403589381

7936348,comment,7933986,7936256,1,0,Lamlon,,,"1. I don&#x27;t think your primary point was that valid in that people are going to have to deploy during the middle of the day sometimes, and mistakes happen sometimes. We all have deployed an app with a bug in it at one point or another.<p>For heroku it is tougher, they are the app that runs other apps, so bugs have a much larger impact. I would hope they have post mortem&#x27;s and take actions to ensure this doesn&#x27;t happen again. IE why wasn&#x27;t this caught in a staging environment?<p>I agree that heroku totally fucked up, I would feel terrible if I was the engineer that fucked this up (as they should). However I think you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater.<p>I have seen outages last 1 hour + at big startups in the valley, it happens. I am not saying that it is right, I am saying that it is very difficult to do right, and very few companies are able to do it. It generally takes quite a few people to do it and far too often I have seen it come at the cost of being able to move quickly. Not excusing heroku for making these mistakes, I think it blows pretty hard. I just think there is no good alternative.<p>I believe that you are seriously underestimating the amount of effort required to deliver 99.9% reliability. I also believe you are underestimating how much heroku does for you on a git push if you think it is a bash script that has already been written. If that were true we would all have Heroku behind the firewall.<p>5. Heroku&#x27;s implementation of buildpacks on their stack sucks? They have the only real implemenation of buildpacks? I agree forking/maintaining the fork sucks, I think there should be an easier way to install apt-get dependencies (ENV var).<p>Alternatively you can use: <a href=""https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi</a> which supports versioning and chaining. You just make a buildpack for your custom bits, and install it before your ruby buildpack<p>I agree I don&#x27;t often switch between ruby interpreters, however I do frequently upgrade MRI ruby versions, and the fact that it as easy as changing one line has saved me a lot of time. IMO this is much easier than any alternative I am aware of.<p>I have written a few buildpacks and I have found buildpack multi to be pretty composable.<p>I agree Dockerfiles are a decent alternative, however the part missing is a scheduling/discovery layer. Mesos docker integration is coming along via the folks at mesosphere but you still need to wire up the bits and pieces yourself.<p>3. I agree it is expensive, I think it is cheaper than a full time ops person to a pretty decent scale, and I think you need a lot more than 1 ops person to get close in terms of SLA, and featureset.<p>Honestly I think you just traded one set of problems for another. Who is going to get paged when both the vm&#x27;s hosting a service die? Who is going to get paged when you run out of disk space? Co-location of apps? Hosting multiple ruby versions on all your hosts?<p>I don&#x27;t fully appreciate your model but IMO it sounds like you have a client expectations problem.You should set the deliverable as a deployable app with the target as heroku, if they want to pay more for a VM they can pay more but they should understand the tradeoffs. If they want their own custom maintained servers or pay for you to maintain them, but it ain&#x27;t free. It will cost you time and hopefully their money.<p>I don&#x27;t swap language often if ever, however I do like to use more than one language depending on the problem I am solving.",1403588787

What this means is that over 3000 people per year will be killed by self-driving cars.

Once you can afford 3 people this can become a very effective way of ensuring 24 hour coverage.<p>Between all the countries in australasia and Europe 24 hour coverage is not that difficult. Not to mention rates for a lot of those countries are cheaper then FTE&#x27;s in the US and if you bring them on as contractors, you still get to avoid having a business presence in those countries (for Tax and what have you).",1403587801

Most people in Khruschev&#x27;s era lived in wooden temporary buildings (many of them stand till now, completely uninhabitable) built right after the war, or dormitories, or communal apartments (which were build in Stalin era and were normally very well built, except a family got a single room in 6-8 room apartment). Very few, upper class people could get a whole apartment of that kind. These indeed, had thick walls, high ceilings, were well-designed and still form a highly sought after part of real estate in Russian cities (while not many were built).<p>And yes, Khruschevkis were a good thing because they, as primitive and oversimplified as they were, were the only way for most families to move to the city from countryside, or to get their private housing for the first time.",1403587660
