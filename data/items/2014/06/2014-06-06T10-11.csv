You can&#x27;t transfer value before something has value. Also, act of transferring or fees does not generate value either.<p>Bitcoin units are rare collectibles. Like gold coins or USD paper bills. They are scarce, hard to counterfeit and they are portable and fungible. They are easy to collect. Once you have a club of people who collect them and speculatively value them, this club can grow (or shrink). If such token is superior than others, then some people will likely sell their inferior tokens in order to acquire superior ones. This way the club grows.<p>Plus, there is value in liquidity. People generally want to store wealth in something &quot;secure&quot; which means not only secure in terms of storage (personal vault, swiss bank account etc.), but also in terms of purchasing power. The more and quicker I can buy myself something I suddenly need, the more secure my wealth is. E.g. if my computer breaks and I need a new one, my cash will help me buy a new one better than a collection of postal stamps. So people will generally prefer to keep savings in money that is more marketable, i.e. valued by more people. This means that once a superior collectible starts to grow, it will drive the value of inferior collectibles down to zero. (However, if there are currency controls and banking regulation in your country, then you might be stuck with a less marketable local currency.)<p>Nick Szabo explains how money evolved: <a href=""http://szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://szabo.best.vwh.net/shell.html</a><p>I explained why we all want one universal money:\n<a href=""http://blog.oleganza.com/post/54121516413/the-universe-wants-one-money"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.oleganza.com/post/54121516413/the-universe-wants...</a>",1402052358

I&#x27;ve now spent time with Charlie Duke, Alan Bean, and TK Mattingly, and without exception it takes time to get them to open up and talk about these things.<p>I used to wonder why, but I had an in-depth conversation with someone a while ago who was similarly reluctant.  She said:<p><pre><code>    People ask, but usually they don&#x27;t really care.\n    And if they do care, they usually won&#x27;t make\n        the effort to understand.\n    And if they do make the effort to understand,\n        they usually don&#x27;t have the background or\n        experience to understand.\n    And if they do understand, I don&#x27;t need to have\n        explained.\n</code></pre>\nTaking the time, making the effort, explicitly acknowledging that you&#x27;ll never fully understand and yet being willing to make the effort to appreciate their experience, then you can get people to tell their stories.<p>Otherwise they won&#x27;t, and you&#x27;ll miss out.",1402052317

7857125,comment,7856902,7857089,6,0,leoedin,,,"For reference, I work in the space industry, where piles of paperwork are produced to justify any component selection decision. I can&#x27;t imagine a situation where anything, even down to individual capacitors, would be selected without at least 2 people having some input to that selection. Our qualification processes are absolutely massive and take decades though - not particularly suitable for the automotive industry.<p>I don&#x27;t think that this can be compared directly to the kind of adhoc software development that is routine in many places. Engineering processes have developed over decades to eliminate human error and very, very rarely allow single unjustified decisions made by a single person to propegate through to a finished product.<p>I&#x27;m surprised that in a world where individual car platforms cost billions of dollars to develop there was never a point at which the switch selection was challenged. I haven&#x27;t read the full report though - perhaps it&#x27;s not quite as the news article suggests.

But this is probably not because of Fortran is slow and Java is fast, but because the whole benchmark results are pretty much a coincidence of bad coding and if someone else wrote it, the results could be as well completely reversed.

I actually knew that already because the company I used to work for helped build software for them and Grant and Nick spoke at our company event. They blew us all away.<p>I think this was just before or right after they had launched Next. Their description of the reservation ticketing system and the variable pricing model seemed awesome then.  Glad to see it worked out so well.<p>But what really made an impression on me was Grant&#x27;s discussion of the similarity of software user experience design and his own dining experience design.  He talked about how he&#x27;s not just making food but controlling an entire experience for the diner.  That includes the interesting centerpieces on the table that are used in the meal, the narrow entrance hall to the restaurant, the use of smoke and smell to evoke memories.  I&#x27;m completely sure the user experience of the reservation system is a piece he considers a part of the overall dining experience.  Whether or not actual conversion numbers are there to justify investing in it, I bet these guys consider it one of the intangibles that make their restaurants the best fine dining experiences in the country.<p>One of the stories that sticks out for me was Grant&#x27;s explanation of the trickiness involved in not having tablecloths.  At the time, he said, fine dining meant white tablecloths. But he didn&#x27;t want there to be tablecloths at Alinea.  So he got rid of them. But the problem was water rings.  When cold water was placed on the stone tables, rings of condensation formed.  He said they solved the problem by finding the precise temperature at which the water was chilled but not cold enough to form condensation rings on the table and they keep it at exactly that temperature in the kitchen.<p>Something about that story says to me that he understands that the quality of the experience lies in the substance and not the decoration.  I haven&#x27;t actually used the reservation system.  I went to Alinea before it was used there and I haven&#x27;t been to Next.  So I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ugly but I doubt it sucks.

Thanks for trying to be Devil&#x27;s advocate!<p>However, I feel that this issue is one of misrepresentation. Netflix wants Verizon to be a common carrier, and have its revenue increase linearly with the amount of data it transfers.\nIn that case, Verizon would happily increase their revenue by providing actually faster Internet, because customers would pay more per day if they downloaded more per day, since they&#x27;d then pay a fixed amount per GigaBit.<p>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t understand what Verizon wants to be. I feel like the type of company it wants to be is only sustainable in the very short run, highly dependent on other companies such as Netflix, and incapable of good PR because what clients want, and what they subscribe for, is impossible to deliver (the amount of data clients want to transfer is always above whatever they can promise to offer). That market positioning is tolerable for instant Wall Street growth, but it is detrimental to customers, to website owners, to peering partners, and to the long-term future of the company, were a reasonable competitor to enter the market.<p>I also feel there could be a middle ground, such as Verizon asking customers from every city to tip in for a massive city-wide network upgrade. That would be good for PR and customers would happily donate. It seems fitting, because from what I understand, the real money eater is a one-off upgrade; it doesn&#x27;t increase maintenance costs much, if at all.",1402050605

I simply wanted to acknowledge that the average freshman at Harvard or Williams probably sees a harder test than her counterpart at Ohio State. The price and prestige of a school are not always good indicators of quality, but I am very confident that selective schools that receive the top students have curricula to challenge those students. There are certainly exceptions: I go to a private university that is leagues behind some of the top public institutions: Berkeley, UCLA, UMich (among others) provide excellent educations, and they are much more academically rigorous than my private institution and many like it.<p>I am not saying that students who go to a private college are &quot;better&quot; or more likely to succeed. My point is that more selective (and generally private) schools are accustomed to receiving students that have been groomed for academic success throughout high school, and thus the bar for academic rigor starts out at a higher level. The crux of my original comment was to propose a solution for identifying just how high the bar is set on that first batch of exams, to see if you are ready. Knowing what is coming would prevent the overwhelming feeling of depression and &quot;not belonging&quot; that comes with failing a test in a new, scary environment.

Do not do this.<p>To expand, remember that regular employment comes with way more &#x27;compensation&#x27; than just the salary that a freelacing gig doesn&#x27;t come with. As a regular employee, you get paid regularly, on time, based on hours, you get paid holidays, taxes paid, etc. A freelancer/contractor has much less certaintly and much more risk. Hence freelancers should be paid more per hour/day/week than a regular employee.<p>> Think about mockups/wireframes you can deliver.<p>Hint: Don&#x27;t make the mockup look done. Use a mockup style that looks like drawing on a napkin (or even draw it on paper and send a photo of that paper). Non-techies think the amount of work depends on the amount of UI changes. If they see a pixel perfect photoshop image of a done web page, they could think that all the work is done.",1402048956

You&#x27;re more than welcome to provide other numbers if you have a way of getting them.<p>And I provide exact numbers for the girl under discussion. Someone else was nice enough to point out that the ACT average for students at UT Austin is 28 (91st percentile nationwide), and the 25th percentile is 25 (80th). This girl got 22 (62nd). Compared to the average student at her school, that&#x27;s abysmally low.<p>From memory, the range for verbal scores at caltech was 720-800, and the range at UT Austin was 120 points. The &quot;true top end&quot; at caltech probably isn&#x27;t that far above 800, since the writing range was 720-790, so UT Austin is displaying much much more variation (120 points compared to 80). In contrast, there&#x27;s going to be a lot more variation in math ability at caltech than the 30-point math range implies, due to the very low ceiling on the SAT-math. That makes it impossible to say how much variation there really is by looking at SAT scores.<p>On the other other hand, caltech being a technical school, you might suspect that they&#x27;re targeting math ability, and the range <i>should</i> be narrower than it is for verbal. ;p<p>>  Because nearly a quarter of students will be below the bottom quartile - at every school.<p>You could change this to exactly a quarter and you wouldn&#x27;t be wrong (except in cases like, as we&#x27;ve seen, caltech and other high-end schools, where well over a quarter of the students are in the <i>top</i> 25th percentile by math SAT score).  But the sentence preceding it is obviously false. Yes, a quarter of the group will always be in the bottom 25%. Does that mean they&#x27;re not performing as well as the rest of the group? Of course it does. That&#x27;s how we measured them.<p>If your top students and your worst students are very close in ability because of restriction in range, you can sensibly put them in the same classes. If, as at UT Austin, they&#x27;re very far apart, you can&#x27;t. I went to a large public university myself, and the course catalog was full of classes covering the same material but differentiated by &quot;difficulty&quot;. What&#x27;s wrong with describing the students who can&#x27;t succeed outside of the bottom tier as &quot;substandard&quot;?",1402048896
