My understanding of market rates in the Valley is that if you can solo-prototype hardware your market rate is probably substantially north of that.  (If you put a gun to my head and said &quot;Pick a number!&quot; I&#x27;d say &quot;Oh please don&#x27;t shoot 140k!&quot;)<p>2)  The options you receive are not directly comparable to stock of public companies in terms of variance of returns.  +/- 90% of options in startups will be <i>valueless</i>.<p>3)  You ask what is acceptable.  Anything which you and they agree on is acceptable.  As your peer who wants to see you get the best deal possible, I would strongly suggest negotiating primarily for hard currency and treating the equity like the lottery ticket that it is.<p>4)  It is not the customary practice of Silicon Valley firms to award equity for temporary (2 month) positions.  A company doing that is signaling bad things about its likelihood for future success.  Silicon Valley firms which need specialized contract work done for them raise money and then pay market rates for it.  (n.b. Market rates are probably at $10k+ per week.  Yes, that&#x27;s a much larger number than the salary we discussed earlier.  Ask if you don&#x27;t understand why that would be true.)",1392778711
7261534,comment,7258233,7259551,3,0,lexcorvus,,,"With phrases like &quot;economic activity&quot; and &quot;mindless hoarding&quot;, you&#x27;re using language that short-circuits critical thinking. You&#x27;re on the right track, though, with your parenthetical note, so let&#x27;s start by replacing &quot;economic activity&quot; with &quot;spending&quot;. Then, instead of using the inflammatory phrase &quot;mindless hoarding&quot;, let&#x27;s use the word &quot;saving&quot;.<p>With this neutral terminology, we&#x27;re now ready for some actual thought. We can recast the claim as follows: <i>devaluation is good because it encourages spending and discourages saving</i>. There&#x27;s no doubt about the factual claim—devaluation does indeed encourage spending and discourage saving. But why is saving bad and spending good? This is an ethical judgment that depends on your particular set of values, but it is undeniable that devaluation (currency dilution) transfers purchasing power from savers to spenders. In particular, it&#x27;s mathematically equivalent to combining a perfectly hard currency with forced confiscation (from savers) and transfer (to spenders), i.e., organized theft. Thus, from an ethical point of view, there is a strong reason <i>not</i> to give devaluation the benefit of the doubt.<p>And yet, so far as I can tell, devaluation is <i>always</i> given the benefit of the doubt by the mainstream. Doesn&#x27;t that seem odd?",1392778680

7261525,comment,7258233,7258614,6,0,stalcottsmith,,,"> The U.S. central banking system ranks among the finest of its kind.<p>I agree...<p>> Central banking is possibly the greatest human invention since sanitation.<p>This is a most deceptive and inherently political statement.  Sanitation is a great invention for everyone.  Central banking not so much.<p>Central banking and centralised control of the money supply serve to concentrate the greatest opportunity for skimming the surplus generated by vast productive populations into the hands a very few people to direct as they wish.  Whether this process is controlled democratically or not (and in the US it most certainly is not) is not the point.<p>The way this is done in the US is no different in principle to the way it is done by elite in more obviously &quot;corrupt&quot; countries.  In the US, it is more sophisticated and over the last century it has attained the patina of established respectability.  In the US they have managed to set this system up without killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. (the surplus-producing population)<p>The skimming in the US is accomplished first through powerful central taxation which requires centralised record keeping and control of the banking sector.  Secondly wealth and accumulated surplus is skimmed (redistributed upwards) through the control of credit extended by banks to generally expand and potentially to &quot;contract&quot; the money (credit) supply.  Inflation generally rewards large debtors and punishes savers.<p>Skimming is also accomplished by helping to grow and trade in government debt (granting incredibly valuable concessions to favoured dealers), assisting in managing capital flows into and out of the country, extending vast credits to powerful interest groups (mostly bankers) thereby helping powerful private borrowers to lean on the public credit for private gain, and most importantly and tragically to make possible and in fact encourage wars of choice which are clearly to the benefit of private interests and clearly not of any benefit to the general public.  Is it any wonder that the Fed was created by bankers and war financiers, for the benefit of bankers and war financiers?  This goes back to Morgan and others and their intimate involvement in the financing of Britain and France and subsequent agitation for American entry into WWI.<p>Central banking is most convenient and necessary for anyone wishing to control or direct economic activity and hence the lives of others.  That is why it appeals to statists of all persuasions who perceive it as powerful lever or tool they hope employ in their fantasies of control.  Prominent early communists saw state-controlled central banking as an essential step for converting a capitalist system to a communist one.  That is also why most &quot;crazy libertarians&quot; find their way to a stance opposing central banking.  Central banking is anathema to Liberty.  Jefferson killed the first Bank of the United States and exposed it as an agent of foreign interests.  (The capital for the first bank was created by an early scam which had people talk down the debts of the continental congress and buy up the IOUs from the poor soldiers who fought for the revolution for a few pennies on the dollar, and then lobby successfully for the debts to be assumed and honored at face value by the new constitutional government.  This was a similar scam to the way the oligarchs in Russia convinced newly enriched peasants to sell their shares in state assets for cheap.)  Jackson killed the Second Bank of the United States for much the same reasons as Jefferson had a generation before.  Seventy years later, a true, well documented conspiracy of financiers, gave the US its third central bank.<p>I agree with other posters, that one must look at the actions and histories of many different central banks in different countries to understand the nature of the beast.  The US is only the most competent in obfuscating its nature, purpose and origin.  It has &quot;won&quot; at the central banking game for almost 100 years.  Your praise of the US&#x27;s central bank comes at the zenith of its power.  I suspect over the next 10 years, it will resemble its cousins in less competent regimes and juridictions more and more.<p>The US central bank, aka the Fed, is a brilliant creation.  It is a brilliant creation of the fevered minds of oligarchs to defend and advance their oligarchy.  It has lasted 100 years.  I hope it will not last another 100.  With Idiocracy increasingly fast upon us, the prospects for change are not good.  Bitcoin to the moon.",1392778389

I helped a startup (2 founders) for a few days by designing and building hardware of the first prototype. They want to hire me but they cannot pay 100k/yr for salary. Instead, they want to offer me part cash and part stock. I&#x27;m very new to Silicon Valley and know little about the invest stages of a startup. For me it is completely new to get my salary partly in cash and partly in stock.<p>Let me give you some background about the company, before I post my questions. Right now the startup has 2 founders in Silicon Valley and a few people doing software in another country. The founders are very convinced about the future success of their product. They have more than 10 years experience in founding and have started several companies. Those companies are so successful that now they can spent 100% of their time on this new startup. They are currently in the seed fase and want to show of with the first prototype to possible customers. They have self funded this new startup.<p>For my personal situation: Normally I would ask a salary equal to my market value of $100k/yr. I need at least $50k/yr to pay my bills and to save a little. I have never worked for a startup in Europe or US, so I&#x27;m completely new to company stock.<p>So here are the questions:\n- Is there a big risk in stock?\n- is it acceptable to have 50% cash and 50% stock?\n- what salary should I ask for a temporary position (2mo&#x27;s), and how is it divided into cash and stock?\n- what salary should I ask for a long term position (>1yr), and how is it divided into cash and stock?\n- where can I learn best about salary for engineers in startup companies?<p>I really appreciate your replies! Thanks!",1392778187

That way of thinking makes no sense at all in this instance.<p>During the last years there have been many indie games with a strong narrative focus. His mission statement together with his actions (small team, digital distribution) fits more with that than free to play mobile only games.<p>It seems to me as though Ken Levine saw that he was making very narrative focused games (Bioshock Infinite in particular) with a side dish of shooting for that AAA appeal. Maybe he also saw all the indie developers making games with narrative focus who were not afraid of getting rid of such AAA trappings altogether because with digital distribution everyone can reach their niche and make sustainable amounts of money.<p>Ken Levine is obviously not going all the way, but he is going pretty far with the downscaling (and it’s always worth to talk about whether he has gone the right way). AAA development gets you some nice things (God Only Knows sung by a barbershop quartet, for example) but comes with its own set of restrictions (you have to go for mass appeal) and when you want to make something smaller and more focused that doesn’t appeal to everyone then there’s lots to be said for getting smaller.<p>(During the last few years we have seen the middle fall out from game development, with mid-sized developers and publishers going under. It seems that this gap is now filled from the bottom and the top, with former AAA developers scaling down and successful indie developers – Jonathan Blow with The Witness, Mike Bithell with Volume, … – scaling up.)<p>There is whole diverse and crazy world below AAA titles. Some of those games are awful, but some are awesome. There is lots that can be done. And lots of cool things that are done.<p>Why would you think of Candy Crush first? Especially the mention of the narrative focus makes me think of many excellent (and successful!) recent indie titles that also had a strong narrative focus: Stanley Parable, Gone Home, Kentucky Route Zero, …<p>It seems to me that Ken Levine has something like that in mind plus his own game mechanics twist (the highly repayable part, whatever that means), certainly not some free to play mobile only bullshit.",1392778183
