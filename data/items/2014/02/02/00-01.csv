7164246,comment,7163818,7164120,10,0,UnoriginalGuy,,,"The Linux community doesn&#x27;t help either. Some of them want to be inclusive, but the majority of the community think that Linux should be an exclusive club where only those with a high level of knowledge should get treated with any kind of respect or help. Just go Google any Linux topic, and I assure you the first page will contain several forum post where the only response is &quot;RTFM,&quot; &quot;if you cannot figure this out you shouldn&#x27;t be touching it (audio issues)&quot; (paraphrasing), or even &quot;maybe you&#x27;d be better off using Windows teehee.&quot;<p>I think Ubuntu has done much to make Linux more consumer friendly and I congratulate them for that. But realistically Android or Chrome OS (Chromebook, etc) are the only two Linux OSs I&#x27;d likely use on a daily basis because in both cases they abstract you away from the ugly Linux innards better than any standard distro&#x27; is able to do.<p>The fact that Linux depends so heavily on the terminal/console is just pathetic. It reminds me of Windows 9x. Which is kind of depressing when you consider that the Linux kernel is the most advanced kernel currently in existence, but they get weighed down by the UNIX legacy stuff, users, and GNU side of things.<p>That&#x27;s why Android is so wonderful. Instead of it being Linux/GNU, it is Linux/Android. When we get a full desktop OS without the GNU gunk and the associated bad-attitude (&quot;terminal is the bestest, I am so 1337!!!&quot;) I&#x27;d happily switch to it. Hell I&#x27;d switch to a Linux/Android OS if Google and friends made one for the PC desktop (with real windows/multi-tasking).<p>OS X is also a great UNIX OS because there is no terminal fallback. You can do 90%+ of things you&#x27;d ever need to do on OS X via UIs and tools. Plus the community on OS X is better than the toxic Linux community, even if they&#x27;re a little defensive when people criticize Apple/OS X.",1391302392

You can decide for yourself if a 1/2600 risk is acceptable to you, but doctors are in a position to decide for a far larger number of people.<p>If 10m people are exposed per year to the given risk you outline, the expected number of additional cancers is ~4k people over 20y.

I don&#x27;t have experience with Fedora&#x27;s and I don&#x27;t know why it entered an inconsistent state, but OSX/iOS use a package manager. Android uses a package manager. What problem could you possibly have with package managers? Do you enjoy manually updating software one app at a time?<p>The answer in &quot;Linuxland&quot; may still be to open the terminal and enter commands but the times a regular user needs to do that are becoming few and very far between.

Meh.<p>As they say, it is very easy to criticise someone else for at least trying something and very hard to solve it yourself. I will fully admit that I have no better ideas for how to both keep the classic desktop but also integrate the new touch screen &quot;metro&quot; elements into it.<p>I really do have to say that I think Apple has the &quot;best&quot; solution right now. iOS for touch devices (iPad, iPhone, iPod) and OS X for desktop. Then they get to sit back and make an absolutely wonderful user experience for both scenarios without worrying about the potential crossover.<p>If I was in charge of Windows that is likely what I would do. Make Windows for Desktop and Windows for Touch, with starkly different UIs and designs, but with some emulation layer so people can run a touch app on the desktop (in like a sandbox window).<p>Frankly Windows Desktop has a LOT of crust on it. Go look at Control Panel. They have UIs unchanged since Windows 9x (Mouse, Keyboard, etc), then they have UIs added in XP (Firewall), then different ones added in Vista (Action Centre, etc), and now in 8 we have &quot;Change PC Settings&quot; which is another UI concept again.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever used OS X for any amount of time, the thing is just polished and consistent from top to bottom. I mean go compare OS X &quot;Preferences&quot; to Control Panel on Windows 8, and Apple manage to get that kind of consistent polish all over the place.<p>Microsoft cannot kill the Windows Desktop as much as they might wish, so for the love of god go through from top to bottom and modernise it.

Developers can put in enough effort to get the base game up and running, and then use IAP to spur additional content development throughout the life of the game.<p>I&#x27;m thinking specifically of Hero Academy here. A really neat little turn-based strategy game which cost a few bucks when it came out, and had (I think) 3 teams to choose from the beginning. More teams or different skins for your team cost extra. This was the best use of IAP I&#x27;ve seen, and facilitated the devs getting what was essentially a proof of concept out, then building on it.<p>For gamers it gave you the freedom to just buy the base game, or only pay for the additional features/teams etc that you felt were interesting. I would never have paid $20 for that game off the bat, but because I had the freedom to choose what I DID buy, I probably ended up spending a lot more, and happily so.<p>So IAP is not inherently bad, it&#x27;s just frequently (and intentionally) misused to turn games into cash generating slot machines via intentionally bad game design.

So, you can&#x27;t made typo in this scenario - the code won&#x27;t compile.<p>I.e., you declare:<p><pre><code>    -record(foo, {bar = ?default_bar, baz = ?default_baz}).\n</code></pre>\nAnd every time you write #foo{bar = 1} you get {foo, 1, ?default_baz} under the hood.

And writing MyFoo#foo.bar is cumbersome, compared to MyFoo.bar in most other languages.<p>Another issue is that records exist only before pre-processing.

Any idea you have on nuclear energy or its application that you may think everybody knows about, everybody doesn&#x27;t know about: Just come to my office and tell me the idea.&quot;<p>So Feynman pointed out to Smith there are a bunch of ideas and it&#x27;s crazy to tell them all. He gives four examples, and leaves.<p>> About three months later, Smith calls me in the office and says, &quot;Feynman, the submarine has already been taken. But the other three are yours.&quot;<p>> ... Anyway, Smith told me to sign some papers for the three ideas I was giving to the government to patent. Now, it&#x27;s some dopey legal thing, but when you give the patent to the government, the document you sign is not a legal document unless there&#x27;s some exchange, so the paper I signed said, &quot;For the sum of one dollar, I, Richard P. Feynman, give this idea to the government . . .&quot;<p>The rest of the story is about the $1, and how the other scientists, once they found how easy it was to get a dollar, started sending patent ideas.",1391301187

The barrier to entry is too high, and they don&#x27;t know if they are going to get a good experience. They can&#x27;t pick up my app and hold it, feel it, rub their hands over it&#x27;s quality. They have 5 screenshots (and any reviews online) to go by. Okay, so I&#x27;ll make it free to lower that barrier.<p>But now how do I make money? I think the best thing to do is to simply have users pay for content that they have already proved they love. Let them play through 50 levels, or the first &quot;area&quot; of the game. Let them buy more levels or unlock more content. This way they can play the game and decide if they like it, and if so, buy more.<p>I think the two rules of thumb about this sort of IAP is:\n1: Don&#x27;t be a asshole. Give the user a lot of completely unaltered content up front, and really let them dive into the game. Ensure they know that buying the rest of the game later will cost some money, but don&#x27;t take away features because they haven&#x27;t bought the game yet. Let them fall in love with it.\n2: Price it fairly. Let users buy &quot;All Levels Forever&quot; for $5, or each level pack for $2. Allow them to unlock all the content at once. If they bought 2 levels packs, and want to buy all the rest later, give them a discount.<p>Make a game you&#x27;d want to play.",1391300659

There is little real strategy or challenge to the main paths of the games (the secret dungeons are another story), you just keep &quot;grinding&quot; for money and EXP until you eventually get strong enough to venture into the next area and move the story along. Even if you die, you don&#x27;t lose your progress, you just restart at the last town with half the gold you were carrying.<p>It might sound a bit dull when I put it that way, but the series is enormously popular in Japan amongst all kinds of people that you wouldn&#x27;t ever consider to be interested in video games.
