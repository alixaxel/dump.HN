I believe you captured the problem with school-level math.<p>As an anecdote for you, since you&#x27;re a mathematician: during school I had zero patience for math. I would often study just enough to get a passing grade. On the other hand, I enjoyed physics classes a lot, it involved more problem solving and holistic vision than memorization (since you can just memorize a couple formulas and derive everything else you need - e.g. the second and third equations of motion from the first). Maybe I would have enjoyed math classes more if it involved more intuition and less rote?

7221515,comment,7220917,7220917,9,0,sparkie,,,"We don&#x27;t need a new build system, we need a new mentality.<p>The problem with build systems is they don&#x27;t cover the entire scope required to actually build software reliably. Ideally, you want to take just your code as input and produce a target, but the reality is that you&#x27;re taking your code, plus an environment with potentially infinite number of configuration options, and you&#x27;re asking the build system to produce a target. This is effectively saying &quot;Here&#x27;s some code and some shit, please do your wizardry and make me something that <i>looks like this</i>.&quot; Is it any wonder that every proposed solution to this difficult (impossible?) problem gets it wrong?<p>The <i>correct solution</i> is to declare the target you want, then build up the dependencies you need as input to meet that target and declare them explicitly, then perform the build in that isolated environment to ensure that no undeclared configuration options can alter the result of the build. This is what Nix (<a href=""http://nixos.org/nix/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nixos.org/nix/</a>) does, and by derivation, Guix (<a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/</a>), and Debian&#x27;s ReproducibleBuilds is also attempting. The build process becomes effectively a pure function, free of unwanted side-effects.<p>Nix doesn&#x27;t actually perform builds in itself, except for trivial ./configure && make. It piggy-backs on existing build systems via bash scripts if needed, but it completely manages the environment in which such script will run, so it has local-side effects which are controlled, similar to how you might use the ST monad in place of IO in Haskell perhaps.<p>I find Guix a bit more interesting because it can take on the whole problem - including the build system. While it can piggy-back on existing build systems in the same way Nix can, you can also write your own in Guile (or some other language and invoke from Guile). It doesn&#x27;t really make sense to depend on the old cruft under this new mentality, because things like pkg-config are obsoleted by known, explicitly declared dependencies. The build process can be simplified (and probably sped-up).",1392162958

You would watch as other students painfully go through the motions of getting their form down: positioning the javelin at just the right angle, doing that weird prancing motion as they run, and gripping it <i>just so</i>. All the while your natural strength and ability bested their most valiant efforts. However, over the course of months and years of training, their form improved. Their technique got better. And soon, they were constantly besting your every throw.<p>This is the point at which your natural talent is exhausted and now you too need to learn the technique in order to make any advances. The problem  is that your fellow athletes have already put in their 10,000 hours mastering the technique and building their muscle memory to achieve the best possible throw. And you rapidly fall behind, unable to keep up with their slow but relentless progress.<p>This is actually a poor analogy for knowledge work, but a similar principle applies. Many people get by being able to easily soak in the knowledge and intuit the correct solutions without having to put in much effort at all. Even if they fully understand the theory and practice of how to mechanically arrive at a solution, the habit of not having to invest significant energy in determining a solution stays with them. The problems get harder, beyond what their capacity to intuit affords them. Gaps in their knowledge become magnified and soon their understanding of a subject is shown to be a shallow house of cards. At this point, they could choose to accept that they need to completely change strategies, fill in the gaps, and no longer rely on their intuitition. However, habits die hard and many struggle in vain to wrap their heads around the problems instead of working through them systematically.

I missed the color of his couch, but guessed correctly where he bought his furniture, what kind of car he drove and was likely to buy and why, what TV shows he watched, what music he listened to (and had listened to in the past), the clothes he did and didn&#x27;t have in his closet, what kind of food he liked and where he liked to shop, I picked his neighborhood, choice of home computer, where he wanted to retire and even a handful of books he probably had in his home library.

This is probably the least valid reason, but sometimes you do not know going in whether or not a function you are writing will be async. If you create a sync interface, it will need to be changed if the function needs to be async in the future, or if it needs to pass additional results.

City Downstream chips in for a bunch of guys to go up there and beat the shit out of the owners of that factory. Let&#x27;s assume a scenario in which all citizens of City Upstream work for that factory, so they all want to keep their jobs and so they all chip in for a bunch of guys to protect them (or a company hires those guys on their behalf). Now, those guys meet up. Are they going to fight? Highly unlikely, because it is in their personal self interest to resolve this conflict peacefully AND collect the money from the people who hired them. What are they gonna do? They&#x27;re gonna compare the balance of power. If it&#x27;s equal then they&#x27;re gonna settle for the solution that satisfies both equally. If City Downstream, which obviously is concerned with its health more than City Upstream workers are concerned with keeping their job, hires more tough guys, the balance of power would be in its favor and thus you can expect more drastic measures to be agreed upon. Then remember, we talked about an edge case, when all citizens of City Upstream work at a factory. However, that is very unlikely. Thus it may turn out to be that one factory would be up against the whole city.<p>Of course in reality, no one would actually hire tough guys, but rather such conflicts would be resolved through more civilized private protection agencies and courts.

We&#x27;re about to assassinate a US citizen who&#x27;s on foreign soil.<p><i>Framers:</i> WHAT?!?!?<p><i>NSA:</i> Well... it&#x27;s a tough situation.<p><i>F:</i> NONONONO. This is not acceptable under any circumstance! What the hell??<p><i>NSA:</i> Well, he&#x27;s joined a foreign army. And we&#x27;re at war with that army. We&#x27;ve been at war with them for a really long time.<p><i>F:</i> So what? Why do you have to assassinate him? He&#x27;ll meet you on the field of battle somewhere, and he&#x27;ll fight and live or die just like any other soldier.<p><i>NSA:</i> Well yeah, that&#x27;s the thing. This army doesn&#x27;t ever fight our army. They disguise themselves as civilians and bomb our own civilians, or the civilians of other countries.<p><i>F:</i> Huh.<p><i>NSA:</i> Ya. They don&#x27;t really even try to attack our military. They seem pretty happy just killing bystanders.<p><i>F:</i> So just arrest him and bring him to trial then.<p><i>NSA:</i> Well... he&#x27;s living in a lawless part of the world. The nominal government there doesn&#x27;t have the ability to arrest him. And it&#x27;s too dangerous to send our own officers to make the arrest. But we&#x27;ve got this <i>really cool</i> weapon which can kill him from afar.<p><i>F:</i> So this guy has joined an army which he knows is at war with the US, he&#x27;s stationed in an area where no legitimate government - even our own - can reasonably arrest him, and there&#x27;s no foreseen situation in which our army and his army will actually get to fight?<p><i>NSA:</i> Yup.<p>--<p>The extraordinary nature of this situation is what, to my mind, makes such assassinations totally unthreatening to traditional notions of law, moral war, and international order. If the guy were located in any part of the world with a functioning and accountable government, the situation would be different: in that case, the US gov&#x27;t must work with local authorities to bring him to justice.<p>So no, I&#x27;m not talking about waging war in the whole world.
