The _idea_ of democracy has evolved over a long time, but most countries did not have a long local tradition of applying it or building institutions at time it became political reality. Britain and the U.S are not typical examples of how democracy is introduced.<p>In many cases it was an idea that took hold in the minds of a smallish group of political activists and thinkers who observed what happened elsewhere and adapted it. In fact, one of the most pressing problems of those activists has always been how to get &quot;the people&quot; interested in it at all. And most of the time it wasn&#x27;t democratic principles that got people interested but economic interests.<p>In other words, the introduction of democracy was rarely very democratic or purely homegrown or very principled or very peaceful or free of foreign influence. The old powers were often toppled under rather chaotic and opportunistic circumstances. That slow cultural process you&#x27;re describing, which supposedly only works when there are no civil wars, foreign invasions, ethnic or religious conflicts or poor economy, is the exception, not the rule.<p>Also, the whole concept of &quot;foreign&quot; is flawed when it comes to ideas.

Revising an original claim to handle a counterexample is something that is essential in actual conversations.

Yes, Ballmer wasn&#x27;t a &quot;consumer&quot; guy either, which is precisely why they&#x27;ve missed so many consumer waves already since he&#x27;s been at the helm. I don&#x27;t know if they can afford another &quot;Ballmer&quot; in the consumer space.<p>I think Nadella will do what &quot;feels natural&quot; to him, and will move Microsoft &quot;up-market&quot; from the consumer space, which will probably become increasingly less profitable for them, so moving &quot;where the profits are&quot; (i.e. not in the consumer market) will start to make a lot of sense to them.",1391253588

Speak freely.&quot;<p>You care not about real anonymity, you just care about selling the concept behind it, giving a false sense of safety, just to profit from that, riding on the wings of the need from IT uneducated people to protect themselves now that the alarmism is very high given to what we understood about NSA.<p>Or, is it just profit?
