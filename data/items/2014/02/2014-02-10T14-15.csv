An example of a bad case: if the network interface is hotplugged or down and you&#x27;re running Redis, do you want it to restart and have to drag the entire AOF file off disk just because you yanked the interface card because it was failed or failing? Your 20 second hotplug problem becomes a 15 minute block of IO coming off disk because you had to restart the process.<p>So many problems come from such a simple dependency.<p>Designing all services to handle and expect failures and just let init restart regardless of the state is the RIGHT solution.",1392044374

The medium US income is only about $50,000.  Even if you spread the number out over 10 years (which would of course also increase the total interest paid), you are talking about $1,500 a year, which would be roughly 100% of people&#x27;s discretionary income.<p>3.  The number is growing and will continue to grow forever which means that the drag increases overtime, not that it gets paid off.<p>4.  The student loans any individual borrows may individually benefit them relative to others, but there is no reason to believe that the total revenue (salary) grows at the same rate as the drag caused by the increase in debt service on a macro scale.<p>Its $1 trillion + interest that will drag on the economy for many, many, many years.  You can&#x27;t look at the trees in the forest to rationalize away the problem this huge debt load will have on the economy.",1392044350

7211350,comment,7205759,7209908,1,0,tmoertel,,,"OK. I think I see where our signals are getting crossed. I look at your diagram and think, The green signal <i>g</i> is not what you get when you try to output the red signal <i>r</i> but the output stage clips it at the supply voltage (my <i>V</i>).  Rather, the green signal <i>g</i> is what you get when you take the red signal <i>r</i>, amplify it by <i>A</i> = Infinity, and <i>then</i> try to output that new signal <i>rA</i>, which the output stage then clips.<p>For all <i>A</i> > 1, |<i>rA</i>| > |<i>r</i>|. Therefore, I have no problem agreeing that a clipped <i>rA</i> carries more energy than the original <i>r</i>.  (In fact, this is just saying that bigger signals carry more energy, regardless of clipping.)<p>To me, your original statement read as though it made the following claim:  If your amplifier tries to <i>output</i> a signal <i>r</i> but clips off the peaks, what you get out is a signal that carries more energy than <i>r</i>.  (This is the claim I found hard to believe.)<p>But what you really meant (I think) was that, if you take a sine wave as <i>input</i> and, as a human controlling the volume knob, keep turning up the volume until the sine wave&#x27;s maximum amplitude so far exceeds what the amplifier can reproduce that it comes out looking like a square wave, then that square wave carries more energy than the original, un-volume-adjusted sine wave. Is that what you meant?<p>If that&#x27;s what you meant, I have no problem believing your claim. It&#x27;s just that I wouldn&#x27;t call turning up the volume knob to be part of the &quot;clipping&quot; process, but rather amplifying. When you turn up the volume knob, what you get out is always a &quot;bigger&quot; signal, even if it&#x27;s clipped.",1392044160

Microsoft has an extensive partner sales network and a lot of companies already using many of its infrastructure products. They write the SDKs and IDEs that developers use to develop Windows apps. They write the software that the system admins run on the servers. They write the security policy management systems that most companies use to manage their users, applications and hardware. And they also write the most popular desktop applications so they can show people how to <i>really</i> implement something like this.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone other than Microsoft can realistically do this. Which is exactly why Microsoft should; it&#x27;s a product that nobody could copy and they would have a 90% market share on corporate BYOD management in under 5 years. Nadella is the right guy to actually push something like that forward; I just hope that the shiny consumer stuff doesn&#x27;t remain a distraction.

I last checked a month or so back and these are the ones I remember off-hand:<p>- Undo/redo is badly broken. If you add an image via ![] there was no undoing beyond that point. Undo was broken in a few other ways too.<p>- Browser spellcheck didn&#x27;t work. This was a big one for me and for anyone who writes a lot.<p>- The preview doesn&#x27;t correctly sync with the markdown editor if you add a bunch of images. This got very frustrating because the auto-sync sometimes rendered the preview-pane useless. I can&#x27;t fathom there isn&#x27;t a manual override until this gets fixed. It forces the writers to contend with a bug (that still exists) each time they edit a post with images.<p>If you build your blogging platform on top of Markdown you should be ready to work within it&#x27;s bounds (you can&#x27;t align images) or let the community write MD extensions (leading to fragmentation and something that will eventually not be MD). Or the third alternative is to have a new flavour (ala GFM) that&#x27;s maintained by the Ghost team itself with very minor modifications. In light of that, I would really propose the following amendments:<p>- Markdown doesn&#x27;t align images. That&#x27;s a severe limitation.<p>- Markdown still sucks at linked images. Try telling a novice to write:<p><pre><code>  [![]()]()\n</code></pre>\nAt least I think that&#x27;s what it is. This is an issue with markdown but I think Ghost should take a few liberties as a favour to the rest of us.<p>- For image alignments, I would propose the following:<p><pre><code>  ![ center aligned ](link)\n  ![left aligned ](link)\n  ![ right aligned](link)\n  ![  right aligned squeezed](link)\n  ![   right aligned squeezed more](link)\n  ...\n</code></pre>\n- And for linked images and images/links in general I would propose:<p><pre><code>    ![](image-link)\n    ![caption](image-link)(href-link)\n    ![caption](image-link)[alt](href-link)\n    !(image-link)(href-link)\n    !(image-link)</code></pre>",1392043638

When I started,I was able to get installed, up-to-speed, and adding new themes, tweaking CSS/HTML, and even PHP pretty quickly.<p>Like many, I got tired of constant upgrades, theme management, bloat, etc. Mostly, I was tired that new Wordpress themes were being developed mainly for marketers.<p>I&#x27;m a writer. I care about my content being seen on its own merit, not whether the theme has SEO capabilities and carousels. So, I decided to donate to Ghost and give it a try when it came out. Competition is always good.<p>I wasn&#x27;t technical when I got started with Wordpress, but I am now. I never had issues installing Wordpress. Installing Ghost a couple months back, however, I just gave up. Let me outline the process from a writer&#x27;s perspective:<p>1. Ooo. Ghost looks so pretty and so clean for my content. I&#x27;d love to have this and get rid of the fifteen different menus there are on Wordpress.<p>2. <i>goes to installation instructions from Ghost team</i> [1].<p>&quot;Running Ghost locally on your computer is straight forward, but requires that you install Node.js first.&quot;  What&#x27;s Node.js, and why do I, as an end-user, care? Ok. It&#x27;s some Javascript thing I&#x27;ve been hearing about. That&#x27;s cool, I guess.  It doesn&#x27;t really matter to me, as long as it looks cool and is easy to write with.  So how do I actually install this thing?<p>3. &quot;I want to install Ghost on:&quot; Mac | Windows | Linux. Huh? I thought this went on my web server somewhere? Like Wordpress does?<p>4. Ah, ok, here we go: &quot;If you&#x27;ve already decided to deploy Ghost to your server or hosting account, that&#x27;s great news! The following documentation will walk you through various options for deploying Ghost, from manual setups, to one-click installers.&quot;<p>5. &quot;Manual Setup&quot; Ok, here we go. &quot;You&#x27;re going to need a hosting package that already has, or will allow you to install Node.js. This means something like a cloud (Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean, Rackspace Cloud), VPS (Webfaction, Dreamhost) or other package that has SSH (terminal) access & will allow you to install Node.js&quot; What? What is all this stuff? How do I know whether my webhost will allow me to install Node.js? Do I need to switch to DigitalOcean?<p>6. I know enough command line to be dangerous, but not sure about all of this stuff. Make Ghost run forever? Why do I have to worry about it stopping running? Is it that different from Wordpress?<p>7. The init script? Is that finally what I have to do to...oh well, forget it. I&#x27;ve already been Googling stuff for 20 minutes to make sure I understand.  This is just too much to take in. I just want to write stuff! Maybe I&#x27;ll try it again when they have a new release out. Back to Wordpress.<p>Ghost has the potential to be good, but it is just way, way too complicated for the average writer to stop using Wordpress, for now. Or, it&#x27;s not complicated, and the set-up instructions are written for developers who want to sometimes write, instead of content-creators who might want to experiment with something new.<p>That should change in time. Technologies always trickle down.<p>But for now,  yes, I still use Wordpress for my blog, and it might be adorable, but for me, I&#x27;m loyal to things that get out of my way and let me do my thing, and Wordpress just does.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.ghost.org/installation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.ghost.org/installation/</a>",1392043331

That&#x27;s not a particularly valid criticism.<p>There are more valid ways of establishing software quality based on bug estimation (defects found, estimated undiscovered defects remaining).  The rate with which init scripts are changed (the fact that they can be modified, possibly erroneously, by individual systems admins is another consideration).  A system that&#x27;s been specifically designed to be resistant to coding and use errors (again:  OpenBSD) is better.

I&#x27;m lost as to why anyone actually still used MtGox over the last 6 months or so.<p>Secondly if you can&#x27;t stomach the swings in Bitcoin, it&#x27;s not the speculatory investment for you.  You need to have a plan and stick to it.  Buy and hold for 5 years is a reasonable plan.<p>I&#x27;m sorry if this isn&#x27;t sympathetic, but you need to learn from your mistake.",1392043149

Two: if you control less than 50% of the hashpower over some time interval, you can with a certain probability and cost alter some rules of the protocol, and the consensus will back you.  For example, there exists no rule amenable to 51% of Bitcoin hashpower currently that says &quot;Transactions to addresses known to be controlled by Patio11 have a special property: they are not allowed on Tuesdays&quot; but you can, in fact, impose that rule on the network without requiring 50% of the hashpower available on Tuesday.

Women&#x27;s achievements, capabilities and potential are seen as much less than men by society. This starts as young as babies even by their own mothers. Successful and competent women are perceived as unlikeable thus less likely to get a raise or rise in the career ladder. Women tend to have less confidence in their ability and thus might contribute to them not asking for a raise.<p>This is mostly due to subconscious cultural influences and socialization of women rather than outright discrimination.<p>Employers are also worried about a women taking maternity leave and being distracted by kids.

Bottom line is I think bitcoin still has a disaster or 2 or 3 ahead of it that&#x27;ll tank the price; only to recover a month or 2 later.  With all this MtGox drama happening + &quot;Russia banning bitcoin&quot;, I&#x27;m poised to move. Also, this list[1] was front-page of HN at one time. If #9 actually happens, combined with a disaster that makes the price tank - say, MtGox shutting down & &quot;USA bans Bitcoin!!&quot;, then I&#x27;d be set.<p>I know my &quot;plan&quot; depends on 2 unlikely events. Probably won&#x27;t happen, but this is bitcoin we&#x27;re talking about. Nobody knows what will happen yet. This is my &quot;plan&quot; based on the craziness I see of bitcoin. Nothing really that special; buy low & sell high. Call me crazy but I say coins still has a few huge swings coming up in 2014. MtGox is already causing one right now. Even if these extremes don&#x27;t happen, I got 1k that I&#x27;m day trading with under smaller swings that I&#x27;ll at least earn back the 2k I&#x27;ve put in so far if not more.<p>1. <a href=""http://lightspeedindia.wordpress.com/2014/01/13/bitcoin-2014-top-10-predictions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lightspeedindia.wordpress.com/2014/01/13/bitcoin-2014...</a><p>Bonus: Reddit is doing a good job of getting people all riled up to cause these big swings... <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1xitx4/im_giving_1_bitcoin_bounty_for_someone_to_draw_up/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1xitx4/im_giving_1_...</a>",1392042672

Even easier if your hoster has CPanel.  Ghost requires either hosting on their systems or your own server running Node.  The latter is not an option for many customers, the majority of bloggers are _not_ web savvy.<p>2) Plugins, themes and knowledgebase, pretty damn good.  However, like any app store there&#x27;s a lot of rubbish and it&#x27;s often hard to tell which plugin you really want.  Not to mention you can make Wordpress do virtually anything you want with the right theme.<p>3) Security.  Wordpress is a mire for this.  I don&#x27;t have a well known blog, but I still got hammered by script kiddies trying to upload malicious files, attempting to access restricted directories, etc.<p>Ultimately this is the problem, Wordpress is a fantastic platform, but it requires constant maintenance to make sure that nothing is insecure.  This is not a problem if you&#x27;re a full time blogger, or you&#x27;re running a profitable website that needs that kind of flexibility.  However, for someone who doesn&#x27;t blog that often and doesn&#x27;t want this overhead, Wordpress is just too much.<p>I now use a static generator (Octopress) because I can&#x27;t be bothered with updating all the time, knowing that if I forget, my site is likely to get hacked.  It was fairly easy to add support for mathtex too.  This plus a hand coded static site for other content is all I need.  I don&#x27;t need any databases, everything is nice and low bandwidth and it&#x27;s trivial to manage everything with git.  Thank god for rake watch!",1392042463

In the browser is like 500 if we were to do things on javascript. Most people fake and call webgl with hard  pre calculations done in a server(native) &quot;web programming&quot;.

It&#x27;s built natively into the OS which allows you to give any UIView on the screen physical properties such as Snap, Gravity, Collision, Attachments, and Pushing.  Those properties, in turn, have settings like friction, density, gravitational pull, damping, elasticity, etc... The idea behind it was to make it so that you could create game style physics mechanics in any iOS application.<p>One example is the iOS7 notification center; If you drag it down and &quot;slam&quot; it to the bottom of the screen, it has some bounce.  A second example is the Messages chats when scrolling quickly; You&#x27;ll notice that as the swipe seed increases you get more space between peoples chat comments and they kind of slam together when you stop scrolling.<p>What I aimed to do here is take that same engine and use it to build FlappyBlock.  So instead of having a loop that says:<p><pre><code>    while () {                // Pipe is not on the left\n      movePipeOnePixelLeft(); // Move Pipe one pixel over\n      if (at the left) break; // If we hit the left, end loop\n    }\n</code></pre>\nPhysics would say something like this:<p><pre><code>    givePipeMassAndLocation();     // Give Pipe physical properties\n    pushPipeLeftWithForceVector(); // Push pipe to left with force\n    whenPipeHitsLeftWallRemove();  // Remove the pipe when it his the left\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s a different way of attacking the same problem using features many newer developers are not familiar with in iOS7.",1392041389

7211060,comment,7210143,7210274,3,0,camus2,,,">   I love Sublime etc. for what it does best, which is editing text, but i still use IDEs for most of my coding so i dont have to think about configuring my editor all day.<p>Because Vim ,Emacs or Sublime are easy to extend or hack. Try to extend VisualStudio or any Jetbrain IDE...<p>Because lightweight editors can open huge files without issues,try to open a 10 mo data/sql file in VS ... no problem with ST or VIM.<p>Because they run on older hardware.<p>Now you say some plugins are outdated , but it&#x27;s easier to fix 20 lines of python than a C# or java project.<p>To sum up,if I want a new feature in ST or Vim I can code it myself quickly,I dont need to wait/pay for a new version of the editor.",1392040885
