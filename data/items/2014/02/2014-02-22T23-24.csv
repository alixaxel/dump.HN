But I don&#x27;t exactly <i>like</i> them either.<p>They&#x27;ve made some pretty piss poor decisions over the last 10 years that have had some huge impacts. IE6 was bad, but I can forgive their ignorance on that — no-one knew any better at the time.<p>What I can&#x27;t forgive is IE8, and the years since then that they&#x27;ve CONTINUED to make major-versioned browsers. If IE6 was a one off problem, it&#x27;d be fine. But with IE7, IE8, IE9, IE10, IE11, and new ones being released all the time, it just seems like MS don&#x27;t realise it&#x27;s a problem. No-one should be making browsers that don&#x27;t silently auto-update at least once a month. It&#x27;s physically harmful to the web ecosystem.<p>I don&#x27;t care how good IE11 is now, whether they&#x27;ve caught up or not, I care about them putting a system in place that ensures everyone always has the latest web technology. Don&#x27;t tell me it&#x27;s not possible. Google and Mozilla have had it sussed for years now. (Apple could do with sorting themselves out on this too. Could also see them go in this direction since Blink split off.)<p>I can&#x27;t help but think the version numbers are political? Some group in Microsoft trying to prove its worth by making a big deal about version numbers every year? &quot;Look how much we care about the web, look at our new shiny browser. It goes to 11...&quot;<p>The web would be way further ahead if Microsoft had stopped making browsers years ago. Millions of hours are wasted every year testing websites in dead browsers. Microsoft created this situation, and they&#x27;ve still not adequately addressed it.<p>Put your latest browser on everything you&#x27;ve ever made, stop calling out the major version numbers, release every month or so.

If you hand it an invalid certificate in the first place, it will complain.<p>The issue is one level deeper. When you connect to a server that supports <i>ephemeral</i> key exchange, the parties involved will generate <i>new</i> key pairs on the fly to use for that connection. In order to make sure that the server has the key published in its certificate, the ephemeral public key shown to the client must be signed by the static private key of the certificate and the client MUST verify it.  It is the ephemeral key signature that is not validated, not the signature on the certificate itself.<p>What happens here is that the server gives the client a _valid_ certificate for which it does not own the private key, and in the ephemeral step, it simply generates a key pair without a valid signature.  At no point in the handshake the server is asked to verify its ownership of the private key associated to the certificate it is presenting<p>To summarize, TLS certificate should be valid, but you are never asked to verify you have its private key when the connection used DHE or ECDHE.",1393113206

After crowdfunding, we&#x27;re going to just be giving the basic software away for free and accepting donations instead of having a structured subscription model.<p>At the same time though, we&#x27;ve had massive pull from enterprise customers for consulting to go alongside the tool to help them do really good internal collaboration and culture change to a more distributed leadership model, as well as facilitate constituent and stakeholder collaboration. That&#x27;s been a significant source of income for us.<p>Overall, the commitment to &quot;pay what you can&quot; has been core to our model and our values, and we&#x27;re sticking with it, but we&#x27;re experimenting with interpreting it in different ways.

If you FORCE me to be there and do it, I will cook dinner for you.&quot; Tell a girl, if she asks why explain here you have trouble concentrating alone, joke that maybe she will make it worse but you&#x27;re willing to try, and tell her that it&#x27;s definitely absolutely not a cunning ploy to get a date with her (it&#x27;s not). If she rejects you ask someone else until you have a girl. Then choose a guy for a different subject (not a close friend, high risk of fucking around), and somebody you really don&#x27;t know for another one, and a buddhist for the next, and an atheist, and and and make sure you surround your study-self with as many different styles of living as possible. You will be able to draw inspiration from them. Solitude is what&#x27;s killing you. Your life will mix with theirs and your energy will combine. I&#x27;m not even half joking here; the energy you draw from linking your progress to someone else (&quot;teamplay&quot;) can amaze you.<p>I&#x27;ll be your first contact if you want, no problem.

But there are a lot of problems with how Google does an interview process.<p>The most known problem is recruiter quality. Google&#x27;s recruiters are notoriously non-diligent and screw up in big ways. It&#x27;s not unheard of for eng candidates to be booked with a non-eng interviewer, and vice versa.<p>In any case, here is how it works in practicality:<p>1. You apply for job X and do a phone screen (or two).<p>2. Random people throughout the company who a) have had interview training and b) are (supposedly) related to X will be tapped to interview you, but nobody from the actual team you are applying to is selected to minimize biases.<p>3. Each person interviews you and fills out a form giving feedback. Feedback is qualitative, as well as quant (scale ratings with previous entries exposed to make biases clear).<p>4. Feedback goes to an unbiased committee (again, not related to the hiring team) for a decision. Feedback is permanently saved in case the person applies again.<p>The problem with (2) and (3) is that it sometimes results in an unrealistic process - depending on the prowess of the recruiting coordinator in setting up interviewers. A front-end dev candidate for Shopping might get interviewed by an deep algos person from Search, and tank the interview because the interviewer had higher expectations for the candidate&#x27;s theoretical knowledge.<p>Good interview training alleviates these problems somewhat, but there are still huge gaps.",1393112524

I think it&#x27;s a good idea to promote resources customized for niche communities that might not be targeted by existing mental health nonprofits. I don&#x27;t really have any specific ideas at this time. But my next step is to get an understanding of everything that is currently available and figure out something from there (whether it be with something that already exists or start something new).",1393111388
