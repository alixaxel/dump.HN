7311841,comment,7311297,7311297,23,0,primitivesuave,,,"I figured out freelancing somewhat organically, around the end of my first year of college, while getting a haircut. The guy giving me the haircut turned out to be the store owner, and we talked for a bit about how you can host your business phone in the cloud. A couple days later I had a simple Java applet making API calls to Twilio (it was my first year of college, I didn&#x27;t know better ways to do it back then). He loved it - he could set it to remind his repeat customers to come in for a haircut at the frequency of their choosing.<p>My favorite thing about that project is how simple it was and how little time it took. For a shitty Java UI that improved his ability to do business, I got a couple hundred bucks and free haircuts for life.<p>After that, whenever I walked into a pizza place or burrito place or whatever, I asked the store owner if there&#x27;s any way I can help them improve their efficiency or web presence. In my head it felt like I&#x27;d get a resounding &quot;fuck off&quot; from all of them, but in reality small business owners are wonderful people who love talking about how to improve their business. Small business owners who are hostile towards random people asking them stuff usually don&#x27;t stay in business for very long.<p>By the end of college, there were three places I could go to get a free pizza, and I hadn&#x27;t paid for a haircut in three years. By the way, one of those pizza store owners had a cousin who worked in a small private lending company. I set up a Python library for him to scrape data from this ancient silo of data and graph it - that was the first job that paid really well.<p>The key is to realize that being a good designer and engineer is like being a superhero in today&#x27;s world.

7311835,comment,7311297,7311498,10,0,rmcastil,,,"> 3 weeks without a paycheck isn&#x27;t exceptional in freelancing, at all.<p>I agree 100% with everything patio11 had to say. There is real fear involved when you have these low periods. Just because you&#x27;re overwhelmed with work now doesn&#x27;t mean you will be four months from now. But you should definitely celebrate the fact that you&#x27;ve proved to yourself you can get clients to pay you!<p>I don&#x27;t think your only options are to quit your job ASAP or wait for 6 months. Instead what I&#x27;d suggest is redirecting all your extra freelancing income to a savings account (bonus points if its an account opened up for your business). Save enough to make yourself feel comfortable with the idea of a contract potentially dropping out of nowhere and not being able to find work for three weeks.<p>Once you hit that amount in savings reevaluate. Are you still getting enough work? Are your past clients going to give you great word of mouth referrals (which is one way to switch off of Elance)?<p>The big thing is you don&#x27;t want your emotions to control your business decisions. I actually wrote a whole blog post on &#x27;How Savings Impact Freelancing&#x27; <a href=""http://challengeacceptedhq.com/how-savings-impact-freelancing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://challengeacceptedhq.com/how-savings-impact-freelancin...</a><p>Good luck and congratulations!",1393505752

For example it also recommends omitting optional tags for the same reason.  I&#x27;m really skeptical that omitting these things helps readability (if that&#x27;s what the guide is referring to when it says &quot;scannability&quot;).  If size is at such a premium why not simply preprocess and minify HTML?  Recently I tried briefly omitting &quot;/>&quot; from <br> and friends and I wasn&#x27;t impressed as far as legibility goes.

7311700,comment,7296759,7297069,1,0,vijucat,,,"> Most people can understand government fiscal policy (to a useful extent anyway). Very few can understand an algorithm even when it&#x27;s explained to them. They vote in the government and currency in it&#x27;s current form (e.g. USD) has worked for generations. Trusting the government seems much safer.<p>Do you know what people trust more than anything else? Other people. Trust in government <i>feels</i> so fundamental, but actually it is based on the fact that OTHER people trust the government, too. People trust a lot many things they don&#x27;t understand, too. People trust https, for example. They feel safe because &quot;everybody else is trusting it, too&quot;.<p>IMHO, this kind of normative ethics (&quot;it is correct because everyone else says so&quot;) is why many societies have totally acceptable behaviours which are obviously wrong to outsiders : whipping women if they dare to drive in Saudi Arabia, ignoring abject poverty as it stares you in the eye in India (or even the West), punishing non-religious or sexually &quot;deviant&quot;, etc;<p>Coming back to BitCoin : the burgeoning community that believes in BTC has the potential to reach critical mass and create the kind of numbers that will serve as a foundation for the kind of trust that the government, for example, or religion (despite being provably nonsensical), enjoys today.<p>TL;DR : it&#x27;s not that people trust the government, they trust what other people trust. A good enough number of people trust BitCoin.",1393502609
