7296870,comment,7293875,7293875,1,0,rufusjones,,,"There&#x27;s no such thing as a &quot;student developer&quot;. If they pay you, you&#x27;re a pro. There are only good and bad pros. Get into the habit, right now, of thinking and acting like a consultant running your own business. If they&#x27;re paying you money, they expect you to behave like a pro.<p>Setting a bill rate is the third most important skill a consultant can have. (#1 is ability to do work, #2 is ability to promote yourself). You have four goals:<p>1. To work steadily enough to make a good living, but not get overwhelmed by assignments.<p>2. To build a base of clients you enjoy working for-- who do not cheat you or drive you crazy.<p>3. To do interesting work that you enjoy, which also builds your skills.<p>4. To make the world a better place or become famous.<p>You use those factors to modify your standard bill rate. If you want the project, you reduce it. If you don&#x27;t want it, you bump the rate.<p>Since I don&#x27;t know WHERE you are (how much competition you have, or how much local businesses expect to pay), it&#x27;s silly for me to give you a figure. SF or NYC means you charge one rate; Nashville or Pittsburgh means another.<p>A simple way to get a feel on the local market is to call up the 2-3 biggest body shops (technical temp agencies) in the area, say you&#x27;re a project manager for a big local firm that wishes to remain confidential (so they&#x27;re not overwhelmed with unsolicited offers) and are looking for 2-3 iOS developers-- a senior guy, an entry-level and a decent worker. Ask what the current rates are.<p>In less than an hour, you&#x27;ll have enough information to give you local market rate-- low to high end. (This is not &quot;dishonesty&quot;-- it is &quot;growth hacking&quot; for your company.)<p>Your line when asked will be &quot;It depends on the project. My rates run between [entry-level] to [high-end], but it depends on what the project is and how much time you want. If you&#x27;re looking for a ballpark, let&#x27;s say [average].&quot;<p>Nine times out of 10, the client already has a budget and just wants some idea of whether you fit in it.<p>Some people will say &quot;Great!&quot;-- which means they&#x27;re willing to pay you the midpoint you gave them.<p>Some will say &quot;Well I can only pay you $$$$&quot; (a dollar amount, not a rate). Now you know the budget and can immediately say &quot;Tell me about the project&quot; (so you can cost it and see if you can do it for a decent rate).<p>Big places will usually tell you what their standard rate is.<p>And when someone immediately begins haggling about money, run. You don&#x27;t want them.<p>Once you have that, you use the following rules:<p>1. NEVER ever EVER do fixed-price jobs. The minute you do rework, you lose. Find out what the project is and figure out, based on your time estimate, if you can get a reasonable rate for that. If so take it. Otherwise, pass.<p>2. Discount for projects that require large blocks of time. 8-hour projects are hard to schedule and they often require as much pre-sale time and hand-holding as 40 or 500-hour projects. That&#x27;s time you&#x27;re not billing or learning, so give then no breaks.<p>3. Discount if the name of the company sounds like someone you&#x27;d want as a client or in a portfolio. (Not too much-- big places expect to pay market rate.)<p>4. Discount if the task sounds fun or like a good learning experience (if it&#x27;s a learning experience, you charge less because you assume you&#x27;ll blow stuff).<p>5. If you&#x27;ve you&#x27;ve heard bad things about the company or you don&#x27;t really want the work, sock em.<p>Some of the other advice here is pretty good, but these are the basics that will take you through a career.",1393325975

Deadlines here mean delivering the packets in time for the next simulation timestep.<p>> Yeah, that’s what happens in most RTS, if the feedback for the action you sent doesn’t come back before Xms, then the game pauses and waits (for example Starcraft 2 does that).<p>To elaborate on this further, I would not consider Starcraft 2 a real time system, because it can stop the world and wait. It is annoying when it starts lagging but produces the &quot;correct&quot; results anyway.<p>This is not the case for simulators that deal with &quot;continuous&quot; physics updates. All clients are simulating the world in parallel and no one has the authority to stop everything. If lag gets significant, the results will become more and more incorrect and the view of the world that the clients have will diverge more. There&#x27;s always some inaccuracy but that is tolerable to some degree.<p>This is by no means the only or necessarily the correct definition of real time but that&#x27;s where I draw the distinction when it comes to multiplayer games.

7296803,comment,7291502,7293605,3,0,antimagic,,,"Just as an FYI, the Enigma decoding effort was not the war-winning codebreak at Bletchley.  Enigma gave access to very tactical, short duration information, like the location of subs and their intended movements over the next few days, or the movement of a land unit, again on a timescale of days.  Admittedly Enigma was so thoroughly broken that the UK was able to decrypt huge numbers of communications, and the aggregate did give some indications as to higher-level strategic planning.<p>Nevertheless, the main game at Bletchley was Colossus (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer</a>) which allowed the decryption of high level planning communications between German High Command and the government.  By main game, I mean that it was the work on Colossus which created the first machines recognisable as computers. This was the codebreak that truly gave the Allies the ability to outmanoeuvre the Germans at a strategic level. There were no German strategic victories once Colossus came on line in late 1943 (the last substantial German victory in the war was <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Kharkov#Manstein.27s_counterattack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Battle_of_Kharkov#Manste...</a> in March 1943), compared to numerous Eastern front victories after the Allies started to successfully decrypt Enigma.<p>Of course we as geeks tend to overestimate the effects of successfully breaking codes.  The results are not always positive - for example Rommel&#x27;s offensive in Africa originally succeeded because Enigma intercepts indicated that he had been told to sit tight, but Rommel decided by himself to launch an offensive.  The English were caught flat-footed, and very nearly lost North Africa as a result (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_campaign#Allies"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_campaign#Allies</a>), with only a well-fought defensive action by the Australians stationed in Tobruk saving the day.",1393325148

The last possibly best exemplified in LWN&#x27;s coverage of a story ... wow, already a decade ago, on LWN:  &quot;Debian and the hot babe problem&quot;.  It concerned an &quot;ITP&quot; (intent to package) a new piece of software.  I&#x27;ll let Jon Corbet take it from here:<p><i>The program involved is hot-babe, a graphical CPU utilization monitor. It works by displaying a typical Bruno Bellamy drawing of a minimally-clad, maximally-endowed woman. As the CPU gets busier (&quot;hotter&quot;), the woman undresses to compensate. Your editor, whose journalistic ethics required that he investigate this utility, found it to be an amusing addition to the desktop - for about five minutes, or until the children walk in, whichever comes first.</i><p><i>The Debian developers raised the obvious, predictable objection to the inclusion of this utility: the associated images were covered by a non-free license.</i><p>Hot babes notwithstanding, one thing I noticed Debian <i>didn&#x27;t</i> have problems with a decade ago were drive-by installs of spyware and adware which were plaguing Windows at the time.  That, um, &quot;ecosystem&quot; has now moved into the mobile space, and the negative equity and goodwill associated will, I suspect, play out in time there as well.",1393325090

7296743,comment,7294487,7296471,3,0,mjn,,,"I can see that narrative with Springer, but the IEEE is a nonprofit, the main professional society for large areas of computer & electrical engineering. It&#x27;s not necessarily the best-run nonprofit, but they aren&#x27;t trying to pump up a stock price or give an ROI to investors or anything. They do need some revenue to pay for their ongoing operations, but in theory they should also be very interested in ensuring that revenue-generating operations don&#x27;t compromise their main mission and reputation (which is the reason to raise revenue in the first place).<p>I think part of it is that historically the IEEE has wanted to be relatively open to new fields of research, so if you have a few professors willing to vouch for a new conference, the IEEE is willing to sponsor it and publish the proceedings. It&#x27;s quite decentralized and any of the various &quot;societies&quot; and &quot;interest groups&quot; within the IEEE can sponsor a conference without central approval... and it&#x27;s also fairly easy to start a new interest group. That system depends on most active IEEE members being legitimate researchers, though, who are in good faith trying to put on real conferences. If that&#x27;s true, it makes sense for the approval policy to be relatively permissive. But some people have been taking advantage of this and producing vanity conferences, so this system probably needs to be tightened. Either the IEEE needs to exercise more control over conference approval, or they need to be more diligent in kicking out people who abuse the trust of the permissive system. The ACM (the main professional society for computer scientists) is somewhat more conservative about sponsoring new conferences, though that does occasionally produce the opposite problem where it takes a lot of legwork (and sometimes politicking) to get a new one accepted.",1393323965

From what I&#x27;ve observed and from the private conversations I&#x27;ve had with people who&#x27;ve had first-hand dealings with them, many of the current batch of hot Bitcoin startups are run by people who don&#x27;t have a fucking clue but have managed to delude themselves that they can build the Next Big Thing in financial technology by faking it &#x27;til they make it. It&#x27;s like a bunch of kids acting at being grown-ups - maybe one or two might actually blunder their way to success but the vast majority are going to crash and burn due to stupid, idiotic mistakes that could have been avoided had they been willing to listen to advice from people with more knowledge and experience. Of course, the downside of actually doing things properly is that they don&#x27;t get the growth/traction that attracts investors&#x27; attention. The corrollary is that the startups who <i>do</i> achieve the sort of growth curves that attract investors probably aren&#x27;t doing things properly, whether by cutting corners, failing to balance the books properly, not focusing enough on security or the 101 other things that can lead to an implosion/collapse/insolvency.<p>While the founders at least have the excuse of being young and foolish, I question the morals of investors who fund teams that clearly lack the appropriate skills/experience to provide proper financial products and services.<p>It&#x27;s the same type of one-way bet that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. If the startup is successful, the founders and investors exit for millions/billions. If it fails, the founders and investors get to walk away unscathed while the customers end up suffering the losses of the founders&#x27; incompetence and the investors&#x27; failure to properly supervise their investment.<p>I fully expect a Silicon Valley-based Bitcoin startup to implode at some point and I would not be at all surprised if the resulting clamour from customers who&#x27;ve lost money is loud enough that the authorities step in to begin regulating the space.",1393323956

The parts of NCD which are exposed are basically:<p>- Integrated DHCP client (runs in the same process, as root).

The Pi has an early pre-release version of version 10, whereas Mathematica is currently on version 9, and there are a number of additional features which will presumably be included in the release of Mathematica version 10.<p>Leaving aside the re-branding issues, it makes some sense for the language to have a separate name, because Wolfram intends for it to be used in web browsers and other places where there is no surrounding development environment (the Mathematica notebook and &#x27;front end&#x27;).",1393322828
