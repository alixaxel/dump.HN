While the code itself can be made predictable, and easy to reason around, the time estimates and project planning often cannot. There is never enough time to factor out all of the commonality, remove all of the unnecessary use of state, codify all the assumptions into data types, etc., so you have to pick your battles.<p>A programmer needs intuition of what the biggest, most effective improvements are on the code base, which allow them to get the most work done.

Because JavaScript the language is so bare-bones, you need to supplement language deficiencies with frameworks and libraries. So you go and pick from a menu of Backbone/Marionette, Angular, ExtJS, Ember, Kendo, jQuery or etc. - some of them work together, some of them don&#x27;t. Most of those get you part of the way there, you may still need to pull in things like require.js to manage imports. Or, instead of raw JS, you go with TypedScript, or Dart, or CoffeeScript, or whatever, and then put a framework on top of those. You&#x27;re still not done, because that gets you the JS part, usually you complement it with a CSS framework (like bootstrap) and a SASS framework.

When you&#x27;re uncompromising about quality, you require yourself to throw out, to waste, things that are of lesser quality.<p>Second of all, beginner, poorly trained, and dispassionate employees are never going to produce beautiful furniture. Mostly because of the above: they either lack the ability or the caring to have the attention to detail necessary to do great work.<p>And the best carpenters aren&#x27;t going to come work for <i>you</i> unless you&#x27;re willing to make it worth their time. Coming to work for <i>you</i> means they will have to do a lot more work in a much less comfortable environment than they are used to. Because the best carpenters have their own shop, their own tools, and work on their own time, because they love it. Going anywhere that is not their own setup is automatically worse for them.<p>It&#x27;s the same thing in software: great software takes patience, it takes time, and it takes money to convince the best programmers that they should be spending their time on you rather than on themselves.<p>But at no point does any of that mean that, because Tool X can&#x27;t magically turn your mediocre working into a stellar one, that means that Tool X is not worth studying. That is completely, 100% backwards. The master practitioner studies <i>all tools</i>, even the ones he or she doesn&#x27;t like, at the very least to understand what is wrong with them and why they don&#x27;t produce the results they want. A master carpenter might prefer a hand saw over an electric one because the electric saw chips the corners of the board too easily, or something. But he doesn&#x27;t know that unless he&#x27;s studied the electric saw.<p>You can&#x27;t have &quot;an absence of methodology&quot; any more than a wood shop can have &quot;an absence of tools&quot;.

Some, such as TDD, work to address the rapid building of tools to a particular spec, but often fail to promote static guarantees, especially in languages and environments where such provability is largely impossible.  Dynamic languages penchant for monkey (guerrilla) patching further exacerbates the problem.<p>Solutions to this are tough.  My first suggestion would be to use languages which facilitate correctness, although it&#x27;s usually at the expense of developer availability: the pool of engineers with experience and know-how in true FP is orders of magnitude smaller than more pervasive languages.  My second thought is to further embrace math as the building block for non-trivial applications: mathematical proofs have real, quantifiable value in correctness.  I find it no surprise that the larger companies have made foundational maths, such as category theory and abstract algebra, the underlying abstraction for their general frameworks.  This is even a tougher pitch than the first since most engineers don&#x27;t recognize what they&#x27;re doing as math at all - a big part of the problem.  So many of us are doing by feel what has already been formally codified in other disciplines.<p>I&#x27;m aware that both require more (not necessarily formal) education than most engineers have pursued and makes it a difficult short-term pitch point for any company, but I think if we&#x27;re serious about eliminating sources non-determinism from projects, it&#x27;s important we address them directly.",1392050250

At work, I have a computer that is from Q1 2009. It has an Intel dual core (pre &quot;core i&quot;) CPU and 2 GB ram, and is running some kind of ancient Scientific Linux (based on CentOS). I also have some code on computers standing on the other side of the atlantic, into which I have to ssh, and then use vi over the net, which is horrible. My portable is a trusty old eeePC that, while great for writing/coding on the go, and doing office stuff, is really painful to use with a modern IDE.<p>That sucks of course, but it&#x27;s not going to change soon since I&#x27;m a scientist, not a programmer (although I mainly program). And it&#x27;s not just my university, but apparently a common problem in my field. The crappy state of PCs doesn&#x27;t affect the runtime of our programs though. We&#x27;re supposed to run most code on the Grid or on batch systems anyway, which usually have plenty of power. But it&#x27;s really a problem for productivity, and I wonder what I would be able to do if we had similar resources like industrial programmers.<p>Btw. at home I have a desktop PC that I bought for gaming some time ago (Intel i5 2500, 8 GB ram, decent GPU, Hackintosh/Win7), and I find myself more and more bringing work home to run on it, because it outperforms anything I have in the lab.

7211869,comment,7206637,7207720,1,0,briandon,,,"[continued from previous reply]<p>(4B.) The next day was uneventful. You were silently thankful that the delivery guy didn&#x27;t call you while you were at work and pointlessly try to browbeat you into agreeing to an afternoon delivery. When you got home at 6PM, after changing out of your work clothes and freshening up, you began the prep work for your chili. You set your phone on the kitchen counter next to you while you de-seeded and de-ribbed the bell peppers, chopped them and the onions, and minced the garlic. When that was done, since you were already in the kitchen, you wiped down the counters and range and tidied things up. At 7:30, you phoned the supermarket and asked them where your stuff was. The manager apologized and promised to phone you back. At 7:50, he called and apologized some more. There was a mixup and your order never made it onto the delivery truck. But he assures you that they&#x27;ll deliver everything tomorrow.<p>You&#x27;d already chopped the vegetables. And, luckily, you had eggs and cheese. You made a frittata. The next day, you went back to the supermarket and bought more onions and bell peppers. You bought more beef too, since the pack you&#x27;d bought two days earlier had passed its use-by date.<p>(5.) Why would you visit a grocery store? Jeez what year is it. Of course, you shopped online, at the supermarket website, paid by credit card, and everything was delivered hassle-free three days later from the supermarket chain&#x27;s warehouse, located some miles away. Well, it was almost hassle-free. The delivery person did haggle over the time -- they wanted to deliver everything at 2PM and it took you a while to make them understand that there would be nobody at home until 6PM. And then, though, he had agreed to deliver between 6PM and 7PM, he didn&#x27;t actually show up until 8PM.<p>After tipping the delivery person and cutting open the taped-shut cardboard boxes containing your purchases, you were a bit aggravated to find that they had charged you for two cartons of Brand X organic, free range eggs ... but delivered two cartons of (cheaper) Brand Y eggs. Also, some of the vegetables had seen better days. No matter. The former was an honest mistake and the latter was a small price to pay for convenience you knew that you could cut out the iffy bits of the vegetables before using them. You put the eggs in the fridge, after calling the supermarket and being shuffled from one employee to another to get them to agree that you could exchange the wrong eggs for the ones that you had paid for at your local branch the next evening, provided that you could show them the printout of your order confirmation email.  Then, you briskly began the task of cutting up the now-empty cardboard boxes and folding and stacking the pieces so that you could get them into a bag or so that you could get rubber bands around them ... for the trip downstairs to the cardboard recycling bin. It was nearly nine by the time that you got back into your apartment and slipped off your sneakers to sweep up the slivers of cardboard and little bits of flotsam and jetsam (dried bits of banana-something from the banana boxes and wispy little feathers that had been inside the boxes that had held cartons of eggs before being reused by the supermarket) that ended up on your kitchen floor while you were unloading and then cutting up and packing the cardboard.<p>Except for permutation #1 (I haven&#x27;t seen supermarkets using paper bags here, possibly because of the condensation issue), we have experienced each of these scenarios, numerous times.<p>I didn&#x27;t even touch on what it&#x27;s like to be walking home from the supermarket, in the open, and getting caught in a sudden downpour. Even if you are carrying a tiny collapsible umbrella, it&#x27;s a neat trick to use it if you&#x27;re carrying more than a tiny amount of stuff since holding an umbrella with one hand entails carrying everything else with the remaining hand. Fun times.<p>I didn&#x27;t take up the question of multiple stops/errands, either. Without a vehicle to hold stuff in between stops and to get you from one stop to another faster, everything takes much, much longer to accomplish and the planning outings becomes much more than a matter of leaving the supermarket stop for last so that your ice cream won&#x27;t melt. You&#x27;ve got to juggle your guesstimates as to the weights of the stuff you&#x27;ll be picking up or dropping off at each stop, the form factors of the packages they&#x27;ll be in, and (for those establishments where you&#x27;ll be making purchases and which offer delivery) their delivery times and your past experiences with the reliability of their delivery personnel.",1392049625

Since you&#x27;re at the supermarket, you also bought the other things that you needed: a bottle of shampoo, some toilet tissue, a lightbulb(it would be slightly cheaper to get a 6-pack of bulbs but you only need one right now and don&#x27;t want to carry anything absolutely unnecessary home) like, a couple of cartons of milk, some coffee or tea, a carton or two of eggs, some chicken breasts, more vegetables, etc. At the checkout, you bagged your own purchases or had them bagged for you and began the five-to-ten-minute walk home.<p>(1.) Unfortunately, it was warm out and the cartons of milk sweated and the condensation soaked through that bag (the supermarket uses eco-friendly, recyclable paper bags) and the bottom tore out and everything from that bag fell onto the sidewalk. Time to set your bags on the pavement or the grass next to the sidewalk and try to distribute those items between the remaining bags. The bag holding the ground beef and chicken breasts is looking a bit iffy too, but it&#x27;ll probably hold (fingers crossed!) until you get home. The milk cartons have warmed up a bit and hopefully won&#x27;t sweat enough to take the bag(s) into which you&#x27;ve placed them before you get home.<p>(2.) Wait. Suppose that you opted for the (biodegradable) plastic bags. Condensation wouldn&#x27;t affect them. As you were walking home, however, one of the corners of one of the milk cartons, with the help of gravity and the movements to which the bag containing the milk was subjected as you walked home, made a whole in the bottom of the bag, with the same result as if you had been using paper bags.<p>(3.) OK, so you wisely double-bagged (in plastic) your groceries and you made it home without any bags failing. Unfortunately, something in the bag with the carton(s) of eggs shifted while you were humping the bags home and a coupel of the eggs broke, making a bit of a mess in the bag.<p>(4.) No, of course you wouldn&#x27;t haul all of your groceries home at once. That&#x27;s sheer madness. You only took the perishable items and left the rest to be delivered. That meant an extra few minutes spent at the checkout, at the head of a long line of people, each of whom also had to spend a bit longer in line themselves, giving the store your home address and telephone number and checking with the cashier to find out when your stuff would be delivered (answer: 12PM to 8PM the next day, but the delivery person will phone you first). What&#x27;s a few extra minutes here or there, right? You also aren&#x27;t paranoid, so you have no problem giving the store your home address and phone number and don&#x27;t care whether or not the company owning the supermarket aggregates your purchases with your name, address, and phone number and resells the information to marketers. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for the convenience of not having to lug all of your stuff home yourself.<p>Not having all of the ingredients for chili (the cans of beans and jars of tomato sauce are amongst those purchases that were to be delivered), you had something else for dinner instead. You weren&#x27;t planning to make chili that night anyway, since you took the delivery delay into account when you made your grocery list.<p>The next day, the delivery guy called you a few times while you were in a meeting and couldn&#x27;t answer your phone. Jeez, his last message sure sounded irate. He was still annoyed with you when you phoned him back and even more annoyed when you told him that nobody would be home to take delivery until at least 6PM. The earlier he can finish his deliveries, the sooner he can get home and spend time with his own family.<p>When you got home, at 6 PM, he was waiting for you in the hallway outside your apartment door with your stuff packed in half a dozen repurposed cardboard boxes (from the labels printed on the boxes, you can tell that some of them had held bananas and others had held cartons of eggs) stacked on a little cart. Cardboard is better than plastic (even the biodegradable plastic used in the supermarket&#x27;s bags), so that was good.  Unfortunately, after you transferred the boxes inside your apartment, tipped the delivery guy, and began unpacking the items you had purchased the day before, you discovered that the shampoo had been packed upside down and half its contents had slowly leaked out. It only took a few minutes to wash the shampoo off the cans of beans. No big deal. And you can always get another bottle of shampoo when you go back to the store. Maybe you ought to tighten the top of the bottle a bit before going to the checkout next time, just in case, or carry it home. Carrying a bit more weight will just help build up the muscles in your arms and shoulders, right? As a matter of fact, your shoulders were a bit sore from carrying the perishables home yesterday. Feel the burn, baby!<p>[to be continued]",1392049549

We love to think we are, but most of us are very emotionally driven.   Our emotion comes into play when it comes to drive, motivation, hard work, creativity, and organization.   Creating software requires motivation, creativity, organization, etc.    Our emotion is behind software and we simply try to manage it with software development methodologies, but that&#x27;s not enough.<p>How many people are over weight, who know that all you have to do is eat less, work out and then you will get in shape?  It&#x27;s that simple. Yet because of emotions, eating due to emotion, happy eating, sad eating, or poor self image many people don&#x27;t get in shape.  Likewise many students understand that all you have to do to get great grades is to avoid procrastinating, just start studying on time, study hard, study more, do most of the exercises in your text book, use multiple books and you are most likely to pass with high grades, yet lots of students put it off, poor will power, delayed gratification, it&#x27;s more fun to goof off.<p>Same things apply to software, a lot of us know exactly what it takes to make good software, to spec it out, to plan a good architecture, to write good test units, to comment and document the code, to organize the process, to avoid over optimization, to avoid changing and adding lots of new features in the middle.<p>Yet, a lot of us don&#x27;t do that, we start writing code before we even code before we spec out, because its exciting!  Our emotions in play, we don&#x27;t practice that delayed gratification of holding off and writing specs.   We plan to throw away this prototype, but then somehow, it ends up being what everything is built on.    We plan to refactor one day, but feature creep never allows for that.   We know we ought to comment, but we understand the code now and don&#x27;t, then 6 months later we are cussing and kicking the wall.   Test units are boring, so we write as little of it as possible.<p>Until we take into account that programmers are humans, with emotions and different level of discipline, motivations and abilities our software development methodologies will keep to fail us for most projects.<p>Just my opinion.",1392049468

The nearlynet strategy is to start with a service that is lousy but cheap, and to make it better. The permanet strategy assumes that quality is the key driver of a new service, and permanet has the advantage of being good at every iteration. Nearlynet assumes that cheapness is the essential characteristic, and that users will forgo quality for a sufficient break in price.</i><p><i>What the permanet people have going for them is that good vs. lousy is not a hard choice to make, and if things stayed that way, permanet would win every time. What they have going against them, however, is incentive. The operator of a cheap but lousy service has more incentive to improve quality than the operator of a good but expensive service does to cut prices. And incremental improvements to quality can produce disproportionate returns on investment when a cheap but lousy service becomes cheap but adequate. The good enough is the enemy of the good, giving an edge over time to systems that produce partial results when partially implemented.</i><p>The people on the web platform have much greater motivation to improve perf and the developer experience than the people working on native platforms have to expand distribution.",1392048591

It seems rather woolly compared to say, Marxism.  Capitalism seems to me to be something we have been doing for tens of thousands of years.  Saying &quot;no capitalism is what Marx said it was so that he had something to be against&quot; is kind of backwards.  (that may not be what you are saying, but its what I got from the article)<p>To my mind the biggest difference between capitalism and communism (as practised) has been the use of price as a signalling mechanism (see the way China moved away from a centrally planned model).<p>Otherwise capitalism seems to have covered a vast vast range of practises over centuries, but perhaps can be boiled down to <i>trade</i> or <i>trade with price as a signalling mechanism</i>.<p>If this &quot;definition&quot; of capitalism is right, then it seems that it gets fixed often.<p>BTW, I am in favour of massive change, including the dunking of captains, the fundamentals of our society are creaking and there is a new approach needed.  Its just that the next workable approach is not an approach anyone has so far tried, and probably not thought of, (although much more open transparent decision making and information is almost certainly going to be involved thanks to the Internet).<p>So chucking Ahab overboard when we do not know what course to set after is a bad idea, but chucking him overboard if he threatens to sink the ship is a good idea.  We are just disagreeing on whether this current bout of mad behaviour (whatever it may be) is a threat to the ship or not.<p>Thank for the reply anyway.",1392048309

A verification key, which is stored on another device or offline, can be used to calculate the sealing key for any given moment.
