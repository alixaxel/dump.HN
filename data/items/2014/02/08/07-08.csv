7200647,comment,7200280,7200595,2,0,lutusp,,,"> To be fair, thats like asking you to explain why gravity works. (without saying that it just does) There are a lot of things that seem simple which smart people have only theorized.<p>Be careful when you say &quot;only theorized.&quot; A well-supported scientific theory is the highest form of human knowledge. A scientific theory isn&#x27;t just a hunch (the everyday meaning of theory), it&#x27;s a combination of observational evidence, a careful explanation of the evidence, and some predictions based on the explanation that can be researched to expand the domain of the theory. And (very important) a basis for falsifying the theory, an observation that would prove the theory false.<p>The recent discovery of the Higgs boson is an example of theory confirmation -- it&#x27;s based on the &quot;standard model&quot;, the theoretical structure of modern physics, and the Higgs was predicted on theoretical grounds long before we had any chance to detect it.<p>As to &quot;smart people only theorized&quot;, gravity has an explanation, and a very good one -- general relativity. Relativity is one of the two best-confirmed scientific theories we have (the other one is quantum theory, that makes our computers possible).<p>Please remember this when you want to say &quot;only a theory&quot;.",1391846367

For example, look at how Taoism fits in neatly with a lot of folk religion that predates its arrival in the area. Similar examples can be found for most (all?) major religions.<p>* Political fortune.

7200632,comment,7200280,7200467,2,0,yew,,,"I agree that formal debates over evolution are counterproductive - they give the impression that evolution and creationism should be taken equally seriously, and anyway they&#x27;re more about who&#x27;s a better presenter than who has the better evidence.<p>I appreciate Dawkins&#x27; writing, though. If nothing else, it contributed significantly to my shift away from evangelical fundamentalism. One of the benefits of Dawkins&#x27; choice of material is that it can communicate new ideas to the very religious (not &quot;always does&quot; but &quot;has the capacity to&quot;), whereas arguments about historical accuracy or studies of religious behaviour can&#x27;t - because, from a fundamentalist perspective, that sort of evidence is necessarily secondary to communication directly from God.<p>For me, Dawkins first presented the idea that it might be <i>possible</i> for evidence to be more meaningful than faith, that everyone who wasn&#x27;t a fundamentalist might <i>not</i> be lying or deceived. I consider that a justification for his work, though perhaps I&#x27;m wrong about its effectiveness (though I was a fairly strong believer when I read it). I don&#x27;t know on what criteria you&#x27;re basing your own judgement.<p>(Of course, I&#x27;m speaking here from my own experience and observation just of the community where I grew up.

7200625,comment,7200280,7200600,5,0,lutusp,,,"> Why are certain religions much more successful than others?<p>Evolution. I know this sounds like a punch line for a joke, but consider that a religion&#x27;s doctrinal choices represent natural selection -- some choices are more effective than others, and a dominant religion in a world of competing religions equals a dominant species in a world of competing species -- the same rules apply.<p>And what are the successful species traits? One, a reverence for authority, a time-tested way to attract and hold people who cannot think for themselves. Two, a prohibition against having sex without the intent to breed more miniature believers, a prohibition that the Catholics have raised to an art form. Three, a prohibition against independent thought or constructive criticism, in which the masses are described as a flock of sheep, and they eat it up.<p>The great irony is that many religions (not all by any means), while very clearly exploiting the strategy of evolution by natural selection to grow their submissive flocks, reject the very idea of evolution, describe it as an evil idea.",1391845430

Either it&#x27;s turtles all the way down, or you then need to hardcode config information for the second cluster, in which case it serves little purpose.<p>I&#x27;d rather have a mechanism where each peer takes a list of possible peers and tries to connect, with a method for deciding when there is quorum to elect an initial leader and start allowing writes (that&#x27;s easy enough by introducing a config option to decide if a peer is &quot;blessed&quot; to be part of the initial leadership election, and how many blessed peers must be connected to have quorum - just needs to be enough to form a majority of blessed peers to prevent more than one subset from electing a leader before they manage to connect)<p>Am I missing something?",1391845400

7200619,comment,7200280,7200457,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"I&#x27;ve engaged in discussions of various topics over the years and developed a few guidelines and practices which I try to adhere to.  Starting with the &quot;training-wheel&quot; arguments typical of high-school and college age, and evolving through many of technology&#x27;s &quot;religious wars&quot; (vi vs. emacs, Microsoft vs. Linux, etc. -- particularly the latter).<p>Among them:<p>• Go Socratic.  Sometimes the best way to convince someone is to let them argue their own way out of their position.  Ask questions rather than make assertions or pound facts.<p>• Realize that often the game <i>isn&#x27;t</i> to convince.  I have positions I hold strongly, most on the basis of experience, evidence, or logic that&#x27;s convincing to me (and I&#x27;m occasionally persuaded to change my mind).  But in discussing them with others my objective is often to understand what the basis of their position is.  I might learn something.  Fairly often, I&#x27;ll find that the views <i>aren&#x27;t</i> well-founded or aren&#x27;t convincing (strengthening my own conclusions).<p>• Distressingly often your&#x27;ll find that a person&#x27;s primary argument is &quot;it benefits me to claim this belief despite no rational or factual basis for it&quot; -- it&#x27;s Upton Sinclair (and Al Gore)&#x27;s observation:  &quot;It&#x27;s difficult to get a man to understand something if his salary depends upon his not understanding it.&quot;<p>• Rejection of concepts is often driven by fear.  I ran across this passage re-reading Robert Pirsig&#x27;s <i>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</i>:  &quot;You are never dedicated to something you have complete confidence in. No one is fanatically shouting that the sun is going to rise tomorrow. They know it&#x27;s going to rise tomorrow. When people are fanatically dedicated to political or religious faiths or any other kinds of dogmas or goals, it&#x27;s always because these dogmas or goals are in doubt.&quot;<p>• Psychology is a hell of a drug.  There area all sorts of weird aversions people have.  I&#x27;ve met pathological liars.  I&#x27;ve met people who simply deny obvious truths.  Who feel &quot;it&#x27;s not a lie if I simply don&#x27;t say it&quot; (the lie of omission) or &quot;if I only try to draw your attention from it&quot; (lie of distraction).  People are rather less rational than you might hope.<p>And for all of that, I&#x27;ve had some pretty amazing, interesting, and productive exchanges, often in the oddest places.  Pulled into a highway rest area in the deep south a few years back, started talking with another man there.  We both verbally circled for a few minutes trying to suss each other out, then realize that, actually, our views were fairly similar despite the miles that separated us.  That was one of the more interesting 45 minute conversations I&#x27;ve had in years.  Possibly decades.",1391845334

There are several non-standardized Latinesque orthographies we know (see Carochi) for Nahuatl, so it&#x27;s a known phenomenon. (And there&#x27;s still no standard system!) The hand of the Voynich seems reasonably practiced, so it must&#x27;ve had some use, but it could possibly still have been only one man over a few years.

Same sort of thing. If the (theoretical Spanish friar) Voynich author had been less inventive, we&#x27;d (if this theory is true) have long since understood it.<p>Anyway, hopefully a few Meso-American language experts can take a look and decide if there&#x27;s a possible match.",1391845307

7200612,comment,7199040,7200157,21,0,jjcm,,,"My biggest issue a lot of times with &quot;photoshop killers&quot;, is that they rarely tackle non-destructive editing (I believe gimp is included on this, but I haven&#x27;t touched it for about a year now). Many have masking capabilities, but any lighting adjustments to an image or corrections in general are destructive edits (meaning they alter the underlying pixels of the source image). Non destructive edits are extremely important, especially if a client asks for changes later. It&#x27;s much easier to change a slider on an adjustment layer than to undo a ton of your work because you can&#x27;t return the original detail to a picture. When I&#x27;m doing a photomanipulation, I&#x27;ll usually have a minimum of three adjustment layers on a source image, allowing me to fine tune the look I need. In alternatives, I can&#x27;t do that. Once I apply a curve change, I cant tell Krita, &quot;hey remember that curve adjustment I did 14 steps ago?

Updating host files or ssh moduli is about all it seems good for.  In reality, files have to be changed at just the right time in a series of coordinated changes with everything else.  Chef is what I reach for first, because it solves the problem in the most logical and most complete way.  Some people prefer Puppet and that works too.  But it&#x27;s several systems together, like TheForeman (not just Foreman) that make for more powerful infrastructure.  There are half a dozen or so other systems in addition to some homegrown (nonportable) ones out there but most others fail to meet requirements Chef and Puppet address (security, auditing, scalability, non/determinism).<p>Hiera is a like a hierarchal property list that puppet chef etc can use to pull its state.  Use zk as a backend to keep multiple instance of hiera in sync to scale for large shops.  The neat thing is, like OpenLDAP, Hiera has multiple backends to store your single source of truth.  It&#x27;s like if you wanted to run a Heroku, the environment variables for apps would go in there.  Zookeeper is solid but hard to use directly.  A more concrete example is a MySQL cluster: you&#x27;d want to know what are the hostnames and what is the write master.  Sure you could write something that talks to zookeeper but it wouldn&#x27;t be very general purpose.  It&#x27;s for the use case of scaling beyond what Redis can handle and you do want to get tied to any particular technology other than Hiera.  If anyone has funding lying around and wants to take infrastructure smarter and farther, talk to R.I.

It sounds like there&#x27;s <i>some</i> compromise already built into the system. Not to mention the minimum 40 ratings before they require a 4.5.<p>At the end of the day, it&#x27;s a business with specific goals. Some businesses can employ people who only rate a 3.0 and still meet their goals; some can&#x27;t.<p>>you go through a really messy breakup and perform at 50% capacity for six months.<p>Two months in my case (happened once; was going to leave the job in 2-3 months regardless, but it&#x27;s the only job I&#x27;ve ever had that they weren&#x27;t begging me to stay). But you are right that, with my awesome specialized software skill-set, I was able to pick up a new job in just a couple months, and at this point I can practically write my own ticket.<p>If your hypothetical break-up survivor is pissing off customers, though, Uber has <i>no choice</i> but to fire him or her if they want to meet their goals. How else are they going to keep the fleet-wide ratings at or above 4.5 stars, which is likely their goal?<p>Honestly I do wonder where people in, say, the bottom percentile of job or interpersonal skills (or both) can get work. I&#x27;d fully support a &quot;living wage for everyone&quot; concept, at least if it can be shown to work at <i>some</i> scale, to sidestep this problem. Or a government &quot;works&quot; program that guaranteed a job to everyone who wanted one (in conjunction with a disability system, of course, that could provide support to people who didn&#x27;t have the mobility or brain function to perform even menial labor).<p>But how the system works when it&#x27;s working well (i.e., prior to the 1970s [1]) is that there are more jobs than employees, and so the jobs have to make due with who they can find, and/or the jobs have to be attractive enough to get the applicants. It&#x27;s how the programming market is right now: I <i>know</i> that most developers have really basic skills compared to mine (probably only 1 in 20 professional developers that I encounter are even in the same ballpark), but even the least productive developers get great salaries and benefits.<p>And how the system needs to change is that workers need to own the companies they work for. Then their personal motivations line up with that of the company, and employee/owners who have a bad breakup maybe spend six months collecting a lower salary and working part time until they get back on their feet. Or maybe because of their closer support network (employees who own a piece of the action probably will stick around longer -- and care more about their coworkers) they don&#x27;t take six months to get over a break-up.<p>I agree that things need to be fixed. I don&#x27;t agree that a company should be required (morally or otherwise) to shoot itself in the foot to achieve social justice.<p>[1] A long watch, but totally worth it if these questions are of interest to you: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KqeU8nzn4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-KqeU8nzn4</a>",1391842991

The longer you own the car (and the less you drive it), the lower those expenses are.  Parking (including the land or rent you pay to your garage) is another big hidden expense.<p>Automobile reliability has, generally, advanced worlds from where it was in the 1970s.  It used to be that getting 100,000 miles was a significant accomplishment, now it&#x27;s pretty much expected, and having a car run 200,000 miles isn&#x27;t uncommon.  I&#x27;d had a vehicle I ended up selling to a friend which went 280k before it was finally cash-for-clunkered.  In that time, it went through a couple of radiators, a couple of exhaust manifold repairs, and a transmission (protip:  keep &#x27;em lubed and watch for oil leaks).  And a few sets of brake pads, possibly a clutch.  But all told, pretty remarkable.<p>In the 2000s you saw some significant improvements in safety (ubiquitous airbags, ABS, and traction control), but not a whole lot else.<p>That said:  doing a lot of city driving in traffic is fairly high-risk and high-wear on a car.",1391842810
