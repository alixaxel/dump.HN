I don&#x27;t know about that, but compared to what? Even in word it does need some time to reach the &quot;Save as PDF&quot; menu, right?<p>>> &quot;Inconsistent&quot;\n> I&#x27;m not sure what tinco meant by this, but it does in fact return the same results for the same file across multiple runs.<p>Well, there is some truth about this. There is an odd naming scheme if you look at stuff like &quot;enumerate&quot;, &quot;itemize&quot; and &quot;description&quot; - beginners get confused by this as they assume it would be called &quot;describe&quot;. The same goes for most of the packages. This is somehow historical, but I think it also makes it unnecessary hard to figure out LaTex for beginners, right?<p>Also the reason why LaTex needs several runs to finally create the full document. Nowadays you would do this differently I guess as there is simply no need to start the program twice if the application would be smart enough to call sub-programs (like biblatex) by itself on the fly. It would still run the same routine several times, but users wouldn&#x27;t see it and it would be one command for them to build the document. That&#x27;s another point beginners tend to go crazy about :)<p>Having said that, I should add that I&#x27;m using LaTex (and XeLaTex, etc.) daily and there isn&#x27;t a single program matching the power and beauty of it - I even design covers for my publications with it. But I&#x27;m able to use vim and emacs, right? 90% of the people are bloody beginners and it would be a shame to hide the beauty of a LaTex document from them.<p>>> &quot;It&#x27;s syntax is ugly.&quot;<p>Yeah, well...ugly is a bad term to discuss about.

7281454,comment,7278214,7278907,2,0,anon4,,,"> (Yes, it gives me shivers just thinking about how much each of those technologies sucks when you think about how good it all could be.)<p>I can tacitly agree that using vim running in a terminal to write LaTeX is not the easiest way in the world to write LaTeX.<p>However, terminals do not suck. Bash sucks a bit, vim sucks in ways this project aims to fix, but terminals are absolutely awesome.<p>A terminal is a dead-simple API for interacting with the user. Want to display text? Write to fd 1. Want to read some input? Read from fd 0. Want to control the cursor or change the colour? Write a special sequence of characters to fd 1, that&#x27;s supported by every regular terminal emulator. There is even support for getting mouse events. Yes, it&#x27;s text-only but that is enough in a lot of cases. And it&#x27;s very simple. And you get it for free the moment your program starts. There is no opening connections to X, no initialising GUI libraries, no callbacks, no need to design a GUI. It&#x27;s just there. It&#x27;s always there.<p>Try coming up with a GUI system that has an API as simple as that. The only thing I can imagine is something that consumes HTML written to fd 1 and renders it nicely. But note that HTML can and will be malformed, and malformed HTML can and will be parsed differently by different &quot;HTML terminal emulators&quot;. Plus, if you want to do that, just write javascript and stick it in a .html file.",1393058616

It was a scary monopoly, it was pushing crappy APIs, not following standards, perverting them. That legacy crap is still there. It is still maintained. Someone deals with it.

Open source Windows if you want to be open. Open source your browser if you want to be open. Go back and fix your broken APIs and start following standards. Google as much as many don&#x27;t like it (and I am in that camp too, when it comes to privacy), has to be commended for being open and contributing to Open Source.

Because of MS&#x27;s transgressions in the past, you don&#x27;t get the benefit of the doubt from younger devs. Because you&#x27;re still behaving like jerks with patents, younger devs know that the company hasn&#x27;t changed.<p>Microsoft is still extracting software patent royalties from android OEMs this very minute - that&#x27;s not anyone&#x27;s pappy, and it&#x27;s not a vendor overreaching. It&#x27;s a calculated, evil decision by the highest levels of management.",1393056348

You and I have very different ideas of what harm is, then.<p>Of course, in reality it&#x27;s often difficult to <i>prove</i> that a specific outcome was the result of a privacy invasion. It&#x27;s not like insurers or employers are going to document that they discriminated unfairly, whether illegally or otherwise, in making their decisions. But we know all the things I mentioned can happen, partly because too many times there have been cases where real evidence was seen, and partly because in some cases incentives are aligned with poor behaviour and it&#x27;s just plain naive to think it won&#x27;t then happen if there&#x27;s nothing to balance those incentives.<p>Privacy is important because it removes the ability to make those unfair decisions in the first place.",1393056341
7281354,comment,7281283,7281283,5,0,Aoyagi,,,"Ah, the great question of modern times: Should I more hate Microsoft or Google? Personally I&#x27;ll go with Microsoft, because contrary to what the blog says, I feel that Google is far more open, though that still won&#x27;t make me buy and Android device. At least not without instantly &quot;flashing&quot; it with some custom ROM that&#x27;s stripped of as much Google things as possible. Would any Windows version allow me to do this? Of course not, WP doesn&#x27;t even allow me to access the file system.\nAs for Microsoft being aware of anything, it&#x27;s aware of sales and automated feedback. That&#x27;s all. Considering Lumia 520 makes up a third of all Windows Phone sales, I assume there will be a lot of cheap phones in the future and little expensive innovation.\nBoth companies are effectively forcing things on people, so talking about &quot;being open&quot; is, in general, out of the question. And with the &quot;cloud and mobile foremost&quot; direction of Microsoft, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll have to look for &quot;new&quot; reason to hate Microsoft the same as or more than Google.",1393056321
