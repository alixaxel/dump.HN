Havoc ensued when they crossed 2^32 tweets, because lots of software out there ended up being written with the assumption that a tweet ID could fit into a 32-bit integer. It was true for some years, and then suddenly it wasn&#x27;t anymore, and everything broke.",1393034297

I will share a personal experience.<p>Traveling from Luxembourg to Brussels by train I made an arrangement for a room via AirBnB. It being the first time, they asked me for ID, and Credit Card information. I provided that. By the time I got off the train I received a response from AirBnB that my reservation had been canceled due to the fact that I hadn&#x27;t provided a photo of myself for AirBnb. I believe the reason was because they wanted to know that I was a &quot;real person&quot;, but the exact phrasing escapes me. This was not the case since I provided a photo of my driver&#x27;s license as my ID. As a result I had to scramble to find a room in one of the most expensive cities in the world for this at the last moment (which was expensive).<p>I strongly disagree with the idea that &quot;your face&quot; should be integrated with a purchase. I strongly agree that your identity which includes but should not be limited to a subset of &quot;your face&quot; should.<p>If you are proceeding down this path I recommend having a user select a photo, rather than taking a self portrait.<p>Good Luck.",1393033713

But a distributed system is usually defined in the second meaning of what you said inside the search engine, instead of across different websites.<p>I&#x27;m very interested in this topic because I&#x27;ve proposed my solution for how to improve search engines, not from algorithm point of view, but from systematic point of view. And making it fully distributed is the key.<p>While you mentioned about the 2-level search and &quot;receiving their algorithms and data ...&quot;, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very feasible. Do you agree? So vertical distributed architecture across various industries is not a feasible solution. But we can do a horizontal distributed architecture which will collect data from geographic locations. In each location, there will be many different verticals.

7280627,comment,7279262,7279996,11,0,mbell,,,"> The smartest kids I knew were those with very intellectual, but hands off, parents.<p>Parents are one part of it, but teachers are another. I grew up in a very rural but fairly rich community, not because the people were rich (quite the opposite actually), rather because there was a nuclear power plant in town that paid 98% of the towns taxes.<p>I don&#x27;t remember the exact prompt but I do recall writing a paper for 10th grade english class about quarks.  My english teacher went and talked to one of our science teachers because she thought I made up the entire thing, she didn&#x27;t think quarks were real.<p>That in itself is fine, this was 1998, I doubt many english teachers would be aware of them. What bothers me is that I&#x27;m fairly sure that the only reason my paper wasn&#x27;t just thrown out was that we were lucky enough to get a science teacher who was an ex-Harvard associated researcher whom moved &#x27;out to the sticks&#x27; for family reasons. It was this chap that my english professor asked, thankfully, since I&#x27;m relatively certain that no one else in the school, let alone the rest of the science department, would have had a clue. Without that stroke of luck I&#x27;d have probably been given an F and not even considered writing outside the box papers again, or at least delayed writing another one.<p>Side note, but this random teacher I had was amazing, he really changed a lot of the way I look at things. From his profession (biology), to thinking entrepreneurial, to learning the basics of the stock market when I was 14...I learned a lot from that guy. All because we were just lucky enough to have someone of his caliber there to glean knowledge from. It&#x27;s amazing what a single teacher can do to change someone very early in their life.",1393033466

(Or substitute Command if you&#x27;re on a Mac--same basic idea.) They&#x27;ve got that down cold, along with a host of other ubiquitous editing conventions--Ctrl-Left/Right to jump words, Shift-arrowkeys to highlight, Home/End to jump to the beginning/end of the <i>screen</i> line, etc etc etc. Basic text navigation and editing is a breeze, straight from muscle memory.<p>Then you try command-line Unix for the first time and <i>nothing works anymore</i>. You have to unlearn the habits of a lifetime before you can do something as simple as <i>edit text</i>. You can&#x27;t even remap them effectively, because most of them do something <i>else</i> in vim or bash that you&#x27;d have to move elsewhere.<p>This is one of those problems that is just completely invisible to old Unix hands. It took me years to stop writing code in Notepad, because using vim felt like trying to drive a car with the gas and brake reversed, and someone punching me in the face every time I reach for the turn signal.<p>I&#x27;m not saying Unix conventions are <i>objectively</i> worse than Mac/Windows ones. Once you&#x27;ve got them trained into muscle memory, they&#x27;re just as effective as anything else.

Perhaps that is true just in mathematics, physics, and maybe even computer science but unlikely to be true in many other fields. Let&#x27;s be realistic and realize that the majority of people do not use LaTeX. The ones who do use it, use it because they are putting in a lot of mathematical formulae which are easier to do in LaTeX than Word (although Microsoft is making progress with the equation editor) and the formulae look way nicer in LaTeX. Word renders the formulae into an equation that generally looks bad and scales worse.<p>The things that I use LaTeX for are usually my own writing that I don&#x27;t have to collaborate with other people for.

Consider that modern websites use a communication protocol first developed in the 1990s and run on operating systems largely inspired by one developed in the 1970s. Of course, some things do change quickly, like what database/programming language/web framework is &quot;in&quot; at this particular time. The underlying concepts, however, do not change as quickly, and those are the things that engineering schools tend to teach. I just graduated from engineering school and started working. The things I learned in engineering school come up all the time. I&#x27;m especially glad I took Operating Systems. Sure, you could get through college and get a CS degree without learning anything practical, but if you pick challenging and practical classes, you&#x27;ll come out a much better engineer.<p>Also, about the &quot;4 years is a high opportunity cost&quot; thing. Given how it&#x27;s much easier to find a high-paying software engineering job with a bachelor&#x27;s degree than without, it&#x27;s probably worth it. Besides, just because someone is in school doesn&#x27;t mean they can&#x27;t follow along with the latest industry trends, especially in CS where much of it is open source. It&#x27;s not like the only learning you do in college is in your classes.<p>So my advice to matteotom is ... go to college. Take challenging classes that interest you (I highly recommend studying operating systems, compilers, and computer architecture). But also, don&#x27;t neglect the opportunity to learn things outside of class (sounds like you won&#x27;t really have much of a problem here). Do internships in the summers to get some industry experience (and a nice paycheck). And yes, of course, don&#x27;t forget to make friends and have fun (I certainly wish I did more of that in college).",1393032648

I think the real question needs to be focused at how it&#x27;s applied, whether it&#x27;s used solely for good or evil.<p>It is not inevitable.  Also all technologies are used by <i>people</i> meaning they are used for good <i>and</i> evil.<p>I say it is not inevitable for a couple reasons.  First, in order to be super-accurate, you have to be able to make inferences based on existing data to a very high probability of correctness.  Unfortunately, these inferences are based on hidden assumptions and can&#x27;t be tested.  Therefore you have no way of knowing how accurate the mass surveillance actually is.   Worse, the more massive the surveillance becomes, the more of an inkblot you have to work with.  As Heisenberg said, &quot;Data does not imply theory.&quot;[1]  And the more data you have the easier it is to delude yourself into thinking all the conclusions are perfectly accurate because of confirmation bias etc.<p>So you have solid epistemological reasons that the technology <i>can never</i> become super-accurate.<p>Additionally deployment isn&#x27;t inevitable.  What&#x27;s really going on here is that companies are trying to sell products to the government, and Congress is allocating lots of money to buy them.  Funding decisions are political and they are not inevitable.<p>So in my view, this technology creates more problems than it solves (on a good day even), and represents a way for wealthy individuals to get money transferred to them.<p>[1]  Heisenberg, Werner.  &quot;Physics and Philosophy&quot;",1393032191

This is something that&#x27;s been apparent to a lot of people for some time.  Not only did Noam Chomsky write extensively on this subject but Hilaire Belloc wrote more or less the same thing about newspapers in 1918 in &quot;The Free Press&quot;.[1]<p>One of the key things Belloc pointed to was the necessity of non-corporate, decentralized, topical, and outright propagandist press to counteract the effects of corporate newspapers.  I think he&#x27;d be very pleased to see the current blogosphere.  So the author&#x27;s points about the necessity of decentralized technology actually go quite a bit further than the points he makes.<p>On the other hand though, it seems to me that what this shows is that there is no bright line between dystopia and normal life.  By some measures, of course, we are already <i>in</i> a surveillance state dystopia.  So I am not sure the question is meaningful.<p>The major problem that makes the dystopian elements of the present hard to dislodge however are the twin facts that:<p>1.  American culture is very much focused on impersonal institutions of scale (central government, big corporations), and individualism, and this isolates individuals, denying them support break free from the impersonal institutional bonds that we have created in substitute for the bonds of family, neighborhood, and community (which were stronger when I was growing up and are stronger where I am living right now, Indonesia).<p>2.  We place our primary protections of the individual not in social ties (common everywhere else) but in documents which purport to restrain the central government (namely the Bill of Rights).<p>My view is that until we can start focusing on building stronger communities, decentralizing government and bringing the power closer to the people, and decentralizing the economy (disfavoring large businesses in favor of small ones) the dystopia will in fact deepen.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18018"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/18018</a>",1393031698

Require students to take &#x27;basic&#x27; classes in all subjects (up to whatever level of competency you require), but also require them to take advanced classes in subjects of their choice. In addition to furthering their knowledge of their own interest, these classes also provide a much better opportunity for students to learn how to research, study, write, ETC, because they can do all of those things on a topic that interests them.<p>Additionally, having just a few such classes can change the perception of school from a place you have to go, into an opportunity to learn that happens to require you to learn some things you are not interested in.",1393030971

However I really think that we can do better and the famous, great editors (vim, emacs, acme, etc.) all have different features that make them great and unique. I prefer vim because of its modal nature which might be the reason why I find it also ergonomically superior (after remapping ESC to jf) - e.g. I don&#x27;t like it to stretch my fingers.<p>On the other hand I never really script vim as I find vimscript just terrible. This is far better in emacs as it uses a decent programming language.<p>The third aspect I think is not well-designed is window/buffer-managment. In my opinion this point could be outsourced or developed in connection with a tiling WM or terminal multiplexer like tmux/screen (this part is best in acme).<p>A modern approach I thought about (Yet Another Text Editor Syndrome) would be a client-server architecture with a server node storing buffers with context information (filename, cursor, etc.) to which clients can connect.

But it is the &quot;sensation&quot; of pain that gives it its moral significance, otherwise inflicting pain would be no different morally than flipping on the switch to an electrical circuit.<p>> The same is true for consciousness. What&#x27;s difficult about it is that it&#x27;s not a thing, there&#x27;s no hormone for consciousness, there&#x27;s no brain centre where it&#x27;s localized, rather it&#x27;s a process and a product both phylogenic and ontogenic<p>I can only conclude that you mean something different than I do when you say &quot;consciousness.&quot;  To me the sensation of pain is a subset of consciousness.  It&#x27;s the difference between electricity &quot;falling in the middle of the forest&quot; so to speak and electricity that causes some sentient being to feel discomfort.<p>> Actually, it&#x27;s very useful in showing why worrying about subjective sensation of consciousness is completely useless in AI<p>Sure it&#x27;s useless <i>to AI</i>.  To AI the zombie problem doesn&#x27;t matter, because the goal is to produce intelligence, not sentience.  But it&#x27;s useful in a conversation about what sentience and consciousness mean.<p>If we created intelligence that could pass the Turing Test against anybody, it would be basically impossible to know if it experiences sentience in the way that all of us individually know that we do.  But that is the essence of the zombie problem.  Where does sentience come from?  We have no idea.<p>Actually I take it back; the zombie problem will be extremely useful to AI the moment a computer can pass the Turing Test, because that&#x27;s when it will matter whether we can &quot;kill&quot; it or not.",1393030803
