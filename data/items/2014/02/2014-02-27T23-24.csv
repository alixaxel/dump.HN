7316280,comment,7314422,7314422,9,0,DanBlake,,,"True P2P streaming is more trouble than its worth. Take it from a guy who streams petabytes a month and has looked into it more times than most.<p>P2P has 2 main advantages, both of which are voided by this implementation:<p>1: Better latency. If Joe talks directly to Sue, that is the fastest connection possible, as opposed to Joe -> Server -> Sue<p>2: The host saves on bandwidth costs<p>Now, point #1 is moot because this needs servers to work for live broadcasts with lots of viewers. Also, even if server were not on the mix, you are still going to need your data relayed several times depending on how far from the source you are. You cannot hype away the fact that if a person is streaming a 1080p video at 1mb/s and the average peer has less than 5mb/s outbound, that the delay in getting that video to the thousandth viewer is going to be exponential unless you add in servers anyways.<p>Point #2 is mostly moot for 2 reasons. The first reason is the cost of bandwidth is almost dirt cheap now. You can get a unmetered 1gb/s line for under $200/month. \nThe second reason is that when you go full P2P, you lose out on a lot of value adds that people like. Things like transcoding for different sizes / mobile as well as DVR style seeking/recording.<p>Another reason which I am sure will be hotly contested by the developers is that the quality will be more unreliable than a direct server. Last mile Peers are the worst for sending data. You want to typically be in a hub for direct peering to the various end points (comcast/tw/etc.)<p>In most cases, Its unfortunately the case that P2P causes exponentially more headaches than it solves.<p>Now, that is not to say that multicast does not have its place in the world. Just that its more of a feature to compliment traditional relay streaming vs being a product on its own.",1393545593

I took several classes using PLT scheme and I&#x27;ve used PLT scheme for a reasonable amount for other tasks (wasn&#x27;t called racket then). I&#x27;ve also dabbled with some lisps. I&#x27;ve read the little schemer, I&#x27;ve went through the wizard book. I&#x27;ve written the obligatory metacircular evaluator. All this got me excited.<p>Over the years though, I&#x27;ve done my best to learn the lessons and move on.<p>Is it really a surprise that lisp, an aged tool of refined elegance, was a competitive advantage over the other popular languages in 1997, which were still in their neanderthal phase? I&#x27;m not sure if the difference is that huge these days though. While in the olden days languages seemingly refused to learn from the teachings of lisp, it seems today they steal from lisp like pop artists steal from each other. Say, a ruby DSL with blocks and other tricks is not as flexible as a defmacro based lisp one, but could there maybe be a tradeoff here?<p>Writing in lisps give me what I call the intellectual warm-fuzzies. I get to use many elegant tools to form abstractions upon abstractions to create <i>the</i> DSL for my problem domain. I like that. Some call it doing the Right Thing. The polar opposite of duct-tape programming if you will. A quote from the article: &quot;to translate this program into C++ they literally had to write a Lisp interpreter [so basically a lisp-to-c++ compiler]&quot;. This is exactly the sort of thing I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s cute. It&#x27;s the Right Thing. Rewriting the code by hand in C++ is for plebians.<p>And, given enough code, maybe writing the lisp-to-c++ compiler is less effort than a rewrite initially. Maybe. I&#x27;ll allow the benefit of the doubt. But what about the machine-outputted C++? Is the code idiomatic? Is it performant? Who wants to maintain machine generated code? Who wants to maintain a custom compiler? Maybe none of these are problems, but my vote is that it&#x27;s unlikely.<p>The blub paradox applies much more strongly (or maybe I could say &quot;only applies&quot;) when you haven&#x27;t been exposed. When you, in your arrogance, refuse to try something different. I&#x27;ve traveled up and down the proverbial ladder, and I know where I&#x27;m comfortable. For now. I suspect it&#x27;ll change sooner or later.<p>What astounds me is the arrogance to claim that lisp(s) is the One True Language, and anyone who doesn&#x27;t agree Just Doesn&#x27;t Get It. It&#x27;s like the audacity a religious person has in claiming that their god is the one and only, in effect taking for idiots all the millions of remaining people who ever existed and sincerely believed in their own creation stories.

Taxes are to high and spending is to low and policy makers believe the government -which can issue infinite amounts of currency- can actually go bankrupt.  We can model the macro economy using 3 sectors:  foreign , domestic , and government with money changing hands between each sector.  Money flows into the gov sector via taxation and out via spending. Money flows out of the domestic via taxation(to government) or spending on foreign and in via government spending or foreign consumption. Foreign is similar to domestic.  In order for any sector in aggregate to increase its income, the other sector(s) needs to spend more than its receives from other sectors by either going into debt or spending from savings. Now, with austerity carrying the day in Washington, the private sector cannot increase its aggregate income with money flowing from the government sector. With the foreign sector structured to mostly export to America ( worlds largest consumer) income is not going to flow from there.  The only thing left is for the domestic sector to borrow and spend from savings till it all blows up again.  After it blows up, automatic stabilizers go into effect ( unemployment, food stamps, stimulus etc , lower taxes due to less income tax revenue) the government picks up the slack and the economy recovers proportional to net government spending.   This is the cycle our economy ( if not the world&#x27;s)  operates on.<p>Income guarantee/Job guarantee,  lower taxes, and infrastructure programs would serve to proactively increase income to the domestic sector.

The housing prices are only going to go up in Seattle as it becomes more of a tech city (Amazon is building an entire new office in Belltown, for example).<p>Here&#x27;s a nice (affordable on 110k) house in Seattle:\n<a href=""http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2809-S-Columbian-Way-Seattle-WA-98108/70579960_zpid/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2809-S-Columbian-Way-Seatt...</a><p>And you still have money leftover for a nice German car that depreciates half its value in a few years...<p>Perhaps you don&#x27;t want to take on debt. Solid? I&#x27;d imagine your grandparents did so to build their house though as well. Also, you can even look outside of the city for cheaper real estate.<p>Unfortunately, $110k is becoming the new normalized &quot;market value&quot; for highly-qualified software engineers in America, and so the tech neighborhoods are becoming more gentrified and recalibrating their costs of living such that a six-figure salary now makes you a middle class &quot;technocrat&quot;. I maintain that living in Seattle, SF, NYC is a &quot;luxury&quot; though. If you aren&#x27;t happy with your standard of living in one of these luxury cities, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with a place like Pittsburgh, Houston, or Cleveland where a $400k house is a mansion.<p>Other than that, there&#x27;s a luck component to this as well. The waterfront home-owners with garaged Porsche 911s by Burke-Gillman trail in Seattle got in on the Microsoft ship early (i.e. early 90s), the company grew tremendously and they had a stake in revolutionizing the industry, and became millionaires off of their equity. The corporate life treated these Microsoft millionaires well (and chances are they had the same qualifications, skill sets, and risk aversions that you have now), but the opportunity of working at 1990 Microsoft pales in comparison to working at 2010 Microsoft. Nowadays, an entry-level job at Microsoft means having nine managers, living in an outrageously expensive area, and coding C# unit tests all day for a relative pittance. That&#x27;s not to say Seattle has devolved into a SF or NYC in terms of living cost though.<p>How to reap the same standard of living today? Give up the cozy big corporate job (six-figures isn&#x27;t as impressive in 2014 as it was in 1998), take a risk. For instance, join or found a startup that ends up becoming the next FB, invest in something like TSLA or Bitcoin a year ago. I can&#x27;t say what the path to success looks like now, but I can say that it involves luck, savviness, networking, and risk-taking. Who knows? You MIGHT join the right early-stage company that grows into the next Microsoft empire (I certainly can&#x27;t tell you which one), and become one of those paragons of success through following the safe corporate job route. However, you can&#x27;t become complacent doing your 9-5 ASP.NET programming, or you&#x27;ll never have that waterfront house.<p>The solution for the Microsoft millionaires of the 90s was to keep their heads to the grindstone and work up the corporate ladder, maybe even hand off to Microsoft some groundbreaking IP from their brains (for instance, the inventors of COM+, PowerShell, FAT32, PE, .NET, etc. probably own those houses). Unfortunately, this safe path no longer has nearly the same results as it did 20 years ago, and readily handing over your million-dollar brain children to a large corporation might give you a 15% raise next year in return.",1393543836

7316042,comment,7315244,7315244,14,0,RealGeek,,,"I recently moved to US (from India) and I was shocked to see how the &quot;free market&quot; economy is structured to bankrupt the middle class and poor. Indians have far less income than Americans but are somehow able to save more.<p>Here are some basic problems I see with economy:<p>1) Rent: When people are paying half their paycheck to rent a studio apartment, there is something seriously wrong. The monthly rent in most areas is more than 1% of the property value, which is insane. Why pay $2,000 per month to rent, when you can buy it for $1,500 per month mortgage which won&#x27;t increase every year and will build value towards your equity. In India, most people own houses or spend around 10% to 20% for rent; despite the property being far expensive than US. Example: it costs $500k to $1 million to buy a 2 bedroom apartment in Delhi, but you can rent it for $600 to $1,200.<p>2) Healthcare: Our healthcare expense in India was less than $500 per year (without insurance). It is more than $20,000 in US, and we are still held hostage by medical practices and insurance companies. Examples: wait 3 weeks to schedule an appointment with your doctor; $this is not covered by your insurance; pre-existing conditions.<p>The drugs I bought in India for $10, costs $200 in US; there are drugs created by Indian pharmaceutical companies and sold to US pharmacies for $1 (they still make good profit on it), but it is sold for $100 in US. The prices are artificially inflated so high that it is not affordable by 99%, so they are forced to buy insurance. This isn&#x27;t free market economy, this is extortion by monopoly; there should be no place for middle man in healthcare.<p>3) Banks are designed to screw consumers in every possible way and suck every penny out of your account. It&#x27;s is not much different in India; just the amounts are lower and banks are regulated by Government.<p>3) Service & Utility companies: most people pay around $100 per month phone and $100 per month for cable. In India it costs $5 per month for cable, and most people pay between $5 to $15 for phone. Moreover, there are no draconian contracts and service is much better; phones work in remote villages and even in lower basement of concrete buildings. It is silly how a company&#x27;s &#x27;Terms of Service&#x27; can hold consumers hostage and even super seed the law.<p>4) Consumerism: Americans are obsessed with credit cards and buying everything they can&#x27;t afford. Why does a minimum wage worker spend $100 a month to buy an iPhone when there are prepaid Android alternatives available for much less? Why do people making $30,000 to $40,000 buy BMWs and $2,000 purses?",1393543555

I have the following guesses as to why it&#x27;s so low quality:<p>1. Recruiting companies, from what I&#x27;ve observed, tend to draw from a big pool of English teachers looking for steady non-teaching work. That is, they are not technical or versed in the field they are recruiting in.<p>2. A lot of times the companies or recruiters aren&#x27;t exactly sure what they&#x27;re looking for.<p>3. Sometimes in addition to not being technical and not knowing what they&#x27;re looking for, English is not their first language (whether they&#x27;re Japanese, Chinese, or Indian).<p>I always try to engage them in some way in case I need them in the future (since Japan <i>is</i> the land of networking), but it never goes well.<p>They refuse to tell me the company they&#x27;re recruiting for, responsibilities, salary range, benefits, or even basic things like whether it&#x27;s a contracted (契約者) or permanent (正社員) position or, god forbid, a dispatch (派遣) position.<p>Whenever I ask for details, they insist that we meet in person so they can &quot;get a feel for me and my needs.&quot; And usually meeting them would entail traveling an hour across Tokyo, or in one case, all the way to Osaka.<p>So essentially, it seems like they have nothing and they want to add me to the Rolodex.<p>Disclosure: I found my current job through a very good, very communicative recruiter who was up-front with me and worked with me to secure the terms I wanted.",1393542811
7315962,comment,7310571,7310571,2,0,jstelly,,,"I have a lot of experience hiring programmers, and to me the salary range for programmers appears to be much larger than this article states.<p>Specifically this: &quot;Here are some things you can point out to your employer to help make your case that you are worth 2x or 3x what they are paying other programmers, but you&#x27;ll be lucky to be paid 25% more. If you are 10x as productive as other programmers, you&#x27;ll probably be paid no more than 2x their salary.&quot;<p>seems incorrect when compared against my data.<p>Obviously if you look at total compensation there is more than a 10X difference between groups of programmers in many cases, but even just considering salary I have seen a pretty large dynamic range.  For example, many large software companies (that I compete with when hiring engineers) pay their experienced engineers 3-4X+ salary compared to someone they might hire straight out of university.<p>The best methods of measuring productivity or value of an engineer are certainly worth debating, but the idea that the range of salary is something like 2X doesn&#x27;t hold up for me.",1393542784

It would be cheaper to pay out of a health saving account and have catastrophic insurance than pay the continuing insurance premium.  This is especially true for young workers who we are now forcing into an additional cost to support older workers.  For the price you were paying for insurance, the health saving account and paying out of pocket for those exams would have been cheaper.  People unable to pay that should have been the ones helped by a health care law, not the typical consumer.<p>If we would get rid of this &quot;one size&quot; crap and deal with the groups we actually have (e.g. &quot;ongoing expensive care&quot;, &quot;typical person&quot;, &quot;catastrophic&quot;), we would have had a much better system.

I don&#x27;t know why this is happening, but suspect it&#x27;s due in large part to globalization, in particular, better communication technologies being used to substitute cheaper labor for what was previously only available locally.<p>The decline of labor unions might be a good thing for owners, but it&#x27;s unquestionably bad for wage-earners.<p>Also, more and more jobs are getting automated as technology gets better and better, which reduces the demand for unskilled labor.<p>(3) Major across-the-board inflation. Healthcare, fuel prices (which directly affect the cost of driving, flying, shipping, food production, pretty much everything), education costs, higher tax rates (Cook county, IL, where I grew up, has over 10% sales tax, a 5% state income tax, plus federal taxes -- not inflation as such, but it does have a big effect on depleting purchasing power), food -- EVERYTHING is costing more. &quot;Six figure&quot; incomes just aren&#x27;t what they used to be.<p>I think the combination of no pensions + higher healthcare costs + more taxes (largely to fund government-sponsored retirement funds, not provide broad-based services like education/public works) + inflation is making 120k feel like 80k or less, it&#x27;s just not that visible because in nominal terms, wages aren&#x27;t going down.<p>[1] <a href=""http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/07/11/Guidolin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/07/11/Gui...</a>",1393542278

Those books are too sophisticated and deep (though they&#x27;re quite readable) to summarize here, but the shortish version is that Western economies are undergoing a lot of profound shifts driven by a combination of technology and Baumol&#x27;s cost disease.<p><i>in the last couple years have been rent, medical, and dental in that order</i><p>Alex Tabarrok&#x27;s <i>Launching the Innovation Renaissance</i> is also good: regarding medicine and dentistry, part of the issue is Baumol&#x27;s Cost Disease and part of it is the powerful lobbies that restrict entry into those fields through licensing regimes and other means.<p>Finally, a general note: be wary of any answers in this thread that don&#x27;t cite any sources and ideally those sources should be books. The issue is too complex for simple answers, and the simple answers that one tends to hear also tend to be wrong or missing a lot of important information.",1393542233

Maybe there are many things chipping away at your wealth which you haven&#x27;t been accounting for?<p>If $110k is your take-home (after taxes), you are single, and your expenses are so low, it seems you could be saving quite a lot. I know many people with similar income and expenses, and they save tens of thousands per year. This allows them to spread savings across IRAs, mutual funds, and regular savings accounts to build wealth.<p>Perhaps like many who make a ~100k range salary, you pay upwards of 30% of it to taxes? This is a huge chunk.<p>You drive; are you sure you haven&#x27;t spent more on gas than you have on dental? You mentioned dental as your third biggest expense in the last two years. This seems unusual. Gas, food, and other common expenses often make up for a large portion of total expenses.<p>If your medical and dental expenses are that high, that&#x27;s unfortunate. But you say you have some decent savings, so good for you! That shows you have the financial strength to make it through tough medical situations :)<p>If you have more savings than most people you know, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be feeling so pressured. Most people aren&#x27;t &quot;making it&quot; because they have no savings--but you are!<p>Having debt is a common reason for feeling financially stressed. If you have debt, see a debt counselor or financial advisor and create a plan to get rid of it, fast. They may advise you to use a chunk of savings for eliminating debt.<p>You say you eat out &quot;some of the time&quot;. Most people I know say that, and they mean &quot;at least one meal per day&quot;. This is not good for your finances! I personally increased my monthly savings by 50% once I limited my takeout to once per week, cooking the rest of my meals myself.<p>Lots of times it helps to have a financial advisor. If you do this, spend plenty of time finding a good one who you&#x27;re comfortable with, who listens to your concerns, etc.<p>Bottom line: track down where that $110k is disappearing to! You should feel comfortable at that salary. Especially over time, as you save and build wealth!<p>Hope this helps, or at least gives you some ideas.",1393542201

The things these concepts address are things you&#x27;re doing in your code today, by hand, and don&#x27;t realize how they can be compressed, mostly because C++ has historically lacked a concise notation for type-inferred lambdas.<p>They&#x27;re able to turn a lot of algorithms inside out; make the kernel a simple function of values where they used to be threaded through the code flow, and use things like bind to mix them back in. This makes algorithms testable and more composable, and raise the level of abstraction in the rest of your code so that you&#x27;re operating more at the DSL level for your domain, whatever it is.<p>It&#x27;s worth learning the concepts.
