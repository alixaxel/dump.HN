Diane&#x27;s hypothesis/theorem is that, because their universe is at or near a fixed point, they have in effect invented a way to have unlimited control over their own universe. While there is no causal relationship from their universe the one up the chain, the symmetry implies their actions are mirrored.<p>I&#x27;ve read some of this author&#x27;s other works. He likes playing with paradoxes like this. It&#x27;s a twist on causality (and free will), inventing a new way for your actions to have an impact on the universe in the absence of a traditional causal link. It&#x27;s pretty damn clever.",1392868785

They are capable of generalized learning and excel in the same way that humans do. They are capable of abstraction, self categorization, and online learning.<p>There are elements of past AI models in the HTM model, however to reduce HTM&#x27;s or any deep learning algorithm to a mere combination of past AI concepts overlooks the power of the right model when it is achieved. It would be like saying that Facebook is just a news feed. Sure, that&#x27;s what gets most of the eyeballs, but there&#x27;s a lot more there which would drastically reduce its value if not present.<p>What I think is most interesting is that we may find that Humans learn pretty inefficiently from the perspective of the amount of input data required over time. This may seem silly at first, but when you consider how many neurons cover the surface area of our ears and eyes and then consider the fact that it takes anywhere from 12 to 14 months for a child to speak its first word, you might start to agree with this line of thought. Also, when I consider the fact that this processing all happens in parallel even further pushes me in this direction.<p>Whatever the case may be, HTMs are definitely a cool area of research. For those who are interested, you should definitely check out more of Jeff Hawkins work at Numenta. They&#x27;ve been able to demonstrate some pretty novel things. He wrote a book back in 2006 that blew my mind.

Perhaps bigger issues for distros are:<p>- Symbol versioning: If you have a newer glibc installed when you build your packages, they&#x27;ll refuse to run on older glibc, even if they don&#x27;t need any of the new version&#x27;s features. This makes it hard to make packages that support multiple versions of a distribution (e.g. a stable release with an older glibc and an unstable release with a newer one).<p>- Awkwardness of upgrading: For example Debian usually wants you to restart X and any daemons that use nss when glibc is updated. There are also atomicity issues during upgrade where there&#x27;s a race window during which execing programs can fail.<p>On the other hand, distros are invested in a huge set of packages as well as support for third-party (often non-free) software, all of which are presently linked with glibc.

Indirect contact methods are in my profile.<p>I have never heard someone use the term &quot;darkworker&quot; until you brought it up, but it makes sense if people are going to talk about &quot;lightworker&quot;. I have met and know a lot of folks who polarize things like that; many of them have great wisdom and I respect it, yet at the same time, I have learned not to bring up things like deliberately stalking your shadow. It freaks them out too much.<p>I&#x27;ll try to describe this in a way that is OK for a public forum (and as I said, feel free to contact me privately).<p>If you ever had the experience of unity consciousness, that is the base. A lot of &quot;lightworkers&quot; have experienced that. However, I don&#x27;t think they ever went through the implications of what that experience means. For them, there is some notion of &quot;alignment with source&quot; or something similar. Lots of wisdom comes out from it.<p>However, if you have attained in the insight of oneness ... then how can anything, no matter how dark, terrifying, or evil be <i>not</i> an emanation of source?<p>There are significant teachings and methods where, <i>after</i> attaining the insight of oneness, you have a basic connection of true nature; and as such, you can also recognize true nature in any and all phenomena. It is in this way that transmutation can happen. You stalk the shadows in order to bring light there, to see the truth for yourself and to see the truth within the dark.<p>It is also risky, since, this kind of practice easily attracts people who have a fixation on darkness (for a variety of reasons). Or, if you have any shred of arrogance, or messiah complex, or trying to be the hero, all of that comes out when you stalk the shadows. But then again, if you have the insight of oneness ... where else is there to go? There is no such thing as raising the consciousness of just the folks who are good, or &quot;in alignment&quot; or some other such notions. And further, stalking the darkness like that will suss out all the karma and obscuration within you faster than anything else will. This is why there are yogis and sadhu who meditate in the cremation grounds (because they recognize all is the cremation grounds).<p>What is also interesting is that these practices themselves tends to trigger a lot of fear in folks. One of most potent practices is awesome: it will, over time, allow you to release deep trauma like few other practices will. We&#x27;re talking heavy shit here: PTSD, ardent desires to self-annihilate out of shame and guilt, rape, etc. A teaching and a method that helps heal that kind of stuff, that&#x27;s an awesome gift to the world. Imagine the kind of compassion it took for the originators to see into the dark and create such a gem.<p>Yet when I have recommended it for friends, they react to it just like the first two times I encountered it in my life: great fear and aversion.

We&#x27;re greedy, we&#x27;re killing tons of animals, chopping down rainforests, destroying the ocean and planet, starting wars with one another, and committing unspeakable acts of evil at times.

It acts friendly, and talks about how humans and robots should live together, and if we make robots with a similar intelligence, they could drive our cars, shine our shoes, cook us dinner, look after the elderly, open your pickle jar, etc. So, we listen to the AI, it&#x27;s smart, and friendly, and we build all these robots. It&#x27;s right, the new robots are doing great and helping us out. Then the robots start building more and more robots. They start building robots with firepower, so they can, you know, shoot down threatening asteroids, or stop one of those dangerous human types that goes on a killing spree in our society.

Preventing Google from getting a leg up in the social space (especially since Hangouts is actually a very good product, despite having what I presume to be a comparatively low active user base) is probably worth far more than $16B to them, so in that sense they got a good deal.

That means that stock price is overpriced by a factor of 3 (and at least 2).  So FB is really only paying $4B + $4B + $1B.

You seem to indicate that I in fact didn&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m going to call that a success for rephrasing.  If I get you wrong, I hope that you&#x27;ll tell me what you actually meant, which you didn&#x27;t do here.<p>Let me try saying things another way.  If I ask, &quot;what does &#x27;ready&#x27; mean?&quot; and you reply &quot;it means &#x27;<i>ready</i> to move forward in the process&#x27;&quot; (my emphasis), you&#x27;ve defined &quot;ready&quot; by reference to itself, which is obviously incapable of being helpful.  So I did my best to determine what you might have meant.  The entirety of my complaint is that, lacking domain knowledge, and faced with a job ad saying &quot;no knowledge is necessary to apply&quot;, I was told &quot;you&#x27;re not ready to apply, come back when that&#x27;s no longer the case&quot; and then, upon asking, was not given any guidance as to how to determine whether I was or wasn&#x27;t ready.  So, in answering the question &quot;am I ready to move forward in the process?&quot;, all I can do is devolve it into the question &quot;do I want this process to go forward regardless of the outcome (which I can&#x27;t predict), or would I rather remain paused?&quot;.  That&#x27;s purely a question of, in the words I used before, how quickly I want to conclude the process. I can&#x27;t refer to any other variables or goals, because I can&#x27;t evaluate those.<p>> If you&#x27;re so incapable of self-introspection that you can&#x27;t accurately judge how well you understand material without external validation [...]<p>Nobody can do that.

Future assets, especially in community property states, usually have to be specifically disclaimed by the other party in the marriage before they can be considered separate property.  For example: A prenup can&#x27;t specify that a house bought after marriage is separate property, but the non-owning spouse can voluntarily sign away rights to that property as a recorded instrument.  This is why some deeds say &quot;John A. Doe, Grantee, a married man as his sole and separate property.&quot; (Some states allow for property purchased with separate assets to remain separate inside the marriage but the paper trail on this better be meticulous if a divorce ever happens.)<p>Editorializing: Why would a spouse be no less entitled to reap the rewards generated by the other spouse&#x27;s start-up?  A relationship, especially a marriage, is inherently two people acting as a unit, so just because one spouse didn&#x27;t sling PHP and research lambdas all night doesn&#x27;t mean that either spouse&#x27;s contribution is more or less valuable.  If my spouse accomplished something like this, I&#x27;d be thrilled at the success and genuinely looking forward to our life together with much less time and stress investment from both of us, since that means that I was also picking up a lot more of the &quot;home life.&quot;",1392865894

Meanwhile, bandwidth demands have exploded in just 10 years. That&#x27;s a blink of an eye in utility timescales. 100 year old water pipes are still usable. 10 year old network infrastructure can be obsolete. Public institutions simply aren&#x27;t able to bring to bear the kind of capital investment necessary to keep up with changing internet technologies and growing demand. People complain about telecoms not investing enough in infrastructure upgrades, but our public infrastructure is has accumulated trillions of dollars in maintenance debt. Even as demand is stable, its a challenge to just maintain existing levels of service in our water, sewer, and power systems.",1392865226

It&#x27;s unlikely to even work for building apps that weren&#x27;t specifically designed for Bionic, since it&#x27;s rather deficient in its support for many of the standard functions, and also differs moderately from glibc and other more popular libcs in the extensions it provides. Really Bionic was just created to be the minimal libc needed to run Dalvik (Google&#x27;s &quot;JVM&quot;) and everything else looks like an afterthought. I&#x27;d really like to add Bionic to the comparison table, but I haven&#x27;t found a way to build it outside of building a whole Android development environment, which is a huge headache...",1392865224
