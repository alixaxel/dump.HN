It&#x27;s been argued that this is in fact one of the limitations of orthodox / neoclassical economics, in that it assumes that unlimited growth it possible.<p>That&#x27;s a view that&#x27;s championed, interestingly, by both the far Left (Marxist and Socialist economists) and the Right (business lobbies, various cornucopian ideologues, putatively much of the Koch-backed propogandasphere, and their Libertarian sycophants).  Curious bedfellows.<p>I&#x27;ve only recently run across an essay of Garrett Hardin&#x27;s (of &quot;Tragedy of the Commons&quot; and &quot;Lifeboat Ethics&quot;, with whom I&#x27;ve long been acquainted), &quot;The Feast of Malthus&quot; (<a href=""http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles_pdf/feast_of_malthus.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles_pdf/feast_of_ma...</a>) which explores this idea further.  He notes specifically:<p><i>I think that a single overarching view accounts for these and many other      invectives put forward by Marxists and liberals during the past century and a   half: this is the tightly held denial of limits in the supply of terrestrial    resources. Friedrich Engels, Marx&#x27;s collaborator and financial supporter,       asserted baldly that &quot;The productivity of the land can be infinitely increased  by the application of capital, labour and science.&quot;</i><p>Much of the essay continues on to discuss population.

You could be right to some extent in that he is indeed a good &quot;moral deflector&quot;, but the main point I was trying to make still stands, in that one bag of chips is not something that will significantly change your chances for cancer or whatever other disease could be associated with eating a lot of the stuff.<p>Same with cigarettes. Indeed they have been undoubtedly linked to cancer, but still, if I smoke only one it really won&#x27;t make a difference. Same with spam, one email every few months, as has been my experience with gmail for the past several years for example, really does not annoy me more than a mosquito could. There&#x27;s a difference between working on a bad product such as, let&#x27;s say hand grenades or other stuff actually made to harm, and working on a product that is definitely bad but only if you actually let it be, i.e. abuse it.<p>My point is that the blame is not on who makes the product, as the product maker does not make said product with the intention to harm, even if they <i>do</i> know that if you cross a line it <i>will</i> be harmful. The blame is on the person that lets this product ruin its life. Just like any drug. If I hit a joint right now, I guarantee that it won&#x27;t harm me. But if I let it run my life and I stop working because I want to smoke weed, then the blame&#x27;s on me, not on whoever grows the weed or even the one who sells it to me. Precisely the reason as to why we usually put age restrictions on certain things, as we deem children to be not capable of drawing this line between use and abuse of things that could end up being very harmful. However as we grow up we believe that we are then capable of taking responsibility for your life choices. Including giving yourself cancer or diabetes by only drinking cola and eating chips.",1392433656

7242473,comment,7242155,7242155,5,0,scythe,,,"So, in general, the failure of a specific prediction from x theory does not in general invalidate the theory, in this case because all of the failed models depend on <i>other assumptions</i> than anthropogenic global warming. This is not because of any limitation of AGW but because <i>climate forecasting is hard</i> and <i>any</i> attempt to predict the goddamn future is going to require a lot of assumptions about a lot of things that can&#x27;t be predicted (chaps theory). That&#x27;s okay, because AGW is <i>not based on climate models</i> in the first place, but on a first-principles understanding of radiative forcing and a <i>very</i> well-established &quot;fossil record&quot; of old temperatures. Repeat after me: AGW is not a climate model.<p>Simply put, there is no precedent in the entire history of the planet Earth for overall heating as pronounced and rapid as the past 100 years of AGW. There are really only two possibilities: either humans are responsible for basically all of the heating, or there is a giant demon who is trying to stir-fry the human race.<p>So if you think that the recent warming is not anthropogenic... find Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis, fast.",1392433454
