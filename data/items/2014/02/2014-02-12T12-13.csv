He does drink coffee most mornings and that really helps him.  But we&#x27;d avoid medications if possible.<p>Here in Indonesia such things are still very stigmatized but there&#x27;s a positive side to that too, in that the definition of &quot;normal&quot; is much more expansive.

What creates the chilling effect is mass surveillance _combined with power_.

7223972,comment,7218913,7223509,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Just to make one clarification:<p>Obviously the household exists in a context regarding dealings with other households in a traditional culture so intrahousehold dynamics are important.  Again, I said I saw modern feminism and women&#x27;s suffrage arising as a response to changes in the interhousehold space brought on by industrialization.<p>This being said matriarchy and patriarchy are almost always a question of intra-household dynamics.  The question is, whether women effectively hold the keys to power or whether women are isolated from eachother, unable to effectively organize and make their agendas compelling.  A strong matriarchy/patriarchy in the household is a good indication of women being able to do this (again one sees this in Greek material despite the fact that the society was formally patriarchal with formal privileges associated with men only, see the drama of Lysistrata for a dramatic account, but also look at Faraone&#x27;s works cited above).<p>The family is also generally a state in miniature.  What goes on with the family is a mirror of state power structures (see Elaine Combs-Schilling, &quot;Etching Patriarchal Rule&quot; for some brief discussion of this, but also see &quot;Mass Psychology of Fascism&quot; by Wilhelm Reich for a psychologist&#x27;s view).  So intra-household dynamics are the among the best indications of political power structures in the whole of society.<p>In short, whoever has power at home, has power everywhere.",1392209615

7223967,comment,7223582,7223768,8,0,mjn,,,"> the severance and extended benefits are far more generous than any layoff I&#x27;ve been through here in the states<p>Interesting. Are big tech companies less generous than big engineering firms in other fields? When companies like BP, Boeing, etc. have had layoff rounds, 3 months is just about the minimum package for an involuntary termination, and it&#x27;s common to first offer <i>much</i> higher voluntary packages to reduce headcount without having to actually fire (sorry, &quot;terminate&quot;) people, especially longtime employees. My dad accepted a voluntary severance package equal to <i>18 months&#x27;</i> salary some years ago (something like &quot;1 month per year of service up to a cap&quot; is a common formula for voluntary offers).<p>I think this is in part due to what you mention: the morale of the existing employees can be significantly impacted by how their former colleagues were treated. Many people know each other out of work, so escorting the employees out of the building by security with no warning is not going to successfully keep them from talking, and if anything will probably just make them more resentful when they meet up for a beer after work to discuss how the layoff was handled. The former employees may also turn up in other situations (college recruiting, industry organizations, consulting/sales, etc.) where it&#x27;s not to your company&#x27;s advantage for there to be a lot of people floating around who hold a grudge about the manner in which they were abruptly laid off.",1392209473

7223964,comment,7223582,7223807,11,0,eitally,,,"What the heck are you going on about?  IBM sold a division of their hardware business to Lenovo, who apparently didn&#x27;t agree to absorb all of the personnel IBM had supporting it, so they&#x27;re -- poof -- redundant.  IBM obviously wasn&#x27;t making much, if any, money selling x86 servers, and it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable that they couldn&#x27;t find obvious positions for xx,000 people whose jobs and specializations suddenly don&#x27;t exist anymore.  This is as cut & dried as these things can be.  Compare, for example, to the preemptive huge cuts many technology & manufacturing companies made in 2007 (the smart ones, foreseeing what their soft 2007 market would turn into in 2008++) and 2008 (the either less savvy or more empathetic/hopeful companies).  &quot;Sorry, we&#x27;re cutting a large portion of our workforce because we&#x27;re pretty sure the market is going to tank and we need to mitigate our risk exposure to the downside.&quot;  That doesn&#x27;t go over nearly as well with employees as &quot;Sorry, we sold the division you work for and the buyer didn&#x27;t want you.&quot;<p>I work in contract electronics manufacturing, for Sanmina, and in Oct-Nov 2007 we laid of 16% of our global workforce of ~50,000.  Compared to our competitors who waited until 2008 (Jabil, Celestica, Flextronics, Plexus, Benchmark, etc), this ended up being a very smart decision.  Just compare the stock prices of each company over the past five years.  In 2003 we won the PC & Thinkpad manufacturing business from IBM, which accounted for about $3b/yr in revenues over each of the subsequent five years.  <i>Revenue</i>, not profit.  We only made about 1-1.5% profit on that ridiculously tight margin commodity hardware business.  In 2008 we sold it to Foxconn & Lenovo, much like IBM just sold their x86 server division to Lenovo.  It is a smart purchase for Lenovo because they have ready access to cheap manufacturing capacity <i>and</i> they operate at a scale that allows them to negotiate much better deals throughout their supply chain than IBM could.  This is the same reason Foxconn, Pegatron, Compal, & Quanta are [roughly] the only ones making money hand over fist building consumer products: either they negotiate exclusive deals on high-demand, high-margin products (e.g. Apple) or they just operate on such a huge scale that they get optimal prices on direct material and freight.  It&#x27;s impossible to compete, which is why the smaller (say, $3-10b/yr revenue) EMS companies have intentionally focused on low vol / high mix / high margin areas over the past 5-7 years.  This includes things like defense goods, medical products, network infrastructure (especially microwave & optical/fiber), robotics, and similar complex or highly regulated products.<p>In our deal, we had to layoff a few people, but not too many and mostly direct labor (factory workers) and lower level business management.  We &quot;sold&quot; a full 10% of our global IT staff to Foxconn in the deal, and they took over a high percentage of the business folks responsible for the business, too.  Why?  Because they wanted to ensure continuity in the marketplace.<p>This just isn&#x27;t something Lenovo needs very much of from IBM for server support.  They&#x27;re already a hardware company and already have the same or similar functions in their existing org.  If these people being laid off are good, they&#x27;ll be in demand and easily hired elsewhere.  It&#x27;s not like the Indian domestic market is suffering lack of demand, and it isn&#x27;t like US companies aren&#x27;t still clamoring for an increase in the H-1b limit (not to mention all the L-1/L-2 visas out there).",1392209338

I still seem to have this uncanny ability (at times) to solve programming issues (I&#x27;m a developer). I used to think I had trouble relating to other people and set out to live a more passionate life, and spent a lot of time with less intellectually oriented people. One thing I learned (and I had to learn it, as in spend effort on acquiring some kind of knowledge) is that intelligence is so much more than what I thought it was. It is not just about solving problems, it is also about experiencing and appreciating reality, and how to share and express your appreciation of reality. It clicked one day, and I have pretty much no problems anymore connecting with people, regardless of how trivially solvable their &quot;problems&quot; are.<p>This is a bit rambling and dishing out advice, and I don&#x27;t want it to sound that way.

UDP is a connectionless protocol, so there is no handshake before data is thrown at the vulnerable target.

I take a more philosophocal stance to the issue of society than &quot;freedom above everything&quot;. That&#x27;s not to say I&#x27;m against freedom, but I understand that they are nuances to that.<p>For one, everybody acting the way he pleases, even in areas that seem innocuous or totally a personal choice, can have potentially harmful impact to society at large.<p>Who&#x27;s to say what&#x27;s harmless? This requires a notion of harm, and harm to one&#x27;s customs/preferred way of life/kind of society he wants, is also a kind of harm.<p>Even something as basic as the right to eat whatever you want (e.g consequences for obesity rates, social welfare costs, etc). So it depends on what the priorities are. Not everybody, and not every culture, puts the individual ahead of society. Nor it is self-evidently right to do so.<p>><i>That you&#x27;re allowed to post this comment is a social norm. Not allowing you would also be a social norm. Is there no real argument for why you should be allowed to comment?</i><p>Well, not really. If the goal of the forum was &quot;total openess and free expression for all&quot;, there would be an argument against disallowing certain people/comments.<p>But if a team, X, built a forum for a specific purpose, why should they allow anyone not aligned with that purpose to post in it? People make choices, not only about how they personally live, but also about how other people shall behave if they want to use/live in etc what they&#x27;ve built, from a country to a web forum.",1392206916
