7176865,comment,7176438,7176438,4,0,andyjohnson0,,,"Its worth pointing out that this is a commentary on Kurzweil&#x27;s particular view of technological singularity and how it might happen. Picking holes in his proposed theory of mind for AIs, or his relating biological evolution with technological &quot;progress&quot;, doesn&#x27;t <i>necessarily</i> invalidate the general idea of exponentially accelerating technology.<p>Kurzweil is just one advocate. In fact, the idea [1] originated with Von Neumann in the 50s and was popularised by Vernor Vinge in the 90s, and its worth reading Vinge&#x27;s paper &quot;The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era&quot; [2]. Bruce Sterling gave a interesting (and sceptical) talk [3] on the subject a while back.<p>For what its worth, I&#x27;m personally not convinced that we&#x27;ll ever see a technological singularity because I don&#x27;t think our culture generates technology that has the required attributes. Siri or Google Now don&#x27;t need to be self-aware in order to do what they do, and there is no apparent commercial pressure to make them so. And since people build technology for human purposes, the presence of people who sleep, get bored, etc. will act as a drag on any tendency for runaway acceleration.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#History_of_the_idea"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity#Histo...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.htm...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://longnow.org/seminars/02004/jun/11/the-singularity-your-future-as-a-black-hole/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://longnow.org/seminars/02004/jun/11/the-singularity-you...</a>",1391515157

This article criticizes the fact that Kurzweil crosses the barrier between biological evolution and technological evolution without mentioning it, and that the utility function used to plot the exponential across evolution barriers is ill-defined. Both observations are true, but I don&#x27;t think they shake the observation of exponential behaviour in these evolution functions.<p>The conclusion that this will all end in our minds being uploaded to the ether is more difficult to swallow, I concede. It <i>is</i> a philosophical can of worms, and it is a question that will be left unanswered, even <i>after</i> we can replicate human consciousness in a computer.<p>However, if you assume there is nothing magical about our brains, that our consciousness is merely the result of (biological) computation, then @AndrewDucker&#x27;s approach [1] is an easy way to wrap your head around the concept.

The goal is avoiding pipeline stalls:  the length of the loop is mostly irrelevant.  Tight loops (shorter than pipeline depth) are just fine if the loops are independent, and if they are not independent, you may find it difficult to create the parallelism you need to interleave.<p>You allude to it in the description, but I think a lot of the gain you are seeing may be due to Superscalar Execution (instruction level parallelism) rather than &quot;filling the pipeline&quot;.<p>I find Agner Fog&#x27;s articles and charts tremendously useful for trying to understand and optimize performance at this level: <a href=""http://www.agner.org/optimize/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.agner.org/optimize/</a><p>Related to this, you didn&#x27;t mention what CPU you are using.  The clock speed is largely irrelevant to intepretting your numbers, but the &#x27;generation&#x27; (Nehalem vs Sandy Bridge vs Haswell) can be very significant to how instructions fit together (their latencies and which can be executed simultaneously).<p><i>90% of the execution (more?) is spent in the following code sections.</i><p>If you are on Linux, start using &#x27;perf&#x27; to answer questions like this quickly.<p><i>Only an object dump will tell if the actual assembly is tighter and thereby more sensitive to speculative execution optimization.</i><p>Intel&#x27;s IACA is another great tool to know about.  It&#x27;s buggy and awkward, but does a great job of replacing the process of scribbling latencies on napkins.  Once you figure out how to interpret it&#x27;s results, it will generally answer your questions about data dependence:<p><a href=""http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-code-analyzer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-...</a><p><i>The convert instruction moves two doubles into a single?</i><p>No, not really. Intel&#x27;s docs are probably the best reference for these questions:\n<a href=""http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/...</a><p>The various abbreviations used in the instructions are useful to understand.  For example:<p><pre><code>  ss: scalar single precision\n  sd: scalar double precision\n  ps: packed single precision\n  pd: packed double precision\n</code></pre>\n<i>s_real = ((drand48() - 0.5) </i> 0.001) - 0.743643135;*<p>The conversions you are seeing are actually a problem.  The floating point literals default to double precision.  As a result, you are doing the math as a double and then converting back to a float.  You probably should tack an &quot;F&quot; on to the end of your constants to specify that you want single precision floats like your variables.  I&#x27;m not sure it will improve performance here, but it will definitely make the assembly simpler to understand.<p><i>GCC (and probably most others) seem to have essentially zero awareness or capability to deal with instruction-level parallelism.</i><p>Generally true, although Intel&#x27;s compiler is worth comparing.  They offer a free academic license.<p><i>Unfortunately the compiler had reasons to rearrange certain operations...</i><p>This is a very dangerous assumption to make.  I think a better attitude is &quot;something I did in the code made the compiler do something strange&quot; or even just &quot;compilers are dumb&quot;.  Assuming that strange changes a compiler makes improve the code is often a losing bet.<p>Hope this is helpful.  Thanks for the write up.",1391512804
