But the cities and counties generally already have a contract with Comcast, ATT and whoever and this contract may prevent competition regardless of the government&#x27;s desires. Moreover, these monopolies can mobilize their state and national level allies (some state was trying to outlaw municipal broadband utilities recently, for example).<p>The thing about State-sanctioned monopolies is that since their whole revenue stream depends on their relation to governments, they spend a substantial portion of their income getting influence within our presently rather corrupt government system.<p>It&#x27;s hard to companies that operate more on the &quot;open market&quot; to move into a &quot;turf&quot; of this sort.",1392512389

The metrics were a disaster.<p>If the JCP numbers are any indication, consumers know the price of everything and the value of nothing - they&#x27;d rather pay more than they should after a fake 40% discount because &quot;full price is for suckers&quot;, regardless of the actual quality:price value ratio.<p>The problem with cable pricing isn&#x27;t that consumers are ignorant to the deals - they&#x27;re most certainly eyeing price and discounts. It&#x27;s that cable companies have established a false baseline to decrease the effectiveness of cord-cutting.<p>As a pricing strategy, it&#x27;s nothing new. You can get 2 liters of soda for 99c, and a 12 oz bottle for 1.50. It&#x27;s a psychological price bump - not based on value, but manufactured to steer the &quot;savvy&quot; (read: performing as expected) buyer to the &quot;smart&quot; (read: preselected) choice.<p>It&#x27;s just a little more disheartening when its application moves from soft drinks to the spread of human knowledge.",1392512167

I had my final exams, 2 days with 5 exams each day at mid April (of more than a decade and a half ago, boy I&#x27;m getting older fast). Most people in my class (around 40) had been studying since November, around 12+ hours a day.<p>I begun studying in February, just due to my natural tendency to be lazy, I should have started in November too. But the point is that I tried all kind of timetables and ways to study in the next 2 and a half months. Early , late, all day, nothing.<p>I discovered that for me what it worked was 4 hours at the morning, with a mandatory break every hour.<p>Then lunch and maybe a nap or gym. Then another 3 hours at the afternoon. Every time I did less I was loosing time. If I did try to push it too much, studying till late, it was time lost sitting but not really advancing. Each hour of studying or writing had a effective time &quot;on the zone&quot; of around 20 min only.<p>But what´s more interesting is that if I studied more than 7 hours, the next day was almost lost due to my lack of concentration.<p>I managed to get the 3rd best results of my class, only failing one exam which I had only studied for 2 days. Only two students passed all the exams, and they were sitting very close and they confirmed me that they had been checking results between them when possible (yes cheating).<p>So I guess that smart studying was more important that time spent seated.

Its just not an option for most groups who would want to compete to get into that market.<p>For it to not suck I think the physical circumstances have to change.  Maybe there will be some kind of tech breakthrough with wireless technology.  Or maybe we will change the laws so that everyone has the right to lay down a cable along any public road or freeway as long as it doesn&#x27;t pose a significant threat to traffic.<p>But seems like its hard to make a law that creates a fair and democratic situation when you have limited access to such a critical resource in fairly specific places in under the street.<p>I mean, if there is already a place for fiber under the street, and you really need another line or whatever they call them, you can&#x27;t dig another trench or whatever in the street.  You have to put it with the other ones, in which case you are at the mercy of whoever controls access to that place where the lines go.  If there really isn&#x27;t a need for a new fiber line, then whoever controls the existing ones has a lot of power.<p>Just seems like the fact that there is a specific place these lines go, and a big expense and regulation, is what is causing the issues with pricing.  If this were someone&#x27;s brain being wired up like this, by a heavily regulated and monopolized cable industry, that person would be retarded.<p>I say we invent a glue or something that will attach a fiber strand to the street, a pole, or the side of a building, and declare open season.  Just put them all over the place. Like a spider web, but on the street.<p>LOL.  Sounds crazy, but I think it might actually be workable if we keep it in a thin layer on the ground.

And deferring security breach to an external tool is not a recommendation anyone should make.<p>So having a password manager would solve a SQLi? It might be the case that this is just some stolen account from phishing attack. But do we know? We don&#x27;t. So now using LastPass makes the user more confident about his or her password security inside KickStarter? How can anyone be happy with that conclusion?<p>Secondly, password managers don&#x27;t make your password more secured. Maybe I should rephrase: don&#x27;t even consider any online password manager. Storing multiple passwords in a single database that someone else owns? I don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s going to make me feel better about password security. If anything, decentralized means we don&#x27;t give a single person all the identity. Now we do. We tell LastPass here are the list of passwords I use. Great. I probably will be slightly happier with an offline password manager, but in the end, your brain can function and scale better than a service.<p>Sorry, fundamentally and practically I will have to disagree with you. And I stand by my own view and there is nothing wrong with my view and any downvote just seems ridiculous. In fact, I think people should think deeply before utilizing ANY password manager. If you have a security breach, focus on disclosure and tell people what went wrong because that&#x27;s the only thing can tell people how to do better with their account.",1392509042
