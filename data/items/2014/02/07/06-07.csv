Two years ago I started a indie game studio called &quot;Gamodo Games&quot; by myself without any help and I thought I could make a living with game development. I developed some causal games nothing fancy and nothing innovative but with a better production value then some other Top Games in the Windows phone market. With my game &quot;Furry Jump&quot; I even beat Doodle Jump and was in the top 10 over 4 weeks. All other games didn&#x27;t get very popular maybe because of no marketing at all. I&#x27;ve won some prices but never got the attention from users. I&#x27;ve earned like 2000\u0080 maybe less.<p>so why my start-up failed? I&#x27;m mean, I know my games are not that awesome, but I saw worse games making more money then my games together. After one year I had to quit my business. I&#x27;m working for a marketing agency right know making games. And they give me the job because of gamodo games so it kinda worked out for the best, but I would like to know what did I wrong?<p>If someone have some constructive critics it would help me a lot.",1391756379

It seems to be written for the audience of a site such as Infowars, which, not surprisingly, is one of the main sites that have promoted this white paper.[1]<p>Second, I was mostly interested in the author&#x27;s comparison of the rates of hate crimes committed against LGBT people in Russia and the US. Not surprisingly, the author simply compares rates reported by the SOVA Center and the FBI. Anyone who has studied criminology for five minutes knows that you can&#x27;t adequately compare the levels of crime in different areas this way. The American Society of Criminology, the largest criminological association in the world, has stated this numerous times in their publications, including their policy statements[2] (which strongly recommend against using Unified Crime Reports (UCRs) to compare levels of crime in different cities that are located IN THE SAME COUNTRY).<p>> It is also written by a lawyer who identifies themselves as part of the LGBT community.<p>Yes, and Bjørn Lomborg is a lifelong environmentalist, which I also learned at Infowars.<p>The only mention of Brian M. Heiss, the author of the white paper, anywhere on the Internet[3][4] is this white paper. Please direct me to this author, which should be easy since he&#x27;s apparently your favorite source regarding this issue.

This is a very expensive place to live, and having 1-2 roommates and still paying $1200-$1600 a month gets old.<p>if you want to have 2 kids, you&#x27;re staring at a $600k+ condo, or a $1mm+ house; 2 cars; and daycare so you can both work.  Plus 9% CA income tax.  Oh, and if you ever want to retire, you&#x27;re going to pay the state $1200/mo of rent just to be allowed to continue to live in the home you fully own (ps: don&#x27;t take this the wrong way, I understand the state needs money, but $20k+ a year between property tax, insurance, utilities, and a handful of repairs is hard to budget into retirement.)<p>A couple I&#x27;m friends with just left to move back to MI.  One was a developer with a masters from a top 10, making $140k.  The partner was an account manager and made $90k, for a total of $230.  The engineer took a paycut to $105 and the partner took a paycut to $60, for a total of $165.  However, you can buy a pretty nice home for $350k; they live near family to help with daycare (saying $400/week for infant childcare); and taxes are lower.  It&#x27;s a much better deal for them.  And again, to own a home, they need $100k+ as a downpayment and still have a housing/income ratio of 600/230 for a condo and 1100/230 = 4.8 for a detached house.  Compare to MI where they have a housing/income ratio of 350/165 of 2.1.  That makes an enormous difference in your financial lives, particularly as you think about savings, retirement, paying for college, etc.<p>So there is no &quot;should&quot; here.  It&#x27;s what do people need to be paid to live in an insane housing market with a busted ass public transport system, when there are far cheaper deals available elsewhere.",1391755547

The number of people willing to enter a field is a function of the job prospects in that field.
