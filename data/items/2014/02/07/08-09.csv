Every hero needs a villain, and if Windows had actually been good instead of merely the lesser evil I think Apple would have had a much harder time of breaking into the desktop market.  I know it&#x27;s &quot;cool&quot; to shit on Windows and Microsoft, and I actually despise Apple products, but let&#x27;s be frank:  Microsoft had a great opportunity and they blew it.  Windows 8 will not return them to their former place of glory.<p>Microsoft had <i>huge</i> mind share.  Everybody&#x27;s aunts and uncles were all running Windows in the XP heydays.  Microsoft has (had?) enormous talent but it&#x27;s seemingly been squandered.  Their design decisions in the last decade or so seem to continually shift from one boneheaded idea to the next.  Using a modern Windows is an exercise in frustration from start to finish, as Bill so helpfully illustrates here.<p>I&#x27;ve never worked at MSFT but every single bit of news I read about them points to massive, systemic cultural problems and I think those problems manifest themselves in what could have been a truly stellar series of operating systems.<p>IMHO I truly think the only thing keeping Windows in the OS game is gaming.  As soon as gaming on Linux (or even OSX) becomes viable I believe Windows will cease to exist outside the mobile space.",1391763514

Just a few months ago I stopped building a startup with my friend that I had began 7 months earlier, and ever since then I have been simply languishing. No longer with the commitment of a job or big project to keep me busy and challenged, I haven&#x27;t been doing much of anything. I&#x27;ve traveled some to see friends, tinkered away on some small JavaScript projects, and blogged a lot -- but that&#x27;s about it. Most days I just read books or browse Twitter and HN.<p>I have no clue what I should do next. I&#x27;m only 18, but graduated high school two years early and joined a startup immediately upon graduation. So this is really the first time I have been without any commitments. I was thinking about traveling the US some more and finding companies that would be willing to exchange web dev work for room and board, but I haven&#x27;t started looking into that much yet.<p>My hope with posting here is that I&#x27;ll find someone that has gone through a similar experience of languishing and getting nothing done. I feel lazy, embarrassed to meet people for fear of them asking what I&#x27;m up to -- because the answer would be nothing. Anyone have advice on how to move forward? How to find inspiration or motivation?",1391763314

Or at least, you will notice the sub-linear behavior in the scaling. Complex updates across multiple records will show some limitations on performance.<p>For things like joins, query selectivity on multiple columns, etc not so much. You don&#x27;t even need secondary indexing or denormalization to do things like graph analysis or polygon searches on a table (in the same query even) at scale. All of the access method related operations can scale very efficiently to massively parallel systems if you use the appropriate data structures and algorithms.<p>MongoDB uses an approximation of the correct algorithms for gigabyte scale systems. Those algorithms are just wildly inappropriate when you start talking about terabyte scale systems. I have no investment in MongoDB negative or positive, but like all databases it is going to be lousy outside of the implicit scope supported by the design and architecture. In the specific case of MongoDB, and as someone that has designed  their share of database engines, the internals are not designed to support non-small databases to any significant extent.<p>And honestly, a terabyte is a pretty trivial database these days. That is the kind of thing you run on a single server with ease. Smoothly scaling that to dozens of nodes as though it was a single system is something you can buy.

7195330,comment,7192320,7192320,1,0,Zenst,,,"I read this and remember back in the late 90&#x27;s when Videoconferenceing was moving away from expensive ISDN lines into the internet and thoughts of H.320 and respective document sharing (slides as this does) add-ons and extensions gave a usable platform albeit not cheap.  That changes, video compression and codec onto chips came to market and got cheaper and cheaper.<p>Now some 15 years later after many flavours, Google now offer the option but not just a feature push, but on a slow, methodical gradual feature addition which has seen the progress from VOIP/IM chat into video, into group video into a public contact phone book (aka Google+) of today.  Then into a rebrand and now just polishing to the lowest common denominator of user in userbility (I personaly prefered ealier Gmail and chat clients, but that&#x27;s me and other  quirky geeks I suspect).<p>So why is this big or important more too the point.  Well If you view ChromeOS and its features to a modern revamp of the `dumb` terminal (that were not that dumb and could do Various terminal standards and on mainframes even  form validation for numeric and alpha feilds and size of input back in the 80&#x27;s.<p>Now duringt he 80&#x27;s a company called SInclair released there next ZX Spectrum replacement which ICL modified and released the OPD (One Per Desk).  This was featurewise in mahy respects what a user today wants in a terminal, even had phone built in, though no video back in the 300baud data days.<p>So too me I see ChromeOS and the slow but sure feature set grow, as the new terminal for the cloud - aka cluster/distributed mainframes we use thesedays.  After all everything goes in circles, even technology approach. I know people can and do view webbrowsers as the terminal of our times and yes, many would be right, but if you step back a level you would want something with a little more, though not much more and a good interface and mobiles have opened up the whole touch-screen interfacing (was around in the 80&#x27;s, just not as cheap and usable) and for many tasks, work very well.  But bigger screens always will help upto a point and a real keyboard (although still stuck in a layout that seems like forcing some backwards outdated layout onto new people and children even today, think keyboard-religion).  It is with that all in mind for me that make ChromeOS seems like the `dumb` terminal of our times and remember `dumb` terminals are never dumb.<p>Now when you can add via a MCU/bridge external VC setups and studios into a hangout is when Google will be truely and finaly solidifying a technology that serves our times and needs and if anything else.  Least help stop the UN and other World leaders flying around the World to lecture us mear peons why the climate is in a mess and how we should do our part about carbon emisions, whilst they then fly to the poles for photo shoots to add onto there stories of why climate change is happening.<p>That is what Videoconferencing can truely offer and can, but its main issue has always been taking it serious compared to a jolly/plane flight/travel for so many mentality wise, again think the same mentalities that give us QWERTY keyboard-religions.<p>One day, but after over 15 years I hope this keeps the momentum and slow but sure approach google has taken so far into Videoconferencing/VOIP.  Until then we will always have `dumb` terminals and mainframes be they touchscreen clients or clustered machines called a cloud.",1391762203

Women have significant legal privileges regarding reproduction and family law above men, but these also necessarily cascade into negative implications economically (and, I interestingly, medically as well, as both our medical and economic models presume that women are only normal to the extent they approximate men).<p>Race is far more complicated, and most of the attempted solutions have largely served to dig the hole deeper.  I would suggest however that the problems are those of cultural groups with disproportionate economic problems in an increasingly centralized society.  This means the problems of race boil down to problems in four real categories borne by communities instead of individuals:<p>1.  Agency:  does the community have a real say in how their problems are addressed?<p>2.  Property:  is the land of the neighborhood owned by the people who live there?<p>3.  Capital and Small Business:  Can people in the community start businesses that the community can support? and<p>4.  Pluralism:  Is there widespread tolerance for cultural and ideological diversity in our society.<p>In terms of race we are sliding backwards on every one of these areas.<p>Religion, race, and politics can&#x27;t be so easily separated because they are all things which go together with cultural differences.<p>Fun fact:  California has <i>bonkers</i> anti-discrimination law which is extremely vague, and the ACLU has even run afoul with the Unruh act.",1391762119

The developers that I have met are almost all really interested in technology and constantly learning new things. Few developers wait to be trained if there is a useful new technology out there that could solve problems that they would like to solve.<p>So there is a 3rd way, and that is to identify the developers who are into constantly learning new things. It is not hard since you just have to weed out the 10-15% of developers who have given up on learning for one reason or another.<p>If you need developers, just hire a few people who have done some kind of development before, are at least vaguely familiar with the tools and problems that you have, and are willing to work for a graduated salary where they start around 10% lower than normal and work their way up to the full salary in 3 months or so. You will still have to lose a few before three months is up, but the upside is that you will never again have trouble finding people.<p>I used the word normal up there instead of a particular salary number because numbers vary by country and region. The right number for you is probably somewhere above the average salary for your region because if you are weeding out 10-15% of field, then you are by definition hiring above average people.<p>Sure you may miss one or two really great people who demand a high salary or they won&#x27;t leave their employer. But can you honestly say that you KNOW that these people are good if they are not willing to go through a short trial by fire? You could even rig the graduated salary so that the final yearly total earned is exactly the same as if they had been given a normal salary offer from the beginning.<p>There are lots of smart and skilled people who can learn a new language and a new platform in FAR LESS TIME THAN IT TAKED TO LEARN YOUR CODEBASE AND YOUR BUSINESS.

I should be in dire fear of a 1984-style surveillance state thanks to the continuing revelations about the NSA&#x27;s spying programs. However, I increasingly find myself numb to it all.  I haven&#x27;t acted on anything.  I don&#x27;t know what to do so I keep on living my life as if nothing had happened.  If ever Toffler&#x27;s term, &quot;Future Shock&quot; applied, it applies to me now.  Technology has transformed the world I live in so fast that I don&#x27;t know how to respond.  Consequently, I do nothing.  I used to think future shock was something that could only happen to my grandparents!",1391760547

I&#x27;ve been beating the same drum for years within my circle of friends, and I always tend to get the &quot;huh?&quot; reaction.  It&#x27;s always refreshing to discover somebody else who seems to be running on the same wavelength. :)<p>I miss USENET.  Nowadays, my digital identity has been spread to the four corners, across Facebook, Twitter, various unrelated phpBB-based sites, and places such as /. and HN.  Even if I wanted to, there is no possible way that I could re-locate every digital utterance I have ever made publicly.  Not only that, but I don&#x27;t truly &quot;own&quot; anything I write anymore.  It&#x27;s stored in some unmarked server somewhere, stuffed into a schema that has no published documentation.  I still have e-mail archives going back 10+ years, but if Facebook ceases to exist 10 years into the future, it will be like the (admittedly few) worthwhile written conversations and interactions I had with people on there never happened.  There will be no record of it.<p>There&#x27;s got to be a better way.",1391760368

Eliss does not have a gravitational (or repulsive) model, movement is either directly input or linear inertial<p>* Eliss allows splitting planets into half-planets<p>* Eliss&#x27;s field is not static, planets and traps regularly appear.<p>* In Eliss, sizes are not relevant to absorption, only color is. Differently colored planets interfere, both lose mass and the player loses health<p>* Eliss is faster-paced<p>* Eliss is very specifically built for and around multitouch, initially you can get by with a finger or 2, but as difficulty ramps up you&#x27;ll have to start using more fingers simultaneously in order to keep your planets under control and out of one another&#x27;s way<p>* I think Eliss is a better fit for very small devices (Osmos always feels cramped on a smartphone screen, Eliss did not). OTOH, Eliss simply wouldn&#x27;t work on a PC (the input does not work). I&#x27;m not sure how it works on a tablet either. That&#x27;s one&#x27;s a personal qualitative judgement rather than an objective description though.<p>Not relevant to gameplay, but Eliss also predates Osmos by several months (March 2009 v August 2009)",1391760200
