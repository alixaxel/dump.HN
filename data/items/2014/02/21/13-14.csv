VAT is always rounded down, so an implicit sum has lost some information, unless the total number of pennies is divisible by six.<p>> <i>I don&#x27;t think AAT is a government body.</i><p>Whoops, poorly worded.",1392991187
7276970,comment,7273065,7273915,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"I like most of what SA has to say, but I think PG is coaching him in response to, well, me.<p>I saw this Quora comment last night and it reaffirmed my suspicion: <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Hacker-News/Why-does-Paul-Graham-have-a-vendetta-against-Michael-O-Church/answers/4199597"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Hacker-News/Why-does-Paul-Graham-have-a...</a><p>People respond more to anecdotes than hard data. PG did, as the Quora comment mentions, give the world an anecdote of a good guy winning. After 2001, there was a huge morale crisis (because of the same ills as what we see now-- unqualified idiots raising huge sums of money, carpetbaggers from finance swooping in and calling all the shots) in the Valley, and it took Paul Graham to raise the banner and reconvince people that what was happening out there was <i>right</i>.<p>A &quot;good guy winning&quot; story, in a society on the cusp of awareness of its own corruption-- that is, facing a morale crisis-- can be really powerful in bringing back hope. However, for each PG, there are lots of good guys who lose at that game, but I&#x27;m one of the few who spoke out and called it for what it was. Most people value their own success more. I value truth. I don&#x27;t want anyone else to fall into the career-damaging trap of the VC-funded startup game. It&#x27;s just not for our generation.<p>With PG&#x27;s account and my account, the impression that all this makes is that, yes, 15 years ago (PG&#x27;s time) the Valley may have been a meritocracy, but now (for my generation) it&#x27;s just another corporate ladder-- and an inferior one to that of finance.<p>In order to prop up faith in the Valley&#x27;s claims of meritocracy, PG needs a &quot;good guy winning&quot; from our generation, and someone who can write well and see the big picture. He needs that person badly, and I think Sam Altman is really good in the role.",1392991128

It may be unfortunate, but we&#x27;re not going to change it just by talking about it. There are many people who are better off not knowing all of the world&#x27;s state variables (i.e. the truth) because they aren&#x27;t equipped to handle the complexity and context.<p>Investors who rely on social proof, if you don&#x27;t have it yet, fall into that &quot;can&#x27;t be trusted with the truth&quot; category and it&#x27;s OK to apply reality tweaks that are ultimately in their interests (giving them the courage to do the right thing) as much as yours.<p>I don&#x27;t advocate fraud (lying to people in a way that acts against their interests) but some people don&#x27;t have the courage to do the right thing unless you pull out some reality tweaks and make them comfortable.

Thus you can&#x27;t tell which fields need to be cleaned up in a destructor in case of a partial construction [1]. So destructors aren&#x27;t called for partial construction, and you need to handle the exception cleanup in the constructor. But you can&#x27;t do that for member initialization lists, so there&#x27;s this thing.<p>RAII and wrappers is one reasonable way out of the insanity, but the costs are arguably higher than zero initialization - certainly in ugliness of wrapper classes, if not in absolute runtime.<p>Forbidding exceptions in constructors is another reasonable way out, but that kind of sucks - constructors have no other way of communicating error, so you need to add isValid flags to your classes, and to be belt and braces secure, you need to check this flag for every operation.<p>The correct answer is zero initialization, possibly with some kind of pragma to prevent zero init for critical performance classes. The thing with zero init is that data flow analysis can mitigate the costs - the compiler would be able to eliminate the earlier zero assignment much of the time.<p>Overall it&#x27;s more of the same from C++: unsafe, broken by default, bodged up with hacks to make it slightly more stable, and usually works mostly OK in practice owing to limiting C++ to a reasonable subset.<p>[1] I know that technically 0 can be a valid physical address, but even for (embedded) systems that do allocate there, it&#x27;s worthwhile reserving it.",1392990009

Sure it probably cost them a lot of social and family time, but they accomplished their goals. If your goal is to have a wife, kids, and a white picket fence, with a low stress job, then go for it. No one is telling you not to. But if you want to be a senior vice president, or a founder of a company - news flash you should probably work more than 40 hours a week. Do you think every executive is smarter than the people he was promoted over? No, of course not. So most likely they worked harder and longer to get there.",1392989466
