That is, they are not disclosing information to customers that would be relevant to the customer&#x27;s decision to use their service.<p>So, for instance, with the fiat withdrawal problem, if the actual issue is that they are not solvent, but are hiding this fact in order to become so through trading fees (a popular theory), then they are shifting an extraordinary amount of risk on to the customer without his/her consent. That would represent willful misleading for their own gain.",1391680737

7189538,comment,7187174,7187452,15,0,bitwize,,,"But the flip side of that is that optimizations that were made when resources were tight may bite you in the ass when resources become available. For example, the declaration for the WinMain entry point that still persists to this very day in Win32 and Win64 applications looks like this:<p><pre><code>    int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpszCmdLine, int nCmdShow);\n</code></pre>\nNote the hInstance and hPrevInstance bits. Back in the day Windows loaded the code for a Windows application&#x27;s .EXE once into memory and then maintain several pointers to a separate data section for each running instance of the application. The hInstance and hPrevInstance are actually pointers to such datasections. One of the reasons for this was so that the program needed to only do certain kinds of initialization once; if future instances needed that data, they could copy it into themselves from the previous instance (remember, no protected memory!) with the GetInstanceData function. In addition, it was a simple way of telling if you were already running; window classes, for instance, were registered once per program, not once per instance.<p>Of course in Win32, instances of a program are their own processes with their own address spaces, so you can&#x27;t do the kinds of clever tricks you could in Win16 to save time and memory. And hPrevInstance is always NULL. Win16 programming is full of hacks like this that made sense in their day, but are counterproductive now, though their vestiges remain on in Win32.",1391680240

7189533,comment,7189334,7189334,1,0,sturmeh,,,"The issue is that if you run the same program twice without selecting a suitably random seed you will make the same 60 million rolls.<p>If you can somehow control, predict or influence the seed you can predict or influence rolls.<p>For example if the game uses JUST the system time as a seed, I can shift the system time back to a specific position and run the application again to get the same random number generation.<p>If you know the algorithm, for example you&#x27;re playing an open source card game, and you can determine the time (offset) on the server or the other players computer you could cheat by calculating their random variables.<p>Now it really isn&#x27;t an issue in games, but it&#x27;s incredibly important in security. Randomness makes up a huge component of encryption.<p>That&#x27;s why you have applications that require you to move the mouse a bit, hopefully randomly and they take in a whole bunch of other entropy fed in by the system.<p>In Unix-like OS&#x27;s you have /dev/random and /dev/urandom. /dev/random requires a certain amount of entropy and environmental noise, and it blocks on reads until it&#x27;s satisfied with the output.<p>/dev/urandom does not block, but it gives pseudo random output. For the purposes of security, /dev/urandom should NEVER be used. However neither are truly &#x27;random&#x27;.",1391680193

If this is syntactically the first field in each of the constituent records the result is well-defined.<p>This is a great solution if you need to map to a specific wire format. If you do not have that constraint and have code which uses algebraic data types a lot you should probably switch to OCaml or Haskell. There are specific optimizations to work with complex matches and for representing algebraic types in a compact and efficient way. In C++ the compiler has to work with reinterpret_casts and cannot change the representation of your data types (much). Doing the optimizations by hand is possible, but chances are that a simple-minded OCaml prototype will already perform reasonably well.",1391679481

When I&#x27;m hosting my own application, I can architect whichever failover/redundancy solution I see fit. If my application <i>does</i> go down, I have physical access to the server and the data. My dependencies are all local, clearly outlined and easy to manage (from a risk perspective).<p>On the other hand, if I trust your SaaS application I&#x27;m also trusting that <i>your</i> backup and resilience procedures are at least as good as mine. I&#x27;m trusting that <i>your</i> dependencies are all managed in such a way that a failure can quickly be remedied or a contingency plan activated. I&#x27;m trusting your providers in the same way I&#x27;m trusting you. The opaque black box of your application frankly scares me. I can manage what I can see and what I can understand.<p>Not to over generalise, but there is a trend in SaaS application  design towards the school of &quot;let someone else worry about it&quot; dependency management. This is clear in both infrastructure and libraries/frameworks. Many even outsource critical functionality to other third party SaaS services altogether (push notification, messaging, queue management, transcoding). Besides core application architecture, we also have to worry about connectivity (mine, yours, all of your dependencies). That&#x27;s a lot of moving parts which can (and do) fail.<p>I trust my transparent, well documented system with its clear contingency plans much more than your opaque SaaS application, its unknown dependencies and its myriad moving parts.<p>And as we see all too often on HN, it&#x27;s not just about downtime - SaaS applications shut down and disappear. If you&#x27;re lucky, you get a chance to export your data. I&#x27;m certainly not suggesting that companies should continue to operate them at a loss for years, but given the choice between relying on someone else&#x27;s SaaS product and depending on a locally hosted application, I&#x27;m going locally hosted every time when it concerns critical business workflow.<p>I&#x27;m not anti-SaaS at all, I just think we should be clear in our own minds about the risks introduced by relying heavily on third party providers (and I mirror that awareness in dependency management in my own software).<p>(On a side note: I find it interesting that while many of the users on HN ardently support SaaS, they condemn always-online DRM.)",1391679218

Moreover it was a place where the EU could &#x27;do good&#x27; with their superior moral values (sarcasm intended).<p>The first contribution of the EU was to keep the AKP in power.

Corruption went rampant and civil liberties were restricted. The country is being islamized. These things led to the Gezi Park protests and a diminished confidence from investors.

It would be pretty easy for a malicious developer to pay $99 (presumably with a stolen credit card), get a Developer ID certificate, and go to town. Apple can revoke the certificate, but it would come too late for a quick thing like this.<p>For iPhones, it&#x27;s possible that they got up to some shenanigans using configuration profiles. These aren&#x27;t well known, but you can install a configuration profile downloaded from anywhere, and they can do amusing things like add new root certificates, fiddle with network settings, etc. The user has to approve any new configuration profile, but plenty of nontechnical people will obediently tap &quot;INSTALL&quot; when told to.",1391677977

This work is available on Github and it&#x27;s licenced as public domain.<p>The project is not done yet. But I&#x27;m updating weekly, I will push today more structures so anyone have a base where to start a design.<p>https://github.com/meerita/avuik<p>The master file has many structures and everything is well organized. You can see what things from the screen are available and hidden, you just need to create your own file, and copy paste the folder from this master to your own design file.<p>Any comment, help, pull request will help me to help the rest.",1391677820
