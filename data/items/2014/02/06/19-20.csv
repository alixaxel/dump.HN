7192583,comment,7188789,7189989,2,0,beamer99,,,"I use a variation of this technique. I spend X minutes doing Y. Where X is 5 minutes. The 25 minutes of the Pomodoro is too long to focus on one thing.  I have a very very short attention span and I found 5 minutes to be the optimal timebox for me. Anything longer and I get bored. Now I have clock which doesn&#x27;t increment in minutes but 5minute units. It&#x27;s the only way I can make sense of the passage of time.<p>At the end of the timebox I do a 30sec review where I assess how I executed the task. Did I spend most of the time searching for information and organising material or did I spend it purely executing. I find with highly skilled people they spend most of they&#x27;re time executing. If I spent most of it searching for stuff, I&#x27;d mark it as a delay due to organisation, if I was searching on how to do the task I would mark it is &#x27;upskill&#x27;, then I&#x27;d move onto the next thing. After a few hours patterns start to emerge around similar tasks. If a lot of related items were marked &#x27;org&#x27; I&#x27;d then exploit them for automation or create them as templates for resuse. All the &#x27;upskill&#x27; marked tasks would be condensed into a learning task at a more convenient task. The idea around all of this was to progressively become more organised and more skilled so that when performing a task, I would purely be executing and not faffing about.<p>It&#x27;s a bit convoluted but it is a system that has worked terribly well since late last year and it&#x27;s made me twice as productive at work, and smarter at what I do. There are times though where I wish I could be like people around me who are able to focus on thing for half an hour or more but we all have to play the hand we&#x27;ve been dealt and mine is a chronic lack of focus.",1391716723

The main advantage threads (and lightweight threads) have is that they can block.<p>What you can&#x27;t do is this:<p><pre><code>  (defn foo [ch]\n     (go \n       (bar ch)))\n\n  (defn bar [ch]\n     (<! ch))\n</code></pre>\nfoo starts a go block which calls bar, which then blocks on the channel. For threads that&#x27;s ok:<p><pre><code>  (defn foo [ch]\n     (thread ; not sure about syntax here\n       (bar ch)))\n\n  (defn bar [ch]\n     (<!! ch))\n</code></pre>\nSo a function running in a thread can call another function that blocks.

7192576,comment,7191642,7191642,49,0,dctoedt,,,"1. Backdating stock options per se is not what&#x27;s the legal problem -- it&#x27;s that failing to account correctly for the resulting compensation charges (&quot;comp charges&quot;) can result in materially-false filings with the SEC.<p>2.  It&#x27;s a different problem as far as the internal politics are concerned.  When a company properly records such comp charges in its financial statements, can depress a company&#x27;s financial results and with it the stock price.  Hence, there&#x27;s an incentive to avoid recording such charges if at all possible.<p>3.  Now consider the interest groups / constituencies and their incentives:<p>+ Employees, sometimes vociferously, want the lowest strike prices they can get for their stock options -- that can be especially true for executives who have big grants -- and they want the stock price to be as high as possible (hence they&#x27;re not wild about recording comp charges).<p>+ Board members would like to keep employees happy, especially executives, and of course themselves and their fellow board members, if they can. Issuing options with an in-the-money strike price can often appear to be a cost-free way of promoting general happiness.<p>+ On the other hand, the constituencies that have a strong interest in strict legal compliance -- mainly the law and finance departments -- are often weaker politically than the ones who want the low strike price and the high stock price.<p>As a result, there can be a lot of subtle pressure on a CFO.  Employees and even senior executives can say, &quot;look, doing this in-the-money option grant, <i>without</i> recording a comp charge, is OK with our audit firm and with our outside counsel --- what&#x27;s <i>your</i> problem?  Why shouldn&#x27;t we rely on them?&quot;<p>(The unstated subtext being, <i>they&#x27;re the experts, not you, and we like their answer better than yours.</i>)<p>Finally, let&#x27;s not forget that outside accounting- and law firms are motivated to keep their clients happy, to be perceived as team players, and ultimately to get hired for repeat business.  They definitely have incentives to tell clients what they want to hear if they can possibly do so. Stir in the fact that when these professionals can come up with &quot;creative&quot; ways to make their clients happy, they gain in reputation with other potential clients and with their professional peers.<p>All this means that the company&#x27;s senior executives and its compensation and audit committees need to be willing and able to stand up to the pressures the other way. That&#x27;s been made easier by the news reports of people going to jail and being permanently barred from serving as officers or directors of public companies.",1391716697

The process for the sound was grabbing some video of the game, throw that in Logic, and hunt for sounds that match by tweaking the synth. The process for the music sometimes start by drawing semi randomly on the piano roll and listen to find for good bits, or sometimes by playing around with the midi keyboard, then tweak it to taste. One trick I often use is to stick to the white keys, it makes it easier when you don&#x27;t know solfege like me. :) (But it does restrict you a lot harmonically.) Once I have a good riff then I move to a riff to add on top, and so on.

7192536,comment,7191401,7192124,2,0,wmf,,,"To elaborate on my point, speculation about Bitcoin&#x27;s origin seems to produce many different hypotheses with no clear winner. It produces no actionable information and thus it&#x27;s no more productive than watching House of Cards (but equally entertaining, at least to me). The whole point of Bitcoin is lack of trust, so we shouldn&#x27;t believe anything Satoshi said even if we knew who he really was. Perhaps many Bitcoiners have already internalized this viewpoint; if they are comfortable using Bitcoin even with the assumption that it is a &quot;black op&quot;/&quot;false flag&quot;/&quot;government trap&quot; then the truth can hardly be worse. There is some precedent with Tor which is widely used by anti-government activists even though it is funded by the US military and developed by ex-NSA people.<p>Getting back to the mainstream takeover, perhaps many Bitcoiners are letting their greed overcome their principles and they won&#x27;t complain as long as they get rich.

JavaScript? Java? (Again: not a standard.)<p>You claim Microsoft ignored standards, but Microsoft actually cared a lot about being on top of standards and were involved in the standards process; if anything their fault was shipping stuff too early (which would be something you could pick on, but didn&#x27;t; it would even be a powerful and apropros argument, as that&#x27;s what Google is doing today): they cared about CSS when no one else did, and later they cared about XSL/T when no one else did.<p>You also claim that Microsoft stopped working on IE6 when they obtained dominance: I directly touch on that in my expanded comments, pointing out that it makes more sense that Microsoft stopped working on IE when they ran into legal opposition and the project became demoralizing and dangerous. Microsoft does not have a history of simply not releasing updates to products they have dominated: their updates are at times problematic to others and sometimes even self-defeating, but something really weird happened with IE6--where there was only a single service pack release during a nearly five year hiatus from any form of update--that simply isn&#x27;t well-explained by their dominance.<p>The only situation I can come up with similar to your arguments is DHTML Behaviors, which is amazingly similar in goal to that of this new Web Components stuff ;P. I will claim this is <i>exactly</i> the kind of thing chadwickthebold is talking about when he said &quot;MS pushed for adoption of proto-standards before there was any sort of agreement on how they should actually be interpreted/implemented&quot;. Here is the proto-spec:<p><a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-becss-19990804"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/WD-becss-19990804</a><p>Microsoft submitted DHTML Behaviors to the W3C in 1998, spent a bunch of time with them talking about how it would work, and in the end shipped it in 1999 as part of IE5. Maybe the timeline is tighter than Web Components today with Google, but it seems like the same story. (Note that I haven&#x27;t researched this to the same extent as my earlier comments, but I am definitly basing this off of historical sources; if you disagree with this comparison, I would be interested in hearing some similarly-historically-based arguments for how the timeline played out and why I this fundamentally different than Google today.)<p>Finally, now in this comment you talk about &quot;broke the standards&quot;: I would appreciate some citations and examples; the primary things I know that people like to argue about are issues with CSS and XSL/T that are entirely explained by &quot;pushing proto-standard&quot;... the IE box model being the prototypical example.<p>So, each one of your comments are incorrect. It thereby doesn&#x27;t matter what your conclusion is; in my earlier comments I&#x27;m arguing against people comparing Microsoft to Netscape, but in this thread I am just pointing out your statements about Microsoft are unsubstantiated. It doesn&#x27;t matter what your opinion of Netscape is, and if you reread the comment I made on this thread, my response to you, you will see that I don&#x27;t bring that idea up at all... you decided to transplant the conclusion from my citations to here, I am guessing because that is easier than addressing any of my actual complaints about your facts one-by-one? Again: none of these facts you are stating fit the history, and if you are going to keep repeating them I&#x27;d like some primary source material for them (mailing list posts or comments by developers from back when Microsoft was actually dominant or before the did, not after they lost and abandoned the web entirely).",1391715913

7192381,comment,7190866,7190866,4,0,swalsh,,,"I&#x27;ve been trying to think about &quot;rethinking&quot; government for quite a while.  The idea of a web based governance system seems really appealing, in the sense that I think the greatest strength of the web is how quickly ideas can go from concept to execution.  Its about the closest thing to a meritocracy as we&#x27;ve ever come, and that&#x27;s simply because the gate keeper is thrown away.  Think about how many great things have sprung out of places like Reddit.  Ordinary people who have a quick flash of a good idea can take 30 minutes to type something up... and sometimes it gets traction.  Getting things done in our current system requires an inhuman like persistence, and the luck of making a relevant connection.  Even if you have a good idea, its a difficult thing to execute.<p>I have this image of a framework/protocol in my head around allowing various policies to be created, and built on top of each other.  As a programmer I pretty much used object oriented programming as an inspiration.  Though I guess even OOP had its inspiration from biology.   Its a way for an organic system to grow and adapt robustly.  I think just like computer programs, government needs that too.<p>Added to that, if the web has a decent self regulation mechanism, that makes the justification of regulating the web even harder.<p>The one problem is, the advantage &quot;physical&quot; governments have is they have sovereignty.  If Amazon starts doing illegal things, the FBI can arrest Jeff Bezos.  The internet doesn&#x27;t have an equivlent means.<p>However I think there is away to have the essence of sovereignty, and that is through a new crypto-currency like bitcoin.  Imagine if to be a part, and to receive the benefits of this online sovereign nation you had to register your receive address.  If the sovereign entity had a way to embargo your ability to accept payments in the currency, it might be enough penalty to fall back inline with whatever regulations were created.  I think it also provides another means to give legitamicy to a crypto-currency.<p>An example of something that would be cool is this.  You want to create an open source space program, so you propose the idea on your local netizen forum.  The idea has overwhelming support, so someone creates a new policy component, and gives permissions to suction tax funds.  I can imagine something like that happening in hours.  Imagine initiating a public effort going from idea to reality in hours.",1391714820

Imagine all of the out of work fishermen - and not only in Ireland, but Nigeria, Brazil, the Philippines, Indonesia: These are people who literally depend upon the overfishing and plundering of the ocean for their livelihoods.<p>These organizations (the fishermen, loosely) are already influencing the political process. They are one of the reasons why the current regulations utterly fail. [Remember: It&#x27;s not as if we just noticed this overfishing problem yesterday. Governments have been trying to &#x27;solve&#x27; this issue for decades using traditional statist regulations - and of course failing, predictably.]<p>We <i>already</i> know that privatization of food sources works in practice.

You&#x27;re suggesting using it to accomplish the reverse.<p>If it&#x27;s important aesthetically that all sds operations be consistent in this regard, you can structure the allocation interface in the same way:<p><pre><code>  sdserror sdsnew(sds*);\n\n  sds mystring = NULL;\n  sdsnew(&mystring, &quot;Hello World!&quot;);\n</code></pre>\nThis is a common practice in relatively new interfaces like pthread_create.<p>> And you still want to access the old value if reallocation failed.<p>If you want to provide commit-or-rollback semantics, you could signal error via return value rather than by replacing s with NULL:<p><pre><code>  if (sdscat(&s,&quot;Some more data&quot;) != SDS_SUCCESS) {\n    /* failure path; s is unchanged */\n  } else {\n    /* s now has &quot;Some more data in it&quot; */\n  }\n</code></pre>\nbut this may be completely useless, depending on the environment(s) in which the library or program is intended to be used. On 64-bit Linux systems with memory overcommit enabled (the default), this failure path essentially shouldn&#x27;t ever happen. Instead, some process (maybe yours, maybe not) will be picked by the kernel OOM killer. Many programs just use an allocate-or-die interface, as the sds README mentions.",1391714640

7192329,comment,7190664,7190910,7,0,gandalf013,,,"A more correct version might be:<p><pre><code>    #include <stddef.h>\n\n    int buf_offset = (int)offsetof(struct sdshdr, buf);\n    struct sdshdr *sh = s - buf_offset;\n</code></pre>\nThis is because the compiler might insert padding between your struct elements and the flexible array member.  In your case, you&#x27;re using only int types in the header, so padding shouldn&#x27;t be an issue on most architectures, but consider the following:<p><pre><code>    struct header {\n        int i;\n        char c;\n        char data[];\n    };\n</code></pre>\nsizeof(struct header) on my machine is 8, but &quot;data&quot; starts at an offset of 5 from the beginning of the struct.  So, to go from &quot;data&quot; pointer to the pointer representing the beginning of the struct, you will need to subtract 5, not 8.  Here is a test program:<p><pre><code>    #include <stdio.h>\n    #include <stddef.h>\n\n    struct header {\n        int i;\n        char c;\n        char data[];\n    };\n\n    int main(void)\n    {\n        struct header h = {0};\n        printf(&quot;offsetof %zu\\n&quot;, offsetof(struct header, data));\n        printf(&quot;sizeof %zu\\n&quot;, sizeof h);\n        printf(&quot;start %p, data start %p, delta %d\\n&quot;,\n                (void *)&h, (void *)(h.data), (int)((char *)h.data - (char *)&h));\n\n        return 0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n983.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n983.htm</a> is relevant for this case as well.",1391714320
