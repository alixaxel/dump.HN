Energy conservation is a consequence of time invariance[1]. We&#x27;ve measured that the universe is inflating, and so isn&#x27;t invariant in time. So on large enough scales, energy isn&#x27;t conserved.<p>And, as a (ex-)physicist, I&#x27;d be more likely to say something about how little time we have compared to the age of the universe, or even compared to single atoms. Or about how we end up quantum entangled with the entire universe on long enough time scales (at least in some interpretations of quantum mechanics).<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether&#x27;s_theorem#Example_1:_Conservation_of_energy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether&#x27;s_theorem#Example_1:_Co...</a>",1393142058

7285239,comment,7284099,7284914,3,0,mpyne,,,"> extensive documentation that the NSA is, in fact, surreptitiously introducing security holes in software?<p>I&#x27;ve seen speculation to that, but not &quot;extensive documentation&quot;, at least from the perspective of simply breaking all hardware.<p>Buying descriptions of existing vulnerabilities is not &quot;introducing&quot; them. Nor is haranguing companies into leaving in known vulnerabilities (though that is bad enough).<p>Even things like asking companies to use Dual EC DRBG is not &quot;introducing security holes&quot; in the way we understand it, as EC DRBG is actually secure against all adversaries <i>except</i> NSA.<p>Like, I&#x27;m re-reading the Guardian article now and it talks about the NSA &quot;using supercomputers to brute-force encryption&quot; as a strategy... hardly a jumping testament to the massive brokenness of the Web.<p>Going further to read the actual list of NSA practices helps confirm this a bit too.<p>For starters if you look at the description of their SIGINT Enabling Project it states that &quot;To the consumer <i>and other adversaries</i>, however, the system security remains intact.&quot; (emphasis mine), which seems to be hinting at Dual EC DRBG (or at least, Snowden doesn&#x27;t seem to have leaked any other NSA technologies that are broken only to NSA but resistant against other adversaries).<p>The one blurb I could find about deliberately introducing vulnerabilities had a very important caveat which everyone leaves out: &quot;Insert vulnerability into commercial encryption systems, IT systems, networks, and endpoint communications devices <i>used by targets</i>&quot; (again, emphasis mine). The Guardian somehow left that out of their description of that bullet, I&#x27;m sure it was just an oversight.<p>In other words this is not mass introduction of simple exploitable but a seeming formalization of the types of corporate-government partnerships that led to things like the Siberian pipeline sabotage, to be used in specific targeted operations. Indeed the Guardian seems to confirm that in their description of the NSA Commercial Solutions Center.<p>Even Snowden has spoken up in support of the concept of targeted operations by U.S. intelligence agencies, so I&#x27;m not sure why this should be surprising; it&#x27;s the kind of stuff we <i>expect</i> the U.S. to do to gear going to Iranian nuclear weapons facilities or Syrian C2 bunkers.<p>So even if we give the NSA credit for surreptitiously breaking crypto around the world, <i>this</i> particular method does not appear to match their style or even their own internally-held methods. It seems like the kind of thing NSA would take advantage of without revealing it, but not the kind of thing they&#x27;d intentionally add to a non-targeted iPhone. And, if they did add it, they&#x27;d add it to the flashed image, not the source, à la &quot;Reflections on Trusting Trust&quot;.",1393140478

For example, a decrease in price of marijuana leads to (obviously) more marijuana use, but (less obviously) fewer DUI-related deaths.  It has also been found to be more directly linked to lower alcohol consumption.  Thus, you&#x27;d want to call them substitutes (with the economic meaning of the term).<p>However, it has also been found that banning alcohol (on a school campus, specifically) led to a decrease in marijuana use, showing that they also can behave as complements to each other.<p>Its all very complicated and its hard to be sure how these interactions will go, although most evidence does seem to point in the direction of lower alcohol consumption.<p>Source: <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/05/marijuana-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/01/05/marijuana-much-more-tha...</a>",1393139662
