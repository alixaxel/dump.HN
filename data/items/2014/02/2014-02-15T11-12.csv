With shadow DOM, you replace &#x27;native button here&#x27; nodes by trees of nodes (&#x27;rounded rect with text inside it&#x27;) that can be individually styled.<p>If you store those shadow DOM trees in the full page hierarchy, any JavaScript that walks the tree must inspect every node for its &#x27;part of shadow DOM&#x27; bit (code that asks for all div&#x27;s shouldn&#x27;t see any div&#x27;s in the shadow DOM) That slows down those walks. If you store them outside of the full hierarchy, your rendering code (which must walk the shadow DOM nodes) must know to inspect each node to see whether it has a shadow DOM tree. That slows down rendering.<p>On top of that, more code = more cache misses, more code = less room for user data, and your nodes likely will grow a bit in size (at least on average) if you add that &#x27;part of shadow DOM&#x27; bit.<p>I don&#x27;t have the faintest idea how large the effect of all this is, but there will be an effect.",1392464342

Do you agree?<p>>I question the W.H.O. methodology, which has serious problems with data reliability and the standards of comparison. A study I would take more seriously is one published last year by Ellen Nolte and Martin McKee in the journal Health Affairs. They examined avoidable mortality — that is, deaths whose risk of occurrence would be far lower if the population had access to appropriate health care interventions. In that study, based on data for the year 2000, France was also ranked No. 1, with the lowest rate of avoidable deaths. The United States was last, in 19th place, with the highest rate of avoidable deaths. That’s a severe indictment of our health care system in my judgment and calls attention, quite justifiably, to the high performance of the French health care system.<p><a href=""http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/health-care-abroad-france/#h[IqtTas,2,3]"" rel=""nofollow"">http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/health-car...</a>",1392464122
