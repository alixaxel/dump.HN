The publishers and the governments set the rules.<p>>> Think of a paper book suddenly becoming illegal (regardless of its contents) as soon as it crosses some border.<p>One of the principal jobs of US Customs is seizing illegal books and other items that infringe on copyright, trademark, and patent privileges.<p>The Supreme Court recently reversed precedent to allow importation of textbooks that are legally published under license from US publishers. Until then, it was presumptively illegal and the court gave publishers a simple formula to make it illegal again. [0] It&#x27;s also not legal to import items --presumably including books -- that may have trademarked logos imprinted on them without the consent of the trademark holder and those trademarks can be used to prevent importation of items (e.g. watches or books) whose function is unrelated to the trademark itself. [1]<p>>> Sticking to old rules and regulations that fail to catch-up with progress won&#x27;t solve any problem.<p>It solves the problem where the people enforcing those rules can put you in jail.<p>>> I also think consumers should aim to acquire media that is not bound to the delivery mechanism.<p>Say goodbye to the cloud. Actually, that&#x27;s not such a bad idea. [2] It sure limits your ability to access media, though. And subjects you to a lot of border searches.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtsaeng_v._John_Wiley_%26_Sons,_Inc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirtsaeng_v._John_Wiley_%26_Son...</a>.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_S.A._v._Costco_Wholesale_Corp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_S.A._v._Costco_Wholesale_...</a>.<p>[2] <a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus/apmlngnhgbnjpajelfkmabhkfapgnoai?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cloud-to-butt-plus...</a>",1391965134

Only later did we all learn that: 1) His roles weren&#x27;t as important or high-ranking as he claims and 2) He was fired for non-performance from his last two positions. Both of those points are becoming big thorns in our fundraising as investors want to speak with both founders&#x27; former bosses.<p>This co-founder did work hard for a brief period when the company was started and managed to produce some good initial funding. But when the funding hit our bank, he became a victim of his own success and spent more time empire building than working on the company. Within months of our initial funding he was already working his way into adviser positions with local startups and spending our marketing budget on having a PR firm get puff-piece articles about him into major publications. I think he&#x27;s spent less than a thousand dollars on customer acquisition and advertising for our product.<p>He rarely comes in to the office any more, and when he does he can often be found watching ESPN or Hulu in the conference room.

A bad co-founder isn&#x27;t immediately obvious. In this case, the person in question is charismatic and persistent when necessary, and has a great ability to sell himself to others in the short term as long as you don&#x27;t dig too deep in to his spotty past.

It&#x27;s true that he didn&#x27;t explicitly give evidence for that, but expecting writers to justify every single statement in a short piece that is one of many they write on a topic is another refuge of bullshitters.

Bullshitters use that claim because it&#x27;s a vague, hard-to-verify positive claim that can be made about almost any market activity.<p>He does support the implied assertion that the claim is bullshit in this case.

It seems crazy to me to have four sig figs of reliability for designs that were basically at the PowerPoint stage.<p>NASA started with the requirement that their new rocket have less than 1 in 1000 odds of loss of crew (LOC). They concluded that using an existing Atlas V had LOC odds of 1 in 957 (unacceptable), while the paper design of putting a capsule on top of a Shuttle booster had LOC odds of 1 in 1918 (totally acceptable). They then quoted this 1,918 number in a lot of places to justify the program.<p>This rocket was the Ares-I [2], which turned into a fiasco and was canceled four years ago.<p>My conclusion is that NASA&#x27;s current risk assessments are as bogus as the ones for the space shuttle. They start with an unrealistic goal (1 in 1000 risk), make totally unjustifiable estimates to meet the goal, and then make bad decisions based on these estimates. Coincidentally, the decisions based on these estimates line up with the politically-desirable outcome.<p>The 1 in 1918 risk assessment turned out to be totally wrong, of course.

There are cases, however, where we do add security barriers to them so there are reasons why having this as a layer in the db can be a good thing.<p>Let&#x27;s take an example:  separation of duties in accounting.  You want someone to enter transactions and you want someone else to approve them, and you want to enforce this through db permissions.<p>You might give insert permissions to user 1 but update permissions to user 2.  Except that you don&#x27;t want to allow updates.  You only want to allow some updates, to a few columns.<p>So now you grant update permissions only on some columns.  Except that you don&#x27;t want to allow all updates on those columns.  You only want to allow updating from, say, a null value to a definite value (say, indicating who and when).<p>You can&#x27;t do this with standard permissions, so you now create another role with permission to update these columns, and require that mere mortals go through a stored procedure to update them, which will only allow those rows to be updated which had nulls in these values.<p>Now, I hear you say, you could do this with a join table called &#x27;approval&#x27; with these columns so you don&#x27;t have to worry about NULLs.  Great, except that NOT EXISTS() queries tend to suck and you can&#x27;t use partial indexes to ensure you can always quickly look up those transactions pending approval.  So in the end NULLs, stored procedures, and an intermediate role end up winning out in terms of security.",1391962091

7205877,comment,7205385,7205830,4,0,weland,,,"> It&#x27;s perfectly acceptable to not understand the low level details of seriously used systems.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s what my colleagues thought a few months ago, too, when they churned up a web UI for an embedded device. My teamwork was, apparently, insufficient to make them realize that a configuration interface that takes half the available flash space is rather large (the other half was taken by a goddamn kernel, a web server, a proxy server, a bunch of other networking tools, a logging service and all the tools that communicated with the web ui!). Lack of understanding regarding how routing works in TCP/IP networks also meant that their first attempt had a pretty fatal flaw which resulted in the configuration interface becoming inaccessible, which became apparent in the first ten minutes of testing and required a significant amount of redesign because the entire workflow of the interface depended on that.<p>Their Bootstrap wizardry was remarkable, but ignoring how the underlying system worked resulted in them having to start from scratch.<p>It works the other way &#x27;round, too. Not understanding how web tools work would also make my systems programming entirely useless when it has to provide the infrastructure on which such tools rely.<p>No one likes all this complexity. I hate it, too. I sometimes truly, really wish my job was as simple as taking this thing from here and putting it over there. Ignoring this complexity doesn&#x27;t make it go away though; building tools that can isolate <i>some</i> of it behind a comprehensive and consistent interface is ok, but relying on those tools to do it for you without understanding what they do is technical suicide. It&#x27;s this kind of thinking that makes people think it&#x27;s ok for a rudimentary word processor to take six fucking seconds to load, after asking you for a password, in 2014, on a quad-core system.<p>Edit: it&#x27;s also worth pointing out that this is really beyond the scope of the article&#x27;s argument. What the article insists is that this:<p><pre><code>    var numbers = [7, 8, 1, 3, 2, 7, 6];\n    numbers.sort();\n</code></pre>\nhardly helps anyone learn coding as a problem solving tool. This exercise taught the reader exactly nothing about how to solve the problem of sorting numbers. I could ask someone who works for me to sort me those numbers, and my understanding about algorithmic thinking would be as rudimentary as before.<p>Teaching children how to use calculators does not increase their problem-solving ability, not by an iota. <i>Teaching them mathematics</i> does that, and their ability is further advanced when they learn about theorems and structuring proofs, about induction and, yes, about using a calculator.<p>It&#x27;s the same here. I&#x27;m not arguing that computer science should be purist to the extent that you shouldn&#x27;t use anything but a Number 2 pencil to program. That&#x27;s stupid. I am arguing, though, that teaching people &quot;to code&quot;, as if programming consisted in nothing but translating from English to Codese, is pretty much as retarded as teaching mathematics as if it were a language, consisting of nothing other than translating the English &quot;Two apples and three apples make how many apples?&quot; into the far more cryptic &quot;2 + 3 = ?&quot;.",1391961878

Any discussion was impossible with them. So let me explain a bit...<p>In this case, VLC just uses the Windows APIs (DirectSound), and sends signed integers of 16bits (s16) to the Windows Kernel.<p>VLC allows amplification of the INPUT above the sound that was decoded. This is just like replay gain, broken codecs, badly recorded files or post-amplification and can lead to saturation.<p>But this is exactly the same if you put your mp3 file through Audacity and increase it and play with WMP, or if you put a DirectShow filter that amplifies the volume after your codec output.\nFor example, for a long time, VLC ac3 and mp3 codecs were too low (-6dB) compared to the reference output.<p>At worse, this will reduce the dynamics and saturate a lot, but this is not going to break your hardware.<p>VLC does not (and cannot) modify the OUTPUT volume to destroy the speakers. VLC is a Software using the OFFICIAL platforms APIs.<p>The issue here is that Dell sound cards output power (that can be approached by a factor of the quadratic of the amplitude) that Dell speakers cannot handle. Simply said, the sound card outputs at max 10W, and the speakers only can take 6W in, and neither their BIOS or drivers block this.<p>And as VLC is present on a lot of machines, it&#x27;s simple to blame VLC. &quot;Correlation does not mean causation&quot; is something that seems too complex for cheap Dell support...<p>Maybe Dell should advise against playing Metal music and should only allow Céline Dion music, because Metal saturates more...<p>EDIT: more details...<p>PS: they even provide a BIOS update for the fix... So, of course, VLC was the issue... <a href=""http://www.dell.com/support/troubleshooting/us/en/04/KCS/KcsArticles/ArticleView?c=us&l=en&s=bsd&docid=557836"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dell.com/support/troubleshooting/us/en/04/KCS/Kcs...</a>",1391961839

So starting a deep dive with Computer Science with 7th and 8th graders is a fools errand.<p>But it is a worth while endeavour to show them the mechanical side of coding. They will eat that up.
