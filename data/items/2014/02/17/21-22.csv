7254781,comment,7254276,7254276,9,0,crystaln,,,"Presumably you mean gross margin, calculated as revenue less cost of goods and excluding payment fees.<p>For a $100 sale that costs $75 (a 25% gross margin, typical for internet sales), and a payment fee of 5%, the fee is $5, or 20% of the $25 gross margin. Each 1% of fees represents 4% of gross margin. That fee will represent a much higher percentage of net profit, after deducting other business costs.<p>This effect increases dramatically as gross margin decreases. At 20% gross margin, 5% represents 25% of margin.<p>For a low margin business, say 10% gross margin, a 5% fee represents 50% of the $10 margin on a $100 sale. If other business costs average $3 on that sale, the payment fee takes out $5 from the $7 margin, or 71%. A 1% decrease in payment fees increases net profit by 50%, from $2 to $3 on that sale.<p>So you can see on low margin business, payment fees have an enormous effect on margins and profitability.",1392674328

7254602,comment,7250505,7252947,3,0,srean,,,"As far as AK-47 goes I think you are conflating two different engineering concepts, perhaps because you are not an engineer. One concept is that of &quot;clearance&quot; as a feature for the designed functionality of a product vs loose tolerance as a result of sloppiness.<p>I think, you think tolerance means fits that rattle, thats not what it means in engineering. Loose tolerance may just as likely lead to interference fits.<p>Forget AK-47, there are more egregious examples, consider the Blackbird, SR-71 one of the fastest military aircrafts to have graced the skies, a marvel of engineering: it had just wide gaps between the parts of its metallic skin, at the joints. Now going by your logic one might think SR71 became successful because of loose tolerance and &quot;good enough&quot;. It was quite the opposite, the clearances were deliberate and necessary for its success. They were there to account for thermal expansion. For the AK it was necessary for rough use and low to zero maintenance.<p>In fact not having clearance for SR71 or the AK would have constituted intellectual sloppiness: going with cookie cutter decisions and not optimizing the product for the use case. What looks sloppy to an amateur might actually be the result of perfection by an expert.<p>May I recommend Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance to you.<p>Further, I think you are being obtuse and defensive and railing against something I have not said. I am not quite sure why. I have never claimed all products need to be finished to the point of &quot;burnished wood knobs&quot;. My commentary was on personal growth as an engineer. If it doesn&#x27;t bother you somewhere to turn in a product that you know you could improve with little effort, you are not going to be a quality engineer, and will not be able to produce a quality product when one such is desired. I am categorically not saying that each item that you deliver has to be the epitome of some arbitrary quality standard.<p>The cultural tradition that I was talking about was not about adding cost to the product by unnecessary finish. Often people do not finish the product even when it would not have taken much effort. This is rationalized with the logic that the finish would have little immediate value, because it is already good enough for the job, but far from &quot;good&quot;. The other reason is sometimes the craftsman just does not have the skill and &quot;good enough&quot; is a good argument to take cover under.",1392672472

We were 4 people and booked a place with two bedrooms which said it accommodates 4 people. Sounds right.<p>When we showed up at the place, there were just 3 beds - a double bed in one room and a single bed in another.<p>Mind you, this being carnival season and stuff, we were paying a handsome amount for our rental. However, when we got in touch with the host (he lives in the US with his wife, a care taker opened the house for us..) he refused to acknowledge the issue. He said: &quot;There&#x27;s a couch in the living room, one of you can sleep there - that way the house accommodates 4 people&quot;.<p>So we got in touch with AirBNB support who said they would find us another place. Of course they couldn&#x27;t - everything is sold out during carnival. So, they finally decided to refund the &quot;AirBNB fee&quot; to us (about USD 54) so that we could use it to buy an inflatable mattress to put on the floor.<p>I asked them why they couldn&#x27;t give us a full refund considering this was absolutely unacceptable as they should take responsibility for incorrect listings that lead to situations like this. (for what it&#x27;s worth, Expedia, etc. have a far higher standard of customer service when it comes to stuff like this) They replied saying that the host had already been paid out - as if that&#x27;s our problem.. =/<p>Anyway, we had no choice but to stay so we did indeed buy an inflatable mattress...

However, I&#x27;m a full stack engineer who came up from the front-end engineering ranks, and I&#x27;ve successfully gone through two major tech switches (desktop -> web and web -> mobile).<p>The specific tech stack you use as a frontend engineer will almost certainly be obsolete in 5 years.  The general skills you learn as a frontend engineer will not be, and that combination of skills are not taught <i>anywhere</i>, particularly not college.<p>If you&#x27;re doing it right, you learn way more as a FE-SWE than just Javascript.  You learn design concepts like hierarchy, line, typography, color theory, etc.  You learn information architecture and how to present only what the user needs to see at a given time to them.  You learn how to structure a large application through MVC, MVP, component trees, etc.  You learn how to keep it responsive and low-latency.  You learn concurrency and how to deal with user interactions that may occur in the middle of your app doing something.  You learn animation and motion design.  You learn security, input validation, never to trust user input, and how to design the UI so that invalid inputs aren&#x27;t even possible.<p>Those are widely transferrable skills.  As long as there are computers and people who use them, we&#x27;ll need to figure out how to interface between them.  And as more fundamental CS concepts become available to mainstream, non-tech-savvy users, the need for frontend engineering skills only becomes greater (witness companies like GitHub, DropBox, and Twitter, which are based upon bringing UNIX utilities that have existed for 40 years to mainstream audiences).<p>I loved my compiler design and machine architecture courses, but demand for those skills is very specialized, and you have to be very good at it to get a job doing them.

I understand where you are coming from, but am much more pessimistic about the viability of a EFTA-type agreement. In fact, I&#x27;m almost convinced that the EU, as it is today, cannot survive if it is not further integrated.<p>Both these statements of mine hinge on my observation that the strength of a political entity can only be determined at a time of crisis. For instance, the internal economic imbalances of the EU will always make some countries overall net-winners and some net-losers with regards to trade balances. This will inevitably lead to crises.<p>The USA have just as much imbalance between their states as we have between our member states, but they have one thing that we don&#x27;t: Federal redistribution. If you live in Alabama and recieve social aid, get farming subsidies or are employed by the military, that is paid for by the whole, not just by Alabama. So it doesn&#x27;t matter if Alabama is bleeding money in all directions.<p>In the EU, this is not the case.<p>I would thus expect an EFTA-EU to fracture or implode when the economic interests of the &quot;big&quot; countries are not aligned for a prolonged period of time. Nobody wants to live as a net-loser in perpetuity.<p>Also, the EU actually has built-in decentralization! If you look at the contracts, there is ample mention of the &quot;subsidiarity principle&quot; and when you take a look at the legislation, it becomes clear that they actually mean it. There is even some grumbling from the highly-centralized EU states, such as France or Poland, about the increasing significance of the sub-national organizational structures (regions).<p>The democracy thing could be fixed, if the will was there. Assuming, hypothetically, that things continued to go the way they have gone for the last decades, the EU actually will become progressively more democratic. After all, the EU parliament only came into the power it currently has with the Lisbon treaty.<p>If the political will to unite Europe dissapears, the EU will collapse like a house of cards, for all the institutions and legal frameworks it has right now can&#x27;t hold it together alone.",1392671343
