Basically, the reader should be able to get a high-level idea of the applicant by quickly reading the top of each section/subsection, and then dig deeper into whatever they feel is relevant by moving deeper into the &quot;tree&quot;.<p>Anecdotally, when I interview senior level people (data scientists, but this would apply to software engineers too), more than half the resumes are two pages. It&#x27;s not abnormal and by no means a deal-killer. The last guy I interviewed had seven jobs and three degrees crammed into a single page - I had to waste 25% of the interview just asking him what he did at each job because his resume didn&#x27;t tell me (except a title and a really terse summary). This only hurt him because I had less time to build a case to hire him.",1392609496

Stop looking for the one time hit. The odds your startup/project is going to last the long term are probably low, and if you move onto the next thing, you&#x27;ll be in the same spot. Start trying to build an audience around you of people and students who share your world views, and build stuff for them. Blog, write articles, do webcasts, talk at one of the many co-working spaces that look for speakers now.<p>Many people reading this are saying &quot;But I don&#x27;t know anything to teach.&quot; That&#x27;s ridiculous. You just learned something last week that someone still doesn&#x27;t know. I was teaching an entire Freshman Chemistry class as a Senior. There were juniors doing it. Sure, I took the class myself, but I didn&#x27;t think I knew it well enough to even teach them. But I did the work to prepare, and teaching made me learn it backwards and forwards. Teaching isn&#x27;t just good for the student; it&#x27;s good for you.<p>&quot;What is obvious to you is obvious to you&quot; -John Medina (author of BabyBrainRules).<p>There is so much you know that someone else would love to acquire.<p>2) User testing. Get some beta testers simply by paying some people to use your app. (Read: Don&#x27;t Make Me Think) I got some early folks on Usertesting.com. They were invaluable in finding problems and providing feedback in way you just don&#x27;t get from some comments on a forum or thread about your product.<p>3) Go do some volunteer/non-profit work for 2 hours a week. Join something that has a big group of people you can help out and commit to for awhile. You&#x27;ll quickly find when you start working for groups have a cause much bigger than you, you make a lot of new friends. And when you help them out, they love helping you out. You&#x27;ll have these new groups to reach out to kick around new ideas. And they are the first ones spreading your stuff. Even better if you can find some groups to help with stuff you are building, but definitely not required to get some great benefits.",1392609220

But keep in mind that when this interview was conducted TSLA was trading at $30 a share and was finally starting to look promising after a few years of near bankruptcy and failure, but wasn&#x27;t quite the Wall Street darling that it is today.  More recent comments indicate that he will be with the company for at least another 5 years[2].  The talks with apple appear to have happened somewhere in between these two interviews.  It&#x27;s entirely possible that Apple and Elon were simply discussing partnership opportunities.  But it&#x27;s not too far fetched to think that after 8 years of near failure, Musk was considering cashing out.  Tesla&#x27;s recent momentum might have given him a second wind, but in the end, SpaceX is his real baby.<p>As an aside, after hearing the Pando Daily interview, it never occurred to me that Elon would sell out his stake in Tesla.

7250503,comment,7247600,7250314,1,0,morphle,,,"I will try to be succinct here, but that is hard to do on the spur of this moment. I must refer to my scientific papers (see my HN profile for email address) where I had a few months to describe it right. Indeed, the website is being worked on while I write this, we are just coming out of stealth mode next week.<p>Our hardware switches are to build true mesh networks at hardware encrypted linespeeds up to 800 Gbps (Q1 2014).<p>Currently, most ISP and end-user routers and switches are set up behind NAT and with default routes in an hierarchical star topology, all pointed (slaved) to the central ISP. Only that ISP has true internet that they buy or peer with other ISP&#x27;s and the top tier 1 global internet backbones. None of these users, worldwide 99.9% or more, can be considered to be in a mesh network. This is why the [No Such Agency] and governments only need to copy or deep packet inspect at a few points to see most worldwide internet traffic. Most of that traffic is not encrypted at one end, like the ISP or website side you are using. Peer to peer traffic is not yet using strong encryption or is not anonymous. Except Tor tunnels are, but that is slow and is under attack from the NSA and many national firewalls. Open Libernet only proposes to incentivize such a tor-like tunnel system, but do not claim Tor strength anonymity or security. BTW, I exchanged email with the Open Libernet authors, they are computer scientist with master degrees from Beirut.<p>Our system we designed over the last 20 years is based on a home switch with 8 ports at 1 to 3 Gbps, either gigabit copper, wifi or optical (or any connection including your radio and free space optics) would connect you to neighbors to the left, right, behind you, before you and wireless, at $50 mass produced ($200 for 8 ports at 10G). More importantly, it is free and open source hardware based on our own free and open source manycore microprocessors with free and open source software based on the new open openflow standards, so hackers, scientist and anyone can trust the encryption at linespeeds in these mesh switches and routers by constantly scrutinizing . The protocol we are making is similar to TOR, but always at linespeed. If you&#x27;re house injects traffic, it is replacing less critical encrypted bittorrent or dummy traffic, in such a way that no change in bandwidth or content can be detected, providing you with even better anonymity than Tor does. It brings anonymous bittorrent and voice/email/skype-like traffic. The 60 manycore processor must be always on so your home router will pass on traffic from you neighbors in trade for them passing on your traffic. This allows the switch/router to also function as (web)server. One of the services will be an anonymous distributed cloud service, based on free cores and any terabyte harddisks you share by connecting to the switch. Most importantly, although you can run Unix/linux on the some cores, the switch and openflow protocols do not. This allows hardware protection of the e-capabilities that guard the free and open source encryption algorithms, so it is [No Such Agency] strength security. Linux, Intel and Arm processors has to many unknown security flaws and known backdoors and are not truly open hardware and software. We should be much more secure than Tor or Freedombox this way, although we do run these free software systems as well.<p>So now you have a secure anonymous free and open source mesh network that is running at hardware speeds, preferably over optical fibers, within your neighborhoods and not in the hand of any company or government you can not trust. You can at any time check the software and hardware if it still can be trusted. Your neighbors are by default incentivized (forced by social peer pressure) to also get a mesh router and more importantly, to keep it always on. By adding and sharing harddisks, they gain a shared petabyte anonymous cloud storage. By having a core surplus in the encrypting switch, the are further paying for the shared cloud services running distributed on their home switches/server. By using our built-in manycore parallelism, they are incentivized further to not rely on Linux encryption, but our microcode/bytecode based encryption that has no backdoors and can be constantly be checked for it.\nSo mesh every aspect, not just the tunnels. Incentivize everyone, so they must peer with each other to gain high speed at zero or lowest cost. Keep it out of the control of a single provider, so it will remain free and open, right up to the continental crossing points and beyond. It must be crowd funded, by the richest most powerful group on the planet, we the people who should hold these anonymity, privacy and mesh peering/sharing truths to be self evident.\nI hope I made it clear you should mesh at every level and provide all that without end-users installing a single thing. They should not want to turn of the devices, ever. So make it very low power.<p>Next these neighborhoods need to have a mesh network with each other, city to city. So they should share the cost of private fibers between cities, also running the same strength encryption as the home routers but now at terabits speeds per fiber. They need to hook up through submarine cables with other continents, again with the same free and open hardware switches running at multiple terabits. That is why we design and built the entire system from scratch with the latest and best hardware, software and encryption systems science can come up with. At the internet exchanges, this local or global mesh network also peers with the current internet, where you will loose some or all encryption if you do not terminate with peers using the same mesh protocols or travel thru big companies or government networks.\nThis is why we not just built mesh networks locally and have them financed and owned by the users themselves, but also provide community owned inter-city and inter-continental mesh fiber nets that do not fall under government laws or investor control.<p>We welcome developers, scientist, Phd students and HN type co-founders to work with or for us to build out this system to regain anonymity and privacy while providing gigabit+ speeds. We welcome ISP&#x27;s and communities to use our open hardware and backbone at cost.<p>Edited for errors.",1392607881

Posting on Reddit and HN is good to create discussion or buzz, but it won&#x27;t by itself get you sales.<p>Another thing I would recommend is that you do two things:<p>1.  Write a marketing plan.  Talk about the market, who you are going for, and how you will reach them.  Discuss both PR and advertising, as well as other forms of outreach.  Review it, write it as a team.  Get everyone on the same page.<p>2.  Then once that is done, put it on the shelf and don&#x27;t look at it for a year.  Act as if the plan doesn&#x27;t exist.  Go out and promote your product.
