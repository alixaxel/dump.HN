7250062,comment,7248307,7249984,1,0,Wintamute,,,"You&#x27;ve missed my point, and resorted to ad hominem. Way to go. I&#x27;m not saying that the little things aren&#x27;t important, its great to be a perfectionist and I think sites are absolutely built out of details by designers and developers working in respectful partnership. But my point is that the design details that should be obsessed over come way before the traditional pixel pushing session at the end of the job. Things like consistent, simple and really robust visual relationships between components and typography across devices and viewport sizes. In my experience this is where good designers spend their energies - and if its done well pixel pushing should not be required.<p>I just responded to the point you were making in a polite manner, without calling you immature or calling your professional experience into question. Now do you fancy having a go?",1392598740

7250057,comment,7249926,7249926,1,0,informatimago,,,"That depends on the target tool for those translations.<p>The file formats for translation files for MacOSX/iOS (.strings files), for Android (strings.xml files), for Linux (.po files), and a multitude of other development environments, are all different.<p>If one was to provide a tool for translators to work on this kind of translations, what one could do is to keep the translations in a database (original string/language, translated string/language), and have little tools to convert the various file format into and out of the database.<p>Using a database would help recalling common strings.<p>Now, in translating interfaces, not only strings need to be translated.  If only, for some interface definitions take human input to adjust widget size according to the text (which is of different size in the different language), but also because translating involves more than just the text.  Right-to-left script systems may need different layouts than left-to-right script systems.  Icons may need to change according to the culture relative to the language. (And data may need to be computed or formatted differently according to the language, but this is for the developers to care about).<p>Therefore beyond the translation of strings, a UI translator will need to master the development tools used to edit the interface layouts (Xcode on MacOSX or iOS, eg. eclipse on Android, etc), to be able to provide a comprehensive translation service.<p>Perhaps considering some professional tool already developed would be a good idea? <a href=""http://kilgray.com/webshop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kilgray.com/webshop/</a>",1392598548

I wonder if the lines have to be so solid, or if a similar effect could be accomplished without breaking the image so much.<p>Would a bunch of almost imperceptible lines work? What about a smallish change in colour saturation or similar?\nreply<p><i>gojomo 8 days ago | link</i><p>I was wondering the same thing. Might a finer mesh/grid work? Or bars with some dimensional shading themselves? Or slight transparency?<p>Could the bars/layer even be animated, along some consistent plane, so that there&#x27;s no static background part of the scene that&#x27;s always obscured. (That might allow even thicker bars, if that&#x27;s otherwise helpful for the plane-of-reference establishing effect, but which aren&#x27;t as distracting, since the mind&#x27;s persistence will &#x27;see around&#x27; them.)<p>Combining these, maybe there could be more than one synthetic depth plane active at once, distinguished by color, translucence, or direction-of-motion?

Almost all of my friends who have played it love it, and have gone on to try (and enjoy) other German-style games. Catan is nice because it&#x27;s sufficiently more complex (and well-designed) than Monopoly so as to be interesting, but not so complex that the rules take ages for newcomers to learn (as is often the case with many more complicated games).<p>My personal favorite at the moment is Through the Ages[1], though I&#x27;m also a fan of Puerto Rico[2], as it&#x27;s a rare example of a good game that has (almost) <i>no</i> random elements to its gameplay, such as rolling dice or shuffling a deck. (There is <i>one</i> set of tiles that is shuffled, but it&#x27;s rather inconsequential and could easily be made deterministic if desired).<p>Here in NYC, there&#x27;s a cafe dedicated to board games and which was funded on Kickstarter[3].

And we played the whole Saturday night, the whole Sunday... And when we woke up on Monday, we went to buy the game.<p>We were so into it that the three of us couldn&#x27;t wait 36 hours or so to buy the game: we had to have it immediately.

If it seems hacky, it&#x27;s also hacky in git.<p>I more meant that it seems hacky to add a feature that&#x27;s mostly-sorta like Git branches to Mercurial now.<p>> Stick with what original? The originals in mercurial are branches (where the branch name is part of the commit metadata and thus of the repository&#x27;s history forever, save for history rewriting) and &quot;anonymous heads&quot;.<p>I meant original as in Git vs Mercurial. Like if you want Git-like branches, then why not just stick with Git?<p>> Erm… you can also clone repositories in git.<p>Yeah, you could, but I&#x27;ve never seen anybody recommend cloning a Git repo on the same computer for the purpose of separating out work from the main branch. At least for a while, this seemed to be widely recommended way of separating code out in Mercurial.<p>Where things get kinda weird - in Git, if you want to commit code somewhere that doesn&#x27;t go into main just yet, there are only 2 options - branches and stash, and stash is explicitly meant to be a very short-term, local thing, since you can&#x27;t really share them easily and they aren&#x27;t really part of the commit hierarchy. That makes things simpler, as you never have to wonder what the right feature to use is for keeping separate work somewhere and sharing it with other people. You can create complex structures with branches, but at least there&#x27;s only one &#x27;type&#x27; of thing to keep track of.<p>I&#x27;m not as familiar with Mercurial, but for ways to keep temporary work somewhere, it seems we have named branches, anonymous branches, bookmarks, cloned repos on the same system, and apparently shelve too. According to this guy[1], the workflows for sharing bookmarks around don&#x27;t seem to be fleshed out all that well either. So how do I know which one to use for what tasks?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kevinberridge.com/2012/05/hg-bookmarks-made-me-sad.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kevinberridge.com/2012/05/hg-bookmarks-made-me-sa...</a>",1392597148
