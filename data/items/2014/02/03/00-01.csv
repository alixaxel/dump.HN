7168292,comment,7166207,7168047,1,0,brc,,,"I knew someone who I have since amateur-psych diagnosed as being psycopathic in part (not a real diagnosis).  I met this person while they were going through a divorce.  We worked together on a few things for a while - charm and glib is a great description.  But I noticed a pattern of having no &#x27;old friends&#x27;, and also appalling treatment of women that went far beyond what someone might classify as &#x27;rebound behaviour&#x27; as behaviour that seemed to take delight in degrading women and a need to find friends who delighted in the retelling.  I moved to distance myself from this person in an unconfrontational way - I assumed they could easily turn violent if provoked.  In the end I was proven correct as they assaulted their own father in a disagreement not long after.  I don&#x27;t know what is going on now, as mutual friends who I knew have also ceased contact.<p>The twist in all this story is that the divorce was initiated by him, not his wife.  She was a nice and very normal person, and to her, staying married and having a father for their child was probably more important.  The point is that many people will try and hold a marriage together for all sorts of reasons.",1391389010

The more conventional approach to 32/64-bit code mixing (e.g. in Debian) is that 32-bit processes use the old x86 ABI, while 64-bit processes use the new x86-64 ABI. The x32 ABI was borne out of people noticing that the x86-64 architecture&#x27;s improvements weren&#x27;t all about 64-bitness, and that some of them were relevant to 32-bit programs too. So it keeps 32-bit pointers, but otherwise uses x86-64 features, so even 32-bit processes can take advantage of running on x86-64 chips (everything except the 64-bit part). Nothing inherently wrong with the idea, but it introduces some new critical codepaths into the kernel that have to be thoroughly tested.",1391387562

Of course that&#x27;s true.<p>- CSS 2 was originally published as a recommendation in 1998. CSS 2.1 was pushed as a recommendation in 2011. Maybe something was wrong?<p>- &quot;Ignored by vendors&quot; is a bit of an understatement, because your &quot;close to 20 years&quot; includes 5 years of the vendor with 90% marketshare not releasing anything at all.<p>- FWIW, what became flexbox was useable (assuming polyfills aplenty) in Firefox and Webkit browsers 5 years ago[1]. It took some time to standardize, but while frustrating in the present, it&#x27;s ok to take time to make sure the spec works, because it will be (in theory) around for quite a while.<p>> <i>It makes it &#x27;easy&#x27; by introducing yet another weird box modelism that doesn&#x27;t really fit anything else that&#x27;s already there</i><p>What many people don&#x27;t appreciate about layout in general (and WRT to the web, dynamic layout in particular), is that it turns out to be difficult (and sometimes extremely computationally expensive) to implement an expressive layout system that does what we intuitively think it should. A good example is word wrapping, which is easy to tell when it &quot;looks right&quot; (at least to a trained eye), was done by hand by many when printing was done more manually, but turns out to be difficult to assign a metric that handles all use cases, especially when you&#x27;re trying to be computationally efficient.<p>Web layout is like a whole set of word wrapping requirements, expected to get along and paint a page in real time. The process that birthed CSS is nowhere near what you&#x27;d turn to if you wanted to develop a cohesive styling whole, but it&#x27;s how history usually plays out. If it&#x27;s any consolation, I personally don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a comprehensive theory of everything for styling anyways, so there are always going to be aspects that need to be learned, not inferred.<p>In any case, flexbox is pretty straightforward if you spend an afternoon with it, just a constraint-based layout system that maps pretty well to how you would describe a layout like that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://infrequently.org/2009/08/css-3-progress/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://infrequently.org/2009/08/css-3-progress/</a>",1391387039

I was trying to point out that in the larger landscape of GC algorithms, the one used by .NET is not that advanced, even though it&#x27;s better than the GC used by common scripting languages.<p>> Also AIUI the only &quot;hard part&quot; of C4 is making sure objects don&#x27;t get modified while they&#x27;re being moved (that&#x27;s what the barrier&#x27;s there to detect) - which isn&#x27;t a problem if everything&#x27;s immutable.<p>Would absolutely everything be immutable? How would you implement lazy evaluation with the correct time complexity?<p>The expensive part of any garbage collector with short pause times is bound to be the read barrier, which is still needed with only immutable data. If the GC is compacting and wants to relocate an object, it has to rewrite all references to point to the new copy of the object.<p>C4 uses a read barrier to enforce the invariant that all references point to the up-to-date copy on a load of a reference, not just on a use of a reference. It relies on its ability to immediately update all references to reuse compacted pages during compaction, which means that gratuitous amounts of free memory are not required (a common problem with moving collectors).<p>You might be able to come up with alternate collector design that uses some of the same ideas as C4 while exploiting immutability, but if you loosen the healing read barrier you weaken your ability to reuse memory and put a bound on memory growth, since a reference to an old copy might always escape to the next round of collection.",1391386086

I slam through as much programming and meetings/conversations as possible in 5 hours, then head out of the office and teach robotics to kids for an hour or so.  Time typically spent dorking around on the internet is reallocated to doing better things in the real world.",1391385770

Launchpad was introduced in 10.7 as an additional way to browse and launch apps, making things more familiar to people who&#x27;d only used iOS. The previous methods, like apps in the dock (introduced with OS X) the applications folder (every Mac OS ever) still work fine.<p>If, at Lion&#x27;s launch, Apple had said &#x27;we think launchpad is so good we&#x27;re going to take away all the other ways of launching apps&#x27;, there would have been a full-scale riot.<p>The problem with the start menu is that millions of people, people who don&#x27;t really know much about computers, or want to know much but have to use one anyway, grew up thinking a start menu is what a computer has. It&#x27;s been there and worked in a similar way since 95 and it&#x27;s disconcerting to find it&#x27;s suddenly disappeared.<p>It&#x27;s not special hate, I love the design language and it&#x27;s great to see Microsoft taking the lead in design values - it&#x27;s just that it is not good enough yet.",1391385693
