7219568,comment,7219015,7219266,1,0,carlio,,,"I normally enjoy reading your posts here but this one I have to say I find a bit gleefully FUD-tastic. Given that you describe BitCoin as &quot;magic Internet money&quot; [0] I can&#x27;t help but feel you simply rejoice in BitCoin failures as vindication of your belief that crytocurrency will never work.<p>There seem to be two prevailing extremes of opinion which appear a lot on Hacker News and many other places, as extremes are wont to do while those in the middle don&#x27;t feel strongly enough to contribute. Those are 1) BitCoin will replace government control of money and fix freedom, dude! and 2) What fucking morons, can&#x27;t wait until you crash and burn.<p>I love this whole thing. It&#x27;s fascinating, it&#x27;s an interesting solution to a problem, and watching DogeCoin take off is fun to watch. In my opinion, BitCoin is kind of like when a naïve programmer decides to rewrite an existing library themselves, and comes up against the brutal reality that led the original developers to the compromises and apparently necessary hacks to get the thing working. The analogy here being regulation, insurance, all that jazz. It&#x27;s educational, and I haven&#x27;t been this interested in a technology for a while.<p>I&#x27;m picking on your reply here because it is one of many that exemplifies a &quot;haha told you so&quot; rather than really digging into the interesting technical and sociological aspects.<p>* Message IDs from one API do not equate to IDs from the other, so your example is a bit flawed; there&#x27;s no way to check with Twilio <i>except</i> the ID.<p>* Is &quot;ID&quot; even the term used? I don&#x27;t know for sure, but &quot;Tx Hash&quot; seems to be more widely spread. [Edit: patio11 edited his comment while I was typing mine; I withdraw this point!]<p>* &quot;It&#x27;s on our wiki noob&quot; - someone running the 3rd largest exchange should hardly be a &quot;noob&quot;<p>* &quot;O(n) scan of all transactions globally&quot; - that&#x27;s not particularly hard, nor is it necessary (why scan all transactions from all time?), nor is it unexpected (the entire thing requires everyone to have the complete ledger, so you have the data anyway)<p>There are valid points to be made that the BitCoin protocol needs improvements, and these are even acknowledged by the core devs. This whole situation is a bit ludicrous. But I wish we were talking about &quot;what have we learned&quot;, not &quot;told you so&quot;.<p>When it comes to BitCoin, the conversation seems to be full of radicals and optimists when success happens, and gloaters when it doesn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t feel either add to the conversation, we could be talking about how to improve this as a currency or (as I believe the long term actual application to be) how this can influence distributed trust, especially important in the current climate.<p>[0] <a href=""https://twitter.com/patio11/status/431347845031940096"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/patio11/status/431347845031940096</a>",1392145197

7219565,comment,7219015,7219412,9,0,rtpg,,,"Because in the real world there&#x27;s a huge amount of information asymmetry. Because most consumers are not informed (not because they don&#x27;t put the effort but sinmply because they can&#x27;t just look at the bank&#x27;s books and decide whether they&#x27;re well off), this asymmetry greatly affects a consumers decision to choose &quot;correctly&quot;: it&#x27;s not really a free market.<p>Obviously it depends on the regulations, but a lot of regulations are about making sure that there&#x27;s at least a minimum bound in the &quot;quality&quot; of products offered, because of the asymmetry at play here. If there is none, we can end up with &quot;bad&quot; products(that don&#x27;t seem bad because we&#x27;re uninformed) crowding out &quot;good&quot; ones, and having the entire market be worse off.<p>The 2007 crisis was a perfect example of asymmetry causing markets to crash: obviously there&#x27;s the whole aspect of consumers being mislead on their mortgages, but there&#x27;s the even greater aspects of banks misleading each other! Because of the opacity of the market of derivatives (nobody knew just how invested everyone was in on certain obligations) no bank could make informed decisions on what to do with their positions.<p>If we don&#x27;t restrict some choices in the short term, then we can end up with no choices in the long term. In areas of extremely high uncertainty, regulation (notably concerning transparency) is necessary to make the market freer (in the actual definition, not from the common usage of free=no regulation).",1392145158

The Soviet people did this in spite of Stalin&#x27;s incompetence and some stupid strategic moves that he made.<p>It is really a stupid move to equate a people with the person who happens to be holding the current position of power. Do you equate Ukraine with Yanukovitch? Probably not. Then why would you equate the Soviet Union with Stalin or equate Russia with Putin or the USA with Obama. In all these countries there are many, many actors. Yes Stalin did pull many of the strings in the Soviet Union, to the extent that any person in power can pull strings.<p>But remember that old Chinese saying that the mountains are high and the emperor is far away? That applies to any large country, and it means that Stalin controlled far less than people attribute to him.<p>Of course, in modern times it means that Obama, Yanukovich and Putin also control a lot less than most commentators would claim. For instance I recently read a news piece in which it claimed that Putin ordered Russian troops into Georgia. In fact, the president of Russia at the time, Dmitri Medvedev ordered the troops in. And someone claimed that Putin is responsible for killing stray dogs in Sochi. In fact it is the town mayor and city council that is responsible. Many Russians are aghast and have mounted a campaign to move dogs around so that the killers can&#x27;t find them, and have also set up several dog shelters to feed (and neuter) the dogs. Putin has nothing to do with any of this. It is part of the swirling of events in a complex society.<p>All world events like WWII are the same and anyone who digs in the details learns that the notable figures (generals, presidents, etc) are really just politicians who claim responsibility for the work of other people. These so-called great leaders alternate between urging their henchmen to carry out some action, and running to the front of the parade over which they have no control.

7219349,comment,7216471,7216471,2,0,kumph,,,"This gave me a chance to collect my thoughts. I sent the following email to my representatives. Thanks, Sina, for your role in organizing this.<p>---<p>I think I understand what is going on. The folks at the top look at all the huge centralized information stores like Facebook, Google, Verizon, etc., and I guess they think, &quot;well, it&#x27;s gonna get collected anyway, so we may as well have access to it.&quot; President Obama actually hinted at this line of thinking when initially caught off-guard by the Snowden revelations. Instead of responding directly, he deflected, suggesting that what we really needed was a larger conversation about mass collection of data, i.e. not just the collection by governments.<p>The trouble with mass data collection, either by governments or private entities, is that it gives the possessors of such information extreme amounts of power. Left unchecked, it will almost certainly lead to severe economic and political corruption. The free market is compromised when a small group of people can spy on the private communications of executives and other business people, for example by stealing trade secrets or conducting insider trading. Meanwhile, democracy is compromised when politically active people, including politicians and activists, are made subject to intense scrutiny. Since virtually no one is totally free from legal or moral wrongdoing, the possibilities for politically motivated blackmail and retaliation are massive. And of course the data collection has serious chilling effects on free speech and freedom of the press.<p>If no course correction is made, the U.S. will become more and more oligarchic, more and more like China and Russia. This is unfortunate not just for its implications vis-a-vis individual freedom, but also from a larger perspective. This century we are faced with a diverse array of extremely difficult problems: economic, political, social, and environmental. Non-democratic governments have a historical tendency to fight with one another rather than cooperate, so it is hard to imagine how we will effectively confront these problems in the absence of strong democratic institutions.<p>What worries me is that some of the people in positions of power may actually believe that this massive data collection is somehow necessary to protect Americans from terrorism. But it is patently obvious that terrorism is not, and never has been, a serious threat to the personal safety of most Americans. Over the past two decades, something on the order of 800,000 men, women and children have died in car crashes, while around 3,000 have died as a result of terrorism. If this were a matter of saving lives, we&#x27;d be much better off fighting a &quot;War on Car Crashes&quot; than a &quot;War on Terrorism.&quot; If this is purportedly an economic issue, i.e. the fear that a dirty bomb will go off in Manhattan and upset commerce, well, the fact is much worse things have happened (i.e. Hiroshima) and economies have recovered. This perspective may sound cynical, but in truth it is idealistic. I am not dismissing the tragedy of the death of perhaps thousands of people, but rather saying that, for the sake of a free and democratic society, such sacrifice is worthwhile.<p>The idea that &quot;collection is going to happen anyway, so we may as well have access&quot; is not unreasonable, but it is ultimately self-defeating. What we need is real leadership on this problem. Not only is there no strong voice against mass data collection, but the overwhelming thrust of the government is to reach its tentacles as deeply into the data gathering machine as possible. Instead of working to lessen the danger, the government is acting to accentuate it, amassing and centralizing even more data, and meanwhile using its media access to legitimize such activities to the public.<p>Again, what is needed is strong leadership. We need a group of people at the highest levels of federal power to put up a fight in congress and explain clearly to the American people why, in fact, we are on a very dangerous road. If not corrected for, this road will lead to the end of the democratic experiment, and a very uncertain future for our children. I hope that you, as my elected representative, will seriously consider taking a stand on this issue.",1392143633

Probably the biggest and most visible pain point of missing generics is here: <a href=""http://golang.org/pkg/container/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://golang.org/pkg/container/</a> In particular, the pain point is that there aren&#x27;t very many things there.<p>Missing generics does not mean that no alternate data structures ever get written; as you can see, there are three of them there, which is greater than zero. However, it <i>does</i> mean they are more painful to use, consistently, everywhere, and no matter how much we&#x27;d all like to pretend we are infinitely disciplined programmers, pain matters, and in practice programmers visibly shy away from harder things. It is simply a fact that we must deal with. Generics missing from the language are a problem because it means that doing the right thing is harder than doing the wrong thing of just, say, using the wrong data structure because it&#x27;s more convenient. A language (or an API or a library) should make right things easier and wrong things harder; it is a legit criticism when the right thing is impossible and the wrong thing (extensive copy & paste) is the only choice.<p>Maps & slices are great and all, but they do not correctly cover all use cases, and the sort of servers that Go is otherwise very suitable for is also exactly where you might end up needing something other than those two things for performance reasons.<p>I&#x27;m living without generics in Go, of course, because everyone programming in Go is.

Different people have differing opinions about what should be national policy vs. state policy, and it can actually be counter-intuitive/paradoxical until you really look into it.<p>For example, most American conservatives favor strong national defense, but minority pockets of conservative areas are strongly anti-federal and favor local militias. It seems odd, but you&#x27;ll find that most of that bent veer that way from both the Constitutional right to bear arms in a well regulated militia (unspecified as to who regulates it, but that&#x27;s a small technical quibble), combined with an American leeriness about government (that the same amendment seems to voice) and you can kind of see how that kind of thing arises.<p>And there&#x27;s similar sentiments all over the political spectrum.<p>As an American, the E.U. looks similar in this respect. Politics are tied up in originator theories (the E.U. was meant for xxx) and a European nation vs. local nationalism. With Europe being perceived as being very liberal from an American perspective, it&#x27;s interesting to see politics that would be framed here as extreme conservatism as part of the normal modern European political debate and it&#x27;s a good lesson that not everybody is wholly liberal or conservative on all issues.<p>As to what I support, this current overly complicated system, of overlapping but non-equal areas of trade, borders and monetary systems (the EEA, EU, ESDP, EFTA, EuroZone, Schengen, and on and on and on) seems unsustainable in the long-term.<p>It simply makes more sense to say &quot;if you&#x27;re in Europe, you are part of the EU which implies you are part of common defense, common trade, common monetary policy and so and so forth&quot; and not worry about which part of the venn diagram a particular nation is. My prediction is that this <i>will</i> happen within the next 50 years. And 50 years after than everybody will look back and wonder what all the fuss was about.<p>From an outsider&#x27;s perspective, Europe today is better than Europe was even just a couple decades ago and I think it&#x27;s largely due to this unification movement. Having a larger government override local concerns seems particularly difficult for Europeans right now, but as an American we&#x27;re quite used to it and find it <i>generally</i> tolerable.<p>As a frequent visitor to Europe over the last few decades, I enjoy the more unified Europe more, it&#x27;s just easier to get around and do things, even if some of the local flavor has been lost (I used to love collecting all the various currencies, now it&#x27;s just Euros, bleh).",1392142414

These kinds of movements make everyone involved feel good and I do not deny this campaign is for a cause the participants feel is just...I agree in principal. However, joining another mineable database feels like doing the same thing that we are talking about curtailing, with the added potential of making participants part of a larger target if anyone threatened decides to go on the offensive. Legislators only listen to the hoi polloi when reading scripts in front of cameras or they are drumming up votes for the next election. Even more pertinent, the corporate environment that exists in the Western world has morphed to influence our every waking moment and would never allow an organized collective get too big or gain too much traction before well-publicized character attacks and disinformation fill the airwaves(or the startup is &#x27;incorporated&#x27;). The status quo owns the media(even Reddit), the &#x27;tubez(backbone) & most western governments(lobbying is corruption, whatever the laws have been tailored to say), thus they have the loudest message and currently control all infrastructure in this global society(think &#x27;good ol boy&#x27; network rather than conspiracy theory). The antagonists and would-be &#x27;movements&#x27; of late are diminishing from the public consciousness faster than other entities can make noticeable ripples: Wikileaks, Occupy Wall Street, Manning, Snowden...

Adding sentience to the equation has potential to improve the human race above limbic compulsions but so far has only worked to increase the polarization to meet the desires of the controlling interests(most powerful? influential? smartest?).<p>I am sentient and have principals I believe in. These principals require me to make sacrifices sometimes, and that includes how I earn & spend my monies. I walked off a job in October that would have multiplied my income by a factor of 10, problem is they asked me to endanger myself, compromise my principals and break some really well-founded national safety codes, never mind the organizations&#x27; &#x27;professed&#x27; safety policies. Instead, I&#x27;m living hand-to-mouth in a shack making a small fraction of my potential earnings and reading/commenting on HN. C&#x27;est la vie, I have made my choices and still sleep really well at night. Of the few dollars I make, I spend them just as judiciously as I earn them. There are unavoidable expenses in a modern society; housing, utilities, food. Other spending may seem crucial, but ultimately distill down to wants or conveniences and I&#x27;ve minimizing or eschewed those, too; ISP, TV signal, formal education. Then, of course, there&#x27;s the disposable income and all that encompasses. How I earn & spend my money(times a factor of a few billion others), this is what drives the world economy and this is what I determined I can influence to create or realize meaningful change within &#x27;my circle of influence&#x27;[1].

7219143,comment,7206637,7212651,1,0,saraid216,,,"> What I&#x27;m getting at is that having a personal vehicle gives a person a lot of choices that are not available to those without personal vehicles and that walkability and public transit are not a viable replacement for vehicle ownership unless one is willing to sacrifice large amounts of time (walking time) and mental energy (working out, in advance, the logistics of your movements for the day/evening in advance in detail).<p>Sure. But what you&#x27;re not detailing are the drawbacks of having a personal vehicle, namely the additional errands piled on from having to maintain it (and its license), the extra space required to store it, the emotional tax of being in traffic, the higher risk of injury, the consequences at a macro-scale.<p>It&#x27;s manifestly unfair to say, &quot;Well, choice!&quot; when both options have drawbacks. Not having a car, for instance, makes it harder to road trip: admittedly not something you do much of in Hong Kong, but it&#x27;s a quintessential American fantasy. I&#x27;d estimate 20% of Americans have lived out of their cars at some point; their experience would not have been better without a car.<p>> Perhaps, from your point of view the reusable shopping bag&#x27;s fixed size serves as an additional constraint on your grocery spending and is helping you to lead a more frugal and focused life.<p>This is overthinking it, in my view. I recognize that I can always make a second trip if I need to, and given that I can <i>literally</i> go to the store twice a day if I actually have the need, it&#x27;s meaningless to worry about buying too many items. &quot;I&#x27;ll go back tomorrow&quot; is a reasonable thought and doesn&#x27;t require justification.<p>It&#x27;s an extra 10 minutes a day to detour through the market, pick up what I need, go through checkout, and be on my way. This is a side effect of not driving; if I drove, I&#x27;d go to the Costco in the other neighborhood, fill up my trunk with bulk purchases (because any less would fail to justify the gas I just spent), and be set for a few months since I&#x27;m living alone.<p>It&#x27;s certainly true that I disagree with rampant consumerism and unintentional obesity. This is something like saying I disagree with providing suicidal people with loaded guns, in order to provide them with choice. The provision of choice is not a binary action: it can be provided in <i>many</i> ways, and you need to choose between those possible actions.<p>In order to argue for cars, you need to do more than argue that they provide choices unavailable to walkers and cyclists. You need to argue that the choices they provide are <i>more important</i> than the choices provided by what a car-less society would look like.",1392142255

Had to register a new account, as I lost the password to my original account a while ago.<p>Addressing a few of the points made in the comments here...<p>> You&#x27;re hypocritical because you just wasted time writing that post<p>This is false. That post took approximately 30-45 minutes to write, and this comment will take me some 15 minutes to write. That&#x27;s an hour at most. I work on <i>many</i> things related to activism in various shapes (to the point where I barely have any real free time), and this is just a tiny drop in the bucket. Comparing that to the fact that the bulk of people participating in the &quot;Day We Fight Back&quot; stuff have that as their <i>only</i> contribution to &#x27;activism&#x27;, this is absolutely not a valid comparison. And no, I&#x27;m not trying to pat myself on the back here - I&#x27;m just trying to show how this post is a result of genuine frustration, and not some random hypocritical rant from somebody lacking self-reflection.<p>> Representatives do listen to calls<p>This is entirely besides the point, and a part of the post actually addresses this. It doesn&#x27;t <i>matter</i> whether representatives are listening to you or not. Even if it might be a theoretical win, in practice you&#x27;re not going to see any results from it. The system that these representatives operate in is inherently flawed in many ways, and for every &quot;theoretical win&quot;, the situation gets worse in ten other ways. I tried to subtly hint at the framework itself needing change, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like people picked this up.<p>> Why are you criticizing when you don&#x27;t even have a solution<p>As said by one (!) commenter below, having a solution is not a prerequisite to criticism - no matter the topic. I understand that some people will want to bring this up as an argument, since it provides a way for them to wave away the bulk of criticism coming their way (after all, criticism <i>usually</i> lacks a solution), but it&#x27;s absolutely vital that you recognize that criticism can and should stand on its own.<p>Yes, I do have some things that I believe are the solution to many of the problems we currently face. No, I do not think they belong in this blog post. No, I definitely don&#x27;t want people to blindly follow those solutions, without thinking through the issues themselves first.<p>> It takes much longer than 4 years to change the world<p>Yes, yes it does. The problem isn&#x27;t that the problems haven&#x27;t been solved yet, the problem is that we&#x27;re still stuck at the <i>exact same stage</i>, with no sign of progress. It&#x27;s like a toy robot whirring against the stairs - you could argue that eventually he&#x27;ll arrive at the top, but in practice that&#x27;s never going to happen, no matter how long you wait. Four years is more than enough to evaluate whether a strategy is going to have an effect, and it&#x27;s the evaluation (and subsequent conclusion) that&#x27;s lacking here.<p>> An event like this also killed SOPA<p>It didn&#x27;t. All it did was cause an outrage, and push it ahead a bit. If anything, it gave rise to even worse proposals.

Feinstein, to lead a revolt against her would require finding someone from within SF progressive circles who is willing to vote similarly to her in so many other areas, and I can&#x27;t imagine anyone with such juice - Barbara Boxer poses the same problem.  Neither of them is likely to lose their seats anytime soon.<p>Fighting back isn&#x27;t about getting what we want today, it&#x27;s about being on a road for it.  In your community, wherever you live, there are probably a handful of issues that overwhelmingly drive each election.  This is true most places.  It&#x27;s important to make sure that Internet Freedom ranks alongisde things like Worker&#x27;s rights, Women&#x27;s rights, Immigration Reform, etc..<p>It&#x27;s important that the next generation of politicians have no choice but to address this as part of their platform.<p>While I really like the fiery call to action another commenter made about &quot;nailing their scalp to the wall&quot; with anyone who supports this, it&#x27;s very clearly a generational problem.  I think a lot of damage could be done to unseat someone like Feinstein or Boxer who do good jobs of standing up for other issues and are simply ignorant on this one, and probably always will be.  Hopefully they will staff up, listen to the EFF and ACLU, and I can tell you from having been involved in activism from the jail cell to the armchair that when you call your representative you are helping to DEMAND that they meet with the experts who are on our side.  When we choose a day to call them, that means that everyone in congress will be talking about this issue today, whether they like it or not, even if every time their chief of staff speaks to them they mention, &quot;and lots more people called about the internet.&quot;<p>This tells them that a bunch of people are upset, and even if they can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t each individually give us exactly what we want - votes for and against, depending on the situation, it registers that to preserve their career they need to engage this concern somehow.<p>Generationally, we will win this.  We will undo whatever damage the current generation of power brokers do, but undoing fucked up legislation is REALLY FUCKING HARD, so if we can even round some of the corners for the discussion we&#x27;ll be having in ten years, if we can even slow each lost battle by a year, by a term, by a decade, the tide will turn, some of today&#x27;s ignorant voters and legislators will die, and we will inherit a world that has far more flaws than flawed internet regulations, like dying oceans.<p>Also I wouldn&#x27;t be too hard on the OP, activism is hard, and it&#x27;s fucking frustrating, and it sounds like he or she engages with a lot of activists and doesn&#x27;t hear the greater conversation they&#x27;re trying to influence, but hears the DEAFENING BLAH FUCKING BLAH which I totally sympathize with, but that DEAFENING BLAH FUCKING BLAH is a whimper to some people and sometimes we just need to mostly agree on a message and execute it and come back tomorrow to do it some more.<p>If the alternative is shutting up and watching the wrong shit happen and complaining next week that noone wants to help with my awesome activism plan, I&#x27;ll be calling my representative today.",1392141821

All it takes is 16 digits to fraudulently use somebody else&#x27;s money and the merchant is typically liable in case of that. And to add insult to the injury, they add a $20 chargeback fee on top.
