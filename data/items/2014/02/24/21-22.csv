I agree completely that the easy snapshot ability is very cool and it wasn&#x27;t my intention to minimize it.<p>The main reason I dug into this so deep is because after reading your article I had a nagging feeling that using anything other than React or immutable data structures was an architectural dead end.  But I&#x27;m not so worried about that now; I think that any framework that aggressively batches DOM updates will probably be ok performance-wise, and I think that mutable data structures can perform well.<p>Also I think that some features are easier to provide with mutable structures, such as automatic two-way data binding a la Angular.  How do you propagate DOM changes to your models?  Manual event handlers or do you have something more automatic?<p>I definitely think that immutable data structures are worth consideration for their snapshotting ability though.",1393278834

This can have an immediate impact. It also means being in politics. I&#x27;m awful at politics, so I didn&#x27;t opt for that path.<p>2. IMPROVE THE EDUCATION OF UPCOMING GENERATIONS. This is a slower, yet more fundamental way to shift a society. If you can&#x27;t cure cancer, maybe you can help set up an environment to educate someone else who can. This is the path I choose.<p>I&#x27;m not a teacher. I opted for the education technology (also known as &quot;edtech&quot;) industry. Technology isn&#x27;t a panacea for all the problems you may see in the education system, but since it&#x27;s a system fraught with inefficiencies, there are many opportunities for technical improvements. The trick is, of course, finding the right opportunity that can also develop into a self-sustaining process/organization.<p>That was my own assessment, at least. With your experience in the US State Dept, politics may also be a viable path for you. Either way, we definitely need more people like you! Cheers for asking this question.",1393278494

7293621,comment,7290676,7291794,6,0,bad_user,,,"In both languages threads are an added after-thought and no, I disagree with you - multithreading is not an implementation detail. For example, why do you think classes in Java are immutable?<p>Also, I consider the standard library to be a part of the core language, because it is. Python doesn&#x27;t have many concurrency primitives that are commonly used in Java, even really common ones, like AtomicReference or CountDownLatch. Heck, it doesn&#x27;t even have volatile variables, let alone ForkJoinPool or other niceties. What&#x27;s actually in the standard library? Well, the multiprocessing library is now baked in for doing &quot;process-based threading&quot;, which really means stuff based on fork() that is unportable, because the language implementors gave up on threads a long time ago.<p>It doesn&#x27;t stop at concurrency primitives though. For example Python has the notion of destructors in the language, the reference implementation having a GC based on reference counting, so when implementing it on top of the JVM/CLR or whatever platform that doesn&#x27;t do reference counting, that&#x27;s at least one feature that can&#x27;t work.<p>Add to that libraries like NumPy/Scipy that are basically unportable, or Django that says it runs on Jython but nobody mentions that Django needs the MySQL client written in C and won&#x27;t work with the pure version, or the myriad other libraries in the ecosystem all written for CPython and expecting a GIL. Anybody that is fantasizing about Python having a usable implementation other than CPython is delusional.",1393278490

Will the French Alps suddenly and catastrophically acquire a new valley?&quot;<p>As others have said, this is hot fusion not cold fusion, so the answer is most likely it would damage some very expensive components. The holy grail of fusion research (which so far seems largely unachievable) would be fusion at something relatively close to room temperature (so called cold fusion), as opposed to this experiment where you&#x27;re dealing with temperatures comparable to the heart of the sun. The reason that&#x27;s such a big deal is that before actual fusion occurs on a hot fusion reactor, you obviously must first reach the target temperature which takes a not inconsiderable amount of energy to achieve, and then further energy to maintain. The trick to making hot fusion practical is to somehow get more energy out, than you have to put in to maintain those insanely high temperatures. Obviously if you can find a way to still achieve fusion at a much lower temperature the situation becomes much easier as you&#x27;ve got a bigger gradient to play with (I.E. it produces the same amount of power, but requires much less power to get it to the state necessary to produce that power).<p>In order to achieve the massive temperatures necessary they do a couple things. First, you&#x27;re talking about an incredibly tiny volume of space that&#x27;s being heated to these temperatures (think of this as the difference between boiling the ocean vs. boiling a cup of water). Secondly they reduce the pressure to near vacuum. Thirdly they maintain these conditions inside of a magnetic bottle which is necessary primarily to provide insulation, both for the fusion material (the hydrogen) and for the apparatus that are heating and containing the fusion material (super conductors like it very cold and must be very close to the fusion material, so you&#x27;re talking a pretty steep temperature gradient here).<p>Now, assuming they actually get this thing working, it&#x27;s going to consist of a very very tiny super hot ball of very very thin hydrogen gas, surrounded by a near vacuum, and then a shell of super cold super conducting magnets. If containment were to suddenly fail, that small ball of gas would very rapidly expand outward until it collided with the walls of the containment vessel which would most likely consist of super conducting magnets, and whatever insulating material they can find to slap between them and the hydrogen. But remember, this is a very tiny quantity of hydrogen and it&#x27;s surrounded by what is effectively a vacuum, as it expands outwards it will rapidly cool and become even more tenuous. Some of the atoms my still be energetic enough upon impacting the containment vessel to pit it or otherwise damage it, but absolute worse case scenario they do some damage to the super conductors and the vessel walls. There&#x27;s basically no scenario in which containment failure leads to anything that the average person would describe as an explosion.<p>Now, what I would personally be worried about, and would be far more destructive is not a loss of containment, but some sort of catastrophic failure of the super conducting elements. Still probably not something anyone would worry about outside the facility, but it has a lot more potential to do damage that might conceivably hurt someone in the plant than something like loss of containment would.",1393276412

Having very little FP experience and zero Clojure experience, however, sometimes you&#x27;re going a little fast for me, so was hoping whether you or someone else who reads this could help me out.<p>I don&#x27;t completely understand how entirely immutable data can be effectively used in front end apps (I do understand how, <i>if</i> you have immutable data, React can be made fast and undo is easy). If data changes, it needs to mutate, right? Do you then maintain one global object that does change, and have that object be a giant immutable tree with all model data? Or am I completely missing the approach?<p>If that&#x27;s the way, how can you efficiently do updates on relatively large chunks of data? Say, I&#x27;m coding Gmail and my user wants to star the 2053rd email in a list? Doesn&#x27;t that mean 2052 items in a list have to be copied? In general, doesn&#x27;t this make model code much much more complicated? Or am I missing something and is it really not that bad?<p>Yeah, a bit many question marks, but I hope you catch my drift :)<p>If anyone could point me to some good reading about thinking in immutable data terms, that would be warmly appreciated too.

I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s vague, let me recap:<p>1. &#x27;might&#x27; implies the future. As you can tell from the post you&#x27;re replying to, Systemtap is present thing. I think I actually put most of the tapsets shown on the Wikipedia page around 2009, and I was using them then.<p>2. Also, as the author partially acknowledges in the next slide, Ubuntu is the dumbest place to illustrate a typical Systemtap experience. I suspect that&#x27;s deliberate, rather than ignorance as Sun tried that a few years back and I don&#x27;t think anyone with any interest in the matter is ignorant enough not to remember the shitstorm.<p>As I&#x27;ve written elsewhere: if your customers mostly run Ubuntu, then test dtrace on Ubuntu too.
