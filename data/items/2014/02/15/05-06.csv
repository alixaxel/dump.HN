From those options it strikes me as if the form would really care about wether or not I am male or female, but if I am a doctor, then who cares if I am female or male, I  have apparently made it to a higher state of being, one that transcends gender. Get rid of salutations all together. If it is important for you to know the persons gender, ask them specifically that question. If, for some unknown reason, you also need to know if the person completing the form is a medical doctor, or a doctor of another type, ask that question directly as well.",1392443996

The Guardian, which restricts its use of honorific titles to leading articles, states in its style guide: &quot;use Ms for women... unless they have expressed a preference for Miss or Mrs&quot;.<p>In business, &quot;Ms.&quot; is considered to be the standard default title for women until or unless an individual makes another preference known.

It&#x27;s because it&#x27;s almost always easier to improve a simple solution by adding complexity, than it is to improve a complicated solution by digging out a simple solution buried within it.<p>While the second part of that is an interesting observation, the first part is simply false. It basically comes down to prior probabilities and conjunctions. Every bit of new information implied by a hypothesis is another &quot;and&quot;.

Certainly the story of Jesus is <i>evidence</i>, but it&#x27;s not clear which direction the evidence should push us. Someone making a claim does not always mean our posterior estimate on the claim should increase.<p>Here&#x27;s a simple example:<p>I hand you a small bottle filled with medical-looking pills and a nice label.  I ask you, &quot;What&#x27;s the chance these pills cure malignant melanoma cancer?&quot; You think for a moment, then answer, &quot;Very small. There may be a cure eventually, but I&#x27;ve never seen evidence. I&#x27;m not on the cutting edge of research though, so perhaps this is a new breakthrough I haven&#x27;t heard of. Plausible, but unlikely.&quot;<p>I then say, &quot;Well, let me reassure you by showing you the website I ordered the pills from.&quot;<p>I bring up the website, which shows testimonial after testimonial of people claiming the pills cure malignant melanoma cancer. You then respond (correctly), &quot;I&#x27;ve decreased my estimate. There is still a chance, of course, that the pills work, but I now know these pills are not from a legitimate medical breakthrough I hadn&#x27;t heard of yet. In fact, this website pattern matches as a scam, so I&#x27;m decreasing my posterior to an estimate even lower than my completely uninformed prior.&quot;<p>P(Pills work | testimonials) < P(Pills are a scam | testimonials)<p>Of course, the testimonials would be positive evidence if the pills had passed clinical trials.<p>Now, which is bigger:<p>P(Jesus is the son of God | Jesus said he is the son of God)<p>or<p>P(Jesus is was just a guy | Jesus said he is the son of God) ?<p>Honestly, this is not clear to me at all. But I think once we start taking in all the other evidence related to (but not necessarily <i>in favor of</i>) Christianity things become more clear. Just like the pill&#x27;s website pattern matched for a scammy website, it seems to me that the evidence related to Christianity pattern matches to the evidence related to other man made religions. So I conclude:<p>P(Christianity is man-made | evidence) > P(Christianity is correct | evidence)<p>Hence P(Christianity is correct | evidence) may very well be <i>less</i> than the uniform prior that a particular god exists.<p>Edit: The above symbols aren&#x27;t right, as yummy points out below, but the argument and analogy is sound. What we care about is the change in probability of each possibility. If<p>P(Christianity is man-made | evidence) > P(Christianity is man-made)<p>then we can conclude that Christianity is less likely due to the evidence.",1392442011

I mean bad beyond just the economic implications. Since the climate system has been working a certain way for ~10000 years, I&#x27;d say the default position should be that nothing is going to change.<p>What&#x27;s missing from your reply is an answer to the data he&#x27;s showing. A long time criticism of the IPCC is that, well, they&#x27;re wrong. In the sense that if you compare their numbers with reality, their predictions turn out to be a pile of crap. In a truly absolute sense of the word. The IPCC&#x27;s 95% certainty bands it gave for 5 years out have been violated EVERY single time (5 times) they made a prediction (for the 6th prediction, the jury is still out until the end of next year. However, it&#x27;s not looking good).<p>If they really were 95% sure, that means they had a once in 16 MILLION years streak of bad luck (1/0.05^5 * 5 years) (and unless that 6th prediction works out, and global temperature rises by at least 1.2 degrees in about a year and a half, that will be a once in 320 million years streak of bad luck). That is significantly less believable, in my humble opinion, than the theory that they&#x27;re just pulling numbers out of their ass (not necessarily intentionally), no matter how unflattering that claim may be to the many smart people working that field.<p>So in short : yes, I think doing nothing is the correct answer. You can&#x27;t hope to do a better job doing something versus not doing something in this case, so the best course of action (least cost/maximum benefit) can only be to not do anything. So yes, nothing.<p>Either that, or switch to climate engineering (ie. change the question : no longer about how to restore &quot;natural&quot; climate, whatever that is. The question becomes : how do we fully bend the climate to our will. That and related questions, like what do we actually want the climate to be (I doubt the answer will be as simple as people think)).<p>So I don&#x27;t agree with your flagging this, no. Yes, the article&#x27;s author is probably not the right person to believe this claim from. But he&#x27;s right (well, the first few paragraphs).
