His son Rand Paul seems to be taken more seriously, but libertarians seem to have extremely mixed opinions of him, since he is more of a pragmatist than his father (which they interpret as compromising on core values). Note: I am not a libertarian, but I have many friends who are deeply involved with the movement, so this is my rough view from afar.",1392321583

The definition of &quot;high skill&quot; and &quot;low skill&quot; are dependent variables on the environment, not independent variables like this research treats them.<p>I also find this bit: <i>&quot;Adapting to skills beyond your domain is really hard, especially when you are aging.&quot;</i> really interesting. It&#x27;s the difference between &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;possible.&quot; I get that its hard to go back into learning mode, especially to recapture that ability to treat every new thing as a gem to be admired. But I have not found any evidence that it isn&#x27;t possible. And being hard is not in and of itself a reason not to do something. Especially if doing this &#x27;hard&#x27; thing can greatly enhance your ability to be productive in the new environment.<p>In your fictional scenario, I would totally start working on blacksmithing. They seemed to be the &#x27;hackers&#x27; of their day. And I&#x27;d expect it to take several years before anyone would seriously considering using my services for anything other than basic stuff.

You also need to consider how one type of housing can substitute for another.  Building luxury condos (for example) doesn&#x27;t immediately help middle and lower-middle class renters.  However, the condo could appeal to highly-paid software engineers who would have otherwise rented an expensive but basic.  That reduces demand for basic apartments, which puts downward pressure on prices for those units.  It&#x27;s not the same effect as just building a bunch of basic apartments, but it still helps more than doing nothing.<p>> Also, more people may move from elsewhere to fill the vacancies provided by new units, driving higher prices for new units and making an area unaffordable for existing residents.<p>This doesn&#x27;t really make any sense at all.  You&#x27;re saying that rising rents encourage people to move to move to SF.  If anything, rising rents will tend to discourage people from moving to SF for a tech job.  Sure, the salary is high, but why bother if you&#x27;re going have less left over after paying rent?<p>Look, it&#x27;s not valid to say that people are perfectly rational, uniform, black spheres.  People make irrational decisions all the time.  But nobody says to him/herself, &quot;I&#x27;d like to move to New York next year because the cost of living is so high.&quot;  Building more housing units <i>will</i> result in more people living in SF, but it will also reduce the cost of living in SF compared to--and this part is important--what it would have otherwise been.",1392320627

Or what if you just kept 10 separate addresses and used 1 at a time manually ? You&#x27;ll tie up 1 address for up to an hour but the likelihood of making 10 transactions an hour is fairly low, and if you did want to do that, you could still split and proceed.<p>Entropy for BTC addresses is fairly high and each person on the planet can have far more than 10 so this is a non-issue in terms of availability.<p>Clients could manage these scenarios fairly easily if unconfirmed inputs/outputs were indeed to become a limiting factor.",1392320311

I meant more that you take on debt in every choice you make, and many of these &quot;debts&quot; will not come due for anyone.<p>Consider, many folks that are writing PHP level apps do not know how the full HTTP stack works.  Expand that, most people writing web apps of any flavor have a small understanding of this.<p>For most of us, this is not a big deal and never becomes due.  We took on some technical debt by trusting the frameworks that we have chosen to handle them for us.<p>However, if any of us find ourselves at the scale of Facebook, Twitter, etc, then we find that suddenly a lot of the tiny details of HTTP start to matter.  To the point that solutions that minimize resources and the like suddenly matter.  Heavily.<p>All too often, however, people use this argument in favor of &quot;shiney new framework.&quot;  Taking on struts was technical debt because you offloaded much of your core to them.  I question whether many companies truly needed to ditch fully working struts implementations in favor of &quot;new shiney,&quot; though.<p>And then, this metaphor can be extended in amusing ways.  There was the assertion that git took on unnecessary &quot;technical debt&quot; by remaining in C instead of C++.  Instead, it can also be seen more as they took on the cost of not having abstractions unto themselves.<p>So, my assertion is that for most projects, the benefit of a technical debt never outweighs the downside.  Not because the project will &quot;go away&quot; but because it just is never really a problem.<p>Your gambling example is amusing to me.  Few people will ever consider that healthy debt.

For example, I can just time how long it takes for me to run (prepopulate-monsters).<p>Well, you can do the same here, for each actor&#x27;s loop. With a single loop you&#x27;re letting your hardware go to waste and limit your scalability.<p>> So then, I have to aggregate the loop running-times for every entity, or take a census of entities overrunning?<p>You can do both.

How would this be architected differently using actors?<p>Well, you could always still use a single-threaded loop and offload computation to actors. But a better way would be to split each entity to two actors. One for sending feedback to the player, and one for slow computation. If you want to ensure little interference, you can run the different kinds of actors in different Quasar schedulers, each using a different thread-pool, and control the number of threads in each of the pools. Quasar also supports distributed actors, so you can place the slow, computation-heavy ones on different machines, just as you have planned.",1392319636

Most people don&#x27;t lock their doors, even if they shut them.<p>> I know bringing things from the real world into the digital realm often results in badly overstretched metaphors.<p>Except this metaphor is already stretched beyond breaking.  An index isn&#x27;t even a copy.<p>Copying a set of publicly available read-only files is not theft (you still have your copy I haven&#x27;t deprived you of it).<p>But we&#x27;re not even talking about copying your files, just the names you&#x27;ve assigned to them.

7233577,comment,7233001,7233210,7,0,maximgsaini,,,"I see English as more of a liability for a country like India. Only 10% of the Indian elites have any sort of proficiency in English. Indians never developed an &#x27;infrastructure&#x27; around their native language like China did, which results in a debilitating problem for India. There is a big language barrier in India. A poor Chinese kid doesn&#x27;t need to learn a foreign language to be hired as a full time programmer. But in India, unless you have a working proficiency in English, say goodbye to any chances of being hired as a programmer. Say goodbye to any real possibility of using a computer. Say goodbye to the possibility of understanding any real biochemistry. In India, I can&#x27;t take a guy from the streets, give him 2 days of training and ask him to do some work on a computer. I&#x27;ll have to spend 2 months with him, teaching him a new language.<p>Thus now there are two Indias, the 80-90% non-english speaking India, and the 10-20% english speaking elite India. And the language barrier makes it that much harder for the under-privileged India to cross over to the other side, which is not the case in China or Japan.<p>In 10 years, the kind of language used for human communication will become irrelevant. Thus, I hope that the Indian problem won&#x27;t last very long.",1392319341

Many four year college graduates today have more mathematics than a professor of mathematics had 100 years ago. Did the &#x27;math skill&#x27; go from &#x27;high skill&#x27; to &#x27;middle skill&#x27;?<p>Most of the things I&#x27;ve read is that people have the &#x27;wrong&#x27; skills, so if you have the &#x27;correct&#x27; skills you are in a minority, sought after and can demand higher wages, if you have the &#x27;wrong&#x27; skills you are competing with everyone else for anything available, which runs the gamut from &#x27;no skills&#x27; to &#x27;easily acquired quickly&#x27; skills.<p>An interesting question for me is how people change their skill sets over time. I am familiar with engineers who &#x27;stopped learning&#x27; and when the industry had moved past the technologies they were skilled in, they became unemployed and stayed that way until they developed new skills. And in that vein it would be interesting to know what is the rate of change in demanded skills vs their time to acquire. We take kids out of high school and turn them into software engineers with fours years of engineering curriculum (which could easily be done in 2 years if you skipped all the general Ed classes. 128 units of which 64 are in your major? Seems like a testable hypothesis.) There are jobs where you need a Ph.D (or MD, or JD) so that skill set is takes a bit more than 2 years to acquire (6 - 8 depending).<p>I don&#x27;t see skills as this thing you get between the ages of 18 and 22 and the forever and ever after you either use them or die.

Yet indeed, just like our programming languages use &quot;if&quot; &quot;case&quot; &quot;return&quot; et al (&quot;et al&quot; is a Latin abbreviation by the way), music uses Italian keywords.  Yet it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable to read source code in French with anglicisms like new String scattered perfectly comprehensively throughout.  It doesn&#x27;t inhibit the programmer at all.<p>Now to fully embrace <i>your</i> point: the number of Mandarin speakers (as a first or second language) is probably about 1.3x the total number of English speakers (as a first or second language).  The implicit question of the linked article is: &quot;perhaps there is, or soon will be, a larger pool of programming discussion for which YOU are excluded because <i>you</i>, merely out of political reasons, won&#x27;t learn Mandarin Chinese.<p>English is by far my favorite language to speak, but I know its limitations and don&#x27;t always use it even when I can.  I&#x27;ve noted that if I&#x27;m out with friends who all have multiple languages in common the conversation does not stay in only one of them.  In programming or not, I will often read wikipedia articles on the same topic but in different languages.  Quality is uneven and the most informative or insightful article is frequently not the one in English.",1392318399

I had DNS/NTP servers setup on a helper box and didn&#x27;t lock it down and forgot about it. It has has multiple 1Gbps uplinks and was sending a couple hundred Mbps of traffic out. If someone started sending a couple hundred Mbps of traffic back, first, I wouldn&#x27;t notice until I got a bill later on. Second, if for some reason I happened to look at that machine and saw a huge amount of incoming traffic from a single source, I&#x27;d probably just ask for it to be null-routed. I might incidentally notice that I was sending out a lot of packets, maybe.<p>To actually get the benefits you&#x27;re suggesting, CloudFlare would have to actually DDoS (spoof data from multiple IPs to the point of overwhelming the target) every participating NTP server. So on a 100Gbps attack, they&#x27;d need to send out, I dunno, 1Tbps of spoofed traffic? Not probably a wise idea.<p>The correct way is to just contact the network abuse team. That way I get an email telling me to fix my server. And it&#x27;s taken care of as quickly as possible.<p>And the real correct way is for all ISPs to implement source filtering, but last I checked, that was laughably far from being implemented.
