7286509,comment,7285522,7285522,1,0,kellros,,,"Pretty good article, I especially like the idea behind doing linear time comparison using XOR.<p>Although, the XOR comparison implementation seems flawed as it will only compare min(supplied password length, existing password length); which would allow the attacker to identify the existing password length by providing a sufficiently long password. Instead the existing password should be padded to the length of the supplied password in order to hide the length of the existing password.<p>My issue with the XOR comparison implementation is irrelevant as password hashing should use stretching (ex. PBKDF2, BCrypt, SCrypt) which means the hash of the supplied password and that of the existing password would be the same length.<p>The implementation of the PBKDF2 is also flawed.<p>Iterations: The recommended PBKDF2 iterations has long surpassed 10,000 (it&#x27;s closer to 100,00 now). See here: <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3959/recommended-of-iterations-when-using-pkbdf2-sha256"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/3959/recommended...</a><p>The rule of them is that given a sufficient length salt, the number of iterations should take about 8ms on the hardware it is running on.<p>Salt Size: The recommended salt size is 128-bits/16 bytes (not 24). See here: <a href=""http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17994/with-pbkdf2-what-is-an-optimal-hash-size-in-bytes-what-about-the-size-of-the-s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/17994/with-pbkdf...</a><p>That stackexchange question also recommends using SHA512 as it requires 64-bit arithmetic operations which GPU&#x27;s are supposidly not great at.<p>I believe I read stackoverflow and most big websites store about 24 bytes of the hash. The salt is generally prefixed to the hash and that is stored (ex. salt size 16 bytes + password hash 24 bytes = 40 bytes).<p>If I wanted to version a stored password, I&#x27;d simply use the first byte as an indexer to select a password hashing function instead of prefixing the hash with the number of iterations which seems non-portable.<p>Even if you do everything right concerning the hashing of passwords, account security extends beyond passwords - such as alternative methods of authenticating (forgot password, secret questions, authentication tokens). OWASP is a great authority in regards to this: <a href=""https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet</a>",1393174796
7286508,comment,7286080,7286251,7,0,mjn,,,"Even with a VPN, there&#x27;s quite a bit of data-mining that can be done just by looking at the total traffic, ignoring destinations. An interested ISP could probably still guess when you&#x27;re watching streaming video, when people in your household typically wake up, sleep, and leave for work, etc. You could make that harder by padding the link with dummy traffic, though, like some darknet software does. That&#x27;d probably work, especially if we assume the ISP is just doing aggregate data-mining on usage data, not targeting you specifically and willing to spend much time de-obfuscating your obfuscation scheme. But it might be expensive to be pumping dummy data 24/7 if your VPN or home connection has traffic limits or bills by the GB.<p>Something similar is a concern with power companies as well. Even though electric meters only record total usage (kW being used by the apartment, not tagged with what it&#x27;s being used for), the move to smart meters that record power usage frequently has led to some concern, because you can do all kinds of analysis just from the raw electric-usage data. Different devices/appliances tend to have noticeable signatures, so an interested power company can tell when the washing machine goes on, when the TV is in use, arrive at good guesses of your sleeping and cooking patterns, etc.",1393174781
