7284462,story,,,1,0,skycocker,"Ask HN: How does Knock to unlock work?",,"It&#x27;s been bothering me for a few weeks now: how does Knock to unlock app work on the OS X side?<p>I read about authorization plugins like this NameAndPassword example: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/samplecode/NameAndPassword/Introduction/Intro.html<p>After I managed to build and install it (which wasn&#x27;t so easy: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21582995/custom-login-lock-screen-in-os-x-mavericks) it won&#x27;t log me in (more discussion here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21056322/customize-login-screen-mac-osx-sfauthorizationpluginview#comment33224960_21056322). With this happening and the documentation with examples being outdated, I think it&#x27;s not the proper way to modify the lock screen today. Also, I guess it only works on the login/fast-user-switch screen, but not on the wake from sleep one. So basically my question is: how <i>exactly</i> does Knock modify the lock screen, and how is it possible to recreate this behavior with some other plugin? (I&#x27;m currently working on something like fingerprint scanner)<p>One user on SO wrote about some login agents: http://stackoverflow.com/a/21835312/2113110 - I&#x27;ve tried pre login agents, but I guess it&#x27;s not the same thing.",1393117181

7284456,comment,7253711,7257637,1,0,sequence7,,,"> Err, no - MSBuild, is basically a clone of Ant, except that it is meant to be generated by Visual Studio. This is completely backwards from what happens in say Java/Scala with Maven, SBT or Gradle.<p>MSBuild does not require Visual Studio<p>> The advantage of having the build process external, as happens with Maven and Maven-like environments, is that you can easily automate things by writing plugins, plus you&#x27;re not tied to the IDE at all. You need to push your artifacts into a repository? There&#x27;s a plugin for that. You need to sign your artifacts with a PGP key? There&#x27;s a plugin for that. You need to automatically increment the version number on releases? There&#x27;s a plugin for that. Etc, etc... and all of these can be used in continuos integration processes.<p>The equivalent of plugins for MSBuild is Tasks<p>> Plus, MSBuild doesn&#x27;t handle dependency management, which is completely retarded. You&#x27;ve got NuGet now, but again, Microsoft had to over-engineer it, to make it IDE friendly and thus the ease of setting up your own Maven repository is gone.<p>Yes it does via NuGet, and again NuGet has no dependency on the IDE<p>> And have you tried building MSBuild projects on top of Mono? Try it. It&#x27;s fun ;-)<p>Yes I have, what&#x27;s your point?<p>> Basically only a .NET developer that never experienced other environments could claim that MSBuild/VS.NET is satisfactory, but for the rest of us, it&#x27;s like trying to do software development with early-2000 tools and IMHO, that&#x27;s where the entire .NET ecosystem is.<p>Thanks for the personal and professional attack at the end there, nice touch",1393117038

Because what’s critical to be an effective leader in this environment is you have to be willing to relinquish power.<p>Which I think is what the author is trying to focus on. Traditional leadership would be making the decisions and taking risks because it&#x27;s expected and people are asking you &quot;Hey, what do we do?&quot;. Emergent leadership would then be making decisions and taking risks because it needs to happen or equally importantly acknowledging that someone else is more capable of doing so. I would <i>bet</i> that in the interview process they&#x27;d focus on the story and trying to determine how you make the decision to either ignore the chain of command or otherwise exert influence on it.<p>Like you said, that definitely selects more for storytelling skills than leadership skills, but in absence of other more accurate metrics I think that&#x27;s still better than looking for &quot;President of Chess Club&quot; on a resume.<p>Unrelated, I&#x27;d love to read those narratives.

This required ongoing expense on the server side combined with a client side app.<p>2) XMPP is connection oriented and doesn&#x27;t handle the disruption of disconnections and changing IPs/networks when a mobile device roams or transitions from wifi to cellular data.<p>On the political side, I think GTalk had, by far, the largest network of XMPP users.

Any geek can look at a description of the bug, or even the code itself, and say to themselves, &quot;hey, I could exploit that!&quot;. Because more people understand this bug than they would any other bug, it paradoxically seems scarier.<p>The reality however is that the ease with which a bug can be exploited has little to do with its impact. What matters is the feasibility of exploitation. And in terms of feasibility, this bug is <i>less</i> exploitable than the kinds of bugs that are disclosed in every platform every month; it requires a specific (common, but not universal) set of circumstances to escalate it to code execution.<p>Matthew Green told a Reuters reporter yesterday that the TLS bug was &quot;as bad as could be imagined&quot;. He was also drinking†, which explains how he managed to find a TLS validation bug worse than memory corruption, which is discovered routinely in all platforms, and produces attacks that directly, instantly hijack machines regardless of their configuration and the network they operate on.<p>Vulnerabilities in TLS code are not all that unusual. We get a new one every couple years or so. There was a vulnerability in the NSS False-Start code a year ago --- it didn&#x27;t get covered because (a) few people know what NSS is (it&#x27;s the TLS library for Firefox and Chrome) and (b) nobody knows or cares about False-Start. Here&#x27;s another example: NSS misparsed PKCS1v15 padding, such that an e=3 RSA certificate could be forged --- anyone on the Internet could run a small Python script to generate a certificate for any site. Certificate chaining has broken within the last ~4 years ago. Again, no coverage: what&#x27;s e=3 RSA? How does chaining work?<p>Simple thought experiment: imagine if, instead of a missing-brace bug that broke all of TLS, it was instead disclosed that NSS had a memory corruption vulnerability in its PKCS1v15 parsing. Would there be a shitstorm in the media and on Twitter? I doubt it: comparable bugs are found routinely without shitstorms.<p>I don&#x27;t know if NSA knew about this bug or didn&#x27;t. If they did, I&#x27;m confident that they exploited it; that&#x27;s what they do. But ask yourself if you&#x27;re sure that NSS and SecureTransport and OpenSSL and SCHANNEL are free from the kinds of memory corruption vulnerabilities that would allow NSA (and other organized criminals) to hijack machines directly. You think <i>this</i> is the bug they&#x27;re relying on?<p>† <i>No, really.</i>",1393114328

I wonder if they&#x27;ll do it again for ffvp9<p>As long as there aren&#x27;t any compability issues I can&#x27;t see why not, that said when playing some of my vp9 test encodings in VLC (which I believe uses ffvp9) I sometimes get decoding errors causing huge macro-blocks etc, when playing through Chrome or if I decode the vp9 stream to another format they play perfectly.<p>Oh, and I unfortunately missed and downvoted you instead of upvoting you (curse those small arrows!), I apologize and blame the crappy cold I&#x27;m currently down with which is making me drowsy.",1393113712
