7395750,comment,7394828,7394828,13,0,md224,,,"Interesting experiment. Here&#x27;s a thought: what if users could break down arguments into smaller &quot;atomic&quot; propositions (yes, this is somewhat inspired by the now defunct philosophy of Logical Atomism).<p>For example, taken from an actual debate on Saysaw about policing cyber-bullying:<p>&quot;In theory, yes - but in practice, no. How on earth would we judge what an acceptable thing to say or post actually is? Do we have a mean-tweet checklist? Besides, if people aren&#x27;t being mean in one place, they&#x27;ll do it in another - that&#x27;s the internet for you. People should just learn that their words, in whichever forum or situation they are said, have the power to upset or offend people.&quot;<p>This person&#x27;s argument seems to consist of a few assertions, themselves debatable (in the literal sense of &quot;can be debated on Saysaw&quot;). These include:<p>1) We cannot have a reliable method for determining the &quot;acceptability&quot; of content<p>2) Censoring a bully in one channel of communication will lead them to continue bullying in another<p>These assumptions could be spun out into their own Saysaw debates, and these debates could be linked to other arguments on the site that use them as a premise. This would provide a rough way to estimate the plausibility of an argument: how much are its premises supported?<p>This may also have the effect of helping people to drill down to the core of a disagreement. A lot of debates are unproductive because people don&#x27;t seem to understand what they&#x27;re actually disagreeing about. Providing an avenue for breaking an argument down into its components may make it easier to locate the actual point(s) of contention.<p>Anyway, this is just brainstorming... not necessarily a workable system but something to think about.",1394751548

Finding primary sources and extracting relevant information from them is such a difficult process that disturbingly few people do it, even though it really ought to be central to a good debate. Reducing friction in the resource-finding process, curating already-discovered relevant resources (one sentence summaries + search), figuring out a way to reward evidence-based arguments, and punishing fabrications would all be huge value-adds. The real trick, of course, is figuring out how to keep people at the lower end of the spectrum engaged.<p>I recently had the pleasant surprise of stumbling across procon.org, which appears to address some of those value-add categories (it looks curated, so there&#x27;s still space for somebody to automate the process, thereby extending it to small or recent issues).

Although this can even happen when their English is worse than your German. Especially Germans are really proud to be &quot;international&quot; even though it&#x27;s not always justified.<p>Or they don&#x27;t want you to stagger about in a language you don&#x27;t know very well. So some want to be polite and spare you the trouble to speak it. Of course that doesn&#x27;t help you but you should then insist and say something about &quot;learning this beautiful language&quot; and then usually they can&#x27;t deny you this.<p>In IT it&#x27;s quite custom that anybody speaks English when somebody is around that doesn&#x27;t speak German as you are expected to know the language well enough. After all in IT, you need English every day. For Zurich, which has a great number of foreigners, this applies as well.<p>For Switzerland in general, remember that the Swiss dialect is quite different from Standard German and there are many Swiss who are not that comfortable speaking Standard German so switching to English is an option when they actually don&#x27;t want you to notice how bad their German is.",1394750773

GCS and S3 are, at least for the first TB, exactly the same price at $0.085/GB.<p>> This means that any service built on top of Amazon S3 will never be less expensive than Google Drive. Period.<p>That depends. With drive you pay for allocated capacity, with S3 don&#x27;t you pay for actual usage? Depending on the level of overcommit, its possible for less expensive per GB &quot;capacity&quot; priced service to be profitable on top of a more expensive per GB &quot;usage&quot; priced service.<p>Plus, its at least theoretically possible, especially if a lot of the stored content is <i>not</i> efficiently compressed on its own, that the consumer capacity-priced service could also use compression and/or deduplication to further reduce usage on the usage-priced backend.<p>> Google Drive is not programmatically accessible like S3.<p>Google Drive most assuredly is programmatically accessible via an API.",1394750743

I have never had any trouble at all finishing all the sections of a standardized test with time to spare, for example, whether the SAT or the GRE or the LSAT. There is a huge published literature on reading skills improvement, for readers of all levels of reading proficiency, and when I was in university I read many books about that topic, including some books that made incredible &quot;speed-reading&quot; claims, to see what I could do to improve my ability to finish my homework while working my way through my university courses. One distillation I have of all the advice I read is that it helps reading speed and comprehension a lot to improve vocabulary. English vocabulary improvement can build on studying common Greek, Latin, and French word roots that show up over and over in English words. Doing that seems to have done the most for my reading speed and comprehension, which was never bad in English. A book I recommend for vocabulary development is <i>English Vocabulary Elements</i> 2nd edition.[1] To bolster my reading speed in other languages, I&#x27;ve also had to focus on reading practice and acquiring reading vocabulary. In Chinese for foreign learners, the materials by the late John DeFrancis, his <i>Chinese Reader</i> series in beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels, are still the best available for that purpose, although they appear to be going out of print.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/English-Vocabulary-Elements-Keith-Denning/dp/0195168038"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/English-Vocabulary-Elements-Keith-Denn...</a>",1394749963

It rotates on a weekly basis, and that team does the bug fixes / investigations / support queries that come in.<p>The advantage is that disruption to a sprint is amortised to a constant instead of being a variable. The weekly rotations ensure that people who are writing bugs aren&#x27;t isolated from the fixing of them - it also maintains morale, being stuck on a bug-fixing team is a bit of a gulag for devs IMO.",1394748200

You&#x27;re judging it based on the title (which is on par with judging a book by it&#x27;s cover).<p>As with most advice, you should take it with a pinch of salt but it is worth examining it and taking things that seem relevant to you.  If you never read anything then you&#x27;ll certainly close off the opportunity to find something useful.<p>In this case, the claim about &#x27;hours per day&#x27; is something I&#x27;ll dismiss. However, the idea of &#x27;No templates&#x27; for emails is quite useful as is the idea of keeping Playbooks (purely because it&#x27;s another word for &#x27;documentation&#x27; but people don&#x27;t get excited about that one).",1394748063

I personally like the single page app approach though for reasons other than the fact that it just creates the separation.",1394748044
