7495372,comment,7494709,7495100,3,0,olalonde,,,"> I was always dispirited by how conservative in sentiment Bitcoin and most altcoins were. It always felt to me that Bitcoin was mostly redundant to gold, neglecting the inherent advantages of ecurrency. Something more ambitious deserves to be implemented.<p>There is a good reason Bitcoin is conservative: it has to be, by design. It&#x27;s also what makes it attractive.<p>Also, you are completely wrong if you think that lack of ambition is the reason we don&#x27;t have a cryptocurrency that doesn&#x27;t neglect &quot;the inherent advantages of ecurrency&quot; by now. Lots of smart people, including esteemed computer scientists, have been thinking really hard about the subject for years and I find your comment a bit insulting towards them (I&#x27;ll pass it off as ignorance on your part). I too really hope we can eventually come up with a better cryptocurrency but please don&#x27;t assume people are not trying.",1396159138

7495368,comment,7492065,7495280,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"I mentioned canceled pre-orders and I don&#x27;t think that was unanticipated. I don&#x27;t know how many were canceled, but with Facebook&#x27;s coffers backing Oculus VR now, I must say I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re overly concerned. My understanding was that the DKs were being sold primarily to finance further development and prototyping (and in particular to provide proof to suppliers that sufficient volume would exist), which is now a non-issue since they now have essentially as much money as they want, and can order x million units to get bulk pricing regardless of consumer demand.<p>The only major project that&#x27;s been canceled was Minecraft, which Luckey privately pointed out was complete and utter vaporware anyway. I have a DK1 and I can tell you that most &quot;Rift projects&quot; were one-off tech demos that mostly weren&#x27;t maintained, and no one will miss. If OVR continues to develop a good product, people will continue to develop for their platform, whether Facebook owns them or not.<p>What PR damage, outside of the group that they expected would be unhappy? It&#x27;s all over the head of people who didn&#x27;t know what Oculus was before the acquisition. I don&#x27;t think people who aren&#x27;t part of the industry really care, because they don&#x27;t know anything about it. To the extent that it was covered by mainstream outlets, it was because Facebook bought another company, not because they were outraged that the dream of Oculus VR was being destroyed by FB.<p>Fear hasn&#x27;t replaced confidence in all consumers and developers. Logical persons may have their opinions and predictions, but no one is justified in anything beyond &quot;wait and see&quot; until something actually happens.<p>I&#x27;m not downplaying the impact of the ire of the gaming community. I just don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s been a noteworthy one other than the vast amount of fruitless rage that&#x27;s filled tech forums recently. Perhaps we disagree, but I don&#x27;t think my assertions are &quot;plain stupidity&quot;.",1396158972

7495366,comment,7494705,7494705,2,0,jmzbond,,,"This article may not be the best... but honestly the social construct that start-upers (especially in the early stage) are maniacally dedicated to work has become so tight that I worry it&#x27;s solidifying into an expectation.<p>When I started working on my idea, I felt guilty when not working. (I naturally don&#x27;t feel happy unless I&#x27;m productive, but this is probably also externally influenced.) In January, I worked 100+ hours. I cooked, ate, slept, went to the gym, but other than that I largely worked. Since I don&#x27;t consume media entertainment by nature and am an introvert, it was easy to work on my passion unless a friend proactively reached out. I slept-worked a lot, but never felt mentally tired or burned out. Physically though, I became a wreck, at some point tweaking something to the point where I couldn&#x27;t turn my head. Scary.<p>I used to think 4 hour work weeks were reserved for those who sought escape from a job they didn&#x27;t like. But I now realize that the larger goal of work/life balance is equally important for people who love their jobs. And I get that time feels threatening: we have to move fast or the opportunity will pass. But if this idea is something that I&#x27;m truly passionate about, I should have no problem devoting a lifetime to it (not blindly treading water without success, of course!).<p>Now, I know my happiness is still driven by productivity, but I&#x27;m trying to redefine that for myself. A day with friends, cleaning the apartment, or climbing at the gym is actually very productive and a good recharge. I really hope more entrepreneurs read this article, and really evaluate what working and living means for them.<p>FYI I wrote a blarticle about my experience in January and work/life balance here: <a href=""https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-corner/9461ce206589"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/entrepreneurs-corner/9461ce206589</a>",1396158870

I have no objection to this in principle, although it has an impact on the networks they can develop on any one account. If I have 20 Strangecoin accounts all coupled to and supporting each other, but are only receiving income through one account connected to the external network, then my subnet isn&#x27;t going to grow larger as a whole than the one node connected externally. So I can&#x27;t use multiple accounts to inflate just my identity. If I&#x27;m using multiple accounts, it&#x27;s because I want to maintain multiple identities.

The recruit is publicly lashed and discharged.<p>Later in private, the commander reprimands the drill instructor: there were standing orders to never <i>let</i> a recruit hit you.  They obviously <i>have</i> <i>to</i> punish recruits who strike instructors, but they do not <i>want</i> <i>to</i>.  The drill instructors are supposed to be elite soldiers, and this one let a recruit get the drop on him, and that mistake cost the infantry a recruit.<p>MIT had sufficient opportunity to stop Swartz with technical countermeasures -- but they failed to do so.  They allowed the situation to escalate until official punishment became unavoidable.  MIT may claim that they did not <i>want</i> to punish Swartz; few people will argue that they did.  It was not their intent but rather their incompetence that lead to his punishment.",1396156494

Technical execution of version 1 is perfectly successful. Core gamers generally buy the product, but the larger market is uninterested because of usage limitations (headset size and portability and/or lack of compelling enough uses outside of gaming). However, the number of sales is not large enough to justify continued investment. Facebook needs to find a large buyer to divest themselves of the technology profitably.<p>If they do not, the patent cache they hold chills any potential competition for fear of developing a market being ripped out from under them.",1396156416

The 6502 in a Commodore C64, and an MC68K in an Amiga.<p>Long time ago... The ZK81 had 1KB or RAM, seems impossible to do anything with that little RAM today. Yet, we wrote games with it.<p>I always feel a bit nostalgic when I read these kinds of articles.<p>What amazes me most is how easily one adapts to new technologies. These days I take my 4 core laptop with dedicted GPU running Linux for granted and don&#x27;t think about it twice.<p>But that&#x27;s also the fun part. I&#x27;m doing software for two decades professionally now, and there is always something new to learn, something new to pickup and explore! It&#x27;s exiting, I hope to get to do this for another decade or two.<p>It was also fun to be part of those &quot;pioneering&quot; year (albeit just as a user of the technology).",1396156344

7495303,comment,7489870,7493364,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"Be Quackable (or Googleable if you haven&#x27;t kept up with the times).<p>I&#x27;d actually prefer to avoid either the utterly boring generic name (in the sense of something that&#x27;s not readily searchable or differentiable), or something overly descriptive:  &quot;Facebook&quot; may well prove to be a liability in another ten years (assuming the company survives), if the present &quot;social network&quot; mania has faded or moved on, and the company with it.<p>Other than that:  beware of short acronyms which might be adopted by others.  &quot;SAS&quot; is an airline, a shoe company, a special operations force, a hard drive specification (now obsolete), an environmental activist group, a homonym for an online application provisioning technology ... and the name of the largest privately held software company in the US.<p>The worst possible case I can think of is &quot;R&quot;, a statistics software package, by way of command abbreviations, UNIX traditions, and free-software in-jokes.  &quot;S&quot; was the stats package for AT&T&#x27;s UNIX, a quickly typeable command a&#x27;la &#x27;ls&#x27;, &#x27;rm&#x27;, &#x27;cc&#x27;, &#x27;vi&#x27;, etc.   &quot;R&quot; was &quot;iterated S&quot; as a free software project.  It actually survives pretty well as a search term, though only for its popularity -- trying to break out now would likely be difficult.<p>Microsoft isn&#x27;t a bad name (though overly descriptive), but many of its product names (&quot;Word&quot;, &quot;Windows&quot;, &quot;Server&quot;, &quot;SQL Server&quot;, &quot;Outlook&quot;, &quot;Exchange&quot;) are hard to differentiate.  Even its most significant product offering, NT, was at the time predominantly associated with a Canadian telecoms concern, since bankrupted.<p>Though brief, IBM is spectacularly resilient, as is its description, &quot;International Business Machines&quot;.  SUN, the Stanford University Network, did pretty well.  &quot;Apple&quot;, despite being relatively generic, is distinctive in its space.  I&#x27;m partial to companies named for people, if only indirectly:  RSA was an exception in the IT space, though New Relic is an anagram of its founder and CEO&#x27;s name, Lew Cerne.  If nothing else it suggests a possible long-term investment by the founder, though there&#x27;s some risk:  Debian outlived Deborah and Ian&#x27;s marriage.<p>&quot;Google&quot; as a made-up word has survived pretty well, and can even transition (assuming trust in the company does) outside search.  &quot;Cisco&quot; for routers strikes me as good.  &quot;Salesforce.com&quot; seems to me to be ripe for a renaming eventually, as &quot;dot com&quot; anything still carries (for me at least) a taint of the get-rich-quick schemes of the late 1990s.  I see either &quot;Salesforce&quot; or &quot;SFC&quot; in its future.  &quot;Peoplesoft&quot; was similarly limited.  &quot;Oracle&quot; took its name from a government project.  Most of these are robust names, though each effectively created its brand image by filling an empty vessel.  On the other hand, &quot;Computer Associates&quot; is so generic (and tainted as &quot;where software goes to die) as to be pejorative.<p>Outside heavy manufacturing or specific service industries requiring specialization (e.g., transport, airlines, hospitality), I&#x27;d tend to avoid a very strong product tie.  &quot;General Motors&quot; has worked fairly well, &quot;Xerox&quot; isn&#x27;t too bad.  Software and services tend to be more ... fluid.<p>&quot;Lenovo&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean anything to me other than &quot;sells IBM kit I like&quot;, but I can find their website (if not anything <i>on</i> it once I&#x27;m there).  &quot;Apache&quot; was an in-joke to slapdash development efforts, &quot;vim&quot; a one-letter extension to a two-letter command.  &quot;Chrome&quot; seems to me to be getting overloaded with meanings (is it a browser, an OS, an &quot;environment&quot;, whatever that is)?  I suspect Android may be shed at some point as overly techy, though I could be wrong on that.  &quot;AWK&quot; is another founder&#x27;s name.  &quot;C&quot; is another don&#x27;t-do-that-but-it-worked single-letter name, and also something of a line of jokes:  BCPL -> B -> C -> C++, C#, C--, D.<p>There&#x27;s also the case of names which are meant to be <i>hard</i> to remember or recall:  &quot;Xe Services&quot; (formerly Blackwater, now Academi), Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris Companies).  Collections agencies often operate under <i>extremely</i> generic names which defy both recollection and search (&quot;Prestige Services&quot;).  Another favorite for reasons of obscurity is &quot;Various, Inc.&quot;, once described as a photo-oriented relationship networking organization.  Bail bondsmen like to be the first name in the book -- easy to find in a time of pressing need.  Pick your name to suit your goals for noteriety or not.uuuuuuuu<p>If you go back through history there are trends in company names:  place and description (New York Times, Pennsylvania Oil, Bethlehem Steel), founder(s) (Woolworths, Westinghouse, Pullman, Johnson Wax), size or generality (IBM, GE, NCR, NBC), mythology or culture (Mazda -- both lights and motorcars, Ajax, CBS).  In the 1920s, airlines were popular, though these referred to rail companies, as were radio companies (the dot-coms of the day).  In the 1960s, everything was &quot;-onic&quot; as transistors hit the scene.  TLAs blossomed in the 1970s and 1980s, as did made-up words, often based on trademark considerations.  Later .com, e-whatever, i-whatever, and Whatevr in the 2000s, which all seem dated now.",1396156170

An entire PvP-free world removed all of the danger of exploring, item insurance and infinite item durability repair removed all of the risk of carrying high-end gear, the Doom gauntlet added WoW-style dungeon grinding, power/stat scrolls brought in near-mandatory guild raiding, endless new classes brought serious balancing issues, veteran rewards chased off new players, countless new lands combined with dwindling players made the game more of a ghost town, etc. The entire game shifted from a social gathering that was a blast to explore, into a grind-fest treadmill.<p>I really miss the old game, but not enough to run a hacked client on a fan-made server with under 200 users that could disappear at any time.",1396155862
