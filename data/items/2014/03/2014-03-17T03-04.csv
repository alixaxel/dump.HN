You&#x27;re engaging in wordplay to avoid the obvious inferences ascribable to the very facts you&#x27;re acknowledging.<p>That is, you&#x27;re using &quot;facts&quot; to mislead in very much the same way that Monsanto does. What&#x27;s your affiliation with them or related companies?<p>Forget about the term &quot;dose dependence&quot;. I misused it in an effort to be concise. I should have used &quot;volume-dependence&quot;. The point is that it is patently true that the more of a pesticide we use in aggregate, the higher the rate of resistance to that pesticide and the more we have to use. You seem to have acknowledged that, but now you are attempting to obfuscate it.<p>Obviously, this does not mean that if we use X volume of any given pesticide, then we will get Y resistance to that pesticide. Nowhere did I state that. Actual resistance rates are obviously dependent on the properties of the specific herbicide. But, for each pesticide, the more we use, the higher the risk of resistance. Again, you seem to be acknowledging this at least tacitly via your acknowledgment where Roundup is concerned.<p>But, you are flailing about between arguments and contradicting each. On the one hand, you&#x27;re saying that GMOs such as Roundup Ready do lead to higher resistance. OTOH, this is OK because we are decreasing use of other herbicides and thus decreasing resistance there. So you are arguing both sides. To see this, answer the following: what happens when we have herbicide-resistant GMOs for every herbicide in significant use?<p>And, BTW, beyond resistance, we are using more roundup because GMOs allow the crops to tolerate more.<p>><i>The introduction of herbicide resistant GMOs has led to a reduction in the rate of herbicides applied for most crops, or approximately similar rates of less harmful herbicides applied in other crops.</i><p>Again, this is misleading because you are vascillating between discrete herbicides/GMOs and aggregate. Bottom line is that humans are consuming more glyphosate than in pre-Roundup Ready times because more of it is being used. You keep calling it safe but, as is often the case with chemicals meant to kill, the independent research is calling these safety claims into serious question. When the dose we receive from any given herbicide keeps going up, we eventually cross a threshold wherein even the industry-sponsored research is little more than a wild guess. The result is that we just don&#x27;t know  when we&#x27;ve reached a tipping point until it&#x27;s too late.<p>It boggles my mind when scientists, of all people, show little regard for the complexity of the human organism and make such cavalier statements about the safety of consuming chemicals that are intended to kill. If their presumably increased understanding of the delicate balance and complex chemical processes within the human body isn&#x27;t enough to warrant a bit more respect, it seems that history should be.",1395028167

You say that all languages (aside from a bit of backpedaling in the footnotes) are descended from FORTRAN, which is a pretty bold claim to make, but the justification you provide seems to reduce &quot;descended from&quot; to a mostly meaningless &quot;probably borrowed some ideas from&quot; that is hard to base any value judgement on. Surely not all ideas in FORTRAN were misguided!<p>The whole rest of the article continues in this pattern, distracting from basically good points with brash and sometimes bizarre (from my perspective, at least) statements that seem to belie a wide but very spotty understanding of computing history. Granted, it&#x27;s been chaotic and not terribly well-documented, but that ought to give one second thoughts about writing with such a definitive and dismissive tone.<p>I want to repeat that I agree with the general premise, and I think that it&#x27;s unfortunate that I came away from the article feeling like I <i>disagreed</i> with it due to the problems noted above. I had to re-read the intro to remember the intent. Hopefully this criticism is accepted in the constructive sense in which I offer it, as I think that there&#x27;s some great insight there that could be more effectively conveyed.",1395028024

So I have to keep this short.<p>>  the size of the LIF is much, much smaller than the predicted distance, extrapolated from within the LIF, that it will take for the horizon to catch the probe.<p>I&#x27;m discussing the simple picture in the blog and its caption. Not a more complex puzzle, or Laws J & K. The cloud of particles is demanded by GR to be splitting in two along the horizon, when all the particles above the horizon are let to be escaping. This &quot;splitting in two&quot; contradicts the equivalence principle and occurs in every arbitrarily short period of time in the life of frame X. There is always an arbitrarily short duration of time available in any LIF, so frame X&#x27;s size in spacetime is <i>not</i> an issue.<p>When you talk about &quot;global coordinate chart&quot; and a &quot;lightlike curve&quot; you&#x27;re being unnecessarily complex, I say. We&#x27;re talking a simple inertial frame of special relativity here, plus one basic prediction of GR as it relates to the horizon, namely that everything below the horizon moves inexorably inward toward the singularity. This discussion can be much simpler than you&#x27;re making it. After reading your explanation I shouldn&#x27;t be left wondering which sentence in the blog is incorrect or doesn&#x27;t follow from its premises.<p>The cloud splits in two and that&#x27;s a &quot;bug&quot;. To prove the blog wrong you need to show that the cloud <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> split in two, that all the cloud&#x27;s particles can in fact move outward in formation. Can you do that in a way that clearly shows which sentence in the picture&#x27;s caption is incorrect?",1395027969

Many objects are so far from us that it will take much more than 13.7 billion years for their photons to reach us. And no matter how distant the objects that will &#x27;come into view&#x27; in the future, the light that appears the most distant to us will always be the cosmic microwave background radiation.<p>So here we find ourselves, Earthly observers, sitting in the center of a sphere with an apparent radius of 13.7 billion lightyears - called the observable universe - at the edge of which we can see the immediate aftermath of the Big Bang.

Every comment I&#x27;ve seen thus far doesn&#x27;t seem to grasp that this is MANDATORY before you have the ability to finish installing a new bootloader.  This is how UEFI <i>protects itself</i> from unauthorized OS signing!<p>I have my own custom EFI vars set up with grub2 running on a GPT partition table, all booting beside windows, as purely as the air you breathe, and I&#x27;m loading custom Linux kernels daily and haven&#x27;t ran into an issue since I originally set it up.  Grub2 itself is my primary boot partition, which can then jump into the windows boot manager on the other disk.<p>Grub2 itself has the capacity to act as a custom-signed EFI boot partition (Not sure if I&#x27;ve got the wording on that correct -- but the gist is there!).  This means grub can be what your bios looks for the signature from.  You don&#x27;t absolutely need your kernel to be signed, provided you can get a signature produced from grub, OR you have the ability to write one while in a signed O/S.<p>IF you want the easiest approach, look no further than any Linux distribution that purchased a key to find such a  signed environment that permits the further writing of EFI variables.<p>Or, even easier -- just write then boot grub 2&#x27;s EFI-signed bootloader to a usb key to get started.  After that, writing a new OS entry to UEFI should be the most straightforward thing to do in the world!<p>*(You can even boot any kernel in the world with such a signed grub2 USB disk!)",1395027082

With a voice call, the representative is on the line with you until your problem is resolved. With a text message, the rep would have to start helping somebody else if you took too long to reply, and may not be able to get back to you for a long time. Since they have no way of knowing how soon you&#x27;ll reply, or if you&#x27;ll reply at all, they can&#x27;t just sit there idly waiting for your reply for a couple of minutes. And if a rep gets a large number of slow repliers queued up at once, he&#x27;d have to mentally juggle several different conversations and couldn&#x27;t give any of them his full attention. Which caller gets priority? The one who you&#x27;re currently texting with or the one who just came back after five minutes? What if a caller hasn&#x27;t replied for a while and it&#x27;s the end of the rep&#x27;s shift?<p>Also, is there any way to route text messages through a call center so that a caller could text a single customer support number instead of having to know the number of the next available service representative?<p>One more thing: SMS messages get lost at a rate of 1 to 5%[1], so you&#x27;re going to have a lot of irate customers wondering why they never received a reply.

One can define such things in a number of ways, but one way is to describe the relation via a formal language such as the lambda calculus. The lambda calculus is not technically a &quot;programming language&quot;, it is a formal system of meaningless symbols and a set of rules for forming, manipulating, and eliminating them.<p>Although there is no fixed relation between reduction rules in the lambda calculus and physical resources in a computer, one can still compare the number of reduction steps required to determine which form in the co-domain of a function defined in the lambda calculus corresponds to a specific form in its domain, and this will provide a reasonable stand-in for comparisons between resource usage of similar computer programs.<p>So, really, computation is not completely foreign to mathematics, and mathematical functions and &quot;computing functions&quot; are not completely different animals, just... distantly related? Some languages are more mathematical in their approach than others.",1395025969
