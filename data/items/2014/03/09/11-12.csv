Europeans have traditionally found this kind of pre-occupation with monetary success somewhat crass or trivial.<p>> Europeans don’t realize that if a company that went from nothing to connecting 7 million homes is not celebrated...<p>That&#x27;s total BS. You dont need a culture of fanatical adoration of business success for their to be successful businesses.<p>> if a company ... is not celebrated ... we will not get young Europeans on the right track<p>It really worrisome how these people have to go around reminding everyone how amazing they are.

I do think that discoverability is very difficult to do on 5&quot; screens but that doesn&#x27;t mean discoverability must be equally bad on a 10&quot; or 20&quot; or 24&quot; screen.<p>Microsoft can&#x27;t just do a u-turn and go back to the traditional desktop. What they need to do is to scrap the old desktop altogether and use the screen real estate that&#x27;s there.<p>Why not implement a fully featured tiling window manager? On a small screen, you see only one or two tiles and you have no discoverability. On a larger screen you get extra tiles that show available commands and help text.

7368208,comment,7368137,7368181,19,0,Hermel,,,"This effect even gets reinforced by the European journalists: a German speaking journalist will read German and English sources. A Spanish journalist will read Spanish and English sources, etc. Having the &quot;lingua franca&quot; is a huge asset for the Anglosphere. It not only affects the flow of news, it also leads to cultural dominance (everyone watches Hollywood movies, but European movies are primarily shown in their home countries, same goes for music). I would say that average Jean in many European countries knows more about the Anglosaxon legal system than their own one - just because they get exposed to TV shows about US lawyers all the time. The French try to fight that influence - but I think resistance is futile. Instead, the Europeans should try to find angles to inject their own views into the English news & culture stream. This leads to one large globalized, multi-cultural soup of values - but that&#x27;s better than an Anglosaxon dominated soup of values.

We all knew &#x27;network effects&#x27; even of we did not know the phrase, hence, if you were in the Sinclair ecosystem and only owned a ZX81 you wanted either a ZX Spectrum (48K) so you could play the same games as your friends or a BBC Micro like what the school had. Similarly, if you owned a Commodore Vic20 then a Commodore 64 was the way to go. Beyond these few brands there were plenty of Ataris (400/800), Ti/994a&#x27;s, Dragon 32&#x27;s and so on, none of which had &#x27;network effects&#x27;.<p>The UK home computing market morphed into Amigas, Acorn Risc machines, Ataris and the Amstrad versions of the Sinclair machines, at which time Microsoft were still trying to foist a tarted up version of MSX onto the marketplace, but nobody was buying even if the MSX machines were very nice. They just never managed the &#x27;network effects&#x27; that the popular machines had.<p>History is rhyming with itself as far as Microsoft is concerned, their Windows Phone is entering a crowded marketplace that is settled. People with old Android phones go for new Android phones, people with old Apple phones go for new Apple phones. It is that simple. Regardless of the benefits of Windows Phone it  just does not matter. They can tart it up all they like but nobody cares.",1394363773

The fact that it is perpetrated by other children instead of an adult makes no difference to the victim.<p>I will say that schools <i>can</i> do something about this, and some of them do. My son has been the victim of bullies on occasion, and both his primary and secondary school have been very supportive. Nipping this kind of thing in the bud makes it clear that such behaviour is not accepted. It is when it becomes part of the culture that you have a real problem.<p>One option is to go to the law. Child abuse is against the law, and schools have a duty of care. Hitting someone is assault regardless of where it happens or who does it, so if you are assaulted and the school does nothing then go to the police. Document incidents for a few months, take the document to the school authorities, and if they do nothing then talk to a lawyer.",1394363253
