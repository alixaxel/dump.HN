O1 approval is fast (premium processing is about two weeks). In my experience, document preparation is depending on two major factors: \n1. applicant&#x27;s records such as media coverage, publications/citations, reference letters, and awards. I fortunately accumulated some evidences for each of these when doing my PhD. I only have less than half of reference letters compared to my friends who got their EB1, so I think media and awards could be equally important. \n2. experienced attorney who can put together a 2-inch-thick document in a short time (of course, it depends on the applicant to gather the materials).",1395114765

The class of visas you&#x27;re alluding to (O-1 visas) are for special achievement in a recognized field particularly in sports, entertainment or academia. The individual sponsors their own visa, and makes a case of it through letters of recommendation and appeal. It&#x27;s not enough to be a &quot;founder of X company&quot;, there&#x27;s a minimum about of press, articles published, conferences attended and awards/prizes INCLUDING awards from the applicant&#x27;s home country (so they must have international level achievement)<p>What class of visas would investors be allowed to have sway over? The govt. could make a case that a startup visa is a loophole around HI-B1 because it doesn&#x27;t nessescarily demonstrate a skillset <i>not already owned</i> by an American. In effect, for your case to work, YC would have to prove that entrepreneurship is not an American quality.<p>The other option is O-1 visas, but that assumes that your founders have existing press/awardship already given in their home country.",1395114745

This is especially true, given that I can consistently perform less well on, for example, the spatial portion of an IQ test than the logical portion. Unless you&#x27;re willing to say that there is not any other important component (such as say, oratory intelligence) to someone&#x27;s ability to perform, or be intelligent. My skepticism says it&#x27;s likely that, in fact, there is a positive correlation between how good you are at manipulating objects and math and your IQ score, whereas there&#x27;s little to no correlation between emotional acuity and IQ. But if, due to your social skills and emotional abilities, you&#x27;re not able to cut it in the arts or humanities, you&#x27;re more likely to become an engineer. Which tells you nothing of what types of majors &quot;roundly&quot; intelligent  people (i.e. those with relatively equal IQ and non-IQ intelligence) choose.<p>2. Your source doesn&#x27;t even support your assertion, at least if you&#x27;re claiming non-engineers, in the same companies as engineers, are on average less intelligent.

Many of the projects that bundle Sass or Compass in a pretty GUI are making use of this initial work.<p>* Building a number of OSS libraries (<a href=""https://github.com/tokaido"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/tokaido</a>) that enabled an application-isolated workflow like Pow with many fewer failure modes.<p>* Integration with popular tools that people use in development (redis-server and Postgres.app)<p>This process took longer than I expected (a year, rather than more like six months), and at the end of it, I had run out of work-time time to devote to the project. I turned my attention to nurturing a small community of people who could make Tokaido an open-source project that could be community maintained once we ship.<p>Andrés Robalino, in particular, helped me squash a number of important bugs that I was having trouble with (including a bug that was triggering occasional 100% CPU usage on some machines), and has cleaned up the process of building static Ruby and added a bunch of polish to the UI.<p>Tokaido has definitely not been my finest, quickest open-source turnaround, and it&#x27;s fair for people who don&#x27;t like me to use it as an example of my failures.

Open source .NET proved that C# is a great language outside of Windows and it wouldn&#x27;t take much money for Microsoft to acquire it. Throwing Microsoft&#x27;s considerable resources at Xamarin would allow Microsoft to gain a huge foothold in cross platform development, and thus would be much more likely to have developers port their apps to Windows.<p>Microsoft used to embrace, extend, and extinguish their competition before they got too big and too afraid of their own shadow(and shareholders) with Windows and Office. Honestly, it makes total sense for Microsoft to acknowledge they are running a distant #3 and get as many developers behind them as they can. Make Microsoft the place where real hackers go to write code.<p>Buying Xamarin is embracing. As is maybe a Nokia Android phone. Microsoft needs to make their own &quot;better&quot; version of Android with their own services and get people hooked on that. Then make the &quot;best&quot; version of Android called Windows A. It&#x27;s Windows, on Android. Windows A&#x27;s best features would be closed source and patented.

That money pumped into the market only serves to raise prices.  Houses are built larger and more expensively than they otherwise would be because the buyers are able to pay more.<p>If there were no mortgage loans available, the market would be producing a greater number of cheaper homes for sale, and a greater number of rental homes for investors, with more economic separation between those markets.  The rich man outbidding you for property would have to actually assume ownership of it, and would shoulder some risk of carrying vacant rental units.

Debt is a trap laid by the wily for the foolish.  But it persists because the practice nestles snugly into a Nash equilibrium.  The practice is not at an absolute maximum, but neither player alone can improve his position by making a different move.<p>The only way for the erstwhile borrower to win is to form a cartel able to punish anyone who takes a loan to pay for a good or service too scarce to supply everyone in the cartel.

Hitting on you!<p>Compliment you on what you&#x27;re wearing?  Hitting on you!  Objectifying you!  Noticing that you are a partially-physical entity!  THE HORROR!<p>Ask you about your projects?  Flirting with you!<p>Make a <i>suggestion</i> about your project?  Mansplaining at you!<p>Men have to navigate a constantly changing, and VERY hazardous minefield every time we talk to you.  I&#x27;m really sorry (really, genuinely, that is not sarcasm) that sometimes we get it wrong, or sometimes we just forego trying at all and stay quite around you.  A lot of it is really just because we don&#x27;t want to mess it up and make you angry.  Women have a LOT of power over men in these situations, and if we screw up even a tiny tiny bit, it can ruin our lives.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://readwrite.com/2014/01/24/github-meritocracy-rug#awesm=~oyPjTP04I01sg5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readwrite.com/2014/01/24/github-meritocracy-rug#awesm...</a><p>[2]:<a href=""http://banbossy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://banbossy.com</a>",1395112836

The amount of time between &quot;Kernel, I need this time stamp.&quot; and &quot;PID 1337 here is your time stamp&quot; is not instant, and is not constant.

The downside is that sometimes you end up having to continually prove yourself at various points in your life.<p>Violence is not my preferred method of retaliation though - violence in itself does not prove a point, except that I am not willing to be trampled on.  It has also backfired on me in the past at times (ex. fracturing my hand while in boot camp from retaliating over getting punched in a stressful moment - the initial punch I took was due to some mythical blame that I was at fault for the platoon getting jacked up).  Sometimes you cannot do anything else when a bully attacks you directly - the only thing such people understand is meeting power with power, that is the state of their brutish mind.  They don&#x27;t ascribe to the fundamental premise of mutual respect, even when you have not done anything that should have provoked it.  You&#x27;re just used as an excuse to vent out frustrations over self-deficiencies or failures.<p>This is why we, the new privileged class of tech, should be doing everything to abet this behavior, and show that we should be welcoming - we should be showing that there is a better way than repeating the same old animalistic behavior in a new form.

The &quot;Hulse-Taylor&quot; binary star system is a pair of neutron stars orbiting very close to each other (the pair of neutron stars orbiting each other would fit inside of our own Sun). Because the stars are pulsars it&#x27;s possible to measure the orbit with extremely high precision over time. One prediction of the theory of gravitational waves is that the emission of gravitational waves actually removes small amounts of energy from an orbital system over time (like a drag force). But normally these amounts are so small as to be inconsequential even over extremely long periods, but with very dense, very massive, very closely orbiting objects the amount is much higher. And the result is that it causes the orbits to degrade over time, as the stars slowly spiral toward each other. This is a very consistent effect.<p>Here&#x27;s a graph showing the prediction of the existence of gravitational waves relative to the observations of the change of period of the Hulse-Taylor binary: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PSR_B1913%2B16_period_shift_graph.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PSR_B1913%2B16_period_shif...</a> The tiny horizontal lines on the red dots are the error bars of the observations. You can see how perfectly the observations line up with theory.<p>Also, it&#x27;s likely that gravitational waves will be observed directly within the next several years. There have been experiments attempting to do so but none of them have been sensitive enough to detect the most likely of the strongest signals of gravitational radiation. The improvements to those experiments that will come online within the next decade or so should be able to do so however.",1395112232
