7495800,comment,7494015,7494015,2,0,vidarh,,,"So here&#x27;s an alternative view of how he could&#x27;ve achieved what he wanted:<p>- Use a broker that supports a timeout on the messages. Many do. E.g. beanstalkd lets you reserve a message for a specified time period, otherwise it goes back on the queue automatically. You can let the server knows if you need longer to finish. But a locked process will not hold on to a job.<p>- Use a timeout on the crawlers. A hard timeout like alarm() that causes the process to <i>die</i> if it fails. Run them under a process monitor that&#x27;ll respawn them.<p>- Have the crawler or a separate system monitor queue depth, and slow down / alert/ throw errors if the queue goes above a certain depth.<p>All of this is trivial.<p>If introducing a broker takes the whole app with it if its fails, then you&#x27;re doing it wrong: Unless you <i>need</i> in-order guaranteed delivery of messages, making a message queue resilient to failures is trivial: Just add more of them, and let the client talk to all of them. If you need in-order delivery, then a active-passive setup is easy enough too. Put the queue in a synchronously replicated database if you can&#x27;t afford to lose any of them. So his argument about failures, is an argument against letting &quot;inexperienced programmers&quot; set up systems with single points of failure, not against message brokers.<p>The irony of this is that his solution is that it&#x27;s great when the process generating the messages to queue can be run on a single, reliable system, by someone who will notice when that system fails and recover from it. But you&#x27;ve now stuffed your crawler full of state, and created a central point of failure. Just what he complained about.<p>The broker solution is great when you want scale - you can multiply the number of brokers. You can multiply the number of machines the workers run on. You can multiply the number of machines processing the crawled documents. It is also great when you want resilience for the same reason: By decoupling, it makes it easier.<p>If you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> that scale, then go for the simpler solution. But if you do need that scale, then his solution isn&#x27;t a solution at all.<p>If you introduce a broker, and your queues start growing out of control. Guess what? You have a scaling problem you would likely have without the broker too. Only in a decoupled system you have a much easier way out: Add more machines/VMs with workers; add more brokers.<p>Don&#x27;t feel you have a way of controlling it? This is what your monitoring and orchestration systems should be doing. Queues over a certain threshold? Trigger an alert, and optionally spin up an exra VM.",1396176509

The distributed block-chain technology has implications far wider than a basic ledger. For example, I&#x27;m quite excited by namecoin, a distributed DNS. I share your enthusiasm about extending bitcoin&#x27;s technology to create a distributed, general-purpose trust network.<p>However, I am quite confused about strangecoin. Maybe the whole thread is going over my head and I&#x27;m lacking an Explain-Like-I&#x27;m-Five description of your idea. I&#x27;d love to be a supporter, but I don&#x27;t see how you can build a trust network around something as complicated as this. Could you explain how, even in a vague sense, strangecoin could act as a reputation system?<p>It seems like bitcoin itself works as a pretty great trust network. Just look at the mess surrounding MtGox: everybody seems to have a clear understanding that MtGox is totally culpable, despite the claims of transaction malleability attacks. Because the block-chain is entirely available for analysis, the financial activity of all organizations can be traced, which can reliably verify trust.",1396176207

If they are, I bigger offer will soon follow. Everyone has a price and these cashed up companies have deeper pockets than any company has ever had.  The near inevitability of this acquisition (hinted at by Carmack) is IMO the significant element.<p>In this environment, Google could have gotten near their IPO value years earlier from an acquiring company.

7495738,comment,7494500,7494732,3,0,revorad,,,"2 of the most common reasons that make people think mods are randomly killing stories which they don&#x27;t like:<p>1. People sharing direct links to their HN submission, asking their friends to upvote. I believe the HN algorithm auto-flags such posts.<p>Most people don&#x27;t know about this, so they assume the worst (PG killed it because he didn&#x27;t like the article/author). Those who do know about this now get around by telling people &quot;Go to /newest and look for my submission&quot;.<p>Most times people just want their friends to upvote the submission, but sometimes people are genuinely seeking comments on their submission.<p>I don&#x27;t know the solution but the current way of dealing with this is too heavy-handed and causes a broken user experience.<p>[EDIT: What if you merely reduced the weight of votes from direct link visits, instead of flagging the post?]<p>2. Users can themselves flag stories off the homepage! Again, it appears that most people don&#x27;t know about this. So, even a story which got to the homepage in a legit way, sometimes gets flagged off because enough people think it&#x27;s lame. This has happened a number of times for controversial topics like sexism in tech.<p>Once again, outsiders assume it&#x27;s because HN mods are horrible people.<p>Finally, I think PG&#x27;s inclination has always been to fix HN&#x27;s problems with software, but what it needs is more human solutions, not more code.<p>Do things that don&#x27;t scale ;)",1396174357

A lot of games and demos have quirks in the emulators and there are still enough random crashes for me to not to enjoy emulation too much even though I would want to.<p>Edit: is the disclaimer crap on top mandatory at IndieGogo? I would not imagine anyone from Spain caring about that; I don&#x27;t anyway; you cannot do much in the EU with that kind of nonsense. It&#x27;s an honest question though as I don&#x27;t really like disclaimers and am wondering if this is something Indiegogo makes you do.<p>I&#x27;ll sponsor the project anyway as it&#x27;s a new ARM gadget, it looks nice and it&#x27;s made in my favorite country :) If not for emulating Amiga, then for other hacking purposes.<p>Edit: does anyone know why emulation is still not perfect though on modern, very fast machines? I know it&#x27;s hard to do the timing, but random crashes and some stuff still not working should be ironed out by now? (Example; I haven&#x27;t found an emulator which can do SOTB 1 fully ; it always just crashes somewhere in the game; it definitely doesn&#x27;t do that on real hardware).",1396174272
