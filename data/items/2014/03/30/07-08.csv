The tech community is not a representative sample of Facebook&#x27;s user-base.<p>Indeed they aren&#x27;t, but who do you think designers interact with on a day to day basis? I think that the tech community&#x27;s thoughts are important as they influence other tech people&#x27;s thoughts and, therefore, might shift them away from reality.<p>> And looking good and working well are two completely different things.<p>Again agreed, which is why using metrics is a sound approach.

7495538,comment,7494826,7495285,4,0,RyanZAG,,,"It&#x27;s an interesting phenomenon that occurs on HN. It&#x27;s fairly easy to explain. Each HN user that sees this post has a chance to view and comment on the post depending on his interests. A Python developer would be likely to simply skip this post, while a Go developer would be highly likely to view this post as he has an interest in using his Go knowledge on more platforms. That means we have a highly skewed distribution of people upvoting and downvoting comments on any language specific article.<p>For example, if there are 10 Go developers for every 100 Python developers viewing HN, in a thread such as this one, there may be 9 Go developers for every 5 Python developers. This means that a large percentage of viewers of any critical Go posts in a Go thread are Go developers. They will downvote that critical post almost regardless of content.<p>This is not a knock on Go developers, merely standard tribalism. There is an identical effect in Haskell, Ruby, or even Perl discussions. There is probably no solution - if you value karma, I recommend not posting critical comments about a language in a post specific to that thread. You should rather save those comments for more general threads about programming theory, etc. If you don&#x27;t care about karma (and you shouldn&#x27;t), then please keep posting.",1396165777

7495513,comment,7494826,7495219,1,0,wyager,,,">Where does Go fall short as a language for mobile?<p>Go falls short as a language for mobile in the same ways it falls short as a language for most things. It&#x27;s simply not a very well-designed language.<p>Let me give you a few examples:<p>Terrible support for generic programming. Read almost any production go code and you see many instances of the interface{} type. This is basically equivalent to up-casting to Object in java, or passing things around as null* in C++. In many cases, that&#x27;s the best you can do. All the type-safety of Python with five times the verbosity.<p>Many features are built-in, non-extensible language directives. Take the `range` operator. `range` only supports built-in types like maps, slices, and chans. You want to range over a tree? Too bad. Want to range over a graph? Too bad. Want to range over a queue or a linked list? Hmm, well too bad, or maybe wrap the queue or LL with a chan, write a helper function, range over that, and watch your performance go to shit.<p>Go was built with one purpose in mind; building web services. It&#x27;s good at that. But really, the only things Go has going for it are decent threading primitives and a solid standard library.<p>So the answer is this: Go is not a bad language, but it is certainly no better than existing languages for writing mobile applications. Go offers nothing that would make me, if I were a mobile app developer, want to switch from Java or Objective-C. In fact, it&#x27;s missing a lot of things that I might consider important.",1396164679

Everyone enjoys a talking HEAD, from young to old. Taste, see, smell, and &quot;pain&quot; with a HEAD. Experience every emotion known to the HEAD. And if you already have a HEAD, remember what the HEADS say: &quot;Two HEADS are better than one!&quot;<p>Everyone enjoys a talking HEAD. Every minute is different from the next minute in incredible thought-chaos of a HEAD. And every single HEAD is different!<p>HEADS are so funny. Listen to the limbless talking HEAD talk about &quot;Freedom,&quot; &quot;Death,&quot; &quot;Beauty,&quot; and &quot;God-Father.&quot; Make the HEAD fall in &quot;Love&quot; with you. Any HEAD can be made to &quot;Love,&quot; if training manual instructions are carefully observed. Watch the worn-out HEAD die, talking, talking, talking till the moment in decays. Indeed, it is not an exaggeration to say HEADS are so funny.<p>Taste, see, smell, and &quot;pain&quot; with a HEAD. Every HEAD purchaser receives absolutely free a &quot;Life-time&quot; supply of &quot;Food.&quot; Put &quot;Food&quot; in the HEAD&#x27;s <i>Mouth</i>, then insert consensual Apparat into <i>Left Collarbone</i>. You will taste every molecule of the <i>Mouth&#x27;s</i> &quot;Food.&quot; Only those who have &quot;eaten&quot; with a <i>Mouth</i> can understand the incredible sensations of &quot;Food.&quot;<p><i>Left Collarbone</i> is likewise Input/Output source for <i>Right Eye</i> and <i>Left Eye</i>. See the strange little world of the <i>Right Eye</i>, looking at <i>you</i>! See through the <i>Left Eye</i> too! Then see through both the <i>Right Eye</i> and th e<i>Left Eye</i> together. Every Exo-Export HEAD has <i>two</i> eyes. Don&#x27;t accept less!<p><i>Left Collarbone</i> is likewise Input/Output source for <i>Nose</i>. Now, with the new, improved HEAD you can experience the disconcerting primeval world of &quot;Sex,&quot; as the center of the new HEAD&#x27;s sex-tropic response is removed from obsolete and unsightly sacral area and redirected to the graceful <i>Nose</i>. Just one more reason why two HEADS are better than one!<p><i>Left Collarbone</i> is likewise Input/Output source for &quot;pain&quot;-sensitive <i>Chin</i>. Throughout the galaxies there are creatures, often the most insignificant, that can experience the famous &quot;Negative Pleasure,&quot; and now with a HEAD you can too! The new, improved HEAD is thirty percent more sensitive to &quot;pain,&quot; thanks to refinements in the <i>Chin</i>.<p><i>Left Collarbone</i> is likewise Input/Output source and control center for <i>Adam&#x27;s Apple</i>. Nothing is easier than to take over your HEAD&#x27;s talking- function. Amuse your friends by talking through your own HEAD! What could be funnier than to talk to another HEAD that thinks <i>you</i> are just a HEAD too?<p>Everyone enjoys a talking HEAD, from young to old. Even more fun than talking-function of the HEAD is thought-function. Insert compassional Apparat into <i>Right Collarbone</i>, and experience every emotion known to the HEAD. <i>You</i> will feel the HEAD&#x27;s amazing &quot;Love.&quot; <i>You</i> will be paralyzed with the HEAD&#x27;s consuming &quot;Fear&quot; of pain and of its own inescapable death. <i>You</i> will hate your own self -- perhaps the most exciting sensation of all.<p>HEADS are educational. Everyone should have his own HEAD to grow up with. HEADS provide an easy and stimulating introduction to basic concepts of xeno-language and xeno-culture. Each HEAD is given a thorough grounding in the astonishing cultural traditions of its autochthonous planet. A third of a lifetime is devoted to the education of every Exo-Export HEAD.<p>HEADS are perfectly safe for the young. The sharp, skeletal teeth are extracted from each HEAD&#x27;s <i>Mouth</i> at the time of assembly and refitted with harmless, hydraulic pseudo-teeth.<p>Many designers consider HEADS to be an attractive addition to the decor of one&#x27;s environment, especially in arrangements with contrasting xeno-flora and xeno-fauna. For the fashion-conscious HEADS are available now in a range of natural tincts from brown through pink. When treated with new, special-formula Fungi-X, HEADS can also be cultivated in more agreeable colors, though fungifying processes will abbreviate markedly the lifetime of the HEADS so treated.<p>Everyone should have his own HEAD, and now everyone can! Thanks to the diminished <i>Chest</i> volume of the new, improved HEAD, the result of recent advances in biominiaturization, HEADS are cheaper than every before. They eat less and take up less space too! So why don&#x27;t you buy your new HEAD today?<p>Any HEAD you buy from Exo-Export is guaranteed to be the native handicraft of its autochthonous planet, where bioengineering has long been practiced by the wild-four-limbed progrnitors and manufacturers of the HEADS.<p>There are a thousand laughs in store for you in the new, improved HEAD. Why don&#x27;t you buy your new HEAD today? Why don&#x27;t you buy your new HEAD today? Why don&#x27;t you buy your new HEAD today?<p>Only 49.95 from Exo-Export Monopolies.<p>Copyright 1968 by Thomas M.

7495495,comment,7494682,7494682,6,0,jgon,,,"We all bring our own perspectives and experience to our day to day lives and our perspectives, and so I make no bones here about the following being the fruits of my own perspective. Please keep that in mind as you read the following and judge its content.<p>I myself have recently undergone the acquisition of my company, a private company that was well regarded in the field it was operated, by a large multi-billion mult-national.  When I read Carmack&#x27;s comments I feel pulled in two different directions.<p>On the one hand, I am old enough to have grown up with Castle Wolfenstein and Doom being formative experiences in my life on the computer, and my life in general.  I can still remember downloading to the first Quake shareware, playing the original Team Fortress, and installing Navy Seals Quake long before its creator had moved onto Counter-Strike. And so Carmack is like a hero to me, he really did make an impact on my life growing up.<p>On the other hand, I see in all of his comments the same sort of sentiment that I saw in all of the upper management and senior members of my firm. They all expressed the exact same sorts of sentiments, that the acquisition would allow our company to reach the next level, giving us greater capital to expand our reach.  Of course, now that push has come to shove, actually getting some of that money to spend is proving to be a bit more difficult than they had initially imagined or been promised. It turns out that our parent company was perfectly happy to acquire us for the market position that we help and the money that we could bring in without a substantial capital infusion.  I know that the immediate argument will be that facebook will be totally different and will no doubt fund oculus to their heart&#x27;s content, but I guess it is my cynicism showing when I hear these pronouncements through the same filter I now apply to announcements from our own parent company.<p>Anyway, as I said, we all view our lives through our own filter, and maybe I am totally swayed in my views. But I can&#x27;t help but seeing the same sort of naive optimism in Carmack that permeated our organization before it came down to dollars and cents, and cheques had to be signed. And maybe, just like some in our senior management, Carmack is now older and less idealistic, and reflects this is the same way that some in my firm did, in their ability to say one thing publicly, and know something else in their heart, as long as the zeroes added up properly.  Something funny happens as you get older, I feel it happening in myself, maybe you just don&#x27;t feel as ready to go out on your shield. But I got the feeling from at least a few people in our acquisition that they knew how things would go, and were happy to say differently because it would work out better for them.<p>I don&#x27;t know where John&#x27;s head is, and so I can&#x27;t charitably assume negative things, but then again I don&#x27;t think assuming the best is any more honest or charitable, especially where facebook is concerned. I hope for the future of VR, but when I read the hopelessly positive and/or naive visions of this acquisition I can&#x27;t help but asking myself &quot;What do they know that I don&#x27;t?&quot; How can these people be that optimistic, unless they aren&#x27;t actually that positive. We&#x27;ll see how it goes, but I don&#x27;t begrudge anyone feeling pessimistic at this point, especially given the history of tech acquisitions.  We&#x27;ll see how it goes, but in my heart of hearts, I hope for another Oculus and another Palmer, maybe slightly less focused on the bottom line, bringing the promise of VR to us all.",1396163722
