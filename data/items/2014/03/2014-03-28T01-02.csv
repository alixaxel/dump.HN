If such a large proportion of the population has a &#x27;condition&#x27; is it really a condition or perhaps just how we (as a species) are?

Around 10%-12% of people are left-handed and (I believe) that historically this was also something that people tried to &#x27;fix&#x27;. I doubt many of us think twice about these anymore.<p>To a sibling comment that suggested what if 1 in 5 boys were born deaf, I&#x27;d say that the world would be a <i>vastly</i> different place. So different that we may not even entertain such a question. If, instead, 1/5th of boys were <i>beginning</i> to be born deaf, there would be a medical emergency.

Seems like it would make scheduling much more difficult because you now need to make sure that that the results you need for each instruction are in the order in the belt you need, and you have to be able to execute any order of instruction types. The mill can run fast partly because and instruction can use any result on the belt, and similar instructions are grouped together making decode simpler (from memory, they have two separate decoders and each instruction has all say arith instructions grouped and decoded by one decode, and all the others decoded by the other).<p>Basically, I don&#x27;t see how you can use what you suggest to do, in one instruction:<p><pre><code>    [ add positions 7 and 5 | multiply positions 7 and 2 | call f on 4  and 5 | branch to foo if position 3 was LT else bar ]\n</code></pre>\nending up with the belt<p><pre><code>    [ [7]+[5], [7]*[2], f([4],[5]) ... ]\n</code></pre>\nor whatever you like.

That&#x27;s where their pride and satisfaction comes from.<p>The startup people care about end user experience, how good the PR is, and ultimately how numbers matter more than everything else.<p>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a wrong or right vision - it&#x27;s two very different communities.<p>Indie game devs dream of making amazing games with other talented, inspiring people - and as long as they make enough money to live not too uncomfortably, they&#x27;re fine. Their biggest dream is to receive an IGF award and see their game on Steam. Maybe make enough money to be able to start a studio with a bunch of their friends, but definitely not to &quot;scale&quot; to EA-size.<p>Startup people dream of growing their company to Facebook size, making billions of dollars, scaling, and being on Techcrunch.<p>It&#x27;s two very different communities, and it&#x27;s fun to see the two worlds collide.<p>Addendum: if you feel like this post is vindictive, bitter, etc.- remember: the best way to interpret a view different than yours is to understand that there is a worldview in which those statements are perfectly coherent, logical, and meaningful.

ADHD is very treatable, but untreated, it can easily lead to other comorbidities that are much more difficult to treat (such as depression)<p>The most dangerous part of this is that it seems to imply ADHD is over-diagnosed in men (boys), when it&#x27;s just as possible that ADHD is under-diagnosed in women (girls).<p>Girls diagnosed with 314.10 (Attention Deficit Disorder, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive) tend to exhibit fewer &quot;traditional&quot; symptoms of hyperactivity than boys with the same diagnosis. This isn&#x27;t to say that the diagnosis is wrong - it&#x27;s just that hyperactivity manifests in many ways - physical restlessness, &quot;bouncing off the walls&quot;, etc. is only one.<p>> The interesting thing is I never asked any of these people whether ADHD is real. But their defensiveness is understandable. ADHD isn&#x27;t strep throat—there&#x27;s no culture, no test. To find out if you have it, or if your son has it, or if your daughter has it, you just need a human being to say so—a physician or a psychiatrist—and that makes some people skeptical<p>This describes the <i>entire</i> field of psychiatry. While there are certainly some people who are  who would distrust the field, I would be very wary of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.<p>And of all disorders, ADHD is actually significantly easier to test for systematically than most psychological/psychiatric disorders (such as depression). The main problem is that the tests to do so are very expensive (well into the thousands of dollars), and most insurance plans won&#x27;t cover it.<p>> Ned Hallowell once famously said that stimulants were &quot;safer than aspirin,&quot; a statement he has since backed off of. (&quot;That&#x27;s almost a preposterous statement for anyone to say,&quot; says Saltarelli.)<p>So, we have a complete lowbrow dismissal of what is actually a very reasonable statement. In the end, it&#x27;s impossible to compare <i>any</i> two drugs for safety because there are so many factors that come into play, but to the extent that one can make a pairwise comparison, this is actually a very well-supported statement.",1395970155

And if most people do not understand the point right away, they may not endorse it.<p>Some people are creative with their use of language, or are non-native English speakers, and may not be able to effectively articulate what may well be a very interesting idea or important concept that adds to the conversation. Alone such a comment may not be useful, but child comments exploring it further may yield some excellent discussion.<p>Some comments may seem flippant, but solicitations for back-story reveal what the original commenter was really getting at.<p>One of the best things about HN is the comments, and it follows that one of the best things about any particular comment is a another comment reply.<p>~~~<p>There&#x27;s a problem you can peek at in academia, it doesn&#x27;t have a name, but it&#x27;s the reason that 125 Harvard students were caught cheating a few years ago. The problem isn&#x27;t that the students were cheating - Harvard students are not dumb and I doubt they&#x27;re particularly lazy. The problem was that <i>grading</i> had become such a low priority for a professor that the take-home final answers, that only a gradable subset of possible answers were really accepted for any question, so that grading could be done more on the number of citations than how effectively you communicated an answer. Implicitly and usually explicitly it&#x27;s understood that you cannot just give an original answer, you must give an answer relating to something that was taught in the course. This does not optimize for interesting or insightful answers, it optimizes for regurgitation. Originality becomes dangerous, since it demand deviation.<p>I fear we will run into a similar issue here. People will tailor their comments to please the endorsers that be. We will be turning inward mentally, and we will never know how much.<p>And for what? It&#x27;s true that sometimes there&#x27;s a controversial comment and it ends in a 60-comment emotive goose-chase.<p>Is that such a bad price to pay?<p>> Indeed, the only way to figure out if pending comments will work at all is empirically.<p>We <i>cannot know</i> what interesting conversations and discussions might be lost. No comment is an island, and I think this concept ignores that.<p>~~~<p>I do hope that if you turn it on it is as laser-focused as possible.

If you think watching a stardard&#x27;s body change a programming language takes too long, a city can go a half century or more before making trivial improvements to zoning code.

Even before you address tax policy, planning policy, incentives, or even change the way we construct buildings,... the way real estate projects are financed through banks with heavy fees and large equity requirements means nothing is built unless the motivation is sufficiently high and, therefore, we experience constant boom and bust.<p>To meet the housing needs of the future we need to build units everyday -- all the time -- in places of high demand like the Bay Area cities. And we need to do so in a way that we treat them are geographically special, because they are. For there to be new home construction in places like Dublin while lots sit empty in a city as naturally beautiful as Oakland&#x27;s means we are doing it wrong.<p>And, clearly, we are doing it wrong if an apartment in a CRUD low-rise complex in Dublin (granite or not) is $2/SF.

The big difference is that ccv is a computer vision library in general and Caffe is a artificial neural network library. This does mean quite a few different ways of approaching things, for example, ccv&#x27;s implementation does allow you to specify network topology, but doesn&#x27;t have a implementation of local non-weight-sharing layer (because CIFAR-10 and ImageNet doesn&#x27;t need such type of layer).<p>You can also chop off the last full connect layer and train a SVM on top of it with ccv, I actually plan to do exactly what you guys did with that and train on VOC 2012 dataset.<p>All in all, ccv 0.6 is a preliminary implementation of convnet, but it is important for a library claims to be &quot;modern&quot; to contain the said implementation.
