7488877,comment,7488554,7488554,31,0,freyrs3,,,"This strikes me as armchair philosophizing about the nature of programming language design. Programming languages are not intentionally complex in most cases, they&#x27;re complex because the problems they solve are genuinely hard and not because we&#x27;ve artificially made them that way.<p>There is always a need for two types of languages, higher level domain languages and general purpose languages. Building general purpose languages is a process of trying to build abstractions that always have a well-defined translation into something the machine understands. It&#x27;s all about the cold hard facts of logic, hardware and constraints. Domain languages on the other hand do exactly what he describes, &quot;a way of encoding thought such that the computer can help us&quot;, such as Excel or Matlab, etc. If you&#x27;re free from the constraint of having to compile arbitrary programs to physical machines and can instead focus on translating a small set of programs to an abstract machine then the way you approach the language design is entirely different and the problems you encounter are much different and often more shallow.<p>What I strongly disagree with is claiming that the complexities that plague general purpose languages are somehow mitigated by building more domain specific languages. Let&#x27;s not forget that &quot;programming&quot; runs the whole gamut from embedded systems programming in assembly all the way to very high level theorem proving in Coq and understanding anything about the nature of that entire spectrum is difficult indeed.",1396029498

Sony will do their best with console hardware, but Oculus will set the pace for what&#x27;s top of the line for consumers. If Facebook ever steps in and does something the [developer] community abhors, it should already be at the point where VR has had success and there will be competition. I&#x27;m super excited to see Abrash at Oculus; I just hope this doesn&#x27;t mean Valve&#x27;s slowing down on their work. Valve&#x27;s been working for a vendor-agnostic API/configuration for these devices in their Steamworks APIs and I really hope that we don&#x27;t end up fragmented by varying vendor-specific APIs.",1396029131

The most exclusive club in the Metaverse was The Black Sun and what made it special was that the avatars had extremely realistic, life-like expressions, enabling them to visually express emotions and thus enabling a higher form of communication (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, I haven&#x27;t read it in a decade).<p>So if we buy into the notion that social presence in VR worlds will be big, somebody&#x27;s going to have to build this.

Here is what I got on the site: <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/WvFd6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/WvFd6</a><p>First impression for me of the page is that the content is on the left, and the ads are on the right. That&#x27;s because the part I have circled in red looks like Google-style text ads. My mental ad blocker filters them out.<p>The download button I have circled in yellow then sets off alarms. It&#x27;s in what I have decided is an ad column, and the color reminds me a bit of the deceptive download ads CNET&#x27;s download.com likes to use on their site to trick people into downloading the wrong thing.<p>I return to the left column, which I have identified as the content column. The download button there, which I have circled in green, is in a place where a download button would not be unexpected. This is the one I will probably click, unless the small, greyed out, notice that it is an add for &quot;Free Zip&quot; somehow catches my attention.<p>If instead of trying to download from the front page, I click the download link at the top, we get to the second page. What I&#x27;d do there depends on how tall my browser window is. If it is tall enough to show the real download section at the bottom, my attention would be drawn to that, because it looks enough like download sections at other places (because of the layout, and because it lists versions, sizes, and mirrors).<p>However, if that ends up not visible, then I&#x27;d probably click the ad I have circled in green. This ad fits right into the flow of the content and is a place where a download link for paint.net would make sense.<p>I think pages can be classified into &quot;consumption&quot; pages and &quot;activity&quot; pages. A consumption page is a page where the reader is there to consume the content of the page. For example, a product page at an online store would be a consumption page. The reader is there to read the information about the product. The front page of the paint.net site is a consumption page.<p>An activity page is a page where you are there to perform some activity. At an online store, the checkout page would be an activity page. At the paint.net site, the download page would be an activity page.<p>Third party ads on consumption pages can be fine. People on consumption pages are often just looking, and ads give a chance to get some money from such visits. When people get to activity pages, they have usually gone beyond the just looking stage. You&#x27;ve got them on the hook, and now you want to reel them in. There should be no outside temptations or distractions put up at that point.",1396028971

This caused a decent bit of downtime on occasions.<p>I would expect these to be fixed by now, and for certain setups it simply wouldn&#x27;t be an issue, but definitely put a bit caveat in &quot;Use Puma!&quot;<p>Performance wise we saw it actually be worse than Unicorn at my former company. There were a few issues but the biggest one was no out of band GC at the time, so GC time was part of the requests and something a user saw. There were some use cases where it should have destroyed Unicorn but still strangely lagged (threaded, high IO operations. Should have been able to do far more with less since Puma continues to serve while Unicorn workers will wait).  Memory usage did seem better.<p>We ended up back on Unicorn after a few weeks of fighting. I would imagine it to be better now (no longer deal with servers at all, so no idea), but I found the dissonance between everyone heaping love on Puma at the time and the actual experience jarring.<p>It seemed like a fantastic project, but at the time only for certain projects and certain infrastructure setups while Unicorn was fairly bulletproof.<p>Of course all of this is old knowledge and with the people who are involved in the project I expect things are far better these days.

While he is technically in his right to leave at 5, he causes his team much grief and as such is not an asset.<p>Pushing to production shortly before going home is a separate issue to whether he leaves on time or not, a developer leaving on time should be expected, a developer pushing breaking changes and leaving should not.<p>The other stuff I wholeheartedly agree with.",1396027981

I said &quot;Preaching AA as a first step or a cure all is harmful to these people.&quot; I didn&#x27;t say it didn&#x27;t help some people, of course it does. I am saying if you have an addiction people jump to &quot;AA&quot; like it is a cure all or the only route. They don&#x27;t evaluate the patient to see what is right for them. Even doctors don&#x27;t do this to a great degree. There are other non-region based programs out there, they need to be considered on equal footing as AA, introducing the wrong person to AA can turn them off of getting help at all. Right now it is &quot;I have an addition&quot; then the answer is &quot;Oh well just go to AA.&quot;<p>>That is awfully convenient if you&#x27;re a fan of getting high...<p>What are you talking about?

Your co-workers have 3x as many fixes as you, but they only work 2.6x as much as you (assuming 14 hours / day × 7 days / week). By these numbers, they are 15% more effective than you are.

They&#x27;re there to get paid.<p>While most employers realize that your work isn&#x27;t (or should be) your single burning passion, it is very negative for team morale when one of the guys always flakes out when the clock hits 17 regardless of the fire in the kitchen.<p>I knew a developer who always left at exactly 17.00, because &quot;that&#x27;s what they are paying me for&quot;. On several occasions, he deployed breaking changes to production five minutes before leaving. Other devs had to come in and work very late to get the system back online. While he is technically in his right to leave at 5, he causes his team much grief and as such is not an asset.<p>The other side of the coin is that lots of software companies, really has little to no control over software development. Especially startups run by young, inexperienced guys rarely have any idea what they are doing. This is a company where crisis&#x27; occurs daily or weekly instead of  maybe once every couple of months.<p>They make up for this by rampant overtime, and excuse this with BS about being dedicated and a team player. You know you&#x27;re in such an organization if they talk about how &quot;that&#x27;s what the industry is like&quot;.<p>Your organizations work culture seem like that - very long hours and (seemingly) no extraordinary reason for coming in on Saturday.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, then leave. There&#x27;s not much that can be done except a total change of top management.<p>But if it&#x27;s a rare occurrence that they call you in on Saturday and there is a good explanation for it, then buckle up and help your team mates.",1396027562

I really believe that this has to do a lot with the individual employee/person rather than just management. Yes, I am not counting out the pointy haired bosses and all but to a <i>great</i> extent, it is up to you, the employee, to dictate how long will you be working on a given day. Sure, some of us love sitting in office because we probably have nothing better to do (been there) but learning to value your time is really underrated. People, learn to value your own time and you will suddenly see how everyone else around you respects you for that. /rant<p>Now, just to add the other side, creating value is a lot more than spending x hours in office.

But there the community is working on a better solution.<p>In particular, Aman Gupta described this very same problem and created a gem which improves out-of-band garbage collector, by only running it when it is actually necessary, and by not requiring one to turn off the normal GC. Phusion Passenger (even the open source version) already integrates with this improved out-of-band garbage collector through a configuration option. This all is described here:  <a href=""http://blog.phusion.nl/2014/01/31/phusion-passenger-now-supports-the-new-ruby-2-1-out-of-band-gc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.phusion.nl/2014/01/31/phusion-passenger-now-supp...</a><p>Just one caveat: it&#x27;s still a work in progress. There&#x27;s currently 1 known bug open that needs reviewing.<p>Besides the GC stuff, Phusion Passenger also has a very nice feature called passenger_max_requests. It allows you to automatically restart a process after it has processed the given number of requests, thereby lowering its peak memory usage. As far as I know, Unicorn and Puma don&#x27;t support this (at least not out of the box; whether there are third party tools for this, I don&#x27;t know).

This is how scary heroin is, I was addicted after the second time I picked up. With the help of a marijuana dealer, I got clean after he cut off my heroin dealer.

Change buffering for IO bound workloads:  If you are IO bound, then InnoDB change buffering is a huge, huge win.  It basically is able to reduce IO required for secondary index maintenance by a huge amount.<p><a href=""http://dev.mysql.com/doc/innodb/1.1/en/innodb-performance-change_buffering.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/innodb/1.1/en/innodb-performance-ch...</a><p>2.  InnoDB compression:  When you are space constrained (say using flash storage), then being able to compress your data is a big win.  In our case, it reduces space by around 40% which translates directly to 40% less servers required.  While you could do something like run PG on ZFS with compression, for an OLTP workload, you want the compression in the DB so that it can do a lot of work to minimize the compressing and decompressing of data.<p><a href=""https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-compression-internals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-compression-i...</a><p>3.  Clustered index:  The InnoDB PK is a clustered index.  This makes a lot of query patterns (such as range scans of the PK) very cheap.  Combined with covering indexes (which PG now has too!), you can really minimize the IO required by properly tuned queries.<p>There are a variety of smaller things as well, such as InnoDB doing logical writes to the redo log vs. PG doing full page writes, so on very high write systems, the REDO log bytes written will be dramatically less.  Also MySQL replication has traditionally been more flexible than PG, but PG has made some great strides recently, so I don&#x27;t know if I would maintain that position still.",1396026376

It&#x27;s almost useless on a cartridge-based inkjet printer, because those generally track something like &quot;pages printed&quot; to determine when they&#x27;re &quot;empty&quot;. Usually, they&#x27;re not empty at all: the manufacturer wants to make sure you have a good experience rather than wring out every last drop. Some laser systems will track actual toner usage, and thus could benefit from cheaper fonts; some won&#x27;t, since they estimate like the cheap inkjets. As you get bigger, and load your ink in bulk, then actual usage savings starts to really work.<p>So generally: Mass-printed forms you can save ink based on font. Office printing, maybe.<p>And, yes, ink does get much much cheaper in bulk. If the savings calculations are based on consumer inkjet prices, they&#x27;re way inflated.",1396026346

I was 10 so my apps were very basic.<p>Next, I used to play a game called Graal Online, which used two scripting languages (v1 and v2). I learned both, the second introducing more,  important programming concepts. This was fun, however I became disillusioned by having to pay $$$ to create content for the game and further my knowledge of the language. This did keep me hooked for a whole as I was amazed at how easy it was to essentially create whole new games with a complex set of assets and MMO capabilities.<p>I found picking up PHP very easy after the above. I was similarly amazed by how easy it was to create dynamic websites. I was also amazed I could do it for free and without doing anything shady.<p>I learned several other languages after this but a good couple of years ago, I have put more emphasis on concepts, ideas,  paradigms, how things fit together. I do notice a pattern of amazement and then a burst forward in my skills. Recently, I&#x27;ve been amazed by Smalltalk, it feels like just learning a little bit has helped me program in OOP languages that bit better.<p>One skill I need to master above all is finishing what I start.
