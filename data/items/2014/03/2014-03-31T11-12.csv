The checkbox is not the right choice for allowing customers to make the decision.<p>I can suggest couple solutions:\nOption 1. Explicitly state during the signup process that for recoverability purposes all customer data is removed in N hours after request. At this point DO may loose some customers, which have wrong expectations from the service, but the interface will be simpler.<p>Option 2. Replace checkbox with additional confirmation page, that asks customer about data removal strategy (&quot;thrash can&quot; or &quot;scrub&quot;). There should not be default selection here.\nAdditional safety measures can be implemented to avoid occasional selection of &quot;scrub&quot; - confirmation by e-mail,  using SMS security code or some other &quot;two-factor&quot; approval.",1396267151

You&#x27;ll communicate with a game server using JSON over TCP. More details will be delivered later.”<p>I don&#x27;t understand how this could work for a real-time game. I don&#x27;t know what the input format is like but assuming you need to provide control commands eg:<p><pre><code>    {accelerate:1.0, steer:-0.01, brake:0}\n</code></pre>\nThen the behaviour of my car depends wholly on when that command arrives at the server. If there is a small delay it could have a dramatic effect on the position of the car. Similarly, my AI needs to react to information sent by the server which similarly could be delayed when sending over TCP.<p>Assuming the input format is the actual status of the car, eg:<p><pre><code>    {positionx:123, positiony:234}\n</code></pre>\nThen what is to stop me from submitting illegal inputs? Validation might work but it will be impossible for me to validate the output of my AI without access to the simulation code (apparently that is being kept closed source).<p>Maybe there is another technical solution I haven&#x27;t thought of?

Stack your DVDs and magazines carefully, folks.<p>More substantively: When divided into &quot;pro-impact&quot; and &quot;no-impact&quot; groups for the &quot;improvised debate&quot; mentioned in the article, the former camp is described as having essentially parroted all the various arguments their elders make for pornography being bad for teenagers, while the latter camp had no such arguments for the position they were assigned to defend. Segal is (somewhat) careful to avoid explicitly drawing any inferences from that, but the obvious implication is that the &quot;pro-impact&quot; camp is correct (&quot;Given that pornography is emotionally charged, it would be shocking if it had no impact.&quot;) Leaving aside the question of what a small cohort of randomly selected 16-to-18-year-olds, an age not generally noted for its keen introspective abilities, can be expected to know about much of anything, I&#x27;d be curious to find out whether the cohort which produced this result had had anything like equal exposure to both sides of the debate, or whether instead the &quot;pro-impact&quot; kids drubbed the &quot;no-impact&quot; ones because only the former had been fed lines beforehand.",1396267109

7500816,comment,7499932,7500309,1,0,jdietrich,,,"Recent F1 championships have been extremely competitive, with several teams in the running for the title. Red Bull have been dominant, but that&#x27;s not solely down to budget - they have for several years run an almost perfect campaign, down to the last detail. The best driver can&#x27;t win the world championship without the best team director and the best technical director. Red Bull&#x27;s success owes as much to Adrian Newey and Christian Horner as it does to Sebastian Vettel. Brawn GP won the 2009 championships without a title sponsor, largely due to the inspired work of Ross Brawn in developing the double diffuser concept.<p>The F1 rulebook is a complex political compromise that needs to satisfy several parties with competing interests. Bernie wants the most profitable show, the FIA want a sport that best reflects the pinnacle of motorsport and the teams want whatever they think will serve to their advantage. That balance of power is fragile and constantly shifting. The Strategy Group and the Commission have agreed to a budget cap for 2015, which should put most of the grid on equal financial terms.<p>There is no simple answer to the management of Formula 1, nor any magic bullet to &#x27;fix&#x27; the perceived failings of the sport. For every fan that just wants to see a fair fight between the drivers, there is another who wants to see a pure technical competition. For every fan who wants more overtaking and a better show, there is another that hates the contrivances of DRS, tiny rear wings and the dreaded Pirelli tyres. F1 is a sport that reflects all of the complexities and tensions of finance and politics, for better and for worse. It is the biggest, brashest, richest, maddest show on earth, for better and for worse. Try too hard to constrain those forces and you end up with something like A1GP - a sport that in theory panders to the fans, but in doing so loses the magic that makes people care about this gloriously absurd waste of resources that we call motorsport.",1396266806

In science, models are not &quot;thrown away&quot; because there is no need to throw them away.  Multiple models can exist side-by-side, whereas it seems to me that this is not the case in software.<p>For example, Newtonian mechanics were great for a really long time.  Then relativity came along and was found to be superior to Newtonian mechanics in some situations.  Does that mean that we threw out Newtonian mechanics?  No!  It&#x27;s still a useful model, regardless of the fact that it&#x27;s wrong in some cases.<p>The point I&#x27;m making is that biology uses &quot;single inheritance&quot; not because it&#x27;s right, but because it&#x27;s useful in some cases.

They use pattern recognition software to detect a large, price-insensitive seller or buyer and bid up (or down) accordingly.&quot;<p>A) On every exchange that I know of, the only way that using tiny orders gives you any information advantage is that on certain exchanges fill information is processed faster than market updates. Nothing in that fill information would allow you to determine if there is a large price insensitive market participant in the market vs lots of small price sensitive participants.<p>B) Nearly every exchange out there allows large participants a variety of mechanisms to hide their order flow.  The simplest is iceberg orders.<p>C) It is a feature, not a bug that prices change in the face of large order flow.  Every market in the world, electronic or otherwise works on this basic assumption.<p>Finally, your example about spamming quotes to create congestion on matching engines is a problem that has already been resolved.

The point is these types of analyses, because of their nature, tend to require additional care regarding external validity, because:<p>a) many make the mistake to think that big n means you don&#x27;t need to worry about sampling biases, ie. what Harford was referring to as the &quot;N = all&quot; fallacy and what I believe was his main point; you&#x27;ll agree it tends to be more common in &quot;big n&quot; analyses<p>b) since data collection is not an issue, the real challenge is in data <i>cleaning</i>, which requires special care because you need to think about potential biases in the way the data was generated (a process you had no control about); this can be trickier than it sounds when exploring large datasets that were passively generated, because <i>every</i> feature is potentially subject to these biases and some are less than obvious. The Boston case was a good example, but now consider that in many real-world datasets almost all features are subject to similar considerations (and may all be subject to different biases)<p>c) the focus on predictive power when using theory-free metrics leads to a risk of overfitting when the possible sources of heterogeneity are not understood (ie. the assumptions are not made explicit)<p>d) since they&#x27;ve been optimized for predictive power, they give a false sense of security (&quot;it worked on the validation set!&quot;); this is compounded by the fact these models will often work for a while (as is the case in GFT) before breaking down [1]<p>e) since there is a stronger focus on exploratory analysis, addressing the multiple comparisons problems is not as trivial as you make it sound; the issue is not the statistical tools we have at our disposal [2] but making all your assumptions explicit, which is trickier in the exploratory phase (because by doing this initial phase, you are already implicitly dismissing or selecting relationships to study)<p>f) since these analyses tend to be very application-oriented and to function at a large scale, mistakes have the potential to be much more destructive (for example, false positives in the Target example). This is compounded by the fact that due to the technical challenges in handling complicated data, and because applications are often found in tech companies, many people who do these analyses come from a computer science background and are not necessarily well trained in statistics or econometrics<p>Again, none of these are insurmountable; no one is actually dismissing Big Data analyses as a whole, but they present some unique opportunities for screwing up.<p>[1] Incidentally, this is precisely why I said earlier that discussing the details of GFT seemed only tangential to the point: yes, the Google researchers were well aware of the limitations of the method, and so is Harford (&quot;Google Flu Trends will bounce back, recalibrated with fresh data – and rightly so&quot;). The relevant point is <i>not</i> whether the Google researchers were right, but the false sense of certainty it instills for the consumers of the research, something I also made explicit at the end of my last post.<p>[2] Although some make a pretty good case that it is, but this is beyond the scope of this comment:\n<a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-errors-1.14700"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-statistical-err...</a><p>Edit: I forgot to address the first part of your reply. While of course the researchers knew that people looked for these terms because they are concerned by their health, what is missing is why these <i>specific</i> queries are important: you may well find that some of these queries are more related to general concern, while some are specifically about treatment options, and others about vaccination. These may not evolve at the same time and in the same direction, and while they may have been indistinguishable in the past, it&#x27;s entirely possible the first type of queries will be disproportionately affected by changes in the Google algorithm vs. others, or that some of the assumptions are only valid for one type of query and not the others. In economics (which is Harford&#x27;s background), this is often considered insufficient when deciding whether to add a variable to a model.",1396263617
