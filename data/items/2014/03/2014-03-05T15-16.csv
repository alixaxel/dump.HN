7347657,comment,7346454,7346454,2,0,ChristianMarks,,,"Fair enough. I tried in my youth to solve every problem I came across. There were many I couldn&#x27;t solve. It took a while before I developed the wisdom and discipline not to solve every problem no matter how long it took. By a while I mean decades. I sacrificed the possibility of family life, have stopped talking to my uncomprehending stepfather, and have kept my social interactions to an absolute minimum to pursue my consuming interest. (I mention this as a point of pride.) I find myself continually astonished by the ingenuity of solutions I probably could never have imagined after years of work. Perhaps, after a lifetime of effort that must be continually maintained, I have attained the level an entering freshman at Harvard. At this stage, I may be reduced at best to connoisseurship of some aspects of mathematics.<p>Now for some reflections on attitudes. Mathematicians sometimes act as if they believe that expertise in mathematics transfers to expertise in mathematics education. Suppose you are a sensitive student, lacking in confidence. You open Korner&#x27;s beautiful book on Fourier Analysis, and the first thing you are greeted with is  &quot;This book is meant neither as a drill book for the successful student nor as a lifebelt for the unsuccessful student.&quot; Korner does not mention other references suitable for the successful and the unsuccessful student. You take this comment to mean that Korner would let the unsuccessful student drown. There is no implication, but this is the psychological import, the implicature. Why mention the unsuccessful student at all?  Why not say who the book is for, without planting this gratuitous image in the reader&#x27;s mind? It would take some time to return to this book, to get past the wonder at a mind capable of such an incidental, dismissive, off-handed acknowledgement of &quot;the unsuccessful student.&quot;<p>You could say this is &quot;overthinking.&quot; Such remarks, microagressions as they are termed today, &quot;perpetrated against those due to gender, sexual orientation, and <i>ability status</i>&quot;, are sometimes revealed in the asides of mathematical authors [1].<p>And now if only mathematics educators would evaluate their students on the state of their confusion!<p>[1]  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression</a>",1394035022

Maybe you fell in the mediatic trap of considering that discussion about Redis turning into a CP system using the proposed algorithm. If you re-read the post, Aphyr itself explains that this is not Redis Cluster.<p>If you are curious about what triggered the post, is my claim that WAIT per se as a primitive does not mean CP or any other kind of consistency, but that it is defined by the rest of the system. To prove my point, I orchestrated a toy and god-driven distributed system where WAIT turned into a strong consistent primitive. The point is that you can replace the &quot;God&quot; part with other stuff to get it real-world.<p>Apyhr modeled it and found that if you don&#x27;t read the same way you write (via agreement) the system is inconsistent when you consider reads, but I think this was common knowledge. Every CP system in the base case needs to follow the same path for writes and reads. However most of the times you can invent optimizations to speedup reads.<p>p.s. Redis replication is asynchronous by default. The WAIT primitive in Redis unstable does just what it claims, that is, to return an acknowledgment when the specified number of replicas received some data.

The designer built a layout tool to streamline setting up those islands, and at some point he realized he was having more fun building attractive layouts than actually playing the game.

Nobody needs to learn how to graph accurate ellipses and the various facts about congruent triangles before doing calculus. You also don&#x27;t need excellence in algebra to do geometry. There are some fundamentals, like being able to work with fractions, but largely high school education is a lot of parallel topics that they make you think are linearly dependent (no linear algebra pun intended).<p>Advanced math, on the other hand, is a different matter. And as far as HS education is concerned I believe the focus should be on building mathematical thinking skills and not worrying about preparing students for a particular subject they&#x27;re unlikely to ever use.<p>For example, here is a lecture that I give to HS math students on graph theory [1]. You&#x27;ll notice there&#x27;s no algebra, no geometry, no calculus, almost nothing is required except the idea of a function (and even that is technically not required, and I tell them not to worry if it&#x27;s confusing). What is in this talk is a whole lot of mathematical thinking, and I do believe (though this sounds like bravado) that if I were to put my mind to it I could model a year&#x27;s worth of HS education around developing this kind of mathematical thinking. It would also have some highly nonlinear components to it, organized instead primarily around proof techniques.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jeremykun.com/2011/06/26/teaching-mathematics-graph-theory/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeremykun.com/2011/06/26/teaching-mathematics-graph-t...</a>",1394034284

It contains the address of the raster-interrupt. Almost everything in most C64 games hangs off the raster interrupt. That + 6502 assembly + a book explaining the C64 registers is all you need to get a good start at reverse engineering the workings of 90%+ of C64 games, and most of them will consists of at most a few thousand lines of code (The rest includes various oddities - e.g. Sid Meier&#x27;s Pirates for C64 consisted of high level logic written in BASIC plus a bunch of asm subroutines to speed things up and/or save space).",1394033175

I recognize your name from the Scalding code, so I&#x27;ll say that this is meant as helpful criticism and not a complaint.*<p>- There a couple types for datasets in the Scalding API: TypedPipe, and KeyedList and subclasses. Scoobi subsumes both of these under DList; thanks to the usual Scala wizardry, this has all the methods to operate on key-value pairs without loss of typesafety. This isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but it removes the tiny pains of constantly converting back and forth between the two.\n- Scoobi&#x27;s <i>other</i> abstraction, DObject, represents a single value. These are usually created by aggregations or as a way to expose the distributed cache, and have all the operations you&#x27;d expect when joining them together or with full datasets. You can emulate this in Cascading / Scalding, but it&#x27;s a bit less explicit and more error-prone.\n- There&#x27;s no equivalent to the compile-time check for serialization in Scalding, AFAICT.\n- Scoobi has less opinions about the job runner itself... there are some helpers for setting up the job, but all features are available as a library. For some reason, I found the two harder to separate in Scalding?\n- IIRC, Scalding did job setup by mutating a Cascading object that was available implicitly in the Job. In Scoobi, you build up an immutable datastructure describing the computation and hand that to the compiler. This suits my sense of aesthetics better, I suppose...<p>* Also, thanks to you guys for Algebird! That&#x27;s a really fantastic little project, and I use it all the time.",1394032807

You probably underestimate how difficult a job this is.<p>With that in mind, this is already quite a long list of diverse topics. You neglected to mention an introduction to number, up to the real numbers, perhaps because you now think it is obvious. You were taught that.<p>I personally try to teach &#x27;looking forward&#x27;: explaining how these concepts link towards what direction you might take in the future.<p>However, it&#x27;s very difficult to cover the whole scope of mathematics and mathematical subjects. For example, I personally knew only a little about what&#x27;s relevant to EE (although I&#x27;ve learned over time). But, it&#x27;s not that you could skip anything from the school curriculum anyway - my general advice is that potential EE students need to show interest enough to study independently outside of school.<p>Something like algorithmic complexity, you <i>should</i> be learning from Knuth.

By that I mean that it&#x27;s very hard for me to understand what a lot of symbols mean because mathematicians (and physicians) love to use single letters to name various concepts and functions.<p>Worse, they also like to use the same symbol to denote different things in different fields. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s extremely convenient to have a shorthand when working and sharing &quot;code&quot; with some peers in the know but for stuff like wikipedia articles it makes things appear more complex and obscure than they should.<p>I don&#x27;t mind if people call a local function variable &quot;n&quot; in some code, it&#x27;s usually non ambiguous. But if you export a variable &quot;n&quot; in an external API you will be screamed at. Why is it ok for maths?<p>To give a quick example, the letter <i>R</i> in maths can mean the set of real numbers. It can also (with a different typeface!) mean Ramanujan summation. Oh wait, you&#x27;re doing physics? Then <i>R</i> is the gas constant, silly.<p>Also, <i>i</i> is the imaginary unit.

Sure, if price swings wildly, there will be a large volume associated with it, but if there&#x27;s a large spike in volume it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean a big change in price.<p>So ultimately volume is a measure of interest, but for every bought share there was a sold share, so it&#x27;s not a measure of performance. I would bet that higher volumes might mean lower bid/ask spreads, meaning you&#x27;re paying a smaller penalty to get in/out of a position, but for most retail traders that spread isn&#x27;t going to make or break you anyway.",1394032613

The mechanics to make you pay absolutely feel contrived and scummy; the game strongly limits how much you can play in a given time period (stamina), and playing more than that requires the equivalent of $1. Dungeons also have strange difficulty levels, where the boss is <i>significantly</i> more challenging than the levels leading to it, so after you&#x27;ve invested the time to get there, you have the choice of &quot;paying&quot; $1 each time you are about to lose, or leaving the dungeon and potentially having to &quot;pay&quot; $1 to play more -- especially since the harder dungeons eat up a larger portion of your stamina. The worst, though, is that obtaining better monsters requires a slot-machine style gamble, and each try costs around $5. There&#x27;s such a high chance of getting a mediocre monster instead, that there&#x27;s actually a term called &quot;Gung-trolled.&quot;<p>That said, the game is very well designed and a lot of fun, and lends itself well to being played during a short commute. There are a subset of players who make a lot of progress without any in-app purchases, but the game constantly makes you question what&#x27;s worth more: your time, or $1.<p>Personally, I would be happier with a $5-10/mo subscription fee, but instead I&#x27;m left with a twinge of guilt every time I make an in-app purchase.",1394031697

I had a team of heavy front-end (html/css/Jquery) developers get up to speed in knockout fairly easily.  It would have been a nightmare explaining to them how to make Angular directives and some of the more complex services stuff.<p>BTW, I think Knockout is just prescriptive enough to get a pretty tight maintainable codebase, but without causing another layer of wrapping/complexity when you want to use existing JQuery components.",1394031616

Having worked in the UK Civil Service, sounds to me the person making this decision didn&#x27;t know what it meant and that it was an actual security issue. Probably they thought it was sort of idly interesting, like speculating how many office computers are still beige.
