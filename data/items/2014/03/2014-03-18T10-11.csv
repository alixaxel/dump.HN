7421199,comment,7419205,7420961,1,0,Xylakant,,,"If you want to validate a bearer token, multiple backends in different datacenters need to share a datastore that replicates at least somewhat fast. If you use HMAC-Signed URLS you just need to replicate the API keys that you use to calculate the token and the required guarantees are lower than for a bearer token. In principle, the method is sound - AWS uses a similar approach for signed URLs that allow access to S3 resources.",1395140347

The result cut down the number of stat calls from 100k+ on startup to <20k without any other changes, and cut tens of seconds of the startup time....<p>The stuff I did is a giant hack, but frankly Bundler needs serious work there - for almost all Ruby code I&#x27;ve worked on, poor load path handling in Rubygems and Bundler accounts for 90%+ of startup time.",1395140324

Most teams I know of prefer to write their code using the native toolkits. For them, writing in C# would be an extra cost. Few see writing equivalent code in Objective-C and Java as prohibitive because it&#x27;s very common to host the bulk of the functionality on servers and only run UI code on the mobile client. UI code has traditionally been non-portable.<p>For those who are already writing their mobile apps in C# for whatever reason, porting to Windows Phone is already easier than porting from Objective-C or Java.",1395140278

The tools deliver what they promise, in my opinion. Built application look and feel like full native apps.<p>I don&#x27;t want to repeat the comments made by others, but one other other thing that impressed me was being able to compile c# code into a portable class library dll on windows, then just copy the binary to a macbook and link it into my iOS app project. Very cool code reuse.<p>Not knowing ObjC made getting started on iOS harder than it could have been because examples tend to be in ObjC - although Xamarin have some useful snippets and recipes on their site. Android was easy because of the similarity between Java and C#.

Things then started to change: Netflix, Spotify, BBC iPlayer, etc etc. The legit services are - with three exceptions - now in most cases better and easier and smoother than the piracy alternative. But the three exceptions can be fairly major:<p>1. Price (well, duh). Netflix is cheap imo, Spotify is cheap, but piracy is still free.<p>2. Spread of content. Less an issue with Spotify which has just about EVERYTHING but more so with video services. Piracy has any movie, any TV show.

HBO Go is only available in a few countries. BBC iPlayer only in the UK.

Other times I write nasty hacks, because it is required quickly, and they just need something that works. Depends on time constraints and other factors. This interview technique obviously assumes that time is plentiful, and refactoring is the most important thing about the code. Usually it is not (at least for most of the places I have worked over the last ten years).<p>I personally find I get a good idea about someones ability by <i>talking</i> to them. I have a good idea about my colleagues ability, despite not having read much of their code. If they seem s to have a passion for programming, understand a variety of concepts, know what libraries are useful for what tasks, then I will have an idea that they are good.<p>Or are they still logging onto MySQL from the command line, because anything else is too complex to set up. Print statements for debugging, because an IDE is to complex to set up with graphical debugging.

The reality is, it&#x27;s not my skin color, my sex or my sexual orientation that made me a hacker, but years of hard work in my teens and pure perseverance in the face of insults, mocking and being &quot;the unpopular geek&quot;. I&#x27;ve most definitely been much less privileged during my teen years than most girls (can&#x27;t say about non-whites or gays, because there weren&#x27;t any (yet)). It only now, after we&#x27;ve struck gold and the &quot;outsiders&quot; want to get in to get a piece of the pie, that we&#x27;re being acknowledged, envied and called privileged.

Just deselecting the wrong button (for example disconnecting a generator and a cross tie connector), will put you in manual control, with all the cockpit lights and half the instruments off, several alarms ringing... not a desirable situation even for an experienced pilot. You are able to forget to communicate, to navigate, you are able to crash to a mountain because you are looking at a flashing light, I can´t find a good example outside of aviation to make you understand the feeling to look at a panel and not knowing what the hell is going on.<p>At simulators we practice all the normal emergencies, that will cover you 99,5 of the times. Most emergencies are simple, but some times something that is not known even to Boeing happens. Or it´s a simple emergency but you take the wrong steps. This happens more frequently to pilots who passed a lacking instruction method (like the one I describe that´s happening at china), but can happen to anyone.<p>The Air France crash was due to a no emergency situation (they just needed to keep altitude, and engine thrust selection to keep a normal flight and recover the instruments) that was converted in to a crash due to a misinterpretation and wrong piloting skills.",1395137160

The only one consistent with the known data is an inside-job hijacking with an intentional cabin depressurization to incapacitate the passengers and non-pilot crew.<p>The fact that the plane has not been found is very strong evidence that it did not crash.  If it crashed on water, some debris would most likely have been found by now.  If it had crashed on land, someone would have noticed the resulting fire.<p>The in-flight fire theory is not plausible because the 777 is fly-by-wire.  A fire severe enough to knock out the comms would almost certainly have taken out the fly-by-wire system as well.<p>And no, cell phones don&#x27;t work at 30k over water, but they do work at 10k over land.
