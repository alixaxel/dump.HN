The first time about 14-15 years ago when the JVM was pretty doggish. I <i>think</i> it was Java 1.4 or 1.5. I don&#x27;t think Eclipse was even out then, and the first version I remember seeing was so dog slow at the time compared to Visual C++ that I remember just writing off Java entirely.<p>To my surprise it stuck around in Enterprise spaces and I ended up running a team that ported a pretty large-ish Perl project (about 20k lines of Perl) into a piece of Java middleware. I didn&#x27;t do any of the coding, but I knew the Perl bits inside and out so I knew what kind of testing and performance to expect and getting the Java port <i>up to</i> 1/3rd to 1/2 the performance of the original Perl was a pretty big challenge at the time. This was about...8 year ago. But to the credit of the team and I guess the tooling, they were able to get the port done remarkably quick.<p>So I&#x27;ve been pretty surprised to see that Java code <i>can</i> get fast, really fast. I&#x27;ve also managed to bang out some pretty slow code if I wasn&#x27;t paying attention. For my latest touch into it, I ended up spending a week just benchmarking various collections to see how they actually worked under the kind of real-world uses I&#x27;d be putting them through (vs. what their big-O sheets claimed) and came away with a set of practices for me to get going with.<p>I&#x27;ve also had to come to terms with benching code a bunch of times to give the JIT compiler or whatever runs under the hood in the JVM some time to optimize, the first few runs are invariably much slower than run 1000.",1395192921

Indeed, the level of rhetoric in our burgeoning class warfare is escalating rapidly; &quot;technocrats&quot; is my new favorite label.<p>But I question the TNCs strategy of approaching this long-term. It appears the strategy was simply to try and go the popular-opinion route. Of course the market has spoken, and it prefers Uber & Lyft by a huge margin over the traditional taxi market. However, in dealing with regulatory matters, political dealings are a necessary cost of doing business.<p>Instead, the TNCs did a few things wrong: 1) they jumped into the process a bit too late, 2) they took an antagonistic, condescending tone with the powers-that-be, and 2) they under-estimated the power of old-fashioned lobbying by the taxi industry.<p>Principles of market openness, disgust with the political climate, etc. don&#x27;t really matter in light of moving ahead. Now, the Seattle market is likely stalled for a lengthy amount of time. And, future markets know they&#x27;ll be able to extract a pound of flesh as the TNCs look to expand.<p>I hate the outcome and think the City Council deserves to be revoked, but the TNCs needed to do a much better job in handling this situation.",1395192886

7426207,comment,7425303,7425858,1,0,gfodor,,,"This sounds somewhat wrong. Ray tracing is just another term for path tracing, as paths are made up of traced rays. A naive camera-to-light witting ray tracer is still a sampling path tracer but has bias towards a specific subset of paths, namely those which follow specular bounces from the eye to the light or those which have one diffuse bounce.<p>Much of the progress in photorealistic rendering has come from improving the techniques used to sample paths. Bi-directional path tracing samples paths by tracing paths from both the light and the eye and performing a technique called multi-importance sampling in order to weight them appropriately. This allows the algorithm to pick up more light paths that would otherwise be hard to reach, such as those which form caustic reflections.<p>One of the more recent developments on this front is the use of the &quot;specular manifold&quot;, which allows a path sampler to &quot;walk&quot; in path-space that allows capturing of even more partially-specular paths. (See Wenzel 2013.) This technique allows efficient sampling of the main light transport paths in scenes where a specular transparent surface surrounds a light source, ex a light bulb casing.<p>Edit: for this specific hardware, it sounds like they are using a hybrid approach so may very well be doing a basic eye-to-light ray tracing algorithm and then using raster for diffuse surface shading.",1395191335

But, to me, the beauty of this technique goes beyond the effects you can achieve: it&#x27;s an incredibly compact, uniform way of simulating light. Compared to rasterization, which to get the same result, you need a enormous code base that deals with very effect with caution. Adding a reflection in a rasterized scene might not reflect your shadows, etc. You need care about every possible interaction between every effect.",1395190801
