7451078,comment,7449728,7449728,5,0,incision,,,"I wouldn&#x27;t call myself a developer, more of a generalist.<p>I started my first real job in technology in the mid-late 90s and spent roughly the first half of my career maintaining systems that were built by other people.<p>Eventually, I jumped up a level and stared accelerating from there. Planning, writing proposals and doing the technical implementation for projects of increasing size and complexity. With each major undertaking done I was looking for the next as I had no interest in getting drawn back into maintenance mode.<p>I started toying with the idea of working for myself, being a truly independent consultant and ended up doing some side projects while maintaining a full time job. The money was great, nearly double my full-time job hourly rate, but it wasn&#x27;t nearly consistent enough and I was in the process of starting a family.<p>With all the responsibilities of a family looming I had more or less mentally resigned myself to moving into a rock-steady management role and calling it a career.<p>That plan didn&#x27;t work out for what at the time were incredibly frustrating reasons, but it turned out for the best. I took a job as an independent contractor for a lot more money doing a mix of interesting projects and braindead operations.<p>That&#x27;s where I am today, I&#x27;ve realized that I&#x27;m unlikely to ever be satisfied working for other people or working on the same things for more than perhaps year at a time.<p>At the same time, I&#x27;ve realized that I don&#x27;t need to draw satisfaction from my day job. By coming to grips with being parent and learning to manage my time and goals I&#x27;m able to collect a good, steady income to live while doing a full load of courses and dabbling in side projects to satisfy myself.<p>That&#x27;s probably the most important part. <i>Once I was earning enough money to have everything my family needs plus many of the things we want I found myself wanting less and realized at least within the same order of magnitude more money isn&#x27;t what I want.</i><p>As best I can tell, what I want is autonomy and variety.<p>Figuring out what it is that you actually want would a great start.<p>Personally, I mean to continue my education while building up enough consistency on the side to transition that to be primary income. If something better comes along in the meantime - great.",1395525398

Further, it&#x27;s likely poor people will have better access to top notch lawyers if the lawyer can expect to recoup their cost from the state (rather than just not being paid by the poor person).",1395525392

I think the family in question was living out of an RV and traveling around regularly. Maybe they were retired. I did not really know. They had me send the check to the nearest post office.

This created real problems. It was still necessary to preserve old information and old methods of doing things.

Our first customer was willing to be an early adopter and was sold on the vision of what we could build for them. We couldn&#x27;t have mastered the problem domain without having real users and data.<p>It&#x27;s actually a good deal for both sides: the customer gets high-touch, custom-tailored software for relatively little money (because you&#x27;re funding the development and you own the software). You get a proving ground and data. As long as you&#x27;ve identified a problem shared by other customers that you&#x27;ll be able to sell again and again, it can be a big win.<p>It also helps that we&#x27;ve been out selling (at least regionally) for three years now. It adds to our legitimacy. People in the industry are getting to know us, and that has made them more willing to say yes.<p>And B2B sales cycles can be absurdly long.

So, when I ended up in US through graduate school, I have thought I made it. But, again, I was pretty clue less after the school was complete. I have thought I should follow money (even though I was passionate about AI and did my graduate school in it) and joined e-commerce consulting firm in 2000. got laid off twice and ended up for a small company where I thought I was doing AI stuff. Slacked off for 9 years.. ended up making about 100K when I quit (worked myself through management: engineer -> Director of engineering). then, I have joined a development manager at a public company and has been working there for 3 1/2 for about 150K salary (40K stock every year). I thought I will be doing searching and machine learning. But, I have gotten deceived again(my team was cut in half)I have tried making side projects.. picked complex ones like image searching. but, couldn&#x27;t sell it. I have thought may be I should something my own (I am 37 now.. leaving in a rural US town with 2 kids). So, I have resigned my job (from largest enterprise software company in world) and trying out entrepreneurship.. want to build great AI application.

In an end-to-end security model, then as you suggest - your browser should be involved, and I&#x27;d say that your browser should be performing the validation - it would need to have a recursive nameserver built in.<p>But that&#x27;s not the DNSSEC model. The DNSSEC model is to implicitly trust your resolver, which is usually hosted remotely, accessed via an unauthenticated channel, and to ask it to perform the validation for you. If the validation fails, all your browser gets is &quot;SERVFAIL&quot; :<p><pre><code>    dig +qr +dnssec dnssec-failed.org @8.8.8.8\n\n    ; <<>> DiG 9.8.3-P1 <<>> +qr +dnssec dnssec-failed.org @8.8.8.8\n    ;; global options: +cmd\n    ;; Sending:\n    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 6944\n    ;; flags: rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1\n\n    ;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:\n    ; EDNS: version: 0, flags: do; udp: 4096\n    ;; QUESTION SECTION:\n    ;dnssec-failed.org.\t\tIN\tA\n\n    ;; Got answer:\n    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: SERVFAIL, id: 6944\n    ;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 0, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1\n\n</code></pre>\nSo it doesn&#x27;t have the capacity to report a meaningful error.<p>Solving the wifi-lying problem is tricky too. A wifi network could always falsely-claim that the root zone is not signed, or fake the keys, and take things from there. Unless you keep all resolution on your laptop/tablet/phone, and synchronize the root public keys periodically (a problem equivalent to getting up-to-date root CA certs) - there&#x27;s nothing to build trust on. Even more simply; the wifi network can just block DNS and disable dnssec resolution on its own resolver.",1395522743
