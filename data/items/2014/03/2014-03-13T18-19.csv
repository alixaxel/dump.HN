So what I find most interesting there is that the odds continued to rise for PSG after the goal, even though people (like me) put money on when they went behind -better odds, and cheers for the £20.  The crucial thing that&#x27;s at issue with this system is that it&#x27;s not just the weight of money that&#x27;s at work here, but also the bookies adjusting the odds to ensure their book is still green, and to encourage/discourAge people putting further weight on particular outcomes.<p>Tl;dr - the method is really interesting, but imperfect because it&#x27;s not a pure market, I think.  Bet fair odds or similar would be interesting, but their API is horrendous.",1394737175

Which is basically if you took a bus that was going to a common aggregation node (like Caltrain) and let people summon it (like Uber) you could then present them with an estimate when the bus would show up (like NextBus) and how long the trip would take to your destination. Then in the morning as everyone summoned &quot;I want to get to Caltrain&quot; you layout the route and start driving.

But comparing it to the existing system while having a blind faith in it is  wrong. In our existing system patients don&#x27;t have many options of checking what their doctor tells them; they are referred to doctors by other doctors and very often have no way of checking on the reputation (% of successful operations this doctor conducted, for instance).

It&#x27;s not even an original gimmick. The whole &quot;integrate Bitcoin into everything&quot; appears to be motivated by more of a cargo cult to appear modern and countercultural than anything rational.<p>However, it does offer an alternative payment system and in this case it works, so I won&#x27;t complain about that.<p>But can we please let go of these childish fantasies that Bitcoin will overthrow all government and usher us into an anarchist utopia of voluntaryism and global human liberation?

You see, the thing is that even if the concept of Bitcoin theoretically can allow financial independence from the state, it&#x27;s completely meaningless when your ecosystem is a mess. The Bitcoin ecosystem, as we have witnessed so many times, is absolute chaotic mayhem that can ironically only be controlled through state regulation, which many hardcore Bitcoiners are advocating for.<p>Homeschooling is opting out of the state?

The difference is that when they do slip deadlines, it tends to be a whole lot more surprising (and therefore damaging to the schedules of other teams) because their feedback mechanisms tend to result in poorer-quality progress tracking.<p>Every project management methodology has these problems, because at some level these problems are political.  No methodology is going to overcome that, though some are better than others at dealing with it.

7393866,comment,7392320,7392677,10,0,TaylorAlexander,,,"I&#x27;ve thought about this recently, and the solution is the Oculus Rift or some incarnation of VR. Mounting the monitors is really the only major technical challenge to the setup you describe, and not being able to adjust your distance to mounted monitors would also be a real problem. The current Rift dev kit does not have sufficient resolution to do computer work, and the new units still will not have nearly the pixel density of modern monitors, but what you lose in pixel density you gain in screen real estate.<p>The rift basically surrounds you in a digital environment, and a few people have already started to show off desktop environments that work in VR. Working at your computer in VR means a few major benefits:<p>-Your workstation is no longer defined by the physical space it resides in, so it can go with you wherever you want, such as on the train, in your self-driving car, etc.<p>-Your workspace is no longer limited to several constrained rectangles in front of you - you pay for a single display device and get a workspace that literally surrounds you.<p>-You are no longer required to sit upright staring forward, something we have generally acknowledged isn&#x27;t good for you. Some people spend more money on a nice chair than the cost of an Oculus Rift just to save their back. Not needing to stare forward to view monitors means you can work in any orientation, such as a comfortable reclined position. The staple of starship captains and movie hackers, the reclined &quot;dentist&quot; style chair is generally represented in movies as the way people would sit if they had sufficient resources, such as their own hollywood set building team.<p>-Your workspace is 3D, but not gimmick 3D monitor style - actual immersive 3D, so your applications could take advantage of this for more contextual information and improved workflow.<p>-You have total privacy - no one can see what you are working on in VR, so no one can look over your shoulder. That is until they make virtual coworking spaces. Which will happen.<p>-Your workspace can be flying through the cosmos, on a beach in Aruba, on a NASCAR track, or anywhere else you find interesting. You could be immersed in front row seats of a live tennis match while you work on your TPS reports. You could work on new VR applications inside of your new VR applications, for the ultimate inception &quot;yo dawg&quot; moment.<p>Cons:\nWe will become like the people in WALL<i>E.<p>But... will we? I work from home. I have a standard desktop and 3 monitors. I wake up, walk to the kitchen, make breakfast, then walk to the office to work. Google shopping Express delivers my groceries. Amazon delivers most of my other goods. If I had a self driving car I wouldn&#x27;t even need to participate in my own transportation when it was needed. What does this mean? It means the future is already on it&#x27;s way to becoming so convenient that a nearly 100% sedentary lifestyle is entirely possible even for first world people who maintain full employment. For people like me, a dentist chair and virtual reality workstation will not make me any more sedentary - I took 300 steps the other day. I can&#x27;t really hit much lower of a limit on that.<p>All this means is that I need to take control of my own exercise routine. I need to force myself to work out, as my daily life does not provide sufficient exercise as is. People who do not do this will become fat, like those in WALL</i>E. But being fat is clearly regarded as unhealthy, and our society is becoming aware of the dangers of unchecked obesity. As we get a handle on appropriate health care in the first world, we will need to encourage people to work out.<p>For now, I ride a bike, but if I had a self driving car that could take me to the gym while I worked on email, perhaps I&#x27;d get out and socialize more.<p>Rant/Aside:\nPeople are pretty dismissive of some of the amazing new tech coming out. Amazon wants to totally eliminate the cost of human labor for delivering goods by using drones, and people just say &quot;but yeah Skynet haha. It&#x27;s dumb anyway&quot;. Virtual reality is actually happening and it&#x27;s a revolutionary new kind of display device that I know will change the world, and people say &quot;but yeah the virtual boy sucked. this is just more hype, VR will never happen, or it doesn&#x27;t matter.&quot; Robotics in general can change the nature of how we consume things by eliminating all human costs. Robots have fixed costs that can be amortized down to nearly zero for incremental labor, something that is not possible for human workers. We should embrace the technology of the future and figure out how it can be used to do positive things, rather than dismiss it for it&#x27;s capability to do bad. Skynet jokes are old hat. Lets talk about how much better we can make the future.<p>Another note: Virtual reality and telepresence can eliminate the &quot;AI problem&quot; for robots - that is, we have been able to make robots that can do neat stuff for a long time, but giving them any intelligence has been a so far intractable problem. A remote human operator could control a robot worker with much more precision than our current AI technology, transporting human intelligence into a robot and eliminating the need for comprehensive AI. VR enables 1:1 viewing of remote 3D environments, something a monitor does not provide. This will lead to both good and bad new technology, but as they say - you take the good with the bad.",1394736001

The Nexus line is so that high-end influencers can show their friends how awesome their phone is, so that mainstream customers think &quot;I want an Android phone&quot; and not &quot;I want an iPhone&quot; and then can go buy from a wide variety of vendors if the Nexus itself doesn&#x27;t fit their price range.<p>It was pretty much the same story with Windows - as long as Apple was a viable competitor PC clones were pretty decent, but once Apple started going down the tubes you started getting bargain-basement Windows machines loaded up with crapware.

That doesn&#x27;t detract from her fluency.

It&#x27;s also been observed that children are more likely to sound native (in language 2) if they move to another country and learn that second language prior to puberty (see again, Nagle [2]).  So, gbog, if your child speaks/hears French, Chinese, and English regularly before hitting puberty, he/she will likely sound native in all three languages.

The desktop client consumes nearly 100% CPU while syncing. I realize that while scanning local folders, the client may need to run checksums on files (potentially CPU intensive), but Google Drive was consistently eating up extraordinary CPU resources even after scanning the local files.

Not waiting for traffic also makes them more reliable, especially during rush hour.  If you  can&#x27;t rely on the schedule, you have to put padding into your schedule, which makes them effectively even slower.  Trains are also faster because they have lots of doors and the passengers are waiting at the same level as the doors, and you&#x27;re not waiting for people to buy tickets, so the stops are quicker.  Since they move faster, you can also run a more frequent service with the same number of vehicles (driver cost is a very large component of operating costs of a public transit system)  They&#x27;re also smoother and so more pleasant to ride.

Many college students are appalled when they discover that the life isn&#x27;t as easy as they were led to believe.  I&#x27;m sure I was one of them; it&#x27;s been a while and my memory is foggy.  But complaining that things aren&#x27;t always hunky dory is silly.  At some point you have to make the best with what you have.  And saying &quot;but I don&#x27;t want to move away from my friends&quot; or &quot;but why do I have to pay market rates for a place to live?&quot; simply comes off as immature.",1394735062

Forcing them to either sell more than they intended, or abandon the house purchase, or restructure the purchase.<p>People with that experience might sell their assets, hold the money in their account until everything has settled, and <i>then</i> move forward.<p>Also folks who sell stock options often have big tax bills to pay.

Back in the day it was the only free service with real-time stock update. Google was proud to announce that and it was amazing. Today it still uses Flash, the stock screener is broken, portfolio&#x27;s can barely be rearranged.<p>What guarantee do we have here?

I need a strong, material answer from Google on this question long before a few dollar bills become the important matter of distinction.<p>~~~<p>I&#x27;m sorry if I come off as scaremongering. The point I&#x27;m trying to make is that most people who want their data backed-up well, for a long time, probably care less about the exact dollar amount and more about (perceived) longevity of the service.

There might be a few tech CEOs who work that long, but I am guessing for most of them it isn&#x27;t a sustainable workload.<p>I actually think the tips here are fine, but the premise that all successful people in silicon valley work ungodly amounts per week are inaccurate.  I know many very successful people who work 40-50 very efficient hours a week.<p>Also, one last comment...<p>> Demonstrate the 80/20 rule in everything you do. This means spending 80% of your time on the work that moves the needle, and only 20% on the smaller stuff.<p>Generally in this context, the 80/20 rule is used to mean that you get 80% of the benefit with 20% of the effort, it isn&#x27;t a rule about how to divide up your time.  IE in the time management context, it would mean you get 80% of the progress you create in 20% of your time spent working.  The key is figuring out what you are doing in that 20%.",1394733705
