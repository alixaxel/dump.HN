E.g. maybe it really is tautological or it&#x27;s testing legacy code that has been locked down forever. But if it does fail at some point in the future after having passed in dozens of iterations, that failure will convey a lot of information. Every time it passes, the information-theoretic value of that future failure increases. Unless running the test involves some onerous cost, there is no reason to delete it.

7355791,comment,7353868,7354369,6,0,phaker,,,"> <i>update packages and the kernel</i><p>PSA: If you just update the kernel using system tools within the instance, it&#x27;ll still boot the old one. (At least it did few months ago.)<p>The grub (or other bootloader) and kernels that are installed inside the instance&#x27;s disk image are silently ignored and the vm uses a kernel stored outside of your instance&#x27;s image. You can select which kernel image you want to boot in the control panel. The problem is that the kernels available in there are updated very, very rarely. For popular distributions like Ubuntu they can lag several months, for others it can get up to, say, _two years_ [1].<p>Since digitalocean &quot;doesn&#x27;t support custom kernels&quot; it appears that the only way to use something up to date (and stay secure) is to write a script that loads a custom kernel using kexec. :S<p>edit: The fact that they use kvm (and that kexec works) which means real visualization but can&#x27;t boot user&#x27;s kernels is just very, very weird. The only technical reason i can think of is that they can&#x27;t manage to make it work with their control panel. If that&#x27;s the reason, then it&#x27;s very worrying. (The &quot;right&quot; way is easier to code and it&#x27;s the solution that you&#x27;d think of first and it makes custom kernels a non-problem, but they picked one that both has obvious problems and is harder to setup, i can&#x27;t think of a reason why.)<p>[1]: <a href=""https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-can-i-boot-my-compiled-kernel-image-on-gentoo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/questions/how-can-i-b...</a>",1394132248

The fact that it is not actually insurance but a combination of tax and welfare program is true, but it&#x27;s hardly the fault of the person who has no choice in paying the tax. If you already are forced to pay the admission price, you may as well enjoy the benefit of what is being sold, even if you are forced to buy it and prefer not to.

That library should have its own tests.<p>Say I have three layers of custom code:  A calls B, which calls C.<p>If I want to test B, then I want to mock C, and have my test call B similar to how A does.  I want to mock C because C is also custom, and if my test fails, I want to know if it&#x27;s because of bad B implementation, and not because a buggy C might be confusing matters.<p>But if B also calls D from an external open source or vendor-supplied library, I don&#x27;t usually want to mock D.  That just adds needless complexity to the test, and reduces my focus on my own custom code.<p>An exception would be if this library code makes its own network call or something - then you might want to mock it to save time.<p>Anyway, mocked unit tests become far simpler if you maintain the right focus.  Use test A to call B (passing in canned fixtures if necessary), while B mocks C only to maintain focus on B&#x27;s implementation.  If you start getting involved in trying to mock external library code, or even internal private methods that B calls, you&#x27;ll have a bad time.<p>The advantage to maintaining that kind of focus is that refactoring becomes easier.  Want to change the name of C?  Your IDE should handle refactoring your test, too.  Want to change the implementation of B?  You don&#x27;t even need to change your test at all, just make sure the right values are still there in the return value.  Maybe you&#x27;d need to add a couple of assertions, but that&#x27;s it.  If you&#x27;re looking at having to do a serious refactoring of your unit test in those cases, then it probably just means you&#x27;re still designing your code architecture and things are still really fluid.  And in that case, it would make sense that you might have to throw away your test, because by definition it means you are still deciding on what your specifications are.",1394131058

Any time anybody sells any coins for cash or any other real goods, they owe tax on the difference between the sale price and the original purchase price.<p>There hasn&#x27;t been much formal on &quot;purchase price&quot; of mined coins as far as I know/remember. It&#x27;s probably safest to treat them as a purchase price of zero, thus if you sell mined coins for $100, then you have a $100 income that you owe tax on. A clever accountant might be able to claim that mining hardware, electricity, etc, is the cost of acquisition, and so offset the sale price in that way, but it probably isn&#x27;t worth the trouble for Satoshi or anyone else mining in the early days.",1394130654

What they have is extremely high quality typography and careful attention to how the text appears <i>on a specific page</i>. Book designers tweak prose to avoid rivers (a series of whitespace on successive lines that happen to line up with each other), widows (the final line of a paragraph appearing on its own at the beginning of a page), orphans (the first line of a paragraph appearing on its own at the beginning of a page, or when the last line of a paragraph contains only a single word), and hyphenation.<p>The web, which doesn&#x27;t have well-defined pages or even page sizes, precise control over typography, or designers who agonize over how the actual text appears in the context of the layout, lacks all of those. Typography is slowly getting better, but text layout algorithms are still relatively primitive.",1394129287
