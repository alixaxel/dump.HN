They are simply stating a consequence of the design of Turtl: it&#x27;s not possible (or not knowingly possible today) to understand if the end user is sharing copyrighted material.  I don&#x27;t feel that this is a point &quot;feature&quot; - it applies to any and all content by design and the intent is not therefore to provide a safe harbor of illegal material.<p>Some people are looking for data protection in the cloud (trading the risk for the convenience).  If companies like Turtl or SpiderOak didn&#x27;t exist myself, and many others, would be forced to rely on similar solutions that are self-hosted.  Is that intent?  I don&#x27;t think so.

Your 401k is a vehicle that allows you to &quot;borrow&quot; money from the government and earn interest on it (by being able to postpone taxes). Personally, I invest 100% of my 401k in an S&P 500 index. I have Fidelity, so my fund is Spartan 500 Investor Class (FUSVX). Use whatever S&P 500 index is available to you, though. If you still have money left, put it into a Roth IRA. Same deal: index fund. That covers  your long term goal.<p>Now, for the house. I&#x27;m not sure what to say here. Most of my personal savings is <i>also</i> in the Spartan 500. If you&#x27;ve got a sliding window of 5 years to buy a house, I&#x27;d recommend the same. Convert to something more stable (bonds?) when you&#x27;ve made some money... then hold on to it while you&#x27;re waiting to buy a house. However, consider buying one right now with little money down. Prices are stabilizing and interest rates are still historically low.<p>Finally, short term. You&#x27;re young, so you probably won&#x27;t listen (and honestly, that&#x27;s okay -- I&#x27;m not picking on you): don&#x27;t buy a 60k car. Spend 30k on a used Audi or BMW if that&#x27;s your thing. Personally, I would recommend spending 23k on a used Honda. You will be amazed (maybe) at what 23k gets you for a used Honda. Same deal as the house, though. Buy it now, with little money down. Interest rates are really low.<p>Good luck. Mid 20&#x27;s and already talking about saving half of your pay check. You&#x27;ll be fine. Just max that 401k. And please don&#x27;t get a 60k car :-)",1396270585

7501085,comment,7500691,7500938,5,0,rjknight,,,"These are becoming less true.  For #1, you might also choose CoffeeScript, ClojureScript or Dart.  For #2, you&#x27;ve always needed more than just HTML: CSS at least.  Now there&#x27;s Canvas and WebGL, and some frameworks like React are starting to abstract the DOM away somewhat.  Programming in ClojureScript with Om/React does not feel much like programming with HTML/JavaScript at all.<p>Beyond that, there&#x27;s an explosion of tooling.  Build tools, minifiers, preprocessors and compilers; systems for managing dependencies and run-time library loading; shims and polyfills to emulate new functionality on out-dated platforms; and, of course, frameworks which seek to abstract all of this stuff away behind a neat facade, providing a stable platform that you can build on without needing to worry about the details.  Nobody has figured out how to do this properly yet, and I&#x27;m not hugely optimistic about the future of such projects.<p>I&#x27;m not <i>quite</i> old enough to remember the history of GUI programming from the mid-80s to mid-90s, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if the proliferation of tools and libraries was similar then.  Even starting out doing Windows development in the mid-90s, there were multiple options - at least Visual Basic, Delphi or C++, and there were multiple C++ frameworks (MFC, ATL, varieties of COM-based stuff, and those were just Microsoft&#x27;s official options, and this completely ignores non-Windows platforms).<p>It would be interesting to do a retrospective on such technologies, to work out why some survived and others didn&#x27;t.  It would not have been at all obvious in 1995 that Objective-C would be a mainstream language for user interfaces nearly 20 years later, and C++ would have fallen away, and that people would still be using NextStep in the form of Cocoa but nobody would be using MFC.  My feeling is that there are some properties of good design which have enabled ObjC/Cocoa to survive for the long-term, and it would be interesting to figure out if any of the current crop of web front-end tools exhibit these properties (fwiw I get a good feeling about a lot of the ClojureScript stuff, especially Om).",1396270524

Ownership has deep roots in our culture.  Heck, even babies rapidly develop a sense of property (just try and take something from their hands).<p>On the other hand, few babies would complain if someone were to imitate them.  On the contrary, that&#x27;s a fundamental developmental need: the baby makes a sound, then her Mom barges in, imitates her, and we have the beginning of a communication.<p>Even on a purely technical basis, the world of ideas is nothing like the physical world: if I eat your banana, you can&#x27;t eat it any more.

I can use the idea, I can claim it was my idea to begin with, but I can&#x27;t erase the idea from your mind —which is a required component of stealing.  The only actual &quot;idea thief&quot; I know of is Gilderoy Lockhart from Harry potter.<p>The word &quot;property&quot;, as most people understand it, doesn&#x27;t apply to ideas.  &quot;Intellectual property&quot; is a type error.

In a more permissive environment, where hiding one&#x27;s stash was a simple matter of keeping it out of sight -- rather than, say, getting hold of a contraband razor blade and waiting until after lights-out to carefully slit a mattress seam where it didn&#x27;t show -- the question didn&#x27;t even arise, even for those of us not so fortunate as to have what was then the rare prize of unmonitored access to the Internet. Now?

The monarch issued a <i>writ patent</i>, that is a royal decree, and the monarch raised money at the expense of society.<p>In 1620 after an outburst of patenting to raise extra Parliamentary revenue by James I, Parliament passed the Statute of Monopolies which stated that only Parliament might grant monopolies in statutory form and that only for new inventions. The principle written into the law was that the only valid or legitimate use of the otherwise dangerous mechanism of the statutory monopoly was for new discoveries and that for a limited time.<p>That was then. Where we current live at is that this 400 year old legal concept of statutory monopolies is used not to secure new discoveries, but to have government act in the market. Companies want to prevent cheaper or better products by competing firms from entering the market, and &quot;intellectual property&quot; is one of the better tools used to achieve this end. This is obliviously wrong, so it is up to government to step up like they did in 1620 and stop the abuse, but so far the trend has been to add more abuse, more government involvement in the market, and ever increasing number of royal decrees.",1396270081

There are many cases where men report decreased sexual performance as a result of watching too much porn (that is a harm particularly if it interferes with close intimate relationships).  If nothing else, that is a harm.  Does it cause harm on the balance?  That, however, is unknowable.<p>But the harms which are readily documented don&#x27;t match the harms which are posited.  The harms which are posited are also readily observed but a causal connection is impossible to draw.  Our culture has for the better part of a century (since probably the 1920&#x27;s or at least 1930&#x27;s) slowly been decoupling sexuality, marriage, and reproduction.  Pornography may be seen as a consequence of that separation, but it certainly cannot be seen as the primary cause given the timing.  Whether it furthers and further entrenches a pattern of hedonistic sex may indeed not matter -- it is only one small piece of a much larger cultural pattern.<p>So in the end, I don&#x27;t know if it causes the harms portrayed.  What is clear is that a failure to deal with the context rather than the technology is a much larger problem.",1396269748

The same is (or can be) applied to IPv6 now.<p>As for the scarcity of movies.  Well, that&#x27;s a tough one.  First, there is no way I can <i>actually</i> steal a movie —short of abducting the director, stealing the props… I mean, all I can do is download a copy at almost zero charge.

As you say, it takes resources to make a film: time, cameras, actors, props… most of which are scarce —some are not, like stock footage.  Once the film is done however, the film <i>itself</i> is not scarce at all: it can be copied over and over at near zero cost.<p>The easy way out is to go back to scarcity: you know how to monetize it: just sell the artificially scarce copies.  But this is obviously not ideal.  Our world is sufficiently flawed as it is, adding artificial scarcity on top of it doesn&#x27;t sound like a great idea.<p>Hence the question: how do you distribute something abundant when the production of the first copy consumes scarce resources?  I don&#x27;t know.  But people are working on it, and have produced some ideas that are worth trying: global licence, basic income… Or maybe just lower the length of the granted monopolies, like 10 years after publication or so.

Reason being, in order to innovate, you need to treach into territory previously unexplored, meaning you need to accept the fact that there is a 95% or more of a chance that something will inevitably break, and it will break badly. Successful leaders not only accept failure, they embrace it. There is so much someone can tell you about their failures, and if you&#x27;re lucky you may spot them happening to you, however there is no comparison when it happens from your own experience. A good analogy is sailing through a storm based on reading a book, or having sailed through a storm before, which do you think will complete their journey?<p>I also believe a big part of the so-called &quot;PhD thinking&quot; is they are willing to accept the fact that the 3-10 years of work they put in will be absolutely destroyed by their peers. It&#x27;s that willingness to take a chance that drives them. Without it most things we know today would not exist<p>So basically, if you want your dream job, embrace failure and reach for the stars.

The Debian repositories seem quite close to that offering, at least by their breadth. Arch Linux&#x27;s core repositories offer a high quality up-to-date minimal set, while their community and AUR repos offer a very wide set of 3rd party software, even if the latter is not always reliable.<p>Even though I like a lot about FreeBSD, I always found the ports the most awkward and error-prone part of it.

7500866,comment,7498312,7499432,3,0,oggy,,,"I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really the foundations that are the biggest barrier to entry for mathematicians (at least for most fields of math). Admittedly, I don&#x27;t have experience with dependent-type based systems such as Coq/Agda, which, incidentally, are what the authors use to formalize their Univalent Foundations. But at least for HOL-based systems (e.g. Isabelle/HOL or HOL4), you don&#x27;t really need to understand their foundations in order to work with them. Oddly enough, they&#x27;re neither the standard (first-order, that is, predicate logic based) ZFC theory, nor the Univalent foundations.<p>Isabelle in particular already has reasonably large formalizations of classic results in analysis and linear algebra. It also has a nice structured input language which makes the proofs relatively similar to the standard mathematical language. Here&#x27;s a formalization of the Hahn-Banach theorem (a central result of functional analysis):<p><a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/library/HOL/HOL-Hahn_Banach/Hahn_Banach.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/library/H...</a><p>(the rendering is not complete, as many special symbols aren&#x27;t replaced in the HTML version - it looks nicer when opened in Isabelle itself). If you&#x27;re interested in learning more, you can start with the &quot;new&quot; tutorial:<p><a href=""http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2013-2/doc/prog-prove.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/Isabelle2...</a><p>Anyway, I think that computer proofs are going to remain harder for the foreseeable future, no matter what the foundations. Human written proofs tend to skip and conflate many small steps, and this is exactly what makes them easier and faster to write. Ideally, the verification system would perform this small steps automatically on your behalf. They&#x27;re getting better at that (the sledgehammer tool in Isabelle is great), but still very far away from what you&#x27;d need.<p>Until that happens I don&#x27;t expect to see pervasive machine-assisted proofs anywhere. Not least because of the dynamics of modern academia. It&#x27;s publish or perish, and if doing computer proofs slows you down, a lot of people are going to chose not to do them, and this sets a standard in the field (where such proofs are not particularly valued).<p>The whole post of course comes with a big caveat: I&#x27;m not familiar with Univalent Foundations (I watched the video but that doesn&#x27;t really discuss them). If I&#x27;m wrong in my views I would love some UF experts to chime in.",1396267410
