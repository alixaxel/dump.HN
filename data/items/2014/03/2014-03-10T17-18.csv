7374554,comment,7373624,7373624,1,0,Kronopath,,,"This is why, when describing or introducing myself to others, I often avoid using the words &quot;I am&quot; at all. Compare:<p>&quot;I&#x27;m a C++ software developer, computer graphics/desktop application programmer, and hobbyist game developer.&quot;<p>To:<p>&quot;I work as a software developer. I have thorough experience with C++, particularly in computer graphics and desktop consumer applications, and I enjoy doing some game development as a hobby.&quot;<p>Which one of these people seems more flexible? More capable? More well-rounded?<p>This idea is powerful, because the more you internalize things like this as part of your identity, the more you limit yourself. You end up pigeonholing yourself, both in your own eyes and in the eyes of others. Describing myself with the second method also allows me to go on about other things I&#x27;ve done: how I have some experience with Python, Ruby, Clojure, Javascript, and even Prolog, how I&#x27;ve dabbled in AI, machine learning, signal processing, and web design, or even how, although I work as a software developer, I have an interest in the arts, like music and graphic design, and a broad background in many science and engineering disciplines. Not so with the first method—it comes across like I&#x27;m defining the absolute extent of my character.<p>And this doesn&#x27;t apply just professionally, either. You start thinking yourself as &quot;an X&quot;, and chances are your behaviour will align to what you think &quot;an X&quot; should do rather than what is right or best for you specifically. And &quot;X&quot; can be anything from &quot;C++ developer&quot; or &quot;front-end web developer&quot;, to &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;, to &quot;atheist&quot; or &quot;Christian&quot;, to &quot;American&quot; or &quot;European&quot;. Each one of these puts a straitjacket on your identity, and doing this can tangibly influence not only your self-image but also your actions.<p>Some further reading on that last note: <a href=""http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/10/05/the-benjamin-franklin-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youarenotsosmart.com/2011/10/05/the-benjamin-franklin...</a>",1394474383

Apple phones are more polished, more logically organized, easier to use, more intuitive... fair enough. But more advanced? Not by a long shot. The amount of features and customizable options on Android is insane. You can argue that this is not necessarily a good thing for the average user, but you can&#x27;t make the claim that iOS is more advanced. It&#x27;s simply not.<p>EDIT: OK, fair enough.

I handle all the data processing, generating maps, keeping servers up and running, mobile device provisioning, equipment testing, warranty, tech support, etc, etc.<p>There are a couple of areas that have tried to DIY, with limited success, they usually simply don&#x27;t have the technical knowledge on staff.  I&#x27;ve been surprised myself at the breadth of technical turf I&#x27;ve had to cover to create something that works reliably and simply.  For a reasonably technical software engineer with a bit of hardware experience, it&#x27;s not a big deal, but for everyone else, it&#x27;s too complex a problem.<p>One of the really interesting problems I had to solve was reliably figuring out which trail the grooming equipment was traversing.  Unlike roadways, the GPS data for the trails is typically either non-existent, inaccurate or just plain wrong.  Cleaning that up is a bit of effort for each ski area.  In addition, ski trails are often in much closer proximity than roadways, which combined with GPS error margins, means that I had to do some fairly gnarly stuff to avoid jumping between nearby trails constantly.  It looks simple enough on the surface, but it required some real hair-pulling to get working reliably.<p>Contract negotiations with cell-network providers weren&#x27;t much fun either.  Many ski areas are in pretty marginal cell-network coverage regions, so finding devices that behaved well in that environment was critical (in addition to handling very cold weather, i.e. -40F for 8 hour stretches).  The grooming staff are typically completely non-technical, working weird shift hours, etc, so the system has to be completely hands-off after installation.  Finding a device that would do that, handle the harsh environment and be properly certified to operate on the north american mobile networks was no easy task.",1394474266

Once you know what they&#x27;re good for, everyone likes binary formats that can be easily shared across multiple languages via code gen. You can turn every binary format into text-based for debugging purposes using standard commands. Heck, even Apple has binary plists.

However, the group I work with, the program in the businessy sense, is not very old. The original kernel of the group began less than ten years ago, and has grown in fits and spurts. Many, if not most, of the &quot;founders&quot; are still here, as well.<p>When the program started, many of the founders were young and relatively inexperienced. Today, they&#x27;re still young but are more experienced---in this specific project.

(Disclaimer:  I&#x27;m a non-Haskell programmer who&#x27;s been trying to get his head around some of this stuff, but who may well have it wrong.)<p>You&#x27;ve got a function f that will do something to one or more values.  That function already exists, and it works.<p>But f works on regular values.  You also have some &quot;special&quot; values.  chas described it as having a context; the way I&#x27;ve come to think about it is that the value is in some kind of jail.  You can&#x27;t just operate on it freely.  (There are a number of different kinds of jails, but all of them mean that you can&#x27;t just operate freely on the value.)<p>What we&#x27;re talking about here, then, is a smuggling operation.  It lets you get your function f to the values (or the values to the function, depending on your point of view) so that it can operate on the values.  What&#x27;s a bit neater is that it lets you separate f from the smuggling, so that f remains unchanged.  And you can use the same smuggling scaffolding for any f.<p>How has this simplified code in the real world?  I have no idea, but I think I can tell you one place where it doesn&#x27;t.  Haskell tries to be purely functional, but it can&#x27;t quite pull it off in the area of I/O (kind of by definition - if you&#x27;re going to have I/O, you <i>can&#x27;t</i> be purely functional).  So Haskell does I/O in a jail.  You use this kind of stunt to get access to I/O values.  (Does that make it any less a violation of pure functional programming?  Not that I can see.  Perhaps they&#x27;re trying to contain the contamination?)<p>But in C++, you&#x27;d just drop out of functional programming for a line or two, and do stream I/O.  You wouldn&#x27;t have this problem at all, so you wouldn&#x27;t need this solution.<p>As I said, I&#x27;m trying to understand this stuff, and I&#x27;m pretty sure I understand it imperfectly.

A Ponzi scheme is a particular type of scam that is pretty well defined.<p>> ...  it would appear that older investors are being paid off at the expense of the newer investors<p>I guess this is the core of it; the definition uses the passive voice and thus is open to this interpretation.  I think it&#x27;s clear, both historically and looking at examples, that the definition would be more clear as:<p><pre><code>    A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation, where the operator\n    pays returns to its investors from existing capital or new capital paid\n    by new investors, rather than from profit earned by the operator.\n    Operators of Ponzi schemes usually entice new investors by offering higher\n    returns than other investments, in the form of short-term returns that are\n    either abnormally high or unusually consistent.\n</code></pre>\nHere I&#x27;ve modified the language slightly (and I&#x27;ve edited the wikipedia page as well, but we&#x27;ll see if that holds up).  In the Apple example, there is no operator, so there&#x27;s really no chance that it is a Ponzi scheme.  Similarly for the Bitcoin case.<p>You can make the argument that Bitcoin (or Apple stock) is a scam of some sort; a &quot;pump and dump&quot; seems the most apt analogue.

Here&#x27;s a simplified account of the last 20 years or so:<p>I spend 10+ years working for a mid-size company, progressing from developer to a sort of combination senior developer / IT manager. My salary grew at a reasonable pace. I was wearing a lot of different hats, and gained experience in a lot of different areas. That company went out of business a few years ago.<p>I then spent a couple of years at a small (12 person) web dev company. We had one in-house product and worked on various sites for various clients. Mostly ASP.NET, some Drupal. I took a bit of a salary hit there, making maybe 85% of my previous salary.<p>I left that company about a year ago, and am now at a fairly large company, primarily working on Dynamics AX custom programming, with some random ASP.NET/C# stuff in there too. I&#x27;m still not back at my old salary, from the company that went under, but I&#x27;m closer.<p>With a little more Dynamics AX work under my belt, I could probably jump ship for an AX consulting job that would get me back to that old salary. Or I could stay here and make a pretty reasonable salary, with modest gains, over the next several years. (There doesn&#x27;t seem to be much room to move into management here, though if I stay long enough, that may change.)<p>Or I could try to go back to another web dev position, ASP.NET and/or Drupal, maybe. (That probably wouldn&#x27;t get me much of a salary bump though.)<p>I&#x27;m not entirely sure what I&#x27;ll be doing ten years from now. The company I&#x27;m at now is stable enough that I might be able to stay here until retirement, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on it. I&#x27;ll probably need to change jobs 2 or 3 more times before retirement. I try to keep my skills up to date, so I can stay employable, and, at some point, I&#x27;ll probably start using the standard 50+ tricks on my resume: dropping my college graduation date, dropping the oldest jobs from the resume entirely, etc. And dyeing my hair maybe, if I get too grey.<p>This being HN, other people have of course talked about starting their own company. I&#x27;m not sure I want to do that, but it may become an attractive option at some point, especially if the health care situation in the US gets straightened out enough that I can afford to pay for my own health insurance.",1394471995

In what field?<p>The people who claim that women are discriminated against purely based on gender. If women really are being discriminated based on gender, and companies are hiring less qualified men in favor of more qualified women, then someone should be able to hire up all of the women who are being snubbed by all of the sexist companies and have a competitive advantage over them, right? Same situation with older people, right? Unless of course if this isn&#x27;t about age or sex. I&#x27;m female and not getting any younger by the way. But I still don&#x27;t buy the bull others try to sell.<p>>Age discrimination in this context applies to employee hiring.<p>Are older people better employees or worse? Are they hiring based on age or the other things and age is only an easy thing to blame?<p>>Is &quot;risk taking&quot; a criteria your company applies when looking for talent?<p>No startup is a sure thing. Younger people are less risk averse. It&#x27;s not that a company wants people who will take risks it&#x27;s that older people want more of a sure thing. They walk in and expect a salary which matches their years of experience, while most places hiring have no use for their experience. Their experience would add no value to their business, and so hiring a younger person who does not demand such a high salary is a better option.<p>>For one thing, the market can&#x27;t reward new approaches if no-one tries them.<p>There is no law keeping the people clamoring about ageism from do that. No one can force others to nor should they be able to. Clearly if they believe that hiring older people is such a good move they should be able to make a lot of money.<p>I&#x27;m unaware of laws which make it harder or impossible for older people to get hired?",1394471562

Never hit a plateau in pay, but nonetheless, I&#x27;ve found the best way to ratchet up is to change jobs which has been sad, but true - I&#x27;ve left some pretty decent jobs because somebody else was willing to pay more. This has been true in every decade of my career.<p>There&#x27;s been a constant push towards management that I&#x27;ve always resisted. People I&#x27;ve known who have gone into management generally didn&#x27;t really want to be programming - it was just the means to kick start their careers. The same is true for any STEM field that isn&#x27;t academic. If you want to go into management, do it, but if you don&#x27;t and you&#x27;re being pushed into it, talk to your boss. Any decent boss wants to keep good developers and will be happy to accomodate your desire to keep coding - they probably think they&#x27;re doing you a favor by pushing you toward management.<p>I don&#x27;t recommend becoming a specialist in any programming paradigm because you don&#x27;t know what is coming next. Be a generalist, but keep learning everything you can. So far I&#x27;ve coded professionally in COBOL, Basic, Fortran, C, Ada, C++, APL, Java, Python, PERL, C#, Clojure and various assembly languages each one of which would have been tempting to become a specialist in. Somebody else pointed out that relearning the same thing over and over in new contexts gets old and that can be true, but I don&#x27;t see how it can be avoided as long as there doesn&#x27;t exist the &quot;one true language&quot;. That said, I&#x27;ve got a neighbor about my age who still makes a great living as a COBOL programmer on legacy systems.<p>Now for the important part if you want to keep programming and you aren&#x27;t an academic. If you want to make a living being a programmer, you can count on a decent living, but if you want to do well and have reasonable job security you&#x27;ve got to learn about and become an expert in something else - ideally something you&#x27;re actually coding. Maybe it&#x27;s banking, or process control, or contact management - it doesn&#x27;t matter as long as it&#x27;s something. As a developer, you are coding stuff that&#x27;s important to somebody or they wouldn&#x27;t be paying you to do it. Learn what you&#x27;re coding beyond the level that you need just to get your work done. You almost for certain have access to resources since you need them to do your job, and if you don&#x27;t figure out how to get them. Never stop learning.",1394470979

They are not an investment opportunity or a vessel for your own unfulfilled aspirations. If you make your kids feel that you&#x27;re disappointed in them you&#x27;re just going to make them miserable and resentful and you&#x27;ll have a lousy relationship as adults.

BuiltWith is one such service: <a href=""http://builtwith.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://builtwith.com</a> ... NerdyData & Datanyze also: <a href=""http://nerdydata.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nerdydata.com</a>, <a href=""http://www.datanyze.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.datanyze.com</a><p>Subscribers use these tools to find people who are trying out competing services (they are not cheap, BTW). Often, if a site only recently added JS code–for example, say, KissMetrics–you can assume they are still in the trial period. That gives you a window of time to try and sell them on your competing product. Or, if you sell a special WordPress plugin, you can use these services to find WordPress sites.<p>Stripe doesn&#x27;t have a trial period per se, but its pretty easy to switch between the modern payment providers and if it was only recently installed, its safe to assume you don&#x27;t have a lot of customers yet.",1394470885
