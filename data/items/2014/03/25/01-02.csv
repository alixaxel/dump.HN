7463272,comment,7462818,7463212,3,0,ekianjo,,,"> There is nothing in the US constitution that actually allows secession<p>True, but there is nothing that forbids it either explicitly. And I could argue that from the History of the US, of how they were formed, and the Declaration of Independence, Secession is very much considered to be a cultural Right.<p>Even Lincoln said that:<p>> Any people, anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. This is a most valuable, a most sacred right, a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world.<p>This is further observed by foreign observers such as Tocqueville after the US were established:<p>> The Union was formed by the voluntary agreement of the States; and in uniting together they have not forfeited their nationality, nor have they been reduced to the condition of one and the same people. If one of the States choose to withdraw from the compact, it would be difficult to disprove its right of doing so, and the Federal Government would have no means of maintaining its claims directly either by force or right.",1395712736

I actually don&#x27;t know how long it&#x27;ll last since it&#x27;s never died. Definitely not two weeks, but long enough for me to not really worry about the battery life.<p>All that said, I can definitely see the appeal of a phone that lasts two weeks. I think the Note 3 sits at a decent compromise between that and my old phone, a Galaxy S3, which could barely last 8 hours (of typical, very intermittent usage).",1395712696

7463264,comment,7462854,7463241,5,0,adventured,,,"Good luck starting new companies? Why yes indeed in fact. I&#x27;m very well versed on the history of the free market in America for example, circa 19th and early 20th century. There was no problem in starting companies - in fact it was a boom time for entrepreneurialism - despite the extremely low level of regulation.<p>If there was a market opportunity to make money, capital was available. For every juggernaut there were numerous others that wanted to chop that juggernaut down to size. JP Morgan, Rockefeller, Carnegie, they all had countless large enemies willing to finance competitors.<p>Why should it be easy in a free market to start a union inside of a company? Free markets don&#x27;t guarantee you have a right to a job or a right to start a union at a company. In a case where the employees don&#x27;t own the company, assuming they&#x27;re strictly labor, they agree to work there and get paid for it, or they can quit. That&#x27;s a free market for labor. You also don&#x27;t have to work at a company to attempt to organize its labor in a free market.<p>(also I should note, my intentions aren&#x27;t to have a debate on the pros and cons of free market economics, but rather to describe what a free market for labor actually is)",1395712677

In the UK, home loan products each have max LTV (loan-to-value) thresholds, and prices are inversely related to those (though not linearly of course).  Lenders don&#x27;t care whether the LTV being less than 100% is the result of years of saving, a gift from parents, a windfall of some kind, or just because you happened to make money when you sold your previous property.  They care mainly about the LTV (which affects their downside risk) and the ratio of your regular monthly income to the monthly payments (to make sure you can comfortably afford the repayments).<p>Do you disagree with my statement, or are you just pointing out that the down payment is only one of the factors which affects the risk of the loan, and that the risk of the loan is only factor which affects the lender&#x27;s decision?",1395712661

If that&#x27;s the case, then removing the &quot;cold calls&quot; from the talent search might have had the effect of actually driving up salaries for those not working at these companies, since potentially reduced the supply.<p>If that&#x27;s the case, then it would not have saved money, rather, it would have had the effect of simply shifting the money from going to existing Google/Apple/etc employees to applicants from smaller firms.<p>That is, it changed the distribution of spending, and probably in a more egalitarian way, distributing the spending over a larger pool, instead of simply fighting over, and raising the wages, of the small group of superstars at the big companies.<p>These companies are spending on R&D and increasing the percentage year over year, they are also spending huge sums of acqui-hires, and hiring faster than the local communities, or their own office space, can handle.<p>You could argue that excessive salaries are actually bad for allocation.

I can&#x27;t stress how useful it is being able to just add a line and you get such powerful support.<p>I haven&#x27;t had time to add git hooks yet, but thats the next stage, I plan to set the hooks to run tests and clamp down on poor quality code (I work with interns quite often... sometimes I cry for just average quality code coming in).<p>For a story of the production gains I&#x27;ve had.

If you assume (as US law does) that intellectual property has a value and its theft is equivalent to theft of physical property, then it makes sense that it&#x27;s a criminal offense in the same way as a physical theft (and probably also a civil matter).<p>Not all intellectual property is legally protected against theft this way though (otherwise any disclosure of IP could be theft). The bar for intellectual property to be legally considered a trade secret is high. If the IP isn&#x27;t sufficiently secret, it&#x27;s legally less clear whether you can really steal it. Just stamping it &quot;secret&quot; isn&#x27;t enough. To be a trade secret the company needs to prove that it&#x27;s a secret, that the secrecy of the IP is highly valuable (for instance loss of the IP&#x27;s secrecy hurts a competitive advantage), and that they&#x27;ve made significant attempts to keep it secret by limiting access to &quot;need-to-know&quot; people and protecting the IP though appropriate security and secrecy.<p>In this case, it sounds like the defendant may have gained physical access to a building he didn&#x27;t legally have access to (ie company made an attempt to limit access with some security) and copied data off a server. MS is arguing that this hurt them financially.<p>A defense against this might be to claim that even if the data might have been valuable and releasing it harmed the company, they didn&#x27;t treat it with enough secrecy/security for it to be considered a trade secret.

There are quilting clubs, and hiking clubs, and bee keeping clubs. Some of these organizations are over a century old. There are science cafes, and book readings, public lectures, and temperance organizations. I don&#x27;t think hackers are notably more organized than other skillsets.<p>For example, near where I live are two rowing clubs, both with their own clubhouses and storage areas. I used to be a member of a tango organization, with its own membership structure and bank account. It would organize events, and bring in guest teachers. And so on. What is special about hackerspaces?<p>> What physical resources do you need to study such subjects?<p>Are you asking me because you don&#x27;t have any experience with those programs, nor have any friends who participated in them? If so, that would suggest a large gap in your understanding of how colleges work.<p>A music program will have a large range of instruments, including large instruments like a pipe organ and more exotic instruments like a gamelan (and people who can build/maintain/tune the instruments), practice spaces, and performance spaces. An art program will have equipment ranging from paints and brushes to kilns to welding equipment and perhaps even a foundry. Some of these require support staff. A theater program will have performance spaces, costumes and props, plus again support people (eg, a licensed carpenter for stage building, someone to oversee the electrics, etc.)<p>This is not something that every small town will have, which is why people go somewhere else where those resources can be concentrated.<p>> Do you think organising practice space and meeting likeminded individuals would be hard outside college?<p>Umm, yes? That&#x27;s my point. In my town of 70,000 people, there probably aren&#x27;t enough like-minded individuals interested in, say, early medieval music. Certainly not enough to have the instruments on-hand. While &quot;[t]he Early Music Institute at the Jacobs School of Music [at Indiana University] provides a comprehensive program in the study of historical performance on original instruments of music before ca.1800.&quot; (See <a href=""http://www.music.indiana.edu/departments/academic/early-music/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.music.indiana.edu/departments/academic/early-musi...</a> , which also points out that commuting faculty and students &quot;makes it difficult to offer such a well-rounded educational experience and to have major ensembles of such caliber&quot;.)<p>Or take the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, which has &quot;theatrical spaces outfitted with state-of-the-art intelligent lighting systems to animation studios equipped with the latest 3D computer graphics software.&quot; How does one get access to that sort of equipment, and put on a play which uses it, in a hackerspace model?<p>> why pay huge sums of money for that privilege when it&#x27;s possible to arrange in a more straightforward way<p>You&#x27;ve changed the topic. You originally said &quot;Colleges offer five things (from an academic point of view)&quot;, while I said that physical access to peers is a sixth.<p>Physical peer proximity, in the hackerspace model, is hard to arrange for many subjects. I studied physics. There are some 5,000-6,000 physics graduates each year. (See <a href=""http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201112/backpage.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201112/backpage.cfm</a> and <a href=""http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2008/04/13/the-extreme-deficit-of-physics-undergraduates-aps-april-2008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2008/04/13/the-extr...</a> ).<p>How does one establish a &quot;physics space&quot; when there are so few others in one&#x27;s immediate neighborhood who are interested in learning particle physics? This seems like a prime reason to concentrate physics studies in one geographic area, and have people move there to study and to teach. In other words, college. Isn&#x27;t that more straightforward than what you propose? (If not, how would your model be more effective than what we have now?)<p>I feel when you said &quot;I&#x27;m sure that makes learning more fun&quot; that you didn&#x27;t get the point. This wasn&#x27;t for fun, this was peer education. A few years ago a friend told me &quot;I don&#x27;t think I could have graduated without your help.&quot; And I know myself well enough to know that I do better with physical proximity than telepresence. There are <i>educational</i> benefits of learning with peers.<p>Focusing now on &quot;why pay huge sums of money for that privilege&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s also a different topic, and you didn&#x27;t bring it up earlier. I agree with you - college should not cost huge sums of money. I think higher education is a social good and should be supported by the state, either free or highly subsidized.

Of course, most people at that level of income are not living like paupers in their million dollar houses, savagely squirreling money away (as $250K minus $11.6K/month for mortgage and savings only leaves $2,300/month for car(s), bills, entertainment, etc), so it&#x27;s probably a reasonably safe assumption that it&#x27;s at least $300K.<p>It&#x27;s interesting your perspective that you wouldn&#x27;t consider yourself &#x27;wealthy&#x27; unless you had (either) $6M in savings, or a (household?) income of $10M+ / year, when in reality, &quot;You are the 2%&quot;.",1395709689

When a user installs an updated package, the platform offers to replace the old package.<p>Automatic/push updates will be implemented eventually.<p>> does it use zerovm?<p>No, Sandstorm has a custom sandbox implemented on the same Linux kernel features underlying Docker.  This means that existing Linux binaries can run in the Sandstorm sandbox.
