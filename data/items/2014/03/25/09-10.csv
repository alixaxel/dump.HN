7464839,comment,7463671,7463671,10,0,vijucat,,,"&quot;Look, he couldn&#x27;t even copy stdin to stdout, LOLOL&quot;.<p>The most probable reason for the failure is because Java is not used in industry that much as a shell programming environment. The most common use case for Java is as a server-side, long-running server, with C++-like performance and without C++-like headaches. I work with algorithmic trading engines in my job. Though I trade personally these days and the orders are small, the engines I implemented for banks typically handle $250m worth orders per stock exchange. I have NEVER, not in a single instance in the last 5 years, have had to read from stdin in Java. Why : in my particular niche in my industry, input comes via a socket that is abstracted away by an engine that implements the FIX (Financial Information eXchange) protocol. For all practical purposes, in the finance industry, the FIX library / server IS stdin and stdout. This doesn&#x27;t make a colleague of mine who forgot how to access stdin in Java a nincompoop. It&#x27;s a failure to remember what is rarely used, not a failure to perform basic job duties. See the difference?<p>I believe the author is / was a Perl expert? That&#x27;s why he thinks being able to read stdin is &quot;so basic&quot;. I challenge the author to confront his prejudices : hire a few candidates who fail the stdin / stdout test. If they are allowed to do the damn work instead of jumping through your Perl-shaped hoops, they might have actually done quite well on the job.<p>Similarly, many Perl programmers would fail a test devised by someone who is used to Java.",1395741364

7464816,comment,7463671,7464582,8,0,einhverfr,,,">  Many newer or more fashionable languages enable some very elegant programming styles, but this comes with a concern about the elegance of one&#x27;s code, which can easily result in the programmer spending more time thinking about elegance than about functionality.<p>This isn&#x27;t a bad tradeoff though.  Elegance means generally gains in maintainability, possibly with lesser costs in the actual development.  And thinking about elegance in code is the first step to writing better, more maintainable code.<p>> For example... should I use map or reduce here, or maybe an iterator, or... oh fuck it, I&#x27;ll use a for loop. It turns out that the old-school for loop works just as well despite earning you precisely zero style points.<p>I usually stick with for loops because they are clear.  Remember:<p><i>elegance is about simplicity and clarity.  If you sacrifice either of these, you are reducing the elegance of your code.</i>",1395741037

You seem to be on the &quot;Worse&quot; side, ie. the UNIX/C/Java side, and claim the moral of WIB to be that perfect is the enemy of good. That&#x27;s a perfectly fair argument.<p>However, on the &quot;Better&quot; side, ie. the LISP/Haskell side, the moral of WIB is that time-to-market is hugely important. It&#x27;s not that the &quot;Better&quot; side was bogged-down in philosophical nuance and was chasing an unattainable perfectionism; it&#x27;s that their solutions took a bit longer to implement. For example, according to Wikipedia C came out in &#x27;72 and Scheme came out in &#x27;75. Scheme is clearly influenced by philosophy and perfectionism, but it&#x27;s also a solid language with clear goals.<p>The problem is that Scheme and C were both trying to solve the &#x27;decent high-level language&#x27; problem, but since C came out first, fewer people cared about Scheme when it eventually came out. In the mean time they&#x27;d moved on to tackling the &#x27;null pointer dereference in C problem&#x27;, the &#x27;buffer overflow in C&#x27; problem, the &#x27;unterminated strings in C&#x27; problem, and so on. Even though Scheme doesn&#x27;t have these problems, it also doesn&#x27;t solve them &quot;in C&quot;, so it was too difficult to switch to.<p>Of course, this is a massive simplification and there have been many other high level languages before and since, but it illustrates the other side of the argument: if your system solves a problem, people will work around far more crappiness than you might think.<p>More modern examples are Web apps (especially in the early days), Flash, Silverlight, etc. and possibly the Web itself.",1395740763

JIT speeds up bytecode execution - but if you trace the execution of this code you&#x27;ll see we often end up crossing between JVM land and native land via JNI to push output to write(2) or pull input from read(2). Crossing the JNI boundary is not free and cannot be optimized with JIT (there&#x27;s lots of data copying back and forth - maybe some memory pinning etc). Using explicit buffers, you pay this overhead less often. Increasing the buffer size reduces the overhead - but of course with diminishing returns. Using read()/write(int) you pay this penalty more frequently. In general it&#x27;s almost always a bad idea to use single element methods when the interface also exposes bulk methods and you want to do bulk work.<p>> A test which the original code, and your initial review, failed on multiple fronts (failed to handle character encoding issues and failed to flush the output stream before exiting).<p>Mea culpa - OP & I had similar idea and a quick scan of the code seemed generally correct. If I was interviewing him / her I would spend more than a second reading the provided code.<p>> I honestly find it hard to believe that Java devs would have their skills sets be terribly different regardless of platform they run on, and I really would think people would learn the basics of working with streams regardless of the platform they work with, but I grok the gist of what you are saying.<p>I&#x27;d still argue that stdin/stdout/stderr are <i>instances</i> of IO streams. I&#x27;d hope all programmers are relatively confident with manipulating IO streams. But these particular instances are really familiar to people working in Unix and uncommon to Windows people. I&#x27;d rather have the candidate thinking about streams and not fumbling in the back of their mind kind of remembering what stdout is.<p>> FizzBuzz doesn&#x27;t really test for knowledge of the language&#x27;s libraries though.<p>Granted - but I think this thread illustrates that there are a ton of other aspects besides standard library knowledge in play when you dig into this question. If you want to know if the person sitting in front of you can program, FizzBuzz. If you want to know if they grasp the language&#x27;s standard libraries - ask them a question that requires using collections. If you want to see if they understand the platform their running on do something with File IO.... and so on.",1395740278

Frameworks and libraries are great for increasing productivity, but horrible for actually learning. You don&#x27;t start learning Chinese by reading Sun Tzu in Chinese, you start by learning to say &#x27;hello&#x27;, right? This goes for frameworks too. Eventually you&#x27;ll need them, but now is not the time.<p>If you want to be a decent web developer, it&#x27;s essential that you learn how things work from the beginning. Frameworks don&#x27;t teach you that. I really suggest you try to build a simple app from the ground up. Nothing fancy, just a simple time tracking app, personal page or something. Or start with just a static HTML/CSS page. Add a database/server side later when you get the hang of HTML/CSS. Done? Begin sprinkling some jQuery in it. By this time you can begin thinking about frameworks.<p>It&#x27;s a long road, sure. But if you begin small there&#x27;s a much, much better chance of mastering web development.

The pecuniary recompence, therefore, of painters and sculptors, of lawyers and physicians, ought to be much more liberal; and it is so accordingly....  We trust our health to the physician, our fortune, and sometimes our life and reputation, to the lawyer and attorney....  Fifthly, the wages of labour in different employments vary according to the probability or improbability of success in them.  The probability that any particular person shall ever be qualified for the employments to which he is educated, is very different in different occupations.

Many of the features of Unix could have been implemented in a &quot;better&quot; way, and these ways were known to people working at the time.  But it turns out that those &quot;better&quot; options are much more difficult to implement, harder to get right and are ultimately counter-productive to the goal of delivering software that works.  We can set up clear, logical arguments as to why doing things the Unix way is worse than doing things another way (e.g. how Lisp Machines would do it), but it turns out that the Unix approach is just more effective.  Basically, although we can invent aesthetic or philosophical standards of correctness for programs, actually trying to follow these in the real world is dangerous (beyond a certain point, anyway).<p>I think that&#x27;s pretty similar to the OP&#x27;s argument that, whilst Haskell is clearly a superior language to Java in many respects, writing code properly in Haskell is much harder than doing so in Java because, probably for entirely cultural reasons, a programmer working with Haskell feels a greater need to write the &quot;correct&quot; program rather than the one that just works.  Java gives the programmer an excuse to abandon perfectionism, producing code that is &quot;worse&quot; but an outcome that is &quot;better&quot;.<p>I think I know what you&#x27;re getting at, which is that a comparison between Unix and the monstrous IDE-generated Java bloatware described in the OP is insulting to Unix.  On this you are correct.  But for &quot;worse is better&quot; to be meaningful, there still has to be some recognition that, yes, Unix really is <i>worse</i> than the ideal.  Unix isn&#x27;t the best thing that could ever possibly exist, it&#x27;s just the best thing that the people at the time could build, and nobody has ever come up with a better alternative.",1395738476
