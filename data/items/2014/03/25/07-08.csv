If you (say) add a new field to an existing type, this will screw up pattern matching. It&#x27;s a bit inconvenient, but typically not a big deal. On the other hand, if your previously non-nullable String field becomes a Maybe String, you&#x27;re going to have to update every location where you access it... and that&#x27;s exactly what a reasonable programmer wants to do. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t encode this in Javascript, so you&#x27;re going to resort to &#x27;grep&#x27; (good luck if you have the same field name for several objects), or forget about it and get runtime errors. Sure, in theory you can rely on your Javascript unit tests to detect the error, and you may be right in practice, or you may be out of luck.<p>Generally speaking, Haskell has its fair share of problems, but it&#x27;s not one of them.<p>> If I start a project tomorrow in Haskell or Python, the GP&#x27;s post is saying my Python project will be completed quicker but be less correct.<p>It definitely matches my own experience (it obviously depends on your proficiency in both languages, and Haskell will have only marginal advantages if you use String everywhere because types are hard).<p>> He is also saying that the amount of time I spend maintaining my Python project over the next few years will be higher than time spent maintain a same-feature Haskell project. There is absolutely zero evidence I have seen anywhere that this is correct and from experience it depends far more on the project itself and where the strengths of the language (and libraries!) lie than the language itself.<p>It&#x27;s the kind of thing for which it is extremely hard to get any evidence for (and not only in Haskell vs Javascript debates), for obvious reasons. The best you can say is that the stronger guarantees of correctness offered by a strongly-typed program ensure that it makes it much easier to detect regressions. On the other hand, if, say, there are no third-party libraries for the problem domain at hand, strong typing will not magically fix that.",1395733489

I look back now and in fact that was an illusion generated by a localised point of view. In fact I was making progress the whole time, just slowly enough that at times it didn&#x27;t feel like it.<p>I probably came at things from a fairly opposite place to you, I started with the web. I started with HTML and CSS and kind of worked backwards. But regardless of where you start, there will always be challenges to your understanding. IMO, one thing that marks a promising developer is the ability to be comfortable with feeling like an idiot while you&#x27;re learning something new but continuing to persevere, because the need to learn new things happens so often in our relatively young industry. In my experience, few people truly are able to be comfortable with this feeling, but those who are able can surmount amazing obstacles.<p>So don&#x27;t get discouraged if it feels like you&#x27;re not making progress. Stick with it, you will. It just won&#x27;t seem like it at the time.<p>As you&#x27;ve experienced, the MVC pattern is still very much in ascendance in the web dev world. I would suggest that you invest in a couple of good books (if available) or lengthy tutorials on the framework of your choice (if available). If neither of these things are available, that may be a sign that you should choose a different framework. :) Don&#x27;t invest in too many books though, because you&#x27;ll find they date quite quickly and eventually it will become more efficient to just search for what you need on a case-by-case basis. But to get a good grounding, dropping a bit of coin can be a good thing in the early stages of learning a new technology.<p>0. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)</a><p>1. <a href=""http://norvig.com/21-days.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/21-days.html</a>",1395733122

If Java had Python-like properties, the average size of a Java codebase would shrink by 50 % (though having public final fields everywhere as a convention would work equally well for non-API code - I probably changed a field getter into a computed property once, and it certainly wasn&#x27;t in public-facing code).

Start simple with a server side scripting language to perform the logic of reading and writing to the database. (I started with PHP). Once you have that figured out, each scripting language can talk to a database either using drivers or plugins or a module that can be found (Again, I began with MySQL). Write simple logic to read and persist data. And build from there. This could be any language or database solution, my choices were what happened by chance when I began part-time work as a web developer.<p>Without breaking down a large app into smaller pieces, you&#x27;ll be overwhelmed.

Like, the way you poach one is by offering a better deal (more features, better price, better service, etc).
