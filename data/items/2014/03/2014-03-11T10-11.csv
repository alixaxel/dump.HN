7378482,comment,7377187,7377873,3,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Actually this paper is very interesting. So they did in fact reward employers for employee performance.<p>What I found the most interesting:<p><i>If, instead, we were to impose a random choice on employers, their earnings would drop by\n11.4%, because employers do gain some relevant information from the appearance of the candidates, and this information allows them to make better-than-random choices (as can be seen in Fig. 1, which shows that employers in this condition choose the higher-performing candidate 55% of the time).</i><p><i>If we remove the anti-women bias in expectations [in the case of appearance only], employers would earn only 0.1% more in compensation.</i><p>So it turns out that anti-female bias is almost negligible <i>when basing decisions entirely on candidate appearance</i>. That&#x27;s really surprising to me. I wish they included a table describing how much alpha could be gained by eliminating anti-female bias in all cases.<p>Also, it looks like the best (and least biased) predictor was Past Performance. Surprise surprise. Maybe people will now stop complaining about employers who ask for a github (aka &quot;Past Performance&quot;) instead of a resume (&quot;aka &quot;Cheap Talk&quot;)?",1394535558

7378474,comment,7377187,7378176,0,0,NextUserName,,,"><i>- Women are &quot;less ambitious&quot; because they perceive, often rightly, that their path up the ladder is blocked.</i><p>What evidence is there to support this? There are biological differences (I am talking brain structure and chemistry here) that make men competitive, leaders, and providers. IT feels like you are ignoring nature here.<p>Your argument reminds me of &quot;racial inequality&quot;. Blacks in America are not hired and paid as much as Asians. Is this because of racism, unequal opportunity? If we look at history, we see that Asians generally invented more and modernized their societies (writing, language, arts) far more than Africans living in similar conditions and with similar opportunity (natural resources, friendly weather ETC.). Who can explain this? Is there a biological reason these pattern repeats themselves in all races throughout known history? Is it because of some influence? or just differences in DNA? Clearly in America, despite all our efforts, racial inequality has done nothing but grow. Is it because of reasons beyond our understanding? People claim that it is this reason or that reason, but History does not agree with them.<p>><i>- Women miss more work due to illness and depression because they aren&#x27;t treated fairly and are put under more pressure to get the rewards their male counterparts get easily.</i><p>This is your opinion (which should be stated). This is pretty subjective and I have never seen nor could I find any evidence to support it. It is true that women who do not work get sick less, bit the same is true for men. Workplace illnesses certainly account for some of this. Even if it were provable, what difference does it make. The problem is perpetuated by the problem that exists (cycle).<p>><i>- Women are less amenable to overtime because men are less amenable to doing housework.</i><p>This only partially accounts for the difference. Where comparing single men and women, there is still a difference. You may say that the difference still exists and that men just live like slobs, but I doubt you will find much evidence to support that.<p>><i>- Women can, and do, cope with &quot;hormone fluctuation&quot; very well. They&#x27;re quite used to it.</i><p>Opinion again. You are probably correct with some women, and not so correct with others. This is probably an unknown variable at hire time, thus a risk. In any case, it is an extra thing that most women must deal with. Men with 4 or more kids at home are very rarely hired as CEO&#x27;s. It is partly because they have a known distraction (such as a women&#x27;s hormonal swings). I realize that this is an apples to oranges comparison, but any known detractor for any job translates to points against the applicant.<p>><i>- Attractive women in the workplace are only a distraction to unprofessional, easily distracted men.</i><p>It feels like you are arguing with me here. I am not disagreeing, I am just saying that many workplaces have very valuable and productive men who fall into this category. All boys/girls schools philosophy is to get rid of possible distractions. This segregation is age old in the workplace as well.<p>><i>- Men talking dirty in the workplace just shouldn&#x27;t. Regardless of the (imaginary) sensibilities of women, what about the men who don&#x27;t like that?</i><p>Shouldn&#x27;t I agree, but if you don&#x27;t think that this doesn&#x27;t play a factor, I have to question your grounding in reality.<p>><i>- Men haven&#x27;t been in charge since the beginning of time. History has had plenty of matriarchal societies.</i><p>I said that I was talking in generalities. I am not pointing out minority exceptions like you are. These societies represent such a small percentage of recorded humans existence that they are actually considered statistically insignificant.<p>><i>The simple fact is, any business that doesn&#x27;t select the best possible candidate regardless of gender, is failing their duty to their shareholders/investors/employees to build a secure, stable, profitable and growing company. If I knew that a company I owned part of was recruiting men over women even when the woman is the better candidate I would call for the CEO to be fired.</i><p>It comes down to risk. The things that I have mentioned all play a factor in that risk. All non gender related things being equal, the higher risk would be the female. You can argue with this all day, but you are arguing with nature. Maybe this &quot;inequality&quot; is not &quot;fair&quot;, but trying to force everything to be &quot;fair&quot; and everyone to be &quot;equal&quot; has never worked and never will. Standards are lowered, gags are placed on dissidents, people start hating each other and their government, things decline. Making everything &quot;equal&quot; and &quot;fair&quot; equates to oppression, unfairness in other places and theft. In the end it always ends up bad.

Either the local government, which decided to arbitarily start charging commercial premises 90% of the metered incoming water as wastewater, on the assumption that 90% of what comes out the tap goes down the drain.  Breweries use a lot of water, so that added costs.<p>Then the federal government decided that young people were drinking too many strong pre-mixed drinks (alcopops), so they added a massive alcopops tax (a 70% increase) to try and stop young people drinking (yeah, <i>as if that was going to work</i> [1]).

I think capitalizing Agile as a noun makes it a &quot;thing&quot; that we can refer to collectively and ultimately helps us communicate about the concepts that it entails.  The unfortunate down-side is when a popular term is misused due to ignorance and misunderstanding by a large group of people - which will happen more prevalently as a word becomes popular.<p>As someone who has had the pleasure of receiving Scrum coaching from Jeff Sutherland, I can say that there is a HUGE difference in understanding between people who spend time to learn it (from a book or coach) and those who muddle their way through - never taking the time to learn about it more deeply and put it to practical use (the only way to truly learn is through doing).<p>I work at a small company and teach an internal course on the principles of Scrum to our project managers, so I have first-hand exposure here.  It&#x27;s amazing how really smart people who have heard the terms used for several years and even claim to have been involved in Scrum teams at past jobs still have many misconceptions about the core principles and how to practically apply them when the situation arises.  There is definitely a shallow understanding amongst a good majority of developers and it&#x27;s exacerbated by companies that claim to use &quot;Agile&quot; practices yet have only really scratched the surface. It&#x27;s immediately clear that many have used &quot;Scrum-but&quot; and really only do standup meetings as if that will be all that is needed.  Actually many people think Scrum is &quot;that process where you hold standup meetings&quot;.<p>I like Scrum because it brings together not only a way to manage a project, but more importantly a way to lead a team of people!  I think being a servant leader to the team and providing them the necessary resources to be at their peak effectiveness is a trait of a good leader.  It&#x27;s actually kind of amazing all the different ways even very smart people can get &quot;stuck&quot; - distracted by a less important task that is shiny and interesting, slog through hours of debugging to resolve an issue that someone else on the team could have helped them with, not communicating with other team members that they can&#x27;t get their part done unless another has provided them something first.  From experience, just helping people identify these blockers and get the team unstuck has been a big win.<p>I think tools absolutely are a big help too.  I&#x27;ve used sticky notes on whiteboards and it&#x27;s good for small teams that are co-located.  It breaks down for distributed teams.  We just started using JIRA and it is surprisingly good at helping us managing all of our work which would grow unwieldy using more primitive methods.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about the agile manifesto.  I guess it has its historic place as a reaction against the poor waterfall practices of the past and paved the way for new methods to emerge.  Besides that, it seems a bit dated and hasn&#x27;t served a useful practical purpose for me.",1394534900

7378433,comment,7377798,7378188,8,0,Spearchucker,,,"<i>You can&#x27;t blindly follow a plan, process, or ideal</i><p>You can. The question that you might ask is whether the plan is good or not.<p><i>You can&#x27;t follow dogma</i><p>As above. Dogma actually has its uses. The trick is knowing how, where and when to use it, or someone who is dogmatic. Machiavellian, but its a tool nonetheless.<p>Saying we don&#x27;t need a plan is to thumb our nose at thousands of years of wisdom. Sun Tzu was not stupid when he suggested choosing a path only once the objective and environment are understood. Stephen Covey puts the same concept into modern terms when he suggests beginning with the end in mind.<p>And that brings us to the disconnect we live in. Developing something using agile practices does not require a plan. A plan is however required at a level above the developer to steer development. As you go, you&#x27;ll find yourself becoming interested in that plan more and more. It&#x27;s a natural shift because the plan reflects the strategy, development is purely tactical. Understanding the strategy is motivational - it answers the why. Development is all about the how.<p>Real value as a developer only comes from experience. An experienced developer is successful <i>in spite</i> of any methodology, approach or framework, not because of it. Something else we&#x27;re really good at blinding ourselves to.<p>Experience has no price. It amuses me to no end that we as an industry place higher value on the 20-something hacker than we do on the 50-something veteran. We&#x27;re unintentionally letting culture hobble our chances of success.",1394534674

7378352,comment,7373038,7375201,3,0,einhverfr,,,"> Actually there have been studies that have shown that while more money doesn&#x27;t provide happiness, enough money is a pre-requisite. We&#x27;re not talking a ton, we&#x27;re talking enough to pay for food, shelter, and some basic form of entertainment.<p>True, but the amount of money required for this is not much.  If you aren&#x27;t picky where, and you have neough saved up to buy a house, you might be able to get by relatively well on $3000 a year in some parts of the world.<p>> Have you started a retail business?<p>I have helped.<p>Part of what you are talking about though is the cost in a more complex society of doing this.  Now a bakery is not necessarily a retail business primarily.  The most successful bakeries I know do both retail and wholesale baking.  I think it would be impossible to get by really on only one side.  People who want to buy your bread will come by, but you do not want to make everyone come to your store just to buy a loaf of bread.  You have to get it in other stores.<p>So I don&#x27;t think it is fair to call it just a retail business.<p>> However painting it with the rose-tinted glasses of &quot;You get to interact with more people, get involved in your community, and people can taste the results of your work.&quot; belies the actual hard work that building a business is.<p>I think what you are missing though is that both programming and baking are ultimately about creatively making something.  I don&#x27;t mean just artistically.  I mean it is about craft and seeing things come to life in your hands.  Part of the question is who you answer to and how deep your hands are in it physically.<p>So no I don&#x27;t see it as stupid to open up a bakery.  As with any business you need to do your planning first, prepare for an extended period without profit, etc going in (and have capital investment of your own to make it work).",1394532952
