BUT, i think your assumption that a lack of mistreatment of minorities results from a more diverse police force is naive.  in my experience, i have seen abuse against ethnic minorities at the hands of police who are themselves ethnic minorities - sometimes even the same ethnicity as the victim.  perhaps in many cases police brutality falls along racial lines, but only by correlation.  i think it is probably more of an issue of class, and groupings like &quot;people who look like thugs to me&quot;.  either way, as a professional-looking white or asian dude, you can usually escape being classed as a &quot;thug&quot; sight-unseen just for your appearance.<p>i would also offer that due to the fact you&#x27;re a successful guy, you have probably not had police interactions in, say, east new york.  police attitudes and behavior are highly variable based on where they work.  if you&#x27;re in a shitty neighborhood, you will have much worse interactions with cops no matter your race.  in nice neighborhoods, cops are nice.",1393822571

7332097,comment,7330664,7331942,2,0,cdoxsey,,,"Deciding how to educate their children is part of their religion. If you tell them &quot;you must send your children to a public school&quot; you are limiting their ability to practice their religion.<p>And this isn&#x27;t just an ad-hoc excuse... this has been true for a long time. For example the puritans in this country highly valued public education. They thought all children should know how to read so that they could read and understand the Bible (a direct consequence of their sola scriptura reformation roots).<p>So suppose you come from that background (like many Reformed and Evangelical Christians today), and the top priority in the education of your children is that they know the Bible: &quot;The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom&quot; and all that.<p>Well children won&#x27;t be getting that in a public school in America. And more than that the social institutions in this country (at all levels) are dead-set opposed to those kinds of traditional religious doctrines. (parents might point to things like evolution, sexual education, etc..)<p>Now I understand that from a secular perspective this looks ridiculous. That line of reasoning isn&#x27;t even something I would necessarily agree with. All I&#x27;m advocating here is a bit of tolerance as well as a little bit of knowledge about your fellow citizens. The very type of people who are predisposed to bypass the public school system for religious reasons, are also the type of people who won&#x27;t bow to government pressure. You&#x27;ll have to lock them up and take their children away from them before they&#x27;ll stop. (There is abundant historical precedent for this)<p>As to your point about Catholic schools... do you think that a Catholic school ought to be a place where other religious teaching is tolerated? Do you think such a school ought to be required to teach Islam or Protestantism for example? Or, to take a popular topic at the moment, should a church be required to perform same-sex marriages?<p>That seems like a very strange definition of tolerance to me... Catholic schools ought to teach Catholicism, and because the government doesn&#x27;t require you to send your children to that school you have the freedom to educate your children how you see fit.<p>Yes that means parents will sometimes choose badly and children will suffer because of it. But that&#x27;s the price we pay for living in a free society.",1393822076

NGP VAN prides itself on being a progressive and open-minded workplace; we have a fun and relaxed company culture, including blowing off steam on a softball field, drinking in the office on Fridays, enjoying periodic company retreats to warm places with beaches, and casual Friday every day.<p>Some relevant links:<p>Job Postings:<p><a href=""http://www.ngpvan.com/about/jobs/senior-developer-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ngpvan.com/about/jobs/senior-developer-0</a><p><a href=""http://www.ngpvan.com/about/jobs/development-intern"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ngpvan.com/about/jobs/development-intern</a><p><a href=""http://www.ngpvan.com/about/jobs/qa-automation-engineer-0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ngpvan.com/about/jobs/qa-automation-engineer-0</a><p>Coderwall: \n<a href=""https://coderwall.com/team/ngp-van"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coderwall.com/team/ngp-van</a><p>Hit me up at dmiller at ngpvan dot com if you have any questions!",1393821284

You are including recycling, so real production is about half of what you wrote.<p>The trouble is that at current rates of consumption the world will run out in 42 years (according to wikipedia). So this project would use 20% of all the remaining lead in the world. (Well not really, the film is not 100% lead, but it&#x27;s still quite a lot.)<p>I call that &quot;not enough&quot;. Although it might be worth it anyway. But what do you do when energy use goes up?<p>And despite people saying there is bromine and iodine in the ocean, there is no practical way to get it <i>out</i> of the ocean in quantity. There is <i>everything</i> in the ocean - in huge quantities! For example 1/10 as much gold as has ever been mined by humans exists in the ocean - but no one can get it out in quantity.<p>World production of iodine is about 1/200 of lead production and we already see that we barely have enough lead.<p>And world <i>existence</i> of iodine is 1/100 of lead. And considering we need a significant percentage of the lead in the world, there is no way there is enough iodine.<p>But we are ignoring the substrate. It won&#x27;t be so thin, so we&#x27;ll need a lot of it. I wonder how much of it is for mechanical strength (i.e. replaceable) and how much is essential.<p>Maybe this could work - using a thin film is very promising, but I&#x27;m skeptical this could be scaled.",1393821178

We got a great response on this back in January and now we are expanding.... So here is an updated version now that we are a team of two hiring.<p>Hey, HN. One of you is perfect for this idea.<p>We are two serial entrepreneurs currently trapped in the professions of being a freelance contractor. We have relatively stable 40 hour a week projects, and incoming projects as well that I generally can&#x27;t take due to lack of resources (time, the most precious one)<p>So here&#x27;s the idea.\nYou. Are interesting and have some experience in coding (webapps, mobile, whatever) would be a coding apprentice.\nI would give you a guaranteed 20 hour a week gig for now, and flex additional work as it comes in and you are available.\n(also now looking for 40 hours)<p>You would work on entrepreneurial ideas and contracts and get paid for doing so. If something took off the ground we could negotiate revenue/equity, but no matter what you will be getting paid.<p>Here is what you get.\nMoney\nFreedom and Flexibility (need the day off to deal with a hangover because you are in college and its friday?)\nReal World Education\nAbility to become a killer coder\nand whatever else. we are pretty flexible<p>Languages?\nPython/Ruby Obj-C Javascript(Node)\nYou name it.\nIf you can show competency in some language we currently do, then we can work together and you can get paid to learn and become an expert at any other languages as required.<p>About us, your &#x27;bosses&#x27;.\nBoss #1 (Portland Office)\nEarly 30s. Built several large-scale enterprise applications used by Fortune 500 companies. Lead engineering and product for a VC-funded healthcare startup. Last company built infrastructure that stored over 1 billion objects and transferred hundreds thousand objects per day.<p>Currently living in PDX (Inner SE) and renting a space at a co-working facility. Open to having you work here, or at my house. I prefer day hours, 10-6pm PST, but I am flexible.<p>Boss #2 (New York Office)\nLate 20s. Been in and out of various startups. Started ideas from scratch. Reasonably connected in the &#x27;valley&#x27;. No stranger to a term sheet. I have done hiring for a YC company.  Been on both the business and engineering side of places.<p>Currently living in NYC (manhattan) with enough room for you to come clock hours, but you can be remote as well, or both.\nI have been travelling a lot because it means that working 9-5 EST is a much more reasonable 12-8 or even sometimes 9pm - 5am.<p>I like tinkering with OSS and hardware too, obsessed with gadgets.<p>==============\ntl;dr\nLong story short, you will get paid to learn how to code in the real world, become an entrepreneur or freelancer (or both) and then hopefully be able to repeat this process.<p>You&#x27;ll get hands on attention and code reviews without some PM breathing down your neck. (unless you are working on a project that requires it).<p>We&#x27;ll figure out a good hourly rate, and when you are working on a project that is paid, probably double it. And then fall back to the normal rate when we are working on whatever random ideas I want to incubate.<p>email hn0314@boun.cr with a little bit about yourself, a resume if you have it, and most importantly either a github or code sample.",1393820577

While that may be expected in the world of sales, to people like us, it is a mortal insult.<p>While you might have good reasons, in your own opinion, to do it, you should be aware that your sensible business practice is making your product hate you.<p>I won&#x27;t waste my time on recruiters that won&#x27;t tell me the company name for a few reasons:<p>1. The recruiter that expects me to screw them by cutting them out of the loop is probably projecting--they screw candidates so often they think that no one has any integrity.<p>2. I hate recruiters and think I can get a better rate without one.  The one time I actually got an offer with a recruiter involved, it was for 60% what I was currently making at another job.  I rejected it on the spot, and the CEO said the offer was low because they would have to pay the recruiter based on what they paid me.<p>3. A company that doesn&#x27;t want anyone to know they are hiring should be getting cold calls from psychiatrists, not just recruiters.<p>But really, the only reason I need involves trust.
