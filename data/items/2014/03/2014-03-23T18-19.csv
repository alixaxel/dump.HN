That&#x27;s great, I guess, but there&#x27;s nothing particularly <i>technical</i> about it. They&#x27;re not using tech in some unusual or interesting way to cut down on delivery costs, or make bread in a different way, or anything.

(It looks like there&#x27;s a mobile app to come, but if all it does is show you a menu and let you order it would fall roughly into the same category. Table stakes.)<p>I was talking with a relative of mine who&#x27;s been in the grocery business for decades over the holidays last year, and we were joking around about how it wouldn&#x27;t be long until someone started touting home milk delivery -- something that was commonplace before most homes had TV sets, or even radios, much less computers -- as a &quot;tech startup.&quot; This isn&#x27;t <i>that,</i> of course.

And we are not talking nickels and dimes - up to 2% of payment.<p>Yes and no. You are saving the hospital on their readmission penalties, but those currently only apply for three conditions (CHF is one of them). Furthermore, the penalties are not always enough to cover the increased revenue that the hospital gets from the readmission - in other words, some hospitals may actually make a profit from the readmission even when the penalty is factored in.<p>Also, the &quot;up to 2%&quot; is itself complicated. Because of the way the penalty is deducted, other seemingly-unrelated factors (like the patient and insurance demographics of the hospital) have a huge impact on how large the penalty is, even holding everything else constant.<p>>  Hospitals can and should be charged for this<p>Currently, even the hospitals that receive the highest readmission penalties are not willing or able to pay (much) money for reducing readmissions. The way their budgets are structured doesn&#x27;t really allow for this[0].<p>I say this from experience - my startup also creates a product that happens to reduce readmissions (though this is not our primary goal), and one of the reasons that we emphasize our other (larger) benefits for the hospitals is that most hospitals just won&#x27;t pay much for a product that reduces readmissions.<p>On top of that, it&#x27;s also a <i>very</i> crowded space.

And we are not talking nickels and dimes - up to 2% of payment. It is also the hospitals responsibility to provide good patient education, as that will have an impact on patient satisfaction scores, and presumably bring more patients in the door. 
There are companies which do some of this, such as provide the patients with tablets to take home for 30 days. Hospitals can and should be charged for this, and since there is a clear business model here, I&#x27;m just curious as to why run this as a non-profit.
