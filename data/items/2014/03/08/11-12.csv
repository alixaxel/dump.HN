7364957,comment,7364719,7364904,4,0,tjohns,,,"Many modern planes do have satellite uplinks, but they&#x27;re mostly used for sending short text messages. Primary voice communications are still over VHF or HF radio. If you&#x27;re having a mechanical problem, the pilot is going to be more focused on not crashing than composing an email.<p>(There are some automated logs that are sent too -- and these were actually used as part of the Air France investigation -- but this is primarily for maintenance rather than real-time tracking.)<p>Even ignoring fancy telemetry systems, planes are normally equipped with an emergency transponder (ELT) which activates if there&#x27;s a sudden impact.<p>That signal would normally be detected by a Cospas-Sarsat satellite within 1-2 hours. In this case, it&#x27;s possible that the transponder didn&#x27;t activate, or the signal is too weak to be detected due to being underwater.",1394279849

Our business model is based on two things we know:<p>1) Communities already create transactions and revenue as a by-product of conversations and engagement<p>2) The majority of forums never break even and are a cost-centre<p>When looking at which problems forum owners want solving, aside from the technical things (installing, updating, security, backup, configuration), and the social things (engagement, search, features, schisms, moderation and permissions), the recurring concern is that forums seldom to never pay for themselves.<p>The thing we&#x27;re fixing with our business model is just that... how to make a forum financially viable to the site admin and the users.<p>We do this predominantly by pushing down the costs by having a platform with efficient software and design.<p>But we also do it by recognising that solving some of the problems &quot;Our community wants events but right now they&#x27;re on Facebook, EventBrite, Meetup and Google Calendar&quot; helps to return some of the externalised transactions back to where the community is.<p>We plan to charge service fees, as per eBay or Meetup, for things like selling tickets to events, or for helping to handle payments for classifieds.<p>No user of a forum that isn&#x27;t selling something is going to be paying, and nor are you as the site admin (except the low flat-rate fee for owning the site).<p>But we will add features to help bring more transactions back into the community and where others (you or your users) make money from those we&#x27;ll charge service fees for facilitating them.<p>It&#x27;s the difference between pushing down the costs aggressively and helping forums make money through transactions, that is where we believe our actual revenue will be. We really think that by entangling our success with your success means that we have to make the right product for the forum users and forum admins. We can&#x27;t just sell you hosting and walk away from you... we have to make sure every user is happy and your engagement stays high... we need to make sure the UX is awesome.<p>On the legal docs, we asked our lawyers to draft three documents that help protect site admins from various things: <a href=""https://github.com/microcosm-cc/legal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/microcosm-cc/legal</a><p>Namely, we&#x27;ve designed the documents to work with sites that have reactive moderation to ensure that the site admin isn&#x27;t liable for defamation, slander, fraud by users, bullying, etc.<p>This is going way further than other forums with just a COPPA doc and a template privacy policy, we&#x27;ve looked at the risks a forum admin is exposed to and specifically are addressing those. We are protecting our customers, not just us. Though our ability to do this is limited, you can choose to apply your own legal terms and remove any protection our documents offer you.<p>On pagination, we&#x27;ve design it with infinite scroll in mind. All UX feedback to date has preferred pages so that is what we&#x27;ve gone with.

The minimalism is by-design on Microcosm, users like their own expression but not necessarily that of others. Humans are great like that. We&#x27;ve chosen to keep the content clean, the conversations and events, but to allow a comment area on the profile page where literally anything can be inserted. So far, it&#x27;s the best balance we&#x27;ve found for this, but it will be revisited when we have a wider diversity of interests covered by the forums we host... it will give us a better understanding of how people in different interest verticals want to express and distinguish themselves.<p>Events is just the first of the structured types of content that will be in a forum. We hope to make the other types as good as we&#x27;ve made our first-bash of the event type. Though we have to solve recurring events first.<p>Thanks for all the feedback, and let me know what you think about that first set of things re: service fees and our business model. It&#x27;s definitely something that has raised questions, we know we are not the right product for the top few % of forums in the world, but we&#x27;ve received a lot of very enthusiastic feedback from mid-sized forums that have between 50 and 500 peak concurrent users that this is something they love about us.",1394277317

Moreover, organic chemistry actually means &quot;carbon based&quot; rather than &quot;life based&quot;. Many of these carbon bases molecules are built also by inorganic means in other words and in deep space. It&#x27;s possible to make some complex molecules with boron and nitrogen, but most of them are not stable enough to bet your life on them.<p>Other main detail is that you need some very energetic reactions, like combining the hydrogen in a molecule with oxygen to produce water. (The smaller example is CH4 + 2<i>O2 -> CO2 + 2</i>H2O, but methane is not easy to store, so most of the time earths life depend on the combustion of more complex molecules like sugars of fatty acids.) It&#x27;s a matter using oxidations and reductions to obtain energy in a weight efficient way. Oxygen is easy to distribute, big organic molecules are easy to store and use in chemical reactions in controlled setting.<p>So if you want to find whales, look for oxygen. In Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is easy to find some strange non equilibrium mixing of oxygen from plants and methane from cows. (In any case, most of the oxygen and methane on Earth is probably produced by bacteria.) If you are really pessimistic, look for any anomalies in the spectrum.<p>I checked Wikipedia <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)#Potential_for_extraterrestrial_life"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)#Potential_for_ext...</a>  . The article says that there are oxygen molecules in Europa! Mostly produced by the decomposition of water by the Sun&#x27;s radiation. Someone estimated that the concentration of oxygen in water is enough to support fish equivalents, but it&#x27;s an estimation not a measurement, and estimation are usually optimistic.",1394277272

They are confirming that the quotes were accurate. <i>But Dorian Nakamoto has already confirmed that he was quoted accurately</i>. He said that he misunderstood her and she apparently misunderstood him, and that seems entirely possible.<p>Her entire story relies on the confused &#x27;admission&#x27; from Dorian Nakamoto during a few minutes interaction.
