Also occurring in some cases, and somewhat related, is working out of a &#x27;satellite&#x27; office rather than one of the major offices of a particular country. I&#x27;m surprised that more tech companies do not allow or encourage such arrangements. The arguments in favor of generally prohibiting remote working strike me as rather flimsy.",1393793994

Valuable – certainly, but a new technology whose crowning achievement so far is facilitating crime has a big PR problem. And that&#x27;s not Bitcoin&#x27;s only PR problem. Its association with wingnut (hacker-)libertarianism is another ball and chain, which gives Bitcoin the good old Glen Beck treatment.<p>I think Bitcoin adopters should market it as a terrific way to spend small amounts of cash online. Unfortunately, Bitcoin&#x27;s volatility doesn&#x27;t help to make this case, so that is probably the first thing that should be addressed. Bitcoin supporters should understand one thing: uncontrolled volatility, even when it&#x27;s pointing up, perhaps <i>especially</i> when it&#x27;s pointing up, isn&#x27;t a good sign.
