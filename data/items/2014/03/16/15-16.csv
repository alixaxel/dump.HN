People who buy ads, or free search users?<p>(an aside) One of the startups I worked for years ago, rented a huge office near San Jose, but decided to change directions and hire out of cheaper locales for a while. So we sublet the space out. For a good 2 years this space generated more revenue than the rest of the company and we joked that perhaps we should get into the real estate business. We even had two employees with real estate licenses in 3 states.",1394985577

This, flanked by threats to everybody that would voice criticism towards her makes for a very bad situation. She received responsibility for a team with a task that would be enough for a seasoned manager and she failed hard - not because she was stupid, but because she never had a chance.

7409848,comment,7409611,7409611,1,0,hosh,,,"&quot;Contrary to what we would like to believe, there is no such thing as a “structureless” group. Any group of people of whatever nature that comes together for any length of time for any purpose will inevitably structure itself in some fashion. &quot;<p>This assertion is not quite true.<p>When I think of &quot;structure&quot;, I am thinking of deliberate, conscious, and rational attempts to create a sort of rigid ... structure. What he is describing is better termed as &quot;dynamic&quot;.<p>I make this distinction because I&#x27;ve typically found (as a man), men tends to think and work with structures more often than with the dynamics... the natural ebb and flow of a group without a &quot;structure&quot;.<p>When you start thinking about accomplishing a goal (whether a man or a woman) as a group, you start talking about structure, or &quot;process&quot; or any number of those words. That&#x27;s when you use a particular part of the consciousness to <i>drive</i> and coordinate efforts. So when you start trying to look at what the group can <i>do</i>, accomplish, or its utility, you naturally start looking at structure, and perhaps even imposing structure.<p>Dynamics, or flow will happen regardless of whether we consciously attempt to structure the group or not. When you&#x27;re not aiming for a particular goal, you can simply just <i>be</i> with the group, to feel and experience the way the group comes together and disperses.  There is great wisdom in this, something that has been obscured because it doesn&#x27;t produce anything that can be easily quantified.<p>I know programmers have talked about &quot;flow&quot; or &quot;zone&quot;, about teams that have &quot;gelled&quot;. These are all related to the wisdom of being, rather than that of doing. &quot;Flow state&quot;, or &quot;zone&quot; is that sweet spot where your effort becomes effortless because you&#x27;ve relaxed into the flow while ... flowing to the goal. Flow states are one of the experiences we can have with consciousness, and you get there by first relaxing and getting more in touch with being ... and dropping some of your fixation on structure.<p>In truth, you see this play between structure and dynamic, between effort and flow. It&#x27;s just that, most of us are so fixated on the doing and the structure, we are no longer aware of the natural dynamic. This is something I&#x27;ve noticed many (not all) women naturally understand this, and generally, men are pretty clueless about. When men typically encounter this, men will argue about it until we are blue in the face; usually, the women will agree, thus reinforcing this fixation. Women&#x27;s liberation, in my opinion, is less about liberating women, and more about whacking men with a clue-by-four.",1394985124

While this probably can&#x27;t be as economically efficient as dynamic pricing in the short run, in the long run, it could be better for their branding.

7409798,comment,7408055,7408055,23,0,dylanrw,,,"Based on this article I see a few things, and some alarming ones that make me question the source. Also, hopefully to prevent me from sounding like too much of an ass, I&#x27;ll use the following as the definition of sexism: &quot;Sexism or gender discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a person&#x27;s sex or gender.&quot;<p>- The wife situation: Awkward/horrible. Either the wife is crazy with jealousy issues or we&#x27;re missing a portion of the story. Presuming this is the entirety of the facts, I think it&#x27;s plain that the woman isn&#x27;t going around approaching male colleagues of the founder and harassing them. So I guess she&#x27;s acting this way due to the JAH&#x27;s sex, but it just sounds like a boundary issue to me rather than rote sexism. I&#x27;m surprised policy doesn&#x27;t exist to prevent this sort of thing inside GH.<p>- Rebuffed advances being handled poorly. I&#x27;m surprised that she&#x27;s surprised by this, she&#x27;s dating a coworker, she&#x27;s introduced the concept of coworkers being viable dating options. Yes I&#x27;m sure she was approached because she&#x27;s female, heterosexual males will do this. Male or female. Of course the person was disrespectful for approaching even if she was in a relationship, people will be clueless/rude, whether they work with you or not. The passive aggressive reverts, and the lack of power to abate them sounds like a lack of leverage on her part, and while she may chalk the entire thing up to her lack of pull due to being female, I see this as a symptom of the cabal syndrome you often see in self managed companies.<p>- I think it&#x27;s obvious that she&#x27;s sensitive to sexist issues, even on the side of seeing it in places where it may not exist. There are even a few cases where she could even be exhibiting the behavior herself ie: Not talking to the hula-hoopers themselves (why are not capable of defending themselves?), claiming the men present were gawking (but not mentioning any other spectators), &quot;always looking to meet women I can look up to.&quot; (I&#x27;d be seen as an ass by many if I looked for &quot;men to look up to&quot;), &quot;confused and insulted to think that a woman who was not employed by my company was pulling the strings&quot; what does the fact that she&#x27;s a woman have to do with it? (This is a stretch I know but every time someone is mentioned their sex is brought up, why?)<p>- The real major theme I see is, &quot;I was treated poorly.&quot; Yes this happens, just not always to a highly public, touchy social subject-matter expert in this field, who then releases the story to the press (vendetta much?).<p>It&#x27;s a shame that theres dirt in the garden of Github, shockingly it&#x27;s a real company run by real people. I&#x27;d carry on with making great software; always try and make sure I&#x27;m not putting up barriers (intentional or otherwise) to the entry of the just as capable minorities in this field; always strive to see the difference between true injustice and someone&#x27;s poor decisions, their sensitivities, and a really messed up corporate experience.",1394984469

These designs have been passively safe as of twenty years ago when they were pioneered by the integral fast reactor. The plant can lose all power and will not ever melt down; liquid metal reactors just don&#x27;t work that way.<p>One of the key advantages that recommends fourth generation nuclear reactor technology is that the design eliminates much of the existing &quot;waste&quot; (it&#x27;s really just ~$50T worth of unspent fuel we have laying around that could power the entire world for ~1000 years) that&#x27;s been produced by past and current light water reactors. A better estimate would be in the 200 to 400 year range now. That&#x27;s right; we&#x27;re actually capable of getting rid of nuclear waste with nuclear reactors.<p>Yes that&#x27;s still a good number of years, but estimates for global deaths per year caused just by particulate pollution from coal power plants range from a conservative 100,000 up to 3,000,000. How many people per year is nuclear currently killing? I was pretty incredulous to find this out, but the answer is zero. And given that they produce negligible CO2 as compared with fossil fuels, they are recommended by the climatologist who is largely responsible for drawing attention to climate change since the 1980s, James Hansen. The conclusion (begins on page 116 of this .rtf file) in his 2009 book is worth reading:<p><a href=""http://ge.tt/5GTotjQ1/v/0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ge.tt/5GTotjQ1/v/0</a><p>Ironically, traditional environmentalist movements that indiscriminately protested and continue to protest against any nuclear power technologies have effectively greenwashed the &quot;clean coal&quot; (wtf) mantra into existence because fossil fuel plants are the only other alternative for baseload. To me, this seems eerily similar to the protestation of tobacco companies that their products were causing cancer. We&#x27;re still building coal power plants, but the CO2 sequestration they&#x27;re currently talking about would require burning ~25% more coal to power the process, making it so uneconomical that it won&#x27;t ever happen.<p>And since sodium-cooled fast reactors can also run on decommissioned nuclear weapons, decreasing the risk of nuclear proliferation, we have every reason to be using these technologies for baseload power and zero reasons not to. Given the choice, I&#x27;d rather live near a nuclear power plant than any other type. Perhaps I&#x27;d finally be able to get an electric car that would then be functionally carbon neutral, though maybe not avoiding the ecological damage externalized in the building such massive batteries.

Linux is for VMs.  I run vanilla Windows as my boot OS and then use Linux from within a VM, thus getting the benefits of Windows hardware compatibility where I need it.  This lets me do things like run nine monitors when my laptop is docked by chaining DisplayLink adapters.  Note that Windows with DisplayLink will only support eight monitors so for the ninth I bind the DisplayLink adapter to the VM for dual monitors with my Linux VM.  Going above more than two monitors with a Linux host OS is akin to beating one&#x27;s head into a wall, especially if you move between monitor configurations often, but just works in Windows.<p>Thus far, with the ability for the VM to bind specific hardware directly and not shared via the host OS I get all the benefits of a Linux host OS without the hassle of broken driver implementations taking me down for long stretches at a time.  As an example, I can bind my ALFA WiFi adapter directly to the Linux VM and run aircrack-ng all day long.<p>Yes, there are drawbacks.  You will need a bigger hard-drive (best if you can fit two in your laptop) and more memory, but those are cheap these days.  The benefits, however are massive.

Last thing you want is buried 2&#x27;s.<p>Once your numbers start getting high, I think it makes sense to use the front two rows exclusively for 2&#x27;s, 4&#x27;s, and the occasional 8, but to shift 8&#x27;s to the third row as soon as possible.<p>I&#x27;ve found that to actually finish once you have all the pieces you need, it may make sense to break script, but if you want to go on to try to make 4096, you may want to carefully stay on script.<p>I&#x27;ve found that in tricky situations when I want to combine large value pieces that are just not in alignment, it makes sense to try to slide lower value pieces under one to &quot;boost&quot; one of the others into alignment. The ability to do this makes it valuable to keep your combining pieces in the middle of the board.<p>Lastly, when you have multiple possible moves, make the move that takes most advantage of the piece that&#x27;s about to appear, either because you can quickly combine the new piece or because it can &quot;boost&quot; another piece into alignment.<p>Follow this advice, and you will be a star!",1394983343

But OS X doesn&#x27;t have driver (thus hardware) support for all (or even a large range of) hardware that conform to the architecture.

Apple also goes so far as to actively try to prevent OS X running on non-Mac hardware[0].
