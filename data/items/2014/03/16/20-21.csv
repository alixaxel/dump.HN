7411250,comment,7408807,7410413,4,0,vilhelm_s,,,"I don&#x27;t know how you develop Lisp, but one style which seems encouraged by environments like SLIME is this: You write your file in emacs, and each time you finish a function definition you hit the &quot;send definition to repl&quot; keystroke, and then experiment a bit in the repl to see that you got it right.<p>If you do things this way, the state of the running lisp interpreter depends on the entire history of the coding session. Each time you add a new definition, you mutate the interpreter&#x27;s memory. There is no guarantee that the current state matches what you would have if you recompiled the entire system from scratch.<p>On the other hand, the usual style in Haskell development is that you write a function definition and then hit the &quot;reload&quot; key combination, and this makes the state of the repl exactly the match the contents of the file. It throws away the results of any commands you ran in the repl in the meantime.<p>(This seems like an interesting cultural difference, something like &quot;Haskell/ML/Java/Scheme programmers think of a program as a text, Common Lisp/Smalltalk programmers think of a program as an OS process&quot;).",1395003527

There have been lawsuits out there claiming that someone&#x27;s Soybean field had been 100% contaminated by Monsanto seeds, so that the fact that all the plants survived Roundup plantings was completely accidental. Given how difficult it is to even cross soybeans on purpose, having an entire field of plants with perfect flowers that get contaminated through pollination is just silly.<p>On something like corn, however, you just can&#x27;t avoid cross contamination. So if a field has corn that has genes that came straight from a GMO, it&#x27;s not as if one can prove wrongdoing: It&#x27;s impossible to prevent that kind of contamination.<p>Ultimately though, we just have to figure out if we believe that patenting GMOs is something that is good for society or not. If I make a computer program and sell it, it&#x27;s not really all that difficult for me to make money out of it, if people actually want it. If I tried to sell carefully engineered soybean seeds, I would not make much money, because from a few soybeans you can make millions. In two seasons, anyone that bought the seed could just compete with me without any for the R&D cost. So if a world without some kind of protection, major seed research just have to be left to public projects that don&#x27;t expect any profit. You can&#x27;t even protect your seed by being the only user, because very often, the seed itself is the output. Good luck selling soybeans without giving away the DNA to make more.<p>And it&#x27;s not like we could instead change the protections to be all about the insertion of new DNA into a plant: The entire corn catalogue of Roundup ready seeds is probably comes from less than two dozen actual insertions of foreign DNA into regular plants. The tough work is to figure out which ones are actually effective, and to cross them with high yielding regular plants. So I could just take the gene that Monsanto put on a seed and add it to my own strain by using conventional breeding techniques in about 5 years, tops.<p>So yeah, our options are to just stop all research, move it all to non-profits, or allow some kind of patents on seeds. You could make a case for either of the three, but we have to understand that they all have their shortcomings.",1395001529

However if GOOG wants to facilitate the transfer of the company of GTTP, it&#x27;d continue to operate at extreme loss by transferring more money to GTTP via Adwords loss until the shares goes down minimally $0.001 on OTC market (a la LEH). Then GTTP can acquire a worthless asset.<p>b) Adwords is generating a net profit more than the payout to GTTP. Net profit not in terms of net income but in the sense that the profit/intangible valuation of Google&#x27;s use of revenue from GTTP&#x27;s generated ads to build out infrastructure and human resources. GTTP&#x27;s activity will then boost the shares of GOOG, given that GTTP generate a fixed amount of money for GOOG; using discount cashflow model, that means whatever GTTP&#x27;s income cannot outpace the GTTP-GOOG Adwords unit&#x27;s constantly rising valuation. (Think of this using a shareholder&#x27;s dividend to cannibalize the company; or using a child&#x27;s allowance to buy his/her parent).<p>c) Adwords is generating a net profit but less than the payout to GTTP. Basically a company distributing the bulk of its net profit to shareholders as dividend than using it to reinvest in R&D/infrastructure. In practice, GTTP&#x27;s internal shareholders would likely revolt given GOOG&#x27;s business model of growth (vs. say sleepier industries such as utility). But let&#x27;s suppose say for the sake of the argument, that GTTP shareholders are agreement to cannibalize GOOG, they can do it! Given that the accumulated annual income generated by GTTP outpaces the market valuation of GOOG. (Think of WhatsApp founders cash out of 16B of FB stock or Mark Cuban with Broadcast.com at the height of YHOO&#x27;s valuation, and the valuation of GOOG or FB decrease enough and/or they kept siphoning income to buy the company at a later time.)",1395001315

Pandoc is amazing, this appears to a weekend project.<p>Is Latex requiring processing power to generate PDFs that become professional publishing house books surprising?  Of course not.  Latex is sick.  I was a non-tech student in college, and when I discovered Latex in a CS class my mind was blow and loved it for a while, despite fucking up regularly with its learning curve.  (Funny anecdote: I even had a terrible philosophy professor in my liberal arts college senior year who went to Stanford and noticed he used Latex for everything, unlike any professor at my tech-illiterate school; he used it because his friend was this guy Donald Knuth; I kissed that guy&#x27;s ass for the rest of the semester after that tidbit just for stories about Knuth).  My point was scaling Latex in a server environment would be difficult, and I was addressing a few people equating this whole thing to Pandoc, which I did not find fair.  Running Latex concurrently for lots of people sounds rough to me, but then again I never implemeneted anything nearly as complicated as that.<p>Gitit does not just give you just a printable HTML page.  If you notice, gitit uses the Pandoc backend to export many formats.  It might not set them as printable, but to see gitit+pandoc in action, look at the export menu to the bottom left corner of the default them on the page you link.  You do not see the PDF format export, because as I mentioned in my original comment, by default Pandoc Latex+PDF support is not enabled because of said performance load.<p>I was speculating writing an equivalent of this service with Pandoc and Haskell is doable, but solely generating PDFs would be a load that might make it difficult at scale.  I do not know.  ShareLatex, who arguably is way ahead beyond my speculation because they implemented a powerful web-based Latex editor, did some very unorthodox (as far as just reloading Latex in the shell every time) architecture to make it fast and resilient.<p>I am not sure how to respond to the comment re Gitit and Pandoc.  Gitit is basically a wrapper around Pandoc, and it is merely a web interface to everything Pandoc does for different document formats, and hackage clearly lists it as a dependency with version 1.10+.[0]  I know they are not apple to apple comparison.  It was just a speculation. In the other post I was actually using Gitit and Pandoc interchangeably because the latter is the integral component of the former.<p>I feel there is a type checking joke lurking in my last line, but I am too tired to find it.<p>[0] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gitit-0.10.3.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/gitit-0.10.3.1</a>",1395000551

I also don&#x27;t think the assessment that there the current scenario which allows big rewards for R&D is a net win is crazy.<p>But overall there is a wider direction of change whether directed or emergent. Our agricultural system producing our food is becoming problematic in many ways. Food is flora and fauna. These things exist in an ecosystem. These controlled super strains can become very dominant and genetically poor. Many major crops are losing genetic diversity. GMO cereals are just a part of it. It&#x27;s been going on for a long time. Genetic modification is something we started doing hundreds of years before we named it. Modern genetic tech distills it.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the long term ramifications of all this can be captured in supply and demand. There is a bigger picture that is probably not going to be clear until it is in retrospect.",1395000401
