Specifically, point #7:<p><i>If there are any laws regulating businesses, you can assume larval startups will break most of them, because they don&#x27;t know what the laws are and don&#x27;t have time to find out.<p>For example, many startups in America begin in places where it&#x27;s not really legal to run a business. Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and Google were all run out of garages. Many more startups, including ours, were initially run out of apartments.

On top of that, they usually command lower pay than the domestic laborers in the same market, so this leaves them with very little in the way of spending money. They also work relentless hours, 7 days a week. So their life is basically wake, work, sleep with stops for meals 3 times a day.<p>There are more than just workers though, the women who come tend to end up in lower-end service jobs, house cleaners, cheap day care etc. And some of them have kids who are right now, very young and not in the job market (meaning no disposable income).<p>Both groups are well serviced by their local Mercado Latino and Walmart in terms of most needs and their children, if they&#x27;ve brought them here, are usually too young to want to shop at stylish mall shops.<p>If you look at the kinds of places that service the community, they aren&#x27;t high-end restaurants and retail shops offering comforts from home. It&#x27;s cheap fast food, pupusa shops, check cashing, cheap phone calls home etc. A visit to local pawn shops in and around Manassas will reveal shelf after shelf full of tools laborers have sold as they head back home after the housing bust, and are usually in shopping centers full of Spanish language shops. It&#x27;s very much a temporary laborer blue collar demographic.<p>I suspect this will change.

He&#x27;s just using modern design methods to emmulate old downtowns, as anachronistic as that may seem. But the style is just that. Style.<p>He does not build in places like Matteson, IL, for example because Lincoln Mall in Matteson is dying due to demographic trends (mostly white flight) and the thriving of another ...mall of the same - style - and vintage but with a shinny Apple store. Places like Matteson are unlucky because other malls in and around the Chicagoland are doing quite fine despite their tired, mid-century-gray motifs.<p>In places like Chicago where the weather is miserable most of the time winter and summer (IMHO), indoor malls still make a lot of sense.

Country flags (or any real-world-attached property of yourself), meanwhile, encourage hate and trolling.<p>Probably, the most obvious system would involve taking tripcodes, forcing the arbitrary-input-string to a numeric value one can increment (i.e. increment on each post where a &quot;Keep Identity&quot; checkbox isn&#x27;t enabled) so that everyone always has one but they can still change easily, and then adding the thread-ID to the hash so that they can&#x27;t be kept forever. And then visualizing them with something colorful, because when every post has a tripcode they become a mess of very-hard-to-track text.<p>Or, you know, hashed thread+user identicons, like I said.<p>> Your IP is your identity for moderation purposes. Not ideal, but an explicit goal is to never ever require logins.<p>You don&#x27;t need logins to have accounts. Use an <a href=""http://samy.pl/evercookie/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://samy.pl/evercookie/</a>, and generate an account for someone when you haven&#x27;t seen them before. Make unnamed accounts ephemeral (expire them after a year or so.) And make it so that if you enter just an email address, you get sent a link that--provided it&#x27;s opened under the same evercookie--merges the account it was opened in <i>and its history</i> into a named account.<p>Thus, the login flow looks like this:<p>1. go to 4chan, browse around, make posts;<p>2. decide you want to keep these posts;<p>3. enter your email address in the &quot;email&quot; field while making a post; now all the posts you made on this computer are attached to your account (but that doesn&#x27;t retroactively change the identicon they have in their threads) and you are logged into that account from then on.<p>4. somewhere else, using a new computer, repeat 1-3.<p>This makes it much simpler to ban miscreants, while still generally keeping things anonymous. The one problem with it is that you won&#x27;t be able to &quot;remove&quot; a 4chan identity from a (possibly public!) computer--but this can be handled by making <i>computer identities</i> separate from <i>user identities</i>, and allowing the &quot;user&quot; to log out while still remembering who the <i>computer</i> is.

So you cram in preparation, and then if you don&#x27;t pass the test, you plan to retake it in a year.<p>I&#x27;d think the best and brightest would be the ones whose working knowledge, without cramming, allows for innovative, interesting, clever solutions. Even better if you can get away from the artificial feeling of interviews, into a &quot;here&#x27;s an actual, and unsolved, problem, let&#x27;s figure out how to solve it together so I can see how you tick&quot;, rather than &quot;here&#x27;s a fake question, one with a well known, posted on the internet, solution, that if you ever faced in real life you&#x27;d solve in 5 minutes of Googling and move on, and which I expect you to recognize as a (X) problem, and regurgitate the solution from the selected readings&quot;. (That said, one or two stages of the interview seemed like they ~might~ be that).<p>Maybe the intent isn&#x27;t really to hire the best and brightest (that&#x27;s hard to test for), but really the people who want to work at Google the most; are you willing to devote hours to the mere possibility?",1395018314

Every slide it&#x27;s like he&#x27;s sneering down at you (the candidate), demanding you bow down before him, tell him all the right lies [1], and devote your life and every fiber of your person to pleasing him in just the right ways during and after the interview.<p>Candidates are real people with emotions and a right to dignity. Some of them are going to rock, some are going to be meh, and some will be terrible, but they all deserve a much greater degree of respect than this asshole is giving them. Interviewing, and advice for interviews should be about giving the candidate every opportunity to impress you, not tearing them down and demanding they prove their worth to you.<p>The saddest part is that due to today&#x27;s job market for most people, people are probably clamoring to work for this guy.

If your claim were true, people would refuse to invest in shares that don&#x27;t pay dividends.<p>The primary reason to invest in shares is that they they might grow along with the (a) market as a whole, and (b) the company that issued the shares. Dividends are frosting.<p>> So yes, people are precisely buying GOOG stock because they believe that at some point in the future, they will pay dividends.<p>With all respect, do you really want to be pontificating about something you know nothing about? There are plenty of companies that don&#x27;t pay dividends at all, never have, and yet have many loyal investors, for the best of reasons -- the company is growing along with the value of its stock. Instead of paying dividends, many companies put corporate profits directly back into company expenses, with the expectation that this will grow the company and its stock. And the investors agree.",1395018229

Any competent attorney understands how charges group under federal sentencing law; not only was he not facing a 30 year sentence, he <i>could not</i> face a 30 year sentence.<p>Swartz had competent legal representation from the jump. His counsel at the time of his suicide wrote in a postmortem on the case that he believed Swartz stood little chance of <i>any</i> custodial sentence, <i>even were he to be convicted</i>. It&#x27;s not hard to see why: the sentencing guidelines for first-time offenders of non-remunerative CFAA offenses aren&#x27;t very demanding.<p>Swartz was likely to be ruined by the cost of defending a complex federal charge, faced the prospect of potentially spending months in federal prison, and an overall likelihood of the whole incident concluding with a felony conviction on his record, which may have been problematic for his future endeavors.

Some of the things in this list might even prioritize bad candidates. &quot;Convince me you&#x27;ve wanted to work here your whole life?&quot; Unless you&#x27;re Apple or Google, no one has wanted to work at your company for even a few months and most of them probably hadn&#x27;t even heard of you until stumbling across your website or job board posting. What you are asking is for candidates to lie to you. Is that really what makes a good employee? I doubt it.<p>I think practices like these are way so many companies are filled to the brim with incompetent designers and engineers. If, for example, you&#x27;re looking to hire a software developer you should be way more concerned with the kind of code they write than with the quality of their handshake. Both are nice to have but only one is vital.<p>As a semi-recent graduate who has slightly more recently become employed, my advice to new grads out there is to take the advice in this presentation, it&#x27;s pretty accurate. My advice to the person who made this slideshow along with any other hiring managers who are currently nodding their heads in agreement: Unless you&#x27;re hiring car salesmen you need to seriously re-evaluate your practices because you are terrible at your job.",1395018046

I think probably the only groups with any say-so in the direction it grew were the Battlefield protectionist groups.<p>But all that was very much a product of the Western expansion of 66. Most of the older folks in the area remember when 66 didn&#x27;t come out that far and Manassas was just the 234/28 intersection and 28 East to Manassas Park.<p>When something <i>was</i> done, we end up with bizarreness like two entirely different roads called &quot;234&quot;, one that goes through the main strip of town, and the other that goes through countryside and bypasses the commercial center entirely...which no doubt hasn&#x27;t helped the commercial interests of that area at all.<p>I know from growing up out there that the anti-battlefield people put a really bad taste in lots of big commercial company&#x27;s mouths.
