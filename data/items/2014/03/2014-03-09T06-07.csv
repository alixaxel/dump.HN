At school we were taught Logo on BBC Micros, but we didnt have a BBC micro at home, so my dad sourced MSX Logo [1].<p>Unfortunately, it was localized in dutch, so instead of the &quot;forward&quot; command, there was the &quot;vooruit&quot; command. So to make it the same as we learned in school, my dad made a set of English functions which wrapped all the Dutch functions. He is an economist/diplomat, not a programmer, and it was quite a few years until I realized what he had done and how impressive that was.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.generation-msx.nl/software/philips/msx-logo/release/2568/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.generation-msx.nl/software/philips/msx-logo/relea...</a>",1394348355

So, not only are some of your old habits invalid, but the functionality has been replaced by something you would rather not use in the first place.<p>Adding insult to injury here is the fact that the main reason these changes were made in the first place was to get Windows users accustomed to the tablet interface, with the assumption that they would want to use the same OS on their tablet that they use on their desktop. It was to give Windows tablets a leg up in the market vs. iOS and Android devices; it doesn&#x27;t appear to have been based on a desire to simply improve the desktop users&#x27; experience.<p>I&#x27;m sure they also wanted to create a market for touchscreen Windows PCs too. There were probably some marketing people that were convinced that a touchscreen would simply be a standard thing that every PC had in the future. Who knows, it could still happen I guess. If it goes that way they may look like geniuses in 10 years. I&#x27;m skeptical though.",1394347996

Yes, short notice situations do happen, but most things are planned sufficiently in advance to reach out to a small, trusted group of local/locally available service providers.<p>While the on-demand dimension of a service like this is appealing in those rare instances where you have short notice to find someone and your usual options are booked, this feels intuitively like the minority of situations.",1394347532

While the Mig-31 (1981) was indeed engineered to make a real stand, and this article talks to that, I don&#x27;t think this article builds a case for or against anyone having any real idea whether the SR-71 (1966) was vulnerable to the Mig-25 or not. If the question is &quot;what repelled the SR71,&quot; the question isn&#x27;t the technical merits of the Mig-31, it&#x27;s the question of what was known v.s. unknown about what when.<p>The question of the Mig-25&#x27;s capabilities were answered more clearly after Viktor Belenko defected with one in 1976. It was not a threat. How long it took to figure that out, and American confidence that Viktor&#x27;s Mig-25 was as good as any other they&#x27;d likely see, remain unknown factors. The Mig-31 (1981) wasn&#x27;t really much faster, leading to the carefully coordinated chase described in the article, but it at least had an electronics suite, radar, communications link, and armaments capable of making it&#x27;s threat visibly apparent.<p>Certainly the Zaslon phased-array radar is impressive and the R-33 missile specs give it the on paper capabilities to hit a SR-71. Yet the article&#x27;s talks of only two events where an interception occurred, one undated, the second in 1986, after the first major upgrade to the Zaslon radar and the whole time using the very first Soviet in flight digital computer, acquiring targets for a 1970&#x27;s designed missile the R-33 (fielded 1981).",1394346796

7367690,comment,7365507,7366944,3,0,ganeumann,,,"So there&#x27;s a difference between teaching and motivating. A good teacher does both, of course, and not just with younger students. I think you&#x27;re thinking about the motivational aspects of criticizing the kids?<p>There&#x27;s a ton of research on how to motivate in the teaching environment. Some basics:<p>There&#x27;s a big difference between extrinsic motivation and intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic means you are doing something because someone if rewarding you for doing it/punishing you for not doing it. Intrinsic means you are doing it because you, yourself, want to do it. In a classroom, grades are extrinsic motivation, interest in the subject is intrinsic. Both motivations work while they are present. But studies show that when extrinsic motivation stops, so does learning. That is, someone may do very well in a class to get good grades, but when they are done with the class they will stop learning the subject (if all they were in it for were the grades.) In the military, boot-camp motivation works while the soldier is being yelled at, but as soon as the sergeant goes away, so does discipline. (Deci, Edward L. and Richard M. Ryan, _Intrinsic Motivation and Self-Determination in Human Behavior_.) The key to getting motivation right is how the person being motivated views the reward or punishment. Or, in systems terms, you get what you measure.<p>This reflects on the method in the article. If the kids were learning chess to impress the teacher, they would lose motivation when they are criticised. But if the kids are learning chess because they want to win, they gain motivation when they learn ways to make that happen. Motivation is important.<p>Generally, it&#x27;s better to be non-judgemental when offering a critique of students&#x27; work. I think she fails here a bit. But offering a critique is very important. If the critique is important, and the student wants to learn, then they focus on the content of the critique. The critique, also, has to be fair. If the critique is viewed as punishment, then the students might start attempting to please the teacher with theater. So if she called them lazy and they saw that as punishment for making moves too fast, they might engage in business-theater, making moves slower without thinking; this would allow them to avoid the punishment of being called lazy. But if she is correct in noting that they were, in fact, lazy, then they will recognize it as fair criticism and respond. (Kids are world-class judges of fairness, as all parents know.)<p>Also, students do much better (and are happier with) classes that demand high performance but allow them to work their way to success. (Clinchy, Blythe, &quot;Issues of Gender in Teaching and Learning&quot;, Jrnl of Excellence in College Teaching 1 (1990):52-67.) The important thing is that the students feel some control over their ability to do better. (Also why you should never tell your kid &quot;you are smart&quot;, this makes it sound like it&#x27;s something they <i>are</i>, not something they <i>do</i>; i.e. something they have no control over.)<p>I think if you read any decent book on pedagogy (my favorite is &quot;What the Best College Teachers Do&quot;, by Ken Bain) you&#x27;ll see that there is a huge amount of research on how kids learn and how they are motivated to learn. That most of this research seems mainly ignored in the real world is unfortunate.",1394346117

A good congressional district staffer could take this, write up a few letters &quot;from&quot; the Congressperson to whoever&#x27;s in charge of the person in charge of JPAC, send a release to the local cable channel, and get a pretty good local firestorm going on the issue to shame the DoD into some action.

District staffers live for things like this; take advantage of it.<p>Pro tip if you have something where you&#x27;re going to use this strategy: make it as easy and as obvious as possible what you&#x27;d like your representative to do.
