7499067,comment,7497533,7497533,5,0,thrownaway2424,,,"I moved to SF 20 years ago and to oakland 5 years ago. The differences are pretty huge. Main thing for me is oakland is the place where people make things. There are lots of cabinet makers, butchers, shipwrights, and suchlike places. Even things that people might associate with sf are sometimes made in oakland, like boccalone meats, or blue bottle coffee. There are loads of hacker spaces and coops, too.<p>If you want to start a business you could hardly find a better place. Real estate is cheap. Labor is readily available up and down the scale. You can find plenty of janitors, stone masons, or maybe you can even poach employees tired of the commute to Facebook or genentech or yahoo. Transportation costs approximate zero since there is no parking pressure, a subway, a sprawling bus system, and mainline train service, which even sf lacks.<p>So if you are out to start a business oakland makes sense. If you want to be in the valley scene then of course it makes no sense at all, not being in the valley and all that.",1396231174
7499066,comment,7498573,7498954,7,0,001sky,,,"Patents and trademarks are not &quot;intellectual property&quot;. They are temporary monopoly privledges. Before the americans came along, these ideas were blatant and well understood. Somewhere around the time of thr french revolution, rewarding special interests with monopoly privledges became scary, because it seemed an awful lot like the fake rights given to the aristocracy. So the monopolists and the  special interest lobby re-packaged the same crap in the lingo of the french revolution and the enlightenment. The &quot;enlightened&quot; marketing PR spin for government granted monopoly became &quot;rights&quot; as a result. The &quot;intellectual&quot; was adopted under the umpbrella of meritocracy and rule by the learned (ie, as opposed to &quot;birth&quot; rights).

I have about $5000 and I&#x27;m willing to put that into an idea, and I have some of those too. So who&#x27;s ready to play ball with me?

7499028,comment,7498312,7498312,41,0,pavpanchekha,,,"Here&#x27;s a bit of perspective. By &quot;foundations&quot; for mathematics, we mean a system of <i>inference rules</i> and <i>axioms</i> for mathematics. A very limited but correct view of mathematics is that it is a game, where the inference rules are the available &quot;moves&quot;, and the axioms are the &quot;starting position&quot;. Given these two things, we can work out all the theorems we can possibly prove (this is because of Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem—not his incompleteness theorem, that&#x27;s a different thing).<p>Now, at this point a lot of programming-oriented people get confused, because they think, &quot;how can you ever change the foundations? How can you do any math at all until you&#x27;ve completely formally defined the foundations of the subject?&quot; This is a philosophical question, but in truth foundations of math aren&#x27;t as hugely important as you might think. Here&#x27;s an analogy: on both Windows and Linux you can write an email client. Now, the process will not be identical: some things that are easy on Windows are harder on Linux, and vice versa. But at the end of the day, the result on either platform will recognizable be an email client, and your major challenges will probably be email challenges, not platform challenges. Most mathematicians do not work at the foundations—they work at foundations for their specific field (a ring theorist cares about the properties of rings, not often the properties of sets, for example). You can analogize this to using a framework, like GTK for example.<p>On the other hand, some subjects are poorly served by certain foundations, and some of the newer subjects in mathematics are running into that problem. The most pressing examples are category theory and homotopy theory, both of which are based on a study of <i>operations</i>, not <i>objects</i>, in a technical way that is poorly served by the current consensus foundation for mathematics. This would be like really wanting to write mobile apps—Windows would not be a good platform for it, and Android would be. As a PL theorist and kind-of-mathematician, I think the work going on in the Univalent Foundations project to be really interesting and extremely beautiful. I think it will have a profound impact on our understanding of mathematical foundations and higher-order logic, and I&#x27;m excited to see what comes of this effort. But I don&#x27;t think it will really impact mathematics all that much—the impact of categorical thinking is the really important change, and that is helped, but not much, by new foundations.",1396230690

7499003,comment,7498198,7498678,2,0,clin_,,,"> False. In OOP you can do this using the visitor pattern. The difference is that Haskell makes this real convenient, with its algebraic types feature baked into the language, while OOP makes it very cumbersome.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re on the same page here. I meant to say that Haskell protects against inconsistent states: you literally cannot create a dead player with HP and Inventory records. I don&#x27;t have a strong grasp on the visitor pattern, but I&#x27;m not sure how it can be used to accomplish compile time guarantees that the properties of an object will always be correct.<p>> It&#x27;s still far more annoying when the language is lazily evaluated and has Haskell syntax.<p>Python:<p><pre><code>  def f(x,y):\n      print x, y\n      return x + y\n</code></pre>\nHaskell:<p><pre><code>  f x y = traceShow (x, y) (x + y)\n</code></pre>\nLaziness is a separate issue altogether. Debugging lazy behavior is difficult in any language, and you would have similar problems in Python if you were testing deeply nested generators.<p>That said, laziness should not be an issue if you are simply testing that functions are correct, since most functions are pure and you will almost never use lazy IO.<p>If you need to debug evaluation order or a memory leak, that&#x27;s much harder, and admitted one of Haskell&#x27;s biggest weaknesses. My answer here is that you should almost always prefer strict data structures and functions unless you really need laziness. That&#x27;s not a cure all, but it is a good policy when programming in Haskell.",1396230261

7499001,comment,7498198,7498686,2,0,revcbh,,,"Let&#x27;s use circles and rectangels to motivate some analysis. In Haskell you might define:<p><pre><code>  data Point = Point { x :: Float, y :: Float }\n    deriving(Generic)\n  data Shape =\n    Circle { center :: Point, radius :: Float }\n    | Rectangle { topLeft :: Point, bottomRight :: Point }\n      deriving(Generic)\n</code></pre>\nIn C# you could similarly define<p><pre><code>  class Point {\n    public float _x, _y;\n    public Point(float x, float y) {\n      _x = x;\n      _y = y;\n    }\n  }\n\n  interface Shape {}\n  class Circle {\n    public Point _center;\n    public float _radius;\n    public Circle(Point center, float radius) {\n      _center = center\n      _radius = radius\n    }\n  }\n  // etc, for Rectangle ...\n</code></pre>\nLet&#x27;s start from the C# end of things. Let&#x27;s say we want to do some tests on random Shapes and that we want to get an instance of a random shape by calling Generate.random<Shape>(). There are a couple of different ways to do this. We could explicitly define a RandomShapeFactory and a RandomPointFactory and then wire those up into the Generate class. Maybe we could use reflection to dynamically generate instances of Points and Shapes from their definitions at runtime. It would probably end up looking like some combination of the two.<p>Haskell doesn&#x27;t let you magically generate random instances of Shape. The cool thing it gives is the &quot;deriving(Generic)&quot; part. Effectively, this causes the compiler to generate a description of Point and the Shape-Circle-Rectangle set of types. In many ways, it&#x27;s like C#&#x27;s reflection. The QuickCheck library uses this reflection-like definition to generate random instances.<p>The core functionality isn&#x27;t very different, but Haskell&#x27;s approach has a number of advantages. Most importantly, it&#x27;s type-checked at compile-time. In the C# version, I could call Generate.random<Cat> and the code would blow up at run-time, whereas we would just get a compiler error in Haskell. The other major advantage in this case is the reduction of boiler-plate. There&#x27;s no need to register factory instances inside of some singleton object at startup, the type system can infer which Generic components are needed where.<p>C# and Haskell are both turning complete, so you can do anything in either language. Haskell makes certain types of programming more enjoyable by reducing boiler-plate and preventing annoying runtime errors.<p>EDIT - code formatting",1396230199

Now the parent says that should be fine for official drivers because MongoDB isn&#x27;t going to sue themselves, but the issue is for community drivers, like the Node Driver or the Golang driver. Since the AGPL states that any software built for the exclusive use for the accompanying software must be AGPL - then it follows that community drivers should be AGPL as well.<p>To me that means not only can you not modify the database, but you cannot modify the drivers. And I&#x27;m also unsure if that also means that any applications that link those drivers means that they must be AGPL as well. And if your web application must be AGPL, it also means that the source of whatever service you are providing must be available as well.

And because you finally have abstractions which are good (not brittle or leaky) you can build on them to create larger abstractions (by &quot;abstraction&quot; here, think: conceptual unit that is easy to reason about).

Here&#x27;s a list of things that worry me, specifically related to Facebook, but they can apply in other cases.<p>- Private messages. These can be really dangerous for personal relationships and community standing if leaked.<p>- Profiling data: friendship graphs, location pings, browsing history, political alignment, sexuality, religion. Can be used to make targeted attacks on individuals by predicting their behaviors; to track an individual&#x27;s influence in communities; to create credible misinformation about the target or their community; to make strategic decisions that will minimize a person&#x27;s/community&#x27;s influence in the outcome (for instance, politically).<p>- Images. Can be used with automated systems to deanonymize crowds and thus passively surveil.<p>The issue isn&#x27;t so much zero-sum. I&#x27;m not worried about a sudden crackdown on citizens that&#x27;s orchestrated through this data, because there are other more relevant safeguards (like cultural health and the functioning political process). I&#x27;m more worried about the value of the information as intelligence in political strategy.<p>Anthony Weiner&#x27;s embarrassing blow-up is a good extreme example - not that he was targeted (it appeared to have been self-inflicted) but it shows what embarrassing information can do to a politician. Facebook has that in spades, and I&#x27;m certain there will be politicians looking to buy.<p>The more subtle applications are more troubling. Applied well, the dataset could be queried for potential or active dissidents and used to discredit them. It wouldn&#x27;t be hard, either. Make an anonymous tip to someone&#x27;s SO that they cheated once, perhaps - if their marriage blows up publicly, that&#x27;s a success. Think of a pastor or a CEO, in that case.<p>This sort of thing doesn&#x27;t happen yet (I hope) but information &quot;wants to be free,&quot; which is why you can&#x27;t let it out once. As I suggested before, there&#x27;s system breaches, unethical sale of data (perhaps even by employees) government mandates. It&#x27;s not like any of it is unheard of even before the big data era. And even if most citizens are not a target, by complying with the arrangement, we endanger the people who could protect us by dissenting. The health of our cultures and our republics relies on distributed pockets of inalienable authority - in this case, over private information.<p>Should you stop using Facebook? I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s all about trade-offs. I do my best, but I&#x27;ve still got a gmail account and a linode setup, the former because I&#x27;m more worried about system breaches with my email, the latter because I can&#x27;t afford dedicated hosting. I don&#x27;t like either situation. You can call me a bit hypocritical for that too, but the situation is partially social, so I advocate for change as hard as I can.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been thinking the best strategy possible would be to call for Facebook to release self-hosting software that&#x27;s still compatible with their network.

While I believe in fighting for our constitutional rights politically, private solutions are also a viable means of protest.<p>We probably <i>will</i> have liability issues down the road. Nobody said this would be easy. However, being completely transparent and publishing all our code open-source will help mitigate a lot of these issues. On top of this, by making the clients able to secure their own data, the company itself can respond to any government information requests without actually revealing any customer data.",1396227687

I think Mongo is a thing because people coming from Rails ORM libraries feel like &quot;wow I can jump on the no-sql bandwagon just by using a library that feels kind of like the ActiveRecord I&#x27;m used to&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s only popular because there&#x27;s less of a conceptual gap between mongo and the relational database tools that a lot of people are used to.<p>Couchdb on the other hand requires you to actually learn and use map/reduce.. which is a pain for people who don&#x27;t feel like having to learn something new, but Couchdb is MUCH MUCH better in a lot of ways and Mongo is pretty much fundamentally flawed in my opinion<p>I do wish rackspace luck though with their offering.  I think it was smart of them to create this mongodb product for one simple reason:  a good number of people are already using mongodb so it makes sense to help them get the most out of it.",1396227678

Facebook is largely regarded as a necessary evil by many people, especially technical folks, and yet these guys are surprised that people might worry that you&#x27;ll need a Facebook account in order to use it? Or that Facebook will insert some microcode or firmware doing satan-knows-what and requiring authorization for any usage? That&#x27;s not paranoia or irrational hand wringing; it&#x27;s exactly the kind of thing these folks are up to because their business model isn&#x27;t charging for a service, it&#x27;s selling people&#x27;s information to other businesses.<p>But death threats are not acceptable.
