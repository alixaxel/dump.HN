It was also updated to clarify that the companies challenged the secrecy surrounding Section 702 orders. Other minor clarifications were also made.&quot;<p>They may have updated their article to excise the denials about PRISM - however the water is still muddy regarding the truthfulness of their statements under numerous other programs that the NSA has conducted under other legal authorities like Section 702, Section 215, etc..",1395813568

7471826,comment,7471594,7471594,15,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"Facebook missed mobile. This was a concern pre- and immediately post-IPO. It took an engineering overhaul and tens of billions of dollars in acquisitions to bridge the gap.<p>The Occulus VR acquisition looks like Facebook hedging its bets with the future of consumer computing UX. Better $2 billion and, say, $200 million a year for ten years today than $19 billion tomorrow. Or so it seems he is thinking.<p>Still, I like to check the math. Occulus VR says it has sold 75 000 &quot;development kits&quot; [1]. It has been 1 year and 7 months since August 2012 [2], when Occulus VR began selling its development kits. Let&#x27;s assume a 200% YoY 2013 growth rate - that means 56 000 kits were sold in 2013. Let&#x27;s say these keep selling at the $350 the Developer Kit 2 goes for [3]. That&#x27;s $20 million in 2013 revenues. Let&#x27;s turn that into $2 million of profits - a 10% margin.<p>Let&#x27;s value Occulus VR as if it were a growing perpetuity. If Facebook had a cost of capital of {10%, 20%, 30%}, Occulus VR free cash flow (FCF) would have to grow at least {10%, 20%, 30%} a year. Otherwise, its $2 billion price tag would not make sense.<p>Companies are not immortal. Let&#x27;s value Occulus VR as a 20-year growing annuity. Setting Facebook&#x27;s cost of capital at {10%, 20%, 30%}, Occulus VR&#x27;s FCF would have to grow at least {45%, 58%, 71%} a year.<p>Not a bad deal.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/oculus-joins-facebook/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oculusvr.com/blog/oculus-joins-facebook/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift#History</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.oculusvr.com/order/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.oculusvr.com/order/</a>",1395812751

To be honest, if I were you, I would probably have a similar initial impression! There are a lot of reasons why this is a good thing, many of which are not yet public. A lot of people obviously feel the same way you do, so I definitely want to address your points:<p>> The appeal of Oculus (as compared to Sony, for example) is because it is on a PC platform, and thus allows us, the developers, freedom over what we want to do with it.<p>None of that will change. Oculus continues to operate
independently! We are going to remain as indie/developer
/enthusiast friendly as we have always been, if not more
so. This deal lets us dedicate a lot of resources to developer relations, technical help, engine optimizations, and our content investment/publishing/sales platform. We are not going to track you, flash ads at you, or do anything invasive.<p>> The Rift is absolutely targeted towards the gaming population, which tends to be teenage to early 20s/30s, which is the exact population that Facebook is currently losing. By partnering with Facebook, you are gaining access to a massive userbase of people that the rift is not targeted towards, which people might feel is a very bad move.<p>Almost everyone at Oculus is a gamer, and virtual reality will certainly be led by the games industry, largely because it is the only industry that already has the talent and tools required to build awesome interactive 3D environments. In the long run, though, there are going to be a lot of other industries that use VR in huge ways, ways that are not exclusive to gamers; the current focus on gaming is a reflection of the current state of VR, not the long term potential. Education, communication, training, rehabilitation, gaming and film are all going to be major drivers for VR, and they will reach a very wide audience. We are not targeting social media users, we are targeting everyone who has a reason to use VR.<p>> What we fear is not that Oculus will be partnering with Facebook, but that you are selling out the company to Facebook and no longer retain control over Oculus. I can say that I, personally, support Oculus because I believed in the goals and visions that you had.<p>This acquisition/partnership gives us more control of our destiny, not less! We don&#x27;t have to compromise on anything, and can afford to make decisions that are right for the future of virtual reality, not our current revenue. Keep in mind that we already have great partners who invested heavily in Oculus and got us to where we are, so we have not had full control of our destiny for some time. Facebook believes in our long term vision, and they want us to continue executing on our own roadmap, not control what we do. I would never have done this deal if it meant changing our direction, and Facebook has a good track record of letting companies work independently post-acquisition.<p>There is a lot of related good news on the way. I am swamped right now, but I do plan on addressing everyone&#x27;s concerns. I think everyone will see why this is so incredible when the big picture is clear.&quot;<p>----<p>and also <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/21cy9n/the_future_of_vr/cgc026n"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/oculus/comments/21cy9n/the_future_of...</a>:<p>&quot;We have not gotten into all the details yet, but a lot of the news is coming.

Do you want to get them fired?<p>> there are no good rational reasons to do that<p>If you lived in the south bay area like I do, you&#x27;d suffer far more oppression from people with houses that oppose any and all kinds of development, than you would from the government not recognizing gay marriage (if you were gay).  These people cost me thousands of dollars per year, and they make poorer people even worse off, driving them out of high-rent communities into far more dangerous areas and making them spend time and energy commuting.  If some home-owner from west of El Camino that donated to the &quot;Residents First&quot; candidate&#x27;s campaign in the Mountain View city elections became the CEO of Mozilla, how should I feel then?  His cause is based in purely wicked selfishness, not some arbitrary nonsensical moral axioms or reasoning that you might call irrational.<p>At least Eich donated against Prop. 8 because he thought it was the right thing to do.  He didn&#x27;t gain any personal benefit from that donation -- it was at quite direct harm to himself (to the tune of $1000).  That donation is actually a positive sign of moral character, relative to most people&#x27;s bland non-contributing apathy.  He just has bad moral axioms or couldn&#x27;t think about this matter rationally.<p>> Again, they can&#x27;t be trusted to treat homosexuals well in other contexts where they might have power.<p>I don&#x27;t think you have an accurate model of how the average pious Christian that lives in California would behave (assuming that&#x27;s the root cause of Eich&#x27;s choices).  You&#x27;ve come to false conclusions about what donating to anti-gay-marriage causes implies about one&#x27;s personal attitude towards gay people.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s some form of hypothetical marriage license that you wouldn&#x27;t be in favor of, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re bigoted against those people.  The state doesn&#x27;t approve of anything but nuclear family marriage and its same-sex facsimile.  I don&#x27;t think that you&#x27;d be evil or couldn&#x27;t be reasoned with if you believed that the state should encourage this social structure, it&#x27;s just that your moral axioms or your views on what marriage is for are (probably) different than mine.<p>Actually, I&#x27;m just trying to be persuasive.  The real reason you&#x27;re wrong is that your opinion is built on your delusion that you and other people have free will, specifically, that of Eich having it.  Going from the free will to no-free-will perspective, your attitude towards Eich maps to an attitude towards the universe being imperfect.  So it happens to be imperfect in a way visible at the top of Mozilla.  Big whoop.",1395810091
