My concerns that I wrote down were actually my wifes concerns, they always seem to have the final say in who takes care of the kids if both parents aren&#x27;t around. I&#x27;m sure my level of trust will improve as my daughter gets older but at this age (2) I wouldn&#x27;t leave her with anybody for her sake and for the sitters sake.<p>With respect to AirBnB and car-sharing schemes and the like - there&#x27;s an order of magnitude difference in how much I care if my house/car gets trashed vs something happening to my daughter. Sure I care in the first case, but I personally can see tech overcoming that.",1394168830

7358600,comment,7358333,7358333,5,0,comex,,,"> The internal electronics on the SideWinder X4 use a variant of resistive multitouch technology. Each key has a screen printed resistor in series with its switch. This allows the internal electronics to read the state of each key switch independently for very large multiple-key combinations.<p>This is pretty vague.  How exactly does this disambiguate which keys are being pressed?",1394168812

The last MS keyboard I could actually type on was the Wireless Multimedia one (now discontinued).<p>Keyboards in the last few years have had:<p>- Mushy key feel. I can&#x27;t tell when I&#x27;ve actually done a keystroke.<p>- Keys that are hard to strike (need to press on them just right, or they hang up or don&#x27;t register). This is particularly bad on the wider keys.<p>- Keytops too close together; I mash multiple keys.<p>- Embarrassingly bad features: Function-key lock is the classic one here. Let&#x27;s not talk about the &#x27;diamond&#x27; arrow keys that have occasionally appeared.<p>I&#x27;d buy half a dozen &quot;Natural&quot; keyboards with decent Cherry hardware running the show, ESC in the right spot, and no wacky features. I don&#x27;t even need a numeric keypad. I&#x27;d pay more money for some remapping (though just about any 20 cent microcontroller will have enough EEPROM to do this).<p>Whaddya say, Microsoft?
