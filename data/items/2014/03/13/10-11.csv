7391041,comment,7390638,7390694,8,0,pawelk,,,"> In terms of his house and the like, I was always led to believe that life insurance was specifically for cases like his? Is life insurance a big thing in America?<p>I found the &quot;Pay off our mortgage&quot; part a bit strange. Living in Poland I don&#x27;t know anyone who managed to get a mortgage without mandatory life insurance which makes the bank the first beneficiary. You die, they get the money, mortgage is paid off, family keeps the house. Pople like to bitch that it&#x27;s a scam, hidden cost, extra money for the bank etc, but it&#x27;s designed for situations like this (it protects the bank as well as the customer).",1394708320

Or at least make the borrower opt into insurance by default with the option of opting out.<p>Left to themselves borrowers are not likely to think about insurance at the time of taking loans.

Being woke up by my wife crying because the donations just aren&#x27;t stopping is both heart-breaking and comforting.<p>For those of you who haven&#x27;t seen the &#x27;Bucket List&#x27; post, here&#x27;s what it says at the very top:<p>As I try to deal with the reality that is my impending death I can&#x27;t help but wonder how many things I might have been able to accomplish given just a little more time. When I was diagnosed, I had only one thing that I wanted; to live long enough to see my children grow up. The reality is that the odds of me living long enough to see my children grow are quite slim. The only available treatment will eventually stop working and then it&#x27;s just a matter of time.<p>This is the list of things that I want to accomplish while I still have time. Many of them aren&#x27;t for me. They are for my family. They are meant to provide security for my wife and kids so that they can celebrate my life instead of mourning my death when that time comes.<p>My priorities are taking care of my family just as they always have been. Sometimes, we just can&#x27;t plan far enough ahead to deal with something like this. If you saw the original page you would also note that Trips and meeting celebrities is not high on my list of priorities. Those are things that would provide me with a small boost on an emotional level but I don&#x27;t consider them something that must happen before I die.<p>Life Insurance: I changed jobs and don&#x27;t have any and now that I&#x27;m terminal, the cost for obtaining it is prohibitive. I agree that this is poor planning on my part, however, I&#x27;m 35 and no one expects to find out that they are going to die at 35. We all think we have plenty of time and the reality is that we don&#x27;t.<p>Health Insurance: Thank god that I have this or we would&#x27;ve been sunk from the beginning. Despite having insurance, there continue to be ongoing costs and once I go on long-term disability I&#x27;ll be paying cobra rates to keep the same coverage. I have no idea how expensive this will be but I don&#x27;t expect it to be cheap.<p>This really isn&#x27;t about me or the money, this is about my family and trying to ease their pain. I know that I&#x27;m living on borrowed time right now and I could be dead at any moment. All I want to do is spend as much time as I can with my kids so that they know I loved them. You try telling a 6 year old that her daddy has cancer and will be dead before she turns 8. Hardest thing I&#x27;ve ever had to do and I would never wish it any one.<p>For those of you that have helped us, thank you is not enough.",1394707987

Take Australia for example; even though it is a federation of states (and territories) like the US it has one uniform goods and sales tax that is consistent across the country. In fact states regularly come together to share best practice between legislation and administration in order to increase efficiencies within the country. Even road laws (which are a state matter in Australia) have been deliberately homogenised between states. Even countries like the UK with it&#x27;s constituent nations and territories work hard at having a uniform and efficient system for businesses to do what they need to do.<p>Saying &quot;Just deal with it&quot; is a cop out that will end up consigning your country to a worsening economic future.

7390985,comment,7390638,7390912,6,0,epsylon,,,"Unfortunately, your comment isn&#x27;t at the top.<p>There are very simple guidelines that can help prevent melanoma, especially for people at risk: \n- Avoid exposing your skin to the sun, especially when it&#x27;s high. Use high SPF (30+) sun screen (water resistant if you&#x27;ll be swimming); wear longsleeves, hats and sunglasses. (Good sunglasses are important, as you can have <i>ocular melanoma</i>)\n- Obviously, don&#x27;t use tanning booths.\n- Plan a visit with a dermatologist at least once per year. This is very important. Just like you&#x27;d get your tooth, eyes, etc... checked every year, take the habit to see a dermatologist.\n- If you&#x27;re especially at risk, regulary check your skin for signs of changes. Nowadays it&#x27;s easy to take pictures with a digital camera (or phone) so that you can see how the spots and moles evolve.<p>How do you know if you&#x27;re in the population at risk? If you have moles, <i>OR</i> are fair-skinned / haired, <i>OR</i> have freckles (all of these are usuall signs of an overall general sensitivity to sun exposure), you are at risk. Obviously, if there are family antecedants of skin cancer, you are at risk. Also, if your work or hobbies expose your skin regularly and for prolonged periods of time to the Sun, you are at risk.<p>Personal story: I have a friend who has had a mole removed in the knee, and which proved to be ultimately (after testing) malignant. Fortunately this was caught early. And I&#x27;ve had personnally a mole removed in the back, though it was found to be benign. \nSkin cancer risk can be greatly reduced by these simple precautions, so please people, try to follow these.",1394707145

7390920,comment,7390638,7390801,9,0,bad_user,,,"Don&#x27;t know if you noticed, but in western countries the population is aging, due to a decrease in birth rate/fertility, a decrease in mortality rate and a higher life expectancy, all leading to a sharp decline in population growth. Europe has a Wikipedia page about it, check it out: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Europe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Europe</a><p>Population growth is not really exponential, it&#x27;s rather an S-curve. As soon as the quality of life reaches a certain threshold, that growth stagnates. And btw, we have long surpassed the need to be healthy in order to reproduce. Assuming somebody that dies at 35 for various reasons, by then that person could have given birth to 10 children already, something which happens quite often in the impoverished populations of third-world countries.<p>At this point, what we really need to do in order to survive as a species is in fact to eliminate premature death, to raise the quality of life for everybody and to find ways to drop the cost of energy and food to zero - a long shot, but in such a future money wouldn&#x27;t be needed anymore to simply live, the economy wouldn&#x27;t depend anymore on birth rate and maybe we would stop feeling the need to destroy our environment for profit. And maybe we won&#x27;t feel the need to give birth to children in order to survive.<p>Besides, unless you&#x27;re a selfish jerk (and selfish jerks don&#x27;t contribute much to our species btw), you should agree with me that nothing is more valuable than human life.",1394705820
