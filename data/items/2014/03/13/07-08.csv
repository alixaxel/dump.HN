A 777 flies at an altitude and velocity because it is optimal. Arrive at the right altitude and location, spoof a transponder, <i>and</i> replicate a believable velocity?<p>Who could do that? The US, Taiwan, China, Japan? And yet, if any of those used something like an Aegis class missile cruiser to launch something we haven&#x27;t heard of before, it would still be absurd, since this will draw more attention and resources devoted to investigating the cause than even something like the murder of JFK if it is a big enough mystery.<p>Someone with the resources of a nation state (most likely necessary to spoof and replace a 777 at cruising altitude) could also figure out other ways to assassinate a person that are less likely to be sufficiently investigated to decipher.",1394697426

7390532,comment,7388014,7390204,4,0,jnbiche,,,"You and I disagreed about Rust&#x27;s complexity in the past.  In the meanwhile, I&#x27;ve actually come to appreciate Rust for the reasons you outlined above.  It really is the only new (non-research) language with modern features that also includes a deterministic, safe, GC-free memory management, which fills a big hole.  And it&#x27;s a cool language, with a nice, functional feel, particularly with how the standard library is shaping up.<p>However, let&#x27;s be clear that the pointer semantics do bring a great deal of complexity to the language.<p>That said, I&#x27;m very impressed that the managed pointer sigil has been eliminated and the feature moved to the stdlib.  That and the fact that Rust&#x27;s team has clearly pushed the message that owned pointers are the idiomatic way to deal with memory in Rust have combined to bring a lot of clarity to the language.  Also, as stated above, I really like the direction that the standard library is taking.  So congrats on a job well-done.<p>Edit: Let me also congratulate you on the Rust compiler error messages, which are almost invariably clear and actionable compared with other languages I&#x27;m playing with in this space.",1394697230

You stick one of those suckers into an AtomicReference and presto you&#x27;ve got a thread-safe data-structure. And for more complicated scenarios, you also have Scala-STM: <a href=""http://nbronson.github.io/scala-stm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nbronson.github.io/scala-stm/</a><p>Even though the concurrent data-structures in Java&#x27;s library are efficient and well built, they remain error-prone because thread-safe operations are not composable. Working with immutable data-structures in a high concurrency scenario is the best thing since sliced bread.<p>I do agree with your point - sane concurrency implies using the right abstractions for the job and there are cases in which you need shared memory storage. The JVM is in fact great because it does 1:1 multithreading, because the GC is so good that it allows you to be a little wasteful and because it provides the required concurrency primitives to build whatever abstraction on top that you desire.<p>For Scala + the JVM, just to enumerate - you&#x27;ve got actors by means of Akka and it&#x27;s pretty capable as it&#x27;s flexible and it allows you to manipulate/coordinate entire clusters of remote actors (and of course there&#x27;s Quasar that does the lightweight threads thing and I&#x27;d love a comparison between the two btw), you&#x27;ve got the Future/Promise concept baked in and with a sane design [2], with C#&#x27;s &quot;async&quot; by means of a library that will be part of the standard [3], you&#x27;ve got great immutable data-structures that also have parallel extensions [4], you&#x27;ve got RxJava/RxScala for processing streams of events reactively [5], or Iteratee IO for safe processing of data streams [6], or shared transactional memory that I mentioned above [7] and of course things inherited from Java, like NIO which in spite of its flaws it&#x27;s the sanest cross-platform abstraction over native APIs for async I/O, plus as I&#x27;ve said, the best cross-platform concurrency primitives you can get (e.g. I still get boners every time I use ReentrantReadWriteLock).<p>[1] <a href=""http://akka.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://akka.io/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/futures.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://github.com/scala/async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/scala/async</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/parallel-collections/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/parallel-collections/ov...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Iteratees"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Iteratees</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://nbronson.github.io/scala-stm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nbronson.github.io/scala-stm/</a>",1394697092

Whenever I go into one of my own anti-&quot;Agile&quot; rants, among my main points is that formal organizational process is simply unnecessary with talented, motivated development teams.  In my long experience across many start-ups (which tend to get the aforementioned sorts of teams), if you just put a bunch of really smart people (devs) in a room with a project to do, Good Things happen.  They know what needs to be done.  They know how to do it.  Any kind of formal development methodology just gets in the way.  Management in those environments (and I&#x27;ve done that) is about care and feeding and listening and gaining consensus.  It&#x27;s not about religion or process.  When I first read the Manifesto, not long after it came out, my reaction was YES!  But in no time the Formal Methodologists came out of the woodwork and hijacked the whole thing, turning an attractive philosophy into just another management fad, one with nearly  as much religious orthodoxy as what it replaced.

Pasting it here for convenience:<p><i>&quot;There are a number of troubles with that theory Charles, one of which is that the plane should have followed its intended course and stayed on radar by passive reflection, but it is certainly also one of my favourite theories right now.<p>The lack of debris near where it disappeared from the radar opens the door to more &quot;interesting&quot; theories, such as kidnapping or theft.<p>First of all, identifying planes by transponder code is not hard ID.<p>It would be perfectly possible for co-conspirator plane to fly transponder-less up to the target plane, take over the transponder code, and fly decoy on the official route, while the MH370 goes elsewhere.<p>That means that the point of &quot;last contact&quot; doesn&#x27;t tell us anything but the existence of an electronic device acting like a transponder at that time and place.<p>Turning the transponder off and tailing another transpondered plane very closely is another way to disappear from ATC without plastering the surface with debris and then you are also more or less free to go wherever you want, until somebody visually spots two planes very close.<p>The decoy plane does not need to be the same size, so the probability of such visual detection would be low.<p>Therefore, suspecting foul play, we don&#x27;t have any trustworthy information about the planes whereabouts after the last visual sighting of the plane.<p>It would be interesting to know if there were any high-value targets on that plane, amongst the passengers or in the cargo.<p>If the cargo was the interesting bit, killing off all the passengers by dropping pressure and oxygen is trivial.<p>One interesting nugget is the rumour that &quot;passengers phones are still ringing&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s sufficiently implausible that nobody would take it seriously and actually follow the SS7 data.<p>But if true, it would be explained by the plane sitting somewhere at the edge of a jungle, for instance on the remains of an old WW2 strip, passengers dead, and cargo gone.&quot;</i>",1394694569

There are competing interpreters like Havok.<p>However, vanilla Lua is pretty fast to begin with. Additionally, the types of optimization you do with vanilla Lua are the opposite kind you do with LuaJIT and vice versa. Generally you need to decide early in the project which you want to go with because it impacts how you write code. And it isn&#x27;t always guaranteed that LuaJIT will be faster. And since game engine cores are written in C/C++, this optimization works against LuaJIT.<p>Ultimately, games need to stay within their fps budget. If Lua is high on the CPU, but the game is still in budget, nobody really cares. And CPU profiling doesn&#x27;t always tell the whole story since many things can be GPU bound. It could very well be that the game is already GPU bound so getting more CPU back won&#x27;t help.",1394694097
