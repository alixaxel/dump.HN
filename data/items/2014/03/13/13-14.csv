7391779,comment,7391716,7391716,5,0,kldavis4,,,"The logic of this argument seems flawed. I assume the goal here is to get young, uninsured people to buy health insurance. The argument here is that by buying an ACA plan, individuals will be more free to start their own business because they won&#x27;t have to worry about getting sick without insurance. If I am risk averse, I will simply pursue full time employment that include health insurance benefits. If I am young and willing to forgo salary and benefits for a startup, why would I weigh the risk of getting sick while uninsured any more than the other risks involved in a business venture. Based on what I&#x27;ve seen of the costs of ACA plans, it seems like someone working in a ramen profitable startup would not even be able to afford the insurance offered.",1394719053

7391777,comment,7387524,7390161,1,0,mberning,,,"I have no doubt that a highly disciplined individual could accomplish such a feat. But then add a wife or husband. Then add a child. It seems increasingly less likely for an average or even above average saver to accomplish what is being espoused. At least without major push back from the other people you are attempting to subject to this lifestyle.<p>I am honestly wondering what they do when people they know are doing something that costs money. Do they just skip it? Birthday dinner @ a restaurant - skip it. Going to a sporting event - skip it. Kid is getting made fun of at school for wearing dollar store shoes - skip it. Kid wants to play school sports but costs $300/sport - skip it. Kid wants to go to dinner/movies with classmates - skip it. Holidays roll around, time to exchange gifts - skip it.<p>I guess what I am trying to say is that while extreme saving is a laudable goal, I highly doubt that their family budget is so neat and tidy. Exceptions come up all the time and you would have to put forth heroic efforts to say &#x27;no&#x27; to most or all of them. You would also be making huge sacrifices and asking your SO and children to do the same.",1394719048

My mother died of breast cancer at 59 and it really didn&#x27;t cost her anything thanks to the fact she had health insurance through my father&#x27;s work.

Sure it make sense now that small iterative releases, continuous integration, automated tests, customer collaboration, etc will produce better software.  And yes there were teams that did this before Agile became popular, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t the norm.<p>There used to be no standard way to write/run unit tests.  The class of software called continuous integration server did not exist.  Gant charts were completely normal planning devises.<p>I&#x27;ve worked in environments that literally believed that a senior developer could use uml to design the entire system down to the method level and then it would be a trivial matter for a junior developer to &quot;fill it in&quot;.  That sounds insane now, but it happened throughout the software industry.<p>Agile didn&#x27;t fail, it worked so well it became the norm, and now the term is being co-opted by opportunists.

7391757,comment,7390638,7390801,1,0,vidarh,,,"> edit: Downvote brigade... why am I wrong?<p>Most projections have the worlds population set to start <i>reducing</i> again within a few decades, and then likely stabilise well below the projected peak.<p>Here is UN&#x27;s latest revision of their &quot;World Population to 2300&quot; report: <a href=""https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/Wo...</a><p>This report presents a main scenario with a peak of 9.22 billion in 2075, followed by a drop and slow resumption of growth towards 8.97 billion by 2300. It references older UN projections that indicates a range from 7.4 billion to 10.6 billion for 2050 depending on scenario.<p>This current report assumes 8.9 billion for 2050, and projects annual increases in population sizes down to 0.33% in 2045-2050, vs. 1.22% in 2000-2005<p>This comes as more and more countries sees rapid decline in birth rates equivalent to those that the developed world has already seen.<p>Particularly look at pages 6-8 in the report, where you can get an idea what we would expect to see if cancer was &quot;cured&quot;: Life expectancy and fertility mirror each other closely. As we live longer, we put off having children, have fewer children, or opt not to have children at all.<p>Even if we were to cure all forms of cancer, people would continue to die of other causes eventually. At most a cure would lead the population size to level out at a somewhat higher level because we might have children proportionally earlier in a life span so generations would overlap more. But we have to deal with these population numbers without a cure for cancer too, to deal with the bulge around the peak population sizes expected.<p>While pension-age might be a problem, if people remain healthier longer there&#x27;s little reason not to increase the pension age, as some countries have already started doing.",1394718674

Or, as I used to call it, to the left of the middle of nowhere, because at least the middle of nowhere had an intellectually interesting distinction of being in the middle of something.<p>Yeah, it&#x27;s &quot;boring&quot; out there.

It&#x27;s &quot;boring&quot; here, when all there is to do is go check out world-class art museums and Michelin-rated restaurants. I miss sledding in the snow. I miss seeing the stars every night--all of them. I miss not living under an airport takeoff path.<p>Point being, people have a tendency to do 10% of what a place has to offer and assume the other 90% is the same.

With MDA, you sacrificed the graphics but the  characters in text mode were rendered with a 9x14 bitmap rather than an 8x8 bitmap.  This resulted in a huge quality improvement.

A fusion energy source emits gamma rays which form the hologram, and in turn the hologram shapes the beam, it&#x27;s a feedback effect.<p>A lightsaber beam can block another light beam in the following way - the incoming beam acts as a wiggler for the lightsaber pump photons, which first get downshifted and then disintegrate into matter-antimatter pairs. The trick is to separate the matter from antimatter and channel them into the reactor. So firing at a lightsaber actually charges it.<p>The problem of course is conservation of momentum. To counteract the backwards jolt, a lightsaber creates a forward momentum impulse. This counteraction is not perfect, so Jedi are trained to maintain their balance in such situations.<p>When two lightsabers contact their beams are actually consumed by the other.

At that point, the only thing binding consciousness is the &#x27;idea&#x27; that it belongs to the cells.<p>If you separated them before the host dies, then you&#x27;d have copied the consciousness into the substrate, and they would exist separately until you reattached it.<p>Wait until the host dies, then the consciousness would experience that death yet still persist. It would carry on experiencing through whatever senses the substrate offers.<p>Notice that it&#x27;s not just a signal being transferred, it&#x27;s the actual mechanics of consciousness, neurons firing and communicating. When the substrate, connected to the brain, communicates, it&#x27;s just as if you added brain cells. So it&#x27;s not just a signal, it&#x27;s actual thought.",1394717182

If the pool of potential investors has not been identified, then incorporation as a C-corporation may create an unproductive tax burden.<p>If the purpose is solely to limit liability, then other limited liability forms of organization might make more financial sense and organizing locally might make sense.",1394715764

Sure. Will people with something important to hide still wear disguises? I&#x27;d bet yes.<p>My stance is that we can&#x27;t fight progress, but we can start fighting the people bent on abusing the powers that progress bring. Identifying them is another issue (perhaps some form of facial recognition? :)",1394715752

So far it was JUST for fast shipping.<p>I subscribed for faster/cheaper shipping and canceled now, after a couple years. The streaming services are of no use to me. Most content in Germany is .. German (dubbed). I don&#x27;t see a streaming client on Android or a way to stream from my XBMC. Inaccessible + expensive -> No prime for me anymore.",1394715714

It just seems to be a contradiction that every passenger can take on board and use whatever they want in-flight, yet transponders specially engineered to be safe on a plane must be able to be disabled.<p>I suspect the answer is that the transponder doesn&#x27;t need to be under the control of anyone on the plane.",1394715656
