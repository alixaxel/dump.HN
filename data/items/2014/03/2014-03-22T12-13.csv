BJ is work that is not worth doing <i>at current market prices</i>. I.e., picking up garbage in the park might be worth $4/hour, but minimum wage is $7.25/hour. If we spend $7.25 <i>more</i> and get $4.00 worth of value out of it, we lost $3.25.<p>If we are already spending $7.25 on welfare/BI and getting nothing in return, we are losing $7.25. If we demand that recipients work for their money we lose only $3.25. As long as the BJ workers are not destructive, we lose less money than we otherwise would with welfare or a BI.<p>Also, the jobs need not be &quot;dig a hole and fill it in&quot; - they can also be &quot;walk around town and find potholes to fill tomorrow&quot; or &quot;there is garbage on the streets, go clean it up&quot;. It&#x27;s not as if we have a shortage of things that would be beneficial if we did them. They just might not be worth doing at current prices.",1395493175

We used to race at the track.   He lived until he was 91.   The reality is you can be pretty active and enjoy life well into your 80s but it only takes one thing to go wrong at that age for pretty much everything to stop.   He has a stomach issue where is large intestine just burst... this by itself does not kill someone today - medicine is very good, but eventually it&#x27;s the lack of nutrients and the body just takes forever to heal itself that eventually will catch up to all of us...  The most promising thing I&#x27;ve read about with this regard is the gdf11 discovery by the scientists at Harvard - but like any discovery... there&#x27;s a lot probably missing from it... at any rate, exercising is without a doubt a good thing, but eventually our bodies will just fall apart... literally.",1395492741

It certainly would allow the BI proponents to put their money where the mouth is.  I suspect what makes BI unlikely to succeed is when it&#x27;s proposed as mandatory wealth redistribution, since it&#x27;s never as far as I know been done successfully and the consequences of failure are potentially massive, the risks would seem to outweigh the hypothetical rewards.<p>Would a voluntary pay in system, you could prove it works or doesn&#x27;t work without forcing anyone else to take the risk.

When the same limits are applied for Netflix they are much more damaging as users are actually paying to watch that content, where as YouTube it&#x27;s free, so it&#x27;s annoying for the customer but their not really wasting money on a service that they can&#x27;t use.<p>2) Caching; both Youtube[1] and Netflix [2] offer free on-site caching services for their video content.<p>From personal experience the Google cache is very effective at reducing traffic in your core network. It seems that even though Youtube has thousands of Videos in it&#x27;s library the majority of traffic at anyone time is probably going to a very small selection of this total library, and therefore you get an excellent caching hit rate with only a few small servers.<p>Netflix on the other hand has a bigger problem, their library is also huge however users randomly select what they want to watch and they have to pre-transcode videos into hundreds of different formats for all of the possible devices out there, meaning they have loads of copies of the same film in different resolutions and formats. For the ISP this means you have to have a fairly constant stream of data coming into your network from Netflix just to keep the cache updated, not so effective especially for the smaller ISP&#x27;s.<p>[1] - <a href=""https://peering.google.com/about/ggc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://peering.google.com/about/ggc.html</a>\n[2] - <a href=""https://signup.netflix.com/openconnect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://signup.netflix.com/openconnect</a>",1395491914

7448804,comment,7445685,7448735,7,0,thaumasiotes,,,"Well, Basic Job is sort of by definition work that doesn&#x27;t need doing. There&#x27;s a fundamental conceptual problem with it:<p>Imagine I, for whatever reason, accept a Basic Job from the government. The job is, by design, bad. I&#x27;d rather not do it. So my dream scenario is that I officially hold a Basic Job and draw its meager salary, but instead of doing whatever work it supposedly entails I sit at home and watch TV.<p>This scenario isn&#x27;t just an improvement in my life -- it&#x27;s also an improvement for everyone handling me! The work doesn&#x27;t need to get done; it&#x27;s only there as a penalty for me, to encourage me not to draw the Basic Salary if I don&#x27;t really, truly need it. So when I save myself some effort by not showing up for work, I also <i>save</i> my handlers effort that might have gone into overseeing me. Just as it&#x27;s easier for me to stay home, it&#x27;s easier for them to pretend I didn&#x27;t than to track whether or not I did anything. So overseeing Basic Job is conceptually pretty difficult.<p>I don&#x27;t claim that this is more or less difficult to deal with than the problems of any other welfare system, but it is an obvious and fundamental flaw in the concept, and might help explain why it&#x27;s hard for Basic Job to get traction. On a shallower level, the concept of &quot;pay someone to dig a hole today and fill it in tomorrow&quot; (a.k.a. The Basic Job Concept), has been the go-to example for exactly what we don&#x27;t want government to do for a long, long time. That can also make it difficult to get traction.",1395491844

The price of the fakes varies, the ones that weigh the correct amount come at a premium as you can just put them in to vending machines and get useful stuff in return. The ones that don&#x27;t work that way are obviously harder to spend, particularly if the colour is not quite as shiny as the proper ones. With those you really do run the risk of getting caught, particularly if you tried to pay for £50 of grocery shopping in pound coins that happened to be extra heavy, nearer black in colour than shiny gold and all from the same year...<p>There is a whole other economy out there - think drugs - where fake coins are just another thing to sell/launder. People that buy drugs with a view to selling them in order to make the money needed to pay for their own habit are well placed to &#x27;shift&#x27; fake coins and notes. They are not going to snitch either, this is because most people that buy drugs have just the one supplier, perhaps with someone else they can call on in emergency drought situations. To grass on their dealer is just not going to happen - they would lose their supply, possibly get nicked themselves and create lots of enemies in their scene. If fake coins get passed on through that same supply route then nobody is going to tell.<p>The thing with the coins is that they only have to be passed off once from the &#x27;black&#x27; economy to regular-commerce-land whereas the Royal Mint has to make coins that circulate for decades. For the counterfeiters it is easy to get the Queen&#x27;s head stamped on there with some ridges around the edge, getting the weight and colour finish right has cost implications, hence this is not necessarily done to high-class forgery standards.<p>I do wonder what the police would view as more serious - selling class &#x27;A&#x27; drugs or laundering fake currency. I suspect the latter. Nonetheless, I hope that you now see how counterfeit coins have a route to market, why they don&#x27;t actually have to be that good and how it is that so many exist without anyone being able to say where they come from.",1395491115

In that case, where group &quot;A&quot; outnumbered group &quot;B&quot; substantially in the candidate pool, and yet ALL the people hired were from group &quot;B&quot;, it would be perfectly reasonable to suspect bias or various other factors than pure merit, unless a perfectly objective and fair process were used. Obviously few real world examples are that clear cut.<p>If the &quot;anti-meritocracy&quot; people simply want people and organizations to be less arrogant about believing they have a perfect selection process, I think that&#x27;s a good thing. The  biggest issue I have with the &quot;anti-meritocracy&quot; teams is this: the language that many people use seems calibrated to shame people for even using the word, or thinking of meritocracy as a ideal or target to aim for.<p>Anyone who&#x27;s ever had to hire people for a startup is unlikely to feel terribly arrogant about their process, though - in my experience, people try to make it as systematic as possible and then improvise within that. Certainly, any adjustment to process that makes it less susceptible to prejudice or bigotry is a good step.<p>Obviously, &quot;merit&quot; is a function of a person&#x27;s innate ability, education, effectiveness and fit in a particular role, and a million other factors. It&#x27;s not an exact science. But it&#x27;s a good thing for an organization to decide, at minimum, what does &quot;merit&quot; look like for this particular role or hire? (And, more broadly, what traits of &quot;merit&quot; are shared across the whole organization?)<p>The dictionary definition seems benign enough: &quot;A system in which advancement is based on individual ability or achievement&quot;.
