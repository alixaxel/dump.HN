7339515,comment,7336215,7336215,1,0,m_mueller,,,"I like the idea of using Glacier as a Backup solution for ones devices. However one thing worries me: Looking at the Glacier pricing table[1] there is a section &#x27;Request pricing&#x27;. This looks to me like there is a price of 5.5 cents per 1000 upload request. Considering Arq will upload multiple times an hour, this looks like it could amount to quite a bit. With two uploads per hour I arrive at 5$ per month, but there could be significantly more uploads. Even 5$ would already be a 50% price increase compared to only the storage pricing for 1TB of data.<p>Could anyone clarify whether my calculation is wrong?<p>[1] <a href=""https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/pricing/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://aws.amazon.com/glacier/pricing/</a>",1393930747

When people want to withdraw coins, they must visit the vault location and take money out, where the transaction is verified by a physically present person. The owner of the vault could also release an API to allow trusted third parties to conduct transactions on behalf of the people who deposited Bitcoins in the vault.<p>We wouldn&#x27;t need to worry about hackers, and if the vault is strong enough we wouldn&#x27;t need to worry about thieves.<p>But we would have to worry about the banker. The owner of the vault can devise ways to increase the <i>apparent value</i> of his vault, through financial mechanisms like derivatives and credit default swaps. To prevent this from happening, we could get a big organization with lots of guns and power to regulate the actions of the banker.<p>But then again, the banker controls all your Bitcoins, so he can just use your money to pay off the people with all the guns and power.

Nothing wrong with that.<p>(As for mobile, Intel is getting their lunch eaten by ARM, so I can see why they might want to put more skin in the mobile game.  Although, as I understand it, Intel just sells ARM manufacturers time in their last-gen fabs, thus making ARM cheaper than current-gen Intel stuff, but with not as much raw power.  ARM cores make up for lack of raw power with lots of special functionality on-die, like video decoders and encoders, which your x86 Intel chip will just do in software.)",1393929459

No sane founder would ask their employee to put the startup above their family.<p>A few other tips:<p>- Take 15 minutes to yourself every morning, get a cup of coffee or tea, and read HN.<p>- Listen to industry podcasts on your commute.  I&#x27;m a big fan of ShopTalkShow (front-end dev), This Week In Startups, and Javascript Jabber (between these three I almost always have something to listen to between work and home).<p>- Twice a week (YMMV) wait for the baby and lady to go to bed, then hack for an hour or two. Don&#x27;t do this more than a few times a week though - I used to never go to bed with my fiance (always working), and we started growing distant and fighting more.<p>- Use time at work (especially lunch breaks) to play with new technologies<p>- Help your wife with the baby wherever you can. She put her career completely aside for your child, so she&#x27;ll need to see that you&#x27;re making sacrifices too and giving it 100%.  Your relationship with your partner is invaluable.<p>I&#x27;ll end this list with one final piece of advice: cherish the time you spend with your family, and hold it sacred above all else.<p>I&#x27;m currently in SF doing some contract work with an early-stage startup, about halfway through a 1-month tour. It&#x27;s been harder than I could have imagined; and while I FaceTime with my family every day, the extent to which I miss them every day has really helped remind me what&#x27;s most important.<p>I hope this helps, and if you ever want to talk some more (or hang out, since we&#x27;re both in SF for now), send me an email: address is in my profile.",1393928915
