7339169,comment,7339094,7339094,1,0,SunboX,,,"From the Agavi news list:<p>Hi everyone,<p>We&#x27;re thrilled to announce the immediate availability of Agavi on GitHub!<p>We realize it took much longer than anybody, even ourselves, anticipated. But thanks\nto the hard work of David, Noah and myself with the assistance of Steffen, Thorsten,\nTom and everybody else who provided their support, we finally did it!<p>A big thumbs up goes out to everyone out there for sticking around during that time\nand not abandoning, what we think, is still one of the best PHP frameworks available\ntoday.<p>The present state:<p>There are some immediate effects of the migration:\n - Agavi is now installable via Composer.<p>- Any link to Trac will redirect to corresponding GitHub page. This should work for\n   most old Trac urls, including the wiki, browser and even changesets.\n   Anyone with existing credentials can still login at <a href=""https://trac.agavi.org/login"" rel=""nofollow"">https://trac.agavi.org/login</a>\n   and see the old content while being logged in.<p>- The Subversion repository will stay available for at least 6 months from now in\n   readonly mode. Any changes made to the Git repository will not be reflected in the\n   Subversion repository. For anyone using externals to specific releases we suggest\n   switching to the Subversion bridge on GitHub. For anyone using externals to a\n   specific revision please contact me off list so I can look up the right revision\n   for you to use on the GitHub Subversion bridge (That sadly isn&#x27;t trivial and\n   can&#x27;t be done with a simple mapping).<p>- The tickets and commits mailing lists will be closed. Please use GitHub\n   subscriptions as a replacement.<p>- Travis CI is set up and will test all commits.<p>Roadmap:<p>While this already is a major step forward, there is still more work to do to bring\nAgavi back up to speed. These include:\n - Many small improvements to the surrounding infrastructure (API docs generator\n   update, port documentation to Sphinx, etc)<p>We will start the 1.1 release cycle in 1-2 months from now. The current changelog is\navailable at <a href=""https://github.com/agavi/agavi/blob/master/CHANGELOG"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/agavi/agavi/blob/master/CHANGELOG</a> and we should be\nable to bring even more goodies into the release, including a much better\nauthorization and ACL support, and support for ext/intl in the i18n module.<p>After 1.1 there will be at least one more minor release. Please check\n<a href=""https://github.com/agavi/agavi/issues?milestone=22&state=open"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/agavi/agavi/issues?milestone=22&state=ope...</a> for list of planned\nfeatures. The last 1.x release will be a long term support (LTS) release, which\nwe plan to support for at least 18 months.\nThe plan for 2.0 is not yet finalized but it will be a mostly incremental update\nwith some necessary breaking changes. This includes moving everything to namespaces\nand cleanup of a few unsound spots in the code.<p>Right now we haven&#x27;t completely figured out the new development model for\nbranching and pull requests for permanent contributors.<p>Until we figured the best development model, we invite everyone to start creating\npull requests for master! We will then make sure it ends up in the next bugfix or\nminor release, whichever is applicable.<p>For us, the move to GitHub is just the beginning – we have many plans and ideas to\nadvance Agavi in the future. But we cannot do that without you.<p>Happy forking!<p>Dominik",1393923449

Can anyone suggest problems with the following?<p>A security conscious web developer needs to share credentials with a client. The client isn&#x27;t adept enough to install a crypto tool. They also need something asynchronous like email - a phone call every time is too intrusive. Existing options include:\n1. Email.\n2. A third party service with SSL w/ PFS + server side encryption as an intermediary. A malicious service can keep a copy without detection.<p>With in-browser crypto:\n- Dev asks client to go to http://sendpasswords.com/.\n- Client hits the link. Browser generates a PGP keypair, stores the private key in localStorage and sends the public key to the server. The client is shown a link to send back to the developer.\n- Developer visits link and enters a message which is encrypted with the client&#x27;s public key in browser.\n- Client returns to site. Encrypted message is downloaded and decrypted with key from localStorage.<p>This should be at least as good as either existing option. A few additional security assumptions:\n- Users know to only access the site via an HTTPS URL or HSTS settings are preloaded in their browsers.\n- The HTML + JS is simple, unobsfuscated, static and served in one request; subsequent data from AJAX calls is never executed or loaded as HTML.\n- Only browsers providing a CSRNG are supported.\n- The HTML + JS is open source and audited by a third party.<p>The host would have a hard time capturing cleartext without detection. They could target specific users, but third parties could periodically load the app and verify the checksums to detect any code change that wasn&#x27;t narrowly targeted.<p>So long as the audited code couldn&#x27;t encrypt the message for more than one public key, any interception would be detected when the recipient didn&#x27;t get the message.<p>Thoughts?",1393921933

If you want more speed, there are lots of things to tweak and trim down, but I never <i>felt the need</i>, not even on <i>very cheap netbooks!</i> The only real performance improvements I got by tweaking were from tweaking individual app&#x27;s obscure perf settings (like Matlab or Photoshop).<p>About &quot;just opening a window&quot;: admitedly, windows explorer does very weird things from time to time, but just because you&#x27;re on Windows it doesn&#x27;t mean you have to stick with the default file manager - find one that suits you (and btw, some third party alternatives are actually faster than explorer).<p>Also it&#x27;s a well know fact that some apps have better performance on some OSs than other: Firefox has always been visibly faster on Linux, Opera (the old Presto engine version) has always been visibly faster on Windows etc. Also, since about ~5 versions ago the Firefox devs really got their shit together and got rid of some of what seemed to me like &quot;Windows only memory leaks&quot; and probably did some ui thread optimizations to make things feel more responsive, so the <i>perceived</i> performance feels as if it increased by about ~60% on Windows, even if the actual webpage rendering speed is probably close to the same.<p>Again, it may seem that I&#x27;m a Windows/Microsoft fanboy, but even if feature-wise the Linux DEs are way better, if you compare each feature with its equivalent, you&#x27;ll see that there are zillions of little details that Linux &quot;failed to learn from Windows.&quot; And the current DEs seem to play some stupid iOS/MacOS-copycat-ing game instead of stealing more of the true UI/X innovation that came with Windows 8 for example (and yes, I&#x27;m actually one of the people that love the Win 8 hybrid tablet/desktop gui and apps concept - I just think that Microsoft blew it by over-geeking it, as any kind of &quot;hybrid&quot; UI will appeal mostly to &quot;geeks&quot; and much less to &quot;average joes&quot; that prefers a &quot;one-piece uniform experience&quot;, even if it&#x27;s really suboptimal).",1393920519

So, it&#x27;s as good a templating language as it is a programming language: pretty terrible. I&#x27;ll trade PHP for something as barebones as Python with WSGI + Jinja2 any day.",1393920306

Firefox has always been more responsive on Windows. Its acceleration architecture is still more advanced on Windows. In fact, everything is more responsive and opens faster on Windows. The scheduler is way better for desktop use. Windows never becomes unresponsive for me because of background applications even though I have the scheduler set to prioritise background processes, whereas even quite recently on Linux I have still found compiling or such in the background can lead to X temporarily becoming unresponsive. Windows is certainly leagues more stable than KDE (if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re using). In fact no part of Windows has crashed for me in years.<p>These are just my experiences. I have other problems with Linux on the desktop too mainly relating to GPU stuff. Personally, while I love many aspects of Linux on the desktop and use my Linux VM all the time, I would say I still find the overall experience to be &quot;just deplorable&quot;",1393920132
