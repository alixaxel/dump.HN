While I agree with you that they dropped the support a way too soon, being the reference phone you&#x27;ll have no problems in updating it with CyanogenMod, which is a really good distribution btw.<p>But as a slight counterpoint, given the fast release cycle, you can&#x27;t expect them to support a phone forever. You mentioned iPhones. Well I have an iPhone 3GS. It&#x27;s a perfectly capable phone that still works and that was still sold as the low-price alternative after iPhone 4 happened, yet Apple stopped supporting it as well. But I can understand that, because these OSes get more bloated with stuff and it leads to a shitty experience. I was able to upgrade an older Galaxy S (first generation, shipped originally with 2.1) to 4.3 by means of CyanogenMod and it was unusable due to the less than capable hardware.<p>Google did drop the support too early for the Galaxy Nexus, but try out CyanogenMod. I&#x27;m even thinking of installing it on my Nexus 4 because the Android on this device is bloated with Google-stuff that I cannot uninstall and it pisses me off. It&#x27;s also enlightening to install CyanogenMod without Google Play, for an all open-source experience ;-)",1410846999

8323212,comment,8321940,8322924,6,0,sillysaurus3,,,"It&#x27;s hard to understand how such an error could occur.  Due to the nature of the floating point format, it seems very difficult for a bug to transform 1.0 into 0.999999.<p>Floating point 1.0 has a sign bit of 0, an exponent of 0 (after bias), and a significand of 1.0.  It&#x27;s hard to imagine a sequence of transformations that could somehow result in getting 0.999999999 after conversion.<p>I made a little &quot;floating point binary explorer&quot;: <a href=""http://ideone.com/61L4V6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideone.com/61L4V6</a>  (Apologies for the awful code quality; it&#x27;s just a quick hack.)  It prints each bit of a 32-bit float, which for 1.0 is &quot;00111111 10000000 00000000 00000000&quot;.<p>The first bit is the sign bit, the next 8 bits are the exponent, and the remaining 23 bits are the significand. So, sign=0, exponent=127, significand=0.  The significand is actually 24-bit, not 23, and the leading &quot;hidden bit&quot; is always 1 (nitpick: unless the floating point value is 0.0 or -0.0).  That means the significand in this case isn&#x27;t actually zero, but &quot;1 followed by 23 zeroes,&quot; so it&#x27;s 2^24.<p>The final value for a 32-bit float is:<p><pre><code>  (significand / 2^24) * 2^(exponent - 127)\n</code></pre>\nThat comes out to (2^24 / 2^24) * 2^(127 - 127), which is 1.0 * 2^0 which equals 1.0.<p>For representing 2.0, everything is exactly the same, except the encoded exponent is 128 instead of 127.   That comes out to (2^24 / 2^24) * 2^(128 - 127), or 1.0 * 2^1 which equals 2.0.<p>Shader programs often use half precision floats (16-bit total, with 1 bit for sign, 5 bits for exponent, and 10 for significand) but the concepts should be exactly the same.  1.0 and 2.0 should always be 1.0 * 2^0 and 1.0 * 2^1 respectively, regardless of whether we&#x27;re using half/single/double precision.<p>I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out how your program wound up with 0.999999, even if there was a bug in the conversion.  32-bit floating point 0.999999 is &quot;00111111 01111111 11111111 11101111&quot; which is very different from the binary 1.0 float value: <a href=""http://ideone.com/Qlqu4W"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ideone.com/Qlqu4W</a>  It has an exponent of 126 and almost the highest possible significand, which comes out to 1.9999 * 2^(126 - 127) = 1.9999 * 2^-1 = 0.9999.<p>So in order for 1.0 to be erroneously transformed into 0.9999, the bug would need to invert all the bits of the significand, but subtract 1 from the exponent.<p>Is there anything in particular that I should watch out for on the A7 GPU?  I was just hoping to hear about any details you may have left out for simplicity, or any other factors that could&#x27;ve triggered the bug.<p><i>> Even on desktop machines, I had similar problems with large sets of tests that would produce different results depending on which (modern desktop) processor they ran on.<p>> Lesson: floating point is certainly dangerous for consistent representations that &quot;matter&quot;. Regardless of a compiler decision or what the spec says.</i><p>Are there floating point bugs on desktop processors?  The only one I&#x27;ve heard of was the infamous Pentium FDIV bug <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug</a> and the only reason that wasn&#x27;t hotfixed to match the spec was because the logic was hardwired into the chip rather than implemented in microcode, making a patch impossible.<p>It seems like any deviation from the floating point standard in a modern desktop CPU would be noticed almost immediately, because there is a lot of code which relies on the exact IEEE floating point standard in order to function properly.  There was recently a hash algorithm featured on HN which used floating point, and the only reason such an algorithm can be trusted is if every desktop processor properly adheres to the spec.",1410845942

You can quibble over semantics and say that the middle ages includes the dark ages, but that obscures the point of the original post.<p>The standard narrative of Western intellectual progress looks like this:<p>~300BC to ~400AD: classical civilisation, high intellectual culture<p>~400AD to ~1500AD: Europe under the dominion of the Church, science and reason suppressed<p>~1500AD: bam, Renaissance<p>~1700AD: bam, Enlightenment<p>~1700AD - present: humanity freed from the yoke of religion, knowledge flowers again.<p>The revisionist view is as follows:<p>~300BC to ~400AD: classical civilisation, high intellectual culture<p>~400AD to ~1000AD: Europe in the dark ages due to barbarian invasions, underpopulated and poor, classical tradition barely kept alive in monasteries<p>~1000AD to ~1400AD: Europe begins to get wealthier, knowledge flowers in Church-sponsored universities<p>~1600AD: bam, Protestant Reformation<p>~1600AD - present: science builds on knowledge and philosophy developed by Catholic church, but Protestant anti-Catholic propaganda creates the false narrative of Church suppression of knowledge.<p>I don&#x27;t know why this perspective is hitting the zeitgeist now, but one reason might be that the internet enables niche communities to share such ideas.<p>One such group is Catholics - here&#x27;s a Catholic blogger explaining exactly how the heliocentrism vs geocentrism debate played out: <a href=""http://tofspot.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-great-ptolemaic-smackdown.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tofspot.blogspot.com/2013/08/the-great-ptolemaic-smac...</a><p>Another group are environmentalists - here&#x27;s an interesting blogger writing about how classical knowledge was preserved through the dark ages: <a href=""http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com.au/2010/06/merlins-time.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thearchdruidreport.blogspot.com.au/2010/06/merlins-ti...</a><p>And a final group are the reactionaries, a group who see the modern ideals of progress as a myth - here&#x27;s a good starting point on the idea that modern &#x27;progressive&#x27; ideas are largely derived from Protestantism: <a href=""http://unqualifiedreservations.wordpress.com/2007/09/26/how-dawkins-got-pwned-part-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unqualifiedreservations.wordpress.com/2007/09/26/how-...</a><p>Anyone who&#x27;s interested and has the free time, please do dig around those blogs - you may realise, as I did, that the 21st century is quite an intellectually narrow and ignorant time.",1410845226

8323178,comment,8320968,8323075,0,0,dbaupp,,,"I don&#x27;t think copy elision[1,2] means what you think it means, it simply allows the compiler to avoid e.g. allocating a new string when returning a string, or avoid allocating a new string to store the result of a temporary. That is, copy elision allows<p><pre><code>   std::string str = data.substr(2, 3);
   return str;
</code></pre>
to only allocate one new string (for the return value of substr), instead of two. There&#x27;s no way the compiler can get out of constructing at least one std::string for the return value, especially if there&#x27;s any form of dynamic substr&#x27;ing (e.g. parsing a CSV file with columns that aren&#x27;t all the same width).<p>Sharing is only multithreading unfriendly if there&#x27;s modification happening, and modification of textual (i.e. Unicode) data is bad practice and hard to get right, since all Unicode encodings are variable width (yes, even UTF-32, it is a variable width encoding of visible characters).<p>Furthermore, a string_view is <i>strictly</i> better than a string for many applications, since a string_view can always be copied into a string by the caller if necessary (i.e. each function can choose to return the most sensible/most performant thing, which is a string_view if it&#x27;s just a substring of one of the arguments).<p>The only sensible argument against string_view in C++ I know is: it&#x27;s easy to get dangling references. Which is correct, but that&#x27;s a general problem with C++ itself, not with the idea of string views (Rust has a perfectly safe version in the form of &str, which cannot become dangling like in C++).<p><i>> Keep in mind that on a 64-bit architecture a view is at least 16 bytes large and that small strings can be copied to the stack resulting in better locality and reduced memory usage.</i><p>No, a string_view points into memory that already exists, there&#x27;s no increased memory usage; a small string copied on to the stack will be part of the string struct, which is at least 3 * 8 = 24 bytes: a pointer, the length and the capacity. Also, a memcpy out of the original string is always going to be more expensive than just getting the pointer/length (or pair of pointers) for a string_view, since the memcpy has to do this anyway.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_elision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_elision</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://definedbehavior.blogspot.com/2011/08/value-semantics-copy-elision.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://definedbehavior.blogspot.com/2011/08/value-semantics-...</a>",1410844836
