8365951,comment,8364565,8365494,2,0,URSpider94,,,"IANAL, so corrections are welcome, but my understanding is this:<p>To bring a civil suit against another party, you must have standing, which means you must be able to show that you, personally, suffered damage at the hand of the other party. These 22 people can&#x27;t just sue Google for damages on behalf of everyone whose data was allegedly hoovered up by StreetView, they have to prove that their data was collected. If they can&#x27;t, then other people could bring the same suit and look for their data in the evidence as well.<p>Once a defendant or defendants prove that they have standing to bring the case, they could then petition the judge to certify a class action, at which point the lawyers representing the class would ask for discovery to find and notify all the other class members.<p>I view this as a very valuable rule of law; without this, there are attorneys who would just spend all day filing speculative lawsuits in hopes of forming a class action.<p>One other notable places this rule has come into play in the recent past: in litigation around gay marriage, when the government refused to defend its marriage discrimination laws, religious groups tried to step in to take on the defense, only to be told they had no standing because they were not being harmed by other people getting married.",1411628081

And does it provide significant benefits over languages that already exist?&quot;<p>One reason may be that large companies want <i>ownership</i> of a modern, C#/Java/Go-like language [1]. I was an intern at Adobe when it was trying to develop such a language (ActionScript 4) + VM, and a primary reason not to adopt an existing language is that they wanted control and to be free of legacy baggage as much as possible. Obj-C is reasonable to use today, but its C and Smalltalk underpinnings sometimes feel like anachronisms for people writing App Store apps. This is probably especially true if you&#x27;re a language designer like Chris Lattner at Apple and are tasked with fixing the most prominent pain points that your language users face.<p>[1] I realize these are somewhat diverse languages.",1411627710

8365897,comment,8365448,8365448,0,0,PieSquared,,,"As he predicted, I was with him until his rant about generics. While the example he makes support his point, that&#x27;s nothing specific to <i>generics</i> but instead to the implementation of generics. For example, he uses the following example as &quot;bad&quot; generics:<p><pre><code>    func reverse<C : CollectionType where C.Index : BidirectionalIndexType>(source: C) -> [C.Generator.Element]
</code></pre>
and the following example as &quot;good&quot; non-generics:<p><pre><code>    func reverse(source: CollectionType) -> CollectionType
</code></pre>
However, you can have equally clean syntax <i>with</i> generics. For example, consider the hypothetical syntax:<p><pre><code>    func reverse(source: CollectionType[a]) -> CollectionType[a]
</code></pre>
in which `CollectionType` is parameterized by the type variable `a` [0].<p>I also take issue with the idea that removing static checks isn&#x27;t a big penalty. In particular, I cringe a little at the following sentence<p>> Because it does not actually matter. If an Int gets in my array, it’s because I screwed up and likely had very poor testing around the scenario to begin with.<p>The benefits of static typing is that you don&#x27;t <i>need</i> testing of things like that. The compiler guarantees safety, allowing you to avoid writing test case that are mundane and boring, such as checking that you don&#x27;t put an Int into a String array.<p>The following paragraph also seemed questionable to me:<p>> Yes, in this example, I’ve moved the validation from compile-time to runtime. But you know what, that’s likely where many of these types of errors are going to be coming from to begin with because the content of the array is being filled in with dynamic content getting coerced into your given type at runtime from dynamic input sources, not from a set of code statements appending items to your arrays.<p>I think this is somewhat incorrect. You should never just be type-casting your inputs. (In fact, I think it should ideally be impossible to do so without the compiler generating really big flashing warnings saying &quot;THIS IS DANGEROUS!&quot;). The static verification here will prevent you from doing silly things, and should ideally force you to do input validation at the location of input, instead of blindly casting things to the type it needs.<p>All in all, not a bad discussion, but I think that this piece demonstrates that bad implementations of static typing can severely detract from the good qualities of static typing, and that it takes some getting used to to program well in a statically typed language (not casting things spuriously is a good example of that). That said, I know very little about Swift, so take all of this with a grain of salt.<p>[0] It may at this point be clear that the inspiration here is Haskell and ML; I am a big proponent of these languages, and believe that static typing can eliminate many common errors.",1411626541

Experimental: If it was your first space mission, you wouldn&#x27;t exactly load it with gadgets. Missions have a chance to succeed or to end in failure.

Excellent display, good but not awesome battery life, fast hardware and really good keyboard for its size. I&#x27;ve bought two UX31A&#x27;s, one for myself almost two years a go and one for my dad last Christmas. Everything else works straight away with Ubuntu other than ambient light sensor. I think there isn&#x27;t any workarounds for that.<p>I got Lenovo X1 Carbon (2014, Touch) from work couple months ago and while it has better CPU, bigger SSD, more RAM and better GPU than my two year old Zenbook, it&#x27;s just worse. The Zenbook lid can be opened with one hand, Lenovo requires both hands. Lenovo has too heavy display and too light keyboard part combined with too tight hinges, so when trying to open the lid with one hand, the whole computer lifts up from the table.<p>Also, Zenbooks have normal keyboards. I hate the keyboard on X1 Carbon. Instead of normal function keys, there&#x27;s  are adaptive touch keyboard thingy that tries to figure out what kind of special buttons should be shown in there with each program, but it just fails. And feels like... well it does not have real buttons, so I can&#x27;t feel a thing while using it.<p>Also, delete button is in the upper right corner in X1 Carbon. And backspace is on the left hand side of it. And that makes no sense. Backspace is used way more often than delete, so it should be easier to hit. And upper right corner is easier to hit than almost upper right corner.<p>And Zenbooks have normal arrow keys that are not too crowded. Lenovo decided to put page up and down right next to up arrow. When ever I accidentally hit page up or down instead of up arrow, I feel like I&#x27;m totally lost.<p>And almost forgot, Zenbooks have good touch pads, X1 Carbon touch pad moves up and down, so it&#x27;s like a huge button. Really annoying when you just move your thumb on it and accidentally press too hard, so it registers a mouse click even tough you did not raise your finger.<p>So, in short Asus Zenbook UX* laptops pack awesome hardware, work with Linux pretty much perfectly and have really good build quality.",1411625774

8365845,comment,8342697,8342697,0,0,Nzen,,,"tl;dr Game programmers do lots of memory allocations that C/C++ don&#x27;t accommodate in a pleasing way. New languages (Go D Rust) have smaller ball&chains but reflect different audiences that can, for example, eat the garbage compiler or pointer safety.<p>Blow suggests that the game industry should devote resources to a DSL that emphasizes their needs. Rather than, say, make the programmer allocate a block and then fill it with sizeof(x) offsets & allocating index arrays, the hypothetical language, when so marked, ought to allocate and fill a struct&#x27;s members contiguously.<p>There&#x27;s plenty more in the two hour video.

It&#x27;d be a horrible precedent to privatize beaches, since the profit motive would provide incentive slowly sell them away until normal people would lose access to a very valuable recreational area for swimming, exploring, and hanging out in a public space just so a few rich pricks could enjoy the space without all the rabble.  Give wealthy people an inch and they&#x27;ll buy a mile.<p>Also, the surfers would beat anyone senseless who tried that crap, so it&#x27;s a pointless debate.",1411625270

From the bottom of my heart: writing native apps is far more enjoyable and productive at the moment.<p>With the browser engine underneath, you get nice benefits in text layouting, image handling and some inputs, but it requires a lot of work to get good performance, to get touch interaction and scrolling feel natural, to make transition animations to work well. Offline access is also PITA if you have a lot of data - indexedDB crashes left and right if not used carefully. The last 20% of the app takes 800% of the time :) and the result is still not what you wanted.<p>I haven&#x27;t encountered many good mobile web apps. HN app by @premii is pretty good (<a href=""http://hn.premii.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hn.premii.com/</a>), and the developer once described here in HN that he didn&#x27;t use any JS library like jQuery for performance reasons, everything had to be coded manually.",1411625042

This was a known issue and responsible disclosure was exercised -- the issue didn&#x27;t become public until 5 minutes after the embargo was lifted (i.e., 5 minutes after it was agreed the issue and patch would go public). Since it&#x27;s so easy to exploit this bug, it&#x27;d be impossible to release a patch without people taking notice and immediately beginning to exploit vulnerable systems.<p>Someone just did a really bad job vetting the patch for thoroughness.",1411624953
