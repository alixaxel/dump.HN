It means that you can sign with a private key and verify with a public key.<p>For instance Google, sign every JWT with the same private secret and publish their key for verification [1]. If you use this, your server-side application not only needs to verify that the JWT signature is correct but also that the audience is your application.<p>I wrote an example middleware for connect to verify Google&#x27;s JWTs [2].<p>[1]: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login#validatinganidtoken"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2Login#vali...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.npmjs.org/package/connect-google-jwt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.npmjs.org/package/connect-google-jwt</a>",1410177474

8284221,comment,8282373,8284106,1,0,anon4,,,"What? Your comment is pure nonsense. Of course you can prove that striking a match causes it to ignite. There&#x27;s a long chain of events, each of which trivially physically verifiable, which starts with you moving the match head while applying a given amount of pressure against the material lining the matchbox, which then, due to friction, flakes off (both head and lining), the two react together to produce a spark and a flame starts. You can cut the chain down to micro-events and you&#x27;ll find each one to be consistently verifiable.<p>Or do an experiment - grab a mug and lift it. I claim that your arm motion while your hand had grabbed the mug caused it to ascend. We can again examine the basic physical events, cutting them as fine as you&#x27;d like, and we&#x27;ll see that it really was you with your arm, who caused the mug to ascend.<p>This is a cause-and-effect link -- when you can show how event A lead to event B via a chain of events, each of which directly causes the next. At the least you need to show that there is a sensible progression from the cause to the effect, in order to claim a causation.<p>Correlation on the other hand is a description of past observations. You can observe that each time it snows people increase their energy expenditure in order to heat their homes. Does the increase in heating cause the snow? That doesn&#x27;t seem likely, knowing how heating works. It could be that increased energy demands leads to more coal being burned, leading to larger clouds being formed and lowering the outside temperature. However, even though increased coal burning does lead to such effects, they&#x27;re pretty small from just increased heating, so we can discount this hypothesis. On the other hand, you can show that cold weather causes snow. Water that falls in cold air crystallises and becomes snow. So there is a definite causative relationship between cold weather and snow. Could there also be a causative relationship between cold weather and heating? Well, assuming that people wish to live at a constant surrounding air temperature of about 20-30 degrees, that seems very likely. There are of course individuals who don&#x27;t fit that profile, but they are very few (I can&#x27;t actually provide a study which supports that claim, but just assume it for the purposes of this demonstration). In the end, we can say that while snow and heating are correlated, heating does not cause snow. They simply have a common cause - cold weather.<p>And finally, if you keep your home at a constant temperature, the setting on your heater does not correlate with the temperature inside your home, because the temperature is constant, while you have to change the setting up and down to counteract the more or less cold weather outside. It does correlate perfectly with the outside temperature, but I&#x27;ll leave proving that putting your heater on high doesn&#x27;t make the temperature outside drop by 10 degrees as an exercise.",1410176046

It also puts me at 0 Lat/0 Long a few times, but the reason for this is pretty obvious, just confusing when I first saw it mapped.

8284190,comment,8283006,8283530,16,0,jfroma,,,"Yes, it is a bad UX that the session expire randomly and how to handle this is a whole subject per se.<p>Here are my two cents:<p>- Web Apps: If you set an expiration of 1 week, do not use the token for 1 week. Use it for a day and then use the token to get a new token. This way every time your user uses the application, he gets one extra week logged in.  This is not different than the normal concept of session and cookies.<p>If the user does not use your application for a week, next time he go to your app, he will have to login again and this is fine and widely accepted.<p>- For Mobile/Native Apps: you can use the same explained above, but that&#x27;s not how most of the mobile applications work these days, I can open facebook after a month without using it and I&#x27;m sure I will not need to login again. One way you can do this is to use a refresh token that never expires to fetch a JWT that does expires. The problem with a token that never expires is that it never expires, what happen if your phone is stolen?. In my opinion, there must be a clear and easy interface where the user can revoke these tokens but looking at random alphanumeric characters wont help, so the best practice will be to show something like &quot;Revoke access on John&#x27;s IPad&quot; this means that the refresh token must be requested for an specific device name.<p>Certain events can trigger things, if you lost your wallet (at least in Argentina), first thing you do is to call the bank to disable your credit cards. If you forget your laptop in a friend&#x27;s house and you don&#x27;t want then to read your Facebook you will probably change your password. Changing the password is usually a good event to<p>1. Revoke all refresh tokens (for native apps)<p>2. Anchor the &quot;iss&quot; date for JWTs, this means that tokens issued before the last password change are not longer valid.<p>Because changing the password can have other purposes, you can also put a prominent button in your UI: &quot;Close session on all browsers and devices&quot;, this will delete all refresh token and store the timestamp to check against the JWTs.<p>We might write a blog post soon about this on Auth0&#x27;s blog: <a href=""https://auth0.com/blog"" rel=""nofollow"">https://auth0.com/blog</a>.",1410175407

Up to 1/3 of the time on the river when he has nothing, more when he has a draw before the river card, and almost always with a strong draw.<p>There is no way to exploit this kind of strategy because as long as you&#x27;re not bluffing every time (remember, he still has it 2/3 of the time or gets there before the river) you have to consider that he&#x27;s not bluffing sometimes.<p>I guess the business analogy is that a founder will bluff more often if he knows there is a lot of real potential.",1410174785

If you want to prove functional properties of programs written in the input language with respect to CompCert&#x27;s definition, you will probably have to define Hoare-Floyd-style axiomatic semantics and then prove that this definition is equivalent to the operational semantics definition.<p>An informal version of this proof for a toy language already exists in good textbooks (for instance Winskel&#x27;s The Formal Semantics of Programming Languages). It is just a matter of scaling up to C and scaling down to the formally verified level.<p>I should also point out that there is an ongoing research project that takes the same approach, with “Abstract-interpretation-based static analysis” instead of “verification of functional properties”: <a href=""http://verasco.imag.fr/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://verasco.imag.fr/wiki/Main_Page</a>",1410174411

E.g.<p>- implementing getters/setters: just make the thing public, the whole private/public bullshit is too shallow<p>- implementing methods: inheritance is normally used with caution and is just a small part of your application (e.g. a core that uses it); you will think about getting this abstraction right (your inheritance tree) and the time it needs typing the text to implement the methods is often small in comparison to the thinking over inheritance.<p>- completion: IMHO there are different modes you are in, while coding: (0) prototyping (researching the problem, reading API documentation) and (1) implementing a robust solution; In the first case, again, the time it takes you is more constrained by the thinking you do, and in the second case you probably know the API and important functions already (from the previous step) so the auto-complete is not needed anymore.<p>The coolest thing is the renaming which really might help you tackle one of the hardest CS things (naming things). Furthermore I would not use the Shape example as it is too far fetched from reality. It&#x27;s like the &quot;let&#x27;s implement fibonacci numbers&quot; in the FP world.

Northern Ireland&#x27;s Gaelic culture is historically related to Isle of Mann and Northwest Scotland&#x27;s Gaelic cultures. At certain points in history the spoken dialects, kinships and such were closer between these regions then they were between Northern Ireland and other parts of Ireland. Dublin was a Gaelic-Viking town, later a Anglo-Irish-Norman town.<p>During the 16th-18th centuries, &quot;The Plantations&quot; there was a lot of migration of Loyalists from the Scottish Lowland.

There are mountains of historical threads, cultural similarities. The Highland clan system is related to the Northern Irish system. There was trade dating back to prehistoric times.<p>When Irish Nationalism was on the rise, strongly Republican and strongly Catholic, these people developed their own Unionist political identity.<p>The whole thing is predicated on being in the United Kingdom.
