If an Int gets in my array, it’s because I screwed up and likely had very poor testing around the scenario to begin with.<p>>The benefits of static typing is that you don&#x27;t need testing of things like that. The compiler guarantees safety, allowing you to avoid writing test case that are mundane and boring, such as checking that you don&#x27;t put an Int into a String array.<p>This is a canard.  You hardly ever (within an epsilon of &quot;never&quot;) write tests for types.  You write tests for values that you expect, which the type-system doesn&#x27;t guarantee.  Those values have types, so those get tested as a side effect without any additional effort.",1411635117

CPU mining is very uncompetitive.  A CPU miner is upper bounded at about 100 mega-hash per second (100 * 10^6 hashes) and more typically closer to 5 * 10^6.  100 megahash per second is worth approximately two cents per month.  My off-the-cuff estimate for AmaGooBookSoft is 300k servers, which gets you about $6k a month or $200 a day if you rooted <i>all</i> of them <i>and</i> they were the most effective CPUs ever reported for mining Bitcoin.<p>The far more likely way for this bug resulting in someone exfiltrating lots of bitcoins is them hitting every Bitcoin exchange looking for e.g. cPanel on a development box, Wordpress hosted on Nginx with fastcgi, etc etc.  If they find one, they&#x27;ve got the hot wallet inside of five minutes later if it is on the same box, a bit more if it is somewhere else on the local network.<p>(I&#x27;ve got to admit, the first thing I did after patching my boxes, to relax about the stress, was grepping Bitcoin Core for system calls.  No obvious ones that I could see, for what it is worth.)<p>If I can emphasize again, though: just because you don&#x27;t engage in risky behaviors like e.g. transacting in bitcoins, doesn&#x27;t mean your boxes are safe.
