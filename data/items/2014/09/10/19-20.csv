Nobody goes and touts their products or services actual advantages, or even goes so far as simply saying they&#x27;re the &quot;best&quot;. Best would matter to customers.

Once that number is exceeded, the options are set the animals free or find humane ways to control the population. Depending on where you live, setting them free could be a good option or it could be terrible. If the animals have no survival instinct left, they will be left alone to starve to death or die from sickness. In the city, they may be hit by cars, or they might attack other pets. They might even make other pets sick by biting them. They can easily become a nuisance in populated areas, although rural areas have a larger domain for stray animals.<p>There&#x27;s no one walking into your house saying &quot;there&#x27;s too many pets in the world&quot; and shooting Lassie. They only get put down when there is no one left to take care of them.<p>If you think it&#x27;s arbitrary, why don&#x27;t you adopt every homeless pet?

I certainly wouldn&#x27;t have completed it without evidence there were interesting jobs the other side if it wasn&#x27;t posted here; by the tenth question about whether I found it easy to read others&#x27; emotions I think even a really bad human recruiter would have taken the hint. Even accounting for the need to rephrase questions to check for consistency and some of those questions on basic empathy selecting for reliance on visual cues, there were too many. There aren&#x27;t many salespeople who are going to honestly acknowledge an actual weakness in social skills in a system designed to rank their sales ability anyway (and similarly even serial liars like to create the impression they&#x27;re generally truthful...except perhaps when asked about the lengths they&#x27;ll go to for a sale).<p>On the other hand the sales questions, which seemed to be fewer in number and much better, seemed to miss some of the absolute classics in understanding salespeople&#x27;s approaches like &quot;salespeople should always be closing&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m best when focused on reaching as many new customers as possible&quot;, &quot;understanding the customer is mostly about social skills&quot;.<p>For that matter, I&#x27;m still trying to work out why the eventual output scored me lowest for &quot;analytical skills&quot; (there&#x27;s a joke in there somewhere...) but I think that reflects the balance of questions asked more than my actual relative weaknesses.<p>I actually think the idea has a lot of potential: there are vast differences in sales environments, often very poorly communicated by the actual ads, and usually vast numbers of salespeople with similarly disparate skillsets and homogenous CVs. But the questions could use some work.<p>Unrelated whinges: I don&#x27;t particularly like or trust LinkedIn social signup even though I can understand why you&#x27;d use it (and contrary to popular belief there are good salespeople that don&#x27;t use LinkedIn). I particularly don&#x27;t like giving LinkedIn details to you and then having to create an imaginary North American address and zip code to continue the process, even though theoretically I could be willing to relocate a lot further than 150 miles, and many sales positions are remote...",1410378088

It makes the expression of complex generated hardware easier (because it&#x27;s Python), but the workaday circuit level stuff ends up even cruftier-looking than VHDL.  And the simulation backend seems like mostly a toy.  Chisel is sort of the same thing, but based on Scala, and has a lot of the same issues IMHO.<p>Honestly I wonder if all these &quot;open source HDLs aimed at hackers&quot; projects are simply trying to do too much and what the world really needs is just a cleaner Verilog with the synthesis and simulation environments more strictly separated...<p>Also: what editor thought that the best way to represent code examples was as an unreadably small app screenshot followed by helpful &quot;bigger image&quot; and (sigh) &quot;view this code on github&quot; links?",1410375999
