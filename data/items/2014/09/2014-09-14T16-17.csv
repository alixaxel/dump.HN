You want someone to handle business, support, etc. People who can do that are a dime a dozen.<p>That could be another student at the university; someone with an active Twitter account, good charisma, etc. Offer 25% equity vesting over 4 years. That&#x27;s pretty generous. Keep hacking and plugging, and do as much or as little of the interacting as you want. If the other person doesn&#x27;t carry their weight -- which is not uncommon -- dump them or swap them out for someone else. Be very upfront about this when bringing them on (if you want, overly upfront -- pitch this as a short-term engagement, with possibility of going longer depending on how business goes).<p>Give yourself the title of CEO and CTO. Give them the title interrim president+COO.<p>Regarding depression, social anxiety, etc., this can help fix it. I&#x27;ve been there. Depression gets better when you have meaning and purpose, and when you&#x27;re busy enough to not have time worrying about it. Social anxiety gets better with status. When people are competing to talk to you (rather than the other way around), and you&#x27;re in a position to say yes or no, the dynamic is just different. If this were to grow into a successful company, you might be in a very different position. You&#x27;ve been playing with fixing this for a while.

8315591,comment,8313324,8313324,1,0,nlh,,,"Just a commentary on the bigger picture:  I strongly disagree with the notion that talking on the phone while driving is always bad (yes, I know, some people are particularly bad at it and shouldn&#x27;t do it, but those people probably shouldn&#x27;t be talking at all or...in many cases...driving at all.)<p>But texting while driving is <i>really bad</i>.  I&#x27;ve done it far too much, and every single time I note how totally distracted, worse-performing, and basically crappy I am at the driving part (and I am a good driver when not distracted).<p>Why did I do it?  Because for better or for worse, some people have gotten so used to this world of instant communications that if you don&#x27;t reply quickly enough, they actually get concerned -- &quot;why aren&#x27;t you answering me?  is everything ok?&quot;<p>So my solution is twofold:  1.  I&#x27;ve stopped responding to people so quickly.  And if they protest, I explain:  I was driving.  Chill out.  I&#x27;m fine.  Everything is fine.  2.  And if it really can&#x27;t wait, I just make a call.  &quot;I&#x27;m driving - don&#x27;t want to text.

8315588,comment,8315171,8315440,3,0,kavabean,,,"OK. Yes the framers of the constitution did create protections from the government for themselves, and shared that with the rest of the population. As you imply it is hard to know if the general case was a side-effect or original intent.<p>At the same time they purposefully sought to disenfranchise the majority so that they might change the rules at any time.<p>So the constitution within the constitution is that the government will protect the wealthy, and that makes sense given who was writing it.<p>It appears that the ruling elites now value control of the population over privacy. I see two possible explanations but perhaps there are others.<p>* They see the incredible growth of poverty in the US and there is no vast neighboring region in which to exterminate existing inhabitants and settle. Hence wealth protection from the masses is a higher priority than the privacy protections.<p>* Mass media has distorted the scale of the disenfranchising effects of our system (rich have more control and poor even less) and the wealthy realise they can use their control of the government to make huge fortunes. For example the profits of the banks are derived by transfer of wealth from taxpayers through implicit insurance since insurance allows highly profitable high risk strategies. They then choose short term profits over privacy / human rights.<p>In any case they choose to exercise their rights under the constitution within the constitution to change the laws to bring about repression and control.<p>I&#x27;m not really rebutting your point here. Instead I want to highlight that what is happening now IS consistent with the ideals of governance around during the formation of the US and what has changed is likely a lower level &#x27;priority&#x27;",1410713587

8315585,comment,8313499,8315336,1,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"You seem to be implying an either-or choice where one does not exist. Of course we should evaluate the results of our actions. And of course that information should be used next time.<p>What we can&#x27;t do is somehow try to add it all up after the fact to figure out if it was worth it or not. At the time we make decisions based on what we know and who we are. It&#x27;s our embrace of our uncertainty of knowledge yet courage to make what we feel our moral choices anyway that is noble. The author seemed to try to be figuring out if what he did was the right thing or not. That&#x27;s whacked. Instead, the question is whether, knowing what he did then, he was authentic to who he was.<p>Let&#x27;s try this a different way. You could replay the exact same article with three different conclusions. The kid could have escaped poverty and went on to law school. The kid could have been a farce made up by the religious guy. The kid could have spent all the money on drugs. Who cares? If you care about Haiti and the larger situation, it&#x27;s all anecdotal anyway. If you don&#x27;t care about the larger situation, then this story is just about the unique and personal experiences each of the participants has. There is no larger story. So all of this other stuff about the macro situation is just a form of projection the author is experiencing while trying to make sense of his own experience. That&#x27;s fine -- as long as he understands it. But in the end it&#x27;s just a framing technique.<p>The personal story was the author trying to figure out if things he had no idea about -- what was actually happening with his money -- were important to the decisions and feelings he had about his own religion during his teen years. It&#x27;s almost like he was an observer of his own life. \nThere&#x27;s a strange disconnect.<p>What was really going on, for both he and the kid, was that they were taking a big piece of fuzzy, unfortunate, and difficult life situation and making hard choices about what to do. The kid stays with his family. He doesn&#x27;t stand out, stays with the herd. The author still sends money, but is unsure why, except to say that would have been even worse. Then he realizes that he&#x27;s so involved that he has to know what&#x27;s been going on. Why the change of heart? I&#x27;m not exactly sure. Is he really worried about evangelizing kids? Also, I left the article not really being sure. The most important part of the story, the decisions he made, is the foggiest. He walks right by the most important part of all of this, his own values, and instead waves his hands around at the preacher, the county, the NGO, dumb westerners, and so on. Then he continues to give! It&#x27;s like he does these things and doesn&#x27;t know why.<p>In my mind these choices are where the real story is, not trying to piece it all together into some kind of uber narrative about Haiti (or religious NGOs) in general (which would also be a good story.)",1410713545

The men and women of our military fulfilled that wish: at the cost of $20 billion a year, they delivered to us most of the globe on a silver platter, completely electronically dominated and ready to be watched to stop even a whiff of such a threat.<p>That our social demands (in aggregate) are childish, insane, bipolar, etc isn&#x27;t their fault. They simply did what society demanded it needed to feel safe, what they saw as their duty.<p>The simple truth is that the current state of affairs is exactly what we&#x27;ve asked for, in large part, and that the most realistic way to reform it is to engage with other citizens and help them understand why their contrary and silly demands are contrary and silly.<p>All that pulling away from the political exchange will do is lead us down the path of a civil war (or other turmoil) as people who refuse to be part of the rule making also refuse to follow the rules.",1410711398

I have a piece of freemium software that has been downloaded about 700,000 times and here is what i did to manage the emails:<p>- set up a great FAQ and put all questions that are asked more than once in there.\n- if you use a mac get a copy of TextExpander ( or a similar product) and automate all your email replies.  Then you can answer support emails with one command.\n- use a Gmail label to sort out support, and batch send emails once or twice a week.
