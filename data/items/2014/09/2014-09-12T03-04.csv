However, if you&#x27;re a light user and just want something that works you can always choose based on price. It&#x27;s really not that hard.<p>&quot;With the iPhone I&#x27;m now forced to regret the decision either way.&quot;\nBut are you though? Let&#x27;s imagine for a second that the iPhone 6+ didn&#x27;t exist. Is the iPhone 6 enough of an upgrade for you to want it? The obvious upgrade path is iPhone 5 to iPhone 6, if you&#x27;ve never wanted a phablet then the iPhone 6+ is not for you. There, I made your decision for you.",1410494381

8306499,comment,8305283,8305653,8,0,halfcat,,,"This can not be stressed strongly enough. There is never a case when RAID5 is the best choice, ever [1]. There are cases where RAID0 is mathematically proven more reliable than RAID5 [2]. RAID5 should never be used for anything where you value keeping your data. I am not exaggerating when I say that very often, your data is safer on a single hard drive than it is on a RAID5 array. Please let that sink in.<p>The problem is that once a drive fails, during the rebuild, if any of the surviving drives experience an unrecoverable read error (URE), the entire array will fail. On consumer-grade SATA drives that have a URE rate of 1 in 10^14, that means if the data on the surviving drives totals 12TB, the probability of the array failing rebuild is close to 100%. Enterprise SAS drives are typically rated 1 URE in 10^15, so you improve your chances ten-fold. Still an avoidable risk.<p>RAID6 suffers from the same fundamental flaw as RAID5, but the probability of complete array failure is pushed back one level, making RAID6 with enterprise SAS drives possibly acceptable in some cases, for now (until hard drive capacities get larger).<p>I no longer use parity RAID. Always RAID10 [3]. If a customer insists on RAID5, I tell them they can hire someone else, and I am prepared to walk away.<p>I haven&#x27;t even touched on the ridiculous cases where it takes RAID5 arrays weeks or months to rebuild, while an entire company limps inefficiently along. When productivity suffers company-wide, the decision makers wish they had paid the tiny price for a few extra disks to do RAID10.<p>In the article, he has 12x 4TB drives. Once two drives failed, assuming he is using enterprise drives (Dell calls them &quot;near-line SAS&quot;, just an enterprise SATA), there is a 33% chance the entire array fails if he tries to rebuild. If the drives are plain SATA, there is almost no chance the array completes a rebuild.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.smbitjournal.com/2012/11/choosing-a-raid-level-by-drive-count/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smbitjournal.com/2012/11/choosing-a-raid-level-by...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.smbitjournal.com/2012/05/when-no-redundancy-is-more-reliable/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smbitjournal.com/2012/05/when-no-redundancy-is-mo...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.smbitjournal.com/2012/11/one-big-raid-10-a-new-standard-in-server-storage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smbitjournal.com/2012/11/one-big-raid-10-a-new-st...</a>",1410493381

8306495,comment,8303422,8305153,2,0,possibilistic,,,"I have to differ.<p>All of life on earth operates using mostly the same biochemistry. While there are countless differences and exceptions (eg. different codons, different genome architecture, metabolic and gene product differences), they are vastly outweighed by the vast magnitude of commonality. This is mostly observable at the small scale (nucleic acid, protein, lipid chemistries) but also somewhat true at a larger scale (certain transport processes, etc).<p>Bacteria have an incredible amount of biochemistry in common with us. And so do all other living things. Bacteria will of course be radically different when we contrast ourselves to other eukaryotes, but we can still see our biochemistry in them.<p>We all evolved from the same lineage, so all of the &quot;core architectural&quot; decisions were made long ago--before prokaryotes even came into being. The earliest choices made in exploring the chemical-physical fitness landscape turned out to have the greatest impact; all of our biology is expressed in terms of the primitives that were first established. For example, the <i>universal adoption of the amino acid L-isomers</i>. It&#x27;s a seemingly arbitrary choice of little importance, but once that choice was made, earth biology forever had to live with it.<p>If there were different paths taken early on, metabolism would be different, polymerization would be different--cellular replication itself might also be different (one can only imagine). I imagine there would be cells. At higher levels, the choice of &quot;building blocks&quot; has an impact on bioinorganic chemistries (think heme groups). How you chelate depends on structure.<p>I assume that the heme group chemistry only evolved because of a highly oxygenated environment that life could exploit for energy production. Had our aqueous environment (and later atmosphere) been of a different composition, oxygen may not have played the same role.<p>Further tangent: certain elements are extremely important. Organic (carbon) chemistry is incredible due to the valence. Evolving on a world without oxygen might really suck, because oxygen chemistry is just so perfect for redox. And what of all the other important chemistries? Do they have a bioavailable source?<p>Anyhow, it&#x27;s suffice to say that any change in early evolutionary choices would have far-reaching impact on the essential reactions (energetics, thermo, kinetics, dynamics...) and might yield results that are altogether alien to us from an Earth biology standpoint. Once you have your building blocks, you can&#x27;t exactly backtrack.",1410493243
