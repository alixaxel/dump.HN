But when I got to that day, I felt only like having one beer or so, and same the following week.<p>Well, here&#x27;s an amazing thing, shocking and totally counterintuitive: I felt much better while doing this than I did for years before that. My mental acuity went up noticeably, and was much longer lasting - I would wake up at 7am and feel mentally sharp within 15 minutes, and stay mentally sharp all the way to 10pm or so.<p>I was forced due to holidays and social circumstances to resume drinking in August. Well, now that the social circumstances and holidays are out of the way, I&#x27;ve gone back to not drinking.

It helps you to recognize destructive thought patterns and how to deal with them.<p>- Garbage in, garbage out. What works for computers also works for your body. Yeah, you&#x27;re a geek but you can eat some vegs instead of the 500th pizza. Also working out (or other sports) are pretty great.<p>- Long term: Therapy which tries to work on the root cause and not just at symptoms.<p>Finally, here&#x27;s a rather extensive list with lectures, books, exercises, etc. which help dealing with depression [1]. Back when I was fed up with feeling crap I created a spreadsheet with the 8 activities and tracked those every day.<p>Note: Every person seem to react to differently.

8339919,comment,8339135,8339135,14,0,jorleif,,,"This is a very interesting idea and has some good potential for social change. So much energy, so misplaced. As a scandinavian my first thought is: Don&#x27;t Americans realize that there might a point where it is cheaper to provide (or more exactly, force) better education and social security on those at risk, than increasing the police force and incarceration rates?<p>There is something that is not quite right with this narrative that Gladwell spins though. His past examples are about the winners of their era. On the other hand, the contemporary examples are losers who end up killed and squeezed by the police. Presumably, in the earlier mafia era there were also plenty of losers, we just don&#x27;t hear about them.<p>The main thesis which I think is sound, though, is that innovation often (usually) involves a certain amount of breaking societal norms (which includes laws). It can take violent forms, such as the mafia, but also less violent law-breaking is often present. Think Napster, as a clear example but why not include Uber and AirBnB as well? Often innovation is not just about new technology, but rather re-negotiating social contracts. For this reason, when technological or social change introduces new economic opportunity, often it becomes populated by people who are willing to violate laws. I think as societies, we should try to figure out how to better utilize the violent and rebellious behvior of people, while limiting the detrimental effects. The same adrenaline addict might kill himself and a few pedestrian on a motorcycle when evading the police, but could instead be allowed to risk his life in some space exploration program or why not a technology startup.",1411126315

I&#x27;m hoping that the answers here will reassure people that you don&#x27;t need to drink to fit in.<p>I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and have never drank.  I have a lot of reasons for choosing to not drink, but probably the biggest is that I don&#x27;t like the idea of it affecting my behavior or decision-making (especially because I&#x27;ve seen how it affects OTHER people&#x27;s behavior and decision-making).<p>Nevertheless, I&#x27;ve tried to not let it affect my social life.  In college, I went to plenty of parties, and it was a bit weird being one of the only sober people in a house full of drunks, but I never felt ostracized because of it.  After college, I was one of the organizers of the Four-State Bar Crawl (four bars, four states, one crazy night) -- and naturally, I was one of the designated drivers.<p>I now work in an office where beer is stocked in the fridge, and most of my colleagues partake.  But again, it doesn&#x27;t really bother me because there&#x27;s soda stocked too.<p>Advice for people who were previously drinkers but are now trying to abstain:<p>* Don&#x27;t needlessly place yourself in tempting situations.<p>* If drinking was previously how you relaxed, or had fun, or networked, or socially lubricated yourself ... seek out alternative ways to fill the void.  For instance, if beer gave you confidence in social situations, consider attending a Toastmasters International session, which can help you with your contemporaneous speaking skills and boost your confidence.<p>* Befriend other non-drinkers.  We&#x27;ve had a lot of practice at finding ways to have fun without alcohol.<p>* Seek out support (and accountability) from other people or from groups like AA if it&#x27;s a real struggle.",1411125863

I am self-teaching mathematics, and even when trying Julia as a math tool, I find the basic unit of J, the array, as more amenable to my studies. It&#x27;s interesting how there is all the talk about &#x27;vectorization&#x27; and such in other languages, which J has been doing for decades. J is functional, and can have &#x27;for&#x27; loops, but loopless programming is encouraged and easy. When dealing with images or large data sets that are memory mapped, the operations are succinct and powerful and eye-opening.\nMy latest epiphany from moving away from using J as just a sophisticated calculator came after watching the 4 videos by Martin Saurer (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSJpJt3c11c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSJpJt3c11c</a>).

Fast. These guys have really distilled the libraries and made them work well with J (lapacke c interface to lapack). You get c speeds from an interpreter. I guess this is why q with kdb+ is used so much by the finance community despite how expensive it is.\nAnyway, I am currently staying with J, and I am writing my little tasks in J and julia to see how they fare against each other in speed and development efforts.

So I tried the following:<p>* I got myself some German non-alcoholic beer, to remove alcohol from the equation altogether. This measure is flawed, though, because apparently non-alcoholic beer sucks. In the interest of science, we&#x27;ll temporarily dismiss this as an excuse from drinkers and move on.<p>* I went to the Guiness factory in Dublin, and ordered myself a quarter of a pint. This should be a good baseline beer.<p>Result 1, non-alcoholic beer: it tastes awful. I&#x27;d describe it as sparkling tomato juice.

I don&#x27;t deny that the vision of receiving a fat check and being able to rent a beautiful office, buy the best equipment and hire a big team is tempting, but it&#x27;s something for something - the main goal of VCs is to grow like crazy, without a sentiment. A bootstrapped company will grow slowly, but steadily, and I don&#x27;t believe a VC backed competitor is a real threat in the long term. Sure, they can offer a similar product for free, but not forever - once the VC money is gone, they will need to get profitable. Fast. Without the VC money such company can dissapear the next month. Not to mention the interference of VCs how to run your company, which is of course expected - after all it&#x27;s their money that keeps your company alive.",1411124824
