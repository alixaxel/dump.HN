Rather than &#x27;surfing&#x27; the web it would be more like mapping it out and exploring it, with more than just your memory to return to.  I like the idea of a vertical tab bar on the side, and I think if the user interface were done right, one where the tabs of things which interest you never actually &#x27;close&#x27; (closing a tab would be equivalent to dismissing something as irrelevant or uninteresting) but the list of tabs just continues growing, scrolling off the top of the screen but recallable (and searchable) at a moments notice.  It would be major rethinking of how a browser works and what it does and it would possibly get confusing with things like web apps (shoehorning applications into a document presentation system bites us again).  I imagine lots of people would presume a proposal like this, keeping everything you ever browse or at least a very significant subset of it, as slightly insane... but that just makes it more alluring to me.",1409899929

I&#x27;ve sent hundreds of takedown notices for various clients, namely FUNimation Entertainment. Over 9,000 notices, in fact. And I&#x27;ve actually handled lawsuits involving specifics of the 17 USC § 512(c) provision.<p>No one can issue a DMCA takedown notice on behalf of Mojang without Mojang&#x27;s authorization. Period. A regular notice, yes--but not a DMCA takedown notice. This is because a DMCA notice triggers very specific and harsh liability if not acted upon. (Unless the alleged infringer files a counter-notification...but I digress)<p>As for copyright and the code this guy wrote, it&#x27;s considered a work of joint authorship and no joint author can prohibit the exploitation of a joint work by any of the other joint authors. They can each do what they want with it. All that the disgruntled dev can do is to sue for an accounting of royalties to be paid based on monies earned from the exploitation of the work. Have fun with that calculation. And notably, such a suit is NOT an infringement suit. So it stays in state court and doesn&#x27;t carry any of the crazy statutory damages or attorney&#x27;s fees penalties that an infringement suit would, assuming the work was registered with the U.S. Copyright Office, which it isn&#x27;t.<p>As for the GPL, it&#x27;s a nonexclusive license, revocable at will as to new users. Any dev who contributed to the work can license the work however he/she wants. Only the licensees (us users of bukkit) are bound by the GPL if and only if we downloaded bukkit pursuant to a GPL agreement.<p>All Mojang has to do is file a counter-notification and the files can all be reinstated without the webhost worrying about liability.",1409897784
