I&#x27;m advocating for knowing how much you&#x27;re actually drinking, and making sure you drink less than &quot;two glasses of wine a day&quot; - note that two glasses of wine maybe the equivalent of five or six drinks a day.<p>> The overall death rates were lowest among men and women reporting about one drink daily. Mortality from all causes increased with heavier drinking, particularly among adults under age 60 with lower risk of cardiovascular disease.<p>The article talks about research but misrepresents that research.<p>While the death rates for people drinking six drinks per days are lower than for people who abstain the rates are higher than for people who drink one drink a day.<p>And one drink is probably much smaller than people realise: 125 ml wine at 8% ABV is one drink.  175 ml at 14.5% (much more typical of what people actually drink) is 2.5 units; two glasses is 5 units.",1410695927

Especially at the doses suggested, lithium does not. What do you call psychoactive? Tomato sauce can make me happy, but it&#x27;s not sensible to call it psychoactive. On the contrary, it is widely reported that lead plumbing causes higher crime levels, lower IQs, and all sorts of bad things. Should we then resign and say we should not mess with the &quot;psychoactive properties&quot; of our drinking water? No, most things in our society are already artificial and engineered to achieve certain ends.

It leads us to over-praise the merely interesting in embarrassing ways.<p>Personally, I think we would do well to lower our sights a bit. No golfer specializes in holes-in-one; no baseball player only trains to hit home runs. Similarly, we might do well to focus less on the disruptive big ideas (which too often turn out to be merely over-hyped mediocre ideas), and more on building useful, elegant, cost-effective systems. This will let us do well with merely decent opportunities, and sets us up to <i>really</i> deliver when by chance or talent we come upon one of the great ones.",1410694947

It looks very promising, but I suspect it&#x27;s still too much of a deal for what I&#x27;d like to do. Plus, node.js compatible hosting looks expensive for my purposes and I simply can&#x27;t install it on my plain Dreamhost hosting account.\nJekyll looks great, but I still have to understand if it make sense to use it when not coupled with GitHub pages. \nKirby looks good, but I know almost nothing about it.\nI&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a lot more out there I don&#x27;t know about. \nI&#x27;d really like to hear your suggestions and personal experiences. \nIt will be great if you can link some demo sites for the platforms you&#x27;ll be mentioning.",1410692850

And I&#x27;ve tried hash/weed before (as well as another unidentified drug poured into my glass. my girlfriend bought the glass. Probably GHB. I actually liked it, I only regret not choosing it).<p>And I must say I&#x27;d like to try LSD.<p>Yet there&#x27;s a risk. I&#x27;ve suffered a cerebral stroke 10 years ago, and that condition could raise that risk. I&#x27;m aware of it. Anyway, <i>I</i> decide.<p>Prohibition? yes, it&#x27;s hugely inefficient. We grow as we learn to deal with our lives by ourself... Prohibition tries to prevent the society from coping with problems, without avoiding the problems themselves.

Essentially, if you as an API host server are sending back tons of redundant data, you are doing a disservice to your user by not passing references to this data in the first place. The results in your API should either include an entities section or links to retrieve more data. (Note the scale of repeated data I am talking about here are subtrees, not just key/value)<p>The programmer laziness is when an he just sends back JSON.stringify(someVeryLargeObject), instead of making sure only a minimal object is sent back.<p>So we can detect this laziness by running this tool and looking for 4x compression gains!",1410692417
