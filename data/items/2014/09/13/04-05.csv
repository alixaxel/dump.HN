8311664,comment,8308666,8309856,1,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"Warren Buffett wrote a letter to potential sellers of business that he (meaning Berkshire Hathaway) was interested in buying. It should be easy to find as I think it is reprinted in one of Berkshire&#x27;s annual reports.<p>The basic idea is this: it&#x27;s easy to make mistakes in business. As a startup or business in general you made many mistakes over the years that you&#x27;ve had to learn from and bounce back from in order to build you business into the success it currently is. You&#x27;ve earned this competence through your mistakes, and these mistakes cost you at the time you made them. Most businesses only get sold once (acquisition or IPO), so you want to go to the people who know what they&#x27;re doing when you go to sell your business. For all the shit investment bankers get, they are very good at their jobs.",1410584022

8311642,comment,8307834,8310766,3,0,georgemcbay,,,"I&#x27;m not so sure the future is as bright as you make it out for all those groups.  At the very least this change is going to bring with it a mountain of uncertainty.<p>As a driver, you probably lose your job.  Not with the 3-5 year out model, but the one that comes 10 years after that.   Even with the 3-5 year model, suddenly the competition for your job becomes extremely tight and starts to focus on things like people skills and entertaining, since the automated car will be doing most of the &quot;heavy lifting&quot; most of the time in a way that is automated into a commodity.<p>As Uber, you save a lot of money but you also lose a lot of moat, it becomes much easier/cheaper for other companies to suddenly field a fleet of cars.<p>As a car insurance company things look really iffy for you, again not so much in the 3-5 year timeframe but a bit further out when the human is completely unnecessary since at that point the insurance will be more about insuring the companies making the cars and car software and less about personal insurance, which means there is still significant money to be made, but probably far less than now (if the safety of automated cars turns out to be as great as it should) and by far fewer players.<p>As a car manufacturer, you&#x27;ll do well at the beginning but the eventual model of a networked driverless transportation system should require far fewer people to own fewer cars and still live as if they do own cars, which is a long term problem for you when you&#x27;ve built a business optimized to sell cars to broad market consumers on a 5-ish year cycle.<p>As a government you should, in an ideal world, be in pretty good shape for the reasons you outlined, but good luck dealing with the lobbyists from industries this may &quot;disrupt&quot;.<p>I do think driverless cars are quite a bit closer than most people think, for a lot of reasons, I just think they are going to upset a lot of applecarts on the way in, which isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing unless you&#x27;re an applecart vendor.",1410582543

Unfortunately, that seems to be the normal way these ridesharing companies operate: ignore the law knowing that when they&#x27;re called on it the media will spin it as &quot;Evil Government Bureaucrat Does Job&quot;<p>As others have pointed out, running the service inside of the regulation would probably require some changes on their part.  In particular, I bet they won&#x27;t be allowed to directly bill based on time or distance driven: if I&#x27;m on a bus that gets delayed in bad traffic or forced on a long detour I won&#x27;t be asked for more money, but in a cab I would be.  They should be able to still bill for distance-by-shortest-route though which should work well since it should be highly correlated, especially if they charge more during rush hour when travel is expected to be slower and thus costlier.",1410582254

8311623,comment,8308078,8311485,0,0,jrapdx3,,,"I&#x27;m not so sure diverse (divergent?) approaches to a problem are <i>always</i> better than one leader&#x27;s effort.<p>For one thing, stand-out genius or talent shows up <i>randomly</i> in populations, it&#x27;s not really predictable when or where it will occur.  But on rare occasion when a natural leader does emerge, suppressing diversity (of problem-solving approaches) is likely the better strategy.<p>The true maxima of human effort have generally followed this pattern, born of singularity and not diversity.  Once an innovation is widely enough known, it attracts a diverse range of followers who improve the idea and nurture its maturation.  Diversity is useful for the &quot;aftercare&quot; of innovation, but not its creation.<p>The other major point is that value of diversity (however defined) vs. uniformity depends on context.  In the context of one&#x27;s home, there may be many ways to arrange furniture in a room, and with few exceptions, one way is as valid as another.  By contrast, in a shared household over time diverse opinions are likely to converge to an arrangement using the space optimally.  Diversity probably leads to a better workflow solution vs. one person&#x27;s choices.<p>OTOH there is not a great diversity of &quot;valid&quot; ways to remove an inflamed appendix, that is, regardless of other considerations, a qualified surgeon is required and procedural diversity is constrained by the anatomical realities.  This situation demands uniformity not diversity.<p>Finally, &quot;diversity&quot; has an indeterminate number of definitions, and applicability of the term is entirely dependent on context.  On second thought, that would seem to drain it of specificity or meaning, on that ground, I should have a policy of using &quot;diversity&quot; carefully and sparingly.",1410581844

It&#x27;s often genetic and usually related to thyroid issues (which runs in my family, but so far I don&#x27;t seem to have, at least nothing out of normal so far).<p>My treatment was to avoid vitamin D and calcium as much as possible until my blood levels return to a normal range, then reintroduce them slowly. It&#x27;s harder than you think, since it seems like everything from orange juice to muffins these days is extra fortified to combat osteoporosis and to help with child development (Vitamin D and Calcium fortification in food stuffs is usually to prevent rickets but has the nice side benefit of supposedly helping with Osteoporosis later in life).<p>After a couple months the issues with the nerves in my face mostly went away and as that happened most of the fatigue disappeared. I&#x27;m unusually achy though, all over.<p>I can eat normal these days most of the time, but if I start feeling like I want to lie down and go to sleep all the time, or the muscles around my eyes feel twitchy, I usually just make sure to cut out dairy and stay out of the sun for a week or two and it goes away. Before I go to the beach or for some kind of extended outdoor activity I&#x27;ll cut my calcium intake as well.<p>I usually come back from a day in the sun with skull shattering headaches though (which is supposed to be a sign of Magnesium Deficiency, but I test fine for that) so I don&#x27;t enjoy many outdoor activities.<p>For me, Vitamin D kinda sucks.",1410581746

The differences seem to be the idea of incorporating a blockchain.  Also adding a layer of analytics to help the network establish the probability that the actor is identified within the network with only a single identity.<p>Also my original concept is less about establishing the connections with only people you trust.  One idea I had was that if you&#x27;re only confirmed by people you trust, it may not be as easy for the network to detect fraud (ie. multiple identities) as compared to a network that requires you to confirm your identity across some random subset of the entire network.  If you&#x27;re forced to confirm your identity across the entire network (or some random subset) my intuition tells me it would be less likely that someone could circumvent the rule that you&#x27;re only allowed to have one identity on the network.<p>Thanks for the info.",1410581141
