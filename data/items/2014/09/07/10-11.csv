Increasingly, other applications are also starting to use this pattern.  It is easier to add a few safeguards into the library than it is to fix every past, present and future application that uses it.<p>It&#x27;s a start.  Adding the safeguard doesn&#x27;t mean effort won&#x27;t be put into fixing the actual bugs.  But you just don&#x27;t fix all the world&#x27;s bugs overnight.  That&#x27;s why things like virtual memory, permissions, chroots, ASLR, NX, SSP and such exist.<p>How many systems enable core dumps by default?  I don&#x27;t actually know, but I think quite a few do.  Every application you use to get stuff done is a production application.  Every application that handles sensitive information handles sensitive information whether it is in production or not.

Dart2JS is an implementation of the Dart specification that transpiles to JS and is supported by every modern browser. Dart also has great support for Source Maps letting you debug (JS Transpiled) Dart code in other browsers via source maps.<p>The Dart team expect Dart2JS will be the primary way of running Dart which is why they&#x27;ve designed the language so that it transpiles well to JavaScript as a primary objective - i.e. they&#x27;ve often rejected language features which can&#x27;t be implemented efficiently in JS (e.g. non-local returns).<p>It&#x27;s also not clear if Opera (by virtue of Blink) will adopt Dart once it lands into Chromium/Blink.<p>> Google can push Dart the same way MS did with ActiveX<p>ActiveX is a proprietary binary blob that has nothing in common with Dart. Dart is entirely Open Source, runs on all modern browsers and integrates cleanly with the DOM (i.e. like JS).<p>> C# is an ECMA standard too; how well did Mono fare in the early days and even now after more than ten years?<p>Only the language is a standard which Mono&#x27;s compiler and runtime has excellent support for. The biggest problem Mono faces is that they&#x27;ve had to re-implement the massive .NET Framework class libraries themselves.

Forth plays its strength when controlling hardware. Your code is immediate executed, and you see the results, e.g. a robot arm moving instantly. Times of Forth coders running circles around teams using traditional programming languages are nearly over.<p>Smalltalk on the other hand still has to find its killer application. Smalltalk was 35 years to early, and since then every few month a new language is hyped, each one one step closer to Smalltalk. Computing history turns in cycles and we soon will have a situation comparable to VM/370, where every application is running its own operating system.

Considering that Dart is open source, standardized by the same international body as JavaScript (ECMA), and compiles to JavaScript I think the argument against it would be weightier if it was made on technical merits.<p>But I agree that it would be dangerous for one company to control the web - but like you said it&#x27;s a pipe dream that Dart will gain wider adoption - so why worry yourself by writing all that about it? <i>You can&#x27;t say it will never gain wider adoption and then also be worried about it gaining wider adoption at the same time.</i> So either it has merit and will gain adoption and we should be worried about it, or it doesn&#x27;t have merit and there&#x27;s nothing to worry about.",1410084423

The problem is aesthetic[1]. Some letterforms are inherently unbalanced and create tension, notably the wild angles in the m, the serif in the s, and the tipping-over T. The wobbles in the I, n, and h distract as well. Beyond that, there are the subtler issues of different inclination on the verticals (j, t, l, h) and bad kerning for various character pairs.<p>If Comic Sans were truly convincing as handwritten font, it would probably be better; on the plus side it is sufficiently far from that that it avoids falling in the very bottom of a handwriting uncanny valley.<p>Now aesthetics doesn&#x27;t necessarily impede legibility per se, but beauty and visual harmony are generally enjoyable, and  use of Comic Sans eschews it. Compare it to the much better Comic Neue[2].<p>[1] example: <a href=""http://kinkeaddesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Comic-Sans-Probs.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kinkeaddesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Comic-S...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://comicneue.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://comicneue.com/</a>",1410084334

Back then Rich Hickey described JVM as &quot;the default platform of choice&quot; for &quot;serious development&quot; (read - corporations). OK, I am paraphrasing a bit, but he explicitly praised JVM.)",1410084220

But I suspect that Swift may have dependencies on new or recent Foundation features which could be missing from the open-source versions (for understandable reasons, they lag behind Apple by several years).",1410084118
