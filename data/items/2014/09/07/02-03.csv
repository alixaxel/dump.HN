Key strokes are good, connection has been very reliable, no latency.

8280207,comment,8276145,8279902,5,0,tel,,,"Corecursion is when you define the meaning of a type by a coalgebra like<p><pre><code>    x -> F x\n</code></pre>\nfor some pattern functor F. So, for instance, defining an infinite stream like<p><pre><code>    newtype Stream = Stream { runStream :: (X, Stream) }\n</code></pre>\nis corecursion. The interesting part is that whatever defines the stream is forced to fix the Stream type immediately. Open (co)recursion in OO langauges occurs when the recursive type is left undefined (i.e., self is passed in). This allows you to change the type of the object at every step if desired.<p>The similar game in a recursive function might be defining face like so<p><pre><code>    fact :: (Int -> Int) -> (Int -> Int)\n    fact recur n = n * recur (n-1)\n</code></pre>\nWe &quot;tie the knot&quot; by passing fact to itself<p><pre><code>    fix f = f (fix f)\n\n    fix fact :: Int -> Int\n</code></pre>\nwhich would allow us to add extra cases as needed<p><pre><code>    let term recur n = if n == 0 then 1 else recur n\n\n    > fix fact 3\n    -- infinite loop\n    > fix (term . fact) 3\n    6\n</code></pre>\nSo this is a kind of &quot;mixing&quot; of recursive functions. Open corecursion lets you do OO-like &quot;mixing&quot; of corecursive functions.",1410058671

And by outlaw I don&#x27;t mean entirely, but instead a language which requires the programmer explicitly opt into these richer domains as they are needed.<p>My understanding is that while these principles are understood as valuable, OO is generally constructed as too permissive to enforce them.<p>In a similar story, unbounded recursion is generally &quot;bad&quot; in almost every part of a program---nobody likes mysteriously hanging programs---but only total languages have a formalism which allows you to profitably outlaw it.<p>So I&#x27;m convinced there are the beginnings of the theory of objects lurking around out there even if they rarely see the light of day (really) in practice. But I also recognize that modern functional semantics grew over the last 80 years. I don&#x27;t think (maybe I&#x27;m wrong) that the whole package of OO has had so long to mature.",1410058183

For example, in Real World OCaml [ <a href=""https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/objects.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/objects.html</a> ]), and I quote from Chapter 11:<p>> <i>You might wonder when to use objects in OCaml, which has a multitude of alternative mechanisms to express the similar concepts. First-class modules are more expressive (a module can include types, while classes and objects cannot). Modules, functors, and data types also offer a wide range of ways to express program structure. In fact, many seasoned OCaml programmers rarely use classes and objects, if at all.</i><p>To be fair, the chapter goes on to explain why you&#x27;d want objects. It also states they are very different from objects as understood by other OO languages.
