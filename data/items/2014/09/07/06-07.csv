However the subspace clustering method used (GPCA) has poor performance compared to newer methods like Sparse/Low-Rank Subspace Clustering.

I truly believe that quite a few people would try to act if they knew the war was coming to an end, their action would be seen as heroic, and therefore they either live as heroes or at least be remembered as such. Conversely, it&#x27;s not tempting to act if you&#x27;re going to be vilified when the Nazis win and rule the world.<p>2. Wasn&#x27;t it clear by 1944 (or whenever) that the Nazis would lose? In a way yes, but if you want to argue that, think about Syria. A year ago it was clear that Assad was finished, he would certainly lose his power and quite possibly his life. Today he&#x27;s not only in power (over a smaller Syria), but some in the West are actually wondering if we shouldn&#x27;t include him in a coalition against IS. Now that he gave up his chemical weapons, we&#x27;re clearly fine with whatever he&#x27;s doing.",1410073143

Anything which is successful and starts to spread in your ecosystem, you can identify through consumption information, so you can leverage the ecosystem to spot successful development and then you commoditize these new components.&quot;",1410071535

Now we have acceptable speed for surfing but it quite often doesn&#x27;t look like instant.<p>Going from ADSL to ethernet reduces latency by order of magnitude for the connection to local internet. That is the big jump. And that latency reduction helps gamers too. This is the big advantage of going for Fiber instead of lets try how we can put as much bandwidth as possible through this copper never designer for it.<p>As for bandwidth, lets consider the other side of story where you get those bits from, they too have limited bandwidth and have to support maybe thousands of simultaneous users with it.<p>And once they found the killer app for the 1Gbit internet they are not going to recognize that. As bandwidth is only visible when there seems to be too little of it, not when there is enough of it, and those who have too little of it often just need to wait some additional seconds and never realize that it could be almost instant, and totally miss the point of having additional bandwidth. \nOnly way to recognize the killer app for this is use with Gbit fiber and then go with friends house and use it with their ADSL and realize you cannot stand how slow/limited it is.<p>Once you start replacing last mile with Fiber there is no point trying to save few bucks in an expensive project and have order of magnitude less bandwidth than what they reasonably can offer.",1410071509
