I understand that at the moment, the VC funded route is undoubtedly the only logical path. However, that doesn&#x27;t change the fact that it is extremely sub-optimal in the long run. In a different era, you would have your own lab after a quick run through academia and ample funding to pursue your research. You would not be restricted to working on an ITER style mega project.<p>I would be willing to accept the end of those times if the alternative (VC funded startups) was superior. Alas, when it comes to large problems, I fear it may be a massive step back.<p>The oncoming wave of labor automation should spark a new debate about how we want to reorganize our societies to adapt to such drastic changes. I&#x27;m hoping that at this point, we can begin to emphasize the importance of research as a fundamental human endeavor.",1411091961

Thank goodness for <i>social promotion</i>!  But in math, from grade 9 through high school, college, graduate school, work, to the present, I totally effortlessly blow away nearly every female I&#x27;ve come across.

For me it feels much more logical to work with pure functions with consistent output based on input. At work I&#x27;m told to use more OO but it feels really enforced and not intuitive at all. The only time it makes sense for me is in game development where you have many entities of the same type that all have their own states.<p>I feel I should learn OO properly and maybe try Java or something where you have to code OO. On the other hand I also feel I should go with my gut feeling, forget about OO and just learn FP instead. It feels wrong though to &quot;skip&quot; OOP seeing most serious programmers seem to have a background in it. What do you think?",1411091248

So once you start at the company you already have a viable amount of knowledge in programming, databases, networking, etc and supposed to be able to work on your own.<p>You don&#x27;t get constant mentoring at the company, but can ask one of the developers or fellow apprentices when you&#x27;re stuck with one of the tasks you get assigned. Or for example, any time a developer had a small task that he felt, I couldn&#x27;t do by myself, or it was too time critical he just asked me to sit beside him and watch, listen and take notes while he did the work. \nHow it works is different in any company but the outcome should be the same: real world experience on real projects with real clients and their time/budget constraints.<p>That means, once your finished and a professional yourself, it \nisn&#x27;t a question of interest but a completely normal thing to help out the apprentices.

So many ways:<p>- small angel investors cant afford to spend a large amount on lawyers, so simple legal terms are enablers<p>- rolling closes are massive enablers. They mean you don&#x27;t need a lead. Which means there isn&#x27;t anyone with leverage. Which means if anyone thinks the price is too high they can drop out without affecting the price from the other investors. In fact, since you&#x27;ll have cash in the bank from half your investors, you can raise with the financial pressure off, and demand a higher price from other investors.<p>- cheap legal fees allow smaller rounds (even a cheap priced round is 15-25k; our bill came to 42k).

Also the girls have much better understanding of emotions and, thus, better understand the emotional content of fictional readings.  Also, as in D. Tannen, the girls are much more active in talking with their friends, i.e., their girlfriends, with gossip, and, thus, get still better at understanding people and social situations, including what is in the fictional readings, the classroom <i>social</i> dynamics, etc.<p>The OP also claimed that the girls are better at &quot;math&quot;, but here I start to question.  Sure, for math in K-8 or so, the girls are much better because they have much better clerical accuracy and much better handwriting (better at getting the columns of digits lined up important for accuracy).  And, again the girls are better at and more interested in pleasing the teachers.<p>And, with some teaching and grading styles, the girls might be able to seem better at math through grade 12 or so.  It can continue to be a really big advantage to be really good at sensing how to please the teachers, and girls are better at that.<p>But my experience in math (and I was a math major in college and my Ph.D. is in applied math), really, for much of anything like real math, the girls are a big step down.  Somehow they don&#x27;t <i>get it</i>; here maybe the main problem is lack of interest due to cultural stereotypes that girls are not supposed to concentrate on STEM subjects.<p>Last I heard, on the math SATs, the boys still do much better than the girls and, yes, on the verbal SATs the girls do better than the boys.<p>Then for the girls/women along come marriage and babies, and then on average their ability to compete with boys/men in most of more important work fades.",1411089594

You may need to massage the medium between two modules, but guess what, we have other modules like cut and sed and awk, that are not only able to transform the medium so that modules can be attached to one another, but themselves only had to be written once.<p>I think the Unix pipe pattern of architecture works very well in the large, and you see things very close to it elsewhere. C#&#x27;s Linq is fundamentally based on transforming iterator streams - little different, architecturally, than Unix pipes. The Rack middleware stack in Rails has a similar structure - every module has a single method, and recurses into the next step in the pipeline, and gets a chance to modify input on the way in and output on the way out. Both get their power by using fundamentally the same &quot;type&quot; on all the boundaries between modules, rather than module-specific types.
