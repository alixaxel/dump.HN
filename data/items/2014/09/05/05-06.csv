8272511,comment,8271959,8271959,5,0,xnull2guest,,,"The problem with this is that the grove will not be able to grow enough to sustain (or come close to sustaining) even a single person. By the very, very most optimistic calculations (best recorded growth in tropical greenhouses) you need at a minimum 300 sq ft of space. But more realistically a 1000 sq ft or more are required to sustain a person.<p>Then there&#x27;s actually a ton of labor that goes into growing, picking and correcting the plants. Just ask someone who has worked in a garden, tried aquaponics or grown something hydroponically (weed or otherwise). Automation can still only do so much, especially when it isn&#x27;t at scale.<p>This relegates their grove to growing single types of plants very well. Growing fruits requires more light than vegetables, but either way you&#x27;re looking at at least 40 watts per sq ft of space, usually much more (especially since the light needs to penetrate down through the leaves). For even a small setup of 8 sq ft you&#x27;re looking at something that pulls 4 kwh of electricity a day at minimum (around a half a dollar). Taking between 3 and 6 months to grow some fruits you&#x27;re look at a minimum of $75 a yield but probably closer to $400-$500 or even more after you calculate the costs of HVAC (big), water pumping and heating/cooling costs and chemicals (which are on the order of a dollar-per-day expensive). And then a lot of the equipment needs to be replaced and is very expensive, especially if you are running lights. Most of those have a shelf life of around a half year, unless you do LEDs which are extremely expensive investments. Of course this needs to be compared to the yield but generally economies of scale, even organic ones, can produce goods much cheaper. And hydro isn&#x27;t organic...<p>The reason hydroponics is associated with weed is because you need to grow something that costs more than your inputs.",1409896313

Each log entry is either committed or not; an entry can only be committed if it has been replicated to a majority of nodes. Any node that lacks a committed entry cannot be elected master because of the election rules: a node will not vote for another node less complete than itself. Since a committed entry has been replicated to a majority, a node lacking that entry cannot receive a majority of the votes. (Thus the committed log entries will always be the same on all nodes (though some may be behind, and may only have a subset), which is the purpose of the protocol.)<p>> Considering it basically relies on random chance (I.E. who receives the message first) to elect a master, has basically no real way of resolving a conflict in election<p>This is mostly true.

Without proper motivation from students the institutions can’t improve student performance. The institutions are brainstorming new methods to engage students with high motivation.Gone are the days when A for apple, B for ball, in the era of internet it’s A for android, B for Bluetooth. Now everything is being centralized around computer technology. So institutions are forced to use latest methodology to motivate students. Gamification is one of the latest methodologies being used to motivate students.<p>Gamification is nothing but using gaming mechanism in the process of learning. There are various gaming mechanisms that can be incorporated with the classroom. The main Gamification mechanisms used are progress mechanics, social interactions, collaborative approach to problem solving etc.<p>The gamified approach of learning helps the students in many ways. Not only it gets students motivated but also enhances their analytical thinking, develops their creativity and helps achieve their goal. It helps them think in a whole new way and it makes learning a enjoyable process.<p>gamification_vjgusSocial learning platforms such as COURSEEPLUS offer’s various Gamification mechanisms from sign up to sign out which makes learning a fun thing to do. For every step the student finishes, points are rewarded and later, on the successful completion of the course, badges and certificates are provided. All these, motivate students to achieve more and makes them collaborate with others.In the era of internet, everything revolves around social media. It is high time institutions use new methods of teaching to improve student performance. Social learning platforms, cloud campus, Gamification etc help institutions motivate students at the same time make learning an enjoyable thing to do.",1409895685

Per Prop 218 (See: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_218_(1996)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Proposition_218_(19...</a>), every garbage rate payer in San Francisco had a chance to shoot down the rate hike on this $228m contract. The process to do so was not simple. You had to write a letter to the Refuse Collection Rate Hearing Officer and send it via USPS. Fax, email, text, or Twitter would not be accepted in this modern electronic age. How many people do you think wrote a letter to reach the 50% +1 to overturn the hike? Probably a handful.<p>What SF rate payers ended up with is a 21.51% rate increase, ten times CPI, and formally free compost and recycle bins had to be paid for per bin and bin size. Ratepayers are no fools, yet Recology is going to get away with this program that claims to bring the City of San Francisco to “zero waste”, while the city of San Jose, with far more land mass and greater population, has done more for far less than the $228m that Recology charges SF ratepayers.<p>I don&#x27;t think Recology will ever reach zero-waste until they&#x27;ve been ejected and a competitive market is put into place. This is unfortunate since SF really has made strong strides toward &quot;zero-waste&quot;, but the open racketeering and corruption in the garbage pickup system makes the goal slide further away each day.<p>Edit: References and corrections<p>San Jose Diversion rate: 2013 71%, 60% excluding construction waste <a href=""http://sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/23309"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sanjoseca.gov/DocumentCenter/View/23309</a><p>SF Diversion rate: 2013 80%, but 60% excluding construction waste <a href=""http://discardstudies.com/2013/12/06/san-franciscos-famous-80-waste-diversion-rate-anatomy-of-an-exemplar/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://discardstudies.com/2013/12/06/san-franciscos-famous-8...</a>",1409894952
