The string literal is a &str with a infinite lifetime, and so can of course be safely restricted to have the same lifetime as the other branch (done implicitly).<p>However, it&#x27;s easily possible to have the &str come from temporaries of different types in the two branches. This would restrict the static destruction case to only working through an `if` when the &quot;parent&quot; values have exactly the same types; which doesnt seem nearly as valuable and possibly not worth the effort.",1411250378

Honest question: English is my second language and I&#x27;m not very good with it.<p>> You can.<p>You&#x27;re wrong. Here, take a look:<p><pre><code>    iex(4)> f = fn() -> a = 0; (fn()->a=9 end).(); a end\n    #Function<20.80484245/0 in :erl_eval.expr/5>\n    iex(5)> f.()\n    0\n</code></pre>\nf.() should evaluate to 9 if what you said was true. Either there&#x27;s a special syntax for doing this in Elixir (like nonlocal in Python 3) or it&#x27;s absent, and then the scoping rules are the same in Elixir and Erlang, with a bit of syntactic sugar for SSA transformation, which you need to do by hand in Erlang.<p>Again, I&#x27;m not Elixir programmer, so this is a honest question: is there some special syntax which would make the example above produce 9? I doubt it <i>very</i> much because it wouldn&#x27;t fit very well with BEAM, but everything is possible and I&#x27;d be glad to learn about another nice feature of Elixir.",1411249687

If a programmer starts writing a code that declares some variables and opens a for loop, the smart editor starts searching the open source projects and lists the code chunks with beginnings most resembling what you&#x27;ve typed so far, and then you can pick one of those if you like, or keep writing.

It is proposing to allow ISPs to charge fees for better quality of service, not to degrade the service that&#x27;s already provided. In fact the proposals quite specifically forbid this.<p>-- &quot;if ... fails&quot;<p>The problem with this is, net neutrality is not in effect now. And has not been at all in history, except for a brief period before the courts shot it down (because the FCC was overstepping its authority). And, nothing like the &quot;fast/slow lanes&quot; version of the predicted net-neutrality-copalypse has happened.<p>So to say &quot;what if net neutrality fails&quot; has it exactly backwards. We already know what the no-net-neutrality world looks like, we are in it now. The real question is, what if it succeeds? What will happen then?",1411247168

Around 6 or 7 I notice a slowdown and then by 10 everything is fine again. Unless you have a business plan or a leased line I highly doubt you have an SLA, probably just good customer service and one of those &quot;guarantees&quot;.<p>I think consumers that want that are being stupid, I&#x27;d much rather be able to work at higher speeds at night than have a network wide SLA that says we all get 5 M/s. I&#x27;d also much rather pay 20-30/mo for my internet than 60. Think about the ridiculous expense if they needed to engineer highways just to avoid the 2 hours of traffic every day. Would you really be rallying for a 12 lane highway that sits essentially empty most of the day? You&#x27;re basically paying for a massive amount of stuff that goes unused 90+% of the time.",1411247164

The recent EBay hack for example lost the company huge amounts of money (remember seeing but haven&#x27;t had luck finding the numbers online).<p>But you&#x27;re only thinking about customer retailers.<p>Many companies need to keep their intellectual property, source code, designs and trade secrets safe from hackers and competitors. Intel is a great example of a company that dominates an industry purely due to IP. Chinese companies (and government) sponsored hackers would love to utilize 12 nm transistor technology to outcompete Intel. I can&#x27;t help but to wonder what Intel microcode update keys would sell for.<p>Brazilian PETROBRAS lost billions of dollars when they got hacked by the NSA and as a result lost offshore oil drill location auctions.<p>There&#x27;s also &#x27;outsider trading&#x27;. Intimate knowledge of what financial decisions companies and states are going to make is big money (<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/l834xou"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/l834xou</a>).<p>Finally, there&#x27;s stealing money directly from corporate accounts (Axis Bank). A recent example are the thefts of large numbers of bitcoins from bitcoin trading companies.
