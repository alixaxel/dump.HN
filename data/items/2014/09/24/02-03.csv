Assuming that Netflix was only a single channel, anyhow.<p>But hey, let&#x27;s suppose that Netflix has not a single channel but say, 1000 channels.  That&#x27;s way, way way more than cable or satellite or anything like that.  Okay, but Netflix has nearly 7000 movies and a bunch of TV shows, so it&#x27;s not a 1000 channel broadcaster.<p>Let&#x27;s say that Netflix has one channel for every movie and every show in their collection.  That&#x27;s something like 10000 or more channels (which is way way way more than any other broadcaster in the history of the world has ever offered) and it STILL wouldn&#x27;t work!<p>Why not?  Because you can start watching a Netflix title WHENEVER you want.  But let&#x27;s be reasonable, let&#x27;s say that they&#x27;ll run as many channels as they need so that you never have to wait more than a minute to start streaming.  Since most of their titles are movies and a movie is on average around 90 minutes long, that&#x27;s 10k*90 = 900k channels.<p>There you have it folks!

8359656,comment,8356489,8356489,1,0,stephenr,,,"For background: I grew up (until about 28) in Australia, then moved to Thailand (a couple of years ago).<p>1. For pleasure, and because most western food I&#x27;ve found in Thailand is not great. Regardless of the meal it would almost always be cheaper to eat out here.<p>2. Not so much a meal plan - usually we just look and see what is available/looks good (i.e. imported or less common items are not always available or fresh) at the market/supermarket and then make decisions based based on that.<p>3. Various pasta sauces are quite common as they&#x27;re quick and easy (especially if my wife wants Thai food that night and I don&#x27;t), but anything from roasts to curries (both thai and indian), to things like risotto, pizza, burgers, and various &#x27;meat & veg&#x27; using stuff like salmon, steak, etc.<p>4. Not specifically, I just try to watch what goes into the pan/pot - trim excessive fat/skin from meat, use olive oil when possible, reduce salt/sugar/cream/butter etc when possible.<p>5. Experiment when you can. For me a recipe is almost never an actual recipe but more like a napkin-sketch outline of the basic ingredients and process. I lived alone for several years which really gave me good opportunities to try things and get a feel for what works and what doesn&#x27;t. When you are the only person who will end up hungry (if it fails) its so much easier to be brave and try something new - it becomes inspiration to try again until you find something that works. I find I&#x27;m much less likely to experiment to the same extent if I&#x27;m cooking for my wife. I&#x27;ll usually get her to try stuff when I do, but its not common I will try something I&#x27;ve never done before if she is expecting to eat what I&#x27;m cooking for dinner.",1411526973

Then there is the issue of runway. With enough time, you can start with an MVP and iterate in private beta until users love it, but in many cases a founder is not going to have that kind of runway. They have just enough resources to put something together, and they&#x27;re going to have to go out to the market with that and iterate on the fly. Unfortunately, once you do get out there and need to take on all of the other responsibilities, then that&#x27;s time taken away from building a great product.",1411526397

This limit order happens to trigger some threshold for the order flow trading algorithm that causes it to back off of it&#x27;s own orders (lets say it cancels some orders on the back of the other side of the book).  This in turn causes a price shift that moves away from the customers limit order making it fill later.<p>Clearly we are in the realm of pure speculation and probably not something that is important to the customers of robinhood.  I was just pointing out that conceptually, by selling their order flow, robinhood could impact fill rates.<p>My guess is that this is more than offset by the lack of fees.",1411526213

8359548,comment,8359107,8359286,5,0,TimPC,,,"So here is a simple idea. If you&#x27;re going to work 80h/week anyway and you&#x27;re a talented coder:  source one contract job billing hourly in London and another in SF. Working out of EST you work 5AM-9PM on a 10-6 in both places -- Billing $80/hr with a good corporate setup and working 4000 hours/year you can get 320,000/year, if you have EU citizenship (potentially from one of the return countries) and US citizenship you can probably setup a decent double irish and keep about 280,000+ of that in offshore money.  If you want the money in the US and are clever about it you can keep over 250,000 of that money.  I suggest London and SF because the 8h timezone difference and high cost of living in both cities.  But to give you an idea this is basically $2.5M after-tax locked in the time it takes to make a 10 year exit. That&#x27;s 1/4 of the first example and way more than 25% of start-ups fail.  Admittedly $2.5M isn&#x27;t the kind of resources that lets you go after solving the biggest problems in the world, but it&#x27;s pretty solid by developer standards. 1.8X is a good return for a venture capital fund and they have more favourable stock than employees or founders, so you have to think the average start-up return for founders, even enormously talented ones is far worse than that.<p>Edit corrected typo in time worked.",1411524742
