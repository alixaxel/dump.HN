Our internal investigation into our servers and logs have not yet found the RIG exploit kit or evidence that there was in fact a compromise.<p>RiskIQ was able to make contact with the jQuery Infrastructure team on September 18th, at which point with members of the RiskIQ team tried to find evidence of compromise. So far the investigation has been unable to reproduce or confirm that our servers were compromised. We have not been notified by any other security firm or users of jquery.com confirming a compromise. Normally, when we have issues with jQuery infrastructure, we hear reports within minutes on Twitter, via IRC, etc.<p>At no time have the hosted jQuery libraries been compromised.<p>Currently the only potential system compromised is the web software or server that runs jquery.com. We have asked RiskIQ to help us look through our server logs and systems to help identify when and how a compromise happened. Please check this blog post for updates on the situation.<p>Even though we don’t have immediate evidence of compromise, we have taken the proper precautions to ensure our servers are secure and clean. If you happened to visit any of the our sites on September 18th and are afraid of your system being compromised you can follow the advice RiskIQ recommends:<p>Immediately re-image system\nReset passwords for user accounts that have been used on the system\nSee if any suspicious activity has originated from the offending system",1411523018

8359489,comment,8359107,8359386,3,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"Based on the holdings disclosed at the time of Facebook&#x27;s IPO, and even accounting for the rise in the company&#x27;s stock, I doubt very much that employee #100 at Facebook is sitting on $200 million in gains from his or her options or RSUs. In the case of Dropbox, looking at what the Box founders own according to Box&#x27;s S-1[1] probably provides a more realistic comp.<p>One thing worth noting is that Dustin&#x27;s slide apparently fails to take into account the cost of exercising options. You can absolutely make a lot of money at a startup, and you don&#x27;t even need to be one of the earliest employees to do so, but today&#x27;s valuation trend works against employees. Startups are raising money at significant valuations earlier and earlier, so even early employees aren&#x27;t receiving cheap equity.<p>As an example of this, consider that Facebook had sold shares at a $15 billion valuation just three years after the company was founded. Google went public at a valuation under $27 billion (edit: corrected). If you had your choice, you&#x27;d almost certainly have received a better equity package as an early rank-and-file employee of Google versus Facebook.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fortune.com/2014/03/25/aaron-levie-owns-more-of-box-than-you-think/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fortune.com/2014/03/25/aaron-levie-owns-more-of-box-t...</a>",1411522995

Ed McCreight was in the\naudience and asked, &#x27;Is a similar result true for 2-3 trees?&#x27; The counterexample shown in Fig. 3\nwas described. He then asked, &#x27;How about 10-50 trees?&#x27;&quot;<p>(Ed McCreight co-invented the B-tree)<p>([4] is Blum, N., Mehlhorn, K.: On the average number of rebalancing steps in weight-balanced trees.\nTheor. Comput. Sci. 11, 303-320 (1980))<p>However, you don&#x27;t actually have to understand all of this to get the\ngist of why 2-3 trees don&#x27;t have constant-amortized-time\nmodifications. You can see that from a simple little experiment on\nbinary numbers.<p>Imagine that you had to implement binary arithmetic on your own. The\nfirst thing you implement is a binary counter with only increment. It\nstarts at 0, you can add 1 as many times as you like. That&#x27;s it.<p>Note that a counter with n bits may require n bit flips to\nincrement 11111...1. However, by assigning a binary number a potential of the\nnumber of 1 bits, you can see that incrementing takes O(1) amortized\nbit flips using the physicist&#x27;s method.<p>This doesn&#x27;t work when you can also subtract one from your counter,\nsince subtracting one can turn a lot of 0s into 1s. Adding one again\nturns them back, and you&#x27;re back where you started, having spent no\npotential yet requiring a bunch of bit flips in each operation.<p>However, if you allow each digit to be 0, 1, or 2, you can assign a\npositive potential to the 0 and 2 digits and zero potential to the 1\nbits to show that both increment and decrement use O(1) amortized bit\nflips.<p>The same thing happens with 2-3 trees vs. 2-3-4 trees. I believe 2-3 trees have amortized O(1) insert if deletion is not permitted, but 2-3-4 trees permit both.<p>Number systems have some deep connections to data structure design like this. One place you can read more is in Okasaki&#x27;s book, &quot;Purely Functional Data Structures&quot;, through plenty of free resources exist on the topic as well - Amr Elmasry tends to publish about it a lot. Once you get it, you start to see the pattern in many other places.",1411522046

Might include minor errors or misinterpretation on my side<p>4 critical parts: Idea, Team, Product, Execution<p>1. Idea<p>-> Good startups take about 10 years<p>-> Startup should feel like an important mission<p>-> Hardest part coming up with great ideas: best look terriblea t the beginning (e.g. search engine, social networks limited to college students without money, a way to stay at stranger&#x27;s couches)<p>-> &quot;Today only a small subset of users want to use my product, but I&#x27;m going to get all of them&quot;<p>-> You need to believe and willing to ignore naysayers<p>-> Most people will think your idea is bad: be happy. they won&#x27;t compete. it&#x27;s not dangerous to tell people your idea.<p>-> it&#x27;s okay if it doesn&#x27;t sound big at first. first version should take over a small specific market and expand from there. unpopular but right<p>-> take the time to think about how the market will evolve. market size in ~10 years. think about growth rate of the market instead of its current size. small, but rapidly growing market! people are desperate for a solution<p>-> you cannot create a market that does not exist<p>-> there are many great ideas, pick and find one you really care about.. &quot;SW is eating the world&quot;<p>-> &quot;Why Now?&quot; - dixit Sequoia - have a great answer to this question<p>-> Build something that you yourself need. You&#x27;ll understand it a lot better.<p>-> Get close to your customers. Work in their office or talk to them multiple times a day<p>-> If it takes more than a sentence to you know what you&#x27;re doing, it likely is too complicated<p>-> &quot;Do more when you&#x27;re a student.&quot; Think about new ideas and meet potential co-founders<p>-> Think about the market first and you&#x27;ll have a big leg up<p>2. Product<p>-> Great Idea > Great Product > Great Company<p>-> Until you build a great product, almost nothing else matters<p>-> Sit in front of the computer working on product, or talk to your customers<p>-> Biz Dev, Raising Money, Raising Press, Hiring are significantly easier when you have a great product<p>-> Step 1: build something that users love<p>-> YC is all about: Exercise, Eat, Sleep, Work on Product and Talk to Customers<p>-> &quot;It&#x27;s better to build something that a small number of users love, than a large number of users like&quot;<p>-> Get growth by word of mouth. This works for consumer as well as enterprise products. You&#x27;ll see organic growth. If you don&#x27;t have some early organic growth, then your product isn&#x27;t good enough. It&#x27;s the secret sauce to growth hacking.<p>-> Breakout companies always have a product that&#x27;s so good that grows on word of mouth<p>-> Great products win. Make something users love.<p>-> Keep it simple. Look at first versions of Google, Facebook, iPhone<p>-> Founders care about small details. They&#x27;re fanatical<p>-> One thing that correlates with success is hooking up PagerDuty to their ticketing system. Response time within an \nhour.<p>-> Go recruit your first users by hand to get feedback every day.<p>-> When everyone tought Pinterest was a joke, Ben Silbermann walked around coffee shops in Palo Alto to convince people to use Pinterest. He set Pinterest to the home page in the Palo Alto public library so people would discover the website. Do things that don&#x27;t scale. Read Paul Graham&#x27;s essay.<p>-> Create a tight feedback loop. What do users like? What do they pay for? What would make them recommend it?<p>-> Try to keep your feedback loop going for all of your companies&#x27; life<p>-> Do sales and customer support yourself in the early days. This is critical. Do not hire these people right away.<p>-> Keep track of metrics. Look at active users, activity levels, cohort retention, revenue, etc. Be brutally honest if they don&#x27;t go in the right direction<p>-> If you don&#x27;t get your product right, nothing else in this class will matter.<p>Why start a startup?<p>-> &quot;It&#x27;s glamorous&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ll be the boss&quot;, &quot;Flexibility&quot;, ...<p>-> Entrepreneurship gets romanticized<p>-> The reality is not so glamorous. It is a lot of hard work. You&#x27;re sitting at your desk, focused, figuring out hard engineering projects. It is quite stressful.<p>-> Founder depression is a real thing. If you start a company, it&#x27;s gonna be extremely hard<p>-> You have loads of responsilibity<p>-> You&#x27;re responsible for the opportunity cost of the people who decide to follow and help you out<p>-> You&#x27;re more committed. A founder cannot leave a company. For 10 years if it&#x27;s going well. Probably for 5 years if it&#x27;s not going well.<p>-> &quot;Number one role of a CEO is managing your own psychology&quot;<p>-> You&#x27;re always on call, you&#x27;re a role model. You&#x27;ll always be working anyway<p>-> If you joined Dropbox or Facebook early on, your financial reward might be a lot better than when starting a startup<p>-> If you join a later stage startup, you have more impact - massive userbase, existing infrastructure, work with an established team. E.g. Brett Taylor was employee #1500 at Google and he invented Google Maps. He got a big financial reward for this.<p>-> What&#x27;s the best reason? You can&#x27;t NOT do it. You have to make it happen<p>-> Do it out of passion<p>-> The world needs it (if not, go do something else) and/or the world needs you (you&#x27;re well-suited to do it).

And, if you go back to before the (successful and on-going) attempt to ethnically purge Palestine by European Jewish immigrants, you will see that Jews, and Christians were not persecuted when that land was under Muslim rule.<p>In Israel, only 7% of the land was owned by Jews when the state of Israel was created.  The rest was stolen.  Homes were stolen at gunpoint.  The Israelis repeatedly engage in massacres of the Palestinian and Lebanese civilians to this day.  Resistance should be expected.  And, with the level of violence perpetrated by Israelis, a violent resistance is understandable.<p>The death toll for civilians is pretty lopsided.  In just the massacre of operation cast lead, the Israelis murdered nearly 1500 people, nearly 450 children.  Israel suffered 3 civilian deaths in retribution.  Again and again, the Israelis call for evacuation to U.N. schools, then bomb the schools.  Once a mistake, twice maybe a mistake, but we are well beyond twice.  IDF soldiers wear t-shirts with a picture of a pregnant woman in cross-hairs with (in Hebrew), &quot;one bullet two kills&quot;  Israel recently even apologized (therefore admitted to) harvesting organs from Palestinian prisoners for transplant into Jews.  The Israelis even use their massacre of civilians as a selling point for their weapons exports, &quot;battle tested in Gaza.&quot;  The Israelis are the terrorists by any objective measure.<p>There was a poll in Haaretz that showed overwhelming support by Israelis of the cast lead massacre.  The percentage in support of the massacre was exactly the Jewish population of Israel.  So, complete justification to paint in a very broad brush.<p>The Israelis have Jewish only roads.  And there are around 30 laws that give special treatment to Jews over other citizens.  And, if you want to be truly disgusted, visit some of the Palestinian villages neighboring Jewish settler towns-- you will see things like the Jewish settlers directing their raw sewage into the Palestinian village below (well what is left of the Palestinian village with the constant raids by Jewish terrorist settlers, and Israeli military).  Jewish settlers walk around everywhere with powerful weapons intimidating the Palestinians who are not permitted to do the same.<p>Ugliest place I have ever been (Every Arab I met there was kind and generous, and even in refugee camps, I never heard a hateful word about the Israeli Jews, the other way, I only met two Israeli Jews [out of 10s] who did not make some sort of slur).

If you think eating red meat it bad, and you watch a million people eat red meat or not, and there aren&#x27;t adverse effects, it has given you pretty good evidence red meat isn&#x27;t bad. However, if you see a difference in the red meat group, you still haven&#x27;t shown red meat it bad. The problem is they get used incorrectly all the time, which is why I consider them nearly useless. I actually came to this more nuanced view after having conversations with Dr. Feinman about them. :)<p>I think it&#x27;s a completely valid question to ask why Feinman, Westman, et al, who all have financial ties to the their viewpoint, should be trusted. All scientists are financial vested in their results in some way, so you always have to be careful.<p>(An aside: Dr. Feinman is an interesting case study, though: he was a biochemistry instructor at a medical school. He had no training in nutrition at all. Because of the biochemistry, he taught his students that fat is a great energy source and too many carbs are dangerous. At some point, he was told he wasn&#x27;t allowed to teach that anymore, because it went against the nutrition orthodoxy (even though it followed the biochemistry), which was when he entered the nutrition arena.)<p>Fortunately, we have better methods than check stubs to determine whether to accept something. I look at declarations as indicators of possible bias, but, in the end, a study is good or it is not good. It&#x27;s unfortunate that it literally requires reading and understanding scientific studies if you want to figure this stuff out, because it is all so bogged down in politics and economics. It&#x27;s even more unfortunate that many studies get a lot of press that fall squarely in the &quot;not good&quot; category.<p>I&#x27;ve seen great studies come from researchers who set out to &quot;prove&quot; vegetarianism was the best diet. I&#x27;ve seen great studies from people paid by Atkins and by Ornish (a noted very low fat vegetarian proponent). Some of the worst studies I&#x27;ve seen have come out of Harvard, but even those aren&#x27;t uniformly bad.<p>The weird thing about nutrition is there is this huge disconnect between the science and the organization supposedly representing the science. The American Heart Association has studies that show saturated fat is not unhealthy, yet, as an organization, it continues its zeitgeist against it. The science is clear that sugar is absolutely horrible for diabetics, yet the ADA continues to tell diabetics it&#x27;s fine to eat. Registered dietitians get continuing education credits from classes literally taught by McDonalds and CocaCola.<p>I cannot say with complete confidence that it is <i>because of</i> their sponsors, but I do think, at a minimum, the influence of corporate sponsorship as a factor in resisting change is a reasonable hypothesis that fits the data better than any other hypothesis.<p>So, is it possible that the ADA doesn&#x27;t come out strongly for a low carb diet for Type 2 diabetics for a reason other than the fact they get most of their sponsorship money from companies that produce insulin and other diabetes drugs? Sure.  A certain amount of it is inertia based on old, bad science, but I think the sponsorship money acts as a huge anchor, keeping that inertia in place.",1411520918

The original question I replied to was about why pipes (or any OS-level IPC) shouldn&#x27;t try to solve application-level problems.<p>My arguments are that the OS&#x27;s IPC <i>should not</i> enforce an IPC record structure, but <i>should</i> enforce a consistent set of IPC access methods (i.e. pipes, sockets, shared memory, message queues, etc.) defined independently of applications.  I think we&#x27;re in agreement about the latter--if the OS were to let each application have it&#x27;s own IPC access methods, then there would be as many access methods as there are applications (leading to tightly-coupled &quot;truly monolithic mess&quot;).<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve reached agreement on the former.  I claimed that there is no &quot;best record structure&quot; for all applications, so the OS shouldn&#x27;t try to enforce one.  I also mentioned that human-readable text is the universal data format, which is both a manifestation of this principle (i.e. the OS imposes no constraints on the structure of bytes passed between programs) and a desirable outcome since parsing text is super-simple to implement (by contrast, take a look at the examples in dbus-send(1) to see how painful the alternative can be).  You disagree--you think the IPC system should also handle things like serialization and validation.<p>The problem is that serialization and validation are both application-specific (and even context-specific) concerns, and for the IPC system to address them, it has to gain knowledge from the application.  But this lets the application set IPC access methods, which we&#x27;ve already agreed is a bad idea!  My (extreme) example to prove this point was that pushing validation responsibility from the application into the IPC system would require it to handle ridiculous application-specific corner cases, like defining a socket class that makes sure that your bank account password won&#x27;t be sent to the wrong host (still not sure how you concluded that that remark was about systemd).  The point is, if you want your IPC system to handle validation for you, you&#x27;re just asking for trouble.<p>The same type of problem occurs when you put serialization into the IPC system.  The serializer has to know whether or not a string of bytes represents a valid application-defined record.  If you make serialization the IPC system&#x27;s responsibility, it needs application-level knowledge on whether or not an inbound message represents a valid message (which also leads to ridiculous corner cases).<p>DBus not only enforces structured records (bad), but also lets applications define their own IPC access methods (worse).  The RPC-like nature of DBus means that both peers must not only agree on the interpretation of bytes in advance, but also agree on the semantics of accessing them.  Unlike reading from a pipe, accessing the value of a DBus object by name can have arbitrary side-effects which the requester must be aware of.  In the limit, this puts us into the undesirable situation of having each application-to-application pair agree on an IPC access method, leading to the tight coupling nightmare.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong--DBus has its use-cases.  OS-level IPC isn&#x27;t one of them.  I wish systemd folks took some time to think about this, but they&#x27;re too busy trying to <i>make</i> DBus into OS-level IPC with no regards to the consequences.  See kdbus and the SOCK_BUS socket class it exports.<p>Now, nitpicks:<p>> But you know what? DBus is basically human readible with a bit more imposed structure than generic streams<p>/me falls out of chair too.<p>Now you&#x27;re just being daft :)  The more structure you impose on bytes, the less human-readable it gets.  For example, I don&#x27;t think I have to explain to you why this comment is more legible as rendered in your browser (unstructured text) than as raw HTML (structured records).<p>> DBus isn&#x27;t the new shiny.

That means a whole bunch of object files are going to be functionally different between debug and release builds, though, which is annoying for a lot of operational reasons.)<p>My favourite solution by far, though, is the one recently implemented by Elixir: log() is a regular function, but takes a closure instead of a string. That way, you can actually put all the work required to <i>generate</i> the log message (inspecting data structures, doing intermediate lookups, etc.) inside the closure, and it <i>all</i> gets elided when you decrease the log-level.",1411520604
