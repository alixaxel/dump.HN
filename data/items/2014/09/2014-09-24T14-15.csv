8361805,comment,8360456,8360456,1,0,yatoomy,,,"I dont believe it is over...more so we must adapt to the last stage. Information technology has largely become interchangeable with the term &quot;technology&quot;, since it has become so wide spread. However, this has created an opportunity and a predicament. With all this data generated...now what? We have a connected world, medical grade devices and senors on our body and a super computer in our pocket...yet people continue to make photo and messaging apps. Partly because some want, and others perhaps don&#x27;t know what to do. When analyzing these kinds of questions, I try to remember we are building for people. People use the technology. People have wants and needs. Having a frame work for these helps alot. I use Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of human needs as a general use case. That perhaps we are at a point of actualization. Where we have fulfilled all the required parts of pyramid before it. I hope this is the case, because this is when true innovation will begin. Areas like education, healthcare and finance would be prime in this case. Just a thought :)",1411570766

When I&#x27;m reading an article I really don&#x27;t care about navigating to the rest of the site. I have a small widescreen laptop, which means that the fixed headers at the top give me less room to read the article. I don&#x27;t need gobs of white space to read the news article in print, so why is white space so important on the web that navigation has to be hidden in one of those awful hamburger buttons? The text is harder to read because it has lower contrast. The new comment system is totally unusable. I don&#x27;t really appreciate large, useless images interrupting the flow of the article. And I don&#x27;t need Javascript to read a newspaper article (the site loads like a pig with Javascript) because I&#x27;m going to be navigating to a different page when I read another article.

Great for building products; terrible for selling them.<p>A businessperson&#x27;s mindset is &quot;if they don&#x27;t understand their value proposition well enough to explain it to me, their product likely isn&#x27;t any better than the competition and they know it.&quot; Better still, by explaining your value proposition in terms of a prospective client&#x27;s problems, you are showing them that 1) you understand their problems 2) your product addresses their problems and 3) that you are committed to a long-term, mutually beneficial business relationship, not just a sale.<p>OP&#x27;s link is a great example of good business communication. It&#x27;s obvious that many of the flaws are due to the anonymization; I&#x27;ve written these e-mails before and the main goal is building a business relationship based on trust.

Sure, you can make certain kinds of decision making processes illegal, but it doesn&#x27;t change the hearts and minds of the people making those decisions. As has been said here already, this only pushes those processes out of the public eye and into the private space. Those who would discriminate on illegal grounds will always be able to manufacture plausible deniability, which the posted article clearly demonstrates.<p>We&#x27;d all like to think we&#x27;re better. That&#x27;s what leads us down the path of legislating out way out of prejudice. It&#x27;s not a solution. To me, the article suggests an alternative way to fight it: information. Forget equal opportunity, affirmative action, whatever label you want to put on it. Publishing the data, putting a name with the prejudice on display for everyone to see, is the proper fight. Then the people who profit from the prejudice, and those who participate in the system, can be pressured to change. Failing that, society can marginalize them.",1411570507

But, then, I give credit to most HNers for having the ability to read beyond the obvious and understand the real question being asked, and the real issue at hand. Those who engage in higher thinking often assume that the obvious is a given, and that the real matter must lie elsewhere. They would therefore be unlikely to commit, say, the faux pas of restating the obvious as a conclusion.<p>Thankfully, many HNers are able to engage in such higher thinking. There is a small percentage, however, who generally seem very nearly oblivious. But, they typically announce themselves through their misguided, yet uncannily self-assured comments.",1411570498

I think it has a lot going for it, but I do agree that it&#x27;s a pretty dense language, and that will cause problems in uptake for real projects.<p>Many of those real projects can&#x27;t use anything easier than Rust. Sure, using a GC for everything is easier, allowing memory safety violations is easier, and allowing data races is easier (for some definition of &quot;easy&quot;). But for many projects, like browser engines, kernels, games, etc. neither of these are an option. In other words, avoiding new concepts comes at a price. The concepts in Rust aren&#x27;t there for no reason; they&#x27;re there because they&#x27;re solving real problems.<p>(Incidentally, I don&#x27;t think that &quot;simpler&quot; is the right term; I think there&#x27;s a lot of confusion between &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;easy&quot;.)",1411570487

This type notation, under Qi&#x27;s interpretation, is actually a Turing complete language in its own right. This notation allows Qi to assign extensible type systems to Common Lisp libraries and is thought of as an extremely powerful feature of the language.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(programming_language)</a><p>What also interests me is that, unlike Java or Scala, adding types is optional, so the types can be layered in. I prefer that style, because when I face a new problem that I have never faced before, I feel that adding type information suggests I know something that I don&#x27;t actually know. I prefer to add types to a function, once I&#x27;ve come to understand what role a function should play in regards to the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve. In that way, the type information also communicates what I have learned about the problem I am trying to solve, versus the areas of my problem that I am still ignorant about, and whose code I can leave untyped while I figure things out.<p>I am also intrigued by what fogus has written:<p>&quot;Qi (and its successor Shen) really push the limits of what we might call a Fluchtpunkt Lisp. I suspect it requires a categorization of its own. A few years ago I was looking for a Lisp to dive into and my searching uncovered two extremely interesting options: Clojure and Qi. I eventually went with Clojure, but in the intervening time I’ve managed to spend quality time with Qi and I love what I’ve seen so far. Qi’s confluence of features, including an optional type system (actually, its type system might be more accurately classified as “skinnable”), pattern matching,3 and an embedded logic engine based on Prolog, make it a very compelling choice indeed.&quot;<p><a href=""http://blog.fogus.me/2011/05/03/the-german-school-of-lisp-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.fogus.me/2011/05/03/the-german-school-of-lisp-2/</a><p>Just recently, here on Hacker News, we had posted an example of a step-by-step explanation of adding types to a working Shen app:<p><a href=""http://www.shenlanguage.org/library/shenpaper.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shenlanguage.org/library/shenpaper.pdf</a><p>Someone in the comments on Hacker News highlighted this comment, by the original author of the untyped app:<p>&quot;No, I didn&#x27;t think about writing typed version of this program. You know, I&#x27;m not &quot;disciplined&quot; kind of person so \ntype discipline is (for now) pretty foreign to me. :) I have the strange feeling that types hampers programmer&#x27;s \ncreativity.&quot;<p>Mark Taver responded with his own thoughts, which I thought were interesting:<p>&quot;The underlined sentence is a compact summary of the reluctance that programmers often feel in migrating to  statically typed languages – that they are losing something, a degree of freedom that the writer identifies as  hampering creativity. Is this true? I will argue, to a degree – yes. A type checker for a functional language is in essence, an  inference engine; that is to say, it is the machine embodiment of some formal system of proof. What we know,  and have known since Godel&#x27;s incompleteness proof [9] [11], is that the human ability to recognise truth transcends our ability to capture it formally. In computing terms our ability to recognise something as correct predates and can transcend our attempt to formalise the logic of our program. Type checkers are not smarter  than human programmers, they are simply faster and more reliable, and our willingness to be subjugated to them arises from a motivation to ensure our programs work. That said, not all type checkers are equal. The more rudimentary and limited our formal system, the more we may have to compromise on our natural coding impulses. A powerful type system and inference engine can mitigate the constraints placed on what Racketnoob terms our creativity. At the same time a sophisticated system makes more demands of the programmer in terms of understanding.&quot;",1411569972

8361623,comment,8361101,8361319,6,0,jeffreyrogers,,,"> People literally spend all their time doing this, if there was free money to be made someone would be making it:)<p>I agree with everything you said above, including this. I want to add though, that there is effectively free money in the stock market. For example, just by buying a low-fee index fund (e.g. something from Vanguard), you&#x27;re almost guaranteed to do better than most investors and probably better than nearly all speculators. (And there are other investment strategies that typically outperform the indices as well). I guess the reason people do poorly in the stock market is similar to why people start dumb startups that don&#x27;t really have any hope of being profitable: The idea of rapidly creating an enormous amount of money for very little effort in a very short amount of time is much more appealing than making 12+% per year indefinitely, even though this strategy is much more likely to net you a higher return in the long-run... plus you actually have to save money if you want to invest this way :)<p>Edit: It&#x27;s also interesting to learn about how some of the big quant trading firms started. D.E. Shaw, for example, originally had some bond trading algorithms they used. It was very profitable and the hours were short compared to the rest of the Wall Street/Finance world. Then they got greedy and tried some more aggressive strategies, blew up, and nearly lost the fund. Fortunately for them they seem to be doing much better now, though I&#x27;m not sure what their current strategy is.",1411568838

8361533,comment,8355170,8358235,2,0,cyphunk,,,"I live in Berlin, Germany&#x27;s largest city and most liberal(?) city, which is where the PDF is largely focused. The problem is that unlike a media-hyperbolic society such as the US where meme&#x27;s travel fast, Germany is a bit more civil and people mostly mind their own business. This brings its own benefits and problems. The problem being that most citizens believe the state of discrimination to be what they have seen (as you will notice from many comments of Germans here and other places). When in-fact in a meme based society eventually stories of real discrimination would become more widely understood.<p>When I talk to people here about the problem of discrimination in the education system few believe it at first. A stalwart all people here hold is that their education system is &quot;great&quot;. The stats even for the general population, not accounting for different classes or races, brings that into stark question. Until you relay to them the stories then they start consider it more closely. Then they may start to see that the Gymnasium system meant to promote excellence is actually just a Cast system. Being that promotion to Gymnasium is dependent on a letter from a students teacher. If nothing else tacit discrimination a result of the natural psychology to favor the familiar helps found unfair results.<p>Prior to the Information Era the Gymnasium / Hauptschule system had a function as professional labor was highly valued. This is no longer the case and not getting into a Gymnasium has stronger psychological effect than it would have before.  This system, for this era, is discriminatory at its base.<p>Consider The Pygmaliom Effect [1] (aka self-fulfilling prophesy) that proves measured aptitude is dependent on confidence and attention within the education system. Here in Germany you have a system that reaffirm the predefined bias against immigrants and you don&#x27;t give them attention so they don&#x27;t perform as well.<p>At least in Berlin, there is evidence that teachers and headmasters of Gymnasiums are just blatantly racist. Consider the arguments some made against Affirmative Action for Gymnasium enrollment in 2011 [2]:<p><pre><code>    Headmasters have objected, saying this type of policy would be\n    &quot;a disservice&quot; to poor children, that they would not be able\n    to keep up academically. The headmasters have also expressed\n    concerns that children of working-class families would not\n    feel welcome at gymnasien. Wolfgang Harnischfeger, headmaster\n    of a well-known Berlin gymnasium, has stated:\n\n        It can be noticed in children as young as kindergarten\n        students, that children take after their parents. They\n        emulate their language, their way of dressing, their way\n        of spending their free time. Kids from Neukölln [a poor\n        neighbourhood] would not feel good about themselves if they\n        had to attend a type of school that mainly serves students\n        from social classes different from their own. They will\n        not be able to integrate. Every field day, every school\n        party will show that&quot;.\n\n</code></pre>\nEffectively this headmaster is saying his school is racist so immigrants wont feel comfortable. The situation is not going to get better. In 2011 Berlin finally reformed their system requiring %30 of seats in Gymnasium be randomly selected. From any angle you look at it, this measure is too little and completely awkward. It doesn&#x27;t address the ability of teachers to keep qualified students out by not giving them a letter. It doesn&#x27;t deal with the structure in Gymnasiums that segregate children. It doesn&#x27;t deal with the problem that very early in your life you are told whether you are worth of University or not.<p>I feel most Europeans want to protect their idea that whatever problems they hear about in the US, that they don&#x27;t have anything similar. It&#x27;s convenient and comfortable but absolutely blind.<p>1: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect#Rosenthal.E2.80.93Jacobson_study"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect#Rosenthal.E2....</a><p>2: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_%28Germany%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gymnasium_%28Germany%29</a>",1411568047

Manufacturers, especially Apple, hate to do this because it reveals the secret design in advance of the dramatic release event.

Many of us would not complain about an extra millimeter or two of thickness, especially if it means a bigger battery and some nice-to-haves such as a memory card slot.  Thinness is costly, too.  Make it an indestructible brick, charge less, and millions will continue to buy the devices.<p>- An alternative view:  yield to bendiness!

With so called &quot;Basic Current Accounts&quot; (accounts with no overdraft/borrowing facility) being available even to people with horrible/no credit at all.<p>The way UK banks make money on current accounts is via interest (the difference between the Bank of England rate and their rate, the spread). They can also charge non-basic current account customers for things like unagreed overdrafts and so on.<p>I don&#x27;t really understand why current accounts in the US cost $12-8/month. It isn&#x27;t like &quot;checking accounts&quot; in the US have much better interest rates. So they&#x27;re likely double-dipping (getting $ off of the spread AND fees).<p>Plus a lot of US banks require you to have a savings account with $x in it on top of your &quot;checking account&quot; just to waive the fee. Which means they&#x27;re still double dipping there too, the spread on both the savings in the savings account (their &quot;savings&quot; accounts have horrible interest rates) and any money in the &quot;checking account.&quot;<p>This is also making it easy for fraudsters to move money. Since there are no &quot;basic bank accounts&quot; for the poor, throw-away/burner debit cards have become common which fraudsters can move stolen money onto and then spend it freely (as those cards have no ID check, etc).<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on how big of a scam the throw-away/burner debit cards are.
