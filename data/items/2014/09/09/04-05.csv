That allows us to avoid magic numbers as a (horrible) workaround.<p>What do dependent types gain us?<p>[Edit]<p>Rather than clutter up the thread, I&#x27;ll thank everyone here for the detailed responses below. Really, really interesting stuff.<p>> All of the functions above depend crucially upon the compile time invariant of having a fixed size list. They therefore work for any type-homogenous tuple, for instance, but we&#x27;d have to define the functions for each tuple independently.

8288797,comment,8288506,8288783,8,0,nether,,,"The annoying thing with CFD with analyzing viscous phenomena is the question of reproducibility. Flow structures in this regime (low Re, that is low speed and small length scales) are notoriously sensitive to surface defects, e.g. the hairs being analyzed. A CFD sim will show nearly the same results for a given problem, and current CFD lacks the fidelity to really model tiny turbulent features at these scales as well as the necessary fine surface definition. Experimental results may show drastically different results depending on the minute upstream flow variations, and surface quality: in this case, legs with hair/sweat/dust/oils could all trip the boundary layer to varying degrees.
