8289390,comment,8289273,8289378,1,0,luckyisgood,,,"The way I see this &quot;clients do or do not need support&quot; is this (and this metaphor faired well with clients, to help them understand why support and maintenance is absolutely crucial): I personally don&#x27;t need medical insurance either because I&#x27;m healthy most of the time. But what happens when I get sick? I need fast remedy and I want to live my life assured that there&#x27;s a team of experts on standby, ready to take me in.<p>In my experience, it made no sense to argue with the client about maintenance when the website was &quot;sick&quot;. All the client wanted was for us to fix it. I knew that, so I made sure I sold them a maintenance package in advance, when they &quot;didn&#x27;t need&quot; it. A website is just like a bridge: if you build it, you&#x27;re responsible for it, but it&#x27;s not for free. Everything I put in the world, I am responsible for, but the client needs to pay for it.<p>Here&#x27;s how we sold support:\n- 30 days guarantee period (after launch)\n- we were selling only annual contracts. A lot happens every month. Frameworks and libraries need updating, 404 links happen, browsers update, CMS systems get new security updates... There&#x27;s a ton of things to keep an eye on as a developer, and you could create an annual plan which your client pays for monthly (give her a discount when she signs a contract).",1410256676

My platform of choice (MOAI) is Lua-based, and in my development environment I can treat all of the hosts that it runs on - Windows, Linux, OSX, Android, iOS, HTML5+javascript - the same.  There is no walled garden in this technique - any time I want to test on a platform, I simply send the existing app a link to a new source bundle, and off we go.<p>The <i>only</i> time this doesn&#x27;t work is of course the appstore-approval phase - things have to be precompiled and bundled properly into a signable package.  Oh well, just a part of release engineering.  But other than that, its just a push-button away to get new versions of my apps installed on all the test devices in the lab..",1410256365

8289369,comment,8289273,8289273,6,0,luckyisgood,,,"Web agency founder with a decade of experience in selling websites here. I wrote a book on the subject of recurring revenue for web agencies and web professionals, all based on our experience.<p>Here&#x27;s what worked for us:<p>- after selling a website, we sold the mandatory support and maintenance contract. We considered this service the foundation, or level one of our recurring revenue stream. This is fairly easy to sell and renew. The recurring revenue we got from this was enough to keep us afloat.<p>- after selling support and maintenance, we upsold the client to &quot;levele two&quot;: services which grow our client&#x27;s online business. The types of services we offered in this plan: everything that needs to be done to reach client&#x27;s business goals, and that we could deliver well. This was harder to sell (because the type of client needs to be just right for this kind of service), but the amount of money coming in every month is substantial. This is what makes the agency grow in long term.<p>Here&#x27;s what didn&#x27;t work for us:<p>- web hosting. We&#x27;ve been offering this for more than a decade and in the end, all things considered, it is just not worth it. A combination of support + maintenance + growth-oriented services is a much better bang for the buck. We sold most of our servers and hosting accounts to a specialized hosting company and focused on what we did best.<p>For the exact details about building, pricing and selling support and maintenance services, check out my book: <a href=""https://www.simpfinity.com/books/recurring-revenue-web-agencies/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.simpfinity.com/books/recurring-revenue-web-agenc...</a> (the part about growth-oriented services is coming soon, matter of weeks)<p>I love talking about the subject of recurring revenue, it&#x27;s a passion of mine.
