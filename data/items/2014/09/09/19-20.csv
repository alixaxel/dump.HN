8292513,comment,8291662,8291875,1,0,nilkn,,,"I&#x27;d estimate at least 50% of all the times I look at my smartphone throughout the day are non-interactive uses--I&#x27;m checking on a notification, the time, or just the weather. I&#x27;ve been seriously looking into smartwatches lately as a way to eliminate this friction. It&#x27;s not just an inconvenience -- it&#x27;s awkward to pull out your phone repeatedly during dinner, for instance, just to see if it vibrated due to a critical work email or a BS Snapchat message that you don&#x27;t care about.<p>It&#x27;s the same reason the wristwatch itself was invented. It was preceded by detached timepieces that were stored in coat pockets. The pocket-to-wrist chasm was enough to merit creating wristwatches, and I think it&#x27;s enough to merit smartwatches.",1410292793

On the Apple Watch, you&#x27;re going to use it all the time.<p>It&#x27;s not even that I couldn&#x27;t use my right hand, it&#x27;s that I don&#x27;t want a bulky $350 gadget permanently strapped to my left hand, which I frequently use for doing things. Great recipe for (best case) being irritating, or (worst case) getting smashed into stuff.<p>Maybe it can be rotated 180° to go on a right arm? It&#x27;d mean the button and crown positions are backward, but it&#x27;d be better than nothing. I see no mention of that option anywhere, so for now I assume you can&#x27;t.<p>Either way, doesn&#x27;t support the 4S, costs more than I&#x27;m willing to spend, and will hopefully get thinner in future releases.

8292498,comment,8288682,8289401,3,0,physPop,,,"I am critical of your arguments for many reasons. They are not well reasoned, poorly communicated, and predicated on an &quot;anti-fetish&quot; as you so eloquently put it.<p>1) False. Go look it up.\n2) The site doesn&#x27;t include a year of work post graduation. This is a bad comparison.\n3) False. I believe their placement rate is ~98% or so, check their website. Also, never cite &quot;I know a friend...&quot;, anecdotal evidence is almost worse than no evidence.\n4) False. Rankings are a bad metric to assess research prominence, as research quality varies markedly across departments. Additionally, research prowess is likely diametrically opposed to the goals of a student seeking an undergrad education in a co-op focused program.\n5) Yup. Still a deal for internationals though. \n6) Wholesomeness of research ideals aside, industry funding is key for applied research. The government is certainly not going to fund compiler research, or work on applied group theory. I suggest you reconsider this idealism. We have rules that all donations and research grants need to be reported, so you can look this up. All large universities in north america with good research programs in engineering typically have strong funding from large corporations.<p>That being said, I am in no way affiliated with UW, other than being an academic, and knowing well about their excellent reputation in research and in placement rates for their math/cs/eng undergrads. Many large firms recruit from the Woo that do not in fact recruit from pretentious British schools.<p>Why? Simple: \nIt is well known that the &#x27;elite&#x27; universities suffer from drastic grade inflation. Strong co-op programs provide employers with significant extra data about potential employees. What kind of projects did they work on? What are their work reviews like? Grades and university ranking/brand are nearly meaningless these days -- see pg&#x27;s excellent essay on this topic.",1410292703

This lack of generality didn&#x27;t help LALR:  right recursion is damn useful for describing right associativity, and LALR can&#x27;t do it.<p>This is why I&#x27;m so excited about Earley parsing.  It&#x27;s not too slow, it&#x27;s fully general (no corner case whatsoever), it can support prioritised choice, context sensitivity, and stellar error messages thanks to the table of partial parses it maintains.<p>We can now combine the power and convenience of PEGs with the generality of Earley parsing.  Once that&#x27;s done, nobody will ever look back to LALR, or even plain old recursive descent —except for <i>really</i> simple tasks.  I think Marpa is only the beginning.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMeta"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OMeta</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/metacompilers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loup-vaillant.fr/projects/metacompilers/</a>",1410292120

The most interesting people I know didn&#x27;t know at 22 what they wanted to do with their lives. Some of the most interesting 40-year-olds I know still don&#x27;t.</i><p>...and this is true.<p>It is human nature to compare ourselves to others. That is how we measure our own progress. We don&#x27;t measure it in absolute terms -- we do not tend to say, &quot;I have four more units of happy this year than I had last year,&quot; instead we tend to say, &quot;those other people get to take vacations all around the world, and I don&#x27;t.&quot;<p>And so we strive to have what other people have.<p>This effect can be especially poisonous in environments like HN, where you see so many examples of bright, young, successful people, especially those that are more successful than you. And so you look at yourself and you think, &quot;all I have is this uninspiring, unimportant job, and those people are making a difference, and that&#x27;s what I want to do, but I don&#x27;t know how.&quot;<p>It is a cruel unspoken truth of reality that a major part of success and difference-making is based on no small amount of luck. Sometimes -- maybe most of the time, maybe even all of the time -- making a difference, or becoming wildly successful, is a matter of simply doing the right thing when you are in the right place at the right time.<p>It certainly cannot be forced, despite what a few notable examples might lead you to believe.<p>So if you love coding, then code, and if you ever stop loving coding, then stop coding and try to find your next life (<a href=""http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2722#comic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=2722#comic</a>). I have done this a few times, and it scares the piss out of me every time, and every time I love it and I would never go back and choose not to do it. I have met the most amazing people because I did something unexpected.<p>And if you are lucky, you will find sufficient happiness in coding and stability and you will have a comfortable life and you will find your rewards in yearly vacations, hobbies, and maybe family. Or, if you are lucky, you will look inside yourself and realize that you could never be happy enough having just all of that, and you will strike out into a more frightening and unknown future; maybe you will try your hand at your own startup, maybe you will fail, maybe you&#x27;ll try again, and maybe as a result of all of that you&#x27;ll never get those vacations or that family, but at least you will have tried and that will make you happy.<p>If you are unlucky, then you will do one when you should have done the other. Try not to do that.<p>But most importantly, and I want to say this with all of the conviction that I can muster:<p><i>Do not be in a hurry.</i><p>I can very nearly promise that if you wait until you are 25 to start something of your own, you will be just as happy with the result as you would have been at 21. The four years from 21 to 25 seems significant at 21, and utterly insignificant at 30. By the time you are 50, you&#x27;ll find it funny how much pressure young people place on themselves to grow up more quickly.<p>Do not dismiss your own troubles, they are as important to you as finding dinner is to other people.

8292297,comment,8290681,8290681,6,0,haberman,,,"Marpa looks interesting. But I am not sure about this claim in the paper:<p>> Despite the promise of general context-free parsing, and the strong academic literature behind it, it has never been incorporated into a highly available tool like those that exist for LALR[6] or regular expressions.<p>I think this leaves out several such tools (and there are probably more):<p><pre><code>    1. Bison (supports GLR since at least 2009)\n    2. Elkhound (GLR parser generator, since 2002)\n    3. ANTLR (its top-down ALL(*) algorithm is general)\n</code></pre>\nBut let’s step back a second. Is generalized context-free parsing really the holy grail that some people think it is?<p>For non-parser-geeks, “generalized” means “can handle all grammars.” That sure <i>seems</i> like a feature, especially for people suffering PTSD from unhelpful Bison error messages like “shift-reduce conflict.” The idea of never having to see a message like that again can sure make generalized parsing seem pretty damn attractive (btw: this is the same selling point for PEGs).<p>But the dark side of generalized parsing is ambiguity. It is undecidable whether a given grammar is ambiguous or not.<p>Here’s what this means, in practical terms. Generalized tools might save you from “shift-reduce conflict,” but they cannot save you from “this grammar might be ambiguous, and it’s impossible to say.”<p>So what? Well this means ambiguities can be hiding in your grammar that you don’t know about.  Ambiguities mean that certain syntactical constructs could have two possible meanings, and which one the parser chooses is totally arbitrary.<p>The best real-life example of this is the “dangling else” ambiguity: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dangling_else</a>  Everybody knows about it now, but when it was originally introduced into ALGOL 60, it went totally unnoticed. The language had even been published in a technical report before anyone was aware that the ambiguity existed.<p>Now I agree that “shift-reduce conflict” sucks, but to me “parser tools should accept any grammar” is an overreaction. That’s like saying “syntax errors in JavaScript suck, we should make the parser accept anything and try to do something reasonable.” If that idea gives you the heebie jeebies, you’ll know how I feel about generalized parsing.<p>To me the answer isn’t generalized parsing, it’s a parsing formalism and tool that, when it gives you an error, gives you enough information to know <i>exactly</i> what the issue is. The tool can be your helper as you develop your grammar/language, helping you understand whether your language is ambiguous or not and how to fix your ambiguities. When it accepts your grammar, you can have confidence that your language and grammar are unambiguous.<p>Now at least generalized CFG algorithms (like GLR and Marpa) can tell you at runtime that the input is ambiguous. PEGs can’t even do that: they just define the ambiguity away by saying “in cases of ambiguity, the first alternative wins by definition.” Sure it makes the <i>formalism</i> unambiguous, but the language as your users experience it is still just as ambiguous.<p>I wrote about this all in more detail here: <a href=""http://blog.reverberate.org/2013/09/ll-and-lr-in-context-why-parsing-tools.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.reverberate.org/2013/09/ll-and-lr-in-context-why...</a>",1410291763

It looks like Apple is finally bumping this up! This means a bit more text can fit on each line when holding the phone vertically for websites using <meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width&quot;>:<p>- iPhone 6 is 1334x750: CSS pixel width is likely 375px (pixel ratio = 2)<p>- iPhone 6 Plus is 1920x1080: CSS pixel width is likely either 432px (pixel ratio = 2.5) or 360px (pixel ratio = 3). It would make sense to implement a ratio of 2.5 as it would be 15.2% more CSS pixels for a screen 17.0% wider. But on the other hand (1) Apple designers are perfectionists and a fractional ratio means an image slightly less sharp, and (2) maybe with the Plus model Apple wants to attract smartphone buyers who dislike tiny text on a tiny display so it would make sense to provide fewer CSS pixels on a bigger screen...

This is an opportunity, not a burden - you gain <i>far</i> stronger job-finding skills than you would if you already had an impressive background.<p>Waterloo taught me more about hustle, presentation, honesty, spin, negotiation, and many other skills I&#x27;d never have learned had I already had strong credentials.

I think the answer is more applicable here though.<p>Repost:\nI was gifted a Pebble over a year ago and I admit I thought it was a bit of a gimmick at the time. I did however start wear it out of consideration for the person that gave it to me and the novelty of a new toy. :) (note too that I am an old-timer who still wears a watch regularly)<p>What happened however surprised me. I found the simple change of having notifications pop up on my wrist was saving me from pulling the phone out of its holder over and over during a day every time it chimed with an email or message. I get a ton of communication during the day but 70% of it doesn&#x27;t require a response from me immediately... the remaining 30% however does. I was now able to filter incoming messages with barely an interruption to what I was doing at the time.<p>From there I expanded Apps to bringing up my calendar overview, putting navigation directions on my wrist, using silent alarms (wrist vibration) to alert me during meetings, etc. It allows me to be more connected to my phone, without being more connected to my phone, if you know what I mean.<p>I have since moved to an LG watch and I do like it. No more week long battery life but it will go well over a day easily. Lots more gimmicky applications like remote camera control, etc. but also useful things, like ticking items off my Keep grocery list as I wander the store... without holding my phone.<p>Is it perfect for everyone? Nothing is. But I will stand corrected for my early mocking of the form factor. I &quot;don&#x27;t leave home without it&quot; now.<p>Edit: One other point I missed.  I also wander around the house without carrying my phone anymore.  The watch stays connected and I can get alerts without needing to have it beside me.",1410290875

Some people say the point is not to find the meaning of life but to make your life meaningful. Others prefer to just enjoy the ride and make the most of it. Your mileage may vary and nobody knows what paths your life will want to take.<p>But there&#x27;s one thing that makes life so vivid and that is death.<p>Without death you would never reach even a partial conclusion of what to do here because you just wouldn&#x27;t be bothered to and you would be procrastinating instead for your whole life. Death conveniently and equally applies to everyone, and it makes you think about what really matters for you in your life.<p>The unescapable end of your life may seem like a long way ahead for someone who&#x27;s 21 years old but when you&#x27;re older it feels that was just a moment ago when you actually were 21. Years go by quicker than you think, and each year you will be thinking about it more and, most importantly, prioritizing your life accordingly.<p>Some people see it coming early, and make a better life of theirs after that realization. Some people hit it late, but that&#x27;s all right too because <i>eventually you will</i> not only merely know but also realize, with all the cells in your body, that you won&#x27;t be here forever. For real. And why that matters is because you know you can&#x27;t fool yourself anymore.<p>And suddenly then some things don&#x27;t matter anymore and other things really start to matter. You will see for yourself at the time but I&#x27;m willing to bet a lot that your career won&#x27;t be one of your key questions.<p>Rather, it sounds to me that what you were really worrying about was whether you will &quot;never ever create something that truly changes the world&quot;. But that may or may not involve your career: you don&#x27;t know it yet. Life unfolds in most unexpected ways: if only you go with whatever works for you, you will bump into something that <i>truly changes your world</i>.<p>And it is then you know what you will do with the rest of your life.",1410290739

I never went to University, came out of school at 18 to find a barren job market where I couldn&#x27;t get a job because I had no experience and couldn&#x27;t get experience because I had no job.<p>I eventually managed to get a job (onsite IT support) after 9 months of unemployment and held it for 2 years, until I finally got fed up of it and decided to find a job doing web development. I found one working for a design agency and moved out of my parents&#x27; house to go work here.<p>Once again, this was a boring job. I eventually ended up getting fired from this job (due to unrealistic expectations of a junior developer on the employer&#x27;s part) and was unemployed for 8 months.<p>After 8 months, I started working at my current place of work, I moved closer to work in February and really enjoy it. Best of all, I get to have an impact on people&#x27;s lives for the better (education software).<p>I guess the point I&#x27;m trying to make is that yes, while we all go through shitty patches, it&#x27;s those experiences that make us who we are and what we go on to do.

Although my story&#x27;s different, we&#x27;re in the same boat.<p>I graduated last month, 2nd in my class for computer science. I previously interviewed with Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Twitter -- all rejections! It was super depressing. One of my only friends at school landed a job at Twitter and his GPA was much lower than mine, he didn&#x27;t work as hard, and now he gets paid 50% more than I do. Yes, 50% more, no exaggerations. Fuck me, right? haha<p>So what am I doing now? I started my first full-time software engineer job last Tuesday with the same Fortune 500 retailer I did internships and co-ops with in the past. I code business applications for the company, it&#x27;s fun but not super interesting. I&#x27;m making good money -- not top dollar, but a fair salary (maybe a little lower than I expected for having 4 internships before graduation, but still.)<p>The real world is boring and no matter what work you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s probably not going to be super interesting. Think of it this way, even Google needs teams to do their boring work... I&#x27;m sure there are bored people at Google getting paid much much more than me (and you)!<p>Needless to say, I&#x27;m not excited about my job. I&#x27;m excited about getting paid, but work is work. I&#x27;m working with the frameworks and languages that I want and I think that&#x27;s all that really matters in the end.<p>The last thing you need to keep in mind is that the work you&#x27;re going to do, as a programmer/engineer, will most likely NOT change the world. Company&#x27;s taglines like &quot;Come Change The World With Us&quot; -- shit like this -- is used so you think their company is doing great things, but they really aren&#x27;t doing anything great. They use these strategies to attract top talent. It&#x27;s the same reason Target and Coke use the color &#x27;Red&#x27; to sell their products via their label (red means cheap!) Honestly, if you really want to change the world, change professions... and remember, becoming rich != changing the world -- you could own a sweet startup that does nothing more than sends &quot;Yo!&quot; to a friend on your friends list, but this doesn&#x27;t change the world.<p>So what can you do now that you&#x27;re bored and you&#x27;re fortunate enough to have a job in this economy? My suggestion is to work on something you really care about on the side. Make a project for yourself or work on an open source project that you think is helpful or &quot;world changing&quot;. Live your life day by day and every now and then think about &quot;how can I make my life easier&quot; -- and build something that does make it easier.<p>Transitioning from school to the real world is really weird. I&#x27;ve done it 4 separate times before graduation (internships and co-ops) and I&#x27;ve always loved work way more than school. We all have high hopes for graduation and when we don&#x27;t get what we want, we can dwell on it for some time. Your best bet is to take things slow and take action on ideas when they come to you in your free time. Work on open source projects or make something for yourself.

If SJ were presenting, he would have focused 10 minutes on how this device was the best and most precise thing at telling time. He would have shown how the hardware surpassed anything a mechanical watch would have ever done and it would be the time/watch nerds dream device.<p>With all the compromises in size and battery life, this is what you would gain in return for it. Instead, it was sold as a &quot;me too&quot;, complementary device, just with Apple magic thrown in there.<p>So now in the end, I don&#x27;t need a mini-iphone on my wrist or do I want one. I can just as easily pull the phone out of my pocket as it takes the same amount of time.<p>Such a shame really, because it&#x27;s obvious that Apple had their brightest engineers work long hours on it.",1410290401
