8327776,comment,8324339,8324642,1,0,thegeomaster,,,"This is exactly my train of thought. But a lot of these developers don&#x27;t really mind not getting the press---these jobs do pay really well. As far as I know, for instance, C++ game engine developers or people who write powerful, scalable web servers for in-house use make quite a lot of money nowadays. It&#x27;s a completely different life than the engineers working in risky, fragile startups in return for a high possible payout, but who has it better here is debatable... and a matter of personal opinion, I guess.<p>Still, writing about Dropbox or Facebook or Stripe or whatever is now hot is way more interesting for the journalists. However, there&#x27;s no doubt that the guy who wrote nginx or the Unity team (the game engine, not the Ubuntu GUI) made a hell of an impact on the industry, too. It&#x27;s just that it takes more technical expertise to actually appreciate what these guys have done. That&#x27;s the reason why most of the people know Steve Wozniak (if at all) as &quot;that guy who worked for Jobs.&quot; Not that Facebook or Dropbox or Stripe or Jobs don&#x27;t deserve the praise, it&#x27;s just that they&#x27;ve built their empires on technology that also does.",1410911997

8327770,comment,8326883,8327215,11,0,vidarh,,,"It&#x27;s fascinating that this was something new on the PC that late.<p>This is roughly how most scrolling on the C64 happens (though it works by <i>reducing</i> the visible display by 8 hires pixels on either side of the screen, and scrolling at most 8 hires pixels before you need to shift &quot;tiles&quot; / characters). I&#x27;m not sure it was new with the C64 either. While most C64 games used sprites for the movable objects, there are absolutely exceptions that tracked damage.<p>On the Amiga, however, the method described is basically pretty much how you&#x27;re expected to do scrolling from the outset(it has much more extensive support for it than EGA did). AmigaOS even came with built in support for managing damage lists for such objects (&quot;bobs&quot; for &quot;blittable objects&quot;) and double buffering from 1985, though most games would have used their own code for it.<p>For these systems redrawing the whole screen was simply never seen as viable, or worthwhile. The Amiga hardware support for doing this kind of scrolling + the use of the blitter for moving game objects and replacing damaged sections made this method the obvious choice.<p>Even double-buffering was sometimes seen as too wasteful, with a solution being to sort damage lists and tie updates to the raster interrupt to update the screen before the raster beam reached it.",1410911942

8327694,comment,8320968,8322439,0,0,pbsd,,,"My comment appears to have been more polarizing than I ever expected. Let me clear some things up.<p>In your unique_ptr example, you&#x27;re right: the reference doesn&#x27;t outlast its owner, but it becomes a dangerous zombie after getting its guts removed. It is worth mentioning that the behavior may or may not be UB depending on how `foo` takes its parameters: std::move is really just a cast.<p>Maybe interest is the wrong word to use; many functional languages have generated a lot of interest, but this interest has historically not translated into actual mass usage. Instead, popular languages have adopted certain functional features over time (lambdas, comprehensions, type classes, etc), but have remained fundamentally Algolian for the most part. Rust seems to go in the opposite direction: start with ML (or something ML-like, anyway), and strip it down until it fits into the C++ space.<p>I am definitely interested in C++ replacements, to be clear. I have explored things that stray from it much more than Rust, such as Haskell and ATS, but I went into those fully expecting to see something different. But look at documents such as [1], and tell me that it doesn&#x27;t create the <i>expectation</i> that Rust is trying to fit C++&#x27;s shoes a little too tightly. Additionally, trawling through mailing list discussions, familiarity with C-like languages seems to have been a design principle since the start (see for example the <> vs [] for generics debate).<p>Finally, I wasn&#x27;t (and am not) passing judgment on Rust for being what it is. I was conveying my experience from being excited about it, to being less excited about it after actually learning it. I don&#x27;t expect a productive discussion to come out of it; I&#x27;ve also seen how defensive the Rust community can be [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Rust-for-CXX-programmers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/wiki/Rust-for-CXX-programm...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://pay.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2bbeqe/it_started_out_with_great_enthusiasm_but_ended_up/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pay.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/2bbeqe/it_started_out...</a>",1410910516

Insofar as there is a disincentive to distribute retained earnings, its because long-term capital gains are taxed as capital gains, but dividends are taxed both as corporate income and (currently, usually) as long-term capital gains to the recipient.<p>Simply allowing expensing of distributions would equalize the tax treatment and eliminate the bias in favor of retained earnings, no change in the basic basis of the rest of the tax system is necessary to that purpose.<p>Sure, eliminating the taxation of income (including corporate income and capital gains) entirely would <i>also</i> eliminate that bias, but its massive overkill if that&#x27;s your only concern.",1410910512

That increase equates to &quot;zero selective pressure&quot;: basically anybody could breed successfully, and they did (including my ancestors, some of whom occupied the more stagnant and brackish depths of the gene pool...)<p>So up until 1750 or so intelligence was being selected for, generation after generation. After that time, there was no pressure and the many small effects that this article documents as underlying the heritability of intelligence (with no single gene showing as much as a 1% effect on the overall outcome) would happily carry us all on a random walk across the landscape, creating engineers in some parts and political partisans in others.<p>This realization makes particularly funny the various organizations that have at times promoted Nobelists etc as pinnacles of intelligence (William Shockly, inventor of the transistor, was heavily involved in this kind of thing). Nobelists are certainly bright, but it seems more likely you&#x27;d find the most intelligent people amongst still-extant stone age tribes, whose pre-industrial life-style would still subject them to selective pressures long released in the more-developed world.",1410910246

We should be careful not to anachronistically apply meritocratic assumptions about intelligence to other eras where raw intelligence and mental flexibility was less important than domain knowledge and practiced skill.

I&#x27;ve seen research saying social mobility has decreased recently (it didn&#x27;t say about over 100 years) and is lower than in Europe, for example. Also, at least some research says that access to higher education depends significantly on the wealth of your parents; elite universities (and others) have problems attracting and graduating poor, smart students.<p>2) The value of specific cognitive skills varies over time. If 100 years ago, you had great ability to translate problems into efficient data structures and logic, I&#x27;m not sure how much economic value you would have. 50 years from now, I&#x27;m not sure how many humans will be writing code.<p>3) There is far more to capability than intelligence.
