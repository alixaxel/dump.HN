For example you could draw your own glyphs on a HTML canvas element. That would still be &quot;the open web&quot; in some literal sense, but it&#x27;s less of a web app in that case and more of a JavaScript app that can run in the browser.<p>You&#x27;re right that using the browser as the runtime is a key requirement for an open web app, but I would add a bunch more criteria:<p>- every user-relevant resource has a URL.<p>- content is rendered with the semantic tags HTML provides when possible<p>- the app is performant in common browsers<p>- you use HTML and CSS in a way that things degrade gracefully on older browsers<p>- you use standard interactions (hyperlinks, forms) wherever possible and implement your own widgets only when necessary.<p>By these criteria many pure HTML apps are not good open web apps. The old practice of rendering text in GIFs to get typefaces and anti-aliasing was a step away from &quot;the open web&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s strictly a technical line people are talking about. It&#x27;s a set of conventions that let us write code that is cross platform and gets many benefits for free (sharability, printability, responsive design, etc)",1410486998
8306242,story,,,1,5,StudlyCaps,"What I saw on 9/11. This is not a joke",,"On the morning of 9/11 I was heading to work at an office on 11th avenue in West Chelsea.  I exited the 23rd ST C train station at about 9:00 AM. I immediately heard the incredibly loud sound of a jet plane directly overhead. This was not the sound of a jet plane passing overhead at cruising altitude. This was the sound you hear when driving  into an airport terminal with planes taking off and landing right above your car. I turned and saw a twin-engine jet plane flying south over 8th avenue. It was so low that it was practically buzzing the two-story buildings on the east side of the block. The plane appeared to be descending slowly and smoothly. The first thought that went trough my mind was that it was going to land in the middle of the street. My next thought was &quot;what the hell kind of plane is this?&quot;It was roughly the same size and shape as a 747 but there were no windows along the fuselage. It was painted flat gray like a battle ship. There were no logos, no stripe across the fuselage, no writing, no bright splash of color on the tail. Just flat gray. The only discernible marking was a light blue &quot;bulls eye&quot; nose on the nose of the cockpit. When the plane flew beyond my field of vision  I wanted to stick around  but I was late for a staff meeting. I boarded the M23 bus hoping that it might be a few minutes faster than walking. A few minutes later I heard a smashing sound so loud that it nearly burst my ear drums. My brain knew it was the plane but my heart wanted to believe otherwise. I knew my worst fears were confirmed when I heard the bus driver&#x27;s CB radio. The dispatcher was instructing the drivers to suspend service after dropping off their passengers. The voice on the CB tried to assure the drivers who were downtown. &quot;we&#x27;ll get you out of there as soon as possible!&quot; As I exited the bus at the last stop the Driver said &quot;Folks be careful, they just bombed the World Trade Center!&quot; Here&#x27;s my question, did you see what I saw? Can you explain what I saw?",1410486904

8306231,comment,8305486,8306042,13,0,mjn,,,"There&#x27;s a fairly large part of the ex-Prolog community that decided to go all-in on the declarative part, partly in reaction to that, and partly in reaction to other warts in Prolog&#x27;s semantics, like the fact that statement order is significant. There was a period when logic-programming theorists were trying to come up with what Prolog&#x27;s semantics would be, if you assumed it was possible to give it a vaguely logic-style semantics versus defining its semantics as &quot;whatever SLDNF gives you&quot;. One of the proposals that came out that was the &quot;stable model semantics&quot;. And that gave rise to a purely declarative logic-programming paradigm, answer-set programming. That has then turned out to mesh well with modern developments in SAT/SMT/etc. solver-style systems, instead of Prolog&#x27;s more classic backtracking search, so sits at some kind of intermediate space where it&#x27;s about equally influenced by the logic-programming heritage and the &quot;solver&quot; heritage.<p>A well-maintained / open-source implementation: <a href=""http://potassco.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://potassco.sourceforge.net</a><p>An introductory paper: <a href=""http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-270.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AAAI/2008/AAAI08-270.pdf</a>",1410486738

8306229,comment,8304688,8305456,6,0,cf,,,"One of the authors here. In terms of expressiveness, Hakaru is much more in the mold of something like Church, Venture, or Anglican where we can more easily express nonparametric models. This means in the context of the model, once a random variable is generated from a prior distribution, it might be used as an ordinary Haskell value and be directly used to in the control-flow. When that happens you can write models where the number of parameters changes based on values of parameters generated earlier in the model. As a concrete example, imagine a Bayesian Neural Network where there was a prior on how many layers are in the neural network.<p>This is in contrast to something like PyMC where random variables are very much special objects that interacted with, and making nonparametric models is trickier.<p>Like PyMC, Figaro, Infer.NET and Factorie but unlike OpenBUGS this is a library so it is easier to use a larger prediction application. We don&#x27;t support some of the optimizations that OpenBUGS can do when presented with a model.<p>As another note, this is a fairly new piece of code. Unlike PyMC, BLOG, Stan, and other probabilistic programming systems we only support Importance Sampling and a fairly naive version of Metropolis Hastings. This is in contrast to many of the existing solutions where you can do things like Particle MCMC and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We do intend to eventually support these inference techniques.",1410486632

When the US Government was forcing telecom by telecom to install taps into their business&#x27;s core routing hubs  Joseph Nacchio, the CEO at the time, dug his heels in demanding legal avenues to avoid turning his back on QWest&#x27;s customers. The US threatened to pull out large contracts that made up a large part of QWest&#x27;s business.<p>Furthermore, having been served a National Security Letter, Nacchio was not able to speak to his company or shareholders about the situation.<p>Nacchio continued to insist on legal avenues and Uncle Sam did exactly what it threatened. Nacchio warned major stakeholders that all of the major QWest contracts were about to go belly up.<p>The US government threw Nacchio in prison for insider trading.<p>Oh and then QWest went bankrupt and was bought by competitor CenturyLink (who presumably had fewer difficulties complying).<p>Sometimes the market has more than one invisible hand.<p>Edit: A good point by a fellow commentor - no independent investigation has been performed into the QWest story.

Seems like there&#x27;s some room for optimization</i><p>It does not suggest there is a possible optimization. cp needs to store the pointer <i>and</i> the path itself in memory, so it is more than 8 bytes. ~39 bytes/file means the average path length was 15 bytes (8-byte source device + 8-byte source inode + 8-byte pointer + ~15-byte path = ~39 bytes). I guess one theoretical optimization would be to add to Linux a system call to open a file by device+inode number. So the pointer+path would be replaced by a fixed 8-byte dest device + 8-byte dest inode (so 32 bytes/file). Or since the destination is only one filesystem in this case, you would just need 8-byte source device + 8-byte source inode + 8-byte dest inode (24 bytes/file). In this latter case, the 17 GB hash table would have shrunk to 10 GB, which could have help completely avoid the swap in the OP&#x27;s case.<p>Edit: correct, I do not account for unused space in the hash table, for simplicity. So read all my numbers assuming a ±10-30% range. However it seems that the OP who quoted 432e6 files meant 432e6 file <i>names</i>, not <i>inodes</i>. So if the average inode had, say, 4.3 hardlinks (IOW 4.3 names), it means the 17GB hashtable only had 100e6 files in it, so 170 bytes/file, so 170-8-8-8 = 146-byte pathnames on average (±10-30%), with sounds more reasonable.",1410483924
