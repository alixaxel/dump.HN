The answer is simple: &quot;change the system.&quot;<p>There are enough parameters in &quot;the system&quot; that we should be able to change almost any single one of them and get some improvement in employment numbers. Change wages, change education levels, change the scale of industrialization, change the number of humans working, change laws surrounding mergers/acquisitions, etc.<p>The real struggle here is getting anyone to do any of these things consistently, and then measuring the results.",1411901896

That&#x27;s why, for example, we explicitly guard against LD_PRELOAD&#x27;ing a shared library into a suid-binary... But it was common knowledge, that this selection of dangerous/benign variables can be made based on the NAME of the variable, NOT the CONTENT. And bash basically calls eval(name+&#x27; &#x27;+env[name]) for every variable containing the magic substring.<p>Imagine any of your other favourite script languages scanning random places for &quot;things that look as if they could be imported/included/executed&quot;... and tell me that this is a smart thing to do.<p>The second mistake was to not just create a function-definition inside the currently running program, but to actually eval the complete content of the variable. If bash would just postpone the evaluation of the function to the point in time where it&#x27;s actually called, no one would be bothered, because the script would have to be tricked into executing a command called &quot;RECIPIENT&quot; (or DHCP_OPTION_1234, or COOKIE, ...).",1411901883

For example Berlin used to have one of the largest tram line systems, that also had freight trams. Early industrial cities in general tend to have a much better transportation system until today. As long as the lower classes were not able to buy a car, it was actually in the interest of industrialists to pressure for investments in public infrastructure, so their workers had an efficient commute.<p>Now that the car industry plays a less significant role in some of the (post) industrial countries maybe there is hope to boost other forms of transportation.",1411901169

I decided against going with the first one (multiple reasons).<p>The 2nd one is http://www.axelspringerplugandplay.com/ .  Axel Springer is this huge publishing house (the largest in Europe), they have numerous big newspapers (Bild, for example). I&#x27;d spend 3 months in Berlin working in their office along with other startups. 25k EUR for 5% equity. Demo day. They recruited in Berlin and Krakow (application -> short pitching & Q&A), so I guess most of the participants will speak German. They started a year ago.<p>The third is http://startupsauna.com/ . Their recruitment process was much cooler, it involved a few hours of 1 on 1 coaching sessions with 6 mentors. It&#x27;s 1 month, more business oriented (no time to work on a product) and no money/equity involved (they&#x27;re a non-profit). They said there&#x27;s a 10k EUR convertible note along with a 30k grant from Finnish govt. The program ends with a demo day they organise at the Slush conf. They started in 2012.<p>Both offer mentoring, workshops, all the good stuff. Same with a trip to the Valley for the most promising alumni.<p>My story: mobile app(s), quite a bit of traction (over 1M downloads), pretty solid plans for rapid and rather inexpensive growth. Enough revenue to support my family, but at least a few months away from that growth. Also need 2-3 people for that (have specific people in mind, Axel Springer&#x27;s money would make it possible).<p>This is all I know. I don&#x27;t have any tools at my disposal to evaluate those two programs. I can&#x27;t compare mentors, alumni or investor pitching potential.
