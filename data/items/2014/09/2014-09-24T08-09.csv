QC for a film is complex, and it has to be done because when someone watches something on Netflix they expect a minimum amount of technical quality even if the creativity is entirely absent.<p>I mean stuff like no messed up video frames, audio glitches, consistent volume levels and so on - it can be the worst film in the world but people still expect it play back properly and will blame Netflix if it does not, just as they would blame Netflix for an improperly encoded DVD that failed to play back.<p>Everything that gets uploaded by Netflix has to be passed by a broadcast engineer first, and while they are not paid massive amounts of money they are still paid and films have to be watched, QCed and cataloged in real time. No matter how crap it is, any film that&#x27;s available for streaming on Netflix/Amazon has taken at least half a day of skilled labor.<p>It would be nice to think that if something gets as far as being pressed onto DVD it would meet minimum standards of technical quality but the reality is sadly different. You would not <i>believe</i> the appalling quality of the stuff that people try to sell.",1411549176

Even in many cases in enterprise settings.<p>We have some cheapish SSD&#x27;s in use for some of our high traffic database servers. We lost some drives that failed catastrophically, and the company we bought it from &quot;suggested&quot; we might have worn them out and maybe we didn&#x27;t have a reason to RMA them, and perhaps we just ought to buy more expensive enterprise models next time.<p>So we checked the SMART data, and after a year of what to us is heavy 24/7 use with a large percentage of writes, we&#x27;d gone through less than 10% of the P/E cycles.<p>(We did our RMA, and it was very clear that this was a problem with the model/batch - all the failed drives were OCZ Vertex drives from when their failure rate shot through the roof before the bankruptcy)<p>All our other SSD&#x27;s are chugging along nicely; the oldest have suffered through 3-4 years of heavy database traffic. I am just waiting for the oldest ones to start failing.<p>At that rate it doesn&#x27;t matter if they won&#x27;t survive as long as SLC anyway: We&#x27;ll end up replacing them with faster, higher capacity newer models soon anyway - we usually do on a 3-5 year cycle depending on hardware and needs -, because it&#x27;s more cost-effective for us to upgrade regularly to increase our hosting density as it helps us avoid taking more rack space, and colocation space/power/cooling costs us more than the amortised cost of the hardware.<p>The consumer market is similar: Most people don&#x27;t ever buy replacements for failed drives - they buy a newer computer.",1411546984
