This data doesn&#x27;t necessarily require multimedia, sometimes its all about access to basic information like dates for demonstrations, or other political topics and things like that. This could be really hand for hundreds of thousands of people who are just not informed and kept silent by their governments. Think about that when implementing. There is a not-so-small audience out there.<p>Do not get discouraged by all those people who are telling you that its too expensive. Those guys are sitting in behind a high-speed access and don&#x27;t seem to look beyond the horizon, that sometimes its not about getting 2GB across with SMS (really? ... I mean... REALLY?!), its about getting basic access to information. Not every country is as awesome as the US or Europe in this world. Not everyone is free. And not everyone uses the internet the way we seem to got used to it.<p>Keep up the great work, its an awesome idea.

The original Droid (Milestone outside the US) through the Droid 4 were all OMAP (first OMAP3, then OMAP4) and I believe also used TI WiFi/Bluetooth.<p>The last &quot;flagship&quot; Android phone to use OMAP was the Galaxy Nexus, which had Android updates stop with 4.3. It&#x27;s been rumored this was because TI had stopped maintaining up-to-date kernels/drivers for use with Android.<p>This would make it a bigger chore to bring-up the current version of Android than it would be on a current Snapdragon.\nAlso, the OMAP3630 is just an old chip: 45nm vs. 28nm used by the other (Snapdragon 400) Android Wear watches.<p>If I had to guess: Motorola had a bunch of OMAP3630s still left in stock (and was quoted a very good price by TI for more)",1410501409

If they&#x27;d only exposed the processors directly and worked to unify behind a common compiler frontend... Imagine a world where a good GPGPU language was a standard GCC/LLVM frontend and all the GPU vendors worked in harmony to improve their back-ends in the upstream compiler. This would enable development of new cross-vendor GPU languages to compete with the ailing OpenCL.<p>(This is what Apple has done with Metal Shading Language btw, minus the open source part. And what Intel&#x27;s Larrabee would have enabled.)<p>Even if you disregard the licensing, the union of NV + AMD + Intel capabilities (software stacks included) is so weak that it almost never worth the effort. The comically bad software from AMD and lack of hardware oomph from Intel means the only option is to require NVidia and build on their software support. This is passable for a narrow sector of activities that can tolerate vendor lock-in (Cuda), like short lived HPC projects.<p>All this has resulted in lack of open GPU programming languages. OpenCL is better than nothing, but even if the implementations were of usable quality, it&#x27;s not a good compiler target for higher level languages and it&#x27;s not a good language to write by hand.<p>The situation pretty much guarantees GPU computing stays in the fringes for the foreseeable future.",1410500756

8306717,comment,8303785,8306165,1,0,eslaught,,,"Sure, nothing stops a website (or app) from going to Google to ask for your contacts. This is the classic &quot;invite your contacts&quot; strategy that Facebook, LinkedIn, etc. have employed since the beginning. But granting that access is almost never mandatory with such services. Why? Because people just wouldn&#x27;t sign up. It&#x27;s not even necessarily a question of people not trusting the service, because the UX hurdle of forcing the user to enter yet-one-more-password is enough to hurt conversion rates.<p>On Android, this is not the case; if you use the Facebook or LinkedIn apps, you <i>will</i> be forced to give up access to your contacts (unless you root your device). The reasons for this are twofold. First, Android permissions are all-or-nothing, which means that apps have to over-approximate their required permissions. Second, because granting access is so easy (no UX hurdle to speak of), there&#x27;s really no downside to doing so (which is to say, conversion rates will not decrease substantially).<p>The issue of how the device gets access to the data (e.g. whether contacts are cached locally or are purely remote) is really not the issue. You could easily implement the Android API with no local caching of data, and aside from the performance hit the behavior would be identical.<p>I could certainly imagine a version of ChromeOS which supports Android apps without the Android permission model, essentially by returning empty data sets whenever the app asks. This would be compatible with ChromeOS&#x27;s current security policies, and would protect user privacy. But it would be <i>so easy</i> for Google to break that line in order to promote &quot;better UX&quot; for apps in the style of Android, that I can&#x27;t honestly convince myself that they&#x27;ll never go down that road.

8306688,comment,8303422,8305153,2,0,djokkataja,,,"I think a lot of it boils down to what the evolutionary pressures (defn: [1]) on another planet might look like. If we discover life on another planet, it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if some of the organisms we find resemble organisms in some branches of the &quot;tree of life&quot; on Earth, but I think it would be unlikely that there would be so many similar evolutionary pressures that we would see something particularly similar to ourselves.<p>For example, life has been around for at least 3.5 billion years on this planet[2]. At this point in time, there is no evidence that any other species on this planet has ever had a technological civilization that would be of particular interest to us in the way that is often envisioned for hypothetical alien visitors. This isn&#x27;t for lack of different species[3] or for insufficient genomic complexity[4] in other species. In other words, there&#x27;s nothing about the human genome that represents a &quot;pinnacle&quot; of evolution, as much as we tend to hold ourselves in pretty high regard among other species.<p>As another example, let&#x27;s walk the tree of life (<a href=""http://tolweb.org/Life_on_Earth/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tolweb.org/Life_on_Earth/1</a>) to get a ballpark idea of how many different features we run into before encountering homo sapiens:<p>1.

Primates <a href=""http://tolweb.org/Primates/15963"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tolweb.org/Primates/15963</a><p>There are several more branches before getting to homo sapiens.<p>I think the big remaining questions are:<p>1. What features of an organism are necessary for that species to develop a technological spacefaring civilization?<p>2. Are evolutionary pressures that support the development of those features likely to appear eventually on life-bearing planets similar to Earth? (I think this assumes that abiogenesis on other planets would be likely to produce simple cellular structures with similar capacities for evolution.)<p>3. Are we in a simulation created by another species in a &quot;real&quot; universe to answer similar questions? :)<p>I&#x27;d guess...<p>1. Limbs (and the supporting underlying physical structures) with significant capacity for manipulating objects, terrestrial-dwelling (as opposed to living in the sea), a advanced neocortex, and way too much free time, along with very difficult-to-impress mating prospects.<p>2. Depends on how similar to earth (a waterworld would be unlikely to have any species developing advanced technology, I think... maybe I&#x27;m not being imaginative enough). Also depends on how many of the evolutionary pressures that got us to this point were more or less inevitable as opposed to random. It seems that even if it&#x27;s relatively likely that a species similar to humans will evolve on planets similar to Earth, there are still numerous additional hurdles in the development of different kinds of societies that could make or break the whole spacefaring thing. Even now, humans are not a spacefaring species, and the odds that we nuke ourselves out of existence or create a genetically engineered superbug that wipes us all out are relatively high considering we have absolutely no backup plan as a species for either of those events (or any number of other catastrophic global events). So maybe my answer to #1 is insufficient because we&#x27;re not really a spacefaring species yet.<p>3. If they have that kind of computing power, I would&#x27;ve expected something more interesting. Maybe they&#x27;re trying to predict the odds of encountering other species like themselves during a galactic collision? :) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_collision"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda%E2%80%93Milky_Way_co...</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_pressure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_pressure</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis</a><p>[3]: There are approximately 10 million species currently alive on Earth (more or less a minimum bound, the actual number may be much higher). <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/science/30species.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/science/30species.html?_r=...</a>\nAt least 99% of all species to have ever lived are extinct now: <a href=""http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9h.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/9h.html</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome#Genome_size"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome#Genome_size</a>",1410499062

But as the novelty of these products wear off (as they should) Apple still strives to distinguish itself (and continue to charge its premiums) by designing superior hardware. The hardware market is somewhat saturated, but since the tech is always improving, planned obsolescence means we get to take advantage of superior tech and better products every few years.<p>The real growth market is the cloud and internet-of-things, and I think the author got it right by imagining Jobs describing the watch as a product for the &quot;personal universe&quot;. Tethering to an iPhone is the first step to tethering to the Cloud. Apple is still trying to figure out the cloud, and they keep stumbling, and the celebrity leak (of which nothing was said to a room full of celebrities), and the live stream screw up are the latest examples. Also, egregiously, their indifference to producing a responsive website. They&#x27;re still a hardware company, and the hardware, combined with their tightly controlled OS X / Unix based software, provide a solid platform for the design of superior software, by others.<p>The first iPhone was severely limited and it didn&#x27;t become the democratized smartphone until after the App Store and the 3G, that is to say, after they crowdsourced software development. The watch seems like the iPhone 2G and the Nano watch hack as revised by Ive. I don&#x27;t want this version, but I&#x27;ll probably want the one after the next, when its twice as thin, and Ive makes another pompous video extolling its bullshit (I can&#x27;t have been the only one rolling my eyes at the &quot;horological experts&quot; and the &quot;conferring on how different cultures care about time&quot; ... the clock was perfected years ago).<p>The thing about Apple is that they keep making the Modernist Future come true - handheld communicators, tablets, and now walkie-talkie watches. Tim Cook is proud of the fact that they pulled off the Dick Tracy finally, and who cares whatever Samsung did a year ago. What they really need to pull off next are the holograms.<p>It just seems to me as well that to everything there is a season, and Apple has had a glorious turn of the century. It integrated itself with youth culture, but do you think the kids of the 2030s will still crowd Apple retail stores, presuming they still exist? Or will they see the brand as that of their parents, and thus lame.<p>My greater point though is that Jobs is dead and let him rest in peace, and let Apple grow beyond Jobs, and don&#x27;t worry if one day in about twenty years you hear some kid say Apple is lame. Apple did that to Sony, and presumably some startup out there now, or about to be created, might do that to Apple.",1410498654
