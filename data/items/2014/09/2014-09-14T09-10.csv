The nonexistence of a personal interventionist god (Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Alpha&quot;) is a couple of lines and Occam&#x27;s razor; the nonexistence of a universe-creating god (Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Omega&quot;) doesn&#x27;t even need the couple of lines.<p>The rationale usually given for religion these days is as a source of moral guidance; the bible may not be literally true, but it&#x27;s full of wisdom you can apply to your daily life. The Church isn&#x27;t really about preparing for the second coming of Jesus, but it helps bind the community together; it provides a place you can go for moral advice, a way to direct charitable efforts, shared rituals that help people know each other and so on.<p>But those matters are things you can judge through observation. If I know christians and atheists, and I observe that the atheists are living more moral lives than the christians, then even on the kind of grounds I&#x27;ve described above, I absolutely should choose to be atheist.",1410687911

All data about you belongs to you, no matter who collected it why and how.<p>If you don&#x27;t own your data, you don&#x27;t have any privacy.<p>Yes, that is very hard to properly regulate, leaves a lot of fair use grey areas and with the rapid pace of technologies leads to hastily created regulation like the &quot;cookie-law&quot; or the right-to-be-forgotten. (Although in both cases the industry deliberately made a circus of the implementation, and especially the latter is now backfiring hard on Google.)<p>But the bottom line is, if the law doesn&#x27;t recognize your fundamental ownership of your data, you have no privacy and you never will, no matter what other forms of legislation and self-regulation get implemented in the areas of collecting and using that data.<p>The US is one of the few Western democracies that doesn&#x27;t recognize this fundamental aspect of privacy, and in the information age, that makes any form of privacy regulation a complete joke.<p>Step one should be to put the individual in control of their data at any time. If people are not informed about what happens to their data <i>if and when it happens</i> and are not in a position to stop it, they&#x27;ve already lost their privacy.<p>Privacy should not be a faux &quot;right&quot; like copyright, something you can just sign away for someone else to exploit.

I am afraid that this is at variance to how the world works generally and how acquisitions of small websites work specifically.<p>People pay for their future revenues, not your sunk costs.  In the world of small website acquisitions, you&#x27;ll be valued at something like 1X your previously proven annual revenue, not at a linear projection from what spike day looked like.  If that number is -- let me pick a representative example -- $100, then you have a $100 site, not a $60,000 site, even if $60k is a reasonable approximation of the cost of duplicating it using market labor.<p>Also, as someone who also has struggled / struggles with depression: it is much much better for yourself and the world on net for you to just say &quot;I am under stress and cannot email today, therefore, I will not email today.&quot; than for you to be adversely affected trying to get people replies to their questions about a browser game.  Some people may be discomfit by this.  That&#x27;s fine.  There is an entire Internet full of browser games.  There is only one you.  Do whatever you need to to not have this adversely effect you and your loved ones.<p>Congratulations on shipping, by the way.  Very few people can do it.  You demonstrably can.  That&#x27;s awesome.
