8344631,comment,8344319,8344514,1,0,electromagnetic,,,"I assume their rationale is that if X% (say 5%) are the ones who stay up late into the early hours for their scheming they are less likely to be noticed for what they do. However being inactive when the other Y% (95%) are active isn&#x27;t as risky as anyone plotting against you is easily going to be witnessed.<p>There&#x27;s a problem with this theory though. A lot of the witch trials contained accusations about late night activities, which given that a lot of it was obviously fraudulent (IIRC the last witch trial in Sweden[?] ended with the execution of several of the accusers after one confessed after the execution and the flogging of the witnesses for perjury) it would be arguable that we actively targeted those who were &#x27;night time chronotypes&#x27;.<p>One could equally argue it wasn&#x27;t that narcissist and psychopaths got ahead by being active late at night, but that they were the ones who were best able to survive being active late at night. Narcissists are typically well aware of what those around them think of them - they&#x27;re charming but distant. Psychopaths are not likely people you&#x27;d want to openly confront with weak accusations, and Machiavellians are not people you wanted to openly accuse! There&#x27;s quite a few witch trial stories where the accusers end up being punished, which to me sounds exactly like the work of a Machiavellian.<p>Survival of the fittest works two ways. One is &quot;out performing&quot; and the other is &quot;out surviving&quot;. Why do we still have alligators, crocodiles? They certainly don&#x27;t out perform mammals, neither do snakes or other reptiles. They all live on the fringe and &quot;out survive&quot; the mammals. Reptiles excel at surviving - low metabolism and low water needs means infrequent hunting and infrequent drinking, which are two things mammals can&#x27;t survive without.<p>The Dark Triad personalities could easily be the reptiles of the personality world. They don&#x27;t thrive, they just out survive.",1411225107
