8329301,comment,8328646,8328646,2,0,bsaul,,,"This blog completely misses the mark.<p>First, android has had a culture of &quot;free, ad-sponsored&quot; applications, whereas iOS apps have always been about paying for the stuff (not surprising if you understand a bit of apple and google businesses).<p>As a consequence (or because of the fact) iOS users are more likely to spend money than android users. This means that if you&#x27;re doing a mobile shopping app, you expect iOS users to be much more likely to buy your products. \nSo it&#x27;s not just about market share, it&#x27;s about market share times purchasing power.<p>That&#x27;s for the market, now on the other end, about developers, saying &quot;android&quot; has a large market share, is not relevant. You want to speak about android market share per OS/api version. I did start developing on android, but the minute you click on the &quot;create new project&quot; you need to ask yourself how many android users you want to ignore (in double digit percentages). If you want to have the maximum market share you need to develop with 3 years old apis, and you&#x27;ll probably frustrate users that have brand new devices. In my experience, that&#x27;s where project owner decide to postpone the decision to start the android version of their product.<p>Then, if you make it up to this point, you need to decide what screen size you want to support and how many different version of your UI you will need to design. Note that you still haven&#x27;t started a single line of code yet !<p>Finally, you start coding and realize the toolchain sucks pretty much. Xcode is obviously much better than anything on the market and i won&#x27;t even start talking about the simulator (which <i>is</i> important as soon as you need to test on different screen sizes).<p>All in all, most of the time android feels like developing for a second grade market, having second grade devices, with second grade tools, on 3 years old apis. No wonder developers don&#x27;t rush for it..",1410947843

But for different reasons.<p>The Android documentation is spectacularly good, IMO, though admittedly it is more reference focused than tutorial focused (which works for me, YMMV).  Eclipse sucks but Android Studio is pretty nice, and in either case you don&#x27;t need to use an IDE if you don&#x27;t want to.  I use Sublime Text 2 and command-line builds most of the time, using Android Studio only when I want to do on-device visual debugging.<p>The Java thing is a bit more true, the language can feel somewhat painful at times, especially since it is frozen in time at Java 6 for the most part, with a few little bits of Java 7 thrown in at random with little to no clear guidance from Google on where it is headed post-Oracle lawsuit.<p>Also there are places where the OS APIs are a bit too Java-esque in terms of being overly abstracted without a compelling reason why.  Also the whole activity/fragment lifecycle and the way services work is a bit weird at first for people used to writing traditional apps, but any competent developer will learn to live with it pretty quickly.  It still tends to be a sticking issue anyway because of the fact that a lot of designers (who are mostly iOS-centric, as the original article alludes to) don&#x27;t really &quot;get it&quot; and thus design in ways that don&#x27;t fit the OS app lifecycle (and don&#x27;t get me started on their &quot;pixel perfect&quot; designs).<p>All that aside I had no idea Android Developers were seen as hard to find.

I tried for a while but the platform we had built did not really lend itself to interaction. Many people used it as a news feed for European startups and tech news rather than a place to interact. The site never gathered critical mass to have enough submitters and commenters to keep things moving.<p>3. It was our first community project and we were inexperienced.

8329250,comment,8327676,8329092,3,0,dfox,,,"It is slightly more complex than that. EMV is designed as to allow configurable methods of card holder verification and to be backward compatible with back-end systems. This means that PIN is not required to unlock card and even not mandatory for successful transaction. This is configurable and whether PIN is actually required depends on both card&#x27;s and terminal&#x27;s configuration and current state, this allows for things like small payments without PIN (which is how NFC cards usually work).<p>Because of backward compatibility, the transaction signature generated by the card has to fit into 8 BCD digits, which essentially precludes use of any kind of public key cryptography. Actual algorithm for how signatures are generated and verified is issuer defined and only card issuer can actually verify signatures (terminal just blindly trusts whatever was returned by card).<p>Public key cryptography (ie. RSA) is used in EMV to verify that card was really issued by claimed issuer (card contains data structure that is signed by issuer&#x27;s key) and to optionally encrypt PIN sent to card for offline verification (PIN is somehow regarded as super-sensitive by banking industry)<p>One can certainly imagine better design than EMV (eg. without various implicit trust relationships), but in all, it is pretty reasonable mechanism nonetheless.",1410946694

8329177,comment,8324890,8324890,1,0,anotherevan,,,"I’ll admit I’ve always passionately disliked Javascript. I also have a strong preference for statically typed languages over dynamic, but always thought Javascript was the most unlikeable of the lot. Perhaps it is that I initially learnt it by osmosis, trying to get things working under both Netscape and early Internet Explorer browsers at the same time. Worrying if I put my curly brace on the same line or the following line, or if I forgot a semi-colon at some obscure, critical location.<p>But I’ve always been hesitant of dynamic languages in general, preferring statically typed for any codebase of significant size. The last decade has been a bit discouraging for me in this regard. First everybody was loving Ruby, then seemed that Python has overtook it in attention. And then Node.js came along and I really felt like Bromden with a pillow, looking for a way to smother the insanity.<p>(As an aside, I do quite like Ruby as a language, and writing Coffeescript - the wonderful lipstick for the pig that is javascript - has given me an appreciation for the indentation feature a’la Python.)<p>The number one problem to my mind with using dynamic languages for a large codebase is maintainability. Refactoring a compiled, statically typed language is so much easier. There is so many potential errors that the act of compiling and type checking eliminate for you that you don’t get with dynamic languages. The focus on huge amounts of unit tests always seemed like compensation for this. And refactoring code is so much easier. Add another parameter to a function, try and compile and you find all the places in the code you need to fix. Maintaining a sizeable amount of code, or code you haven’t looked at for a while is so much easier.<p>And I get the feeling the pendulum of opinion is starting to swing back in my direction. Running stuff in a web-browser is now a serious concern, and good hackers are working on ways to portably do good programming in anything but Javascript. From asm.js to Dart to PureScript and others.<p>Newer languages like Go and Rust are taking the nice features many have lauded in the last decade as the advantages of dynamic languages. Things like good package management, less boilerplate and such, and baking them into static languages. So my outlook is getting rosier.",1410944628

8329175,comment,8324047,8325405,1,0,netcan,,,">>the monetary valuation is supposed to reflect the human valuation<p>I think this is a misunderstood or over-extrapolated assumption from liberal economics. Especially with the economics of free or very cheap services, I think revenue can be far more disconnected from total &quot;utility&quot; of a business. Massive online services generate a lot of uncultured utility and it&#x27;s not unreasonable (within the liberal economic paradigm) to speculate that a move which captures more utility as revenue could generate less total utility, especially when you bring high risk/reward financial modeling into valuation.<p>There are a lot of companies like you describe in the b2b generas. But services for consumers, especially those which are essentially communication services, seem to come up against this sell or grow pressure. I think twitter, Facebook, and many other services which sold at an earlier stage might have better served their &quot;mission&quot; as company&#x27;s an order of magnitude smaller.<p>Think of the impact wikipedia (a nonprofit, but I think it&#x27;s relevant) has had. How could that value possibly be represented by revenue or valuation. Twitter is now under tremendous pressure to create a hyper-profitable advertising business to rival Facebook & Google.<p>Twitter is now 4,000 employees and almost $2bn annual budget (growing at X 2.6 p/a) under pressure to turn twitter into a revenue machine within 12 months. They are employing armies of bizdev, ad sales and support to try and meet this goals. Does that kind of Twitter stand a better chance at value creation than an 800 employee Twitter with a $400k budget would have had?",1410944604

Even listening in to all the communication between the card and the machine would not allow an attacker to make a bogus transaction.<p>Apart from that, making a skimmer that sits between the chip of the card and the contacts of the machine would be much harder to make than the current skimmers. So even if the chip would not sign the transaction but just provide static data if given the right PIN, the situation would be significantly improved.",1410944539
