For a normal weight adult, that&#x27;s about 25 grams.  A can of coke in the US contains 40g of sugar.  Our food labels show daily recommended amounts for everything except sugar.  Why?  Because putting 160% on the can would be bad for Coca Cola.  Too often the USDA protects and defends big business instead of the people.

It&#x27;s essentially the same at that point as if they hadn&#x27;t mentioned anything at all. So you&#x27;re either getting something (a conditional license for the patents) at no direct cost to you, or you&#x27;re getting nothing and losing nothing - how is that a raw deal?<p>These patent grants are commonly used by companies who gather patent portfolios as a means of patent mutually assured destruction. The goal is to ensure that they will never be sued for patent infringement by making sure they have a broad enough patent portfolio to always be able to countersue.<p>Now, if you want to use this and retain the ability to safely sue facebook, you could always negotiate a separate, irrevocable patent license. This is what you would need to do (that, or ignore any potential patents and hope you&#x27;re not sued) in the absence of such a grant in the first place.",1411199692

8343976,comment,8342959,8343893,6,0,ghshephard,,,"&quot;There&#x27;s agriculture competition for the river, not the reservoir. &quot;<p>Given that in this case, the &quot;River&quot; feeds into the &quot;Reservoir&quot; - the two water bodies can be viewed as the same entity for purposes of water sourcing.  Given that only 15% of the Tuolumne is needed for the Reservoir, and 50%+ is required for Agriculture, the major drain on the Tuolumne is not San Francisco residents, but Agriculture.  San Francisco may have rights to the Tuolumne, but I don&#x27;t know whether they are Sr. to the Central Valleys, or, what happens if San Francisco has to turn off the water downstream in order to keep Hetch Hetchy full.<p>But - I do see your point, it&#x27;s not the case that all water comes from the same place - there&#x27;s lots of reservoirs that can&#x27;t be used for Agriculture in the Central valley.  For example, Crystal Springs, a 70k cubic meter reservoir in San Mateo, is entirely for urban use.  There is no agriculture competition for it.  Every gallon we conserve there, is another gallon conserved for city use.<p>But - it&#x27;s important to realize, Cities and Agriculture are in competition for the Sierra Nevada water.  And every gallon that goes to the farms, is one less gallon that goes to the residents.  As the cities conserver more, and more, reducing showers to 5 minutes, and switching to Ultra-Low-Flush .5 gallon flow Toilets, that water is going to become more valuable to city residents, than it will be to agriculture.<p>I&#x27;m not suggesting we don&#x27;t cut back residential usage - I&#x27;m a huge fan of conservation (and an even bigger fan of efficiency) - but, I am saying that we could go to emergency rationing of 50 gallons/day (down from 329 gallons currently), and agriculture could still use up all the Sierra Nevada water.  The inverse isn&#x27;t true - if Agricultural use somehow cut its water use by the same percentage, it would be difficult for residential use to consume the existing supplies.",1411199472

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s trivial for someone with Haskell experience to even verify that code implements the same (or a similar) thing.<p>I also believe it lacks sufficient polymorphism, for instance surrounding the output of the step function, and lacks safety around (notably, but not exclusively) the application of the step function (i.e. to only the last value of the transducer, not just something of that type). So this would be squarely in the tries-to-be-simple category, despite it&#x27;s use of profunctors (don&#x27;t know why that was used here, it&#x27;s not a super-standard abstraction).<p>But this is all beside the larger point. Things generally working is learned through philosophical induction in the case of clojure -- just seeing something work a bunch of times and understanding the mechanisms in some level of detail.

For more background on the technology, read his &quot;Fly by Wire&quot;, which explains why the &quot;miracle on the Hudson&quot; water landing was mostly the work of the computers.<p>This article discusses the other side of cockpit automation, in the context of the Air France 447 crash. The key point here is, as &quot;Boeing’s Delmar Fadden explained, “We say, ‘Well, I’m going to cover the 98 percent of situations I can predict, and the pilots will have to cover the 2 percent I can’t predict.’ This poses a significant problem. I’m going to have them do something only 2 percent of the time. Look at the burden that places on them. First they have to recognize that it’s time to intervene, when 98 percent of the time they’re not intervening. Then they’re expected to handle the 2 percent we couldn’t predict.&quot;<p>This is a key problem in computing. Things are &quot;user friendly&quot;, and don&#x27;t require much understanding, until something goes wrong. Then they require vast amounts of understanding. This is OK (although tacky) for banal applications, but not OK for ones that can kill.<p>Automotive engineers sort of get this. Anti-skid braking systems, traction control, roll control, and air bags are all intended to work properly in emergencies with no user attention.  During normal driving, they do nothing. That&#x27;s as it should be.<p>&quot;Internet of things&quot; people do not get this at all.  They&#x27;re happy to hook a phone app to some actuator (probably via some &quot;cloud&quot;) and let the end user worry about problems.  This will be dangerous for &quot;things&quot; that have any real power.",1411197289

All it took was a few weeks of unemployment and refusal to believe that it couldn&#x27;t be done. For those of you that opt out of reading the source but are curious as to how it works internally: the tool zips all your files, dumps them as hex code, and stuffs them into an argument string for the little known ssh -t option, which carries instructions to undo the whole process on the server side. As a side note, stuffing a linux filesystem into an argument string is the reason why your ~/.sshrc.d can be much bigger than a megabyte - bash doesn&#x27;t like processing commands that are that long.",1411196938

The crux of the issue seems to essentially be:<p>Lemley: <i>&quot;We shouldn&#x27;t allow patents on pure functionality; only on the means of achieving that functionality.&quot;</i> He also phrases this as <i>patenting the solution and not the problem</i>. <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2012/10/mark-lemley-functional-claiming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/2012/10/mark-lemley-functional-claiming...</a><p>Pro-patent people: <i>&quot;Specifying functionality is the way software is developed - just look at any software outsourcing site.

At what point, if ever, should functionality (alone) be patentable? The Supreme Court seems to have gone with &quot;nope, it isn&#x27;t patentable without some new inventive step or hardware&quot;. But that means there&#x27;s no clear line.<p>======<p>A nice hypothetical, quoted from elsewhere, that cuts to the center of the issues:<p><i>Assume that a person has no knowledge of computers or programming at all, but they believe that certain functionality would be profitable, for example – a function that analyzes your food eating habits and work schedule and automatically orders and pays for delivery, so your favorite dish is waiting for you when you get home. Can this person receive a patent? And I want to be very clear here – This person knows nothing about computers, he only knows what function he wants to see them achieve. His specification will read with the same level of expertise as my exposition here does. Why or why not?</i><p>This is quite analogous to much of what&#x27;s been happening in the industry.
