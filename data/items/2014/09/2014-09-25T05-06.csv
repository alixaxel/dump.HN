Its result? Two people charged, with only one having anything to do with terrorism.<p>Just about every ounce of effort was put in to drumming it up as &#x27;averted disaster at the last moment&#x27;, yet very little effort was (probably intentionally) made to mention that the mobilsation of over 800 police resulted in the arrest of exactly 1 person on terrorism-related charges.<p>This is undoubtably an opportunistic move on the back of marginal news. It&#x27;s a travisty and it will pass without much debate because both parties give approximately no care whatsoever about preserving individual freedoms and privacy, and every care about eroding those rights for increased capacity to monitor and police the public.",1411624774

8365826,comment,8362040,8365460,2,0,nkurz,,,"I was presuming that you&#x27;d want more nodes per bucket, but I suppose once you have a hash that can expand and contract efficiently that becomes less of an problem.  The issue though with having an average of 1 node is that about 1/3 of the buckets will have no nodes (wasted space), and about 1/3 will have 2 or more (longer lookups).<p>Yes, for an efficient closed hash of a larger structure, you&#x27;d need to store both a pointer to structure and a means of disambiguation so that that you don&#x27;t have to follow the pointer to (probabilistically) test if you have a matching entry.   For a cuckoo, this might be the hash of the other slot, so it&#x27;s not entirely wasted space, but it would add 8B or so to each entry.  On the other hand, we&#x27;re presuming a large struct anyway, this might not be too much extra burden.<p>The model that I&#x27;m mentally comparing to is an 2-way cuckoo hash with 8 slots per bucket, with a single SIMD compare to test for a match.   It&#x27;s an approach that makes a lot of sense to me.

8365804,comment,8363527,8365237,2,0,lutusp,,,"> FWIW, it&#x27;s always been easier for me to think of it as &#x27;moving&#x27; more quickly along the time axis - which would appear slowed down to someone farther away from the source of the gravity.<p>In reality, it&#x27;s the other way around. At the bottom of a gravity well, time passes more slowly. An astronaut on the moon observing a laser beam from earth&#x27;s surface would see it as red-shifted compared to a local reference, reflecting the fact that time passes more slowly at earth&#x27;s surface than it does on the moon. The other equivalent interpretation under GR is that the light loses energy climbing out of the gravitational field and is therefore red-shifted. One of the beauties of Einstein&#x27;s theory is that, if you do the math using either assumption (slower time or lost energy), the result comes out the same.<p>The classic confirmation of GR conducted in 1919 during a solar eclipse showed that the paths taken by starlight near the temporarily blocked sun were curved toward the sun. This is consistent with the idea that time passes more slowly near the sun. Consider that a light beam a bit closer to the sun would have a longer transit time (because of slower time passage) than one farther away, which would have the effect of curving the stellar light wavefront toward the sun.<p>This article has some graphics and deeper explanations to assist in understanding these ideas:<p><a href=""http://arachnoid.com/relativity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arachnoid.com/relativity</a>",1411623756

The glazier&#x27;s gain is the shopowner&#x27;s loss and so there&#x27;s no net improvement.<p>But that&#x27;s a wholly inappropriate analogy for this situation of expenditure going towards Indian scientists and technicians, because <i>they were engaged in new and productive work</i> rather than merely receiving a subsidy. The Indian government didn&#x27;t have an existing interplanetary program that was scrapped and replaced with another; it built one from scratch. In terms of Bastiat&#x27;s analogy, it would be as if the shopkeeper hired the glazier to install a new window in what had previously been a blank wall.<p>The direct economic value of measuring whether there is methane in Mars&#x27; atmosphere is intangible - just as it would be hard to measure the impact of a newly-added window on a shopkeeper&#x27;s turnover at the time of its installation. It could also be argued that NASA or some other space agency could conduct the same measurement on some future Mars project, and so the ISRO effort is probably duplicative. But even if the direct economic output of the craft itself is assumed to be zero, the development of the satellite manufacturing and launch capability, which is a net economic gain too, whereas the replacement of a broken window does not have any innovative component (since the prior existence of the window means the capability to make it already existed).<p>It seems to me that you and the other two posters who are arguing this position are making the implicit assumption that that NASA <i>et al.</i> have a comparative advantage in the development of space technology and that therefore Indian efforts are economically superfluous, in addition to your general distaste for the notion of government as client.",1411623656

What do you feel is a normal amount of money to have just laying around, ready to be invested in a car?<p>My experience looking for a used car in the greater phoenix area says you can&#x27;t find anything decent for under $10k. Carmax is said to have higher quality used vehicles, but they rarely have anything under $10k (after gov&#x27;t fees and taxes). Also, in this price range, the mileage is usually 100k+. Nobody keeps maintenance records, so to avoid blowing up your engine, you&#x27;ll need to immediately spend $500-900 on a new timing belt. Next, expect your high mileage car to have at least one critical part wear out every other month or so.<p>I searched long and hard and settled on a $6k car. Twelve years old, 150k miles. It was the cheapest car I could find that didn&#x27;t have any obvious problems (Firestone vetted it; turned out to have $3k+ of problems over the next fifteen months). My income was ~45k. What with all the other bills, I needed a loan.<p>It&#x27;s uncommon for a programmer, but the gov&#x27;t census for the area says a combined income of $40-60k is normal. I know my fair share of single mothers who wait tables for a lot less than half of that.<p>I heartily dispute the assertion that it&#x27;s easy to just pay cash for a working car. One last piece of anecdotal evidence to my argument: the ease of selling my high mileage piece of shit car. I put it on craigslist for $1200 and it sold within hours.

If the thesis is false, then there can be black holes at the universe&#x27;s beginning, and they can form today, given the right conditions.<p>> Lots of things that cannot possibly come into existence at the present time did exist at the moment of the Big Bang (and shortly afterward), because the conditions back then were so radically different from they are now.<p>Not so different, and from a theoretical standpoint, they lie on a continuum from the present to the past. The condition of the universe as a whole has changed over time, but from the present we can mimic earlier conditions using high energies.<p>It is often said that one goal of accelerator technology is to move backward in time toward the Big Bang. As technology advances, as accelerator energies increase, we create conditions more like the conditions in the early universe. The ultimate hope is to create conditions as much as possible like the first few seconds of the universe&#x27;s existence, to be able to see the genesis of present conditions and refine physical theory.<p>> Perhaps the only singularity that ever existed was the Universe at the moment of the Big Bang. After the One Singularity has blown itself apart, no other singularity can come into existence. I don&#x27;t see any inconsistency in that scenario.<p>A physicist would immediately see the inconsistency in that. If the conditions of the Big Bang theory can exist in reality, then given the same conditions of temperature and pressure, we should be able to imitate an earlier reality on a small scale.

8365711,comment,8364643,8365642,5,0,skuhn,,,"There are many pros and cons to EC2 vs managed hosting vs operating it yourself.<p>I meant that in this particular case, you are likely to have fewer headaches from this issue in your own datacenter because:<p>1. You probably don&#x27;t run Xen in the first place.<p>2. If you do, this vulnerability may not be critical to you. I&#x27;m guessing that it is exploitable via the other instances on a host. If you don&#x27;t share hardware with other companies, then a co-tenancy exploit may not be a huge deal.<p>3. And if the vulnerability is critical to you, you may be able to better schedule the maintenance for your own particular business needs. Fix half your hosts, fail over, fix the other half; schedule it during your particular low traffic period.<p>The scope of the issue is also smaller, you just have to solve the problem for your use cases rather than the massive undertaking this is for Amazon.<p>I don&#x27;t think this one incident means EC2 is bad and real hardware is good, forever and ever. There are tradeoffs to everything.",1411621362
