8344140,comment,8341991,8342253,1,0,rquirk,,,"I&#x27;ve just tried it with my own apps.<p>Features - it is missing logging of any sort, so when an app crashes you don&#x27;t know why. You can&#x27;t use adb logcat nor presumably connect a debugger (I just use logcat most of the time anyway). e.g. an app I&#x27;m working on crashes when trying to use the &quot;share&quot; feature. this is probably to be expected, but without a log or anything it&#x27;s tricky to know why. A game I made uses the NDK and despite having the x86 version of the library in the APK, it crashes on startup.<p>Speed - this is the killer feature! The emulator is useless (at least on Linux) as the native drivers cause it to hang IME, the startup time is too large, and when running an app is too slow to really judge its usage. You can use the emulator in a pinch, but better to test on devices. This means plugging them in and swapping devices (first world problems ;), which is a bit of a pain.<p>Convenience - the regular build-install-debug cycle is incorporated into the Android build system, whereas with this solution you have to faff about running your own scripts to execute chromeos-apk on the APK, then install by hand from the extensions screen. However you can debug right on the same PC without having to have a phone or tablet available.<p>So the main difference is speed and a bit of convenience. It is as fast as running the app on a real Android device, without having to have one handy. I can see why Google didn&#x27;t release this for all apps yet, as there are a lot of places that it crashes out. But it&#x27;s really cool that this works at all, and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll only get better.",1411206768

I&#x27;m genuinely puzzled by how you use so much water every day.<p>Previously at the end of a 10-year drought and very low reserves, the government target was 155 litres/day, which was easily done - our household was using about 65-75 litres/day/person, while still doing laundry, daily showering, and keeping a garden.

Hence we are only interested in cases which are isomorphic with the location being set on both branches.<p>We can treat this as a phi node following the if: there is one output value, which has been created in one of two different ways.

One of Sun&#x27;s original goals with Java was making it the client-side scripting language for the browser. However, Netscape had LiveScript. Apparently the negotiations almost broke down over this point.<p>In an enlightened moment, (probably) Marc Andreessen proposed renaming LiveScript to JavaScript (despite the fact that the languages have very little in common), and joy was had. Sun got the JavaScript trademark (and passed it on to Oracle), and Netscape got a perpetual <i>exclusive</i> license to use it.<p>When JavaScript was standardized to avoid Embrace, Extend, Extinguish, Netscape refused to share its license, and so the official language was renamed to ECMAScript, after the standards body. When Sun was bought by Oracle, it also got the trademark, and presumably, Mozilla inherited the exclusive license from Netscape.<p>_____<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO1Wnu-xKoY#t=430"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RO1Wnu-xKoY#t=430</a>",1411204942

8344090,comment,8339280,8339825,1,0,sjolsen,,,"Assembly code would fail to demonstrate the point. The graphs are meant to demonstrate that, temporally speaking, the basic actions being performed by the abstract machine are partially ordered. A consequence of these actions being temporally <i>partially ordered</i> is that two individual actions may be temporally <i>unordered</i>, or &quot;unsequenced.&quot; The undefined behaviour comes, roughly speaking, when a &quot;write&quot; action is unsequenced with a &quot;read&quot; or &quot;write&quot; action on the same memory location. This scenario corresponds graphically to a red box and a red/blue box unconnected by any single-direction chain of arrows.<p>Anyway, the problem with using assembly is that it imposes an artificial temporal total ordering on the actions being performed. Under temporal total ordering, the possibility of unsequenced actions disappears, and the message is lost.<p>>no-one outside of compiler developers has the right vocabulary for descriptions to work<p>There&#x27;s nothing here specific to implementing compilers. There are a few uses of standardese and graph theory, but they&#x27;re relatively basic concepts that are important to familiarize yourself with if you want to use tools like C++ effectively.",1411204739
