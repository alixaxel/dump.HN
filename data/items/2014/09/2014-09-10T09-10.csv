Stack Overflow runs on a single not-that-beefy master-slave DB system.<p>Typical web applications are insanely amenable to read caches, and that&#x27;s where you do most of your scaling.

I now drive into the city and pay for parking in NCP/hospital car parks. I don&#x27;t get charged for congestion charge because I drive an exempt vehicle. This happens once a week for me and it&#x27;s cheap and very easy. The CC zone is pretty easy to get around and the supposed bus lane advantage is null as they have loading bays all up and down them and people don&#x27;t give way to taxis and busses pulling into normal traffic.<p>5) London taxis don&#x27;t always take the most efficient route. They take the msot profitable. This isn&#x27;t universally true but I&#x27;ve been in many a taxi taking complicated back street routes when the main route would suffice. They are charged both on time and distance but distance is considerably more profitable.<p>So if there&#x27;s more than 2 people in the car, the car is CC exempt, even if you pay for parking, getting around London is bliss and cheap.<p>Plus you can stick the radio on whatever you want rather than Capital FM which is all cabbies seem to listen to.",1410340706

8295641,comment,8293959,8294768,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"&quot;Rights&quot; (in this context) are things to which one has a legal claim.  Property ownership is a right.  Rights may be limited or unlimited, alienable or inalienable (which is to say, <i>transferrable</i>), or absolute or non-absolute (which is frequently confused with alienability).<p>An absolute right granted by law (e.g., Constitutional Rights which may not be infringed, or if you subscribe to them, universal human rights) would generally superscede others.  There&#x27;s a fairly strong argument <i>against</i> such rights in general, and I happen to see the discussion of rights in general as being greatly muddied.<p>That&#x27;s <i>not</i> to say that many of the claims <i>granted</i> by these rights are bad.  I think there are very strong arguments in favor of free speech (though not unlimited), of freedom of religion, of due process.  Also of education and healthcare, possibly of a minimum income.  Other rights I&#x27;m less convinced of, particularly in a resource-constrained world.<p>But the right to remove someone from their home without consequence strikes me as a peculiar one.  Even Russia&#x27;s serfs were considered to be <i>bound to the land</i>.  They couldn&#x27;t be moved separately from it (nor did they have the right to move themselves, but this wasn&#x27;t terribly different from restraints on internal migration, say, as in England under its Poor Laws in the 17th century).",1410340133

Therefore, all the advantages of both minicabs and taxis are available to the operator, but without the disadvantages peculiar to each.<p>You might say that this workaround is a clever disruption of an established, outdated business model, but if Uber drives a significant number of cabbies out of business, then how are independent wheelchair users going to get around efficiently?
