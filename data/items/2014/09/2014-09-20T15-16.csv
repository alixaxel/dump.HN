They carry our data. As such we trust them very much.<p>The full quote of what TBL said was this:<p>&quot;We need rules,&quot; said Berners-Lee. &quot;If businesses are to move here and start here rather than start in Europe or Brazil or Australia — they&#x27;re going to look around and make sure, &#x27;Oh, does the power stay up?&#x27; And they&#x27;ll look for other things. &#x27;Is the Internet open?&#x27; Will they have to effectively bribe their ISPs to start a new service? That&#x27;s what it looks like from the outside. It&#x27;s bribery.&quot;<p>In other words, if you need to pay the gate-keeper for equal access to the subscribers then that&#x27;s bribery because the common-carrier principle holds that no priority should be given to other people&#x27;s packets over yours (&#x27;without discrimination&#x27;) and VV. Allowing such differentiation could for instance cripple any voice-over-ip offering that was not sanctioned via deep packet inspection.<p>That&#x27;s what this is about, not about a narrow definition of bribery, not every word is to be taken literally but in this case it is close enough that I don&#x27;t think you can pretend that you did not understand the slight metaphorical component and simply acknowledge that a gatekeeper that needs payment where none should be due is tantamount to having to bribe someone.<p>Uber does not enter into it.",1411228411

Netscape wanted Java but wasn&#x27;t willing to kill off their scripting language, so they agreed to name it JavaScript to make it sound like the two are related (and JS being &quot;merely&quot; a scripting language, people would still prefer Java for &quot;real&quot; programs).<p>Apparently LiveScript was also originally planned to be more Lisp-like but then they went with C-like syntax because that was more popular at the time (see Java). And the entire language was cobbled together in a ridiculously short time frame (something like a couple of weeks?) and intended to be &quot;beginner friendly&quot;, which is where a lot of the language&#x27;s quirks come from.<p>Considering the original JS already contained the syntax Crockford would eventually define as JSON, you could say they managed to create not one but two languages at once. Say what you will about JS being a good language or not, but you have to respect that achievement.<p>Considering JS only became ECMAScript because Netscape was scared of incompatible copycats, you could argue JS as it is today wouldn&#x27;t exist without Microsoft, too.

Hence the Jingle &quot;That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m stuck on Band-Aid BRAND and Band-Aids stuck on me.&quot;  Emphasis mine.  When do you ever hear the word Brand in a jingle or marketing message outside the 60&#x27;s?&quot;  Only when the product is in danger of loosing it&#x27;s trademark due to common use (or crappy naming teams like the ones at Microsoft).",1411225500

Back then Microsoft named their EMCAScript implementation &quot;JScript&quot; to avoid problems with Sun&#x27;s trademark (I&#x27;m sure everyone on here is already aware that Oracle bought Sun a few years back).<p>However I don&#x27;t think this trademark is worth anything to Oracle any longer. Trademarks need to be defended or they&#x27;re lost. This is why Wordpress have strict rules about how themes and related websites cannot contain the name &quot;Wordpress&quot;; and why you often see ridiculous cases about large companies sending scary legal notices to independent enterprises but then quietly settling out of court for token licence fees like £100 a year.<p>Javascript has long since entered the public domain so I suspect it&#x27;s too late for Oracle to capitalise on their acquired trademark.",1411225238
