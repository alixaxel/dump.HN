As others have pointed out there&#x27;s insane limits on things like count queries. There is 1000 record limit on queries in general. The performance of cloudcode between the db is awful, you have to batch everything into tiny operations or risk timeouts. Skip has a 10k record limit. Their web based data browser tool seems unfinished, for instance you can&#x27;t even insert into relational columns and deleting 100 records at a time locks up my browser.<p>This guy has compiled a good list of limitations: <a href=""http://profi.co/all-the-limits-of-parse/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://profi.co/all-the-limits-of-parse/</a><p>It may be okay for very simple applications but for anything non trivial or with a large db I would not recommend it.

The easiest way to make bash sane is to put everything in functions.  Then everything can be tested interactively.  I don&#x27;t know why people put 300+ lines of code at the top level -- that makes changes very difficult to test.<p>A good trick for this is to put:<p><pre><code>  &quot;$@&quot;\n</code></pre>\nat the bottom when you are testing.  Then you can do:<p><pre><code>  ./myscript.sh func-name arg1 arg2 ..\n</code></pre>\nIf you really want, you can change it to<p><pre><code>  main &quot;$@&quot;\n</code></pre>\nbefore deploying so it only runs the main function.  Those lines, and constants, should be the ONLY things at the top level of a bash script IMO (even a 10 line one).<p>Don&#x27;t stare at bash code without running it -- that&#x27;s crazy.  I have taught Python and also admonish people to not &quot;stare&quot; at their code; just form a hypothesis and run it.

It&#x27;s not just that lawyers are dispassionate, doctors are also dispassionate, and people don&#x27;t hate doctors nearly as much as lawyers. It&#x27;s that you miss the forest for the trees.<p>Categories are inherently imprecise, and focusing on them exclusively leads one to focus on delineation of experience as the ultimate arbiter. Categories cannot prefectly map reality, normal people know this, while lawyers ignore this. Those vague moral arguments are what matters to moral people, not some outdated belief that Aristotelian categorization somehow can properly capture reality.<p>Lawyers categorize circumstance and then map the law onto those categories. When the law doesn&#x27;t map well to circumstance, or when we cannot properly categorize the facts, we have questions of interpretation.<p>&quot;When does a change in degree become a change in kind?&quot;, or &quot;Do we need a law of the horse?&quot; Both questions assume categorization as the problem.

Then you would also have to wrap the results vector in a class that then addrefs the original string wrapper class.<p>But after that, handing out pointers to the contents of the string would be no problem as the results class would addref the string class and then release it when done ensuring that the string wrapper class remains alive as long as the results object has not gone out of scope.<p>Of course Rust&#x27;s approach of alerting you when your code path causes dangling pointers is also interesting, but I wonder how that would work if you were to link against a static library that handed out references to internal objects like that - could the compiler see the scoping problem?",1411324869

(Corona is a beer drunk by relaxed, young, attractive people; that&#x27;s the crowd I want to identify with, so I&#x27;ll drink Corona -- this is classic social proof, one of Cialdini&#x27;s six principles. And, incidentally, this works best on people being forced to make a decision that makes little difference, such as pick a beer or laundry soap.)<p>So the problem isn&#x27;t so much that the thesis is wrong, as that it is <i>naively</i> right, but is simply explaining the mechanism by which existing theory in fact applies.",1411324528

It certainly seems like e.g. adding a row to a DataTable would be what most users would call &quot;faster&quot;.<p>Also, consider how this app scales. Requiring that the server re-build a page for every user interaction is a lot more work for the server vs. sending a big blob of HTML + assets once (CDNJS and similar services also affect how this performs). Given how powerful even a low-end few-year-old smartphone in the US is these days, I doubt that it would be a better experience to make an app like todo rely on server-side processing.<p>I do agree that javascript isn&#x27;t /always/ the right tool, but building a few smaller API back-end + JS app front-end things lately been pretty convincing for me that JS + AJAX + REST API is a better UX for lots of things vs submit-and-rebuild.

Most of the requirements relate to risk assessment, policies, training, incident response, etc.<p>With that in mind, I&#x27;m going to quickly run down all of the major moving parts and then cover some of the technical considerations for setting up a server.<p>HIPAA has three main rules you need to comply with:<p>1. The Privacy Rule - Governs the use and disclosure of PHI (protected health information). Applies to all forms of PHI (verbal, written, electronic, etc.).<p>2. The Security Rule - Governs safeguards for electronic PHI<p>3. The Breach Notification Rule - Governs your responsibilities during a security or privacy incident<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>The Security Rule has a general security standard, some documentation/retention rules, and three sections of safeguards. They are:<p>1. Administrative Safeguards<p>2. Physical Safeguards<p>3. Technical Safeguards<p>Some of the safeguards are mandatory. Some are &quot;addressable,&quot; meaning if you don&#x27;t implement them you must document why you chose not to and what other safeguards you applied instead.<p><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i><p>Most likely, you&#x27;re going to start with something like the following for your servers:<p>1. Sign a BAA with any service provider who is going to touch PHI for you.<p>2. Restrict physical and logical server access to authorized individuals. Document how you restrict access and why the methods chosen are reasonable and appropriate given the risk posture of your organization. (There&#x27;s a LOT packed into this step.)<p>3. Log all access and data modification events. If you use a logging service that isn&#x27;t HIPAA-compliant, make sure you&#x27;re not including PHI data you send them.<p>4. Encrypt data at rest and in transit, including inside the network perimeter. Document your network topology and access points.<p>5. Implement backups according to your organization&#x27;s HIPAA contingency/disaster recovery plan. Document the backup scheme.<p>A few caveats:<p>- I haven&#x27;t addressed application-level security. The same requirements apply, but the implementation differs.<p>- Your customers will demand additional safeguards that aren&#x27;t in HIPAA.<p>At Aptible, we help with all of this, plus all of the other requirements (risk assessment, policies, training, etc.), so you can get a complete handle on your compliance status.",1411323035

In other words input and output of eval must have the same data-type.<p>A good example is JavaScript, often called a &quot;lisp-like&quot; language. In JavaScript you have the function Function() which takes a String as input and produces a Function. Thus a JavaScript program can create another program which it executes within itself. But it is not homoiconic: input of Function() is a String, and its output is a Function. You can not pass the output of Function() as an input to another call of Function().",1411322984

But the code that uses them can be. I can also use existing Haskell libraries mixed with this (which are type-safe). For example:<p>tail&#x27; &quot;-f&quot; &quot;foo.txt&quot; $= withRights (intoCSV def $= CL.map (\\[a,b,c] -> b <> &quot;\\n&quot;)) $= grep &quot;--line-buffered&quot; &quot;^4&quot;<p>This line streams lines from foo.txt, parses each one with the CSV conduit parser[1], takes the second value and then feeds that into grep which spits out only columns which match the regex ^4. Or if I wanted to match only valid email addresses, I could import Text.Email.Validate and use this conduit:<p>… $= CL.filter isValid $= …<p>Which, again, comes from a normal Haskell package[2] which validates RFC 5322 emails with a full parser. I can also just extract the domain part of valid emails:<p>… $= CL.mapMaybe emailAddress $= CL.map domainPart $= …<p>I&#x27;m operating on structured, well-typed data in between normal UNIX pipes, in a streaming manner. I think that&#x27;s pretty sexy.<p>Finally, when I decide this script is getting more complex than a mere script, I don&#x27;t have to worry about maintaining it or refactoring it. I&#x27;m already using Haskell!<p>There&#x27;s also the personal benefit to me, my editor support for Haskell is very good.

8347800,comment,8344966,8345844,1,0,captainmuon,,,"> The Internet will need a new protocol for apps, rather than documents.<p>A bit off-topic (sorry), but that&#x27;s a good point. I believe it would be great for a future version of HTML to have two &#x27;profiles&#x27;, one for documents and one for apps. The document metaphor is great for, well, plain documents, but it is problematic for apps, like Gmail. For example it can be annoying if you have JS-heavy sites which break document-related features (navigation, resizing, printing, copying).<p>Have a document profile where you have all the markup features, but the javascript features are possibly restricted. This corresponds to a lean version of HTML5. You know HTML6-doc pages will look reasonable and load quickly on all devices, including on ebooks and printed out.<p>Then have a app profile where you don&#x27;t even need a document - you can just draw on canvasses if you want, but you can also create HTML elements. I imagine that people write GUI libraries for it. You have access to all fancy modern JS features, like sockets, webcam, etc.. This would be the time to change the wierd security model of HTML - a page with the DOCTYPE HTML6-app would opt into a new model, where pages <i>don&#x27;t</i> have access to all credentials and cookies by default, so it is reasonably safe to give them net access (they can&#x27;t buy stuff if you are logged into amazon in another tab, for example).<p>The best thing is, we can start using these new paradigms today - and maybe have nice little badges to show we are following the new &quot;best practice&quot; :-). Restict yourself to minimal, presentational, progressive-enhancement JS for documents, use semantic markup, check that it looks good on all devices etc.. And when you are doing a (single-page) app, it doesn&#x27;t have to look like a document, but heed all the advice for non-web desktop or mobile apps - and make sure your app doesn&#x27;t break navigation.",1411322821
