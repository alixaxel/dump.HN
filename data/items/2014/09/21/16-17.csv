Marginal revenue is very high.  And then there&#x27;s something about keeping revenue and costs pretty close even though the entity is in &#x27;start-up mode&#x27;.

8347556,comment,8346570,8347125,3,0,networked,,,">Every so often, after a particularly painful bout with interactive Bash, I find myself mentally designing some shell replacement based on some other language, sometimes custom, sometimes something like Python.<p>I would suggest trying Tcl for this use case. I found it to be just the right language with which to replace shell scripts. The syntax and the built-in command set are easily mapped from those of sh (Tcl has &quot;cd&quot;!), however, it has saner and  more straightforward semantics than the POSIX shell (like how variable expansion and quoting are handled [1]) as well as more features (e.g, instead of &#x27;set -e&#x27; you get real exceptions on errors that you can catch). Tcl also pushes the idea of all values being strings to the point of arguably being homoiconic. A big boon is that external *nix commands are easy to mix with the built-in commands thanks to &#x27;exec&#x27; and &#x27;open |command&#x27;. For piping external commands &#x27;exec&#x27; understands the shell pipeline syntax but generic pipelines can be implemented as well [2].<p>If you need to ship scripts Jim Tcl, a smaller implementation of the languages, is worth looking into. It is portable and self-contained  enough to be used as the basis for a build system [3] and mostly fixes one of Tcl biggest flaws, the lack of closures. Despite the small size it&#x27;s a real programming language with very reasonable performance and great UTF-8 support, including in regular expressions; I&#x27;m making a toy embedded web microframework for it and I was able to get it to service up to 50 requests per second running on an old Palm Pre Plus, which is a pretty slow device.<p>One of the best things about Tcl is eltclsh [4], which allows you to use Tcl as an interactive shell  with readline editing and  tab completion for commands, variables and filesystem paths. It removes the need to use &#x27;exec&#x27; for external commands; when a command is not recognized eltclsh as a procedure or a built-in it looks for it under  $PATH. Admittedly, I don&#x27;t run eltclsh as my login shell but for complex file system manipulation I find it highly useful. Another great feature is that with TclVFS installed and mounted you can &#x27;cd&#x27; to FTP paths and copy files from HTTP paths, e.g.,<p><pre><code>    cd ftp://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel\n</code></pre>\nAs for other alternatives to shell suitable for both scripting and interactive use, Racket&#x27;s XREPL mode could be a candidate if you added path completion to it and maybe  ParEdit-like functionality or some kind of autosuggestion for placing parentheses as you type. (I know some people swear by scsh [5] as a shell replacement for scripting but it lacks readline and completion.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/Tcl.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.5/TclCmd/Tcl.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://wiki.tcl.tk/17419"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.tcl.tk/17419</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://msteveb.github.io/autosetup/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://msteveb.github.io/autosetup/</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/eltclsh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/eltclsh</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://scsh.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scsh.net/</a>",1411318198

8347538,comment,8346642,8347263,6,0,overgard,,,"> What OpenGL does is hard<p>If you think what browsers do is easy... :-)<p>Here&#x27;s the thing though: most of what OpenGL screws up is the not-hard stuff. Here are the main things wrong with OpenGL right now:<p>* Everything operates on and modifies implicit global state, especially with the various &quot;bind&quot; patterns (direct state access will help a lot with this). Even a first year CS student knows global state is bad. It was sort of acceptable-if-ugly back when the fixed function pipeline was the thing, but for almost the last 10 years that&#x27;s been deprecated, and with how you program a GPU now that global state and bind patterns is ridiculous.<p>* Error handling is unfriendly and confusing and slow. It&#x27;s very easy to accidentally send in a bad parameter to a function, have OpenGL silently ignore it, only for something to blow up in your program in a completely different module because that error went silently unchecked. This is just bad. Not only that, but glGetError rarely gives you any useful information. Why can&#x27;t it at least tell me what function failed, and which parameter/value it was that made it fail? A lot of times you&#x27;ll see an error in a complex function like glTexImage2d that has a ton of possible parameter combinations for &quot;invalid value&quot;. Well, which one is invalid? What inputs would be valid? The driver knows, so why can&#x27;t it tell me?<p>> Not like IE which was/is stagnant because of big company sluggishness/exceptionalism, but because its open source trying to do a huge amount with limited resources.<p>Have you looked at the companies that comprise the khronos group? They&#x27;re not exactly poor. The problem isn&#x27;t resources, it&#x27;s bad design by committee.",1411317787

They advertise the lowest price they can offer OR the highest price sufficient to undercut the competition, whichever of these is higher.

8347470,comment,8347163,8347163,4,0,EGreg,,,"I was looking forward with amusement to reading such an article. Mainly because I realized that all the arguments the doctor would make would come down to decision making. He could pose vague rhetorical questions (&quot;do you treat the MRI or the patient?&quot;) but at the end of the day it&#x27;s about collecting data, analyzing it, making a decision (about diagnosis etc), and informing the patient. All the things that he discusses, therefore, are about justifying a human doing it instead of a computer. A human currently has the advantage in certain &quot;soft&quot; undefinable aspects of decision making, which we can call intuition. But if this is eventually formalized into a algorithm whose performance can be measured and quantified vis a vis human doctor performance, it will be like computer image recognition. In some cases it will be obvious that the computer has erred, but for the majority of cases it will be able to notice things humans don&#x27;t, because of the sheer amount of collective experience around the world as well as correlations that humans may not have been able to detect.<p>(I should pause here and note the danger of confirming nontestable theories though, as Karl Popper once wrote, &quot;<i>Once, in 1919, I reported to him a case which to me did not seem particularly Adlerian, but which he found no difficulty in analyzing in terms of his theory of inferiority feelings, Although he had not even seen the child. Slightly shocked, I asked him how he could be so sure. &quot;Because of my thousandfold experience,&quot; he replied; whereupon I could not help saying: &quot;And with this new case, I suppose, your experience has become thousand-and-one-fold.&quot;</i>&quot; <a href=""http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/popper_falsification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/popper_falsification.htm...</a>)<p>Go back and look at all the arguments the doctor makes. Once you remove the vague handwaving, you&#x27;re still left with the basic question: what are you measuring, analyzing and deciding? Can computer aided methods do it better and more accurately, and in the areas they can&#x27;t, why not, exactly? - and can this be improved? If so, it&#x27;s a matter of time.<p>I am not saying a computer can replace a nurse&#x27;s bedside manner or a doctor&#x27;s ability to make the final call but computer aided medicine would seem to be as superior to regular medicine as computer aided chessplaying has long been shown to be superior to both grandmasters and computers alone.<p>Even the maxim he quoted, that doctors should only measure things that may affect the diagnosis or treatment, is a heiristic not unlike the chess heuristics that guide grandmasters&#x27; thinking. But how often does a tactical line or particular &quot;hidden&quot; property of a position override that heuristic? And similarly, a computer can help uncover hidden correlations that a simple human rule may miss. After all, medicine thought for millennia that washing hands was just a ritual with no medical benefit until bacteria were discovered.",1411316289

Lock-in mentality is the reason. Never mind that Apple is doing Metal and AMD is doing Mantle because of defined, demonstrable issues with higher-level abstractions, both GLES and DX11 respectively. <i>Certainly</i> never mind that DX12 is shaping up to provide the same sort of low-level primitives as Mantle/libgnm/Metal. No, they&#x27;re just hissss lock-in hissss. Can&#x27;t possibly be because, like, it&#x27;s a better option, can&#x27;t have that. Like, do you know how many calls you have to make to accomplish stuff in some basic OpenGL extensions? And how much less you can do without the significant amounts of overhead it causes--overhead you can&#x27;t remove because it&#x27;s in the spec and now it never goes away?<p>Did you ever stop to think, for just one second amidst your &quot;<i>there is no reason</i>&quot; absolutism about something it certainly sounds like you don&#x27;t know much about past laymanship...maybe they&#x27;re <i>not</i> laymen and maybe they have a good reason for stripping away abstraction? Not even providing their own incompatible abstraction, but just getting rid of it? I mean, Snidely Whiplash wants to make his platform dev-friendly too, but instead of doing that he gives you this bleeding bare-metal API? Come on. Have you stopped to give these guys an ounce of credit?<p>.<p>And complaining about a &quot;release schedule resulting in outdated hardware&quot; fails to comprehend that &quot;outdated hardware&quot; is every nine months. That is a <i>feature</i>, so that normal people don&#x27;t have to go buy nVidia GTX9581 Platinum Edition cards every two years. Your position frankly beggars belief. The PC gaming treadmill sucks. The mobile treadmill sucks. And you want to make people jump to it on consoles? <i>Do you know a normal person?</i>",1411315323
