(not including the many proprietary ones).<p>Why a pure messaging app (like Whatsapp) wants to do voice, and why a pure voice app (like Viber) started doing messaging. Perhaps, both are needed within the same app to make it all work - but then why don&#x27;t they do email? Why not have an app that calls, messages and mails? :)<p>Well smartphones are probably that app - they are a great communication tool just because they enable SMS, email and voice call together (all in the same seamless package).<p>Would love to get some thoughts about where you think this app sits in the communication app spectrum - what need it fulfills (I can&#x27;t see using it, because it does nothing for me).

When I started in this business decades ago, everyone programmed in assembly language -- we had no choice. When C came along, people thought they had been transported to heaven. A compiler that worked on more than one platform! Control structures that made sense! I/O that continued to work regardless of platform!<p>I wrote my best-known program, Apple Writer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Writer</a>), in assembly. It became a best seller primarily because it was so fast compared to the alternatives, and it had such a small memory footprint in systems that had a tiny amount of memory. The entry-model Apple II had 4 kilobytes of RAM. For a few thousand dollars extra, you could get a total of 16 kilobytes. Wow -- sixteen kilobytes!<p>Then C++ came along, then the STL, then more compilers for more platforms. The idea of only having to write a program once for multiple platforms was difficult to imagine until I saw it for the first time.<p>> C/C++ is different, I&#x27;m afraid of pointers.<p>Pointers is one issue, but not a very important one -- I have no doubt that you can figure them out. You also need to do your own memory management. C++ classes have destructors so you can clean up after yourself. In spite of this, even the best programmers have programs that leak memory -- allocating and freeing memory can be very tricky.<p>> How do I learn C and C++ when I love high-level languages?<p>But C and C++ <i>are</i> high-level languages.

The author makes the mistake of inferring an architecture from observed behavior and fails to ascertain where the warts come from, the architecture or the implementation. They aren&#x27;t the only one, its a common problem. The result though is kind like playing &#x27;architecture telephone&#x27; where each person implements what they think is the architecture implied and ends up with something subtly different than intended. The result is a hodgepodge of features around various parts of the system.<p>In the interest of full disclosure I must admit I was on duty when AT&T and Sun were creating the unholy love child of System V and BSD, I&#x27;m sorry.<p>The <i>architecture</i>, as bespoke by AT&T system engineers, was that process 1 was a pseudo process which configured the necessary services and devices which were appropriate for an administrator defined level of operation. Aka a &#x27;run level.&#x27; I think they would have liked the systemd proposal, but they would no doubt take it completely out of the process space. I am sure they would have wanted it to be some sort of named stream into the inner consciousness of the kernel which could configure the events system so that the desired running configuration was made manifest. They always hated the BSD notion that init was just the first &#x27;shell process&#x27; which happened to kick off various processes that made for a multi-user experience.<p>Originally users were just like init, in that you logged in and everything you did was a subprocess of your original login shell. It was a very elegant system, root&#x27;s primal shell spawned getty, and getty would spawn a shell for a user when they logged in, everything from that point on would be owned by the user just like everything that happened before was owned by root. The user&#x27;s login shell logged out and everything they had done got taken down and resources reclaimed. When the root shell (init) logged out all resources got reclaimed and the system halted.<p>But Linux, like SunOS before it, serves two masters. The server which has some pretty well defined semantics and the &quot;desktop user&quot; which has been influenced a whole bunch by microcomputer operating systems like Windows.<p>I wasn&#x27;t the owner of the init requirements document, I think Livsey was, the important thing was that it was written in the context of a bigger systems picture, and frankly systemd doesn&#x27;t have that same context. I think that is what comes across as confusion.",1411452861
