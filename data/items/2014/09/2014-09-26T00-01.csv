I therefore thought it was pretty rock-solid that black holes DO exist because my collaborators (astronomers at Caltech) refer casually to blazars (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blazar</a>) and AGNs as black holes.  They have never qualified these statements.<p>Thus, yesterday&#x27;s article (with its very strong claim, literally, &quot;there is no such thing as a black hole&quot;) puzzled me, and I didn&#x27;t believe it.  And, there was no pushback in the HN comment thread, which was a double surprise.<p>The article you&#x27;ve linked mentions the difference between stellar-mass black holes that result from gravitational collapse, and larger black holes that, in the best-known cases, are at the core of galaxies and form differently.  This caveat helps give some context to the question.<p>I note that the article you link, and the earlier article, are clearly still in conflict, because yesterday&#x27;s article flatly denies these super-massive objects are black holes.",1411693186

8370726,comment,8369457,8370514,8,0,jackowayed,,,"For most changes of habits where it&#x27;s possible, taking a hard line is much easier.<p>When I went vegetarian, I went cold turkey. The first two weeks, I wanted meat all the time, and it was hard to resist the temptation to eat it. The next month or so, I still wasn&#x27;t sure I&#x27;d be able to keep it up, but it was easier.<p>Since then (years), I sometimes want meat, but it&#x27;s gotten far easier.<p>I sometimes think about loosening up--I&#x27;ve considered rules like eating it once in awhile if I know it was humanely and environmentally raised (as much as possible), or bringing seafood back, or even eating meat that I know will otherwise go bad (which basically ends all my ethical objections).<p>The biggest reason I haven&#x27;t is that it would be way harder and probably make my life worse overall. At this point, being vegetarian is super easy. I only sort of remember what most meat tastes like, I&#x27;m very used to not eating it, and I know I can do it.<p><i>Critically, it&#x27;s never a decision I have to make; it&#x27;s a given.</i> If I made the line blurrier, then every time I saw meat that looked good, I would have to make a decision. The cognitive load of being a vegetarian would skyrocket, and I would probably have more of a feeling of missing out because I would think more about the possibility of not missing out.",1411693168

And the problem with Swift is that it tried to do so many things at once, even with the hard constraints it had. And this is precisely why the language ends up short of its goal.<p>Speaking of ObjC 3.0, the point of the author is simply that an incremental improvement on ObjC which simply removes redundant syntax from ObjC would have been just as useful but much easier to get up and running.<p>The features that Swift tries to incorporate are admirable and interesting for the most part, but the implementation falls short because it&#x27;s quite simply too ambitious to even reach &quot;usable&quot; until 3.0 or something.",1411693101
8370718,comment,8363527,8370527,1,0,lutusp,,,"> You might be describing something close to science in some ideal but certainly not what it looks like in reality.<p>Wait, are we discussing science or the problems science is designed to solve? You could make your remarks just as well about law, arguing that, because laws are broken, therefore they shouldn&#x27;t exist, or they don&#x27;t really mean what they say. You could also say this about mathematics, which only rarely exactly agrees with experience, but is still extremely useful in making predictions about an imperfect world.<p>Science is meant to be an ideal, that&#x27;s its purpose.<p>> If you want to rule out everything where there&#x27;s a strong human, non-mechanical element from the world of science, then there&#x27;s very little science going on to talk about.<p>How are you missing the point that science is supposed to represent an alternative to everyday human affairs? And how are you missing the fact that, no matter how emotionally attached to a particular outcome, no matter how driven, a person still has to toe the science line in order to accomplish anything useful?<p>> ... I don&#x27;t think it serves any useful purpose to pretend that science actually happens in a clean room.<p>True -- only good science, memorable science, happens in a clean room.<p>I can&#x27;t believe you haven&#x27;t figured out that science exists precisely because people are the way they are. If this were not the case, if people could divorce themselves from passion and perceptual distortions when circumstances required it, there would be no science -- what we call science would be one variety of normal human behavior and no one would think about it.",1411693059
8370717,comment,8369457,8370513,3,0,SeoxyS,,,"The way you described it looked like trolling, hence the downvotes, I think. But your thinking is sound. People most commonly count their alcohol in shots and shot-equivalents.<p>1.5oz = 44ml. Most liquor is 40% ABV. That&#x27;s ~18mL of pure alcohol.<p>The average beer bottle size is 330mL - 500mL, at 4-6% ABV. Again, that&#x27;s in the 16-25mL of pure alcohol range.<p>Maybe rounding to 20mL might be a better definition of a &quot;unit&quot; of alcohol. It&#x27;s still easy enough to do math with, and more representative of what people consider one drink.",1411693051

Unlike the simple atom by atom nanotech\nconstructors common today, a UC would combine millions upon millions of atoms in\na parallel process that could produce materials or mechanisms of unmatched\nintricacy on a scale currently not possible even with the best nanoscale\nfoundry.<p>> One of the most obvious applications of a UC -- if its construction were ever\npractical -- would be the genetic manipulation of lifeforms at the atomic level\nto cure disease, correct congenial defects, or expand their capabilities in\nbeneficial ways. Theoretically, if an &quot;intelligent,&quot; real-time control program\nwere developed for the UC, then autonomous, artificial nanoscale organisms could\nbe assembled. Careful design could create organisms that might actually exist in\n&quot;symbiosis&quot; with other life.<p>> However, a UC also creates the tangible threat of a &quot;gray goo&quot; scenario: the\ndesign of an organism that is so evolutionarily advanced as to overwhelm the\ncurrent ecosystem...",1411692902
8370710,comment,8366749,8369444,1,0,ewzimm,,,"You might be right, but I have seen this trend before without mention that people tend to handle these things badly because of the environments they live in. Most people seem to have pretty poor training when it comes to probability, but the reason for this is presented as an evolutionary trait. I&#x27;m sure evolution plays a part, but I think it&#x27;s mostly in terms of initial, untrained states. When people talk about how people do things because they evolved to do them that way, it sounds like something insurmountable. Humans have been bad at probability for hundreds of thousands of years, so of course they are now. But people are constantly the victim of marketers trying to confuse them with numbers. The lottery is just one of many ways this happens. It&#x27;s no wonder that people are bad with numbers when there&#x27;s so much obvious manipulation to try to get people to make irrational purchases. This isn&#x27;t avoided by the article, but I feel like any mention of a trait people have inherited by evolution needs to be accompanied by an analysis of just how immutable it is. For example, desire for sex or food are pretty difficult to train out of, though not impossible. Poor aptitude with probability is pretty easily remedied. The fact is, not many organizations are motivated to fix it, and lots are more than willing to exploit it.",1411692901

It&#x27;s used for expressing structured geometry/geography primitives and performing calculations on them, as well as encoding/decoding them in the WKT/WKB (text and binary respectively) formats (the PostGIS &quot;geometry&quot; data type). All the geometry testing and manipulation functions, eg. ST_Intersects(), use GEOS.<p>GEOS actually comes with support for a spatial index called STR, or STRtree, but I believe it&#x27;s not used by PostGIS.

As a result, it fails the typical &quot;good startup idea&quot; test that SV applies.  It&#x27;s also at odds with this lecture series so far.<p>2) &quot;Stamina&quot; in this case means being able to throw yourself into something and work stupid hours fueled by ramen and passion until it&#x27;s built.  It <i>tends</i> to be a lot easier to do this when you&#x27;re younger than it is later in life.  The flip-side is that the &quot;35 year-old entrepreneurs&quot; you refer to are often able to work more steadily toward goals, but again this isn&#x27;t what SV looks for in hyper-growth startups eyeing a fast exit.<p>3) &quot;Distraction-free&quot; refers to being able to focus solely on your startup without having to split time with a family, or worry about making mortgage payments, or most importantly, being afraid of failing.  When you&#x27;re young it&#x27;s easy to take a hit and start over.  When you&#x27;re older and have large responsibilities it&#x27;s a lot more difficult.<p>Also to your earlier point, if your target market is HNIs, you&#x27;re probably not in the startup business because that&#x27;s a very small number of people to sell to.

3. Team<p>A. Co-Founders<p>-> Co-Founder relationships are among the most important in a company. #1 cause for early death: co-founder blowups.<p>-> Choosing a co-founder is a very important decision<p>-> Do not choose a random co-founder or someone who you&#x27;re not friends with.<p>-> YC batch where 9 startups choose a random co-founder and all 9 fell apart<p>-> A good way to meet a co-founder is in college. Next best thing is to work at an interesting company (e.g. Facebook/Google)<p>-> It&#x27;s better to have no co-founder than having a bad co-founder<p>-> Top 20 most valuable YC companies: all have at least 2 co-founders<p>-> &quot;Be relentlessly resourceful&quot; - look for this in potential co-founders. You need someone that behaves like James Bond. Smart, tough and calm<p>-> You really want a technical co-founder<p>-> Software companies should be started by software people. Not great non-technical managers.<p>-> 2 or 3 co-founders is ideal<p>B. Try not to hire<p>-> Try not to hire. It sucks to have a lot of employees (high burn-rate, complexity, tension, slow decision making, ...)<p>-> Be proud of what you can do what a small number of employees<p>-> In the early days, only hire when you desperately need to<p>C. Get the best people<p>-> AirBnB spent 5 months hiring before they hired a person. Brian Chesky: &quot;Would you take the job if you had a medical diagnosis that says you only have a year left to live?&quot; - culture of extremely dedicated people<p>-> Make sure everyone believes in your mission<p>-> Pick a company that&#x27;s already working, but that not everyone has noticed yet. Breakout trajectory.<p>-> Spend about 25% of your time hiring, once in hiring mode<p>-> &quot;Mediocre engineers do not build great companies&quot;. A few bad hires can kill your startup<p>-> Get person referrals to hire<p>-> Look outside of the valley<p>-> For most of the early hires, experience does not matter that much. Go for aptitude<p>-> Are they smart, do they get things done, do I wanna spend a lot of time around them?<p>-> Try to work together on a project, instead of doing a formal interview<p>-> Care about projects and focus on references<p>-> Look for good communication skills, manic determination, animal test and someone you&#x27;d feel comfortable reporting to if the roles were reversed (Mark Zuckerberg)<p>D. Keep the best people around<p>-> Aim to give 10% of the company to the first 10 employees. Vested over 4 years. If they&#x27;re successful, they&#x27;ll increase the company by way more than that<p>-> Fight with investors to reduce the amount of equity given. Be generous with employees<p>-> Don&#x27;t tell your employees they&#x27;re fucking up every day, cause they will leave.<p>-> Give your team all the credit for all the good stuff. Take responsibility for the bad stuff that happens.<p>-> Daniel Pink: &quot;Autonomy, mastery and purpose&quot;<p>E. Fire Fast<p>-> Fire fast. Everyone hopes that an employee will turn around.<p>-> How do you balance firing people fast and making employees feel secure? Everyone will screw up once, twice or more. You should be very loving, not take it out on them. If someone is getting every decision wrong, that&#x27;s when you need to act. It&#x27;ll be painfully aware to everyone.<p>-> When should co-founders decide on equity split? Not a discussion that gets easier with time. Set this very soon after you start working together.<p>-> How do you know if someone is not going to scale up to a role if they&#x27;re inexperienced? Smart people almost always will find a role within the company.<p>-> What happens when the relationship with your co-founder falls apart? Every co-founder (including yourself) has to have vesting. You pre-negotiate what happens when someone leaves. Normal is 4 years. Try to prevent dead weight.<p>-> What about co-founders not working in the same location? Don&#x27;t do it. Skeptical about remote teams in general. Communication and speed outweigh everything else. Video-conferencing and calls don&#x27;t work that well.<p>4. Execution<p>-> Being a founder means signing up for this years long grind on (good) execution. Everyone gets modeled after the founders. Work hard, be frugal, focus on customers, etc.<p>-> Only executing well is what adds/creates value<p>-> 5 jobs for a CEO: Set the vision, Raise money, Evangelize, Hire and manage, Make sure the entire company executes<p>-> 1. &quot;Can you figure out what to do?&quot; 2. &quot;Can you get it done?&quot;<p>-> Focus. One of the hard things about being a founder: 100 important things to do every day. A lot of things that look important do not matter. Identify the two or three most important things and do these. Say no a lot (97 out of 100 times).<p>-> Set overarching goals for the company. Everyone in the company should know these. These are the key goals. Repeat them. Put them up on the walls. Talk about them in meetings.<p>-> Communicate. You can&#x27;t be focused without great communication.<p>-> Meet every week. Focus on growth and momentum. Have to right metrics. Don&#x27;t let the company get distracted by other things. You can easily get excited by your own PR.<p>-> Be in the same space with your co-founder.<p>-> The secret to startup success is extreme focus and extreme dedication. Not the best choice for work/life balance. Outwork your competitors<p>-> Have a high execution speed. But be obsessed with quality at the same time. Focus on quality for everything you do (e.g. buying computers/gear).<p>-> Be biased towards action. &quot;I could do this great thing&quot;. Every time you talk to the best founders, they have done something new.<p>-> Do huge things in small incremental pieces. There&#x27;s almost always a way to break complexity down into smaller projects.<p>-> Be quick, do whatever it takes, show up a lot, don&#x27;t give up and be courageous.<p>-> &quot;When I was running my own company, we felt we were about to lose a deal. Critical deal for first customer in the space. We called them saying we had a better project/deal. We drove to the airport and showed up in person. We got to their office at 6am. They told us to go away. Junior guy wanted to meet. Then senior guy wanted to meet. Within a week, we had an agreement.&quot;<p>-> Always keep momentum in growth. It&#x27;s the lifeblood of startups. You want your company to be winning all the time. A winning team feels good and keeps winning.<p>-> If you lose momentum, most founders try to get it back in the wrong way (rally troops with speeches). You have to save the vision speeches for when you&#x27;re winning. Sales fixes everything in a startup. Figure out where you can get small wins.<p>-> Fights will break out when losing momentum.<p>-> When Facebook&#x27;s growth slowed down: Mark created a growth group. Small fixes got the curb pack up. Most prestigious group. One of Facebook&#x27;s best innovations that turned around the dynamic.<p>-> Ship product, launch new features, review metrics and milestones<p>-> Do not care about competitor noise in the press. Don&#x27;t worry about them at all until they&#x27;re beating you with a real shipped product.",1411691007

The cases found afterward are a different bug, and so far there&#x27;s no publicly known way to remotely exploit it. These other bugs were published to demonstrate that there are deeper flaws in bash&#x27;s parsing of environment variables.

Everyone has had times when they&#x27;ve worked long hours on something, and still felt great. Think about what was special in those situations. Ideas:<p>1) Play a sport.<p>2) Party hard, roughly 1 night per week, maybe Friday. This works well for many extremely hard working professionals in NYC. Not sure how well it would work in SV...<p>3) When coding, try to break up tasks into self-contained chunks that you can start and finish within one day. Accomplishing a new tangible goal each day can have a great mental effect. Catching up on big half-finished tasks from the previous day can be stressful and mentally draining.<p>4) Be around people you love being around. You&#x27;ll feel less stressed about escaping the office if the people you&#x27;re looking forward to being around are inside instead of outside the office.<p>5) Notice how it&#x27;s so hard to focus late into the evening at the office, but once you&#x27;re home you feel awake again and can work? For the earliest stage startup, consider making your work environment more like a home, or literally work out of your home with your cofounder. Your girlfriend/boyfriend may look down at you for doing this, get used to it. Partners hate startups.<p>6) Go for walks twice per day, preferably outdoors, in a place where you&#x27;re surrounded by lots of people - or alone in nature, whatever you feel like you&#x27;re missing.<p>7) Kick out whining people, immediately.",1411690315
