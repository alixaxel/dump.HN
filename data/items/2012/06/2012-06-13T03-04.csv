A second authentication that is much weaker than the first (prone to social engineering or even googling like the endemic first name of your favorite uncle questions) can be worse than just having one strong authentication. For some reason many companies think that building a bridge out of very many weak components makes a strong bridge. That is not true though, you have a weak bridge in the end.",1339559819

A policy that works well for me is that anything that will require more than 2 minor commits to accomplish should happen in a feature branch.

4104234,comment,4101965,4102458,1,0,jamesbritt,,,"I've written for Wrox (the first edition, the one that went bankrupt :))<p>When I was one of two co-authors of a book I don't recall being told to hit a specific page count, but there was a push for a certain degree of  ""thoroughness.""   This typically meant going into possibly tangential details to avoid sending someone off to another resource.  (Though if the other resources was another Wrox book then allowances we made.)<p>For example, in a book about XML (Pro VB 6 & XML[0]) there was a need to go through the XML specification.  A whole chapter.  I ended up using this as an opportunity to explain the spec and build some helper libraries that would make interacting with a DOM easier later on, so not a total loss, but it had a feeling of busy-work to me.<p>That was sort of a best-case scenario; two authors splitting book.  I also worked on assorted individual chapters for other books and there I had an incentive to bolster the word count because in some cases it affected the pay.<p>In my experience writing a single chapter meant either a flat amount or a per-word rate.  Writing multiple chapters opened up the option of royalties instead. I took royalties on the VB book and did OK.  Sadly this gave me a false impression of tech writing as a profession.<p>Many Wrox books were more a collection of padded chapters than coherent, well-planned, guides.  OTOH I think many people plunked down $40-50 just to get specific chapters that would get them past some problem.<p>[0]: As the Velvet Underground sang, ""Those were different times."" :)",1339559422
