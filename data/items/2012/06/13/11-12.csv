Marketing people need to keep up with marketing trends which in a tech startup environment means you now need to have technical knowledge to do this. Good marketers have always used metrics where they're available, and to call them 'growth hackers' implies that marketers don't know how to use metrics or that they're marketers who 'kludge stuff together to make it work'.<p>It debases hackers because what they're doing isn't really hacking per se, what they're doing is their job using tools in the way they were designed to be used (e.g. a/b tests etc.).<p>To me, this is like the way that words like geek and nerd have been hijacked by hipsters.

Or is it just an arbitrary name we give something we perceive, dependent entirely on our own language?  I do think that pure altruism is overrated though.<p>On some level I think to be successful at a business you have to think in some way you are making the world a better place.  You might not be doing that purely altruistically.  Indeed you are probably interested in money too.  But to be successful you have to think you are doing something cool that makes peoples lives better.<p>I think reciprocity is ultimately better than pure altruism for a couple of reasons.  First, if you expect to make a profit, you have a cushion to continue your work when things go downhill.  I have heard of not-for-profit magazines ceasing publication because of a lack of such a buffer and having to deal with unexpected expenses, for example.<p>Secondly interdependence is a good thing, and it is spiritually nourishing (I mean this not in the sense of supernatural but in the sense of one's mood and spirit).<p>Thirdly reciprocity helps ensure that the actions actually are being seen by others as valuable and worth supporting.

I read somewhere that VC's who invest in startup's actually lose money on average. The reason they're doing it in the first place is because they represent pension funds and similar who want a finger in 'that startup action' for diversity, with no one monitoring the eventual results closely enough (the consumers probably end up with +1-2% overall)<p>If point of capitalism is the efficient distribution of resources to the places they need to go then the VC's are actually doing a pretty bad job of it (on average)<p>At least with crowd sourcing it's a step in the right -direction- toward funding ideas that seem popular, that a bunch of consumers who invest would hopefully be doing so because they also want to use the product.<p>I'm sure there'll still be serial swindlers and greedy investors who get scammed, but in a utopian world it'd be great if it was sort of like Kickstarter, where you put in $50 with no guarantee of actually getting what you're funding, but now there's a chance you'll not only get that product, plus your money back, plus a nice little bonus sum if the company succeeds.
