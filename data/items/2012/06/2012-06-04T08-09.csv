4063182,comment,4061815,4063009,3,0,klodolph,,,"Fortunately, with a few simple coding guidelines you can avoid major pitfalls.<p>1. Always do bit operations on unsigned types.<p>2. Never overflow signed types.<p>3. Always shift less than the type width.  I can name architectures which implement large shifts in three distinct ways.<p>4. Know that most integers get promoted to int or unsigned, so you need an explicit cast to get 64 bits on most platforms.  So 1ULL << 48 is okay, 1U << 48 is bad.<p>5. Treat unsigned int / unsigned long as contagious, just like float and double.",1338799933

People just don't notice that as much if they have a single HD as that is usually active most of the time you are working. But with 2 HD's (typical SSD + HDD combination) you often have one HD sleeping and will run into this a lot more thereby. There's ways to work around it - putting the page file on the HD which is more active or not allowing the HD to sleep as often. But my favorite would still be to simply prevent Windows from even using the page-file before the memory is at least used up to 50% - which would nearly never happen on my system for example.",1338799882

On one side, you say that C isn't that complicated but on the other side you say you just use a small subset because you don't trust yourself and your colleagues to understand all the C quirks...<p>I think C is complicated with all the 191 undefined behaviors and 52 unspecified behaviors (source for these number is the paper that the author of the quiz wrote for specifying CSmith). One must master C before having absolutely knowledge that the code that he wrote doesn't fall into one of the two black-holes (undefined and unspecified behaviors). For instance, almost everyone that I ask, they tell me that dereferencing a NULL pointer yields 'Segmentation fault' but it's just not true. It's in fact undefined behavior.<p>The other thing is the rules for strict aliasing... It's pretty much impossible to convert one pointer to another without breaking some of the C rules. The experts say type punning is the way to go but type punning relies in another not defined behavior. Reading an element from an union that wasn't the last element written is undefined behavior.",1338799347

4063155,comment,4061815,4063103,2,0,klodolph,,,"For an example of signed overflow versus unsigned overflow, certain compilers are known to assume that int loop variables won't overflow.  So ""for (int i = 0; i != -1; ++i)"" is transformed into ""for (int i = 0; ; ++i)"", since both are equal in the eyes of the C standard (both will iterate through all non-negative values that fit in an int, then both will invoke undefined behavior, so they are the same).<p>The funny part is that it's often better to use int exactly because of the undefined behavior on overflow.  By signaling to the compiler that you don't intend to overflow a particular variable, it can optimize appropriately.",1338799259

Today they are large trees, I don't live in a area that you can describe as only where rich people stay. But you don't need to be rich to plant a tree and watch it grow. Its not like maintaining a garden. You don't have to spend a dime. And most trees don't require much maintenance(That is how they grow in the forest). So its not a rich man's thing by any measure.<p>Apart from the season of Autumn, where you need to broom out the leaves the tree has no other need to tending to. But the benefits are enormous. I go on the top of my home during the nights and its always cool in all seasons. There is always shade, early in the morning birds chirp and its very pleasant to hear that.<p>My home looks like an Oasis in the middle of an desert as there no trees around. Kids play under it, People like to stop for quick rest. Even from far things look green and fine.<p>Its only an excuse that rich people stray around green places. The fact is anybody can plant a tree. It doesn't take money to do it.",1338798092

Your adrenal gland is responsible for your adrenaline (duh) and gets triggered by the caffeine. So, it's not the caffeine that gives you a boost, but the adrenaline that gets released. Until it's gone, drought up, vanished. You can drink Red Bull till you die, but the adrenaline won't be there. Until you fix it.<p>You see, your body is a bank. A bank full of nutrient to be released when some other part of the body needs it. If you never make deposits, you won't get any interest either.
