It's like comparing a military aircraft carrier with a canoe, sure they both float on water but they're not even in the same league.<p>I've kept up with Ardour progress over the past 6 years and it has consistently gone nowhere while the major players innovate continuously. The assertion that Ardour has a chance at competing with the professional packages is absurd given that they've been promising basic MIDI support for years now, a feature that was present in software packages on the Atari. Add to that the fact that the project doesn't even have a roadmap for future development and it all looks pretty grim.<p>My previous career was audio engineering, and I can't help but laugh when the FOSS crowd insist that Ardour and Audacity are capable of replacing the industry leading software packages.",1338720475
4060495,comment,4060351,4060351,13,0,swombat,,,"I completely disagree with many points in this article.<p>There are a great many people out there who are very good at building stuff but utterly fail at ""being successful"". And conversely, there are people out there who suck at doing the stuff they're supposed to do but are very good at being successful. The two are orthogonal.<p>If you focus entirely on ""your craft"", whatever it may be, and ignore the skills that will enable you to deliver the resulting mastery to actual people (in particular sales and marketing, which most ""I just want to be really good at X"" people seem to think is beneath them), then you won't be successful. You'll just be one of those people who spends their life wondering why they were always penniless and couldn't get the things they wanted or have the impact they deserved to have even though they were really good.<p>The world is full of smart, competent people who don't know how to build their success, don't know how to market and sell themselves. Don't be one of those. Be a master - sure - but also learn how to translate that mastery into real success.<p>Re: mastery being more satisfying than success - that's only true if you're not broke. An empty belly, or the inability to afford even the most basic things you really want, makes mastery a hell of a lot less satisfying.",1338720467

Travelling to the US can be a nightmare - customs, TSA, metal detectors, body scanners, etc. As a tourist, I've never felt as unwelcomed as when travelling there.</i><p>That is mostly a small BS business that ends in, like, 15 minutes. Then you are in the US and you can start your travel.<p>I've visited the US six times, road-tripping for 40 days each time, and visited (more than once) all states but Vermont (just for lack of time, next time).<p>You can opt for a traditional holiday (i.e pick a place, like NY, Chicago, Miami, L.A, S.F etc) or have excellent road trips, or go explore huge natural parks.<p>In any case, you will find great city life, places untouched by tourism at all (e.g. I remember Langtry, TX, where the nearest shop  was like 50 miles away, or Avalon, MS, where only 2-3 blues buffs a year ever venture), and generally helpful and curious folk (with the occasional idiot).<p>Everywhere you go with a small drive you can find 99% of anything you want (just walk into the nearest Walmart for example), and you can find places to sleep ranging from $3000 a day hotels to $30 a day motels, with even the latter being just fine compared to shitholes you can get in other countries.<p>What I want to say is, this TSA/Airport business is an INSIGNIFICANT part of the trip. Act along with the security theater, and it is over in a few minutes.<p>In contrast, there are countries where you even have to bribe some officials to get in (or to avoid trouble).",1338719999

We eat lamb more than ""once a year"" (you probably refer to easter, but forget the mighty paidakia). Plus, this cow meat we mostly eat now is a recent development.<p>The traditional meat until 4-5 decades ago was lamb and goat (mostly because Greek domestic cows where too skinny and the grass unfit to support them. Post 1981 they were replaced with foreign cow breeds plus tons of imports).<p>As for hummus: ""Greek"" restaurants abroad are often mixed Greek/Middle-Eastern, and some are run by Lebanese and use the ""Greek"" just to attract some additional customers.<p>A funny aside: the traditional american ""diner"" (the chrome plated, hamburger joint etc) was more often than not, a Greek business. Greeks pwned the diner business in the US in the '40 to '80s. If you check a series like ""Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives"", a disproportionate percentage of iconic food joints are still in Greek hands, including the majority of NY hot dog stands.
