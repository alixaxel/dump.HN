This binary is/was actually a memory dump of the MFC application, a serialisation on FAT block-based file.<p>Newer formats are complex, because they are almost an automatic transliteration to XML tags to keep backwards compatibility with the status quo. All this means, that it is highly not trivial to read Office formats without being 100% compatible with MFC. Which is not 100% possible -- even for MS itself ...let alone others (ie. competitors). This becomes apparent, when you try to insert a page, paragraph with copy paste into an existing document within Word: sometimes fitting into the existing OO hierarchy will inevitably fail.

I am the original author of Photon and today PHP is extremely robust and you can catch all the exceptions/errors (outside the ones which are making your code invalid, but hey, do your homework). The current PHP 5.3 is also wonderful at not leaking memory. So you get the speed of bare PHP with a framework (because nothing is reloaded, the framework can really load once, reuse many times).<p>On a small system, a standard HTTP request through Mongrel2, to the framework and back is about 2ms (including 1ms of network latency between the hosts, data from my production monitoring). This is the ""hello world"" latency. It makes using PHP very fun and very fast. Also, a single PHP process running in the background uses about 12MB, it means that with 12MBx3 + 10MB Mongrel2, you can serve 1000's of users with nearly no load on your system (if you push the load only when needed at the DB level). Tracing a PHP process, you can run it without system calls at all (only gettimeoftheday for logging).<p>But, this is cutting edge, so, you need to be open minded and ready to dig in the code (less than 25k SLOC anyway I think).",1338975315

Steel has good thermal conductivity, and therefore steel structures start to bend greatly when temperature hits 600C in a single floor. This usually causes a collapse. It's very important to quickly evacuate steel building if it's on fire.<p>With massive wood structures the situation is different. The wood is very good heat insulator, so if the skin gets to 1000C the inside might still be lot less than 250C. Wood doesn't burn that quickly as it has to evaporate first (we usually call this smoke) before it can burn.<p>Of course this is all dependent of scale.

Children like computers for youtube, facebook, etc. They have no inhibitions about technology and don't think it's OK to be clueless. The staff I work with divide into those who use computers all day, every day, and those who only do it occasionally and reluctantly. They tend to take up undue amounts of my time asking for support with trivial things, and I have on occasion been shouted at, whined at by email, screamed at from a distance of a couple of feet, and emotionally blackmailed by a teacher who would break down into tears if I didn't fix her problems immediately. But all the people who do stuff like that (i.e. show extreme discomfort with technology and take it out in inappropriate ways) just love iPads and iPhones. It takes all the crap out of the situation, and it (perhaps most importantly) takes me out of it - I think they feel less dependent when they can install their own apps, etc. The things I dislike about the iPad are what they like most.<p>I think they discover Dropbox via the iPad rather than via the PC. I don't tell them about it because it can be a bit confusing explaining how it works. But there is no confusion if they find out (for themselves) that it syncs their iPad to their PC and vice versa. Solves a very immediate problem in a hassle-free way.<p>I'm sure there are plenty of problems waiting to be solved in eduation. For example, multiple logins - to Moodle, Google Docs/Gmail, various other websites. Would love to see an app which sits in the tray and aggregates all these logins so a student can click to say ""log me into <i>everything</i>"" without ever typing a password except to get into Windows in the first place. (There's not much of a security issue with keeping all these logins in a central database since it's not that sort of login; just a way to play educational games or whatever.) Other things would include ways to get iPads out of the classroom. For example, some of our staff use them to film/photograph students playing sports so they can check their posture. For cricket, for example, it can be very difficult to prove to someone that their arm is bent at the point of delivery (which is a ""no ball""). The iPad removes all and any doubt by showing the bowler a movie of his ""action"". Also, field science, etc - counting how many bugs are in a square meter of grassy ground, using image recognition to look up insects in a DB and say ""That's a wood wasp"" with a link to Wikipedia, etc.<p>You did ask ;) I'm sure you could find hundreds of things to do if you're looking for a project.",1338974113

The Audio Home Recording Act of 1992, the same legislation that put these levies into place, also protected the rights of individuals to make non-commercial copies of copyrighted works. At least that's my read on it, though I am not a lawyer.<p>All of the comments here seem vehemently opposed to the levy mentioned in the article but if it came with an extension of our rights to non-commercially copy and share works then I think that it would be a very fair trade. I would even be relatively unopposed if this was applied to bandwidth usage. Technologically speaking, there's no reason that a person shouldn't be able to go online and check out almost any song, movie, book, or television show in existence. Many, many people are aware of this and with good reason feel that it should be the case. The barrier to this is in the quagmire of licensing that is exemplified by what we've seen go on with Showtime, HBO, and Netflix.<p>Imagine if the government would stand up and say that universal access to art, literature, and educational materials is important enough that the laws need to be changed to facilitate it. If non-commercial exchange of copyrighted materials was legalized but in exchange bandwidth was taxed and the money paid out as royalties to rights holders based on torrent activity or something of the sort.

If a top VC invests in the seed round and then passes on the A, other VCs will have difficulty overlooking that the smartest money that knows the company the best isnt following on.""<p>One of the VCs were are talking to is very high profile, and they also seem to be the most interested. It would be a dream to have them invest, but the more I read on the subject, the more potentially harmful it sounds.<p>If we raised enough to expand here, it would be like the VC buying an option, with a higher chance of them not following on. Chris seems to say that > $500k is still an investment, so less of a problem, but perhaps still not enough to make the next step.<p>So, raise a small amount and expand here but risk them not following on, raise as much as possible from them and try to make a move to the US work on a relative shoestring, or potentially turn down a huge VC and start again when we are truly ready for series A?
