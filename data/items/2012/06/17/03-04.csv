In a very clear sense, the transformative with regard to art lies in changing it's meaning.\nHowever, this can be a very subtle thing. And it may be that the subtlety is not realised or played out in the way the artist intends, or in the way that the viewer receives it. This could then boil down to a matter of quality, or strength.\nIt is not even that simple. If Duchamp's early forays into 'readymades' had been slapped with lawsuits, we may never have had 'the fountain'.",1339905244

Good to see my idea has some scientific backing :).<p>I personally am in a particularly odd position: I learned Russian first but still learned English at a very young age (5) and have since used it more. I'm not entirely certain how this has affected my view of blue, but I think I see it more like English speakers (e.g. not differentiating between the two blues intuitively) than Russian speakers. This probably says something about my relative comfort in the two languages.<p>Another interesting thing is that for the longest time I did not even realize that the difference was so fundamental. I just took it in stride. When I thought about it, it was a little weird: there is actually a different set of <i>colors</i> (rather than just shades of color) in the two languages.

Too many false positives (posts that shouldn't be modded but are, resulting comments like saurik's above, and entire threads complaining this problem).<p>5.  Too many false negatives  that slip through anyway.<p>And of course, not part of the mod system, but too many submitters just don't know how to descriptively, accurately, concretely title submissions anyway, increasing the volume a seemingly too-small group of mods has to deal with.<p>HN isn't the first social media site to have problems like this, but most others have a full-time dev team working on solving them, and they evolve certain solutions like Slashdot's meta-moderation or Reddit's user-run/modded subreddits.<p>So I don't think the mod system in its current form can scale with those problems, but on a more meta level I'm not sure that PG can scale as the developer of the mod system, given that YC takes 110% of his time.<p>Just trying to identify the problem before attempting to solve it, any thoughts?",1339903795

4122128,comment,4121729,4121729,3,0,makecheck,,,"I think the article's explanations for button-ordering are good but I wish their examples didn't violate other dialog design principles in the process.<p>One mistake their examples make is to include an ""X"" (close) button in dialogs that contain button choices.  The ""X"" action is ambiguous in dialogs and is especially bad if all actions are equally probable (e.g. ""Don't Save"", ""Cancel"" and ""Save"" all seem likely to map to ""X"").  GUI toolkits don't seem to force any consistent interpretation of ""X"", and in fact the programmer might forget to wire up the ""X"" to any action at all.  It's preferable for the ""X"" button to not be there so that the user can focus on the action buttons.<p>Another (admittedly minor) issue is the spelling ""Ok"".  It's not pronounced ""awk"" or ""oke""; it's both spelled and pronounced ""OK"".  It <i>does</i> have a whole-word form and that word is ""Okay"".  So it can either be ""OK"" or ""Okay"" but it should not be ""Ok"".  In dialogs it is very conventional to use the short form of ""OK"".",1339903690

4122121,comment,4121859,4121859,5,0,cup,,,"This is interesting because in Arabic colours are presented very differently than in English. I'm not sure about other languages but in Arabic colours are a bit more ""looser"" for lack of a better term. There are more shades of red for instance because Arabs were used to different shades of red in their horses and deserts. The colours are less defined for instance ""the colour between red and brown"" (as many horses are) or ""the colour of ash"" are used instead of ""the colour red / grey"". Colours also have properties and traits which define them (some colours are strong or thick and others are weak).<p>Perhaps any HN Arabic grammarians might be able to discuss this further.",1339903466

Daniel Defoe, Jonathan Swift, John Dryden, Jane Austen and so on were hardly writing in ""American English."" In fact the non-ly adverb is a relic of Anglo-Saxon declension and is present in all modern Englishes, much like the few remaining English accusatives (""him,"" ""her,"" ""them"", etc.).<p>Contrary to the comment above, ""awful curious"" isn't incorrect usage. It's only ambiguous if you start from the assumption of an error (missing punctuation, missing conjunction, or missing -ly).<p>English is rich with similar constructions that are widely mistaken for errors due to prescriptions in basic style guides, which is about as far as most folks' knowledge of the language extends. Another common one is the comma splice, which isn't an error as long as you know to call it <i>asyndeton</i> or <i>parataxis</i>.",1339903214
