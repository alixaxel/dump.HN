I'd also add a book on marketing metrics; an Amazon search will bring up a number of them, all fairly similar. If you are interested in specific advertising tactics, I'd start with a book about writing direct-response copy because that's the most replicable and hence useful knowledge.",1339048768

Of your examples, all of them use stock widgets, except for the last two.<p>In the last two they replaced stock controls with custom ones, even where they didn't have to, and that supports your hypothesis.<p>But all of the others, however, are using stock controls for all the controls where there is a stock control, and only using custom controls where there is no stock control.<p>The ability to customize the stock controls has increased a fair bit and gotten more popular as its gotten easier.  But these developers (at least, I can't speak for the whole appstore) are using the standard controls.<p>What is true is that they aren't using the blue-pinstripe look of the original iPhone anymore.<p>The reason this distinction is important is that its a whole lot harder to do a custom control (like a turntable) than it is to use a standard control, and its also very easy to take that standard control and make it just the right shade of grey, or make it look like wood, etc.<p>Thus customizing how these standard controls <i>look</i> has gone up dramatically, yes.",1339047896

When you have enough FU money, you can indulge a really skewed view of the world (former Intel exec comes to mind).  And this series of lectures illustrates Theil's.  He thinks someone, a young and naive (pre-university) prodigy, is going to make him a wealtier VC by sharing with him their ""secret"" idea.  He criticizes education and America's lack of meaningful innovation, yet he's made wealthy by vacuous ideas of ""innovation"" like Facebook.  Then look at what he's contributed in the way of innovation.  What are his qualifications as an ""expert""?  An online payments company and a company that analyzes data from the web to try to find ""terrorists"".  This is innovation?  We should hope his program participants will aspire to do better.<p>In his last lecture on biotech where he talks about a panel of VC making predictions about the future.  Were any of these VC actually in the biotech sector?  As long as they have lots of capital under their direction, does it matter?<p>When you are wealthy people will listen to you, no matter what you say.  Alas, it may encourage the speaker to believe their own hype even more.  Thiel is taking full advantage of this privilege.",1339047804

And mostly actually a framework which is as opinionated and feature rich as possible. These frameworks don't grow randomly; they are based on actual needs. When they are young they answer mostly to acute needs of the developer, when they grow they automatically grow into stuff 'most companies' need. And that's 'your company' as well; you can think you are different, but that's not really true. If you try to be different, you mostly do a lot of work which you shouldn't have. Yes, there is Google. Yes there is Facebook. But you are not those. And you won't become those. Also most companies are not IT companies; non-IT companies benefit even more from frameworks and rigidity; in most cases it's better to remake or form your business process to the framework/software than the other way around. Other people did that heavy lifting already; why should you try to do that again?<p>I'm not sure where you work, but this is my experience from using 'wysiwyg' clipper & dbase software in the 80s to Delphi frameworks in the 90s to web frameworks.

You have the brains, the skills, and the YOUTH to do whatever you want! DO IT! It doesn't have to be a startup, but it should be something that you really really want to do and would do even for free. You literally have nothing to lose.<p>If you think you would work for someone else for free - then do it. The minute you take a job for the pay however, you're on the slippery slope of selling your soul for money.<p>You can always make money. Your youth is ticking away by the minute. You will never get it back.<p>I graduate from CMU 6 years ago. I took the safer route. Instead of searching for something I am passionate about, I settled for the paycheck. It took me 4 years to gather up enough courage to admit that I was miserable on the paycheck treadmill.<p>See, when you work for a paycheck, you sell yourself to the person in control of your pay - your manager. Your incentive is to please your manager so that you can get your raise. Often times, this means that you have to compromise your own judgement to be in alignment with the management. Each time you compromise your own judgement, you actually become more adversed to making your own judgement. And as you lose your sense of judgement, you lose your confidence in yourself to do any differently. This is when you are really in trouble. You become risk adverse: the more you compromise your soul to gain your material belongings, the more you become committed to holding on to your material goods for dear life.<p>I saw this happening to myself but I didn't have enough courage to just quit outright, so I took the only other socially (parentally) acceptable route: go back to school.<p>At my MBA program I found a whole collection of folks similar to me. Regardless of whatever we wrote on the application to get in, most of us were just soul searching. Searching for the meaning of our lives beyond our paychecks. There, I observed a phenomenon. The I want to do something else BUT disease. Usually, the BUT is a but I have sustain my materialistic life. So even as most of us were soul searching, by far the majority went right back onto the paycheck treadmill. And that is sad. Really sad.<p>Avoid the treadmill altogether and you will be happier for it. If you cant, if you need the money to sustain yourself and your family, then at the very least keep your conciseness in check and remember that youre just working for a paycheck. In your spare time, do what you truly want to be doing, challenge yourself and dont listen to what the majority wants you to do. Be different. You only live once. Live it.",1339046145

It was just an example)<p>Wow, that 'autoescaping the commands in parens' syntax is great.  But it doesn't seem to be list related.  For example: grep pattern (echo ""foo.txt"") just passes the result from the echo to grep.  It's grep which is doing the right thing with a list, right?  Still this is interesting.  So fish stuff isn't necessarily written left to right and joined with pipes, instead it's written in nested form like in a more modern langauge.<p>Alas you still need to use the ""find | grep"" technique in fish because of the argument size limit.  For example:<p><pre><code>    grep pattern (find .)
</code></pre>
results in:<p><i>Failed to execute process '/usr/bin/grep'. Reason:
The total size of the argument and environment lists 34kB exceeds the operating system limit of 34kB.
Try running the command again with fewer arguments.</i><p>The equivalent in bash gives you:<p><i>-bash: /usr/bin/grep: Argument list too long</i>",1339045880
