4152548,comment,4151688,4151688,4,0,comex,,,"The only difference between strcpy_s and strlcpy, other than taking arguments in a different order and being more annoying to type, is that if an overflow would occur, it sets destination[0] to 0 rather than truncating.  This is probably an improvement, since truncation can cause security problems if you're building filenames and such (though, should you fail the test accidentally, I suspect it's much harder to track down why a string somewhere in your app became empty than why it was truncated)... but is it really worth switching to yet another string copy function?<p>(well, from a BSD perspective.  Apparently strcpy_s has been around on Windows since Windows 95.)",1340510326

There is a reason that HP (and most other vendors) have different models with different starting prices, and it has very little to do with base specs.<p>The DV6t has such a low starting price because it isn't built well, simple as that. I don't care if you put a screaming fast CPU in it and the highest quality screen possible. It still has shit build quality. It is still built like a $800 dollar laptop.",1340510129

Not because the providers <i>have</i> to satisfy our sense of entitlement, but because they <i>do</i>, because that's what it takes to compete until at some point that's what's expected just to play the game.  Food providers at some point stopped competing on food safety because everyone demanded everything be safe.  We started expecting cars to be very reliable, and if someone makes an unreliable car then fuck caveat emptor, it's not going to become a matter of whether some consumers are willing to make that compromise and some are not  instead your brand becomes shit and you have to beg people to come back, if you can at all.  Right now we don't have that expectation about APIs; but some people want us to, we are moving that direction, and <i>maybe</i> we will get there.  Or maybe we'll get somewhere else; progress however ensures that we will get <i>somewhere</i>, that consumers will find something new about which to feel entitled.<p>And yeah, these companies don't ""owe"" us anything, but consumers (even the subset of developer-consumers) can still get pissed off at them and say shit and that's the fucking market.  And maybe it won't mean anything, maybe it'll all fade away... and maybe it won't.  That's the risk those brands are taking.  It's our market-based prerogative to bitch about whatever the hell we want to bitch about, using whatever hyperbole we want, with any sense of entitlement that we've acquired.<p>If someone starts sending mail bombs to these companies because they aren't tending their APIs as we'd like, then that's coercion.  But there's no coercion here, this is just people offering their opinions.  So quit yer whining about our whining, the internet has entitled us to whine as much as we fucking want to, and has offered market-based ways to lift or bury that whining.",1340509106
