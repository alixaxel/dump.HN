4089830,comment,4088572,4088835,1,0,marshray,,,"Yes, that came to everyone's mind. But what was the big title game involving a sword for Wii? Zelda Twilight Princess.<p>Originally designed for the Gamecube, it was ported to Wii with few changes. Basically, you wave the Wiimote left and right to simulate button 'A' and poke it forward to simulate a different button combination from the conventional Gamecube controller.<p>Having been a big fan of the game on Gamecube, I didn't like the Wii version very much. Most of the time your sword is used to cut grass or break pottery or something else mundane, so it felt like a lot of waving around just for show. Maybe even a little bit like having a TV remote with loose batteries that you have to shake a bit to get it to work.<p>Years ago I practiced a little martial arts and took 3 or 4 classes dedicated to practice swords. What I can relate from that is that picking up a sword-like object and waving it around purposefully for an hour is going to use muscles that you are not used to using. Even someone in good shape is going to feel it the next day.<p>This sounds like good fun exercise, but it seems like the market for a video game you can play from the couch will always be much larger than for a game that presents a realistic physical challenge.<p>Wii and Kinect games may provide interesting counterexamples; we should look up the sales stats for physical vs. sedentary games.",1339289935

In conjunction with computer based topology optimisation (using simulations to find the absolute optimum 3D shape for a component), 3D printing will allow us to produce really, really light components. CNC mills are quite limited by tool paths, something which doesn't impact 3D printing at all.<p>There's also a huge amount of potential in advanced materials. Titanium is really, really hard to machine and also very expensive (lots of wastage = lots of cost). 3D printing titanium (with lasers for sintering) is much easier (although quite slow) and can lead to very low material wastage.<p>It probably isn't going to change an average persons living room in the next 20 years. It will change (in some cases significantly) the design of lightweight components on aircraft and other weight critical applications.",1339289803

4089768,comment,4053076,4053076,1,0,urlwolf,,,"Berlin (Germany), CTO/ lead developer<p>We are a funded (seed) startup working on a customer analytics tool for online retailers.We are two people looking for a head of development / CTO. We have offices in Berlin, funding for one year and the package includes very generous shares for the right candidate. We use lean startup methods, and can systematically test hypotheses on any market. Hundreds of customer interviews already done. Our approach is the startup of startups, that is, iterate fast and discard what doesnt work, even if the new product looks like a completely new application (and startup!).<p>What we do:<p>-----------<p>Customer Lifefitime Value (CLV) is the mythical magic number, the amount of money a particular customer will ever bring in. Knowing your CLV makes it trivial to:\n- optimize marketing spend for different inbound channels.\n- identify your highest value customers, \n- identify those in danger of never coming back.<p>Most shops have a gut feeling of what their CLV is, but no way of knowing for sure. Yet this is the number that would make the largest impact to their bottom line, if only it was possible to have it. Ah! Predicting the future is hard, right?<p>It turns out CLV can be computed with surprising accuracy (10% error) at the individual level. At Fluidshopping, we use sophisticated bayesian models to estimate CLV. We look beyond what has happened in the past (which you get with say google analytics). CLV changes often, due to your marketing actions, season, or changes in the market. We retrain our models weekly to reflect those changes, and then suggest the actions that would make the largest impact (email campaigns, popups with offers triggered by user behavior on your site, etc).<p>Requirements:<p>-------------<p>You can apply with any language. But we need code samples. Let us see something you build; please explain what it does and how to run it if its not obvious. We prefer github projects. Do not send code samples that do not make sense out of context. We are looking for a difficult problem you solved, or a common problem that you solved in a novel way.<p>You need to be within 5 years of your last academic appointment, or graduation. That is, if you graduated from university more than 5 years ago, you are not eligible. You can also apply if you had a job in research settings within the last 5 years. We do not care about you having a title, but we are funded by the government, and they do. They want to see someone with a compSci-related title. We are really sorry in advance if the requirement excludes you, a great hacker who doesnt have a title.<p>Responsibilities:<p>-----------------<p>Your responsibilities will be to work on new key features, help us scale, contribute to the product and optimize performance. Youll be the CTO in an agile development environment. Customer interviews tell us our solution attacks a very obvious pain point for online retailers, a large market that is ripe for disruption. As a CTO, you will make decisions to make sure our solution just works for clients. We have excellent talent for both front-end and back-end development, so you are free to concentrate on the problems that matter most (architecture, models, etc).
