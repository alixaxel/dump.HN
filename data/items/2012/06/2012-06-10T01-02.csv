4089942,comment,4080268,4088113,1,0,temphn,,,"Hmmm. Didn't Boltzmann put S = k \log \Omega on his grave? I think we are taking different lessons from stat mech. To me, the triumph of stat mech is that macroscopic phenomena (like entropy S) can be explained in terms of microscopic quantities (like Omega).<p>At least with S, even before stat mech there was a precise process to measure S from a P/T phase diagram. And there was a procedure to reproduce a phase diagram for an arbitrary compound.<p>Yet have you ever seen someone calculate the values of C, I, G, and Y from raw data? Like, a reproducible research document which calculates these from a public database of individual transactions, perhaps from a virtual economy? Everyone starts from government statistics to justify the government's activities.<p>You can directly measure the macroscopic quantity of inflation on a microscopic basis by simply tracking prices over time. But the other quantities that a lot of macro reasoning seems to be based on do not have simple measurements. That is the fundamental reason for deep skepticism about macro. Where's the raw data and the source?<p>Because we are making decisions about trillions of dollars by verbal argument rather than open public datasets and source code. Given a database with an anonymized, representative sample of tax returns, credit card transactions, bank account deposites, new company incorporations and the like (many of which would be a matter of public record) you could probably go pretty far with some basic scatterplots. Yet this is not the culture in economics.",1339293511

Should've been wiser to just copy+paste a dead comment. Still, this is stupid.<p>- points by microarchitect<p>I'm glad you brought this up. I suspect that someone is going to pipe up and say we need more than ""just anecdotal evidence"" or something similar. On the face of it, this would seem like a reasonable reply.
Except, I remember when PG said something bizarre about writing being a more important skill than speaking based on his anecdotal experiences of listening to good presenters (!) and everybody here loved it. Certainly nobody asked for data and the most upvoted comments weren't critical of the article.<p>Pretty much the same thing happened when patio11 wrote a huge document with ""advice"" for young engineers which as far as I could make out, were based on little more than his experiences making a few bucks selling software on the internet. He too had bizarre advice; for instance, don't go to graduate school. I'll be the first to admit that I don't know if this is good or bad advice. But, even if you buy into the premise of many HNers that anything other than a billion-dollar ""exit"" is a failure, going to grad school certainly worked out well for Sergei and Larry. Again, I don't remember any comments asking for data supporting patio11's assertions. Everybody just lapped it up.<p>Now I'm not trying to diss either PG or patio11. These guys have been ""successful"" and perhaps what they have to say could be useful to others here. That said, I've been watching threads on gender issues on HN for about two years now, and I definitely believe that these articles are held to different standards than all the other articles here.
I also see highly upvoted ragingly misogynistic articles. I remember one by a east-european developer literally saying that he would never hire women because they could potentially get pregnant (you can't make this shit up!). I'm sad to say nobody asked for data in that instance either and instead circlejerked about how women are not cut out for the startup lifestyle.<p>Sorry about the long rant, but I'll conclude by saying that it was these startling examples of misogyny and sexism over here that make me reluctant to comment any more. I actually want to delete my account but it turns out you need to e-mail PG for this and even then your comments won't be deleted. If I'd known about this when I signed up, I would never have made an account.",1339293358

Unfortunately, the current state of the art for CF treatment in the US suggests a ""high fat, high salt, high calorie"" diet. This results in medical teams actively encouraging a junk food diet.<p>My oldest son also has CF. When he lost five pounds, his clinic treated it like a crisis and at their encouragement I put a big bowl of chocolates and other crap on the coffee table and encouraged him to snack. After he gained back about 2.5 pounds and his clinic got off our backs and quit sounding like they might report me to social services if he didn't gain weight to their satisfaction, we returned home and he promptly handed me the bowl and announced ""We are <i>never</i> doing this again.

They were once suburbs but are now part of LA the city for all intents and purposes. It's not like New York or Chicago where the vast majority of the city is one legal unit. There are also weird quasi-cities like North Hollywood, which is technically just a neighborhood but is really an entirely distinct municipal entity, and is only a few pieces of paperwork away from becoming so under the law as well.<p>A taxi company has to be licensed on a per-city basis and multiple-city licenses are basically unheard of. You can take your passenger to a city you're not licensed in, but if you <i>pick up</i> a passenger in a city you're not licensed in, you could pay thousands in fees and get shut down for 30 days or more. Since just about every neighborhood in Los Angeles is technically an independent municipality, this basically means it's legally impossible to hail a cab.

Well, sure, but there can be no obligation to do that which cannot be done.

Going off what Marvin asked below, I think that we're seeing the democratization of prototyping / dev tools: 3D printing is a part, but so is TechShop, Maker movement, etc. - however the next thing still to come is the democratization of production.<p>Solving manufacturing is a much larger problem than a one processes panacea. The real revolution should be framed as ""digital manufacturing"" - this is making the production process open and connected. 3D printing is sort of the gateway drug as I see it for the automation / accessibility of most every manufacturing process.<p>3D printing specifically, we're hitting some material science / engineering problems that are far harder than what's being done in making the RepRap clones. 3D printing has largely the same range of materials as it did 15 years ago - none of them are close to being as good as even low grade injection molded plastic. Instead, why not digitize / automate the rest of the 100's of processes (like milling, injection molding, etc.) - software will always be faster to develop than material science issues that we're hitting.<p>Disclosure: I was the founder of a 3D printing company, CloudFab, and I work with various advanced manufacturing tech.",1339291391
