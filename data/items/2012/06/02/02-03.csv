It's a strong red flag that they're just licensing content without any understand of the actual content matter and the quality of what they're teaching. I could be wrong, but that's definitely the impression I get based on both the fact that they're using Java and the classes are structured like traditional university classes, since not only are most university classes really mediocre (at best), but it also shows that they aren't taking advantage of the power of the platform/medium.

The first 10 stories that I see through the graph api correspond to about the first 100 stories I see through my facebook newsfeed (this same limitation also applies to using facebook's own ""download your data"" app, as it is implemented through the graph api without any special access).   This also means that if you post a comment to friend's story (and see on your page/timeline ""commented on X..."", if that friend restricted api access to their data, you will not only not be able to access the comment (that you wrote), you won't even see it in json dump of the page via the graph api.<p>In all honesty, the only way to do it ""right"" (in quotes for a reason, as not really right(tm), and with facebook's current limitations) is to basically parse their dom and rewrite it.  That's also something I've experimented with (and have a relatively simple implementation), however, they change things constantly!",1338602506
