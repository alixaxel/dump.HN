4135550,comment,4134729,4134729,4,0,mkramlich,,,"This video reminds me of another of Elon's strengths, beyond just a technical mind and an entrepreneurial mind: he's very well-spoken, and he's very charismatic -- and it comes off as very natural, so it helps to close the gap with his audience whenever he speaks. He doesn't come off as some egghead academic or engineer -- though clearly he can think like one. Instead he talks like he's a friend speaking casually and calmly, off-the-cuff, with a mixture of what you might call British-style humility. But backed by confidence and a sense of persistance. One of his repeated phrases across many interviews is that he's determined to make X thing happen, and he's confident he can, that they can. If they can't make something happen the first time perfectly out of the gate, then they'll learn, adjust and try again until they do.<p>He probably has a one-in-a-million combination of both a strong technical mind, a strong business sense, and strong personal charisma. There are a ton of folks out there that have maybe one of those things, and rarely two, but it's extremely hard to find all three. Plus he scored big early with Zip2 and PayPal. Arguably this fourth thing -- a huge war chest to draw from, beginning in the late 90's or so -- has made him even more rare. Indeed, a Tony Stark of his age.",1340164741

Second best would be have a well defined deprecation period with appropriate warnings to developers, which they also  failed to do according to jwz, or did properly in OpenGL 2.0 according to you.

Then you can put your server in there for free and connect up.<p>Point is, for as ""little"" as $1750/mo, you could do this yourself by colocating with the ADSCP.<p>Alternatively, one could offer a multiplexed connection to AWS via an ADSCP, then route the traffic from within Amazon.<p>Bottom line, the fixed costs for doing this probably higher than justified for most people with a single server.<p>This analysis does not include the per-hour AWS Direct Connet costs, which are marginally fixed per usage without regards to infrastructure scale.<p>-alan",1340163253

Every faculty member involved in some sort of administration that I know (both parents, multiple family friends, and people I have had courses for and work for) were in favor of Sullivan's proposed changes:  anyone who has spent time around a University can imagine how hard it is to get that level of buy-in from the professors.  (Hint: imagine herding irritable, opinionated, and very, very smart cats that are often impossible to fire. Then imagine that some of them have large bullhorns and are willing to write for Slate if they disagree with you, like Siva Vaidhyanathan here: <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_minute/2012/06/teresa_sullivan_fired_from_uva_what_happens_when_universities_are_run_by_robber_barons_.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hey_wait_a_m...</a>\nPoint being, it is hard to get consensus, and I might be understating that.)<p>The main objection that I and most people I've talked to have is that the BOV hasn't given a good reason for its actions. It may very well be that Sullivan deserved to be fired. It may very well be that there needed to be more drastic changes than she was willing to make (although for an appropriate idea of how hard drastic, top down change is at a top University, see my description of faculty consensus above). But without releasing any concrete reason, backed up by publicly available data, and by essentially saying ""shut up and trust our judgment"", they showed a fundamental disconnect between their idea of acceptable governance and the rest of the university's idea of acceptable governance. For the record, I think that if you look at them as the board of a corporation replacing a CEO, their actions are totally reasonable (and I wouldn't be surprised if this was, in part, how they viewed themselves; this doesn't really say much for their case, though, because that still shows a massive cultural disconnect between them and the university body).",1340161537
4135433,comment,4132730,4134872,8,0,choxi,,,"I'd really love to write up a blog about this, but I'll do my best to summarize my thoughts here:<p>It's a legitimate question. Empirically, it seems like it is possible since DevBootcamp in SF has been able to do it and 88% of their students were qualified enough to obtain jobs as Rails developers. I think that's a pretty fair metric to go by.<p>Our bootcamp is not as much of a time commitment as DevBootcamp, but I think more than half of the battle of learning a new domain is minimizing the space of ""things you don't know you don't know"". I think that's a much more reasonable goal, after which it's a lot easier to direct your own learning because you've gotten through the steepest parts of the learning curve.<p>For example, if you never had any concept of a database, it'd be really hard to learn more about them. Someone new to web development and programming probably has no concept of databases being separate from code. If they wanted to have ""users"" in their application, they probably wouldn't even know how to formulate a question to ask Google. Would they ask ""how do I store users in an app?"" No, because they probably don't have any concept of ""storage"" in an app. Or maybe they do but they pick the wrong word and ask ""how do I save users in an app?"". ""save"" and ""store"" are almost synonymous in a general context, but Google will give you drastically different results because they have different idiomatic meanings in a web development context. In any case, neither of those queries will get you what you want from Google (which is, to discover what a ""database"" is).<p>I guess my point is that the goal for us at Bloc isn't to cram your brain with enough knowledge for you to call yourself a Rails hacker -- it's to get you through the steep part of the learning curve and give you a large enough view of the landscape of web development for you to continue learning afterword.",1340161530
