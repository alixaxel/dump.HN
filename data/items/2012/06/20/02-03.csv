Every single Palestinian is treated like a terrorist--children, old people, families. When the soldiers decide to close the gates, no one gets in or out.<p>I was there for three weeks. It's the world's largest prison. And it's funded by U.S. tax dollars and people who invest in the ""Jewish"" state. The expansion of Israeli settlements continue as more and more Palestinian land is confiscated for this technical reason or that.<p>Israel should be treated as a pariah until they end the occupation and give one person one vote instead of treating an entire population like prisoners.",1340161155
4135417,comment,4135354,4135354,1,0,pbsd,,,"Impressive computation, but not much new here. The problem solved was a discrete logarithm over the finite field GF(3^(97*6)), which is known to be ""easy"" due to the low complexity of the function field sieve, asymptotically similar to the special number field sieve used to break 1039-bit integers a few years back (eprint.iacr.org/2007/205).<p>This is relevant because pairing-based cryptosystems require that logarithms be difficult to solve both in the elliptic curve groups (in this case E(GF(3^97))), and in the finite field groups that result from pairing evaluations. What failed here was the latter, due to the function field sieve.<p>There aren't many details on this computation, but you can get a good hint of how this was done by the previous paper of the same group (676 bits last time): <a href=""http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/090"" rel=""nofollow"">http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/090</a><p>TL;DR Don't use low embedding degrees for pairing-based crypto, and you'll be fine.",1340161090

Intel 945GM).<p>Fixed function is easy to make safe, and offers a path to leverage 3d acceleration on these platforms that cannot be beaten in software.

4135411,comment,4135116,4135391,3,0,mc32,,,"I'm inclined to think that regardless of the actor responsible for this, the only thing that has changed with regard to 'cyberthreats' is that this work which is thought to be the work of a state actor, has become public and that the method has changed a bit.  It's not as if the Chinese (or the US or whomever) were not spearfishing each other or using other methods to extricate sensitive information.<p>One other difference is that this is equivalent to low-grade but effective sabotage.  I guess we can expect more of this kind of sabotage, yet, it's not as though there aren't state actors and non-state actors attempting this kind of sabotage for either economic, political, military or other reasons on a routine basis.<p>I also imagine there are tacit rules by which they 'play'.  That is, some is expected, some frowned upon, but seen as par for the cyber course, but other things might be seen as totally off-limits (like remotely sabotaging a reservoir's gates sitting atop a city).  That's to say, this form does not involve collateral killings.

Supposedly this is because the fewer calories you consume the less exposure your body has to free radicals that are important in aging. The corollary of this is that building muscle, which requires eating a lot, is inferior to being a skinny rake for longevity alone. Then, if you eat barely anything, you would be better with only a small amount of exercise.<p>And, just to rule out any suspicion of bias, know that I have a job where Im constantly lifting weight, I have my own strength exercise regime outside work, I drink protein shakes, and I eat quite a lot for my frame.",1340160694

How do you bundle pricing and billing into an SaaS app beyond providing making certain libraries available?  What payment provider are you using?  Paypal?  Braintree?  Stripe?  That depends on the subscription model you want to implement.  Is your app a 30 day bill cycle?  Paid yearly?  Billed on the first of every month?  Does it offer a 12-month prepay discount?

Is the world a better place if those insights are kept proprietary, or if they are made public knowledge via the patent process?<p>Software patents have been misused in many contexts, but for work that genuinely transformatively advances the state of the art, is protecting the right to have a viable business around this insight while making the mechanics of this knowledge public, is that a bad thing?<p>And just to repeat myself, broadly yes software patents have been awarded inappropriately time and again. But for those true insights, is a world better with a patented computational insight or a proprietary one?",1340157828

But I doubt that it was because the phosphors are cheaper. Computer terminals and monitors were very expensive back then, but commercial color television made some of the common components (like phosphors) relatively cheap.<p>Green was found to be readable and pleasant. It was the most common for IBM equipment (such as the PC monochrome display).<p>Amber is very visible, especially in bright light. It was popular too.<p>White was popular with DEC terminals.",1340157775

It was common to get invited to weekend gatherings or to go out and get drinks at the marina after work.<p>I have a German last name that is similar to a common Jewish name, so people would very regularly ask if I was Jewish.  I would explain that I wasn't; it could have been uncomfortable, but never was.  In fact, it was nice not being Jewish because nobody ever pressured me to move there.<p>Jerusalem is a totally different story.  I didn't get the feeling it was a friendly or safe place for outsiders.  I wasn't comfortable there.<p>I also hated flying into or out of the country because of the security interviews; it seems very invasive to an American.<p>But Tel Aviv is very non-religious, open, laid-back and friendly.  The technical talent is also very strong.  Everyone speaks english it seems, even people working at Burger King.<p>In short, I never really had the desire to move there, because I'm not really a hot weather beach guy, but I could see why it would appeal to others to do so.",1340157697
