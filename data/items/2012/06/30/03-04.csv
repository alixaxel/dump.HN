It leads to lots of trying to prove you aren't a ""normal"" person or somehow inferior so the people around you won't treat you badly.  It is a miserable way to live.<p>The people who are actually weird and different are treated badly by the so-called ""socially awkward"" nerds.

4180343,comment,4177172,4180317,1,0,flatline3,,,"> <i>Because, obviously, if I didn't like OS X, I just didn't understand it!</i><p>No, you just plain don't understand how to use it, so there wasn't really any room left to discuss its relative merits. Whether or not you liked it is irrelevant given that your judgements were based on an acquired understanding of Linux, and a terse at best understanding of Mac OS X.<p>Let's just take your git example:<p>> <i>More recently, I tried to install Git on OS X (without administrator access). It was a horrible pain, so now I only ever log on to the Linux servers at school</i><p>How exactly was it more difficult on Mac OS X? Did you try to ./configure && make && make install by hand, just like on Linux-sans-admin-access? Or did you try to use MacPorts' or homebrew's support for running without admin access, and simply tried '(port|brew) install git'?<p>Or, let's talk about Java:<p>> <i>I did use OS X for Java development for a whole year.</i><p>During that whole year, you never stumbled onto Apple Menu -> Software Update? It runs automatically, you don't even have to invoke it manually.<p>You never googled ""Mac"" and ""Java"" and determined that Apple provided the Mac port of Java? Assuming this was in the time period of the 1.5 release, you never found Soylatte using Google, and used that?<p>Or, your friend with the LaTeX problem:<p><pre><code>  port install texlive\n</code></pre>\nWorks fine.",1341025905

To try and allay these kinds of concerns, we've also provided a completely free option with 100% of the scheduling/reminder functionality of the paid option. Wagering is completely voluntary.

Linkification was being done in the '80s, based on one of the programs that someone managed to scrounge up in the thread, and the '90s as well. No patents issued - people just did it.<p>The fact that these programs were written tells us that software writers innovate regardless of whether patents are issued for their work or not. That's the nature of software (and technology in general). The difference is, some software makers don't expect to protect their new features from competitors with patents. That's the crux of it, imo.",1341025642
