4059900,story,,,2,1,cowardthrowaway,"Ask HN: Is it a good idea to comment on US political issues?",,"I am not a resident of US but I have been planning to move to US for work in some time. My political views on some of the international issues don't align with US.<p>For example on http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4052719 I wanted to comment something that could be marked as anti-US foreign policy. Now I don't have any strict reservations about the intentions of US government; on the other hand it doesn't often mingle well with benefit and security of the country that I belong from. I wrote this huge comment explaining my views and in parts taking a Anti-US policy stand and just before I post it, I realize something of this sort can be marked against me. From what I have known US authorities do a solid background check - and if they have a way to weed you out of the process, they will be very happy to do it.<p>Are my fears justified? Should a foreign national who wants to enter US as a tourist or as an employee of an US firm take a public stand against US? Does it compromise he/her chances of getting a VISA?<p>PS: Just to make it clear, even if it does comprise the chances, I see why that stand would be taken. And if I were running a country and had to choose between two candidates: one who absolutely loves my country and the other that doesn't do it with that much completeness - I would have had made such a filtering process. But I want to know if that is the case with US.<p>Thanks!",1338692370

I wouldn't trade it for anything. I skimmed the quora post, and boy... that guy's life sounds horrible.<p>I sleep well most nights, but I stress on others. The pressure is on since we've taken money and don't yet earn enough to curb the burn. I also have this belief (crazy?) that we're doing something awesome, and have the background to accomplish it. I've always felt that I (+ my cofounder) have the agency to be in control of our destiny. I've never been more responsible for the outcome of things than I am today.<p>I'm guessing that the people who don't sleep well are (too far) out of their depth and the weight of their impending doom unless they figure it out is crushing.<p>As the CEO, I've taken on the bulk of the shit work - like administrative stuff - getting a lawyer, accountant, bookkeeper, bank account (the list goes on). I spend less time than I'd like on the product. Maybe 10-15 hours a week in the code / learning. A lot of time emailing, organizing meetings and phone calls. Overall though, it's fun and rewarding work.<p>We are building something that doesn't exist in the world and providing it to other people in exchange for money. How cool is that!",1338692349

In this article's case, this was a PAAS model where you upload your code, choose the supporting services, and expect a given service level in return.  For some, this works great, for others - well, see the OP blog post.<p>In my organization's case, we run all of our infrastructure ""in the cloud"" - mostly AWS.  But, we view AWS as an <i>infrastructure</i> cloud provider meaning we choose the hardware available, develop and run our own stack, and go from there. We also have infrastructure with ServerBeach and 100TB.com - and, yes, we consider that ""cloud"" as well.  Just because your code doesn't run well on a PAAS cloud provider doesn't mean that my code won't prosper on a ""cloud"" infrastructure provider.<p>Here is the deal: if you've never seen, in person, the server that you are paying for - you are in the ""the cloud.""  And that is going to be most of us out there.  And for those of you that ""own"" your own boxes, that still doesn't mean you aren't ""in the cloud"" - because you probably setup your <i>own  internal cloud</i> at that point.<p>Edit: SAAS to PAAS",1338691764

4059867,comment,4056322,4056322,1,0,rexreed,,,"There's a lot to be said about companies with great visions, good execution, and practical business models, but still have trouble getting funding. While it's true that customers are the best way to fund a company, and why look to external capital if you can get that, it's also true that funding helps you make investments in talent, resources, and reach that could help you reach goals faster or ""bigger"".<p>Companies like these have a heck of a time raising capital from the ""traditional"" funding available for startups - angels and VCs. I can speak to that first hand. It's so infuriating to see companies that haven't yet proven themselves to be businesses raising hordes of capital and getting loads of attention while the more ""boring"" ones have to bootstrap and scrape their way. Much of this is because the boring types are not in markets where there is significant froth. Perhaps this makes traditional VCs uninterested because of the low multiples. Or perhaps it's because the perception is that if you have a rational business model, then you should just execute on it - why need capital at all?<p>While I can see plenty of practical reasons why VC and angel investors are reluctant to invest in boring businesses that can bootstrap, sometimes it takes a long time for companies to bootstrap to a point where the founders can pay themselves, let alone scale. Many times external investment is used not just to add new people and resources, but also pay the founders. While being hungry is good from an entrepreneurial perspective, starving for too long can make people desperate and chase cash at the expense of the company vision.<p>I say all this because it's troublesome that companies have to resort to karaoke as a way to fund basic operational expenses. That is, unless the startup founders truly like it and it's a corporate culture sort of thing, in which case, more power to you! But often times it's not out of pleasure, but rather, necessity. I keep thinking about the AirBnB fellow who had to sell cereal to keep the company afloat. And only once he ""de-risked"" his company substantially, he was able to seek funding, now at a healthy valuation.<p>What are the funding options for those of us with boring businesses that nonetheless want to scale to significant size? Is it all bootstrap, karaoke, and cereal (and maybe Kickstarter, altho it seems they reject these sorts of businesses as well), or is there another good option?",1338691288

So far the SLS (using a powder or sand) seems to be stuck in the very high commercial range though it can be the most useful, it requires far less fiddling with to get things to print out regardless of their shape like a reprap does, and can get very good material reuse like SLA does since unused material is just kept in the same state.
