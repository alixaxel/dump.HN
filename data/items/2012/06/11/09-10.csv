4093866,comment,4092880,4092880,8,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Sounds like a great title for a new blog entry. Does Betteridge's Law apply all of the time?<p>Obviously this is true about factual reporting -- the <i>real</i> law seems to be making a judgment on the supportability of the facts, which is only important when you are doing factual reporting. If you are doing analysis, many times the entire purpose is to answer some tough question, so having a head with a question mark makes sense.<p>Also note that if you couldn't answer the question with a ""no"" then there wouldn't be much point in doing the analysis in the first place. Many times the nature of these stories are such that you could call it either way, and what the editor wants is for you to go research it and make the best guess you can. That's a fair type of analysis article Note the I believe analysis and commentary articles should be clearly-marked and set aside from normal reporting.<p>What I see a lot of -- in major media outlets -- is analysis pieces masquerading as news stories. From  bloggers I see a lot of half-baked opinion pieces with question mark heads where the blogger basically just throws a couple of facts out and waves his hands around some, hoping to stir up a fight. It's true that question marks in headlines are a warning sign, but it's a heuristic, not a law.",1339408497

4093862,comment,4093725,4093824,8,0,patio11,,,"People are often demonstrably incapable of deciding whether results are poor, misleading, or wrong.  For example, they routinely delegate that decisionmaking to trusted advisors who they have picked in a not-strictly-speaking-rational manner (e.g. most middle class people abominably overpay for investment advice from people who give them screamingly bad advice.  This is the nearly universal finding of decades of research.  Evidence for ""If you're paying 2% to a broker to buy a mutual fund with 2% fees you are making a bad decision"" is substantially more certain than ""Cigarettes: not that great for you!"" and yet people make that decision every day.  They will make it, in controlled laboratory settings, for things as frivolous as $250 of airline miles.)<p>A specific example of this with regards to information search problems: not only are people incapable of telling whether a SERP is a good SERP or not, you can create <i>objectively bad SERPS</i> and then sell them as good by, e.g., mimicking either a) the design, b) the branding, or c) the design and branding of, e.g., a Google SERP.  There exist studies of what happens when you e.g. dress up Yahoo results in Google CSS (people will prefer them over Google results in Yahoo CSS or, for that matter, Google results in Google CSS).<p>With specific relevance to the giving of money, I have access to anecdotes from the SEO world that occasionally curl my toes.  A fairly common trick is a review site with the review stars awarded by ""sort by affiliate commission, descending"", which obviously bears no relationship to quality results.  It doesn't just work, it works <i>astoundingly well</i>.  And not only does it work astoundingly well, it works astoundingly well on people who one would presume are fairly savvy about quite-involved purchases where the dollar amounts involved will, frankly, swamp the total lifetime value of all paid-for HN searches.  (e.g. Obscuring particulars a little bit, would you expect that anyone would make a decision for a seven-figure software deployment at a $FINANCIAL_INSTITUTION on the basis of a starred review site with a name spiritually similar to www.best-bank-software.biz?  <i>cough</i>  Demonstrable evidence of success.)",1339408393

4093850,comment,4092202,4092567,1,0,hef19898,,,"From my personal experience, the stigma outsourcing carries is not per se due to outsourcing itself. I work in a non-tech company and work a lot with our internal IT on both internal and external developments. And one thing they have in common is that the actual testing is done once the development is done. And there I don't see any difference between internal and external dev.<p>What is sure on the other hand is that if dev is outsourced, and I mean like in we buy it from someone who has some code crunchers on the other side of earth with a liason (again subcontracted) aat our place, is that internal developers have some acquired knowledge of processes and the business.<p>My personal opinion is, if you find some way to conduct tests and reviews during the development, your product will be less-bug ridden, more userfriendly and ready faster. And if you can pull this, it doesn't matter who does the development. Again, time and distance play a role, but that's not exclusive to outsourcing.<p>What non-tech companies usually do on the other hand is providing some specs, give them to some external big-name, hope everything goes fine and then conduct some final tests under high time pressure two weeks before go live. And when that doesn't work, they blame outsourcing while it's actually the process that is broken.<p>But that's actually good news for all the start-ups out there!",1339408011

The correlations seem pretty complex.<p>In Europe, I don't see any real causal connection between tax rates and strength of the economy. If anything, there appears to be a bit of a causal connection in the opposite direction: weaker, less-developed countries have lower tax rates in order to try to lure businesses from better-developed countries. By percentage of GDP, these are the five highest-tax EU countries: Denmark, Sweden, Belgium, France, Norway. The five lowest-tax are: Lithuania, Romania, Switzerland, Latvia, Ireland.<p>And Germany, which has probably the strongest business sector in Europe, is towards the top; at 41% of GDP taxation, closer to Denmark's 49% than Lithuania's 21% (or the USA's 27%).
