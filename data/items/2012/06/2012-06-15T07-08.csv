That means that someone somewhere along the road, had the same idea/problem (but limited to files) as you and whipped up a parser to produce that meta-data. That particular parser proved to be so useful to so many people, it became it's own program.<p>There's more than 40 years of sofware-""evolution"" contained in unix, and apparently retrieving structured on the command-line has only proven universally useful for files. Unix has outlived many at the time more modern operating systems, and I think it's partly because it lacked a ""grand unifying vision"". 
Instead it has a ""small, quick&dirty unifying vision"" of which ""flat text processing"" on the commandline is a central part. It has turned out to be the greatest common denominator for being able to write programs, that might be quick and dirty oneliners, but ultimately they got the job done. And only those tiny little utilities that proved to be universally useful were developed into bigger more stuctured programs.<p>I'm not saying you idea is without merit, but it does apply the principle of ""this concept A is useful for this particular problem-set. Let's apply it natively to <i>all</i> problem-sets so it can be useful there too!""

Players play mercenaries battling on planets. The <i>utterly amazing</i> thing is, this game is actually integrated into the EVE universe. Dust players are actually mercenaries being hired and fighting <i>in real time</i> on the planets in the EVE galaxy. EVE players will be able to put up contracts for Dust mercenaries to assault other corporations' facilities, and Dust mercs will be paid by the EVE pilots for their services. What's more, Dust mercs can request live orbital strikes from EVE pilots who are above the planet -- this was demonstrated in March this year and blew the crowd's minds. And surface artillery can hit EVE pilots.<p>There's even economic integration. The weapons, tanks, equipment used by Dust mercs will be bought from markets supplied by EVE players' production facilities. It's not fixed prices and unlimited item spawning here: mostly everything can be manufactured. And the facilities Dust mercs fight over may include actual factories and labs -- meaning that they will indirectly influence the prices of things and the fates of corporations in the game. Heck, I'm expecting cross-game corporations to form - elite mercs partnering elite pilots to dominate swathes of star systems.<p>It's literally two games with completely different playstyles built in the same universe, and I haven't heard of anyone pulling this off before. I'm terribly excited to see what the future holds for EVE, Dust, and multiplayer gaming.<p>----Further reading----<p><a href=""http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/03/24/dust-514-presented-at-eve-fanfest-2012/2#comments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://massively.joystiq.com/2012/03/24/dust-514-presented-a...</a><p>>>> During the DUST 514 keynote speech, developers demonstrated orbital bombardment of a DUST match by EVE players in realtime. We saw the orbital command center and surface command centers that enable communication between the two games; we also saw the orbital artillery that let DUST players retaliate against players in orbit.<p>>>> In addition to PvP matches organised by NPC corporations, there will be co-op PvE survival missions in which players fight off hordes of rogue drones -- living machines with a collective consciousness. The PvE mode will be released in 2012, and there are some exciting plans for expansions scheduled for the year after.<p>>>> 2013 will bring in e-sports and competitive gaming, with gladiator arenas in which players compete in capture the flag, deathmatch and custom game modes. <i>The matches will be a true spectator sport, with live viewing from both the EVE and DUST game client and even betting on matches.</i> Battles on hostile worlds are also due for release in 2013, with tactically different terrain that may require vehicles to get around. CCP confirmed that the highly requested MTACs (mechs) will also be introduced in 2013.<p><i>[Spectator bloodsports, with betting? Crazy!]</i>",1339744616

The same is applicable to all sorts of vendors providing services. It is in their best interest that every one of their clients is successful, in the same way it is of interest to your datacenter facilities that you continue to grow.<p>>> They'll get more new customers tomorrow due to the bad press, simply because those customers were out of the loop and just now heard about Heroku or AWS and it looks cool when they get there.<p>Certainly valid, and that is one of the benefits of having many clients vs. a few ""big"" clients. That doesn't reflect bad on heroku, aws, etc: it's just the nature of the industry they're in. The same applies to your datacenter renting out 1Us at a time instead of whole racks.<p>re: more clientele tomorrow -- plausible, possible, sure! The same applies to datacenter facilities that go offline.<p>>> Running your own servers is the responsible thing to do if you want to OWN your business and not just look cool by using the latest brand named cloud service thrown around by everyone.<p>There are benefits and drawbacks to {running,renting,owning} your own hardware in the same way there are drawbacks to using ""cloud"" providers (IaaS/PaaS). Let's not ignore those.<p>What is applicable to both scenarios however: build redundancy into whatever is important to you. Something, somewhere will fail & you'll be brought offline otherwise.<p>>> No, Heroku/AWS zealots will not agree with me, but they've never run their own data center. They have no experience.<p>I'm not a heroku / aws zealot, I run a competing hosting provider and I think they have their place in the market -- otherwise they wouldn't exist.<p>>> Get real people. The cloud is just a REALLY expensive way to sell shared servers.<p>It's fairly inexpensive to be honest -- it's cheap compared to having a team of sysadmins floating around touching things all day long. Quite frankly it isn't all that expensive in light of the fact that $client doesn't have to concern himself with hardware all day long.<p>>> I run my own servers on 3 dedicated 1gbps connections, and while you pay $0.12/GB on AWS/Heroku (actually, Heroku costs more, but they bury it in their worker pricing so it looks free), I pay $0.01 per GB. That's right, 1 cent per GB.<p>Kudos, you also worry about hardware all of the time -- I've got ~2-3 racks and I spend my days worrying about replacement gear, physical security, network topology & all kinds of other things that one running an app. probably doesn't want to concern themselves with. I mitigate this on behalf of my clients, and they send me money for space & bandwidth in return for them not having to worry about it all day.<p>Heroku & aws do this, too as do many other vendors.<p>>> While an 8-core machine costs me $0.42/hour all tolled (machine, power, space), you pay almost $0.66/hour on EC2 with no SLA, meaning you're not ALWAYS getting the same machine specs every minute of every hour. You're getting a MAXIMUM commitment of resources, not a MINIMUM commitment.<p>Colo. is definitely cheaper, at face value, but quite frankly most of the people on HN are concentrating on building applications. Their mental bandwidth needs to be spent on those applications, not hosting (though, obviously hosting is still part of the equation). Those people who are offline right now would be offline in the same scenario if their dc went offline due to power-outage/$random-reasons-things-go-offline.<p>Why? Because the people offline right now didn't build redundancy into their applications, and they wouldn't have if they had dedicated servers or an entire rack, either.<p>>> Heroku has been down 3+ hours this time, and last year had a 70+ hour outage. On my own servers, I haven't had 3 TOTAL hours of downtime in 5 years.<p>Congrats. Inevitably, a UPS will overload, a switch will die & you'll eat some downtime too. It happens -- build redundancy into your application / service to ensure that thy facility is irrelevant when the time comes.<p>That applies to everyone.",1339744085

File-backed storage (if any storage is even needed) is more than adequate for most cases where one might write a CGI program in C.  The last time I had occasion to write something from scratch and target CGI, I was generating graphs.  No templating, no database, very fast.<p>The major pain of templating lies in C's string handling, though, and if you aren't worrying about freeing memory, there's not much pain.  As far as HTTP goes, if the protocol was designed to be parsed in C, it's not often difficult to parse in C.  But for all of those things, there's a library.<p>I can't comment specifically about whether or not mod_php would be faster (since I used PHP only briefly and several years ago) but I suspect very strongly that the overhead of firing up a small, statically linked C program beats it.<p>As I said previously, I don't think it's usually a good idea, but it's a more than viable tool and nice to keep in the box.",1339743977
