It's rapidly shifting from physical retail to digital delivery, and it's very likely growing very rapidly. Most of that ""other delivery formats"" column is Steam, not mobile and browser games.<p>Of course, no-one outside Valve actually knows that, because they choose do not publish sales data, and they were estimated to have 70% of the digital delivery market in 2009, and probably much more of it now.",1338861583

If that does happen, that would further consolidate the domination of Ubuntu in the Linux World (at least in numbers) as an unintended consequence.<p>I do not see Valve releasing clients for every distro out there.<p>For Linux/Ubuntu to be really strong in gaming, Steam is a big plus, however we also need strong driver support from nVidia and ATI. As far as I know, the best drivers on Linux are still not on par with their equivalent on Windows in terms of performance. If playing the same game on Linux means losing 10 fps on your favorite game, this may not be a very enticing alternative if you have both systems installed.",1338861502

X11 might be complicated of course (because Steam would have to run in the same X11 session as other software), but perhaps Valve are planning this around Wayland?<p>What this would provide is a ""distro within a distro"" where only things like the kernel version would vary. This would potentially allow anything within steam to sidestep a load of the distro compatibility issues. Instead of creating a .deb and a .rpm you just package for Steam.",1338861401

Please publish your ideas and let the world help you with your problem.<p>Actually, you already have. Why _isn't_ there a one-button (or script) way to get started with github? This is exactly the sort of thing github should be doing to extend their community. The instructions at <a href=""https://github.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/</a> (GitHub Bootcamp) seemed pretty good to me, but that just means I didn't fail at some step for impenetrable reasons, and give up. It's not obvious to me that the entire business of starting up, including generating ssh keys and registering them with github, couldn't be done in a simple installer.<p>Next, of course, comes the difficulty in learning to use git. And no, it isn't obvious. I'm not entirely sure the problem can be solved with training, but I am sure it certainly would be better solved by training focused at a particular user community. For example (to pick one out of the air), where is the tutorial for people who collaborate to write a document written in LaTeX? Do they want a centralized, single-master repository with a small number of committers, a centralized repository wiki-style, where everyone on the list can push, or distributed repositories? How to manage these scenarios? What special problems will be encountered because of LaTeX markup? This is probably best addressed by the community of LaTeX users, if they could only get started, and if only they could figure out how to use the tool to best advantage.",1338859417

I was disgusted by his behavior, his comments about his family and the fact he is even associated with the Django community.""<p>There's no variation on ""it was scary, I was concerned for my safety, I felt intimidated"".

All you virtually need is a WebKit instance to build a truly scalable desktop application that uses open standards for most of its components - HTML5/CSS3 for interface and a Couch API for storage.<p>Really awesome! Keep up the good work.",1338858152

For another, Steam was released a decade ago in 2002 - and if that's ""1 decade too late,"" I'd like to see a prototype for a game distribution client that would work on the 1992 internet with 1992 hardware. (Seriously, that would be kind of neat. Very different, I suspect, but interesting nonetheless.)",1338858148

I assume they are working off the 9.2 codebase (hence the beta being the same time as Pg 9.2) but maybe it's only 9.1 (i.e. no JSON).<p>Postgres-XC is probably <i>the</i> most exciting PostgreSQL-related project out there.  It promises full write-extensibility across the cluster without sacrificing consistency.",1338858113

So even though you may be way overpaying for increased memory based on current RAM prices, their data may show that you're much more likely to also use more resources you aren't directly paying for and set the price accordingly.",1338858012
