It's light, very unobtrusive in public, and easy to handle on a bus/train/plane.  There are a few times, when I'm on a long trip, or going out for an afternoon and need to write up some material - where the ability to have a keyboard that could also be a case would be awesome; but it's not for the 95% case with me, it's for the 5%.  Right now - I usually end up bringing my MacBook Air and my iPad when I'm in that situation that I'm going to be doing casual browsing (and enjoying the 10 hour battery, awesome resolution) and heavy keyboard input.<p>Give me a half-decent keyboard case and my next social trip will mean I leave my MacBook air at home.<p>And there are many, many, many people who are passive consumers of the internet - and really don't need a keyboard.

They've been successful because of the way Apple positions the device. It's just a cool toy made by a company with a cult following. You use it to impress your friends, your coworkers, and probably because you want everyone else to think you're a geek that's into the latest tech. In short, it's a status symbol.<p>It doesn't offer anything new in terms of functionality. Everything you want to do in an iPad, you can also do with a modern laptop. Ok, laptops can't do touch screens, but I'll argue that it's not really novel functionality. In fact, as Brydge's Kickstarter campaign has shown, it comes with <i>reduced</i> functionality.<p>Let me stress that I'm not belittling the device.

3902333,comment,3902026,3902185,1,0,shock-value,,,"Actually I think it is useful to compare. Based on what I've seen, the interpolation tech is actually pretty good as long as there isn't too much movement on screen. And yet, in dramas especially, it still severely cheapens the look and makes everything look ""unnatural"". (Even when there is only smooth movement which is well interpolated by whatever algorithm it is using.)<p>So what I am saying is, I actually think it is simply the higher fps that accounts for the distracting nature of these tvs (when interpolation is on).
