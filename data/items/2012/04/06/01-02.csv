In a bigger codebase I have to be more careful about breaking somebody's excessively dynamic code that might be pointing to those things in a roundabout way.<p>As an experiment last year I started teaching myself machine learning by implementing the common algorithms in Clojure and Scala simultaneously. I expected Clojure to win out and worked a lot harder in the beginning but after a while I was forced to concede that my Scala code was cleaner, faster, and less buggy, partly because I felt comfortable changing things because I knew the compiler would help me.",1333677381

That's also my purpose, if you expand ""system"" to include the team that's building it.<p>I agree with Alan Kay that the software industry has become a reductio of wildly inflated complexity and that it's possible to do orders of magnitude better. Presumably, anyone who figures out how to do that will be able to do things other companies can't. That is how the world gets changed. Not by persuading others to do it but by just doing it.<p>For a long time, smart people thought it was a matter of writing in more powerful languages, but it seems clear that it isn't that alone. It's not just the medium, but how we're using it. The 64 billion dollar question is: how can we use it better? And how will we know?<p>My hypothesis (not that I invented it, but I subscribe to it) is that we will know when we are able to build valuable systems with drastically less code. Obviously that requires knowing how much code there actually is. I'm fine with LOC as a metric (some HNers convinced me of that) but you still have to know what code you're measuring and what (e.g. libraries, language implementations, OS) you're not.<p>Interestingly, Kay's VPRI project doesn't have this conundrum because they're building everything up from hardware.",1333675514
