One guy had actually had it happen to him about 18 months ago and he said that he still tells that story with some regularity.<p>I think there is quite a margin between complaining ""up the chain"" and calling the cops (which certainly would be too big a deal).",1334915970

The nonhackers could grab a A10 based tablet, for $120 or so.<p>About the only thing RPi has going for it is the slightly smaller size factor (at >$100 prices).<p>In theory, the first Raspberries should have been sold for $70-$100 by the foundation and only when mass production was assured, then the price should have been dropped to the target $35 for B.<p>The only catch in this dream scenario is: how do you convince the early adopters to pay higher prices, if you are committed to lower prices later on. You do not want to lie to your customers. Maybe some sort numbered certificate system should have been made something like OLPC program, buy one Raspberry for $70 and school or your choice gets one for free when mass production is ready.",1334915952

If you go by measured ridership, it's a no-brainer to cut most trips, because empirically people rarely actually ride late at night (in most U.S. cities, anyway). But when you do, in most cases ridership at <i>other</i> times of day falls also, because people suddenly are worried about the possibility of getting stranded. Even if 98% of the time they never actually use the 2am bus, they like knowing that it's available just in case.",1334915861

They call that fair use - but all those rules do of course not apply to the costly extra services they sell themselves.<p>It's high time to regulate the mobile providers with regards to data / IP services - earlier regulations regarding roaming in Europe have shown that they otherwise do not see any limits in ripping off their customers.<p>And someone should explain to those in charge of oversight of this industry that Cisco's promotional material (that showed exponential growth in mobile traffic and would turn all mobile provider latest next year unprofitable and is so happily cited in that industry when it comes down to regulations) is just that - promotional material to sell their network equipment and not facts.",1334915767

When oral exams work well they're hard to beat with another method, but the setting tends to favor more gregarious personalities with social confidence, and penalizes students who get very nervous or flustered in that kind of on-the-spot, face-to-face situation.<p>Being able to handle that setting is also a useful skill, of course, so you could argue it's fair to test. It's not the only useful skill, though, and it's not clear to me if it's being overweighted (even when I actively try not to). For example, in a computer graphics course, there are students who could do brilliant work if you let them sit alone for 60 minutes with a compiler (or with a piece of paper and some formulas), but who don't shine when examined orally, and vice-versa. There are some students who will do well in all modalities, and some who'll do poorly in all, but I think there's a significant number who will do differently depending on whether your exam is a 30-minute oral exam or a 3-hour take-home exam, so that choice really changes what you're testing for.",1334913803
