3873880,comment,3871053,3873432,1,0,TomatoTomato,,,"Sorry for making the mistake, I would edit if I could.<p>You can metric the system however you want.  It is just out of context under the FairTax to focus on labor wages.  Warren Buffet only makes like 600k in ""wages"" and just pays the capital gains taxes on everything else he cashes out (or consumes).  That's why is tax/earnings is so low.  But calling the FairTax progressive by saying the rich who save/invest will be paying less is short-sighted.  One can just as easily do this exact same thing with tax-deferred accounts or other complicated financial engineering today.<p>Yes, even if you make $10MM labor wages in a year, you will still get the prebate.  Adding X,000 to your $10MM income will barely make a dent, but all citizens over 18? (I believe) will receive the prebate, similar to a social security check, and this can have significantly positive effect on the lower income bracket--especially coupled with the lack of withholding.<p>By the way, to say one can only spend 2,000 on taxable items is impossible.  Even if you simply look at the ""essentials""... food, clothes, utilities, insurance, & transportation, you will easily top $2k in taxable spending but that isn't the point.<p>If you spend all your discretionary income buying used homes, that is certainly your prerogative and would owe zero upfront tax on that purchase. You could just as easily put the money in a 401k type investment or any other tax-deferred account today and get the same effect.  The current system uses a tax deduction and then the net income is what is used to calculate your tax.  The difference though, is when you cash out that investment, you will pay the standard rate on the principle, but only 15% on the capital gains.  Does that make sense?  In the FairTax you will pay the standard rate on both the principle and the capital gains.  The complexities would be gone.  I think the bill itself is only around 100 pages.  The high-priced tax accountants and lawyers won't be able to finagle P&L statements, establish irrelevant corporations to funnel money through, and lobby for special deductions.",1335067109

3873863,comment,3872862,3873441,2,0,nerdfiles,,,"I believe bringing the concept of a fact into question will do more harm than good. A phone book is _not merely_ a set of facts, but also a set of agreements. Surely one can look inside the phone and disagree with one's own listing. If one were to dive into an API and find that it mistakenly calls an undefined function, or typos abound, in this case the API would need to be changed because it has become less functional. It may be rendered useless. A phonebook cannot be rendered useless if even all the numbers are incorrect; though I doubt such a philosophical argument need be presented (Sorite's Paradox).<p>My goal here is to understand the analogy that is being made. True, one could development algorithms from a phonebook such that bank robberies and pranksterism may take place. This possibility secures a conceptual machinery for viewing a phonebook and an API as conceptually similar, since such practices would likely presuppose a concept of hierarchical relationships between numbers and names in the book, assuming sophistication. However, such practice is not the intent behind the phonebook, and so further a concept of hierarchy is unnecessary essentially to the phonebook. An API depends on some basic conceptual metaphor (@see Metaphors We Live By by Lakoff and Johnson to grok the sense in which I use ""conceptual metaphor"") of:<p>A FUNCTION IS INSIDE A CLASS<p>(I do not count sorting or grouping concepts in a phonebook as ""hierarchical."") And this concept is essential to the working of the API. So I believe the comparison is unfair, if not misleadingly true (that APIs and phonebooks are compilations of facts) when thinking of phonebooks whose institutional facts are conceptually nearer, by analysis, in proximity to their brute facts (those facts to which no other facts are necessary to ground their truth). An API and a phonebook are compilations of institutional facts, and should be compared only if the structures of those facts they assert are grounded in relevantly similar conceptual spaces (the institutions wherein those facts are true).",1335066669

3873827,comment,3872224,3873635,2,0,dkarl,,,"Reclaiming memory is a visible side effect.  If you don't do it, your program leaks memory and dies.  Very visible.  It's just a resource like any other.<p>I'm not being deliberately obtuse; I'm just recognizing that RAII and garbage collection are mutually exclusive.  You're telling me that memory is special because it's managed by GC, but that's a little unfair, because assuming GC renders the entire discussion moot!  If you assume garbage collection, then you've ruled out RAII, and there's no point in discussing the suitability of RAII for <i>any</i> resource.  You simply can't combine RAII with garbage collection (at least pending some linguistic innovation that involved, say, reference-counting objects only for the purpose of destruction and not for the purpose of freeing memory.  Which sounds silly to me.)<p>The reason is that RAII ties resource management to object lifetime, and with GC, there is no deterministic destruction of heap objects, and therefore no such thing as reliable RAII.  Without deterministic object destruction, you end up relying on the programmer to manually ensure the destruction of the resource-managing objects.  The best you can do in the presence of GC is ""with"" constructs (such as CL's ""with-open-file"") which do not give you as strong a guarantee as RAII does, because even with well-designed resource management objects they rely on the programmer to know which types manage resources and to never accidentally use them outside an appropriate ""with"" construct.  Also, there are inevitably times when a resource must outlive the scope of any ""with"" construct.  In the end you are much more reliant on programmer discipline than with RAII.<p>So the question is not whether RAII is suitable for some resources but not for memory, because that is a contradiction given current technology, but rather whether you 1) use RAII both for memory and for whatever additional resources you like, or 2) use GC for memory and use more manual and error-prone (in my opinion) methods for handling other resources.<p>rayiner's objection to RAII is twofold, first that it is simple to manage non-memory resources and second that functional programming style results in a very large number of short-lived objects which are more efficiently handled via GC.  To the first I say that managing file handles and database connections may be easy for him, but it certainly hasn't been easy for all the programmers I've worked with.  When resource leaks stop being a problem, we'll stop looking for solutions.  To the second I say that you can't choose between GC and reference counting on the basis of performance without considering a concrete situation.  In many situations it's better to have a program that is consistently slower than one that is much faster on average but intermittently unavailable.  In other cases you only care about throughput and will therefore prefer GC.<p>Personally, I prefer to choose on the basis of programmer convenience rather than performance.  If resource management is important, that tilts the scales in favor of RAII.  If your program naturally lends itself to object graphs with cycles, that points strongly towards a garbage collected language.  (Though personally I have never found that reference counting versus garbage collection has been the most important difference between two languages anyway, and the only language I'm aware of that really supports RAII is C++, so it's not like you'll ever make a straight-up decision between RAII and garbage collection without a ton of other very strong factors in play.)<p><i>That's why GC is not acceptable for these resources that are not buffers of memory.</i><p>Not to be pedantic... okay, I'm being pedantic ;-) but GC can be used for any set of resources that are linked the way objects in memory are.  For example, the database guys at my last job wrote an ad-hoc garbage collector when they realized that buggy triggers had left a ton of orphaned rows in our database.",1335065578

Paperwork and the cost to keep it straight.<p>Your SG corporation will be a controlled foreign corporation.<p>Unless you are exceptionally well-organized and advised, the income generated by your company would start to look a lot like Subpart F income.  Translation:  all of the profit of the SG corporation is taxable to you as a human being, every year, on your U.S. individual tax return.<p>Now.  You might say ""Meh, profit is profit and if I have to pay tax what does it matter.  I will have to pay tax anyway.""  Well, yes, to a point.  But I will gloss over that or what I talk about will look a lot (to you) as snippets of code look to me.  Unintelligible.<p>The real problem is that the U.S. tax paperwork burden is profound.  And it is beyond the power of mere mortals to do it properly.  You are in the realm of paperwork designed to capture transactions and operations of companies of Google's ilk.  Not ordinary small businesses.<p>And if you screw up the paperwork, the penalties will eat you alive.  E.g., Form 5471.  This is where you tell the IRS ""Hi, I am an American and I own shares of a foreign corporation.""  File late, and it is $10,000 please as a penalty.  Don't fill it in right, and they say it is an incomplete therefore failed filing.  $10,000 please.<p>Things start there and get worse.<p>The cost of running a SG corporation in SG annually is nontrivial.  The cost of people like me is nontrivial.  (I'm de-f'ing a SG corporation right now for a guy in precisely this position).<p>All of that money you save living in Cambodia will go to pay the overhead of your corporation.  I don't recommend living cheap just so you can give $10,000 to someone like me.  :-)<p>If you are an American and you want to live in a cheap country, kind of under the radar, and run your business from there, set up your company in the USA.  Run it from there.<p>The probability of making a mess of international tax filings approaches 1.0 in a very few years.  The probability of making a mess with domestic corporate or LLC filings is very low.<p>The cost of talent to keep your international corporate structure straight is extremely high.  (I'm $750/hour and I'm not taking on any new clients at the moment).  The cost of talent to run a generic domestic corporation -- you can get that anywhere from any random accountant and corporate lawyer.<p>That's my suggestion.  Running away is the best strategy.
