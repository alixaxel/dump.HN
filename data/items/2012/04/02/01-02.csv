I used a rhythm mnemonic in middle school to remember pi to 106 digits in middle school, and that was the day of the quiz (it was extra credit in... geometry for some reason). Actually the more you practice these techniques on completely ordinary and mundane things, the easier it becomes when attempting formulae, tables, and graphs. Saving your memory for ""important things"" will only deprive you of essentially free practice. The periodic table is actually a good place to start as long as you don't overwhelm yourself, so for example start with the names of the elements in order, then the numbers will associate, and you can keep building with recursion. OR you could begin with smaller blocks if you're more comfortable absorbing a lot of different information at once, which can sometimes work much better.",1333331979

However, it takes a long time to kill anyone without active movement – hunting down near-dead ships is the best way to get best kills/minute.

Many will argue that relative to your total cognitive power the cost is virtually zero but I don't think the discussion needs to go that way, and here's why: like anything, the beginner has to force everything. You put in the effort consciously because you recognize it as a step in some process. If the technique remains a novelty, then that's where you'll stay. Your associations may get ever more clever, simpler, faster, etc. But when you start to apply it constantly in your work and in everything else that you do, soon the technique simply fades into the background until at some point it might as well have disappeared. It's like math or spelling as a child, where you have to learn step by step what is and what isn't until it clicks, and then the why no longer matters. You add two numbers because that's the way it works– you don't have to convince yourself. As your memory progresses you the junk associations will fade out and stronger associations predominate, because they're relevant and you want to remember relevant things.<p>Edit: this is especially relevant to the ""read me a list and I'll repeat it forwards, backwards, or in any order you call out"" party trick.",1333331353

I never performed an image replacement (e.g., the ace of spades actually equals something else,) but did try to abstract the items.  For example, for pickled garlic, I imagined a car-sized jar of pickles, but the pickles were garlic shaped.  Instead of cottage cheese, I imagined (as instructed) Charisma Carpenter bathing in a large cottage cheese tub.<p>To this day, both I and my daughter can remember the list perfectly, by walking through the house and looking how we should.<p>I haven't gone much farther with it to the degree that I would have had to encode a lion into an ace of spades, but just exaggerating the image itself into a more memorable form works for me.  I also have the same lack of visual imagination, but following the instructions in the book exactly as offered worked perfectly.<p>One of the catches though, is that numerous memory champions will tell you that becoming really good at mnemonic memory is really a game of who can be more imaginative.<p>Some routines (like memorizing a deck of cards) can become rote, as you already have the cyphers in your head, you just have to encode them.  The more advanced mnemonists have partial encoding techniques such that one mnemonic image can encode a 3 or 4 card sequence.  That doesn't take imagination, just discipline... but encoding things, on the fly, that you haven't predetermined the pattern to, is a game of imagination.<p>That said, you might suck at it, as I sort of expect to suck at it myself.

As suggested by my previous paragraph, I think it is worth distinguishing between ""the police"" as a societal institution capable of profoundly affecting those within its sphere of influence and those individuals from which it is composed.<p>In particular, it seems that attributing systemic problems to the individuals through whom they are expressed leads to a pair of difficulties. The first difficulty is that which you encountered, in which one hesitates to apportion any blame due to the perception that any assigned blame would correspond to an attribution of evil/malicious intent to a fellow flesh-and-blood human. The second difficulty is that pursuing solutions to a systemic capacity for sustained malicious ignorance/incompetence/ineptitude through actions targeted at the individuals through whom this capacity is expressed offers a potent example of the potential futility of treating symptoms rather than causes.<p>Note that my view converges with (my interpretation of) yours in the sense that I consider it important to avoid unnecessarily shifting blame earned by an institution onto its constituents, as this is unlikely to ameliorate systemic problems while generally producing negative consequences for those onto whom blame is shifted.",1333329907

Lots of information is already collected in the normal and proper operation of things like cellphones (for E911 -or- Facebook).  There is VERY little case-law on this specific subject but I think my <i>point</i> (which we were originally arguing) that there is a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"" is enshrined in law.<p>The fact that you are driving a car on a public road isn't necessarily <i>private</i>, but I think it would be reasonable to suggest that the exact movements of a person over a period of a year (for example), to include who they might be co-located with in a specific property, or other pertinent meta-data DOES constitute something we would reasonably expect to be private.<p>To your other point:<p>""What a person knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a subject of Fourth Amendment protection.""<p>There are MANY MANY instances where personal data is exported and stored without the knowledge of an individual that create all sorts of legal minefields for you.  For example, I might be fully aware that my car is not invisible and can be seen by people on my street.  I might be completely unaware that my cellphone is regularly broadcasting my location to Verizon or ATT even when I'm not using it.<p>There is a HUGE gap in public understanding of the practical effects of this technology use and the repercussions of that use.

I am lucky to have found a good company, but that fight you had is still going on in my head. Most of the problems I solve at work are new to me, and nothing from my university is relevant, including the algorithms class. For instance, I have never used git in school. In fact, nobody has even mentioned it. Just think about it for a moment. How important is something like git or its equivalents, as compared to outdated theory bound knowledge?",1333328614

Since the user.referrer object might be a bit slow to load from the DB, we want to delay its loading until we actually use it (lazy load it) and not load it at all if we don't use it. This is not possible in Node.js because every I/O calls (i.e. database calls) are async. In other words, we have no guarantee user.referrer will be loaded in time (before  console.log() outputs the result).<p>Every time we want to load something from the DB, we need to supply an explicit callback which will be called one the DB query is completed.<p>Of course, there are several ways to achieve the same result in async style, but none of them are <i>transparent</i> to the programmer. You will either have to load the referrer object upfront or supply a callback whenever you need to load it.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>    orm.load('User', 'some unique id...', function(user) {\n        user.referrer.onLoad(function() {\n            console.log(user.name + ' was referred by ' + user.referrer.name);\n        });\n    });</code></pre>",1333328588

I finished my degree during the summer of 08--right before the recession hit my area very hard. Then I took up a lot of random writing and entry level programming freelance gigs to make the rent (kind of a digital blue-collar worker).<p>Since then, I’ve been going through a very long period of anxiety and depression (long family history), sometimes very severe. After a lot of counseling, some medication, and getting my shit together (exercise, diet, etc), I feel like I’ve finally gotten better.<p>I feel like I’m transitioning into a new period of life. Work feels so much easier to do. But, I can’t help but feel guilty. A lot of years feel like they’ve been wasted and some pretty bad mistakes were made when I first started freelancing.<p>Needless to say, I’m going to continue to pursue programming and eventually entrepreneurship.<p>Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated.",1333328551
