3839549,comment,3838757,3839468,9,0,9999,,,"I was going off the description of Blow's aims and goals for The Witness from the article:<p>Blows decision to bare his soul in The Witness springs from this same drive to live up to the full potential of his artistic medium; a meaningful game, he believes, must be an honest one. The Witnesss narrator, he freely admits, is a thinly veiled version of his own psyche. When the narrator speaks of his guilt over spending millions to create an island filled with puzzles instead of using that money for worthier causes, this is Blows real spiritual dilemma. When the narrator reflects on his feelings of empty vanity, on his alienation from others, on his yearning for truth and deep understanding, these are Blows pains and desires.<p>Honesty and truth in storytelling is certainly important, but the kind of honesty he is talking about there is a boring truth.  It reminds me of the same kind of thinking that produced Cinema Verite, and what Werner Herzog had to say about that philosophy:<p>""By dint of declaration the so-called Cinema Verit is devoid of verit. It reaches a merely superficial truth, the truth of accountants.""<p>Even if I am not interested in Blow's pains and desires, I do respect the fact that he is deliberating on them, and hopefully encouraging other game developers to do so.

When you copy-and-paste something into your own work, copyright covers the copying.<p>One technicality is that until you compile the program, no copying is taking place, so the GPL can't apply to source code.  The only argument against that I see is that you're <i>intending</i> for the copy to take place, which is as good as the copy actually taking place.  But I have no idea.  (OTOH, not many people try to avoid the GPL when sharing their source code anyway.)<p>If you have a billion-dollar idea that depends on the GPL working, you should probably hire a very good lawyer to advise you.",1334366455
