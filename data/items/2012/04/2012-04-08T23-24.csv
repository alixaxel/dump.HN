3815290,comment,3814363,3814524,5,0,koeselitz,,,">> Apple solved this problem before it ever became a problem, but they are attacked because their brand is strong, and the people attacking them lack integrity.<p>This seems like hyperbole to me. What I mean is that <i>Apple itself</i> does not make this claim. They are honest about what things are good, and what things need work. Their audits often show problematic stuff; there have been reports of underage workers, workers exposed to toxic chemicals, etc. To Apple's credit, the company has worked to close those gaps. But it's clearly not the case that there have never been any problems at Apple's Foxconn factories, or that they ""solved this problem before it ever became a problem.""<p>Moreover, I don't think it's fair to take the facts that Apple jobs and longer hours are desirable at Foxconn and extrapolate from them that everything there is ideal. Let's be honest: factory work in China is not exactly the finest working environment ever conceived. There are a lot of really bad things that go on there. The fact that Apple is the best as far as Foxconn jobs are concerned does not by any means indicate that there are no problems whatsoever with the working or living environment. Again, to Apple's credit, they haven't put forward this excuse and commenced to ignore their critics; they've actively and honestly confronted the problems in the working environment in their factories, and tried to fix them, even when they've already exceeded standards set by other factories in the Foxconn group.<p>I think it's really important that we work to avoid whitewashing the difficult conditions at the Foxconn factories. It's really fantastic what Apple's done so far, but that doesn't mean there's nothing more to do. In our rush to speak well of a company that has done some really awesome things, let's not overstate the good they've done, lest we lose sight of why they're doing it.",1333929415

3815286,comment,3814363,3814826,3,0,theoj,,,">> The data does support the case.<p>Oh, it does? Let's look at the article together and see if we can find that data:<p>>> (The US rate is) 3.5 per 100,000: we would expect, if the Foxconn factories were no more dangerous than the average American workplace, 35 workplace deaths a year among those 1 million workers. Yes, each of those deaths, each of those injuries, in those aluminium dust explosions is a tragedy. But if we were being realistic rather than spouting nonsense over such matters we would not be using evidence of three or four deaths as evidence of how Apple, Foxconn or even China are ignoring worker safety in pursuit of filthy lucre. At a very minimum we would be looking at the total workplace death rate rather than cherry picking one specific incident.<p>The author's saying he's heard of 3-4 people killed... so how does that map to 7 in the infographic? Where exactly are the Foxconn stats coming from? Because the ""data"" offered in this article is ""as-seen-on-TV"". Is there even a system of reporting mandated by the national govt to collect data? In the absence of actual vetted data, how can you conclude that Foxconn manufacturing is 5-10 times safer than avg US manufacturing?<p>>> But why would they be hiding fatality stats?<p>If you are Foxconn, do you want people talking about Foxconn and fatalities in the same sentence? And if the govt doesn't require it, do you feel compelled to use your own internal resources to voluntarily compile and publish stats that make you look bad?",1333929230

It explicitly opted out of BART in order to spend more money on freeways, giving it the distinction of being one of the few places in the US that has not only national interstate highways and state highways, but also <i>county</i> highways built to full freeway standards (overpasses, etc).<p>Transit convenience is much better in New York, Boston, or Chicago, and many people in New York don't own cars. Heck, even other parts of the Bay Area are better; if you live in SF or Berkeley you don't need a car, and many people don't have one.<p>In any case, it's the intercity lines I'm more skeptical of, which so far (I live in Copenhagen) don't seem all that much better in Scandinavia than Amtrak in speed or frequency. You can go once per hour Copenhagen-Stockholm, for example, which is about the same frequency as the Boston-NYC-DC route. And like the US, once you get off one or two main routes, everything is slow and infrequent. For example, Copenhagen-Oslo (600 km) runs twice a day (with one change) and most people fly instead. I've also ended up giving up and flying instead every time I've tried to find a train from Copenhagen to continental Europe. It looks like getting to some German cities would be possible, but getting to Amsterdam would've required 12 hours and two changes.",1333928479

3815240,comment,3812092,3812092,1,0,leoedin,,,"Power users, ranking users or in any way giving precedence to users with a history of popularity has been the death knell for a number of online communities. It's consistently a poor way of identifying users who make positive contributions to the site, and it's a consistently good way to alienate new and occasional users.<p>I suspect there's two reasons for this. The first is that popularity is not necessarily indicative of quality. Take a look at Reddit's front page today, and you'll have a hard time picking out anything worth reading from the memes and jokes. Popularity normally reflects the lowest common denominator. Rewarding users for being popular inevitably leads to users rewarded for pandering to popular opinion, rather than for making insightful or meaningful contributions.<p>The second is that engagement level rarely is indicative of comment quality. The internet is a vast place with a huge number of users, and as a number of studies (particularly on Wikipedia [1]) have shown, a users commitment to the project or website doesn't correlate with contribution quality. Essentially, contributions from a new or rarely commenting user are just as likely to be worthy as those from long standing members.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/10/anonymous-good-samaritans-may-produce-wikipedias-best-content.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/10/anonymous-good-sa...</a><p>I've been actively commenting and engaging forums, social news sites and other online communities which allow commenting on topics since 2002, and time and time again I've seen sites grow in popularity and decrease in quality.

I enjoy engaging in discussion about a wide range of things, and I do my best to find websites that allow and encourage that.

So many things have to happen before <i>cutting off the wrong leg</i> actually get's back to those responsible that losing a 2 million dollar gross negligence lawsuit is less meaningful for a doctor than winning the lawsuit and losing their licence.  There are some really bad doctors out there, but because there are still insurable because it's fairly random when someone get's sued so it takes a long list of errors before they need to look for other employment.  Moving can also help cover someones medical misdeeds.<p>The simplest way to cut down on medical errors is to limit how long someone can be on call.  Life or death decisions at the end of a 12 or sometimes 16 hour day is just insanity.  Yet, it's all to common for someone to end up pulling an 18 hour shift.<p>As to the awards, you can't just take payouts and say this money ends up in the hands of those who where miss treated.  Court cases are expensive and it's not uncommon for someone to receive well below 1/2 the stated award after their legal team get's it's cut.  It also tends to take a long time.<p>My suggesting would be a system with automatic and harsher penalty's where people and institutions are penalized for their average mistakes over time not just the occasional one off case they can buy insurance to cover.  And where people who have been mistreated can automatically receive reasonable compensation without the protracted legal battle.  Unfortunately, I have no idea of how to implement such a system.<p>PS: Then again, I am not really a doctor either.

Seeing a product grow all by itself with little other advertising or marketing is always a good sign.<p>I actually use Pinterest myself to keep track of cool gadgets, books, and since I am in academia, papers, research, algorithms and ideas.<p>I've though about Pinterest's success for a while, and I think its special sauce has to do with permanence, where as most other sites are currently focused around recency. Posting an item to Pinterest feels additive: I am collecting and curating good content, and the entirety of my work is displayed for all to see in very few clicks. On the other extreme is Twitter/Facebook/Google+, where I've even stopped posting good content unless it falls in specific time on a weekday, or I know that it will sink into oblivion, never to be seen again. The time of a post can easily be the difference between 0 and 50+ retweets. (I tested this.)<p>The other major aspect of its success, I believe, is that Pinterest is very visual. This simple truth is obvious, but rarely executed on: People love pictures, and they don't like reading too much.<p>So Pinterest is doing many small things right, but more importantly it's filling a gap in people's desire to express themselves.
