I'm sure Google has more janitors than that.

She touched on a core issue that social networks will have a hard time addressing in the coming years. Perhaps it is because its they tried hard to mimic how relationships worked in the moment and people change, moment by moment. I think the problem that needs to be solved is that people change organically, moment by moment until they are a very different person because of the many small changes that occur through the years.<p>There are no tools that I know of to provide this context of individual change for those who read what we have written or recorded on video years after the fact. And speaking only for myself, I have changed a little since yesterday and a lot since my early twenties.<p>Does that make sense? If we think about leaving a legacy for people we can't know but will be able to speak to in ten or thirty years, how do we provide them the insight into the significant or cumulative changes that influenced changes our beliefs? It's not like we can sit down with them over a beer and say, ""That thing I wrote about social issue X, well I used to believe Y about it and then really significant things happend to me and I completely changed. I know it's weird.""<p>I believe these are very difficult tools to build because they have to capture some of the more ephemeral aspects of humanity in a way thats easy for the producer to manage and the consumer to quickly comprehend.",1334372049

Lack of recourse if there is a breach / loss of data because a supplier is out of jurisdictional reach.<p>4. Sovereign risk - How can I be expected to track pertinent changes to law in foreign jurisdictions?<p>My experience is that in most cases clients don't perceive these risks as insurmountable; they do understand that they are industry wide problems that need to be addressed out, and they do in some cases lead to a preference for local suppliers of hosted software.",1334371677

Which is why they often say I don't care what you believe in just believe in something higher than yourself. You are just stating a belief system i.e. I am a secular humanist not where this belief derived from i.e from rationality we derive our universal moral standards of concern and consideration for other humans. Or some form of utilitarianism that suggests that concern and consideration are in our best interests as a whole society.<p>In reality cultural integration is a bit of an illusion as hegemony rules the law of the land in most cases. Travel to Syria or North Korea right now and you will find that power is the morality people usually follow.<p>To believe that we are all self-rational actors heading towards some grand path of enlightenment and cultural integration in some far off utopia wonderland of cooperation and mutual self-benefit is to ignore the more animalistic and competitive bit of our nature.",1334371335
