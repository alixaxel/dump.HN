Specifically, the ""we're not here now"" Contact button in the bottom-right, in addition to the Support button and the Sign Up button.<p>- You can't drag the scrollbar on the ""Edit Check"" page - it selects part of the page instead.<p>Other than those points, some small stuff: it doesn't say how I get notifications, the ""contact us"" black button obscures the ""Follow Us"" when you scroll to the bottom of the page, and, like bhauer mentions, the color depth seems a bit much - it's almost TO flashy.<p>All criticism aside: I'm still using it for my personal website :-)  It looks like a good product, so keep up the good work!",1334966092

""We saw that you've bought 3 books by George R. R. Martin.  'A Feast of Crows' comes out next month.  Click here (affiliate link) to pre-order.""<p>Ideally, it could also recommend me other books as well using a Netflix-type recommendation engine (or Amazon).<p>I have the name 'booknotice.com', and would happily donate it to anyone who built this.<p>----------------<p>Google sites for event sites.  Djangocon has a website, and only actually updates it a little before and a little after the event.  They don't have anything particularly demanding for a generic web service, but there are things that an event needs that no other site does.<p>Ideally, it needs to handle the irregularity of the event.  Last time I looked at the Djangocon site to see when Djangocon was hitting next, all I saw was details on the event that had already passed.  I want that stuff to be preserved, for sure, but I don't want to be confused in thinking that I can book tickets to last year's Djangocon.  I want the '2013' page to show up, even if it just says ""Event details coming soon"" after the 2012 event has already passed.  It needs to have an archive where I can see who spoke at last year's event, or the event two years ago, and the presentations should be preserved for posterity.<p>Revenue model could be simple monthly hosting costs, or a cost+markup on EC2 compute cycles or something.  If this were done by an established company (say, Heroku or Dotcloud), they could be de facto event sponsors for every event and drive revenue to their core products that way.",1334965761

I have never been sick more in my life, slept this little, ate this poorly, been in this bad of athletic shape, ignored my friends and family as much, and Ive never had more fun. Building this company has taken every ounce out of me, and it has been extremely rewarding.<p>I talk (sometimes preach) about how in this new economic paradigm you will need to learn to live with less income, but that if you utilize the new tools at your disposal, your quality of life will improve. You will also be pushed towards seeing a greater risk/reward to starting your own businesses, both because building things has never been more lucrative and cheap, and because your ability to find employment with someone else is degrading. Its just the reality of the fact that Instagram was sold to Facebook for one billion dollars, and had 13, yes count them 13 employees.<p>But, no matter what new paradigm were operating under, I caution all of you to think long and hard about what it means to be an entrepreneur. If you really want to go for it, quit your cushy six figure job, you are in for a smack in the face.<p>Here are some of the things Ive had to learn this year, even after being entrepreneurial my whole life, and previously starting my own asset management firm from the ground up.<p>Your pride is worth nothing, put it down and ask people for favors.<p>You never get anything from anyone if you dont ask.<p>Learn to love the word No, a lot, and just accept it.<p>Not many people will say the word No to you, understand when someone is saying no without saying no.<p>Getting a no is not the end of the conversation, it is the start, now go and prove to them they should say yes, keep asking.<p>Spend your social capital now, its not worth anything sitting in your Klout score, number of Twitter followers, or the number of hits your blog gets.<p>When looking for investment money, it doesnt matter where your business is at, investors want to see progress not one data point, even if you are extremely early.<p>Sell things before you actually have them. Sell then build. It will take you forever to get anything done if you wait until everything is perfect.<p>Nothing should ever be perfect, or youve wasted time.<p>There is no shame in working out of a coffee shop, stop pretending you have an office.<p>Having an office feels really good when you finally get one after working in a coffee shop for 6 months.<p>Invite everyone to your new office, it will make you feel good and give you energy.<p>You have to celebrate wins, after being told no all the time, you have to celebrate when you win.<p>You will have less sex, just accept it.<p>Your family and friends will think youve fallen off the face of the earth, make sure to send a mass email once every month or two apologizing, then joke about how you promise to take them all on vacation when youre rich, they will understand.<p>Dont sleep at the office, it kills your morale, this is a marathon not a sprint.<p>Dont sleep in the locker room at the hockey rink after your 11:30 PM game, get dressed and go home.<p>If you want to get connected with someone, you must find a trusted contact of theirs to go through. A one line intro from a friend is 1,000,000 better than a cold email or a cold call.<p>You need to spoon feed journalists stories, you cant expect them to figure out what youre doing.<p>Most journalists dont care about your business, tell the story of how your business fits into a larger theme.<p>Incumbents will attempt to discredit you, your business, and your community because they feel threatened, just go run them over, this is a game for big boys.<p>Pivotal tracker only works as well as you use it.<p>The only way to recruit at an early stage is through your connections, its completely relationship based.<p>You need to find specific points on which to build momentum, momentum is everything for your product and your company.<p>Use LinkedIn religiously, go through the contacts of the people you know and ask them for introductions.<p>Learn what resonates and what doesnt when telling people the story of your company, A/B test like you would a feature.<p>Ive made a lot of mistakes this year, as I expected I would. But weve had a lot of great wins at Estimize, and the fun part is just beginning. Im sure Ill write this post again next year and have just as many new things on that list. This year has been the only time in my life I have ever envied someone who is 40 years old, for the fact that they have been through this several times successfully, and dont need to learn these hard lessons over again.<p>Im enjoying the journey though.",1334965295

Obviously, the United States could repeat its lunar feats of the 1960s and 1970s if that were the next most important thing to do in space exploration for the money. But it isnt! We may well return to the lunar surface again as one of many destinations in the future, but for now, our immediate, more scientifically rewarding goals include sending astronauts to an asteroid in the 2020s, and Mars in the mid-2030s.

3870221,comment,3870162,3870162,3,0,bhauer,,,"Just created an account and it looks interesting.  Some random thoughts, take them for what you will:<p>1. The differentiating factor is the 5-second check interval, yes?  Clearly, I am not the target audience for that, but I suppose it could be of interest for some people.  The argument seems to be that there is a measurable difference in the ability to react to an outage if you are notified within 5 seconds versus 60 seconds.  That is true, but I suspect that even at my best, it would take me at least another 5 minutes to do anything about an outage.<p>2. It's not clear on the demo account tier how I would receive notifications.  On the Probe editor, it shows that I will be notified, but not how.  I presume by e-mail at the e-mail address I used to sign up (since you don't have anything else yet).  But it should probably be more clearly indicated.  Aha, elsewhere on the site it's clear the notification is via e-mail.<p>3. Overall the graphic design looks a little too ""templatey,"" if you know what I mean.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not a designer so I don't have any grounds to criticize design.  Nevertheless, a few things could probably improve the look & feel:<p>a. Slightly tone down the color depth.  Right now, many different sections of the page are all popping as if they are accent or highlight colors.
 b. Commission some custom icons.  I don't have any drawing skill, so I too use stock icons.  But considering how heavily you utilize your icons, the icons are important for you.  The icons have no site-specific character.
 c. At the ""Detect Portal,"" the content of most interest to me--the list of monitors--seems among the most diminutive and unimportant visually speaking.
 d. Padding, margin, and spacing. The icons shouldn't touch the borders of their containers.  The label on the ""Create Check"" button looks off-center vertically.
 e. Terminology.  The page names are a little weird; the page title doesn't seem to change?  Also, while I understand what you're trying to do with the main navigation along the left, it's a little odd to click ""Detect"" to get to a list of ""Checks"" which are then called a ""probe"" in the URL.<p>Best of luck!",1334964127

Replacing it with a more Googley type of business like Customer Surveys is probably for the best, but seems like a retreat.",1334962980

Building apps for 2.2 because I have to sucks when 4+ is out. I was just suggesting the magnitude of the problem isn't as big as it is on Android, assuming they don't make a habit of it and WP8 upgrades for a long time.",1334962891

That's the basic idea: many people are already charitable and make donations of money fairly routinely.<p>Why not do that plus attach a little bit of local significance to those donations? It allows you to say to the powers-that-be in your community, ""I am donating this $50 to the American Cancer Society as a bounty on you fixing this particular problem with [insert whatever it is you want done here].""<p>Alternatively, you can mark the donations as bounties that are released to the charities when the tasks complete. This would provide some incentive to those who can actually do the work to see that the tasks get completed.<p>It's an untested concept, but I'm giving it a serious try. I hope to convince a local government or business to do something that the users want done soon.",1334962854
