If you're giving away an <i>opt-in</i> service for <i>free</i>, even if someone tries to sue you, it will be very difficult for them to win.<p>If they were paying you, and their business relies on your service, then they may have grounds for a lawsuit (assuming you didn't do anything to remedy the situation or didn't react appropriately). But if you're giving something away, it's viewed as <i>their</i> fault for relying on your service when it didn't have any type of guarantee associated with it. Web sites have bugs and downtime -- that's an inherent problem with computers -- so unless you make a guarantee that you're providing a bug-free 100% uptime solution, you don't have any obligation to provide a service that exceeds the reliability of even the most advanced multi-billion dollar companies (does anyone have 100% uptime and no bugs?).",1333943013

In my own experience, it was very hard at the beginning but over the course of a few weeks it became second nature. You get used to idiomatic ways of doing things- arranging expressions so that they don't become deep, factoring words apart as a means of reducing the number of elements you care about in a given context, when to use a variable or two to untangle a complex expression.<p>From the debugging side, well-factored code consists primarily of short pure functions with a very small number of code paths. This couldn't be a more perfect scenario for TDD. In my own projects I use an extremely simple unit testing system called the Test Anything Protocol (TAP).

I think the best argument against the module pattern is the difficulty of debugging.  I can no longer just pop open a console and inspect objects.<p>Responses to your individual points:<p>>> * you cannot use previous OOP experience<p>While unfortunate I believe this is largely unavoidable.  Javascript's object system is not 'classical' inheritance.  The module pattern, however, is also not 'classical' inheritance.  Regardless of OOP technique, the New Javascript Programmer must learn about the object system.<p>>> * there are MANY ways to do OOP using prototypes<p>There are also many forms of the module pattern.  You just showed me another one I hadn't seen before.  Then there's immediately invoking function expressions, which some people like to do like this<p>(function () { var exports = {}; return exports; })());<p>and others like to do like this<p>!function() { var private = 4; return { getPrivate: function () { return private; }; }();<p>>> * 'this' has different meanings depending on context<p>Can't argue against this one.<p>>> * prototypes make existing objects unreliable -> requires prior knowledge about libraries and APIs (leaky abstraction)<p>I'm not sure I see the argument here.<p>>> * building an object with prototypes requires far more mental steps: ..<p>I'm not sure you really need to know about all of these things.. but sure, prototypal inheritance is confusing to those with a 'classical' background.<p>As for the advantages:<p>>> * conforms to established industry and business standards in OOP<p>I don't see why prototypal inheritance does not.  If you look at CoffeeScript, it even appears classical.<p>>> * requires less knowledge about language details<p>I have to disagree here.  Explaining object literals and immediately invoking functions and closure isn't all that easy.<p>>> * very transparent, no sugar code or libs required<p>That's true.<p>>> * neat code<p>There's no reason why new/this/prototypal code can't be neat!<p>>> * design patterns blah blah<p>There's no reason why new/this/prototypal code can't do design patterns!<p>>> * protection against corruption<p>I've never seen this as an issue in practice, but my code isn't running in the browser.  Unless you're talking about protection from other programmers, in which case, I would quote Guido van Rossum.<p>>> * no this, that or self variables<p>Could be a good thing or a bad thing.  This means that you have to know what's public and what isn't, rather than it being explicit.  I rather like it when things are explicit.<p>Sometimes we sacrifice a little simplicity for a little flexibility or a little efficiency.  Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes it isn't.",1333941278

Userspace uses virtual addresses, which get mapped through page tables to become physical addresses.  Some kernel addresses get identity-mapped (meaning that the virtual address matches the physical address), while some kernel addresses go through translation as well.  (Specifically, on Linux, kmalloc allocates identity-mapped addresses, while vmalloc allocates virtual addresses; vmalloc allows you to have a large virtually contiguous buffer without requiring a large physically contiguous region of free memory.)<p>> Isn't this what enables the operating system to scramble the allocations it gives you to make it harder to implement a buffer-overflow attack?<p>You can do Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for either virtual or physical address spaces; you want to do it for whatever type of address an attacker could otherwise make use of.  Userspace processes can use ASLR for their virtual address space, so that attackers can't make use of fixed addresses.  The Linux kernel doesn't normally map virtual pages to any particular well-known location in physical address space, either.  The kernel can also use ASLR for some (though not all) of its own kernel-space addresses.  Beyond that, recent versions of Linux also try to avoid exposing kernel-space addresses to non-root users.<p>Also note that ASLR doesn't generally introduce enough randomness in a 32-bit address space.",1333941118

Currently they tend not to share that data with one another, for fear of opening themselves up to bad press, shareholder lawsuits, etc. As a result, a lot of easily preventable attacks work against company after company after company.<p>The idea behind this bill is to create a safe way for companies to more easily share and learn, with a minimum of lag, about new attack vectors. A simple analogy might be to think of an immune system--it works best if the entire immune system goes on alert to fight each new infection (this is how vaccines work).<p>The definitions in the bill seem overly broad, and the fears are that it will be used to collect and share personal info and user-generated content.<p>These fears are legitimate, but I think it would be better to address these fears by narrowing the language rather than killing the bill.<p>It's not SOPA in disguise.
