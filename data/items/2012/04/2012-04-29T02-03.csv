I'm saying the US spends more on its military than the next ten countries put together and maintains a foreign policy of intervening in affairs of other countries and regions.

I'm saying that the current implementation does little to encourage or help people who use them to move on to something productive. I'm also saying that social security is an unsustainable pyramid scheme and that medicare is both inefficient and a poor allocation of resources.<p>I don't necessarily have solutions in mind for the latter problems; they're hard problems and not in a field with which I have experience.

3904920,comment,3904156,3904870,1,0,Mz,,,"Probably because the cultural norm is to assume that men are entitled to get laid but women are not. Such assumptions lead to uneven social outcomes which make sex far more socially problematic for women than men, for example prostitutes are typically viewed in more negative terms than johns are. It is not unusual for someone to express the idea that it is okay for a man to pay for sex but it is evil incarnate for a woman to sell it.<p>While I don't happen to agree with such views I think there are some good reasons why they exist and men who hold such views often do so out of a sense of protectiveness for women generally. But if women are to achieve equality, such things need to change. Unfortunately, idealistically protesting the supposed degradation of women basically agrees with the default cultural assumption that women are mere sex objects who get used by men and thus tends to reinforce it rather than undermine it. As a woman, I have found that whining and complaining that men should not treat women as sex objects is a really weak position to take because it respects the assumption that all the power to change things is held by men, not women. A far stronger position is to turn the tables on men and talk about them like they are sex objects for my pleasure. Edit: I mean as a form of rebuttal/to make a point. In practice -- i.e. in a relationship -- I don't think it really works for either party to be objectified.<p>Somewhat in Space Dragon's defense, I think there may be some correlation between a man liking porn and a man treating women as mere sex objects. I cannot say though which is cause and which is effect -- i.e. whether men who view women as mere sex objects are more attracted to porn or whether watching porn promotes such attitudes. I only know that men who treated me decently tended to have little interest in porn. I don't much care for it myself, though that isn't out of judgmentalism. It simply doesn't float my boat.",1335667865

Seriously?<p>Imaginary example, but real tech: Suppose I remember the first half of an Irish reel I heard somewhere, but can't remember the name or where I heard it.  In 1980, trying to track it down would involve months (maybe years) of asking every musician I met if they knew it, hunting through obscure books of music, and if I found a good solid lead, perhaps an expensive international phone call to order a recording of it from Ireland.<p>Today?  I could play the tune into an app on my phone and within seconds know its name, have multiple different sources for downloading (free) sheet music, and in another couple of minutes have purchased and downloaded multiple professional recordings of it.<p>Two things about this:
1) It's a net negative to GDP.  Before I would have spent lots of money on a phone call, a full album, and overseas shipping, now it costs me $1 to get the one track I want.  My personal consumer surplus from the new arrangement is really impressive, but the money and time I save doesn't get calculated into the economic figures these people are looking at.<p>2) The benefit is mostly to the long tail.  You've always been able to easily buy Top 40 albums pretty much wherever you were.  But now buying any genre you can imagine is easier than buying Top 40 was 32 years ago.",1335667673

It's clearly designed for a single display and trackpad gestures, where it works nicely in most cases.<p>This doesn't excuse applications (e.g., VMware Fusion, sorta-kinda, and then only in some cases, and apparently now Firefox) that are replacing their existing full-screen support that works better in other situations, alas.<p>Trouble I see is figuring out what a ""universally applicable full-screen mode"" should even look like in the possible presence of one or more displays arranged arbitrarily, each with one or more virtual desktops. For instance, on my single 27"" 16:9 display, I'd prefer browser and e-reader full screen modes with configurable left and right margins, and PDF readers that force portrait documents ONLY into 2-up, non-""continuous"" mode, in all these cases with no chrome whatsoever (even when browsing with tabs), while in VMware, I'd prefer an option to choose either Lion-style or ""classic"" full screen, as I like both for different applications. But, on the whole, imperfect as it remains, I prefer the Lion set-up to Snow Leopard's in most cases. If I ever have room on my desktop for TWO 27"" displays, I might say the opposite (and did, in fact, when I had two smaller screens rather than my current set-up).<p>And both are better than the Windows 8 preview's ""full-screen only for crippled, tablet-style applications"" model, because, e.g., I WANT Remote Desktop to stay connected in the background (to be fair, though, Windows 7 and 8 do have better built-in ""fullish screen"" window management features than any OS X version, but this is very easy to fix in OS X with either AppleScript or third-party tools).<p>Short of writing my own window manager, Web browser, etc., I'd personally be very, very hard to please all the time. Case in point: should Apple support TWO multi-touch trackpads with independent, configurable gestures? Probably not, but that didn't stop me from finding a workaround (hint: Wacom's latest tablets have gesture support).<p>Heck, I've seriously considered wiring up a MIDI pedal controller as a hyper key in Emacs, but I certainly don't expect any OS to support this out-of-the-box...",1335667361

I've certainly made a habit of hanging out with those Fat Guys, though at this point I'm in Boulder, so while they still have neck beards here, they tend to be pretty thin. Though honestly we stopped playing Settlers years ago, and have moved on to games like San Juan and Dominion. ;)<p>To tell the truth, I have a love/hate relationship with C++. Yes, I know it really well at this point. I've learned everything I know because it (at the time) was the only tool reasonable to get the job done. Now I actually avoid using it as much as possible.<p>The perfect combo for me (in games) is C++ for performant code combined with tight integration with Lua. I hear you on higher-level languages being more productive, which is why most of my game code ends up written in Lua. (I'm far from alone in using this combo -- most major iOS games seem to use the same combo, as do a lot of games in general.)<p>Why not use one of the three you mentioned? Size and speed both.<p>LuaJIT is pretty much the fastest dynamic language around, and the overhead of linking into a program is <i>tiny</i> compared to Ruby, Python, or JavaScript. The language itself gives you advanced features like coroutines with upvalues and operator overrides, but at the same time it's super-simple -- to the point where non-programmers <i>can</i> use it to script behaviors.<p>If you're doing server code you can afford to have things be a bit slower and/or huge (relatively speaking). If you're doing games downloaded OTA on a phone, and you've got a 20Mb limit before they have to use WiFi...well, size is critical (an extra megabyte or two means a lot of assets won't fit any more) and phones are far more processor-bound than most server tasks you'd use a scripting language for. On the other hand, with distributions like OpenResty [1] that hand you an extremely fast server and LuaJIT all bound up together, allowing me to create a cheap server that can handle 3000+ requests per second without barely breaking a sweat...well, since I know Lua ANYWAY, I use it on the server as well.<p>YMMV. :)<p>Addressing what you asked: C++ development is in reasonably high demand compared to the number of Fat Guys, so it tends to pay well. Having experience in a niche can also be handy -- by virtue of knowing Android C++/NDK development I've had random people contacting me to ask if I want to work for them, with no real promotion on my part. I don't even want to say what my rate was publicly, though I will say that I expected him to turn me down when I said how much I wanted.",1335667068

Ten years ago, many small-medium businesses had their own IT staff running an email server, file storage, and maybe even a little intranet site.  Many still do, but I'd guess the fraction has gone down significantly as companies slowly get comfortable moving some of their bits out of the building.  (Key word is <i>slowly</i>.)<p>But it's happening: I'm sure there are tens of thousands of HN readers who today keep their important data in hosted source code repositories, hosted accounting/invoicing packages, hosted CRM services, hosted e-mail services ... where both the software and the data do not necessarily live on their own machine.

Stephenson, who has devoted a shocking amount of time lately to learning about alternative space-launch technologies, said at MIT that the reason none of them happen turns out to be insurance.'<p>I think that the economic model and related institutions (and the social model) are actually antagonistic towards the application of technology.  I learned that mostly from Jacque Fresco and Peter Joseph et al.  I disagree with their solution in that they are talking about a centralized control system, but most of Fresco's ideas I think are correct.  He just formed his theory before the research came out on how decentralized distributed systems are more robust.<p>So I don't think you can do away with money like the ZM people suggest, BUT you do need to be aware that there are quite a few important problems with the economic model, for instance the way that automation eliminates employment and therefore the consumer base.  Look up the Zeitgeist Movement/Venus Project and you can see all of the arguments.  Where I differ is in my solution.  I think its important to automate and move away from the consumer driven infinite growth ownership/labor model but I think that once we do that, rather than centralizing and homogenizing automated systems, we just need better information distribution, common data formats and exchange.  We need to have a more unified view of the real world and to be able to easily exchange information about it holistically.  But it is crucial at the same time to allow for diverse solutions to shared problems.  That is necessary to make the system robust, allow it to evolve, keep people sane, etc.<p>I think that representative government, if it was ever really supposed to be representative, has proven to be subservient to money.  Also governments have a monopoly on force.  I see governments as entrenching moneyed power and enabling its use of force against those with less money.  Essentially money is a point system that represents power.  I don't think we want to do away with the point system, at least its a way of keeping score.  However, we do need to change the nature of money and correct the fundamental problems with belief systems such as the Social Darwinistic viewpoint held by most people.  There is no group of truly superior individuals who deserve to have vastly more wealth and control than most people, or a large group of mostly worthless humans who don't really deserve to live.  However, I really believe that most people deep down believe both of those things.  Those beliefs support the current social framework, which as I said is antagonistic towards the application of technology, as well as creating massive inequality.<p>So ""economics"" needs to become a real science by first accepting a more up-to-date non-eugenicist model of humanity and its place in the universe as well as integrating physical and social science.  This will make it much easier to apply the scientific advances we already have to solving common human problems.  Humans need hierarchy of some sort as well as a way of keeping score and satisfying primate needs etc., but you have to integrate that with physical reality and common needs.",1335665283

I think it's hard to argue that the problems IBM was solving, or those that the military solves, are really any different in that respect.
