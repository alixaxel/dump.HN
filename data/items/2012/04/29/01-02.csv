3904828,comment,3900224,3904257,3,0,ars,,,"(I assume that ""what."" is a request for an explanation.)<p>A float can store an exact integer of up to 53 bits even on a 32 bit machine.<p>PHP only has signed ints. If you need to store an unsigned int you can either store it internally as signed and only convert it to unsigned with printf() when you output it (and deal with the complexity of comparisons), or use a float and limit yourself to 53 bits.<p>If you have a 64 bit machine then of course you can easily fit an unsigned 32 bit int in that range. But it's wise not to rely on that at least for another few years.<p>In short, if you need more than 32 signed bits of range, and you want to make sure your code will run on any machine, then use a float. If you know you only use 64 bit machines then you have more flexibility. (You can use PHP_INT_SIZE and PHP_INT_MAX to check.)<p>If you need even more range than that then use the built in GMP library.<p>Also, PHP will automatically convert numbers that are too large from ints to float, so normally you don't see any of this. It's only if you use settype() to force an int that you have to pay attention to this.",1335664514

I truly appreciate it.<p>Nothing can beat psql in speed in my opinion. pgXplorer carries the overhead of a GUI of course and there is an added level of abstraction when talking to the database. pgXplorer has been built with ease-of-use in mind.<p>> ..you're asking for ""Port"" twice...<p>Sorry about it. It has been rectified at the source. I shall be updating the installers shortly.<p>> what's the proposition? Why use pgXplorer instead of pgAdmin, for example?<p>Good question. I started with the premise to supplant pgAdmin as the open source GUI tool for postgres. But I don't hold that view anymore. I am thinking of pgXplorer as another open source GUI for postgres.<p>There are several design choices that are different from pgAdmin (and possibly other database GUI tools).<p>* First of all, we have one instance of pgXplorer handling only one database at a time. So in the unpalatable event that pgXplorer crashes, it brings down only that instance. While one could launch multiple pgAdmins as well, it lists all connections regardless.<p>* A 2-D grid like layout for tables,views and function on the main canvas with search option to quickly highlight a desired item. Very useful when dealing with names in Unicode, where there can be no perceptible alphabetical order (like Japanese).<p>* The SQL editor/console is fully Unicode ready. In pgAdmin, when doing a search/replace with Unicode characters, pgAdmin's editor does not work well.<p>* Editing tables and inserting data in tables handled in a better way than pgAdmin I think. Bulk updates can be done in pgXplorer when a single column is selected.<p>* Copying and pasting data into LibreOffice Calc/Excel <i>with</i> headers. Also, it is quicker than pgAdmin.<p>* A simple table designer for newly created (columnless) tables.<p>These are some salient features of pgXplorer. More features are on the anvil.",1335664335

There are three startups that come to mind, two of which are YC alums, where at least one co-founder did not initially major in CS but picked up enough technical chops to code an awesome product.<p>I think it's difficult to learn outside a college environment - without the educational support system of peers, teachers, structure, credentialing, and student loans - it's a tough choice to try and learn how to code later AFTER you've already majored in something else. There's no guarantee that if you learn how to code on your own that you're learning properly, or efficiently, or anyone will hire you or want to co-found a startup with you. I think there's A LOT we can be doing to improve the pipeline of software developers.<p>That said, personally, I'm probably going to learn how to code and forego a joint degree in an MBA program, even though I'm 26 and two thirds done with law school.
