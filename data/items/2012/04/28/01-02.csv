IT staff in particular frequently lack any coding (scripting) skills unless they themselves are developers or Unix sysadmins.<p>2) They will have a better understanding of the web technologies they run across in their daily lives. This applies especially well to Codecademy users who learn JavaScript.\n3) Learning to code teaches you to break a problem into parts and think analytically. Our society could use more people with good critical thinking skills, we can probably all agree.<p>4) Everyone in an enterprise should have a core understanding of the elements of major functions. Yes, this means programmers should understand the very basics of finance and human resources and probably other areas that don't occur to me at the moment.<p>There are two kinds of elitism: believing that decisions should be made by the most informed and qualified individuals versus believing that those who do not belong to the ""elite"" have no business even dabbling in affairs beyond their supposed comprehension.

It certainly explains a lot about cops in America, and the US in general. You can reason with most people. But cops in America aren't reasonable, because they aren't fuckin smart enough to hear what you say, when for example you say, ""Yes, I left my driver's license in the house, which is right there, I'm just sitting in my car listening to music. Can I please go inside and get it for you?"" No - way too much to process.\nOr when you say, ""Is she under arrest, because if so I want to call her lawyer,"" and they crack you with a nightstick and chase you up Cahuenga Blvd while you're yelling at them for their badge number.\nNot that either of those things happened to me in the last ten years. But uh, fuck the police and fuck the government that chooses to arm a bunch of meatheads and send them out to lord it over citizens.\nI could tell you some stories about the cops my dad defended as a public defender, the ones from Culver City who only pulled women over to get blowjobs from them.

However, this does not allow one to use SPDY without encryption, and it does not add significant security to plain HTTP since the first request is still unencrypted.<p>After further research, while Alternate-Protocol is implemented, it appears that it might not end up being standardized due to security concerns.

I need to find a place to live in Silicon Valley that meets my needs and keeps the wife happy, and I've been having a hard time getting promising leads from Craigslist or finding other promising sources. I'm wary of using any paid sites or services unless they come heavily recommended by the community - but any recommendations you have would be greatly appreciated. If you happen to have a house you'd like to lease, I would of course love to hear from you too!<p>I'll be working in Sunnyvale, but we like the Morgan Hill area and think it'd be worth the commute. We'd like to start a lease in late June or early July. We plan on having kids and a dog in the near future - so a modest place that suits both would be best. Looking for something around $2500-$2750 a month.<p>Any recommendations, leads, or advice from the community?",1335575716
