What is the obsession with raising all of this money?<p>If your business is profitable then raising money shouldn't be a concern, especially if you have something just sitting in cyberspace with no real meatspace components bleeding cash.  Really, what the hell is this kind of money even being spent on?  Servers and staff cannot be that expensive, and few of these services I'm thinking of bother with advertising.<p>And if your business isn't profitable then why the hell is anybody investing in you?<p>Or is it more to do with capturing a share of the world's eyeballs and having an exit strategy of holding out for a strategic acquisition by a company unwilling to lose those eyeballs to a competitor, such that the amounts ""raised"" in these deals is more about establishing a stake in the final acquisition amount in exchange for giving the founders an immediate payoff?",1334494775
3843591,comment,3842905,3843521,1,0,psykotic,,,"> Not really. You can use an ITIN. IRS gives them and they are for tax tracking only.<p>I just went though trying to get an ITIN for my spouse so we could file a joint tax return. After waiting for 5 weeks, they rejected the application because we didn't attach a copy of a previous tax return--which we don't have, so it's a catch 22 if I ever saw one. I'm certain that requirement is bogus on their part, but it meant we had to file for an extension on the tax return until we could get it sorted out. If it's that much trouble when you are a legal resident, I can't imagine the process for a non-resident.",1334494653

3843558,comment,3843139,3843494,1,0,vog,,,"You are confusing ""clean rejects on SMTP level"" with ""backscatter"".<p>If your server accepts the email first, then scans it, and then decides it is spam, it's too late. Then it has only the choice between ignoring and backscatter, because it can't reliably inform the real sender - the TCP/IP connection is already closed and the email's sender is almost certainly forged.<p>However, if your server scans the email during the SMTP transfer, and rejects it with a clean error code, the sender gets a clean error message and its <i>the sender</i> who is responsible to inform the client.<p>Note that there's another downside of this approach which is why you don't find this early-reject very often in the wild: The receipient has no chance to get the email, not even by scanning their spam folder. So the sender has to understand the error message and to send a ""less spammy"" email, or he can't get in contact to the receipient at all. For some professions, this might be a no-go, as this means missing potential customers just because they use a bad email client which sends spammy-looking emails.<p>However, if you don't have this ""type"" of customers, early-rejecting on SMTP level is a perfect solution. We're using this configuration for years on our mail servers, it works pretty well and we've never, ever had to send backscatters. Yet every sender whose email was classified as spam has been correctly notified about this issue.",1334493404
