What you described is the extreme end of the spectrum that Microsoft is on.  Clearly this is a pathological case where you commit to support abuse of your API.  The alternative in this case would have been to tell Adobe not to do that earlier on.  I understand why Microsoft operates that way, and I do believe it's an admirable goal, but you don't <i>have</i> to paint yourself into this corner.  There are alternatives that are more subtle than screwing the customer.  This gray area is what the thesis of your article skips over.<p>It's still a great story though.",1334825826

They don't provide a compiler from Java to whatever bytecode Dalvik is using, but from Java bytecode to Dalvik bytecode.<p>Now I'm not saying they're doing anything illegal or in breach of any contract - I really don't know - and I don't know whether or not you could own a language in the legal sense - I have no idea about that either - but all of Google's actions seem to be in bad faith.<p>Whether or not it has any legal merit, the Java licensing was specifically meant to ensure compliant implementations. In addition, Sun didn't want other mobile implementations and tried to prevent that. Then Google went ahead, forked Java into a non-compliant implementation (and that would have been fine, too), but built their entire tool system in such a way as to allow many <i>compiled</i> Java libraries to run unmodified on an inferior JVM - sorry, a 'non-Java' VM - that they'd bought with the sole intention of circumventing Sun's licensing.<p>I don't know if Sun had a right to license Java as they did, and I don't know if Google did anything legally wrong. But what is clear that they've tried to stay as close as possible to Java (the whole platform - not just the language) without breaching the letter of the law in Sun's license. In fact, most of their technical effort was directed at precisely that - circumventing Java's licensing.<p>Now, I don't know why people are rushing for Google's defense as if they've been acting altruistically or something. Everything the did, or do, they do for profit.<p>There are no good guys in this story. There are simply two huge conglomerates in a business war. Oracle is trying to take advantage of Android's success where they've failed in the mobile arena, and Google is trying to take advantage of Java's popularity. Both companies are simply trying to exploit each other for their own benefit.<p>Whatever the legal outcome, I think both developers and consumers would benefit greatly if Android were to become a compliant Java implementation, and could take advantage of Oracle's superior VM.",1334824613

We had a 2010 MacBook Pro which had an electrical fault on the logic board which caused a fire with no possibility to remove the battery i.e. stop the short. It basically got thrown out of a second floor window into the street to stop it taking the building out.<p>Apple stuff is designed around appearance and not durability and maintenance. Metal doesn't make it good.  Lenovo particularly concentrate on the latter two. My T61 has a titanium chassis, titanium screen protection. You can throw it around and stand on it quite happily. The plastic around it protects everything from shock. My T61 has been down a flight of stairs, has been fallen on and had 2 drinks poured in it - it's fine. I can also replace ANY part inside it in about 10 mins flat. HP EliteBooks are what you are referring to - they are poorly designed like the MacBooks are and suffer failures regularly. They are a copycat machine. I cannot count the number of times my colleagues have had to take their MacBooks and MacBook Pros back to Apple for failures. None of our (35) Lenovo T-series laptops have EVER been taken out of service for maintenance or damage.<p>My T61 was made in 2007 - it's still fine. It's had memory and an SSD chucked in it (which took 5 mins each).<p>Apple hardware is for penis enthusiasts. It doesn't give you anything over a quality non-Apple laptop other than smugness.<p>Basically, your argument is based on comparing a MacBook to a shitty netbook, spending all your money on Apple love and not having enough cash left over for a Windows license which you're too cheap to pay out for.<p>Idiot.",1334824477
