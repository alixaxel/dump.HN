Those guys will kill their own family if it will get them a $5K raise.<p>I worked in the california mortgage industry before going to college. These guys would convince families living paycheck to paycheck to buy/refinance REALLY expensive homes. If they were on a 30 year fixed, we get them on an option-arm. If they are on an option-arm, we get them on a 30-year fixed.<p>This is all typical finance stuff. But here comes the kicker--they would actually outright LIE about interest rates and had a few shady notaries to back them. They would say you have a 1% interest rate (for 30 years) when it was really a 5 year option-arm and screw people. The worst part is, CA has some sort of law that protects mortgage lenders from unhappy customers after 5 years time (exactly when the 1% interest rate would fly to the market rate). Needless to say, several people left the company when we found out. Some folks reported them to the BBB--I don't know what happened to those scumbags though.

I'm 5 months into GWT/GAE, not counting preliminary research/learning, and am only now starting to see a return on my time investment. Looking back, I'm glad I decided to roll my own small framework for GWT/GAE; everything else just seemed inflexible, overkill, and too proprietary. I recommend taking a look at <a href=""http://www.gwtapps.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gwtapps.com/</a> which has been very helpful through my journey, even if it's somewhat dated.<p>There's practically zero support for Maven in the GWT documentation, and it's a shame because it seems much more elegant than just Ant. Ant is probably what I hate most about GWT, but beyond the initial setup, I haven't dealt with it much other than simply running ""ant build"" and ""ant devmode"".<p>My honest advice is unless you really like working with Java or are already past the learning curve, just go the HTML5, Backbone.js, Bootstrap/LESS, and Coffeescript route. GWT's worth the investment but the web standards it's built on will still leak through on sufficiently complex projects. Also, I couldn't see myself doing GWT if I wasn't also doing Java GAE, because GWT-RPC makes AJAX so painless.",1333423591
3791311,comment,3790378,3791011,3,0,fudged,,,"<i>I think the hatred for Facebook [...] has waned and people like it again.</i><p>I think that there are a couple important reasons for this. Google+, a big alternative to Facebook, wasn't a viable option for most people, so they recognized the comfort of Facebook's features. Also, Facebook implemented a bunch of new features that made Facebook more lively (friend lists, timeline, ticker, etc.).<p>Google had a great opportunity, but they really missed out. Games could have been a great factor in getting more users, but I think that the fundamental issue lies with the actual sharing and interaction mechanisms! Not being able to write on someone's profile was a huge mistake for familiarizing Facebook users with the site, and getting new users. The circling and filtering behaviors still haven't changed. Pinterest came along and did sharing the right way: users posting categories of posts that other people can choose to voluntarily follow. Google+ isn't useful to me because the signal/noise ratio is through the roof because of this fundamental flaw. And there is <i>still</i> no way to exclude individuals from seeing a post.<p>In many ways, Pinterest is wiping the floor with Google+... an actual content-sharing network, with a well-designed intuitive sharing mechanism. An actual companion to Facebook rather than competitor. Making people choose between the two  (Google+/Facebook) was far too large of a challenge.",1333423580

3791303,comment,3781035,3791181,1,0,nessus42,,,"So??? This is how things work in Clojure. And that's just fine.<p>I guess I just don't understand where you are coming from. It's been pointed out to you that Clojure hackers don't mind importing the generic functions. You replied that then your worry is that it would be hard to preserve type information in a statically typed language that works like Clojure. I mentioned that Cecil is statically typed and preserves type information, with a multi-method system that is somewhat similar to Clojure's. At least as I understand it.<p>If your entire worry is that you have to import every generic function you want to use, then I guess you and I just don't worry about the same things at all. To me, importing the functions that you use is a <i>feature</i>, not a bug! In fact, when I program in Python, I generally program a lot more with functions than with classes, and yes, in every module I explicitly import every single externally defined function that that module needs. Again, I consider this a feature, not a bug.<p>What I <i>would</i> object to is having to explicitly import all the method <i>definitions</i> that implement the generic functions used in a multi-method system. That would be insanity, but that's a moot point, as that is never required, as far as I am aware.<p>Also, common generic functions, however, such as map(), could clearly be automatically imported by the language. E.g., in Predef in Scala, or in built-ins in Python. In fact, in Python, map() is in built-ins, and you don't have to import it. Though, in Python's case, map() doesn't preserve the original container type",1333423449

I'd like to reproduce it here as a way of flagging it for people who might not otherwise read the entire thing:<p><i>My approach to writing software is embarrassingly unstructured. I'm not sure I can claim to have something that merits the term 'workflow'. One thing that is very important for me, and that, had I figured it out earlier, would probably have saved some past projects from dying, is to never have a system in a half-refactored, non-functional state for longer than an hour or so. A lot of momentum and motivation comes from having a working program in front of me. This sometimes means I have to split up big changes in a number of more indirect, trivial steps, and resist the temptation to start hammering out my big change in one go (which, even when seems straightforward in my head, will always hit some complications during implementation).</i><p><i>Also, really learning git in depth has had a big influence on how I code. Once you really understand that changes (if you bother to commit often and with care) can be reverted and picked at will, and that branches are cheap and easy to create and maintain, you start to see a codebase differently. I often take multiple shots at making a tricky change  if it feels like my first approach is not working out, I simply commit it, back up, and start again, knowing that if the new approach doesn't work out, I can simply flip back to the old one again. Knowing that this is theoretically possible is not enoughyou need to have actually done it, often, to start applying it properly.</i>",1333422598
