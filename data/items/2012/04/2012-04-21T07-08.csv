I've not touched C++ in 10.  This is a good thing, but I do remember saying the same thing about Java about hiding memory details.

Apparently SVG performance degrades as you increase the number of objects but it can handle changes in scale (zooming in for instance) much better than Canvas can.  It seems you've gone with SVG (Raphael) for all your rendering.  Have you seen any performance degradation in your tests?",1334992452

3871187,comment,3871053,3871145,7,0,drostie,,,"Well, that can to some extent be expected -- trying to describe a progressive taxation algorithm can be much more messy than just saying, ""here, look it up.""<p>There are much more important WTFs. For example, there are two different tax rates which you might be paying -- one for capital gains and certain dividends, and one for income. The first is always taxed at a lower rate. Meanwhile, you have a ""deduction"" -- an amount of money that you're allowed to deduct from your return as if you'd never gotten it in the first place.<p>The IRS forms actually implement a worksheet which just says, ""subtract your deduction from your income, and if your deduction is larger than your income, subtract whatever else there is from your capital gains.""<p>At least, I <i>think</i> that's what it does. As this article shows, you have no conscious idea what the heck you're <i>really</i> doing when the IRS invites you to play Turing Machine.",1334992117

For example, the styling of the entire second line of a submission (below the title) uses the same color, font, font-size, lowercase-type, and spacing throughout.<p>It's also nice that all of the relevant information for a submission is contained in that second line -- # of points, username, submission time, # of comments.",1334991990
