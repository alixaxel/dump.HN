Contractors have to pay for their own equipment, supplies, business taxes, licenses, etc.  For example, as a freelancer I pay almost twice the federal FICA tax rate of a salaried worker.  Plus, I have to take out unpaid time for marketing, and sometimes, even if you're good, you'll find yourself with a week or two of unexpected (and unpaid) vacation.  Contract workers have to plan and budget for all of that.  So yes, it's below the going rate for experienced developers in any part of the country here in the US.  It's way below the going rate for developers with 5 years of experience.  I think LibriVox is smart to lower the amount of experience they are requiring -- they'll likely end up with a better developer because of it (although there are no guarantees at below market rates).",1333767593

By data integrity, I mean trustworthiness which implies security, meaning file content hasn't been modified in-storage or in-transit. I'm guessing you are using those words to mean protection against transport-errors or typos (credit card entry) for which checksum is commonly used.<p>Given that HTTP is still the most common transport for file download and it's a reliable transport, file-hashing for transport-errors detection is I think meaningless. I know some browsers failed to report errors but comparing length is typically suffice to catch this.<p>That leaves only file-hashing as protection against tempering in-storage or in-transit which is why I am saying it's security-related.

Is social media in general or Facebook in particular more likely to promote ""groupthink"" and ""civic rot"" than older forms of media? How can we confirm or disprove this hypothesis?

As innocent as summer camps are, they violate far more freedoms than Facebook. Attendance is compulsory, and as you pointed out, your freedom of speech and ability to dissent as an atheist was denied.<p>I believe we share the same concerns regarding groupthink and authoritarianism. I also enjoyed your prior allusion to Orwell. But like Orwell, I believe the most harm comes from imprecision in the meaning of language. I do not believe your definition of 'freedom' and 'heinous violation of freedom' allows one to differentiate between the acts of Facebook and the acts of full blown authoritarian governments with camps. That is, I believe your method of reasoning will actually make it harder for people to identify institutions that fall into the later category, which is why I posed the question as to whether this disservices those who have suffered under such institutions.<p>The alternate definition of freedom I proposed was that of John Locke. He used it to derive a principle in Two Treatises on Government for detecting when governance is illegitimate and may be overthrown. I believe adopting such a position regarding freedom will help further your goal of opposing authoritarian groupthink more so than your current method and organizational target.",1333765644

No problems, just ran their little diagnostics (or tried to, the machine just wouldn't boot anymore).<p>They ended up shipping it off, came back as good as new besides the screen being off (there was a line going down the middle now that wasn't there before) that would show up sometimes when you would tilt the screen a certain angle (no, I wasn't trying to bend it too far). Sent it out again, got it back, brand new screen.<p>Yes, being without it twice kinda sucked, but it was my secondary machine. In the end Apple fixed everything that was wrong with it long after the warranty ended.<p>Now, one thing I would say is that all of my laptops always get checked in under my personal business name, so each time I get a ""Apple's business department is here for your business"" spiel and a business card attached for when I want to upgrade.<p>Couldn't be more happy with Apple, I have been extremely satisfied with my purchases to date and enjoy using their products daily.",1333765078

3809733,comment,3809421,3809421,2,0,mindcrime,,,"I basically feel the same way as @AaronKlein, per his comment at the parent blog:<p><i>I have a few reserve prices in my mind, and they're based on getting to specific milestones. So if somebody wanted to buy the company at this stage (primarily for its technology), that's a lower price than I'd accept when we get to a certain level of user traction.</i><p>I mean, if somebody wanted to buy Fogbeam Labs today, I think we might sell for, say, ~$1 million.  All a buyer would be getting at this point would be the founders, for some reasonable lock-up period, a product that's maybe 3/4's of the way to being a shipping (albeit beta) product, and some customer development research.<p>But by, say, a year from now, I hope (and expect) to be able to say ""we wouldn't sell for less than ~$50 million.""  If we have a shipping product and some traction to prove our hypotheses by then, that would change a lot.<p>And given the market we're in, and the valuations of other firms that do related types of products, and some of the projects I've seen from Gartner and their ilk, I believe that - if we are successful - we're building a company that will be worth hundreds of millions (or more) eventually.  I mean, we're thinking IPO here, not ""let's get acquired by $WHOEVER in a talent acquisition.""  In fact, because that is the goal, and because we're brash and self-confident, I don't <i>know</i> that we would actually sell for $1 million today, even though there's no objective criteria on which to base such a valuation.  It's more a question of our own belief in where we're going, and what heights we can ultimately hit.  But that's counterbalanced by the fact that none of us are rich currently, and the idea of walking away with even a few hundred thousand to deposit in the bank, would be awfully, awfully tempting.<p>So yeah, timing and what we can prove to ourselves in terms of feedback and traction, will have a huge impact on the actual number *at any specific point in time.""  But, at least we know where we're aiming, so we have some basis to ground our decision making.",1333764904
3809732,comment,3808194,3809338,8,0,evincarofautumn,,,"Id tend to agree. The powerful metaprogramming features of Lisp are often unnecessary in day-to-day code, and definitely overhyped. Its poor form to use a macro when something simpler will do. Theyre just another tool, and when you need them its great to have them, but do all projects demand <i>the</i> most powerful language features? Hardly.<p>However, Im also with the author in that there are obvious social issues arising from the existence of many implementations. If I write in C (or even C++) using standard libraries, then I can be reasonably assured that my code will compile anywhere. For obvious reasons, thats not the case with Lisp dialects despite their superficial similarities, but I think that catches many neophytes off guard.<p>So even if such detrimental personality traits arent peculiar to Lispers, there is a strong apparent correlation because of the fractured community. Still, I think that has less to do with the power of the language and more to do with its simplicity and lack of BDFL. Anybody can make their own Lisp, their own object system, and no one will objectno pun intended.",1333764887

Congratulations for getting into such highly ranked schools!<p>That said, in terms of CS, I think Stanford is the clear winner in terms of name brand.

I don't think Harvard's a much better school in non-CS areas than Stanford, and Stanford is generally regarded as a better school than Harvard in CS. If you decide that you really want to learn about field X, and Harvard is much better in X than Stanford, then that might be a compelling argument the other way.
