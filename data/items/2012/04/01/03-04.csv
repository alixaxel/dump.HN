Smaller teams tend to be the most successful at breaking large problems up into smaller, shippable chunks. Also, they can minimize the distractions by controlling their own space.<p>If an individual needs private time, I think a generous work-from-home policy can do wonders. Give a person 2 days of the week to work from home and let the team self manage time in/out of the office. Letting the team work out scheduling helps them maximize productivity with <i>both</i> group-think and individual contributions.",1333252718

Anyhow, the rates they gave were horrible but like any loan you have the ability to pay it off in the near future.  Sometimes this can be used to get a better price on the vehicle by making the dealership think they are going to make a lot of money on the loan in the long run when in fact you are actually just going to pay it off or refinance it in a few months (some deals state that you can't refinance for like 2 months or something from my understanding).<p>This process doesn't always work though because it involves more more people dealing with your loan, of which each of them usually cost some small amount of money.",1333252332

And, you should be obligated to post a reason.  And, if the reason is bullshit and it gets downvoted, you loose another 10% of your points.<p>In other words, it better be valid.<p>The rules could be a little more elaborate than that, but this might be a good start.",1333252154

It's hard to play devil's advocate sometimes because unless you are going for the ""conventional wisdom"" some people are bound to disagree with you, and disagreement is often expressed in the form of downvotes. Since offering a different point of view is discouraged, the discussion inevitably trends towards being bland or rah-rah in nature.<p>What to do? The wise solution is to just ignore Karma -- who cares about that except for the egomaniacs? But the truth is that we are all human, and when I offer something that adds to the discussion but got downvoted to oblivion in return, it hurts, at least sometimes.

3782537,story,,,2,2,bestsignal,"Hey HN, I am looking for feedback",,"I have put my first Android application on the market and I am interested in receiving some feedback.  I hope to grow the application and make it great over time, but I want to do so based on what the customer would like, not what I think they would like.<p>The application is called BestSignal and it currently has two main functions.  The first function is to give users control over when their phone switches between Wifi and cellular signals based on their respective strengths.  Many of us have experienced the situation where our phone hangs onto a wifi connection that is down to one bar even though we have 3 or 4 bars of a 3G or 4G connection.  Now you can change that!  For example, if you want to switch while Wifi is still two bars strong as long as cellular has 3 bars, then simply set the values with our easy-to-use interface and your done!<p>The second function is that BestSignal gives users the ability to monitor their cellular data usage in order to avoid those costly overage charges at the end of their billing cycle!  We even allow you to set a warning level so you can be notified that you are getting close to you data limit.<p>There are a number of other conveniences BestSignal offers, including configuring connections to open networks, deciding if you want to ignore 2G networks when dropping Wifi, and giving quick access to battery-saving toggles (e.g. activating airplane mode or turning on/off your Wifi radio).<p>My ultimate goal is to make the application a go-to place to help users manage their data needs.  Please let me know what you think of the application (either by commenting here, or through the ""Contact BestSignal"" button in the application) and I will work towards improving the application.  Thank you for taking the time to check out BestSignal!<p>Google Play:\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eightythirty.bestsignal<p>Amazon:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Best-Signal-LLC-BestSignal/dp/B007QEIHEE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1333247460&sr=8-1",1333250486

Even after Mason blogged that there was no need to sue Groupon for violating state expiring-gift-card laws, because people with expired groupons could always just use 'the Groupon Promise' for a refund, Groupon refuses to give refunds on expired groupons.<p>That may save them a bit on refunds, but it creates  pissed-off customers who won't be fooled again. I'd bought 4 groupons before I discovered the Groupon Promise was a lie, and none since.<p>(And I don't mind companies having tough return policies if that's what's required in their particular business.
