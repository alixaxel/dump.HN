Abstract:<p>""\"""\nTasks that involve large information spaces overwhelm workspaces that do not support efficient use of space and time. For example, case studies indicate that information often contains linear components, which can result in 2D layouts with wide, inefficient aspect rations. This paper describes a technique called Perspective Wall for visualizing linear information by smoothly integrating detailed and contextual views. It uses hardware support for 3D interactive animation to fold wide 2D layouts into intuitive 3D visualizations that have a center panel for detail and two perspective panels for context. The resulting visualization supports efficient use of space and time.\n""\"""<p>PDF: <a href=""http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/uir/publications/items/UIR-1991-03-Mackinlay-CHI91-PerspectiveWall.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.parc.com/istl/projects/uir/publications/items/UI...</a>",1333254831

Since disks, like CPUs today, were binned, you could often use the ""bad"" side anyway, as the failure rates went down on the production runs.<p>- That side didn't have a dust filter, or whatever you call those little felt pads.<p>- If it DID have a dust filter, it might have been in a position to catch the dust on a true double-sided drive, which would be spinning in the opposite direction, and so would end up being useless to you.<p>- Or, worse, if the pad was napped, like velour, spinning in the opposite direction would actually <i>release</i> all the dust that had been captured.

If the parent of a student was able to see this picture then it's hard to consider her Facebook profile private.  If they had a screen shot of this photo on Facebook I doubt they would require her password to suspend her.<p>That being said I still think it is horrid that anyone would even think of asking for a Facebook password, and the ""guilty until proven innocent"" thing doesn't fly with me.",1333252935

Other is they open themselves up to other dealers quoting a price that they won't hold once you arrive at the dealer. And then that dealer gets a chance to close them (after bullshitting their way out of the lie).<p>That said I've bought several cars by phone and have received prices by email but get the best deals in person. That way you are dangling a sale in front of them and they tend not to want you to walk out the door and go elsewhere.<p>In sales the more time somebody invests (either buyer or seller) the less likely they are to walk away from something.",1333252868
