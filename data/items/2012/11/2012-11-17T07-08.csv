4797581,comment,4797036,4797469,3,0,smsm42,,,"More amusingly, the standard complaint in this setup is the disproportionate power which the small parties wield - since it is often necessary for the larger parties to form coalitions with the smaller ones, and the smaller ones, catering to specific niches, are not accountable to larger electorate and thus are not afraid to offend it by openly extorting the larger parties. The second complaint is an inherent instability of such system - as soon as smaller ones are paid, or as soon as larger ones are unable to keep paying (paying doesn't have to be money, of course - can be policies, appointments, etc.) the coalition breaks down and the shopping season starts again.<p>I'm not sure which one is the better - having only two choices which are roughly equally bad or having multiple choices two of which are equally bad and then also must buy the votes of the choices which are even worse.",1353139127

For the moment, I don't care if you believe in it or not: just take it as a given, because something like that is certainly physically possible.<p>Let's say for years many countries polluted the atmosphere with CO2. Over time, it substantially changes the planet's climate and causes untold trillions of dollars of damage to billions of people.<p>How do torts handle this? For one, who does the suing? Do we allow class action lawsuits with billions of people? What about countries that don't allow class action lawsuits?<p>What if one heavily-polluting country has for years funded propaganda opposing accurate science, and when chickens come home to roost it still insists that carbon emissions had nothing to do with warming climate? What if the legal system refuses the huge payoffs that would be required? What if the will happens to be there but the country just can't afford to pay for the damages it caused?<p>Is it even fair to levy taxes or fines on people to pay for something that's been going on for generations? After all, why should our descendants be forced to suffer because of our present day callousness and shortsightedness?<p>Should people who benefited from climate change be forced to pay more? How does one deal with the fact that everyone, to varying extents, helped cause it? Is it only people who were totally off the grid and carbon free who should get to receive compensatory payouts?",1353139080

Interestingly, there are quite a few people who answered that their neighborhood had too many trees, but the city as a whole had about the right number.  Makes me wonder if this is speaking about ""fairness"" rather than actual tree preferences.<p>The statistical testing is tricky, though.  Did you go in with the thesis that there might be a correlation between age and ideal number of trees, or did you first pin down ""too many trees"" and then search the data for correlation?  Or even more problematically, did you search for cross-correlations on all columns and then discover the age-tree link?

We have outrage/indignation/us-vs-them magnifiers like Twitter and social news. More issues are discussed  and political affiliations chosen  nationally.<p>At the level of the casual observer/participant (and the 'marginal voter), I think that's led to unhelpful dimensionality reduction, into coarser and more childlike political categories. And that's especially dragged down the Republican national brand, because for several reasons (including less sympathy in the media) their most-embarrassing regional characters do more damage elsewhere than those of the Democrats.<p>So the devolution to more than 2 brands I mentioned wouldn't mean a real enduring 'third party'  I agree, the US system is rigged against that. Rather, it'd be getting away from the national 'Democrat' and 'Republican' names when they're unhelpful oversimplifications, perhaps via differently-named, and more doctrinally varied, regional affiliates... a little like the 20th-Century General Motors model of many brands.",1353138150

4797551,comment,4796289,4797332,4,0,scarmig,,,"Well, who's giving the State its legitimacy right now?<p>It's not some god in the sky that does. We do: not just a generic we, but most people reading this, you and me included. We choose to participate in the markets it establishes; it tells us what property rights are and says they're property rights because it says so and has the guns to back them up. The corporations we work for rely on it to break down people's doors when someone gets ahold of a next gen device that they misplaced, and we feel safe that the money we put into our banks is safe for us because the State will yell at the bank if it takes our money and pay for it if the bank loses it.<p>There's no reason a protection agency wouldn't do the same to establish its own legitimacy. It seems like a good business model, in fact: convince everyone that questioning it is morally bad, create some ideal of ""citizenship"" that amounts to brand loyalty to violence, and then expropriate value from a populace that's not only cowed but actively consenting.<p>Don't get me wrong: it gets my goat as much as yours that that's the situation. But I wasn't describing before how a hypothetical, ahistoric government-like entity might develop: I was offering a general theory of how it actually did. If it's right, the State isn't some aberration but an emergent, self organizing maelstrom that has gradually grown to envelope virtually all people in all places.<p>My issue with libertarianism as it exists in popular culture is that its idea of liberation seems to be getting the State to deign to rewrite property rights to privilege one part of society instead of the current one (that's all of electoral politics, actually). Once that's achieved, one gathers, we can all become happy and free consumers because a certain property right regime has become the law of the land, imposed from above by our now-purified and almighty State.",1353137983

Or, if going public isn't an option, often the estate needs to sell the business to a larger corporation.<p>End result is, these smaller $5 - $20 million dollar corporations disappear when the founder dies and they morph into bigger, lifeless enterprises.

We are learning to recognize trends and non-trends based on previous examples. Since the Twitter trends algorithm gives us such examples, you could say we are learning to replicate the outputs of an arbitrary algorithm --- and you'd be right. But learning from examples is a very general thing, so the method has applications beyond detecting trending topics.<p><i>Are they modeling some inherent process of topics becoming popular</i><p>No, we don't model the process of something becoming popular. (To do this, one might suppose people spread popular topics in X way and unpopular topics in Y way, and try to estimate from the data whether the topic is popular or unpopular.) The beauty of this is that we never have to build a model, because we rely directly on the data. As a corollary, this approach is applicable out of the box for any domain with time-varying data (though I suppose you might have to take care to measure the right kind of time varying data).<p>Does that answer your question?",1353137543

A large portion of corporations have custom built webapps to provide basic services like HR, Payroll, etc. and they rely on IE to provide consistent behavior for these services.<p>Should they update their apps? Probably, but it costs money to build systems like that and most corporations don't want to drop money on something that already works perfectly fine.<p>Adopting webkit would completely disrupt all of these services, and Microsoft would basically destroy its customer base/relations.<p>Alternatively, Chrome is about pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web. It's great for new companies, startups, and small developers, but as they move fast and implement new standards / functionality they also break stuff, and unlike Microsoft it doesn't really matter to the webkit dev team if a certain medium size corporation's old payroll app no longer works because of the latest chrome update.<p>Different browsers serve different purposes, and IE's is to provide stability. Hence they don't adopt webkit.<p>(I was an intern with IE this past summer and I asked the very same question minus the last part to my manager, and this was his response)",1353137189

I ask, because the term makes me think of people with no conceivable prospects who are essentially being sustained out of pity.<p>However, it is probably fair to draw a distinction between programs like Section 8 housing and food stamps (which probably total less than $30B), and the universe of all means-tested programs.<p>Increasing the talent pool is vital to producing a dynamic economy. It sounds touchy-feely, but things like school lunch programs are an enormous success when judged on the basis of their effect on childhood development, and the resulting increase in greater eventual intelligence, educational attainment, and productivity. Regardless of whether people have contempt for their parents, or pity that some people may simply have worse luck than others, something as boring as one healthy meal five days a week for nine months of the year has measurable effects on cognitive development for people who didn't choose their parents. The same goes for programs like subsidized preschool education, programs that educate young parents who didn't learn how to nurture from their parents, and many other small programs that are likely to sound very boring and very futile, but effect real incremental change that ultimately benefits the entire economy more than the individual beneficiaries.<p>On the other end of means tested programs from those that encourage talent pool development, are the social safety net programs that facilitate enterprising risk. Early in the nation's history for example the perfectly justifiable idea of debtors' prisons was abolished for the more pragmatic practice of bankruptcy protection. More modern programs make it increasingly possible for not only young single people to go all in on a startup, but people with families, with less risk that a failure will put their children on the street. That doesn't mean that people shouldn't work on savings, but that they can take an even bolder risk when worth it. It may be logical to argue that they should suffer the consequences of their risk, but the economy probably experiences a net benefit from encouraging people away from their biases toward playing it safe.<p>I get that social programs are really boring, especially since they tend to be top-down organized and not very entrepreneurial, yet it isn't accurate either to assume that they are all over-sentimental and based on pity alone, or that they all ultimately end up undermining people's chances of standing on their own feet.",1353136002
