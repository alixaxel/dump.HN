4761833,comment,4759620,4761766,1,0,bobwaycott,,,"You erroneously conclude I think I am the first person to think of this. I do not. I know my sci-fi <i>and</i> biblical and human history (20 years of studying intellectual and cultural history, thank you). I've read about the tower of babel and grew up on wanting universal translators.<p>My comment was a bit of bittersweet admiration at a very <i>specific</i> success in implementation. Can we just assume that the average person on HN knows wtf a universal translator is, and not every time someone says, ""I had this very idea"" that they are making accusations that company/person X is stealing the idea away? Christ. Not a single word was spoken that this idea was ""stolen"" or ""grabbed away"". Nor were words employed signifying that ""I thought of this first and completely independently"".<p>I was saying it looks like it's too late to be the person who gets to be first to demonstrate it. And by ""very idea"" I meant, <i>quite specifically</i>, how cool it would be to be able to translate my voice into another language in near-real-time. And by ""Rats"", I meant ""Oh snap, looks like others have been working on doing that same thing and impressively pulled the damn thing off.""<p>If you spent a moment looking at my comment history, you'd see I am usually quite clear in stating what I mean directly. Had I meant to imply an idea was ""grabbed away from [me] before I could create a startup"", I'd have used those <i>exact</i> words. Instead, I said that I'd had this very idea years ago and only recently thought about how the tech might be there today to make it happen, and maybe make for an interesting startup. I didn't even try to imply it would be <i>my</i> startup.<p>Nonetheless, point taken. I'll ensure I more specifically couch any future statements about having ideas with the qualifier that I am, in fact, <i>not</i> implying that I had it first or independently in the whole of human history.",1352447503

They should have nothing stopping them from voting if they want to, and nothing artificially pushing them towards doing so either.<p>The big problem in America with voting is that election day is not a national holiday.  If there should be any incentive to vote, there should be fines for employers who don't give election day off (not saying people cant' elect to work that day, but it <i>needs</i> to be a default holiday), or a mandated pay hike to employees working election day (say, doctors, police, utilities workers, etc that can't really have a day off).<p>But absolutely don't mandate individuals vote.  Its their right not to.  You don't get to go around telling other people how to behave if it doesn't negative impact you.  And the people not voting now won't become more inclined to get involved because they are <i>forced</i> to, in the same way children aren't intellectually stimulated by being forced to go to public schools.",1352447320

4761822,comment,4760995,4761616,10,0,btilly,,,"<i>>Not when the majority of jobs that create a vibrant middle class in the post-industrial United States require at least a college degree.</i><p><i>That's a self-refuting argument. If your degree was really the ticket to a ""vibrant middle class"" job you'd be able to pay off your student debt.</i><p>You just failed at basic logic.<p>Saying that jobs of type X require a degree IS NOT saying that getting a degree guarantees that you will get a job of type X.  As an example, a law degree is required to become a lawyer.  But only something like 70% of people graduating with law degrees will pass the bar, and be put on a track to a job where they can reasonably expect to pay back their debts.<p>I also see that you are happy to blame the victim.  Yet many victims are not to blame.  Let me take a real example, my wife.  She got an MD.  She went into residency.  She got injured, had to take time off then leave residency.  She is in another residency now.  She still does not make enough to contribute towards her debts, I've been doing it instead.<p>She did nothing wrong.  Yes, the degree was expensive, but an MD is generally a worthwhile investment.  Yes, she got injured.  But that was not her fault.  There are no guarantees in life.  Bad luck will happen to a certain fraction of people.  It happened to her.<p>Now you have a lot to say about planning.  Well back when she took on that debt, bankruptcy could discharge it.  It was not until after she had the MD that the rules changed on her.  Thanks to me, she's not in trouble.  But when she took on the debt, the bank agreed to one set of risks, and then Congress changed the terms of the contract out from under her later.  In what world is it fair that you sign one thing, and then because the right politicians got bribed, you're bound to a different thing?",1352447298

I don't see what's entitled about giving one's own time or money to a cause you believe in, to go camp out for weeks or whatever. It seems like a lot of criticism of OWS centers on them acting like they deserve to be given jobs, but I have trouble taking this seriously when the same pundits complain about slow growth in their stocks/financials due to decreased consumer spending and unemployment, and want to know what the government's going to do about it.<p>- Civil liberties and free speech are supposed to be the cornerstone of American democracy and yada yada, but people suddenly feel extremely threatened when people want to exercise them. Who cares, let the hippies have their say and their signs. Why let it bother you?<p>- Loan forgiveness, bank bailouts. This is the one that really annoys me because criticisms of OWS on this front tend to be so inconsistent. If a student gets over their head in debt trying to earn a degree, we shouldn't think of helping her out because that's a terrible case of moral hazard, and we'll only encourage that sort of risk-taking behavior. But if bank executives commit fraud and bet against their customers, then get multi-billion bailouts for their companies and multi-million severance checks for themselves, well, you know how business is, these things just happen, there's no help for it.<p>Anyway sorry for the rant, but I just think if you disagree with what OWS proposes, you should make an argument against it (or even better, just ignore it) rather than resorting to personal attacks or condescending catchphrases like ""entitlement"".",1352446702
