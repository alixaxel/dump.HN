4824576,comment,4824292,4824339,3,0,Dn_Ab,,,"It almost certainly is. You can consider it from a logical perspective without even going into brain science.<p>When a computer looks at a scene it sees in terms of learned rules or operations on high dimensional elements of a vector space intended to cluster pixels.<p>Scenes have semantics. When we see a scene we see not just things regardless of color or orientation but That thing BY a thing ON TOP of that other thing. We use not just co-occurence patterns of blobs of pixels but context. No doubt context rules can be brute forced by looking at statistics of large amount of images. But it can be more readily learned by a system with a good language model and rules expressed in terms of it.<p>Language is more important than vision for making sense of the world.<p>You can also look at it in terms of the brain. That the parts related to sensory integration and processing are also key to language. And that those sections activate as a coprocessor not a single processor.<p>There is a part of the brain called the Temporal lobe. The Temporal lobe processes audio, speech and semantics. A section of that, intersecting the parietal lobe (linked to visuospatial integration, symbols, math ability), is the Superior temporal sulcus. It is identified as key in theory of mind, processing motion, social cues, faces as well as integrating audio and visual information. What's interesting is that it shows task related activation. It doesn't do all these things alone but activates differently in conjunction with what networks are currently active.<p>Recently a paper also made a strong argument that the STS is a part of brain that interprets stimuli specifically, regardless of modality (sound, visual) obviously key to recognizing objects.<p><a href=""http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/47/16629.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jneurosci.org/content/32/47/16629.abstract</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporoparietal_junction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporoparietal_junction</a><p><a href=""http://www.indiana.edu/~panlab/papers/SraJtw_inverse.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.indiana.edu/~panlab/papers/SraJtw_inverse.pdf</a>",1353732679

4824574,comment,4824410,4824410,10,0,meepmorp,,,"I've seen app load times this bad before (longer, actually, in the 15-20 min. range), on a VB6 fat client app that hit a central network db server.<p>This was actually indended to be an improvement. The app was meant to replace an existing point of sale system in a national chain of stores, but because the app was purchased by executives which no real understanding of what they were getting (and who browbeat anyone who tried to raise warning flags as being protective of their own fiefdoms) it had some architectural/programming warts which made it doomed to fail.<p>For example, all clients were to use a central database, located at company HQ, typically over 128kbps links. The legacy system used servers in each store, with sales and inventory data being passed up incrementally, so the slow links weren't an issue. And the code base was terrible - littered with select * over tables with hundreds of columns just to fetch a couple fields. Because development had been so haphazard on the app, nobody wanted to remove fields from the db, just in case they were used someplace. And these selects happend all the time, like when you'd click a UI item and it'd fetch the relevant data on demand to populate stuff. There were tons of other issues, too - like being unable to handle most transactions without the network and db being available, integrity issues, etc. It was a mess.<p>So, once it became clear that the app was gonna fall over entirely on deployment to more than about 10 clients, panic mode set in. After some guessing, the developers decided to cache data on startup. Hence the slow as fuck startup times as each client performed thousands of selects of hundreds of fields to get enough data to run. It actually helped, somewhat, though all of the other issues were enough to utterly doom the app and get the executive (CFO, I think) who bought it shown the door. A major US consulting firm came in and replaced it, costing craploads but actually delivering something usable.",1353732614

Which is cool, and useful for a lot of stuff. But the version of Rhino you can use on Dalvik has all of the bytecode generation disabled (obviously) and as a consequence, it can't emit the necessary bytecode to create the interface-fulfilling Java wrapper to make the JS object do what you want. It's generally bogus.<p>Also it's really hard to express how much slower Dalvik is than HotSpot in the general case, too.

Crappy code can still get a lot of stars/forks and great code can pretty much get ignored if it's not the flavor of the month with the majority bandwagon. I think Github is great if you want to look at someone's code, but being able to successfully answer questions, while more academic than utilitarian, in general identifies those with a deep and thorough understanding of the technology. SO gets gamed though.<p>Ultimately, I suppose that either are a good bet if you're looking for someone who stands out in a certain way. In both places you should vet the quality of the code or quality of the answers. And if you're the type of employer who uses these as metrics for rating candidates, then I think you should also probably give your employees time to work on their Github projects/SO profiles (I didn't intend the irony there, but it's there all the same).",1353730235

There are thousands of websites that gain either significant viewership (and thus expense) or require significant time investments whereby online advertising makes the effort worth it for those involved. If ""ad blocking"" and ""do not track"" increase in popularity, the independent web will be in serious jeopardy. As a publisher of one such site, I know first hand.<p>And beyond just those important websites that provide thought and opinion which may be contrary to the ""mainstream,"" are a host of other pure information sites on cooking, building, etc. that many of us find useful from time to tim.<p>And extending further, the massive ecosystem of hosting companies and their employees would also be at risk if their clients are no longer able to pay bills.<p>The unintended consequences of stifling the only currently viable revenue model for thousands of websites is far reaching.<p>Yes.

In terms of billable time, if the client doesn't want to pay for better performance, then it's hard to argue in favor of spending any effort fixing that.<p>It does kind of present an opportunity too. If you can have a long term relationship with this customer, then you can roll out subsequent versions in which you fix a little bit of what's wrong with the startup time in each version.
