So did median household income. The shift was primarily due to trade liberalization. The recent recession decimated jobs across many fields, as you'd expect from a drop of jobs due to flagging demand (driven by pressure towards deleveraging, not unexpected given high personal debt to GDP ratios).<p>So automation isn't displacing workers yet, other factors are. If the automation dystopia hasn't even begun, how do we know it's starting? We go on a hunch, and say technology will probably displace all jobs at some point in the future, maybe five years from now on no evidence, because it feels right?<p>Will new jobs and new sectors always replace the old? All of economic history suggests yes. Armchair speculation suggests no.<p>Go with whatever your gut tells you, and forgive me for opting for a more conservative reliance on metrics.

(Were a small startup at the time launching our little game and it didnt go well at all after a 2 hard-working year, about the same time when Glitch launched).<p>2. Its the Flickrs founding dream to create this, and if you read the backstory of Flickr, youll notice that the founder initially wanted to create this startup before Flickr, but found out it is not feasbible, and took out a main component from the game (sharing photo) and built Flickr. And so now, the founder has sold her company to Yahoo!, and decided to use every penny to make her dream come true, and it appears reality hits where it hurts the most, and the game didnt fly. I tried the game, its really polished, but it just didnt have the target market pool as big as Zynga in Facebook. Really sad its under-appreciated.<p>3. There is an unseen s<i></i>*load amount of hard work placed in Glitch, but it just all went boom to their face.<p>What is the problem? Does this mean hard work != successful?

If your product has to touch the outside world in some way, and there's already a de-facto standard way of doing that touching, you'll generally get your product done sooner and cheaper by using the de-facto standard. And the product will work better for the user, too. That is to say, it will be cheaper to make and it will also be worth a higher price. What engineer could say no to that?<p>If those decisions were driven by engineers, they must come from a very different engineering culture than anything I'm familiar with. Even if this really is the fault of engineering amok, blaming ""arrogant corporate culture"" might communicate the situation more clearly than blaming ""engineers.""",1352946476

Even when they have OK products they have no clear idea on how to sell them and how to differentiate versus competition. In Japan they still benefit from the complete absence of korean competitors (LG and Samsung are nowhere to be seen and that's hardly free market at work here) so I guess they can keep selling their overpriced TVs and Vaios for a while, but they are certainly taking a beating in other markets.<p>Yeah, I have not seen anything fantastic from Sony for a very, very long time.
