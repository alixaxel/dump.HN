4748917,comment,4748290,4748766,7,0,GoTeamMN,,,"Hi,<p>I used to invest back in the day. Anyway, there are many investing strategies. They all have names such as Value, Growth, Event Driven, etc. I won't list them all. The investing strategy that attempts to exploit movements in stock price after an event (e.g. the type that you are asking about for the earnings announcement in the Tesla example) is called ""Event Driven"" investing. Another example of an ""event"" would be after an acquisition is announced to the public. Typically the target (one being acquired) stock will go up and the acquiror (one acquiring) will go down. Investors often try to take advantage of this trend. What is the relationship that investors are betting on if the target price always (usually) goes up, and the acquirer going down?  Closing risk. At any point the acquisition, despite being publicly announced, could fall apart because of due diligence issues, etc.<p>Relating all that back to your question about Tesla: the fundamental value or true value of a company may or may not be reflected in a company's stock price. Think of the stock market as a manifestation of what people (investors) might believe the value is, but the reality is that the fundamentals might be vastly different. The reversion back to norm is something that happens as the market (investors who are imperfect--trust me--think AIG, Bear Stearns, Lehman) attempts to settle on true value.<p>Side note: Volatility in the stock price could also be attributed to a small float (not that many shares outstanding which leads to a small number of investors causing spikes in the price), but I'd have to look at Tesla's stock info to be certain.<p>Hope this helps,<p>Jenny",1352217245

I used to write a Tetris game in each language to make sure I actually understand it.<p>But now? most languages are basically the same Java/C# with minor variations in semantics and syntax - but you don't ""know"" C#/Java or even Ruby or Python these days unless you also know the library/framework ecosystem.

The vast majority of these I will never need to access again because the ones that I've liked, I've either stored in other drives (for example, a small drive of wedding photos for my portfolio or for recent customers) or on online services (yes, I know this is a cost in addition to the external drive, but I was using these services already, and for reasons other than just storage).<p>So for me, Glacier would be a place where I dump a chronological store of photos, a first-in-last-out kind of system. There's no need to regularly sync any of these photos. There may be a need to go back through certain folders years from now if I decided to compile something for a family album or something bespoke like that. And for that reason, it's necessary to have a last-resort store for these files.<p>So if I have 1TB of files that need to be rarely accessed and never updated, it's hard to justify spending that on Glacier (assuming I have a pretty safe external place to store this drive). At the rate that I accumulate files, it should only take me about an hour a year to backup photos. (plus the time it takes to find the hiding place for the hard drive).",1352216970

That rate has doubled since last month and is now at over 200 cars per week or 10,000 cars per year, which is at the critical threshold needed for Tesla to generate positive operating cash flow. One month from now, we expect Tesla to double production again and achieve the target rate of 400 cars per week or 20,000 per year. Despite many short term costs associated with the ramp, Tesla nonetheless expects to get approximately halfway to the 25% gross margin target by end of year.""</i><p>edit: until they are not producing at least 200 cars / week, the operating cost of their manufacturing line is actually larger than the money they make from those cars produced. So, based on that logic Tesla should be losing money but less than in the past. However, in this quarter they went from manufacturing 5 cars/week to 100, which is something you can probably only do by revamping your operations (e.g. acquire new machinery, hire new people, etc.) Therefore, you have to incur a cost now in order to get the benefits in the future.",1352214918

If a company sees the technology department as no different from the sales department, that was the company for me. It has been my secret to a happy career, later in my career when I had reached the level of an executive, I was a partner in a company that we exited to Hotels.com, when we did one of our business partners called me on the phone and asked me if I would entertain cleaning up their technology. I remember asking pretty bluntly, if I turn your technology department from a cost center into a profit center will you invest in it. Her response was along the lines of I would have to see it to believe it, but yes I would. We exited that company 2 years later. Moral of the story is, businesses can no longer afford to take the view that they are not a technology company, it has disrupted and infiltrated everything. For the majority of businesses technology is part of the game, if they are doing it badly they are not playing the game well, if technology is not in their market, it will be and if it's not a business can leverage that to their advantage now.",1352214763

More precisely every computer sends it to a computer it is directly connected to that it thinks is closer.  Eventually, hopefully, it gets to the right place.<p>If you just want to send chunks of data over IP and hope that they get there, you have UDP.<p>TCP is a more advanced protocol where one computer contacts another, and then a stream of data starts to flow between them through a connection.  Under the hood the stream is broken into chunks that are put in IP packets.  And there are extra packets for things like, ""Hello, trying to connect here"" ""I got these packets"" ""I'm done"" and so on.  Obviously TCP sits on top of IP.<p>DNS is a protocol for turning a human readable name like news.ycombinator.com into an IP address like 174.132.225.106.  Under the hood DNS uses both UDP and TCP.<p>BGP is a protocol that is used between routers to advertise how to route packets.  BGP uses TCP to work, so it is above TCP.  But that routing information is used at the IP level, so bad routes can stop IP from working.  Which is what happened here.  Someone advertised that they were how to get to a lot of Google addresses, so routers began sending Google traffic there.

4748652,comment,4743596,4745663,3,0,kls,,,"Being a diesel fan, and a 4x4 enthusiast I am pretty familiar with transmissions from different vendors. GM and their Allison division are know for producing some of the most reputable transmissions available. Their TH400 line is a staple in drag-racing, off-roading and most any high power application. In high power applications it is a given that the GM TH400 will be the transmission selected even if it is a Ford or Mopar powered vehicle.<p>They are correct in their assumption that software more and more is becoming the defining factor. Software has improved the automatic transmission to the point where humans cannot perform as well as shift points being set by software. We are amazing creatures that can instinctually feel many variables but if you can account for all of those variables and more in software we can be outperformed. Power train technology has reached that point and even vendors like Ferrari have taken notice. Vehicle connectivity and automation is the next revolution. Moving parts will be reduced to a minimum as software controls replace mechanical control parts. It has been a long time coming but software has reached the point where embedded controllers are expected and do provide the longevity of the mechanics it is replacing. The process started a long time ago with fuel management but much like the PC revolution and the mobile revolution, the proper convergence at the proper time has not taken place in the automotive market. I think it may be here now, and I think the shakeup in Detroit was needed to bring it about.",1352214151

4748648,comment,4748479,4748479,2,0,kevinconroy,,,"Helpful advice if your scrum process is run literally by the book.<p>In my experience, though, I've found that it's very natural to integrate graphic and UX design into sprints along side programmers. As the Product Owner, my goal has been to keep a rough roadmap of issues and features. I often schedule design or graphic work a sprint or two ahead of when we want development to occur. In this way, the requirements become more fully baked in advance of coding. If design or UX uncovers issues that cannot be solved by the end of the month that's okay. Just reevaluate during sprint review and determine next steps. Usually giving them another sprint provides enough time to figure things out.<p>Another trick is to have developers create a working ""wireframe"" version of features in the template language. (Think HTML with CSS turned off in your browser.) Then when it's working, hand it off to the designer to make it pretty in the next sprint. Doesn't work for every feature, but small to medium sized ones can benefit from this. This also provides a good way to handle scheduling contention so that the designer doesn't have to handle every issue before developers do.<p>Your milage may vary, but I've have 95%+ success with this technique.",1352214039
