4817330,comment,4814322,4817164,3,0,sparkie,,,"The ""extremist programming"" approach to enable language compositionality would begin by asking what do the languages have in common: are there any fundamental principles from which the specific principles in each language derive? If we were considering just F# and C# for now, and we asked what they have in common - I think the obvious approach is that we should model everything as functions: after all - everything in F# is a function, objects can be seen as tuples of sets of functions and sets of variables, and variables can be seen as functions returning a value.<p>Another approach might be to look at things as objects, and to try and model functional programming in terms of objects. I'm sure you're familiar with how F# is implemented, and you'll probably agree that it's a disaster (although the language itself isn't terrible). The idea of building functions on top of an OOP which is defined in terms of functions clearly misses the point somewhere. The end result is a very specific compatibility layer between two different languages, but very far from solving the more general problem of language compatibility.<p>.NET isn't the only platform, or even the first to attempt this approach though, and it's hard to really blame them for not solving this problem, which they didn't set out to solve, but merely added as an afterthought. The author's article is about solving problems on principle, rather than making practical solutions and then trying to adjust them to solve other problems.<p>Nemerle is an interesting language on the .NET platform. The idea behind it is to have a syntax which can be extended from the language's own macro system - using a type-safe AST which is targeted with a PEG grammar. The eventual idea is that you should be able to use any syntax to target the same semantics in the AST, essentially merging the language and compiler into the same tool. 2.0 version is an attempt to define all of Nemerle's own syntax as it's macros - making it a good example of the ""extremist programming"" the article is talking about (and certainly a bit closer to jonsen's vision than .NET in general).",1353553072

I'm glad Oracle didn't 404 it.<p>The title isn't accurate though. The article is mostly about using IEEE 754 to manage computational error, which is a pretty esoteric subject.<p>Most programmers spend precious little time using floating point and don't need to worry about computational error. Even among those who use it a great deal -- those doing numerical analysis -- computational error doesn't seem to be something they concern themselves with. My guess is that in most instances it's swamped by experimental error.<p>My thoughts on this article are:<p>1: It's certainly good that it's available online. It'd be better with a different title.<p>2: It's good that modern CPUs support IEEE 754 for the rare instance that people use it.<p>3: It's worth reading the first third or so of it, just to get an idea of what computational error is<p>4: The most important thing the ""typical"" programmer needs to know is that dollar values shouldn't be represented in floating point.

One important point is all the intellectual property that goes with your work => until complete payment, the work is yours, and usage of it is illegal.

My policy is simple : no refund, projects started are to be paid in full. If the clients needs an explanation for that, explain that while you dedicate yourself to his project, you have to say no to other projects.<p>Make it easy to get paid. Set up an online payment system or anything that makes the relation frictionless.

Usually, in my experience, clients who are hard to get payments from are the one hard to handle from the start. Usually individuals pr small companies, who try to get more for less.

As a result, those learning to adapt are creating four categories of information:
(1) Stuff I need to know
(2) Stuff I should know
(3) Stuff I'd like to know
(4) Stuff I don't care about<p>Content shortening/summarization helps augment our ability to quantify what fits into 2, 3, and 4. If I read the first paragraph of a traditionally written journalistic piece, I know where it fits before the second paragraph. But a precious small percentage of online content is written in that manner -- first paragraph giving the reader enough information to know what to do next. (There's a whole rant on our lost ability to write, but that's for later.)

That doesn't necessarily mean he was looking for literal parallels.  And if he were, I don't see why ""pneumatic tube that sucks a single person up"" would turn into just ""tube"" to a layman, either.  He's also mentioned the Concorde and a railgun.  How do those fit into your vision?  Will a layperson see those in your car/tunnel system?<p>I'm not just saying ""pointless complexity"".  I'm telling you why it's pointless.  Your system is certainly more complex than an evacuated tube, and without a compelling reason to embrace such complexity, then it is indeed pointless.<p>Let's step back a bit, though.  You're saying that your system is easier to implement than an evacuated tube.  Let's assume that's true (though I don't think it is).  Is it also easier to implement than a partially evacuated tube?  Those are expected to travel at or past Mach I, and <i>don't need the car to move nearly 100% of the air in the tunnel</i>.  How is your proposal superior?  You talk about using the plungers to evacuate air, but the energy cost to remove the air must still be paid.  Your 70 ton slugs might carry more momentum, but a car in a partially evacuated tube wouldn't need to displace all the air it encounters, and so wouldn't need as much momentum.  You're constantly paying the cost to push around a bunch of air.  That cost is largely avoided with a more traditional design.<p>I'm not certain about your idea that you don't need a tight seal.  Yes, at Mach I a gust would blow pretty hard.  But in a near-vacuum you'll not be blowing much air.  Remember that you're going to have to blow with >1 atmosphere of pressure to push anything out and past the flaps.  Also remember that this ""gust"" is the result of resistance caused by the giant plug you're pushing down the tube, resistance that another design might just avoid or at least minimize.  And any air not evacuated by the ""gust"" will contribute to further drag as the plunger pushes past it.",1353549840

But the reason I choose black is simple:<p>Often, the LCD projector is not pointed straight at the backdrop or maximized correctly. If your slide background is not black, there is a perceptible margin, and your slide area is shaped like a trapezoid, not a rectangle. Using a black slide background minimizes this margin, and makes it look like your slides correctly fill the backdrop.<p>Just my two cents. I'm curious if people feel strongly against this approach.",1353549693

I'm still glad that I used flightfox, because the expert advice I got saved me $300 by pointing out that returning to Canada from Germany was much cheaper than returning from Austria -- but the booking instructions were completely useless.<p>If you can add a ""book via flightfox"" mechanism which guarantees that the flights actually exist, I'll tell everybody I know to use flightfox every time they travel.",1353549686
