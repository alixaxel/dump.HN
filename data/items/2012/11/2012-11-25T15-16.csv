I hoped to major in AI, but after taking 2 upper level classes, one focusing on symbolic AI and the other focusing on Bayesian networks, I was completely turned off.<p>Our brains are massively parallel redundant systems that share practically nothing in common with modern Von Neumann CPUs. It seemed the only logical approach to AI was to study neurons. Then try to discover the basic functional units that they form in simple biological life forms like insects or worms. Keep reverse engineer brains of higher and higher life forms until we reach human level AI.<p>Whenever I tried to relate my course material in AI to what was actually going on in a brain, my profs met my questions with disdain and disinterest. I learned more about neurons in my high school AP Bio class than either of my AI classes. In their defense, we've come a long ways, with new tools like MRIs and neural probes.<p>The answers are all locked up in our heads. It took nature millions of years of natural selection to engineer our brains. If we want to crack this puzzle in our lifetimes, we to copy nature, not reinvent it from scratch.  Purely mathematical theories like Bayesian statistics that have no basis in Biological systems might work in specific cases, but are not going to give us strong AI.<p>Are these new deep learning algorithms for neural networks rooted in biological research? Do we have to necessary tools yet to start reversing engineering the basic functional units of the brain?",1353858181

FWIW, I am reproducing my comment from that previous thread here.<p><i>Disclaimer: Long time Opera user and probably an Opera browser fan.<p>I have been using Opera since its ""ad-supported"" days. It was bundled with one of those PC magazines that gave out free software/shareware for the bandwidth challenged in those days (97/98-ish?), and fell in love instantly.<p>Opera is probably the most configurable, hackable and feature-full browser out there up to this day, and I still find things to configure and customise to this day (now on Opera 12.10). Opera also provides the user with an option to install itself as a portable version which I found very cool. It is also very light on PC resources (YMMV -- anecdata)<p>I also find it very annoying that a looot of websites do not support this browser.... at all despite its being on par (if not better) in most if not all browser tests (I heard they lagged behind on the most recent tests).<p>Opera Mini is blazingly fast on not-so-smartphones (used it on the Nokia ASHA series) and Android smartphones as well (anecdata -- my experience). It beats out Nokia's own browser which incidentally has adopted the ""Turbo"" architecture for its own browsers.<p>IMO the article does great disservice to Opera's technical/technological advanced capabilities by ignoring all of those and solely focussing the article around socialism and dictatorship and poor net connections in ""those other countries"" instead ( [almost] creating a straw-man in the process).

The net result of this is that Chile is now ahead of the United States in the corruption perception index:<p><a href=""http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2011/results/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2011/results/</a><p>A result they can be very proud of, especially given the surrounding countries. There is still a lot of work to do, there will always be a pressure for the return of corruption where it has already been dealt with but on the whole I think this is a fantastic achievement in a time-frame that makes it even more impressive.<p>The effect of cleaning up at the higher levels of government has trickled down to lower parts to the point where bribing police is no longer acceptable/required, as it should be.<p>In Chile the various achievements have been in reaction to scandals that got wide exposure, it seems that that is one avenue through which real change can be brought about.<p>If all of Latin America would adopt the various Chilean policies I'm pretty sure that it would benefit the region greatly, just imagine if 17 years from now you'd be able to say the same about Colombia, Peru and Venezuela.

Without testing between different options, using control groups and working on some specific domain (e.g performance for programming vs prose writing), common sense is useless.<p>(Not to mention that even in programming common sense can be both right and irrelevant --e.g. common sense might correctly assume that some function can be optimized to perform 3x faster, but fails to that it takes only 0.2% of the total running time in the first place so the win would be negligible).<p>><i>You can see some automatically-optimised keyboard layouts here, and decide whether they look different enough from Dvorak for it (or the site itself) to qualify as a scam: <a href=""http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization*"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/carpalx/?full_optimization*</a><p>I never argued against alternative keyboard layouts, or that qwerty is the best. Just that Dvorak is not worth it (and mostly, badly tested placebo solution). I've read the mwbrooks article in the past, the points he makes are not really worth it -- mostly a hack job.<p>In any case, if we need a future keyboard layout standard, it would have to take into account use cases (e.g programming vs journalism, etc), modern typography and extended glyphs, and of course since this is 2012, international language switching (I, and billions of other people, alternate between english and my language layout).",1353856162
