Or have they not done due diligence?<p>As a software engineer, what kind of authorisation should I be looking for?

Instantly this rubbed me up the wrong way; anyone who knows about Google Analytics knows that the login details are tied to Google accounts. Which, in every site I've ever managed, or seen managed, has been the developing company. So I found it really ironic that a company who specialises in SEO doesn't understand how Google Analytics logins work. So I replied with the FTP details, and kindly told them how Google analytics worked and how I needed the SEO company's email address so I could add it to the GA profile. He forwarded that email to the SEO company, and I received an email back, with the same copy-and-pasted dot point list of FTP details (which had already been sent), and Google Analytics login details. They didn't even read my email. And it bothers me that people so incompetent are actually working and making money, and their clients are none the wiser.

I know my changes were really early to the library\n    and some of my code may not even exist anymore (lol).   \n\n    But I believe the cost for them to audit the whole library and rip out all\n    of our changes and rewrite it all could be major -- I believe Bob could\n    legally remove all of our code; but for the actual re-implementation Bob\n    would have to hand it off to someone to do a fully clean-room version to\n    make them legally safe from being sued.   And that could be very costly in\n    time and resources.   Cost wise for them It might even be cheaper for them\n    to ditch the last 6-7 months of changes and to just revert to the version\n    before my patch/commit (which was issue #3  <G>).

This is especially useful for the numerous plastic-shelled landmines that resist standard detection methods.<p>Using a layered approach with these techniques, civilian demining organisations like Mechem[0] (which pioneered the use of sniffer dogs) are now able to achieve a high enough clearance rate to make areas safe, though the work is expensive and time-consuming.
