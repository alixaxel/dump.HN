Even so, you only have three fears: 0) You poorly secure your account and someone logs in as you and takes your coins 1) Bitcoin's value plummets and you lose all your invested money. 2) Mt. Gox loses some of their actual coins, and refuses to let you withdraw from your balance with them. 0 and 2 are theft, which is a constant concern to anyone regardless of what is being stolen. While I don't think Mt. Gox insures any of its deposits with something similar to FDIC insurance, I bet there's an insurance company out there that will insure your bitcoins for a fee.<p>Also, it's easy to get rid of #0 as a fear.

4792770,comment,4791295,4792238,3,0,eric-hu,,,"> Since a breaker bar (or actually the torque measuring version of it)<p>You're thinking of a torque wrench.<p>The pipe extension trick won't work for torque values far exceeding the rating of the breaker bar.  I've snapped the head off a breaker bar with a pipe on it.  Generally, I've needed a breaker bar with a 30% higher torque limit than the torque specs of a bolt/nut in order to loosen said fastener after it's settled (generally a few days).  Change that to about 50% higher once the fastener has fused to its shaft/bolt/socket (months to years, depending on environment too).<p>If you could get a torque wrench for $5 that would torque down power line tower fasteners to spec, then yes, I'd agree that a $5 breaker bar would do the job.  It should only be stronger than a torque wrench of similar price.<p>The thing is that the fasteners for power line towers are huge, way bigger than the fasteners I've encountered working on cars.  Fasteners that large aren't practical to lay down with mechanical tools that amplify human strength.  They'll require pneumatic or hydraulic power equipment.<p>I still agree with your basic premise that cheap equipment can easily destroy expensive setups with some creativity.  Perhaps a fuel source like thermite or magnesium would work.",1353048682

4792768,comment,4791295,4791644,1,0,nikcub,,,"Regarding the power and substation vulnerability to a simple steel chain, the power companies in my area picked up on this around 5 or 6 years ago and have upgraded the security at every power and substation in this area and beyond.<p>Previously the substations had a small fence around them. There have been work crews working on each station one at a time to completely overhaul the security. They placed a much larger electrified fence around the station, placed most of the transformers into small brick buildings and have a chain link fence covering the entire complex (a fence that is easily collapsed back for emergency access).<p>You can tell that they spend <i>a lot</i> of money on these security improvements, there are large alarms, big warning signs, they sat the fences a dozen yards or so further back so you can't get closer.<p>It didn't need a security incident for this power company to figure out that they had a simple vulnerability and to fix it.<p>That said, there is no equivalent easy improvement that could be made to LTE networks to secure them. The flaw is in the protocols, and fixing it would require a new network stack and new phones, not just a bigger fence.",1353048678

4792759,comment,4768477,4768477,2,0,jonsterling,,,"Sigh. A type `m` is a ""monad"" if a few functions can be written for it with the following signatures (there are some laws too, but just ignore those until you understand the basics):<p><pre><code>    return :: a -> m a\n    bind :: (a -> m b) -> m a -> m b\n</code></pre>\nThat's all it is. What you've described is a particular type for which these functions can be written.<p>My advice: stop trying to think of particular ways monads can be used. Rather, you need to understand it as embodying a special flavor of embedding values and functions from one space (the space of simple types a, a -> m b) into another (the space of types m a, m a -> m b).<p>So, bind, apply and map are just ways of lifting different-shaped functions into (m a -> m b):<p><pre><code>    map   :: (a -> b)   -> (m a -> m b) -- from Functor\n    bind  :: (a -> m b) -> (m a -> m b) -- from Monad\n    apply :: m (a -> b) -> (m a -> m b) -- from Applicative\n</code></pre>\nThe moment you start trying to understand these with some first-order metaphor, you know you've lost the way! :)",1353048455

I think that some engineers work better with a lot of freedom, but most don't. I think that actually a good solid layer of ""proper"" management is way more useful. A good manager is someone who doesn't get in your way but help you realize your full potential while following the company's vision.\nGranted, that's not what most managers do, but I do think that most of us need some leadership, some directions to help us focus.
