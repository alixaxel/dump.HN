4747589,comment,4746646,4747354,8,0,babebridou,,,"Minecraft and Frontier EliteII conveyed pretty much the same feeling of absolute freedom, yes. Of course, Minecraft was based on a completely different premise - changing the world instead of exploring it.<p>It can be argued that there has always been a contrast between procedural games and handcrafted games, a contrast that has followed us since the dawn of game design. Procedural tends to mean lifeless, Handcrafted tends to mean depthless.<p>There is no longer a clear distinction between the two, though. Games tend to include procedural elements and interweave them with handcrafted ones. Procedurals are generally used to provide a longer game experience, while Handcrafts are generally used to convey a story or a designer's cut of fun.<p>A recent example could be Diablo 3. This is at the core a Procedural game. The game has been divided in acts, chapters and quests. Each quest ends with a handcrafted challenge, each chapter ends with a handcrafted miniboss fight, and each Act ends with a handcrafted ""act boss"" fight. Everything in between, including the fights, the rare monsters, the champion monsters, the stage layout and of course the loot, is procedurally generated. The designers have a set of game rules that dictate how and when this or that monster can spawn, how it looks like, and how, when, and what kind of loot it can drop.<p>For some players, this extends the game's depth and the fun they can get, from a dozen hours of handcrafted content to hundreds, possibly even thousands of hours of procedurally generated entertainment.<p>Another great example would be Skyrim. Again at the core, the Elder Scrolls series is procedurally generated, but with a twist; in Daggerfall, the third episode, they pushed the envelope to its limit with a really humongous generated world, of a size that only Elite games could surpass. With time they realized that they went too far; they had to restrict the procedural aspect and resume the handcrafting. Using the procedurally generated content as a mold, they could ""paint"" the game on top of it to make it feel more lively, possibly more epic with each following iteration thanks to a better engine and of course a bigger budget.<p>Then there's the opposite line of game design - those that start as Handcrafted with increasing amounts of procedurally generated elements as the franchise advances. The Dragon Age series is widely seen as taking this path (a mistake in my opinion).<p>For some other games that are pretty much only procedural, check The Sims, Sim City and their ilk, Dwarf Fortress, Audiosurf, NetHack of course, the Civilization series, etc. The whole line of EASports games could also be seen as procedurally generated as well depending on your point of view. ""God Games"" such as From Dust are also generally procedural.",1352188421

The Senate and it's 60 votes to pass a bill filibuster rule make change too difficult.<p>The Senate does not represent the country well. California has two senators, so does Wyoming.<p>The next two years will be gridlock. It's unlikely Democrats retake the House and get sixty seats in the Senate, so divided government is what we have to look forward to.<p>The Senate is a strong architectural advantage for Conservative politics in the US.<p>This situation is unlikely to change.

Some were criminal, and had pirates circling. Many goods were common across them, but you could buy narcotics and slaves from criminal systems.  Your behaviour affected how other ships would react - trading slaves was profitable, but you'd be attacked by police and pirates.  Attacking other cargo ships (to capture their cargo) would turn you criminal.  Attacking pirates would make you more law-abiding.<p>You could find two systems and find the right product to buy-low, sell-high.<p>There's more in common with games like Fallout 3, although fallout 3 didn't really have a good trading system.<p>(All the above is from memory.

Really. The things I find appealing are entirely orthogonal to the rest of the world, especially that cool school of UX engineers.  I'm generally content with synchronous http requests, and adding Ajax is <i>always</i> an afterthought.<p>As a result, I stopped making crap websites for people.  I started making nice backends, and who doesn't love a nice backend(?).<p>Everyone (especially me) is a lot happier when I'm not breaking the look and feel of a site/app/application/product, and I'm a lot happier when I don't have to care how it looks. I'll provide an API, and some other person can make it look good.  That's the way the world works.<p>Asking everyone to be a full-stack engineer is a nice pipe dream, but consider the same in other professions.  You'd be asking neurosurgeons to know the same level of detail as dermatologists, and vice versa.

4747568,comment,4747567,4747567,1,0,dkural,,,"These are basically my thoughts on the subject - as naive as they may be; I'm looking for greater enlightenment. I start by claiming/assuming that growth is one of the best ways out of the woods for the US economy.<p>Without taking a stance on either candidate; I'd like to point out that economically;  the correlation between tax cuts / tax increases v.s. growth is weak; except for the extremes - and for the following reason: It's all about who'll spend it faster. If the government spends that money; the economy will grow. If the people who got the tax cuts spend that money; economy will grow.<p>With that in mind; let's look at the American case. Currently, US companies are sitting on top of > $1.5 trillion in cash in their US accounts. I applaud their decision not to spend this in face of weak demand. If you build another factory you won't be able to sell the goods.. etc.  Thus - if we give people with high income / companies more cash through tax cuts; it is unlikely that they'll invest this to create jobs;  mainly due to weak demand. They don't currently lack the money to invest; they simply think the returns don't justify the investment.<p>On the other hand; if the government were to just pay down debt in the short term with the money it would keep right now;  this wouldn't help the economy much either.<p>The income of the middle class of this country has been declining in real terms for the past 30 years; which is killing demand everywhere.  They need to be able to buy all the stuff companies produce.  The middle class needs a tax cut & higher incomes.  If there will be a tax cut; it should go to the middle class;  because they'll spend the money.<p>Also, I'd like the government to keep some of the money and spend it.  I'd like this to be spent in education; infrastructure; and science - areas of high return in the long term as well as the short.<p>I'd like the government to invest in upgrading the national infrastructure - bridges, roads, rails, energy distribution.. which means the companies getting the contracts get a lift. They will need and will procure everything from welders to bricklayers to cement .. The whole construction sector benefits.<p>I'd like to see NSF + NIH spending to increase. This is an investment in the American military so it can keep its technological edge. It is also the lifeblood of the  technology and biotechnology industries - the crown jewels of the American economy.<p>I'd like to see investment in education; because many low-skilled jobs are not coming back. In the long term; an investment in education is the best indicator of macroeconomic success for a country.<p>So - it's not about tax cuts v.s. government. It's about a) who gets the tax cuts, will they spend it?  b) how will the government spend the money?   I'd like to see the candidates talk more about that.",1352187832

The key point being that those randomly chosen people don't have the power, it the assembly of all the citizens that have the power.<p>And it's based on that that they have created the first (and only, for some people) democratic system ever. Ironically, the person that have created our current democratic system knew exactly this Athenian system but explicitly rejected it because it was ... democracy, and that is was a system were the people really has the power. It's only since Tocqueville has started to call it democracy that we think about it has democratic, Tocqueville who explicitly said that he wasn't afraid of election because people would vote what we told them to vote, something impossible in the Athenian system.",1352185812

How deep? On the above example - maybe you know internals of Rails + Rack very well. If you are on the frontend may be you should have a thorough understanding of how browsers work, how HTML/CSS is parsed and rendered etc. I don't really have a good explanation as to <i>why</i> this is important but I've noticed that the really good web developers or designers tend to have at least one specialization or deep interest within their fields.",1352185644
