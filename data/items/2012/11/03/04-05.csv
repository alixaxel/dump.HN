4735934,comment,4734192,4735815,1,0,zecho,,,"As it grows, it hasn't really improved my close friendships, either. I was originally in love with Facebook precisely because it improved those relationships.<p>Things were a bit different in college, I guess, when only .edu email holders were on the site. I'm not sure if that's because it was a safe walled garden for students to be themselves online or if it was because I had a much higher ratio of close friends to extended relationships. Either way, as the site has grown and more Bosses and Grandmas have joined, normally complex people who interact with me differently than the Boss or Grandma were suddenly forced to act in a lowest common denominator way.<p>I'll admit that the reason I left Facebook (late 2009) had little to do with privacy or advertising and more to do with the fact that most of my friends stopped posting pictures and self-censored because both Grandma and the Boss might see it. If I wanted interesting human contact, Facebook was decreasingly the place to find it.<p>Anyway, my gripe about the Facebook narrative, in addition to the one you just brought up, is that Facebook is the de facto place to communicate with anyone. It's not. It may be the path of least resistance in communicating with those acquaintances, but there are hundreds of ways to get in touch with people now. Facebook's grasp of social interaction is less of a stranglehold and more of a thin curtain that people, for whatever reason, refuse to look behind.",1351918365

If it's more physical RAM than is currently available, not necessarily a problem - some other processes can be pushed out of RAM into swap. If it's more than that, some pages can be discarded because they're backed by binaries on disk. If it's more than that, some processes can be killed. If it's more than that, really bad things happen.<p>The problem is that there's no good way to differentiate between a process that merely wants more VM that it'll never touch and a process that wants actual RAM. In theory, every fork() should double your VM requirements - in practice, almost all are immediately followed by an exec() and the previous allocations are irrelevant. Do you fail fork() because you can't guarantee you can back every modified page in the new process? If not, why should you fail malloc() because you can't guarantee you can back it?

Wikipedia appears to have a pretty solid writeup of the electoral college system (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_States)#Alternative_methods_of_choosing_electors"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_College_(United_State...</a> ) which includes the various mechanisms states use to select their electors.<p>The vast majority of the states are winner-take-all, which presumably reduces but doesn't eliminate the possible ways to split 538 down the middle, but some states either only have a single electoral vote or use mechanisms which can divide their electoral votes between the candidates.<p>So, yeah, every election has this chance.  Probably isn't going to happen though.  This is conjecture, but I'd hazard a guess that a Bush v. Gore style dispute over a single large state which holds the balance of the election is way more likely than an actual numerical tie where the House would choose the president and the Senate the VP.",1351916851

The PS1 hand thousands of games available and if you were into imports you could get your hands on japanese gems as well, literally quadrupling the games available for the system. There was no other system like it (the closest in that regard being the Saturn). The N64 never reached that kind of ""standard"" status and therefore the offering and third party support was limited at best. As to whether the N64 was a more powerful system, yeah, it may have been, but on consoles we all know that software makes the different more than hardware.<p>There's a clear reason why the N64 sold way less than the PS1: it was just a much better deal to get a PS1 if you wanted to play lots of different games. The market is not stupid :)",1351916667
