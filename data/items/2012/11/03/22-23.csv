I don't care if the new iPhone does 5 times less network requests on maps when not on wi-fi but gets less POIs because the map provider is pulverized, on China is X while on Iceland is Y, but on San Francisco bla bla bla. Frankly, talking to a Wikipedia is boring.<p>The other thing that helped is that I gave up trying to live on the bleeding edge of anything. I don't sleep on the line to buy an iPad mini, I wait three days if and when I have the free time. I don't know what's the current best SSD, I google it when I am actually about to buy it.

I don't think the providers need to provide a basics level, especially if they are getting sign up numbers into the 50k per course. But providing basics courses or self-study pre-courses would be a good move, considering the number of people in the logic course who, unfortunately, didn't have the knowledge base the course requires.<p>There are some pain points coursera could smooth over, and having a better course search and course reference system is one of them.<p>I think, because it seems that a number of these courses are on line equivalents of off line courses, the thought hasn't been put into making the course abstracts stand on their own, but instead are just rewordings of the standard course descriptions.",1351983211

The problem with Heroku is they don't have explicit support for PHP, so that could be an issue for you.\nIf you're going to go after big client work, Amazon Web Services (EC2) familiarity is a nice checkbox to tick.<p>Remember a server is just a computer.

4738119,comment,4737033,4738081,2,0,mjb,,,"It's not clear what you mean. If we have two components, one of which is 99% available and one of which is 100% available, the second is not 1% better than the first. It is infinitely better than the first. It's well understood in reliability engineering that, at least in the long term, the cost of availability increases exponentially as the goal approaches 100%.<p>Buying more expensive hardware (with better per-component availability) is one approach to a full availability picture. However, it's one with significant shortcomings. At the top end, it's very expensive. Across the board, it only addresses some possible threats, and completely doesn't address others (like natural disasters). The alternate approach is redundancy. That approach is not without it's shortcomings, including increased system complexity and the problems of failure detection and failover. However, it's generally lower cost and is more robust to multiple types of threats.<p>This is why RAID is so successful - because it is a reliable set of techniques for building highly-reliable systems out of unreliable components. Again, it only protects against one threat (drive failure) and not others (fire), but it's proven superior to the alternative ""buy a single gold-plated drive"" approach.<p>Low-end gear isn't for everybody. Cutting corners in the wrong places is dumb. On the other hand, high-end gear only saves you in some ways, and those ways may not matter to your business. If you want high-availability or high-durability you need to know to things: how much your data is worth, and what you are protecting it from. Until you know these answers, you're going to be making poor system design decisions.",1351981934

A data race occurs when two or more threads access the same memory locations in a undefined order.  The OS can interrupt threads at any time, it's hard to test all possible interleavings of instructions from multiple threads.  Programmers typically have some invariants in their mind but it's really easy to make a mistake, and hard to detect it.<p>To use the tool, you compile a C/C++ program in a different way.  The ASAN toolchain instruments your memory accesses.  Then you run your program (or unit tests for library code).  And it will tell you if there were memory errors like data races.  Then you look at your source code and fix the bug.<p>Valgrind does a similar thing and is a standard open source tool.  As mentioned on the page, this is faster.",1351981800

I don't wanna discourage you or anything, but you should definitely think about validating all your assumptions before investing money and time into building your startup.
