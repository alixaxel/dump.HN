4735650,comment,4732684,4733610,1,0,loceng,,,"I find that people who copy, or try to, didn't come up with the idea themselves - which means they didn't have the experience and knowledge, nor have the creativity in coming up with the solution on their own. This will limit their ability to pivot due to not necessarily having a full grasp of the important metrics, etc.. And really just their mind isn't structured to do that, and if it was they'd probably have their own ideas that could become successful - assuming they're able to learn how to execute well. Also, most stories that aren't genuine don't feel authentic - especially because they don't have the history to match it, like you mentioned with your 15+ years of experience, etc.. My own story and plans have evolved because of everything that's happened in my life, and I can talk about each important moment<p>It's very frustrating, and becoming livid has happened to me too.. It's even worse because many of the times they are people you're closer to than not, so there's a bigger element of trust broken there, too.<p>Congrats on being 5 years down the road, and continuing to evolve things further! Is the 5 years from initial MVP launch or when you came up with the idea? Your story is inspirational for me. In about 6 months I'm coming up on 3 years from when I decided to work on my projects full time, which have expanded tremendously, so at the moment it's still a lot of planning, organizing, preparing... lining up a lot of dominoes so then things will take off once ready.",1351907904

4735646,comment,4735169,4735169,2,0,paupino_masano,,,"I actually do most of my debugging in IE now - and I've actually come to like the devkit they've got going. Ok, I am developing for internal intranets which of which my primary is IE, but they've actually come a long way. In terms of PC browsers (Mac is a different story) I'd probably put Chrome first, IE second and Firefox third.<p>I still prefer Chrome, but partly because it is my preferred browser on Mac too - I like consistency. I also think that their devkit is ever so slightly better... but in saying that I'm not unhappy with IE - it does what I tell it to do, it's fairly consistent and feels quite light (compared to Firefox which still feels heavy to me even after their improvements...). Admittedly there are some tricks you need to learn in the IE devkit (e.g. add an attribute of style to create new CSS definitions) but all in all I think they've done a pretty good job at cleaning up their act!<p>PS: I used to do ALL my development in Firefox with Firebug and the Webdev kit. I find now that Chrome/IE handles things very well: though Chrome still allows me to install the Webdev kit if I need it (e.g. rulers, security checks etc). I guess I switch browser camps often based on my needs :)",1351907791

4735638,comment,4734930,4735486,5,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"I don't think the argument applies to all software. For any given implementation, there are arbitrarily many alternative implementations that are functionally equivalent. You can't copyright the function, but you can copyright the implementation.<p>What distinguishes an API is that it is by definition the unambiguous formal specification of the implementation's function. A function can only be used if the provider and user of the interface agree. Once one side is established, it removes all opportunity for creativity from the other. If the library provides ""sort(container&, iterator start, iterator end)"" then that's how the user has to call it; you have no choice. And if the user code calls it that way then every library implementation must implement it that way.<p>APIs are in a bit of a curious situation in that making them can be a creative activity but then the act of specifying them makes the specification functional. But if you think about it, it isn't really all that novel. It happens anywhere you have an interface between functional components of anything -- you can make the interface decorative, but you can't use that to exclude competitors from the market, because by incorporating what would otherwise be decoration as a necessary part of the interface, you make it inherently functional. You can't exclude competitors from making screw drivers compatible with your screws (or screws compatible with your screw drivers) just by using an arbitrary new screw head and then trying to claim copyright over it. (Naturally utility patents are a different animal.)",1351907625

4735619,comment,4733768,4733768,2,0,milton_vsee,,,"Dear Everyone - this is milton, CEO of VSee.  VSee is bad at marketing - I would be the first to agree with you! :)  I would like to share what we have tried, and what we are doing.<p>First - we created vsee to change how people work.  When I as a graduate student, I worked at Intel Research Lab every Fri - and the 101 drive back to Stanford Fri night was killing me - and I did that for 5 years :(  I noticed that the hottest tech companies - Apple, Google, FB, etc - did not truly embrace remote work.  The reason is that productivity drops by 50% when people are in remote offices.  so our team set out to create a tool that allows people to work remotely w/o the productivity tax.  We are spread across 9 cities - and our company policy is that even the local staff only comes to the office on Fridays (free lunch, fun, etc) - vsee is designed to let us work (thus the fast screen share, live annotation for design, pair programming, sales, etc).<p>Next - we do want to make money and have a lot of users :)  Because our company is almost all designers and engineers - we struggled with marketing a lot.  We tried getting on Tech Crunch, other press coverage, etc - and we have mostly failed.  Our top users use vsee a lot - but I couldn't figure out a way to describe vsee where the press would care.  People just assume this is another skype or webex copycat - while we are solving a different problem (we want to allow people to work, vs. making a remote presentation).<p>We also tried partnerships - it is slow and painful.  contact me privately and I will share our war stories.<p>I attended a talk by Rand Fishkin - and I loved it.  so 6 months ago we decided to focus on inbound marketing.  we wrote a lot of vsee vs. X articles as a sales tool previously.  so we posted them, and added SEO keywords.  the result suggests this is a good marketing move :)  we get a lot of customers from Tokbox, Skype, etc.  if you search for competitor X alternative - vsee is now on 1st or 2nd page for most of the big guys in this space.  We tried buying google ad words, but our space is too hot - we can't afford it.  so riding on our competitors' coattail seems reasonable.<p>However, our goal is to get to hundreds of millions of users - and toward that marketing goal we have failed.  Our challenge is that vsee is not a video conference tool, but a tool to let you work.  we couldn't figure out how to describe this in a marketing way.<p>We did notice that our top users are telling their coworkers  verbally - 50% of our web visitors download vsee and sign up (i was told this is insanely high).  But vsee didn't have a viral loop - so the spreading factor was less than 1.  so 2 months ago - we decided to focus on viral loop design.  I attended <a href=""http://growthhackersconference.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://growthhackersconference.com</a> last Fri - and it was the best event ever!!! :)<p>Our marketing focus now (in terms of resources):
1. viral loop growth hacking: 90%
2. inbound marketing: 5%
3. press outreach: 4%
4. partnerships: 1%<p>hopefully millions of people will be able to use <a href=""http://vsee.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vsee.com</a> for free soon!!! :)<p>ps: why do I travel to and work in refugee camps?  to be brutally honest, I was not a save-the-world type.  In school, I was probably the biggest nerd you would ever meet.  I spent most of my time in libraries and writing code - research and hacking were my passions.  since VSee requires less than half the bandwidth of Skype, and its fast screen share makes it a simple work tool - we have a lot of users in developing countries.  As i learned about our users - I became part of their world - and I started traveling to refugee camps to work there.  I have traveled to Syria on the Iraq border where Hillary Clinton used vsee, worked with Angelina Jolie to vsee w/ Chad/Darfur.  After working in many countries in Africa, Mideast, Southeast Asia - now supporting our users there has become my passion.  But I do struggle with how to spend my time - so that vsee the company is not hurt by my refugee activities.",1351907003

A normal void method would start returning Task when turned async (and a non-void method returning T would start returning Task<T>). Async void is a special, distinct beast which is fire-and-forget by definition, and it only exists in async land. Perhaps they should have used a special new keyword for that instead, but in any case, it's a completely orthogonal problem.",1351906068

No one has come up with a good dataflow debugger yet, and it might not even be viable. The best you can do is interpose ""probes"" on your code like you would take measurements with an oscilloscope. Disclosure: I did my dissertation on signals (object-oriented ones to be precise), and am a bit disillusioned with it.<p>On the other hand, the argument from the declarative community is that you don't need to debug your code.<p>A better alternative to FRP/signals might be immediate mode user interfaces. Since they are conceptually called on every frame, you get the benefits of FRP while still being able to debug in the old way. On the other hand, they are quite inefficient, though I think we could play some tricks with technology to make them better (memoize, refresh blocks of computations only as needed via dependency tracing).",1351905202
