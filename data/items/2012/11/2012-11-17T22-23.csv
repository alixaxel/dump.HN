This despite working at several companies where OpenBSD was actually core to our entire infrastructure.<p>I'm not saying that nobody does (I expect the OpenBSD developers probably do), but I am strongly suggesting that OpenBSD needs <i>no</i> desktop presence whatsoever to be extraordinarily successful.  I've never installed it on the desktop.  I've never seen anybody install it on the desktop.  Not once in 15 years.  There is no rationale reason to run OpenBSD as a desktop, and I'll go further and say I will likely never see X-Windows run on OpenBSD.<p>And, as for a niche - I consider OpenBSD to be the pre-eminent platform for Firewalling, IPsec, IPv6.  Their continual focus on consistency makes the system a joy to use - all of the lessons I learned in 2001/2002 are almost 100% (hell, they might be 100%) applicable to managing an OpenBSD system today.<p>They may be a <i>niche</i> but it's a pretty darn big one.<p>With regards to your argument regarding ""upstream"" support - most of the upstream support required is around elements that are not associated with the desktop, and, in many areas, openBSD has just decided to rewrite the upstream contribuions in their own ""OpenBSDsh"" way anyways.<p>I'm confident they will do fine even if upstream support for desktop, and associated applications, no longer considers BSD as a first-rate platform.",1353192850

Loading updateable binary microcode to implement an ISA is often a beneficial processor design technique and it dates back to seventies.<p>There's some irony in the OpenBSD objection to handling binary blobs. A lot of the cool old systems OpenBSD supports are LOADED with microcode and ROM the user can never see or understand. It's hidden. To a degree this is even true in the case of the everyday AMD64 machine (which loads microcode updates and some of its boot logic from BIOS ROM/EFI, thank you).<p>OpenBSD's position, in conjunction with its support of these systems that load all that stuff from ROM at boot time and its lack of support for the ones without a proper ROM to store the stuff (raspberry pi, for example), keep it from having to handle these blobs personally. The principle involved here isn't ""let's shun the use of binaries for which we don't have the source code."" The principle is ""binaries are yucky, don't get any on you.""

He's got a worldview that I think he's invested in, and he's got a tone (deflating what he sees to be the overenthusiastic techno-nerds) that he likes, and both make him pretty bad at prediction.  He sees Moore's law in his own life, but fails to apply it or similar principles to the world going forward.  If he was practicing futurism in 1912 he'd be writing that cars are inherently a stunt because we can never build enough roads or find enough fuel for them, and in the year 2412 people will be living in mile high brick building surrounded by a wasteland of horse manure from the perpetually animal-clogged streets.<p>There are so many problems with the ""ZOMG we're all going to be roasted by global warming"".  I'll leave aside the fact that there's been no increase in average temperatures in 15 years (to avoid the whole  ""climate change denier"" fight that no one wants to have) and just accept as given for this discussion that, yes, average temperatures might rise 2 or 3 C.  Given that space launch gets cheaper every year, given that robots get better every year, given that manufacturing gets cheaper every year, etc., it will be trivial in 50 years - let along 500 - to have robots build huge solar shields in orbit, or have robots build huge dikes around our coastal cities (we reclaimed thousand of acres of land from the oceans in the middle ages - we can't do that in the 21st century?), or have giant naval cannons fire explosive shells full of light block aerosols into the upper atmosphere, or, or, or ...<p>There are so many ideas that aren't 50 years out - let alone centuries out - that can solve these problems.<p>I think that it's a truism that different countries have different default outlooks.

Germans are prone to being a bit dour, etc.<p>Stross seems to be in the mainstream of British / Scottish cultural thought (at least as it's been revealed to be by fiction, both science fiction and mainstream).

Although, assuming everybody adapted to climate change, the unknown unknowns are possibly underestimated. With 2000 gt more CO2 this is a completely different planet and there might be no technical solutions to the full spectrum of rising social tenses, when a billion people <i>and</i> their jobs are forced to move, because of rising sea level or too much or too less rain. To develop sophisticated solutions like synthetic biology you need places where weather is of no concern and only a few places will remain when temperatures rise by 4 and more centigrades.<p>So in short C. Stross painted a rosy future where technology - like in the past - solves everything. But he overlooked game changers like the permafrost bomb, a burning Amazon rain-forest and all upcoming social implications.<p>I'll give an example: In 2010 the jet streams stucked over South Russia and Pakistan and brought heat over Russian fields and devastating floods in Pakistan. As a result food prizes exploded, Russia stopped exports leading to food riots in the Arabian world and finally sparked revolutions.<p>Sure, there is no proof of one event based on the other. Anyway, there is no science available to estimate social consequences of climate change, but does that mean it will have none? Just think of the secured gas transports in NYC after Sandy. How many days longer with limited supply and it would gone worse?

Still, I hope I haven't hurt anyone's feelings, yours or some other reader's, with what I wrote. My point was not so much to say ""both groups are exactly equal in the discrimination they experience"", but rather to raise awareness that there is, in fact, discrimination happening against nerds. People today are more sensitive to gay rights, and imagining that an article was about gays rather than nerds might help illustrate potential problems in that article.<p>That said, let me point out one more time that I do not think that this particular article is especially bad. I've written it before that for the most part it is a fair depecition, yet it cannot resist the temptation to throw in some of the same old cliches that are well-suited to manifest a certain discriminatory picture of nerds.<p>If you are right and the number of flattering articles is improving all the time, that would be a very welcome development.
