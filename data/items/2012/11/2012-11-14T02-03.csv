4781794,comment,4777899,4781676,1,0,msandford,,,"A regular average would suggest that the basket of goods used to compare from interval to interval does not change.  In other words, a 1lb ribeye in 1950 is the same as a 1lb ribeye today (in quantity, not price).  If it's included in the CPI then the price increase is reflected properly.<p>Using a geometric average implies that the basket of goods selected CHANGES depending on the change in prices.  So in 1950 when a ribeye was cheap, 1lb of it was included in the basket of goods.  Now that it's more expensive, only 0.5lbs of it are included in the basket.<p>This is a made up example.  Prices are not correct.  Just for illustration.
1950:
hamburger - $0.50/lb
ribeye - $2/lb
arithmetic mean: (2 + 0.5) / 2 = $1.25
geometric mean: sqrt(2<i>0.5) = $1.00<p>2012:
hamburger: $3/lb
ribeye: $18/lb
arithmetic mean: (3 + 18)/2 = $10.50
geometric mean: sqrt(3</i>18) = $7.34<p>Arithmetic inflation: 10.50/1.25 = 8.4
Geometric inflation: 7.34/1 = 7.3<p>The geometric mean has two wonderful properties:
1.  It makes the average price lower by adjusting the quantities included based on their relative prices
2.  It makes the inflation over time seem lower as well<p>I'm not saying that this is some giant conspiracy by ""the man"" to ""keep us down"" but I would argue that it's intellectually dishonest.<p>In order for the CPI to be useful to make comparisons from one year to another the quantities of goods in the basket have to remain constant.  Since the geometric mean effectively varies the quantity in the basket (relative to arithmetic) I would argue that it robs the CPI of any power to provide real comparisons.",1352861616

As marketers got better and the algorithm improved, the ads gained relevance to the user and became more valuable.

The best ad is indistinguishable from content<p>We can expect to see Facebook deemphasizing traditional advertising units in favor of promoted news stories in your stream. The reason is that the very best advertising is content. Blurring the lines between advertising and content is one of the most ambitious goals a marketer could have.<p>Bringing earnings expectations into this, the key to Facebook 'fixing' their mobile advertising problem is not to create a new ad-unit that performs better on mobile. Rather, it is for them to sell the placement of stories in the omnipresent single column newsfeed. If they are able to nail end-to-end promoted stories system, then their current monetization issues on mobile disappear.<p><pre><code>    I still hope it's rather their users who will disappear.</code></pre>",1352861174

4781774,comment,4781482,4781482,3,0,gojomo,,,"Great analysis. 'Like-gate' is a narrow name for the controversy, though, with its political-scandal undertones and narrow focus on 'likes' and FB pages. This same battle is happening elsewhere, like in Twitter's 'omnipresent single column newsfeed' and Google's analogous prime mental real estate.<p>(I don't yet have a more broad and vivid name, but it should evoke the idea that this is a battle to enclose/own/monopolize parts of people's attention/mind/voice, subtly enough they don't recoil away.)<p>I think the 'single column newsfeed' will soon be recognized, despite its usefulness, as a somewhat abusive interface pattern. It artificially heightens the sense of novelty by mixing very unlike (and often repetitive) items. It artificially heightens the sense of urgency with the rapid decay of position down the page. Such 'cognitive sweeteners' bring more attention and excitement in the present but ultimately aren't good for the audience: they're noise rather than signal. Eventually countervailing habits will develop.<p>I wonder if that's what's in it for Caldwell's App.net. Facebook and Twitter <i>can't</i> let users break out of their false-prioritized presentation, without breaking their promotional business models. So anything which better ranks, summarizes, and filters items for a user's attention is a potential threat. Not so on App.net: there you might pay for a less-abusive interface (advanced, non-sugary reading software).",1352861049

If a user sees an ad on Google it is almost certainly comparable or better than organic results with respect to RELEVANCE TO THE USER, which is what matters. Users express their intent, and Google only shows ads alongside the content that are directly related and aiming to solve the same problem or achieve the same goal.<p>On Facebook, what is the parallel? I'm on Facebook so that I can keep in touch and communicate with my friends. My intent is to see stories about my friends about their social interactions, parties, etc. I want to find something to do and see what they've been up to. I want to see the cool new product they bought in action and pictures from the amazing vacation they took - what I don't want to see is that they bought /something/ from Amazon or that they're planning a trip I'm not invited to.
