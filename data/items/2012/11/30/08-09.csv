In fact she believed that the suffering of the poor was a good thing and denied painkillers to be administered for that reason (while she was always receiving painkillers for her own medical issues).  Sure, she funded a lot of what she called ""houses of the dying"" where people were left to die instead of often easily treated with antibiotics, but she only really cared about her missionary work.",1354265923

Generally I open a new urxvt/terminator for a new grouping. A rails project is in its own terminal, a django project in another.<p>> I need to move to the 4th tab either by switching tab few times, or knowing the index of the tab to get a faster shortcut. Both, in my opinion, are not simple.<p>I have this in my conf:<p>unbind '""'\nbind '""' choose-window<p>I generally have more than 10 tmux windows open. Either I know which index is which(rails project - 0 is vim, 1 is server, 2 is console, 3 is dbconsole, 4 is tail logs, 5 is for running tests...), or I select the windows.
