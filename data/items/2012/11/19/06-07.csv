That's what they do, or at least that's what they've done until now.<p>Is it really that hard for a company like Microsoft to find 100 software companies / developers and entice them to port 100 quality apps on their App Store, such that those apps are available when Win8 launches? Answering no to this question ignores the reality. Microsoft can do this and the fact that they didn't shows that they are losing their core competency.<p>And let's be honest here - Microsoft is late from all perspectives. Microsoft is late in the mobile game, being a distant fourth, behind Android, iOS and even Symbian.  Microsoft is also late in delivering an App Store for the desktop. Their only ""innovation"" is this hybrid Windows that can run on both tablets and the desktop, except for their sad reality that consumers expectations have already been set by iOS and Android to the point that consumers don't expect their mobile devices to run the same desktop apps they've been using ... and if those apps won't be optimized for Windows 8, then it's going to be a shitty experience anyway, hence why your apologetic argument is not acceptable for Microsoft.",1353307950

I could write a book about the issues each of the above visas have, but I want to keep this post light as its a complicated subject.</i><p>Let me quote from the regulations.  You need either a Nobel Prize <i>or</i> any three of the following:<p><i>Receipt of nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence in the field of endeavor<p>Membership in associations in the field for which classification is sought which require outstanding achievements, as judged by recognized national or international experts in the field<p>Published material in professional or major trade publications, newspapers or other major media about the beneficiary and the beneficiarys work in the field for which classification is sought<p>Original scientific, scholarly, or business-related contributions of major significance in the field<p>Authorship of scholarly articles in professional journals or other major media in the field for which classification is sought<p>A high salary or other remuneration for services as evidenced by contracts or other reliable evidence<p>Participation on a panel, or individually, as a judge of the work of others in the same or in a field of specialization allied to that field for which classification is sought<p>Employment in a critical or essential capacity for organizations and establishments that have a distinguished reputation</i><p>Now comes the hacking bit: can you map any three of those broadly written requirements to three specific achievements a 23 year old programmer could have within two months of setting out to have them?  Empirically, more than a few people can.  (I'm constrained about what I can tell you about individual folks.)<p>e.g. While I'm an American citizen and thus wouldn't have to worry about it (the relevant criteria for my Japanese visa are, obviously, different), I could present a fairly strong case for an O1 visa on the basis of:<p>1)  I have been published in a major CS journal.  (ACM reprinted a blog post of mine.  Totally counts.  I'm pretty sure you can make ""Guest posted for Smashing Magazine"" into one of your three points, if that seems unlikely.)<p>2)  My salary is high (i.e. ""at least as high as a starting grad at Google""), as evidenced by copious paper I could produce on that topic.  Not a high bar for any engineer to hit.<p>3)  I judged a hackathon once (""participated on a panel as the judge of work of others..."").  (<i>So</i> not kidding.  Bureaucracies are state machines.

The average developer salary is $92,000 per year, which works out to around $45/hr if we assume a standard work week. The rule of thumb is that you need double or even triple of what you are paying your employees in order to be able to afford to employ them. Even if you are the business owner and employee, you still need to recoup the costs of running the business for yourself so the math remains the same. It seems the bare minimum you could charge for the average developer is $90/hr, which is just shy of the $100/hr. quoted. Above average developers will require much more per hour.<p>You could, perhaps, charge way less if you hired below average developers, but that seems to fall under the first category and not the one the parent is referencing.
