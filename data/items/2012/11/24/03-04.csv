I'm the designer of the Sublime Text UI theme and Jon was adamant about making the tab background using the color of the theme background color. It was really, really hard (lots of PNGs and lots of switching between PNGs depending on the luminosity of the background color, lots of pixel tweaking) and it's not perfect for all luminosity values, but these screenshots make it look pretty snazzy :)",1353729509

Anything more was perceived as wasteful and misallocation of resources.

It's easy to blame the toxic waste dump because that intuitively makes sense, but without any hard data, it's hard to draw a <i>scientific</i> conclusion.  Elevated background radiation simply doesn't cause that many additional cancer deaths.<p>I read this article today which does a decent job of estimating cancer deaths based on a certain amount of exposure: <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444772404577589270444059332.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000087239639044477240457758...</a><p><i>Some locations recorded doses as high as 22 rem (total exposure before evacuation). Afterward, the levels of radiation dropped quickly; the largest component came from iodine, and its level dropped by 50% every eight days.<p>How many cancers will such a dose trigger? To calculate an answer, assume that the entire population of that 2-rem-plus region, about 22,000 people, received the highest dose: 22 rem. (This obviously overestimates the danger.) The number of excess cancers expected is the dose (22 rem) multiplied by the population (22,000), divided by 2,500. This equals 194 excess cancers.</i>",1353726769

For example, deleted uranium has been seen to cause very similar issues, but nearly all of the issues associated with depleted uranium come from the fact that it is a heavy metal, not terribly unlike mercury.  Issues caused by the <i>radioactivity</i> of the <i>obviously</i> lightly radioactive depleted uranium are minimal (if indeed present) when compared to the other issues.<p>Those people do not have the luxury of conducting scientific experiments, but <i>we</i> still have the <i>responsibility</i> to accurately report what is going on.  This is important because inaccurate reporting can cause an unjustified marginalization in the future, if it is later discovered that the <i>radioactive</i> effects of the pollutants were not to blame.  For example, if you frame an argument against depleted uranium munitions as <i>""this stuff is radioactive!""</i>, you are going to lose valuable support and sympathy when it becomes clear that the radioactivity in depleted uranium does not account for the wide range of symptoms that you originally attributed to it.<p><i>""The food they are eating is radioactive""</i> by itself, means next to nothing.  It is true of <i>all</i> people.  At least give us the radioactivity in estimated banana equivalent dosage.",1353726288
