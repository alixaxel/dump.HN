Reynolds, Eli Whitney, and a fair number of others who are in our history books, whose names have entered the common vernacular, or both. I'm playing Devil's Advocate here, but it's still a serious question: is the reason we don't hear about the Stallmans of their eras in similar fashions because there simply weren't any, or because as it turns out, it's not the successful industrialists who end up in the dustbin, historically speaking?<p>I don't mean to downplay Stallman's contributions, and as maddening as I frequently find him I think he makes some very important points. The software world needs people like him. But I honestly think anyone who imagines that Stallman is going to be a household name in 70 years while Steve Jobs and Bill Gates will be forgotten is engaging in a hell of a lot of wishful thinking. I do hope Stallman is remembered then (and ideally favorably), but Jobs and Gates undoubtedly will be.<p>(As an aside, I think it's somewhat interesting that Jobs is the current decade's boogeyman, while Gates was the last decade's. Maybe this is because they're both deserving of it, but I suspect it has a whole lot more to do with ""tall poppy syndrome"" than we care to admit.)",1353723077

4824317,comment,4824200,4824200,6,0,mjn,,,"While the article discusses using --word-diff to <i>view</i> changes by-word rather than by-line, which fixes the problem of paragraph reflows cluttering up the diff display, the bigger problem I've had is that it's not entirely obvious how to <i>patch</i> in that manner. As a result, if two patches touch the same paragraph, they usually conflict. You could avoid that by using the classic researcher approach to collaboration: taking locks on sections. But if you're going to do that, SVN is actually better, because you can break out the sections into separate files, and use SVN locking to do the edit-token bookkeeping, rather than having to pass around a ""Mark is currently editing Section 2, pls don't touch"" lock through email or in LaTeX comments.<p>Here's a StackExchange thread discussing possible solutions for finer-grained patching: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5587626/git-merging-within-a-line"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5587626/git-merging-withi...</a>",1353722815
