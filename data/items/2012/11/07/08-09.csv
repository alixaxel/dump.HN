4752773,comment,4749603,4750698,1,0,qxcv,,,"> Why do I need to pick someone who poorly represents my views and will probably vote against my interests, when I could easily vote on actual issues.<p>That's a great idea! In fact, I can see a business opportunity for an enterprising individual (or group of individuals, as it may be) under such a system: one could assemble a team of advisors who would analyse and debate legislation in order to decide on an optimal outcome for the country. Their advice could then be given to paying subscribers, who would vote in accordance with it, and thus pass legislation which benefits the country. If the subscribers disagree with the advisors, then they could subscribe to a different team of advisors after a period of time, and use that team's advice. This way, the subscribers get the benefit of deciding the country's future <i>without</i> the hassle of having to deeply analyse issues each-and-every time a new piece of law comes up. This is especially beneficial if they are not knowledgeable in or care little about a given field, but do not wish to leave legislation of that field to a small, entirely self-selected group of individuals (democracy <i>is</i> about representing the interests of the whole, after all).<p>Yes, I've got the basics all sorted out. To paraphrase Phil Karlton, the hard part is thinking up a name for the damn thing! I was thinking something edgy and retro like ""The Parliament"" or perhaps ""Congress"", but I'm open to other suggestions as well.",1352278661

It's that Silver was able to market the idea that using statistical models is better than a table full of talking heads at predicting an outcome. And that a ""dead heat"" doesn't mean it's a coin flip. In hindsight, it seems almost ludicrous that it hasn't gained greater traction before.<p>He deserves a ton of credit for championing analytics into pop/political culture, but I'm sure we'll see many more models and a lot more statisticians during the next election, some of which will be better than Silver's models (if he's still doing them). I'm all for people asking to see the data instead of the media sound bites.<p>To keep this HN relevant: it was the marketing that drove his startup success. The product (the model) isn't quite perfect and an excellent substitute product was created by someone else in very short order (you).

My question is genuine.<p>Now I do have an idea where trading could be useful.  For instance, a good old merchant doing arbitrage and making a profit is pretty useful: that's how different regions can specialize, do better than they otherwise would, and ultimately lift us from hunter-gatherer tribes where 60% males die a violent death, to our civilization now.  And money, as evil as it may be perceived, is to date the best organizing medium humanity ever had.<p>Investors also have their use: by better allocating money among companies, we could hope to give more money to those who are better at converting it to actual wealth.<p>But.<p>The OP didn't make a ton of money because his model of the the <i>companies</i> had an edge, but because his model of the <i>behaviour of other traders</i> had an edge.  So I fail to see what useful information his trading put into the system.  How his actions resulted in better (or worse) allocation of money between companies. How the (very serious) game he was playing was anything but zero sum.<p>Maybe there's an error in my reasoning.  In this case, I'd happily accept downvotes, but <i>please</i> tell me where I have gone wrong.  Not understanding why one's post is being scolded is just frustrating.

I first thought the calibration was off and tried selecting Jill Stein to actually highlight Obama. Nope. Jill Stein was selected just fine. Next I deselected her and started at the top of Romney's name and started tapping very closely together to find the 'active areas'. From the top of Romney's button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside Obama's name was all active for Romney. From the bottom of that same checkbox to the bottom of the Obama button (basically a small white sliver) is what let me choose Obama. Stein's button was fine. All other buttons worked fine.""<p>However, this test does <i>does not actually demonstrate anything</i>. With resistive and infrared touchscreens, which are commonly used in kiosks, it is entirely possible to have some subsections of the screen work incorrectly, while the rest works correctly. Therefore the fact that some buttons work fine does not prove that the touchscreen is, in fact, correctly calibrated.<p>I've done a lot of work with kiosk touchscreens, and the first culprit I thought of when seeing that video was that the touchscreen was miscalibrated. The second culprit I thought of was that the touchscreen itself was faulty.<p>Resistive and infrared touchscreens are very prone to these types of problems, and I've seen many scenarios similar to this across hundreds of different touchscreens. (Often, just one corner of the screen will go out of wack, while the rest of it works perfectly. I've seen this happen many times.)<p>The only way to know if the screen was actually correctly calibrated is to re-calibrate the screen and see if the issue persists, and if it does, to replace the touchscreen itself (as it could be faulty, not uncommon among cheap touchscreens either). Neither of these steps was performed by the user, therefore he has no way of concluding that the screen was correctly calibrated.

The goal, which is sensible, is to take a more rigorous approach to numbers you hear thrown around like, ""when an incumbent is up by x% y weeks before the election, they win z% of the time"". But even now in retrospect we can't easily evaluate how good those distributions were: we can see how well his point estimate fared, but with only one instance of how the election turned out, can't evaluate his overall picture's accuracy.",1352276739

Prohibition of marijuana is an attack on science and medicine. To outlaw a plant which undeniably benefits cancer and Alzheimer patients [1], and people in excruciating pain is to deny people the will to <i>live</i>. And why? Because a central authority stipulates you shouldn't be allowed to live, if it means you'd ingest a certain plant.<p>Over 4,000 Americans every day are diagnosed with some form of cancer. Meanwhile the government in these situations recommends you heed the advice of your friendly neighborhood big pharma corporation, and heal yourself in a way that makes powerful interest groups millions upon millions of dollars. Otherwise, you might as well just die.<p>This is about giving people in need a second chance at life, at a price they can afford. In 2012, the only reason you would be against legalizing marijuana for medicinal purposes is if you're ignorant, or profiting from it somehow.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/US6630507"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/patents/US6630507</a>",1352275929

4752689,comment,4749574,4751038,1,0,grey-area,,,"To be clear, I was responding to your suggestion that a deliberately spoiled ballot with nonsense candidates written in would be somehow ambiguous - it's not, it will clearly be counted as spoiled (by a human counter at least). For accidentally spoiled ballots, the vote won't be counted if it is not clear - that should be decided by humans, it's more reliable than having machines do it, and frankly it probably only accounts for a very small percentage of votes; it's not a huge problem, and if it becomes statistically significant, <i>the paper ballots can be recounted and verified later</i>.<p>Your picture of a someone inspecting a punch-card is not relevant to most paper voting systems - punch cards are like touch screen machines, they are unreliable technology, and should not have been introduced when the previous system worked perfectly well but just required manpower for counting (which can be mostly volunteers). Even the counting could be automated on paper ballots, but you need humans involved for the ambiguous cases, and I'm not sure automated counting is necessary if you have enough volunteers.<p>Simple paper ballots with a mark inside a square or circle are a tested solution which works well, and leaves an indisputable paper trail in case of recounts. Anything else we've tried just doesn't work as well, though no doubt it has made some companies fabulously rich in suppling the necessary machinery and constantly updating it when it proves to be unreliable.<p>So I'd contend that paper ballots, as used in the UK for example, are better than the computer voting machines available at present. I'm sure one day we'll come up with better machines, but they'd have to be open source, secure, verifiable and incredibly reliable - the antithesis of the machine in the video.",1352275838
