I desperately need your help.<p>Today, my startup, ""Rundown Creator"" (link: https://www.rundowncreator.com/), got a cease and desist letter from a patent attorney.

The one they think I'm infringing is 8,195,515.<p>I responded to the cease and desist letter explaining that my company is small (it's just me), I have no money, and that my product was built and released before their patent application was even filed.<p>They responded telling me their clients have put a lot of money into intellectual property, and that I should lawyer up.<p>I haven't written them back yet.<p>What should I do?<p>Jeff",1352256691

I know this is high frequency, but like I alluded to, you need to make sure that what you're doing isn't replicating the pnl profile of low frequency strategies.<p>So, how did you perform relative to vol sellers? From the market bottom to the end of 2010, the max daily loss for a vol seller was about 3x average daily pnl, and >80% winners. So your returns do sound better, but not incredibly.<p>But, even if you failed to perform as well as vol selling did over the same period, that doesn't negate the strategy's validity. If returns were not correlated, then it's safe to say that you weren't just inadvertently shorting vol.<p>So, start there, work out a regression comparing your daily returns to someone selling vol. Do the same with moving average strategies. Mocking up a simple market making back test versus an ES beta is hard, but that too would be a something to test against. I don't expect you to do any of this, and I'm not going to bother to either. I'm just saying that a complete discussion of this subject would include that information.",1352254032
