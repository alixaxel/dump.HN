4756338,comment,4756229,4756229,12,0,hooande,,,"The author brings up some good points about the potential for arbitrage between prediction markets. But in my experience, intrade has a strong conservative bias. This is more likely a case of people betting on their (incorrect) political convictions as opposed to intentional manipulation.<p>I remember observing a similar thing around the betting on the supreme court healthcare decision. The odds were 3-4 points more against the legislation on intrade than they were on other sites. The comments were overwhelmingly partisan and conservative. ""The Supreme Court will find this unconstitutional because Obama is a socialist.""<p>The idea behind prediction markets is that people will only bet when they know something that the rest of us don't. But we shouldn't underestimate the human ability to convince ourselves that everyone else feels as strongly about an issue as we do.",1352343421

The taxes on upscale hotels (business class travelers, Presumably spending $$$) exceed those on cheap ones, etc.<p>Sure, in the end, it's a tax. No shocker that the better-off pay more.<p>> Also, perhaps as a counter example: Artists, students, and other creative types are now perhaps more likely to use AirBNB than a Hotel, as a base of working in NYC or SF etc. History evidences (globally) creatives tend to inflate real-estate values far in excess of any economic income they themselves capture from employment (in any major urban center). Viz: Soho, Soma, Shoreditch, Berlin, Brooklyn, Paris pre-war, etc.<p>I can only speak for Soma, because I've lived there for 5 years. The inflation in real estate has more to do with lack of supply around the whole city, a booming tech economy, its proximity to most people's workplaces, and relatively cheap price per square foot compared to other neighborhoods in the city (not so much anymore). Not sure artists have anything to do with it.",1352343159

Alternately if there are 10 republicans, 10 democrats, and 80 independents I may have no idea how the independents will vote so AFAIK it's equally likely that either candidate wins.
