It's apparently really common for them to only come to the US for the last few months of the year, set up the kiosks in malls, make a bunch of money, and then go back home. I'm not sure why, but Israel seemed to be a really common country of origin. The mall management in the malls I worked in were okay with the aggressive sales tactics (including following after people) from the kiosk people because they made so much money for the mall itself.<p>The best way I learned to deal with the kiosk people was to just not make eye contact and keep walking if they said anything to me.

4797608,comment,4797461,4797517,27,0,jarrett,,,"It's highly questionable whether a company has the legal authority to retroactively revoke an open source license.<p>The legal doctrine of promissory estoppel is generally considered to protect open source licensees. If you license something for free, and people come to rely on that free licensing, they generally have a right to keep using it, even if you change your mind and try to revoke it later. You can, however, stop licensing the software to new parties.<p>Novus seems to be trying to get around this by claiming that the license was never valid to begin with, because it was issued by a rogue employee. However, I would argue that the doctrine of apparent authority applies here. That is, to a potential licensee, there was no reason to believe that the open source licensing was anything but company-sanctioned. (The rules for apparent authority are actually a bit more nuanced than that, but the main point is the same.) Thus, even if the employee did indeed act without authorization, I think Novus would still be bound by the license.<p>Novus seems to be on shaky legal ground, and I find its cease-and-desist questionable. Unfortunately, it would appear that the recipients of the cease-and-desist opted to comply rather than risk a fight. So the scary thing is not that companies can arbitrarily revoke an open source license--in fact, they can't. Rather, it's that a letter containing vague legal threats can have such a strong chilling effect.",1353140464

What you're invoking is Coase's theorem.<p>You're attacking a strawman, and I said nothing about the Coase theorem. For some criticism of Coase by a libertarian economist see here from page 4 of the PDF: <a href=""http://mises.org/rothbard/lawproperty.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mises.org/rothbard/lawproperty.pdf</a><p>I said, ""Pollution would be treated as a tort."" Nothing really special there because all rights violations would be, viz. we do not believe in victimless ""crimes against society"".<p>I then was mentioning the idea of easement rights in pollution (for more on this cf. from 26 in the above PDF).<p>>A polluting coal plant might cause $1,000 of health damage to each of 100,000 people, and it isn't worth any of their whiles to litigate such injuries. Yet the cumulative impact of such activity is large--the coal plant is essentially ""stealing"" $100m, but getting away with it by stealing a little from a lot of people at once.<p>In common law tradition, people were able to sell their tort claims, no matter how small. Modern authoritarian law prohibits this, there are barriers to class action suits, and so on. We'd like to return to the common law tradition here, so if you are concerned about this, you ought to be on our side.<p>Besides the problem with a governments ability to simply be corrupt, polluters often pay fines to the bureaucracy rather than compensating victims. You are incorrect to automatically assign a $ amount to any claim of this sort. The punishment could involve at least a chance of death and who knows what all these minor health hazards might add up to.<p>Still, the impact of an individual polluter may be seen as trivial, but firms would be able to collectively pursue the torts after buying claims from the victims.<p>I believe in a continuation of good 'governance' after abolishing 'government'. I'm working on some interesting ways in which ""municipal"" service providers might utilize distributed torts against polluters into something resembling various ""social welfare"" programs we have today.",1353139639
