(EDIT: it's my understanding that, due to the current economic climate in Europe, most of these banks aren't hiring).<p>It's a pretty bad place for any passionate programmer to end up. There's an overall lack of passion, risk is avoided at all costs, and creativity doesn't exist. It isn't just in the banks either...there's something culturally different.<p>I've never worked in a factory..but in my mind, it's inbetween working for a real startup and working on a factory floor. Which explains the long hours you mention...when you work 10hours every day, it's hard to be super passionate and creative.<p>As for cost of living. Rent is expensive. If you want to eat at a fancy $300-a-plate restaurant every night, you can (and probably a different one for many months). You can buy fancy clothes and expensive jewelry.
