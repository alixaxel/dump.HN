3508664,comment,3508354,3508557,10,0,bermanoid,,,"No love for Zynga here; the bulk of my rent for the past reasonable stretch of time has been paid for by a Zynga competitor, and a lot of office time has been spent ripping on them for their various tactics. There are many things to hate Zynga for, especially if you've actually talked to people that work there (or that have jumped ship, or they've tried to recruit).<p>But I really don't buy the idea that gamblers are the target market. I know that demo very well, as my previous life was spent running numbers for an online gambling company (my experience with market analysis in that context got me most of my recent work), and I've always been a bit of a poker junkie myself. The Facebook crowd is far more casual, far more female, and far less into tangible, liquid rewards than the gambling crowd.<p>Mistaking the motivations of this crowd is a serious mistake, and if you are under the assumption that the Facebook gaming crowd is made up of Pokerstars castoffs, for the sake of your business I strongly encourage you to reevaluate the situation. While there may be surface similarities in the addictive natures of these games, the people that spend money on gambling are almost always looking for real life gains; this stands in strong opposition to the typical motivation of a Facebook gamer, who is in it for the fantasy alone.<p>I'm not saying that Facebook would not make a great market for real life gamblers, but at the moment, it's not feasible because they don't allow actual gambling. And the real gamblers know the difference - they won't even play on fake money poker sites, for the most part, even the ones that are quite badly addicted to poker. I seriously doubt that they're the same people that sink money into Facebook games to buy virtual goods that let them decorate their farms or give their avatars new haircuts...",1327474287

It was a civil case, and as far as I know he never argued that the information he was being ordered to produce would incriminate him in a criminal matter. His attempts to secure his release involved some conspiracy-theory-level ranting that probably contributed greatly to higher courts ignoring him.<p>A local judge ultimately decided Fine was irrational and keeping him in jail didn't accomplish anything but taking up of jail space and resources.<p>In a criminal matter involving even a hint of self-incrimination, I'm disinclined to think a contempt sentence would be allowed to continue indefinitely by US courts absent an immunity deal.",1327474161

Basically, if a block is going to be used in the HTML as well as elsewhere, you write it normally and then include it with @extend. If a block is only going to be included in other styles, you write it with @mixin and then include it with @include. I think Sasss approach is better because its more flexible  if a style isnt going to be referenced in the HTML, it doesnt clutter up the CSS because it is hidden with @mixin. And if you like Lesss approach better you can just use @extend everywhere.<p>The main reason I prefer Sass is the indent-based and semicolon-less Sass syntax (as opposed to the SCSS syntax).

What I meant was, Apple has a clear business interest in selling access to a 'cloud digital infrastructure'. At first it was iTunes (they sold that access to the record labels, but consumers subsidized that effort), now they are selling it directly to consumers. They also did it with the App Store, then the Mac App Store (they sold access to third-party developers).<p>That's three major forays they have done into the 'cloud services' business, but they have not unified the branding - like Amazon has done. Doesn't mean they are not a heavyweight player.<p>Also, just because they are not competing head to head doesn't mean they aren't competing.<p>GM made trucks, Yamaha made bikes. They don't compete for the same customer, but they do compete for some customers in some market segments. So that makes them indirect competitors.<p>Right now, as it stands, there are some customers (technically oriented) that might have rolled their own iCloud solution on AWS - but now they might not because they can use Apple's. Sure, that's a very small % of the market right now...but my point is that at some point - within the next decade I think - Apple will be more direct. It's only inevitable - assuming they want to keep growing as long as they can.",1327473613

I'm saying that Zynga's ""ripoffs"" have gone from literal feature-for-feature clones to progressively more ""innovative"" titles in the last 5 years.  Back in 2007, my game was the second game Zynga ever copied.  I've been there, I know what it feels like.  It sucks.<p>What I'm saying is that Zynga is aware of their past and is moving towards less copy and more creativity.  I think their <i>actually released products</i> in the last 6 months are a testament to that.  Dream Zoo is a great example of coming into a genre, ""Zyngafying"" it, and coming out with a hit product that's better than the competition.  They even built new tech that they've open sourced and shared with the Cocos2d community.  But no one talks about that because it's easier to hate Zynga than it is to make a reasoned discussion about them.",1327472577
