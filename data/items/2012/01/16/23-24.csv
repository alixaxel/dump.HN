However, I never felt pressure to devote my life to the company, and certainly there was no direct connection between hours worked and compensation.<p>Long term, the biggest personal variables in Google compensation are promotions and stock grants. The biggest determinant of those, in turn (luck and politics aside) is a perception that you're doing important/great work. Burning the midnight oil is not necessarily going to help with that, and it's certainly not the only way to get there.<p>Maybe the culture is different in other parts of the company.

I got out of web dev for companies in San Francisco around the time I saw a client bill and realized they were charging 5-6x my hourly for my work to clients. Still, what you do for a company like Google would be a lot harder to quantify (or explain to a client), and it's probably a lot more personally gratifying.<p>I'm probably an asshole to say this, but I'm reasonably sure I could've gotten a job with Google in 2001-2; and at that point I didn't want to work in that kind of office. I went back to LA and drove a taxi for a year and a half, and wrote a novel, to clear my head.<p>The thing that makes me flinch about it is the competitive nature of the job, even if your job <i>shouldn't</i> have to be competitive. The open offices, the personal time, all of these things make you run <i>faster</i> rather than being allowed to slow down and think. And if you get to thinking about who you're running for...who knows? As insulated as you are from the clients -- which is great -- you also almost never get to see the direct result of your own work. So what emerges is this endless Senior Year of High School, where everyone's waiting to be recommended or get their acceptance letters, while partially slacking off while looking like they're on their best behavior. I'm not sure that's a way I'd be willing to spend my life.<p>I make about 1/5th what you do, probably, for about the same level of work and commitment to my own startup.

I remember asking my interviewer whether I could use things like Google's index if I had a cool 20% idea, and he was like ""Sure.  That's encouraged.  Oftentimes I'll just grab 4000 or so machines and run a MapReduce to test out some hypothesis.""  My phone screener, when I asked him what it was like to work there, said ""It's a place where really smart people go to be average,"" which has turned out to be both true and honestly one of the best things that I've gained from working there.<p>A lot of the observations in the article fall out of this, but in ways that are less sound-bitey.  Google doesn't enforce set working hours - you can get in as late as you want (the latest I've been in is around 4:15 PM, but that was because I had a DMV appointment, the latest from just not waking up was about 2:00), stay as late as you want (my latest was about 1:00 AM, though I worked from home until 6:00 AM last Thursday), duck out during the day if you're meeting a friend or have a date or need to pick a sick kid up from school, or work from home as necessary.  You also don't have a set workload: you do as much work as you think is appropriate and then go home.<p>The thing is - you are surrounded by incredibly intelligent & fiercely hard-working people.  Many of them were used to being top-dog at whatever institution they came from before - hell, many <i>were</i> top dog (we have a lot of ex-startup-founders; there's a good chance that you're working with someone that's founded a company or originated a successful open-source project).  And that can be a big adjustment, and the types of folks that Google typically hire usually react to not being on top by working harder.  It's up to you to set limits on the amount of time you're willing to spend working, and most new hires at Google are used to being limited by ""the amount of work my boss/professor/thesis advisor throws at me"", not by the number of hours in the day.",1326757397

3473107,comment,3472857,3472857,19,0,ComputerGuru,,,"<i>The NTFS features we have chosen to not support in ReFS are: named streams, object IDs, short names, compression, file level encryption (EFS), user data transactions, sparse, hard-links, extended attributes, and quotas.</i><p>Of these, I'm sorry to see the demise of sparse files. This was, IMHO, the single most under-utilized feature of NTFS, and I was able to integrate support for sparse files into a number of clients' applications (I'm a low-level consultant and developer) to great effect. While the increasing size of volumes along with the sub-par utilization of this feature makes it an obvious victim when creating a new filesystem and looking for features to drop, sparse files can be amazing for other reasons.<p>One of the advantages of sparse files is that they can be used to naively support certain seek-related behaviors. If you create the file right, you can save yourself a lot of code and complexity in any applications consuming that data.<p>The biggest advantage of sparse files though is speed. For instance, you can create a container file of X size filled with zero bytes, and only use as much space as the end application requests (for example, creating a virtual disk of 2TB that only takes up 100MB on disk).<p>I, for one, am sad to see this feature go. For anyone interested in this amazing feature, have a read here: <a href=""http://www.flexhex.com/docs/articles/sparse-files.phtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flexhex.com/docs/articles/sparse-files.phtml</a>",1326757193

The foundation can be the legal guardian of copyrights and trademarks associated with a project. Copyrights and trademarks have to be owned by someone -- even if you're open source. Having a foundation provides a way to have some public governance of those legal instruments, instead of having them held by an individual or private company.<p>Secondly, there's the community organization benefits. If anyone wants to donate money to a project, someone has to accept that money. Having a foundation provides a entity that can accept that money, and then distribute it. As an added bonus, it means that money can be donated in a tax-attractive way (the DSF is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit, so donations are tax deductible in the US), which makes it easier to attract donations.",1326755391
