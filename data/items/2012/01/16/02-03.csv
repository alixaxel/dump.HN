For instance, Q according to the Dvorak labels would actually execute X for cut, but you can still type a q by pressing the same key without Command.<p>The other solution is that it lets you globally remap keyboard shortcuts of menu items, in System Preferences > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Application Shortcuts.
