Trains run every 2-15 minutes depending on destination and time of day.  Taxis and buses cover areas that don't have rail directly.  Shopping malls, work centers and sometimes even apartment buildings are often connected directly to rail stations.  Everything is automated, with service points for exceptions.  They use an RFID refillable cash card that is also accepted at convenience and grocery stores (Octopus card).<p>Not only is it easy to get around in HK without a car, it's often easier than driving, parking, tolls, etc (owning a car is a huge status symbol).<p>Whenever I think about mass transport, I'm reminded of the Planetary Transit System [1] from Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri game...

I have requested a list of countries and the amount our country spends on foreign aid.\nWhy do our tax dollars and weapons end up in terrorist countries. I have assembled and installed the fire bottle wiring harness on board the CH-46 helicopter. It has been my honor and priviledge to serve our Marine's in a civilian capacity. I am a dyed in the wool patriot. I want to make a difference. Instead of our tax dollars going to places that hate or guts, keep it and spend it on our defence. The people in Washington think we are all a bunch of idiots. I not Einstein, but I know when I am watching the characters in the story ""The Emporer's New Clothes"".<p>Planned Parenthood is another concern. I guess the politicians think it saves money in the long run to have these lives nipped in the bud.\nBut how wrong they are. They are only Shooting themselves in the foot. Guilt is very expensive. Men and women can say they don't feel bad after an abortion, but they are in denial. To numb the pain the numb out with drugs, alcohol, sex, gambling, and anything else that gives an artificial pleasure. I have killed to of my sons, paid for out of my pocket. But I have costed tax dollars for mental health treatment and medications. I have self mutilated, overdosed, lifted things too heavy for a small person to lift as punishment for killing my own flesh and blood. This caused insurance rates to go so high they were unaffordable. Now I am no longer able to pay my bills because of my mental and physical pain. It would have been so much easier to have had my children and let them grow into productive adults like their sisters.\nPlease help me be heard. The government doesn't care about people. If I could be heard just one time I know I would make a difference.<p>Best regards,<p>Karen Willis Hamilton<p>karenwillis.hamilton@yahoo.com",1327629279

Everything else we are doing here is free, surfing, swimming, snorkeling, hiking, going to the lava etc.  The entire trip is costing us less than $2,500 for our family of 6 to fly to Hawaii and spend 16 days with our friends.  I've saved money money on just about everything.  I'm not sure it's possible for this trip to have cost any less than it has.
