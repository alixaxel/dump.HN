Why did you bother going to the doctor in the first place if you weren't going to follow her advice?<p>The only people who should be selectively following medical advice are people who have made an effort to understand the science behind the advice.  The more serious the condition, the better your understanding of the treatment ought to be before you disregard advice.<p>If a patient has a working understanding of what bacteria are, and how antibiotics work [2], then the patent understands why taking antibiotics for W (where W<X) days might be bad.  The reasoning, roughly, is that fewer resistant bacteria will be killed, making you more likely to infect others with resistant strains between when you stop taking it on day W and when you become non-infectious.  That sort of patient can do whatever she wants for all I care.  She's likely to make a decision that's at least as informed as the doctor's.<p>That type of patient would never ask why X matters.<p>[1] Determining X on a per-case basis would involve way too much testing, so the medical community reaches a consensus based on studies (which may or may not be any good), and prescribes drug X for time T based on that consensus.  Even if you could afford to get fast test results every few hours to monitor your infection status and see how well the antibiotics were working, and even if you could see what percentage of your infectious colony is resistant, you probably wouldn't want to.  Spending that much time in a hospital or clinic is way more risky -- MRSA loves hanging out in those places -- than spending an extra day or three taking antibiotics even if fast accurate tests might show that you don't need to.<p>[2] It's not binary.  It's all about how different concentrations of antibiotics result in different rates of bacterial survival.  In any colony of clinically significant size, there are going to be different rates of resistance.",1326537393

Unless you mean the philosophical ideal of empirical research, in which case I would say that your view of the situation is flawed. It's only really true for simulation experiments, like those that try to simulate the entire universe, from a uniform inflation onwards. Few discoveries have been made that way though.<p>The use for limited-application theories is obvious. With the exception of lithography for chip design, all of electronics works with classical electricity theories. All of architecture, by now capable of constructing objects that are several kilometres high, works on classical mechanics. All of computer science works on ZFC, when it's obvious that real machines don't actually implement that. Or dumb mistakes in algorithms that are ""assumed correct"" anyway because we don't know how to fix them (such as several tree traversal techniques claimed to be O(N) yet in reality more like O(N^2) because they fuck up virtual memory by allocating memory like Obama allocates money.<p>Hell, I'm told that even ITER's reactor design is tested with classical simulations, with one or two correction factors to ""compensate"" for quantum phenomena (but not using the quantum formulas, because that doesn't work). Even inside the LHC 99% of the design is made using classical formulas, basically everything except the targets.<p>Physics itself could be said to use pre-Godel mathematical models (since we haven't quite figured out how to fix the problem Godel pointed out while getting pelted with tomatoes, that's more of necessity than stubbornness of course).<p>The reality is that science is back in the 1900's before Einstein : we have several big flaws in our theories staring everyone in the face, making lots of people angry. At the same time scientists are telling everyone that science will solve every problem very soon now (or at least not contradicting it). In the meantime nobody has any clue how to fix the gaping holes in our most fundamental theories.<p>Maybe it's time we did an exhaustive search of patent offices and Italian kindergarten teachers ...",1326536488

It's always harder to evade a security threat when you don't know what it is or looks like.<p>Another thing that annoys me is that people push for more railways on the basis that it is safe than flying.  Railway in the last 10 years has had more crashes and more terrorist incidents than flying, and a determined terrorist can create massive havoc, fear and deaths from targeting trains, as was tragically displayed several times.<p>But for some reason, you can still hop on a train with no screening.  Go figure.",1326535975

They claimed they were dangerous to other road users. TfL disputes this.<p>Solving the overcrowding issue is more complicated than building higher capacity buses - you have to think about the speed of boarding, route layout, speed of navigating London's congested streets, fare evasion and more.  In some places, the bus stops allow for two bendy buses or 3-4 regular buses to board at once, which means faster boarding on regular buses during peak times.<p>The new Routemasters, with 3 doors and 2 staircases, might prove to reduce overcrowding despite their lower capacity.",1326535870

This has nothing to do with ""medicines being outdated"", it has to do with correct and disciplined usage of antibiotics.<p>Norwegian hospitals use forms of penicillin which simply do not work on patients from countries where antibiotics usage is more lax. Treating a patient from Spain with the same penicillin which is used for Norwegian patients would not have any effect and kill the patient. This is _solely_ because poor discipline in drug usage leads to antibiotics-risistant bacteria.<p>What needs to be done, and globally, is to<p>1) Stop treating livestock with prophylactic antibiotics\n2) Stop prescribing antibiotics for conditions where it doesn't work (just because the patient has a cold and is complaining ""can't you give me something?"")\n3) _Force_ patients to take their entire antibiotics course so even the small but drug-resistant minority of bacteria is killed off by the immune system and not transmitted further.<p>If the global community fails to do this, we will in the worst case end up with a world which looks the way it did in the 1800s - a simple bacterial infection will kill you, because it can't be treated.<p>This is a question of disciplined usage of medicines, not researching new and clever ways to kill bacteria. We can't eradicate every dangerous strain of bacteria on earth - it's simply not feasible.",1326535497

Spring) have a heavy reliance on JavaBeans. Once you start using objects everywhere as JavaBeans, you've no choice but to add them. And the IDE makes it trivial. Yes, there's constructor instantiation in most DI containers, but it's not frequently used.<p>I do agree that most modern languages have a much more elegant solution for this.",1326535386
