Scoble interest is to get traffic from everywhere. Raising awareness, brand recognition, etc. Google+ was skyrocketing at the beginning and for already known Internet celebs an opportunity to easily scale on another platform because at that time they were the first on Plus and quickly got traction through existing fans. And as known Internet addicts they cannot just ignore a platform. So it's a mutual and balanced relationship reach (for Scoble) vs content (for Google). Compare also other bloggers/publisher who spammed from day 1, e.g. Pete Cashmore from Mashable.<p>2.) There are lots of high, high level Google execs who never used Google+",1325486749

(reached 48 points)<p>pg has resubmitted this 2 weeks later, using the subtitle of the article, ""The way people copy each other's linguistic style reveals their pecking order.""  (so far 96 points)<p>Now I'm not nitpicking about credit, I don't care. My question is to what degree is this submission getting more traction from pg's status, and to what degree is it getting more traction due to the linguistic choice of a more specific, better(?) title?<p>I'd say pg, at least here on HN, is higher up in the pecking order than the person who submitted the article first (llambda).<p>On the other hand, the subtitle is certainly more descriptive, since computer scientists have been making algorithms to measure human pecking orders for a while, with large companies seeking to build brand confidence by giving away their products to ""influential individuals"", etc.<p>This is different than the effect described in the article. The original article contrasts their new work with previous approaches that focus on structural/network effects: who's talking to whom, etc.<p>I guess what spiked my interest is that your power and/or reputation still affect the linguistic choice of whether to respond at all.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3385517"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3385517</a>",1325486703

Great art is always connected to the lowly and the popular. Disdain for that which is not ""advanced"", imagining barriers between high and low, is associated with nothing so much as creative exhaustion. It's the mentality not of the artist but of the critic, and the second-rate critic at that.<p>It's ironic that you would pick a couple of jazz musicians to illustrate this, since for most of its formative history jazz was derided as a vulgar form. Only in later stages was it championed by the priests of ""advancedness"". This is a sign of decadence. When the Davises and Minguses appear, that is the late-blooming of a genre, and by the time the scholars move in, the muses for the most part have moved on.

The same economic incentives which drive cattle producers to lock-in the prices at which they will sell their cattle at the same time as they lock-in their feed prices exist for car service.  Thinking about staying at the swanky hotel that's located a few miles from the party?  Buy a forward contract on car service at the same time you book the room.<p>The issue I see is that, without standardization of ""product"", it would be hard to create an active marketplace.  To a driver, taking someone away from the city to the suburbs isn't as valuable as a route which leads to another customer's point of departure.  This, of course, implies that the drivers would also be participating in the futures market.  If they noticed, before considering taking NYE off to be with their families, that they could earn $200/hour, they might reconsider.<p>Furthermore, would customers be willing to lock-in service at a particular time?  What if the party is still going strong at your appointed time?  You could sell your service slot to someone else, but would you be willing to put your contract up for sale while sipping a martini with your significant other?  Is there a market design which provides sufficient certainty and price/demand visibility in a way where transactional costs don't destroy the value proposition?<p>Perhaps the ubiquity of pocket ""trading terminals"" will usher in a new era of dynamic pricing which will require the design of new market models?
