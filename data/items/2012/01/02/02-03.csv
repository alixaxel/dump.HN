One of the best things about HN is how international the community is here--Americans like me may make up the plurality of users, but there are users from all over the world. I have a question for all of you who know news sources from outside the ""inner circle"" of traditionally English-speaking countries: what news sources do you recommend (in the English language, for this question) published in places where many readers use other languages? A while ago on Hacker News there was a discussion about whether a story from India came from a reliable source, and there was a subthread about which newspapers in India are most objective and do the best job of checking facts. Similarly, there is a vigorous English-language press in Pakistan, in several ASEAN countries, and in a variety of countries in Africa. I'd like to hear from knowledgeable readers how the different sources from different countries compare as reliable sources of news.<p>For finding (and commenting on) new stories submitted to Hacker News, what are news sources with good reporting on science and technology developments (always interesting topics here) and what are news sources that accurately report economic trends or business stories of interest to hackers, start-up founders, or investors?

3414587,comment,3414211,3414211,0,0,MBCook,,,"When the Pre came out, both my brother and sister bought one. They both liked iPhones, but couldn't get them because they were on Sprint. I had an iPhone 3G.<p>They didn't like the keyboard, and the fact that I could grab the top and bottom half of the phone and twist them at least 10 degrees relative to each other was rather worrying. The Touchstone was fantastic, and I assume the only reason no one else has done it was because it's patented. However since the Touchstone cost $70 the only person I know who had one got it for free when their phone (when they were given away at some sales conference long after it was clear the phone was dead).<p>I though WebOS was very nice, and my siblings liked it. I did just a teeny bit of development for it, and thought it was a decent environment. I liked the documentation, and it was pretty easy to do. The simulator, which ran on VirtualBox (IIRC), was slow as hell. The phone liked to use gestures to trigger things, which was a bit unintuitive and was very difficult to trigger in the simulator.<p>However, I thought the card metaphor was fantastic. At the the time the iPhone didn't allow any multitasking at all. I still think the card metaphor is elegant. My mother has had an iPhone for two years and still doesn't know about the multitasking or how to close apps if she wanted to. They Apple or Google could buy just the card metaphor patent for a few million, I would say ""do it"".<p>But I always thought the main failing was apps. By the time the Pre came out the iPhone app store was already huge and <i>the</i> reason to get an iPhone. After a few months, Palm finally announced an app store and... nothing happened. It took months and months before they actually opened the store and let people download things. After it was open, only one or two apps would come out each month. The ones that did gave the impression the internal developers were making them as demo apps. If Palm had paid a few big app developers to port their apps, it would have gone a LONG way.<p>From the end user's point of view, the app market situation was a fiasco. The time between the announcement of the store and starting to get any recognizable apps was eons.<p>It doesn't surprise me that HP didn't fix things. The Touchpad was nice, but overpriced. The fact the first thing HP said was ""We're putting it on our printers"" wasn't reassuring in any way.",1325472904

We can predict lying, age, gender, and power using them. For those interested in this it would be worth checking out The Secret Life of Pronouns[1]<p>Your second paragraph talks about being able to notice these things in meetings. Penbrooke's research[1] shows that our brains ignore structural words. So it's pretty impossible to take advantage of this particular research.<p>However, I think there are a few things you can do.<p>1. You're first paragraph about ""inside jokes"" is spot on. When I was in college it was pretty common to to get what were called ""Dorm Floor"" shirts. The front had some slogan or name on them and the back had quotes from your dorm floor. When we went to create ours there were three of us who dominated the floor quotes. So they made a limit for how many  quotes a person could have. Most of these quotes were essentially inside jokes.<p>If you want to know where you stand in a group it's pretty easy to test this using inside jokes. Can you start something? If they respect you they will pick up your inside joke.<p>2.When I was in college, I took a lot of discussion based classes related to political theory. I noticed my self picking up the mannerisms of a kid in my class. I then realized that others were too. This was a huge eye opening experience for me. I realized that mannerism and the way we speak is organic and if we can record it's evolution it tells us something about how power and society works.<p>The down side of this is that in a meeting you don't see the birth of the mannerism so you don't know who the decision makers are. You also can't mentally process the structural words, so I don't think there's much advantage there.<p>[1]<a href=""http://secretlifeofpronouns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://secretlifeofpronouns.com/</a>",1325472190

I probably thought about it too much. The result was that I ended up pursuing it to its conclusion as far as my abilities went and then feeling like I had nothing left to do but flog a dead horse with the same improvisational tricks. Then I got tired and rusty.<p>(Any tips from musician hacker types here on how to get past this kind of 'improvisor's block' ?)<p>I guess my advice with hindsight would be: trying to get better by being cleverer with harmony hits a dead end. Instead try to get to a point where you can feel harmony in a textural way. Theory can help with that, but a little of it goes a long way, try to get as much as you can just from playing and listening. Watch out though as it's easy to get stuck in a feedback loop doing that which converges on a local optimum that bores you. Seek input into the loop which is outside your improvisatory comfort zone. And not necessarily in the sense of technically harder -- just different.<p>The best stuff I've been able to play has been when I'm in a state of mind when I'm able to play texturally without thinking very much about what I'm playing, but it's quite rare these days.",1325471948

3414555,comment,3413740,3414152,0,0,nandemo,,,"> Does anyone know historically how C13 got to mean ""C+E+G+B♭+D+F+A"" rather than ""C+E+G+B♭+A"", which if you consider things only symbolically, seems more likely?<p>Changing the question to C11 to simplify: a possible answer (take it with a grain of salt) is that C11 got to mean ""C+E+G+B♭+D+F"" because in classical harmony you can't just stick a 11th there without the 7th and 9th. The 11th interval (C to upper F) is dissonant; not as much as the 4th, but still dissonant. However, it is consonant with the 7th and 9th. That is, B♭ to F is a 5th, and D to F is a 3rd, or simply: B♭-D-F is a triad.<p>The question now is, why do books say C11 means ""C+E+G+B♭+D+F"" but in practice it's often voiced as ""C+E+G+B♭+F""? I think the simple answer is that in some traditions (like jazz) people are OK with that dissonance; and in some harmonical contexts (when the function of the chord is such and such; say jaylevvit's comment), we can omit such and such notes because the chord still ""works"". If you doubt, play several voicings. The ""proof"" is in the sound.<p>(but honestly I'm not fully convinced by that answer. In particular I dislike the notational mess).",1325471861

Depending on the deal size, this often requires obtaining approval up the chain so that somebody can evaluate and ideally limit the risk involved.<p>I completely agree with this sentiment; sometimes starting work at-risk is a sign of good faith and goes a long way to establishing trust. Just make sure that there is a follow-up plan along the lines of ""I'm working at-risk for X days. If the contract isn't signed by then, or if I've reached the first small milestone/chapter/deliverable, I stop work.""<p>Except, in this case, it seems the OP actually had a signed contract (half way through his timeline) but Apress still refused to cough up the payment that they obligated themselves to pay.

This also means that if Tumblr is down or is hacked or you want to customize something beyond the theme, you are dependent on Tumblr...<p>So, while each may have its own use-case (Tumblr is great for the following/reblogging stuff), the fact that WordPress is regularly updated is not a reason to avoid using it as a platform.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wordpress.com/stats/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wordpress.com/stats/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://wordpress.org/news/2011/08/state-of-the-word/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordpress.org/news/2011/08/state-of-the-word/</a>",1325471005

I am not a developer, just a consumer, so my comments may even be irrelevant to the OP.<p>webOS definitely had its rough edges. The phone app will be sluggish (what jwz was referring to, try answering a phone call by tapping ""pick up"" several times without any response as the phone keeps ringing), in USB mode the phone shuts down and directs all voice calls to voicemail, the entire OS does not have a position indicator to tell you how long and where you are in the page, etc.<p>However, all initial releases of software are buggy. As someone already mentioned in this thread ""I think instability is less a sign of architectural problems than of simple failure to iron all the bugs out"". I think everyone at Palm expected to be able to release updates and get the OS up to speed.<p>However, Google started cranking up on Android and left everyone (including iOS) in the dust. I am not talking about UI here. I am talking about sheer speed in the software turnaround cycle. In seemingly no time, Android had Cloud syncing, Maps with Navigation, features in the photo app like red eye removal etc. etc. They just blasted away with these updates. To me it is astounding that a complex mobile OS used all over the world can be developed in such speed. After this effort, webOS just had no chance.<p>You need apps for the tablet but without a successful phone ecosystem, the touchpad was definitely a tough sell. HP thought their ""channels"", ""marketing"" would amount to something. It just wasn't. A CEO wanting to get out of the consumer space finally stopped the bleeding.
