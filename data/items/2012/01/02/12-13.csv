Reintroduce the home cooked meal with plenty of vegetables and little fat. Getting away from the processed foods and especially sugar contents. I remember on an open presentation I attended that they explained how a packet of cookies contained as much energy as an entire dinner, and if you ate it quick enough almost all of it would simply go to fat storage because you couldn't possibly use all that energy fast enough unless you were running the entire time.<p>They said the key to weight loss is not to focus on the weight loss but rather on permanent changes to your diet and lifestyle.

You may only need to care about your specific experiment. Everything else is nothing you should (or need to) care about.\nCompare this to a typical CS PhD student at a German university (e.g. me).
