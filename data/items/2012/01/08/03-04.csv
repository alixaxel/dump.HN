They are after-all working for the same lobbies and part of the same revolving door plutocracy. The right loves to implement legislation that keeps competition out of established players markets, just as the left does. America has not been a capitalist economy for a long time, and a century of ever increasing regulations have accrued to the point that it is starting to crumble. One can say they blame capitalism and cite America as their example, but it calls into question their understanding of economic models, because America does not meet the definition of capitalism and has not in a long time. Plutocracy, corporate fascism, or Corporatism (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporatism</a>) better meet the definition of America. It is pretty safe to say, that when an economy transitions to a centrally planned economy it stops being a capitalist economy. Just because we allow unlimited personal profit (a key tenant of capitalism) does not mean that we meet all the requirements of capitalism. One of the other key tenants (a market free of intervention. AKA government picking winners and loosers) has been missing for a long time.",1325992215
