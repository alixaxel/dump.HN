3498786,comment,3498202,3498729,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"If you want to kill Hollywood, you need to kill its revenue streams. In the case of TV, that would be advertising. The examples you've raised are off to a good start there. Once brands and marketers see that these folks can reach bigger and more dedicated audiences each week than a typical TV show can, dollars will be taken away from TV spend and placed on YouTube instead. It'll be a slow process, but we're already seeing some really big brands and companies placing big bets on YouTube, Facebook, etc. There are plenty of cases where spending on a YouTube star makes more sense than spending on a TV show (when reaching a targeted audience or youth demographics, say). That said, YouTube -- and its associated studios -- have a ways to go before theyr'e taking serious bucks away from TV network advertising.<p>As for the movie business, that one's a bit tougher to kill. The barriers to entry for Hollywood-quality movies are fairly high. But there are some levers to pull. In recent years, hedge funds have quietly emerged as one of the biggest sources of film financing in the business -- bankrolling everyone from production companies to studios themselves. Independent producers looking to work outside the Hollywood system should find a) distribution paths that make sense, and b) court this sort of money, which will be agnostic as to who's making the content if the content is good enough.",1327287485

Hollywood works in the opposite way, with studios competing (and, thus, cutting bigger checks) for good scripts. There are hundreds of ways to sell a script in Hollywood. There's only one way to sell a script on Amazon.<p>So, if your script's been floating around for a year or two and hasn't gotten any traction -- no agent, no options, hasn't made The Black List, hasn't placed in any notable competitions, etc. -- then sure, submit it to Amazon. But the hard truth in that case is that the script is likely just crap.<p>On a side note: the point of writing a spec isn't necessarily to sell it. Specs are to screenwriters as GitHub is to coders.

I'd like to know what happened to that.<p>It wasn't a threat at that point. It was a novelty. It's easy to agree to leave a novelty alone. It's difficult when it's threatening the revenue stream of the guys lining your pockets.<p>> that both parties supported the bills by large margins (or they wouldn't have been reported out of committee) until they got caught<p>Look, as much as we want to believe that our representatives actually <i>read</i> the stuff they're pushing, the truth is, they don't. I would be shocked if a singe member of the <i>committee</i> responsible for the bill actually read the damn thing. Each of them is on quite a few other committees, responsible for quite a few other bills, have speaking engagements, businesses, books they're writing, etc etc.<p>They decide on what to vote for and push based on who's supporting it. Some members of the GOP saw the Chamber of Commerce as a supporter and jumped on board. Commerce = Business = Good. Seriously, that was the thought process.<p>Once they saw the push-back, they realized things were more complicated than that, and dropped support.<p>Can the GOP be a strong ally for leaving the Internet alone? Absolutely. As long as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, etc. line their pockets right before re-election time. If that happens, I promise you, they'll vote for whatever bill the ""Internet"" endorses. Without reading it. It's a promise.",1327285997

But before talking about empathy again, we must show that the distress is its own separate thing (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voight-Kampff_test#Voight-Kampff_machine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voight-Kampff_test#Voight-Kampf...</a>) rather than mere frustration at failed attempts of rescue.<p>So, sure, we've learned <i>something</i>, but I don't think we've demonstrated <i>empathy</i>.",1327285978

For instance, if the rats have figured out that the humans can identify individual rats and treat them different (which they might figure out if the humans have done several kinds of experiments on the same rats because each experiment would have a control group that gets different treatment), the rat outside might think ""the humans but this other rat in the cage--if I let it out, then when they come back they'll be distracted putting it back in, and might leave me alone"".<p>Or maybe it would be good to let the other rat out so that if danger arrives, you can go hide in the cage.<p>Or it could make sense to have the other rat out so that the two of you can more quickly explore the environment and find a way to escape.<p>The main point is that you can't really attribute letting the other rat out to empathy, as there are many other possible explanations for why a rat might let another rat out.",1327285906
