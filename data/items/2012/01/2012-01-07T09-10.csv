3436692,comment,3428427,3430272,2,0,freehunter,,,"The Microsoft Trident engine is getting more powerful with each iteration. Knowing that it has been around since IE4 in 1997 and seeing where it is today show how extensible it is.<p>The real problem lies not inside the engine but inside Microsoft themselves. Specifically, within the .NET group. I know everyone on Hacker News loves Ruby, so I'll use that as an example. Microsoft wanted the dynamic language stylings that Ruby offered, so they spent 3 years developing IronRuby that ran on the .NET CLR. Then they suddenly dropped it without warning. Why? Because they had extracted everything they wanted from it. Keeping the technology up to date would not give them anything more than what they already had. Microsoft benefited from it, and when they no longer did, they dropped it. Everything that happens inside Microsoft's core is to strengthen their sellers: Windows and Office. If Windows or Office needs a new technology, they will take it, use it, and .NET-ify it until it becomes proprietary.<p>If they were to swap Trident for Webkit, it would be the same thing. IE11 built on Webkit for a few years, their development staff would learn from it, and the next release would see Trident 7 (IE12) back in form. Microsoft takes with only nominal giving because that's great for business. They can learn from outside technologies, then use that knowledge to lock people in tighter with better tech.<p>It's been a while since we've seen Microsoft in true form, pioneering and leveraging their weight to shape the market for their benefit. What we have right now is Microsoft in damage control mode. Moving to Webkit would be more of that, strengthening Trident by sucking the essence out of Webkit or Gecko, directing the flow of HTML5 (and pushing for MSHTML6 afterwards) would be the return of the powerhouse. It'll be interesting to see where things go, but even as someone who sees Microsoft as the best tool for the job in some certain situations, I would't place any bets on Microsoft being the dominant force on the web... ever. Luckily (for them), desktops aren't going anywhere anytime soon.<p><i></i>edit - I should add that, to your point (and mine), Microsoft already <i>does</i> use Webkit where it is advantageous for them: Mac OSX. Instead of continuing development on IE for OSX, they switched Office to Webkit for the Mac. I'd have to believe Trident would have suffered without that move (circa Office 2011).",1325929792

3436666,comment,3436244,3436244,58,0,jan_g,,,"The thing (in many European countries) is that government doesn't 'steal' your money, but that out of every salary you have to pay for many different things. Income tax is only one aspect.<p>For those interested, this is the reality in my country, Slovenia, which borders Hungary (I may have botched some numbers regarding taxation, but the principle behind calculations stands):<p>1. Out of every monthly salary you pay: income tax, state/public pension fund, health insurance and also a small tax (<1%) called parental security.<p>2. A woman or a man may take up to 12 months of parental leave, which is fully paid by the state. The government uses money from 'parental security' tax to pay for this privilege. It works, because at any given moment there are many,many more employees not on parental leave than those on parental leave.<p>3. A woman is entitled to sick leave during pregnancy if her doctor makes such decision. So it may well be that she is absent for two years from her job. And it is also true that many women abused this privilege simply by convincing their doctors that they 'cannot perform on the job while pregnant'. A few years ago there's was a sort of clampdown to this practice by tightening the control on the doctors' decisions. So it's not that pervasive anymore.<p>4. A woman is also entitled to reduced workday (only 4 hours instead of 8) while her child is under 6. Her salary is of course halved, but state covers her pension fund as if she worked 8 hours. Many women don't decide to use this option, simply because a halved salary puts a lot of strain to majority of families' incomes.<p>5. Regarding firing workers: similarly to Hungary it's very difficult to fire someone and almost impossible to fire pregnant women or old people. Therefore, majority of people under 35 don't have regular contracts, but they work via independent contracts or the so-called self-employment companies (you establish a company in which you are a sole employee and then go work to another company which pays you via your small company). Needless to say, job security is practically non-existant if you aren't on regular contract.<p>6. Progressive income tax is also here, however it's not as brutal as in Hungary. Lower salaries (<1k euros) are actually not taxed that much. The problem is only that the highest tax bracket (41%) comes already at 2k euros and that hits middle class the most. We, skilled professionals, are usually complaining the most about this fact. There are discussions to change this taxation in order to stem the brain-drain. It's also important to know that progressive taxation is applied on 'past-the-post' principle: e.g. you are taxed 41% only for your income that goes over a certain amount. This means that if your salary is 2k euros, you'll be taxed 41% only on income past 1.5k euros, that is 500 euros will be taxed 41%, 1.5k euros 27%.<p>7. Grey economy/tax evasion is certainly a problem, however the tax bureau is becoming more and more powerful and it's connected with banks. It's actually not that easy to cheat anymore. That goes for majority of people/businesses, richest top 5% still game the system by moving the money to Cyprus/Luxemburg shell companies and so on, but this can't really be helped unless it's solved on EU level.<p>Ok, I'll stop now :-). If you have any further questions, then do ask.",1325929102
