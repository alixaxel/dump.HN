This makes public transport largely uneconomic and unworkable, with certain exceptions (eg parts of Perth, inner Sydney, Melbourne). Even then, that transport is largely limited to going into and out of the city. If you want to go somewhere else it's a huge problem. ...""</i><p>Cletus, Melbournite here. Isn't the majority of the population urban and concentrated on the eastern sea board?  The density is high. The picture you paint of car dependence is not quite as bad as you portray it in Melbourne at least. Public transport is actually pretty good compared to the roads cost wise & safety. It's not at European standards, but Europe is far denser and politically different. It's also hard to lump the cities together. Melbourne has had good public transport, Perth better. Sydney is pathetic. Having said that, if you live outside the 50km zone (less in some capitals) of Melbourne you will either get a car or depend on day and irregular public transport, if at all.<p>The key point to remember here is, traditionally the major capital cities of Australia moved from serviceable public transport to car based travel, only when the sprawl of the 70's occurred where land use, surpassed infrastructure and the will to supply it. Transport moved from communal and ""tax based"" to  private and ""user pays"".",1327636797

Just make a private & empty repo, add a wiki to it, and now you have a wiki you can edit in your favorite editor, search with grep, and save / revert with git.   Back of the napkin estimate, I would say we have 4 to 5 time the activity on the wiki that we did before.

3517089,comment,3516666,3516666,17,0,hncommenter13,,,"This is more of a PR stunt than a winning legal strategy.<p>1. The US government has sovereign immunity (except where specifically waived by law) for virtually all its official acts, unless those acts violate the law or constitutional rights.<p>2. The supreme court has affirmed in a somewhat similar case, Kosak v. US, 465 U.S. 848 (1984), in which a set of paintings were detained (and possibly slightly damaged) by Customs officials.  More recently, the core holding in Kosak was affirmed in Dolan v. US, a case regarding a specific waiver of immunity for the US Postal Service (though the lower court was reversed).<p>3. In a recent series of cases on criminal law (Medellin v. Texas, among others), a majority of the Court made it clear that they do not view decisions of the International Criminal Court as self-executing, meaning that they are to be followed without the ability for the Supreme Court to review them.<p>In other words, this is a real longshot.  At some point, if no criminal case can be proved, the accused may get the servers back (and the users their files).  But if convicted (or if the assets are subject to foreiture as the fruit of illegal activity), there's a good chance those servers are gone for good.<p>Besides, how would the FBI establish that the files were non-infringing and should be returned?  In theory, the DMCA helps guard against this--had MegaUpload actually followed the takedown procedures, the government could have more faith that returning the servers to a surviving entity wouldn't put the same infringing content back online.<p>Imagine a scenario where your financial advisor has control of some of your money and also happens to be a drug dealer or insider trader.  The police bust him and seize his assets, but because money is fungible they can't tell exactly where all the cash came from.  Your money is frozen pending the outcome of the case and a determination which assets should be released.  You can sue the accountant (he had a duty to you), but suing the government isn't going to get you very far.  Not exactly the same, but analogous, to my mind.",1327636328

Melbourne is reasonably dense compared to some other cities I've lived in. Quite a few of my co-workers don't own cars, and none of them drive to work in the city - every one of them walks, cycles, takes a tram or catches a train. Melbourne buses are terrible, but the trains aren't nearly as bad as everyone says. Our trams and cycle lanes are ubiquitous and they're incredible. Most of the hills in Melbourne exist in bike riders' imaginations, though - compared to my native NZ it's dead flat.<p>Having commuted on Brisbane's buses I know they're top notch, and the ferries aren't bad if you're near the river and have some extra time in the mornings. The trains are getting a lot of money thrown at them, too, upping service frequencies and extending them further north.<p>There's definitely cultural lean towards living in the suburbs and having a back yard big enough to play cricket on, but you only really know what you see.

If your product is good, desires repeat orders this can fast grow a nice base of income.<p>Either way a good business needs many nets (marketing revenues) to keep going. this is the first.<p>Secondly is cold calling: used the wrong way it can be painful. Used the right way it can be fun and work well.
For example knoking on doors asking if the owner wants to hold a perfume party will be tough.<p>Taking a stool outside a local supermarket/centre and offering free samples / feedback on what perfumes people prefer can be fun, and lead to: oh i like that where can i get this from...your in.<p>Another good revenue is getting post cards printed - brand them well state your message and leave them on pin boards, at checkouts, take-aways anywhere people go, stand and wait, the dentist, the vet.<p>If your message is good and your product market worthy your be amazed at how much response this will get.<p>Link this all with a website, Facebook the social web and with a good customer attitude towards business and hard work
and i promise you your be amazed at how well it will all turn out.<p>Work hard, work smart be different, stand out.<p>don't be afraid to fail or tumble.

3517042,comment,3516093,3516708,1,0,robomartin,,,"Thanks for your kind words.  In reality I was somewhat headed in that direction.  I started a tech business out of my garage about 12 years ago. Self funded.  A manufacturing business.  Based out of the US.  Tough and capital intensive.  After moving out of the garage I grew it to the point of having, under one roof, just about anything you'd need to design and manufacture quite a range of products: EDA tools, lab, prototyping equipment, fully-stocked Haas CNC shop, etc.  Then 2008 happened.  Long story short, we were not ready for the financial test that the economic downturn brought forth.  After twelve long years of hard work the business went under.  So, yes, I am basically broke.<p>The problem with launching a robotics business is that it is very capital intensive.  And, if it happens to be about humanoid robotics the potential for revenue is fairly limited.  Most real humanoid robotics is still in the research domain. I don't know if I am interested in making toys.  Maybe I should consider it.  Still, making physical products is capital intensive and there's a very long delay between investment and revenue generation.  Unless doing something relatively trivial the runway required is orders of magnitude greater than for, say, an Internet startup.<p>My guess is that there is no way to get into humanoid robotics research without a degree.  Even if one wanted to explore SBIR funding opportunities you need the legitimacy that degrees provide.<p>I don't know everything. In fact, I am keenly aware of just how much I don't know.  However, constant learning is a way of life for an engineer.  And that's exactly what I've been doing my whole life.  This, for me, seems to be one of those ""if you can't beat them, join them"" moments.",1327634723
