They could eliminate all the perks and it wouldn't have made a dent in stock performance.<p>The earnings miss was by about $1/share, or $323M.  That's about $10K per employee over the quarter.  You really think Google spends $10K/employee/<i>quarter</i> on perks?  I've heard numbers for the food costs, and you're overestimating by more than an order of magnitude.<p>I actually think perks today are <i>significantly</i> better than they were when I joined in Jan 2009.  Cafes are open on weekends.  There's more than one option for Friday dinner.  They booked the whole Oracle Arena and took us all to see Cirque du Soleil.  Cake played at Googleween.

Godel's Completeness Theorem says that a first-order theory is consistent if and only if it is true in some model. Therefore, for every undecidable statement there will be a model where it is true and a model where it is false.<p>These models can look very strange. For example, if ZF is consistent, then by the Second Incompleteness Theorem so is ZF + ""ZF is inconsistent"". By the Completeness Theorem, a model for this theory must exist. In this model ZF is inconsistent, so there is a 'proof' of a contradiction from the axioms of ZF. However, since we have assumed the consistency of ZF, such a 'proof' must necessarily involve nonstandard integers.",1327222476

3496013,comment,3495759,3495759,2,0,MattLaroche,,,"One thing this article doesn't point out: it wasn't Google who argued that the supposedly lower salary was offset by food - it was a person (sure, an employee or contractor of Google). Perhaps this person was reading from a recruiting script sanctioned by management. But it wasn't the big overarching company that made this argument to the author - it was a person.<p>Recruiters often have the wrong incentive structure. They have numbers to hit - and so they use classic high pressure tactics (exploding offers, ""accept the offer now"" durring the offer, misinformation, tricks) to convince people to accept. It's unfortunate that the recruiter's goals don't line up with the applicant's, but it's true. How one fixes that isn't obvious to me tonight.<p>I also hate the victim mentality when an employee no longer feels like they're getting what they want from their employer. If you don't like what you're getting, if the economic transaction is no longer acceptable, leave. (I respect employment laws, I think everyone should treat each other, I don't condone abusive behavior or manipulation) Employees aren't victims trapped by evil employers, they're participants in an economic transaction. If the transaction is no longer as profitable as one at another company, then that doesn't make the employer bad or wrong, it's simply time to move on.<p>(I worked at Google for 5 years, I left in April 2011. And when I went back for lunch one day in November with former coworkers, I had the best meal I'd had since I left.)",1327219866

It is one thing to offer free steaks at lunch (a real perk) vs offering beans and rice every day. [just using it to illustrate a point, not saying Google is serving rice and beans only]. The goal of Google is to present how they have very high quality food during interview then start scaling down the quality (and cost) until employees will still feel like driving is a hassle but now a meal is $10 vs $30.<p>In the end however they lose with this strategy. The people working there can read between the lines. Google might end up with better end-of-quarter bottom line, but in the long long run they will be shooting themselves in the foot.",1327219631

3495995,comment,3494224,3495742,4,0,wisty,,,"> Yes, I just said economics is harder than physics.<p>I'm saying that too.<p>> You could not be more wrong. Economists, at least those from good programs, have great quantitative training.<p>Which programs? Is this Ivy League PhD, econometrics stream? Or undergrad? First year physics students learn special relativity. They won't learn the advanced stuff until 3rd year, or maybe 4th, but it's still taught.<p>But most economics students struggle with ""econometrics"", which is glorified linear algebra. There's theoreticians who <i>do</i> understand complexity, but none of their work is likely to be widely read. There'll be a few ivory tower academics doing really hard stuff, but it doesn't enter the general body of knowledge.<p>It's like saying that computer programmers don't understand algorithms. Of course some do, and there's research out there if you want to find it, but generally just they kind of know that O(n) is good, and O(2^n) is bad.<p>And while economists are pretty good at statistics (at least, the good ones are), very few use differential equations. It's not covered in undergraduate classes, and by postgrad classes it's too late.<p>And while IS-LM is going out of fashion, it's just being replaced with DSGE. I can't see any appendix on differential equations in the TOC of that textbook you mention, is that because everyone already understands them, or because despite the model being called ""Dynamic"", it's not? I quote Solow, the guy who kind of invented it:<p><a href=""http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/07/robert_solow_on_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/07/robert_solow_on_...</a><p>> I do not think that the currently popular DSGE models pass the smell test. They take it for granted that the whole economy can be thought about as if it were a single, consistent person or dynasty carrying out a rationally designed, long-term plan, occasionally disturbed by unexpected shocks, but adapting to them in a rational, consistent way. I do not think that this picture passes the smell test. The protagonists of this idea make a claim to respectability by asserting that it is founded on what we know about microeconomic behavior, but I think that this claim is generally phony. The advocates no doubt believe what they say, but they seem to have stopped sniffing or to have lost their sense of smell altogether.<p>Yes, economics is hard. Yes, there's smart people working on it. But by the time it filters down to teaching undergraduates or setting policy, the general attitude is ""we'll assume rational behavior and a market at equilibrium, so nothing we say is going to be too controversial"".<p>(trollish rant ahead)<p>I wonder what to ration of neo-classicals to quants is on Wall Street (where people actually have to make the right calls) compared to the Federal Reserve and the Treasury?<p>It's basic agency theory - the economists who <i>can't</i> handle complexity take over dumb institutions (like most universities and governments), then insulate themselves against having to learn anything they aren't comfortable with.",1327219473
