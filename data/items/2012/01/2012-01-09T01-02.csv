College GPA is a much better measure.</i><p>GPA is dependent on a lot of factors, including teacher bias, prior experience with instructional learning and similar things. Dropout rates are a much better measure.<p><i>If true, this suggests that there should be a gap between low level education results and standardized test scores (which are immune to racial bias, since the scantron doesn't know the race of the person filling in the bubbles).</i><p>It suggests no such thing. It would only suggest that if you believed every child taking a scantron test had received equal levels of prior education.<p>The fundamental flaw with your logic is that you believe incorrectly that everyone has equal opportunity at some point and you've decided to base all of your calculations off of this mythical point in time that everyone has equal opportunity and therefore any deviations from averages is a sign of actual inferiority in the capacity to take the average advantage of that equal opportunity. The reality is that no one ever has equal opportunity - from the moment of birth on. Black children are often born into a far more disadvantaged environment than white children. To overcome that disadvantage and succeed takes considerably greater amounts of effort, if not innate intelligence in some percentage of cases, to equal the success levels of those white children born to environment lacking that disadvantage. Everything prior to college admissions was not equal opportunity, everything prior to a scantron test was not equal opportunity. Equality of opportunity is not normalized after a scantron test, it is not normalized after college admissions and it does not normalize through college and post college.<p>Two people are sitting down. One has a 50 lb weight tied to his arms. Everything else being equal, which of those two will need to expend a greater amount of work effort to stand up? Does the fact that the individual with the weight took 25% longer to stand up mean he is less capable than the one with no weight? If they both took that same amount of time to stand up, which one would be more capable?<p>AA doesn't cut the weights off - nothing can do that. But it is a method of recognizing that those weights are there and accounting for them to some degree.",1326073884

3441180,comment,3439318,3440419,4,0,Tsagadai,,,"It's actually worse than that. Most students don't get part time work (most people I know here never worked before finishing their post-grad university). When you see someone young in a 7-11 they are probably stuck there. Education has such a huge social force behind it and every job is very competitive so you get people with masters degrees working sales jobs. For the folk who never did well enough to get into university they are often stuck in minimum wage jobs <i>for life</i>. No safety net means most people rely on their children to retire, if you were infertile or your children died you are probably going to be sorting garbage when you are 80 in -10C temperatures. I stopped to talk to this old woman on the street yesterday, she's one of millions in her situation.<p>South Korea takes capitalism pretty seriously. Competition is real here and failure is ultimate. Japan still has a fairly decent safety net with their pension schemes. South Korea, however, does not and relies on children to deliver for their parents. When children don't (because they are poor, they died, they abandon their parents) it all falls apart and the government doesn't step in (which provides a pretty strong incentive to succeed).",1326073828

SOPA has nothing to do with the Great Firewall.<p>Having spent a long time in China, I can see the dangers of the censorship enabled by SOPA.

I just can't see them taking that big of a step in protest of the SOPA.<p>They'd probably to announce it first, if it was a complete blackout; but if they didn't, someone going to the site would probably see just a blank page with information on the SOPA etc. Call me cynincal, but I'll bet 9 times out of 10 that the consequence would be the person either just clicking the Tweet/Like/+1 button (unless those sites have also blacked-out) and/or going to another site that provides the same service (""Google is down, so I'll use Bing"" ""Facebook is down, I'll use Twitter/Google+"") That's not all though; other apps, companies, etc. that rely on Google or whoever would also have to shutdown temporarily (except if the parent site kept the APIs open, but then what's the point?) Is that fair to those companies, to those coders? You might say it's a short term loss, long term gain, but other people might not see it that way; e.g. ""This site is down, so I'll use this other service until they are back up."" I'm not talking about why they shouldn't but why they <i>wouldn't if they don't</i>.<p>More importantly though, how will this change anything? I'm not saying people or companies shouldn't protest, but I think the only thing the company that blacks-out their site will get will be a lot of angry customers and investors. More people will be aware of the SOPA, and maybe mainstream media will at least mention it, but talk doesn't change unless action follows.

3441125,comment,3440596,3441106,6,0,apenwarr,,,"You are completely right for things that don't involve real-time video (like games do).<p>A 1/60 frame skip rate sounds like nothing important, but your eye will see it easily and it's instantly annoying.  It's not subtle at all, and not something you can write off.  Everyone will be annoyed by it and <i>then</i> your product will be doomed.<p>(Edit) I do however agree that the frame <i>rate</i> is not that important.  30 fps ought to be enough for anyone.  However, it has to be a <i>really really smooth</i> 30 fps; all the frames need to come out exactly 1/30 of a second apart.  Not realizing this is where a lot of people go wrong.  A smooth 30 fps looks much better than 120 fps to a human eye.  A game framerate that isn't an integer divisor of your monitor's refresh rate is also a disaster (since it means the display will be skipping frames).",1326071747

If you went to college and finished your degree, with fairly high likelihood you could get a job with a respectable salary.</i><p>That's still true or, at least, as true as it was 10 years ago (assuming you choose an employable major). The poster goes on to talk about the high unemployment rate -- with the implication that it's the fault of our universities -- but completely ignores the fact that today's high unemployment rates are largely driven by poor employment options for those who didn't go to college [1]. Berating our higher education system for a problem it has nothing to do with seems strange.<p>And then it turns out that the whole post is an excuse to plug the poster's startup.<p>[1] See for example <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm</a>.
