(1) At the beginning of your service, you will have to go to either basic training or officer training school.  For heaven's sake, be an officer: pay is better and life is better.  This school is several weeks long, and is full time.  (2) If there is a national or local emergency, you could be on the hook to be asked or ordered to serve.  In my experience, this occurs about once every 10 years.  Balancing these demands on your time, however, are: (a) When times are lean in the civilian world, you can usually find openings to get put on orders and get some income, (b) I have made fantastic lifelong friends in the Guard, which rarely happens in the civilian workplace, (c) a great pension plan if you stay in 20 years.

I ended up staying at MIT for all four years + an extra year for their 1 year EECS Masters program.  After graduating, I got into the YC summer batch.  While at school, I was working on a variety of different side projects.  I purposely picked relevant subjects like Machine Learning / User Interface Design / Behavioral Psychology that seemed to fit into the project.<p>Not only did it help me understand the subjects better, it let me master a number of direct cross-applications into web products. It does wonders for your creativity when you are actively thinking about new products while being exposed to so many new techniques.<p>.<p>On the topic of dropping out, an aspect that gets underemphasized is how strong of an ideation muscle you have.  The more you do it, the better ideas you come up with.   School for me was an excuse to building new things while hanging around taking a few classes.  As each year passed, I realized I got better and better ideas. Back then, the first few ""promising"" ideas that I came up seemed like game-changers that would transform the world. Now I realize if you are the kind of person who comes up with good ideas now, you'll come up with great ideas later on.<p>Use those years in college to train up your ideation muscle along with your implementation skills (web dev languages / backend management / mobile dev, etc.) During your final year, apply to incubators using your uber product development skillset and amaze everyone. Not only will you no longer have the temptation to return to school, you will be putting yourself up for review when you are strongest.",1327730904

There's still quite a bit of potential for interprocess resource-sharing.<p>If you somehow managed to get a statically linked Firefox (I think it would be very difficult, given the degree to which Drepper has abandoned the idea) on a modern Linux system, though, the resource usage would admittedly probably be quite impressive.",1327730644

If programming is indeed a skill, then why can't someone learn it at any age? My father, in his early 50s, is learning the skill of ""debugging"" his iPad when he needs to do something; instead of calling me, he's starting to use forums and search engines to find his answer. I would consider that a skill, yet he's learning it without having any computer experience at all.<p>What basic skills are the foundations for programming? Abstract thought? Deductive reasoning? Maybe someone is more inclined towards programming versus some other field, but I believe everyone has at any age the ability to learn how to program, much like everyone has the ability to learn a new spoken language at any age.",1327730624
