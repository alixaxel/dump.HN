My goal upon graduation was to hack the UNIX kernel. This was no easy feat in the early 90s, so I took a job as a sysadmin upon graduation. When I finally got a chance to kernel hack in 1995 I found I hated being in front of a monitor for 8-10 hours at a time. Even though I loved contributing to open source/Linux etc in my spare time.

Getting the sensor aligned with the lightbox (and the viewfinder) basically meant a different model for each of the various SLR cameras out there. The sensor itself was pretty low-rez and had little in the way of dynamic range. Oh, and since things were so inefficient at the time, you needed to butcher the camera (drilling a hole in the baseplate) to feed power to the canister-cum-senor (and, if I recall correctly, to get the data out).

Then, I remembered this parable about how knowledge comes from people, not places:<p>> ""At a gathering of divines, the Mullah was seated right at the end of the room, farthest from the place of honor. He began to tell jokes, and soon people were crowded around him, laughing and listening. Nobody was taking any notice of the greybeard who was giving a learned discourse. When he could no longer hear himself speak, the president of the assembly roared out: ‘You must be silent! Nobody may talk unless he sits where the Chief sits.""  ""I don’t know how you see it,"" said the Mullah, ""but it seems to me that where I sit is where the Chief sits.""<p>After recalling this parable, I realized that I had initially misunderstood the OP's insight.

3428190,comment,3422678,3422678,2,0,eolamey,,,"I would suggest that anyone interested in Configuration Management would read the article, event if they are pretty sure that their tool of choice is exactly right.<p>I have used puppet in the past an am now a happy chef user. I find that node attributes, data bags and search queries (from the nodes themselves) are very compelling reasons to use chef.<p>I agree that installing either chef or puppet on even a somewhat recent distro can be difficult, and this might be one of the reasons that CM is not as widespread as it should (I maintain PRM packages for chef, and it is no so easy...). So I agree with one of the points made by the author. But I have to admit I pretty much discarded his other ideas after reading the article at first, even though I poked around in the documentation.<p>But then, I thought about the points made and I must say that a CM tool made of small, autonomous, well tested ""parts"" makes a lot of sense. If you think about it, a CM system's job is to configure UNIX servers (mostly), so why not implement it the UNIX way? It is a bit like the Hubot implementation by Ted Dziuba: back to basics!<p>You CM tools, wether puppet of chef, must: deliver files to nodes and then execute code to ensure that they are in a proper state (it's a bit more complex than that, but not that much). I'm not sure if it's better to use push of pull for file delivery, but this should be an independent task, that could be implemented either way. Using SSH for security and access control seems like a no brainer. Then comes the compliancy part, where code is executed to ensure that the node is configured the way you want it. Why not have a bunch a small programs, which could be implemented in different programming languages, do it?<p>Let me give an example. Both puppet and chef work, at the lowest level, with resources. You define them in containers (manifests or recipes) and then make sure they are defined on the nodes. You could have ""file"", ""package, ""user"" or ""template"" resources (for example), like:<p><pre><code>  # this is pseudo chef code for a fictional redis recipe\n  package ""redis"" do version ""1.0"" end\n  user ""redis"" do uid 230 end\n  template ""/etc/redis.conf"" do\n    user ""root""; group ""root""\n    mode ""0644""\n    notifies :restart, ""service[redis]""\n  end\n</code></pre>\nWhy not have each resource definition as a UNIX programs, that can be executed independently? My understanding is that cdist uses shell functions, but I would prefer regular programs, which could be called from anywhere:<p><pre><code>  # in a shell script, distributed by the CM tool\n  package redis --version 1.0\n  user redis --uid 230\n  template /etc/redis.conf --user root --group root --mode 0644 --restart redis\n</code></pre>\n(I know this looks pretty much like what cdist does, but I'm trying to get to the point made by the author without being distracted by the puppet critique)<p>I am convinced you still need attributes, bits of data attached to roles and nodes, for your CM to be efficient, but I don't see any reason this could not be implemented in cdist.<p>Anyway, this comment is getting really long and I am not sure I made my point. I guess I'm more thinking out loud rather than commenting on the article :)<p>Do yourself a favor, read the article, put aside the implementation details and website design, and think about the underlying points.",1325759648
3428189,comment,3427560,3428079,13,0,abestor,,,"(Disclosure: I'm the developer of Boxer.)<p>Boxer does a whole lot more than wrap up games. If you have a Mac, just download Boxer and give it a spin: the difference between Boxer and DOSBox will be immediately apparent.<p>If you don't have a Mac or don't feel like trying it out, then here's an exhaustive answer I gave to a similar question in a previous thread about Boxer (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2363917"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2363917</a>):<p>-------<p>Boxer uses DOSBox as its emulation core, but it has a completely redesigned UI and workflow for installing and playing games.<p>Boxer bundles DOS games into gameboxes, a self-contained app-like package format that appears as a single file to OSX and can be launched by double-clicking. Each gamebox is a self-contained DOS ecosystem that contains the game and everything it needs to run: drive folders and images, configuration settings, documentation etc. They're path-independent, which means they can be stored wherever you like, moved around, backed up easily, and shared with friends: without needing to reconfigure anything inside the gamebox.<p>You can create gameboxes by drag-and-dropping game CDs, floppies, disc images or folders onto Boxer's game import window. Boxer guides you through the game's installer if needed, then packages the game up into a gamebox (and rips its CD to an image, if appropriate).<p>Boxer aims to make DOS games require zero configuration and zero knowledge of the emulator's esoteric inner workings. It automatically sets up drives appropriately; it also pre-configures hundreds of games that need custom emulation settings, with more automatic configurations added in each new version. If needed, you can tweak common emulation settings (like CPU speed, emulation optimizations and mouse behaviour) directly while you play, using Boxer's inspector window.<p>The inspector also lets you add and eject DOS drives by drag-and-drop, at any time while you're playing a game: this lets you easily hot-swap CDs and floppies for multi-disc games. To this end, Boxer also auto-mounts any CDs or floppies you insert while playing, and removes them from DOS once they're ejected.<p>You can resize and zoom Boxer's window while you play, and toggle between rendering styles (HQx etc.) on the fly. Boxer's renderer has much sharper graphics than DOSBox at large window sizes, and has dramatically better fullscreen support: you can access the menu, dock and inspector window in fullscreen by unlocking the mouse, and switch back and forth to other applications easily from fullscreen. This is handy for checking up a PDF game manual for instance: which Boxer scans gameboxes for, and displays automatically in the Help menu for easy access.<p>While you’re at the DOS prompt, the window displays a slide-out program launcher tray so you can run the game program with a single click; while you’re running a game installer, the tray displays installation tips instead to help you through common installer questions.<p>Boxer has plug-and-play joystick support, letting you add and remove joysticks at any time with zero configuration. Boxer automatically corrects axis and button layouts for a number of popular HID controllers that are otherwise broken to the point of unusability with regular DOSBox. It also integrates with Joypad (<a href=""http://getjoypad.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getjoypad.com</a>) so you can use your iPhone or iPod Touch as a controller if you so desire.<p>Boxer reimplements DOSBox's standard 2-axis, 4-axis, Thrustmaster and Flightstick Pro joystick modes, and adds a racing wheel emulation mode with axis behaviour designed for driving games (this mode uses tilt control in Joypad incidentally, which is a surprisingly cool way to play). Boxer's Flightstick Pro throttle emulation also has assists for gamepad thumbsticks and displays an on-screen throttle indicator. You can switch joystick modes on the fly while you're playing.<p>Boxer also has built-in Munt MT-32 emulation: you'll need to find the ROMs yourself, but adding them to Boxer is just drag-and-drop. Boxer automatically enables MT-32 emulation for over 400 games, so there's no need to manually switch between MIDI emulation modes. Boxer's MT-32 emulation even displays the MT-32's LCD messages in a spiffy bezel - something no other emulator does to my knowledge. Boxer can also detect if you have a real MT-32 plugged into your Mac, and if so will automatically pipe MT-32 music to it (though not General MIDI - it can tell the difference).<p>Apart from that, Boxer has the usual trappings of a Cocoa app: proper menus, sane keyboard shortcuts, integrated Apple Help and automatic application updates.<p>I think that about covers it.",1325759629

Copyright infringement is a market problem, and markets are a lot more effective in delivering solutions than Governments. Consequently, SOPA will utterly fail to prevent copyright infringement, resulting in even MORE draconian laws sometime in the future.<p>Specific to the problem of music and film is that these markets are highly regulated oligopolies that use their market power to engage in price fixing. Unlike efficient markets, in which there are a range of different prices, the music and film markets only have two prices: Idiotically expensive and free (illegal).<p>Personally, I would LOVE to pay $1 per episode to watch my favourite HBO series at a time, and in a place of my own choosing. Sadly I cannot. Hence, I either don't watch it at all, or I obtain it by 'other' means. Monopolies/oligopolies only offer one price, and they are free to gouge their customers as long as they can prevent any competition in the market.<p>In other words, SOPA is NOT about preventing piracy (because that is a hopeless cause, much like the war on drugs), but about protecting the music and film industries illegal, anti-competitive price fixing practices (by way of preventing any other production/distribution of that type of media). Illegal price fixing is a small price that all Governments will gladly pay, as music and film support the propaganda/mythology creation industry of Government.<p>The simplest solution to prevent piracy would be to open the music and film markets to competition, but that is exactly what the RIAA and MPAA are trying to prevent.",1325759377
