If you're going to stop international piracy, you need to encourage other countries to pass DMCA style laws, not anything more draconian like 3-strikes laws. The DMCA has allowed innovation in technology to happen while still providing a method for take-down that results in a judge seeing it if it is contested.<p>I understand they're trying to find middle ground, but there really is no middle ground to be had. I also contest the idea that it's actually harming jobs. During the economic downturn the media industries have been doing just fine, much better than the rest of the economy. Combating piracy with SOPA and PIPA style laws will not result in an increase in revenue and will almost certainly  result in a decrease.

3464172,comment,3463426,3464047,7,0,gbog,,,"I'm not sure. The OP raise the fact the SQL is modeled after set theory. I happen to have learnt set theory a very long time ago, and to use SQL as much as any web developper around. Then I read a book about foundations of SQL, and found out it can and should be seen as an implementation of the set theory.<p>And you know what? It was like a revelation to me. It is incredibly helpful. And, by the way, it make me laughing inside each time I query MySQL (because MySQL is sadly /not/ a correct implementation, while PostgreSQL is). The ""dots connecting"" between set theory and SQL made also much clearer to me the NULL ""mess"" and why it has to be like that.<p>So, on this part I'd push the same way as the author, and would go as far as saying that doing correctly a ""button X pushed -> notify API Y + persist the action to Z"" simple glue code thing /is/ requiring a mental activity that (probably) uses the same parts of your brain as any mathematics and the use them the same way.<p>However I don't get why the author seem to be ranting against Test Driven Development. In my experience it is unrelated to how you model you data and interactions, except TDD will do exactly as the author is advocating: it will force you to write stateless atomic functions, to make them testable.<p>NB: From all I have read about mathematics on HN, it seems to me possible that we are not talking about the same thing. Maybe you and many other refer to some ""sin a + sin b = cos sin ..."" memorization exercise, and some multiple choice questions one have to check as fast as possible in order to get some good enough ranking.<p>I am talking about a teacher spending around 20 hours a week during several years in front of young people, telling them step by step how the world can be described, analyzed, understood with their brain. It started with: first predicate, there is something, at least one thing. Let's take this thing in your hand, and nothing else: you have a set. In your other hand let's take nothing: you hold now another set, the empty one. Then you have two different things. And on this the teacher built the set theory. (I was educated in France, when math were still on their pedestal).",1326547110

When I post something controversial, I often feel insightful while drafting it, but my 'spider sense tingles' because I innately fear downvotes.  If it does, then I get upset because I feel that I made myself vulnerable by sharing something I should have kept quiet since it was not popular.  Since an account apparently becomes 'dead' after enough downvoting, this is roughly being punished, at least digitally.<p>The faulty logic really kicks in when I use the same expectation of group reaction to garner upvotes.  I feel satisfied when I get 10 or 15 upvotes, even though those posts are <i>very</i> often just aligned with what I suspect is popular opinion.  I feel great, but gloss over the reality that I didn't really add anything new.  It's like eating some chicken mcnuggets - I didn't really get anything out of it but it felt good.<p>There's a sort of protective stance people use in online posts, a deflection of anticipated peer reaction.  Comment armor.  ""I know I'll get downvoted for this"", ""I know I'll get a -1 flamebait"", ""karma be damned"" etc.  We see this posturing all the time on karma based websites.

Their worldview seems very limited in that they never push the status quo; they don't seem to look very far into the future and they can't seem to recognize what's possible with some hard work.  Maybe they are afraid to step outside of their comfort zone.  They would probably call themselves realists.  Coincidentally enough, through my personal experience, I've found that these types of people tend to be ""control freaks"".  (Sorry for lack of a better word.)  There's definitely some correlation between trying to control situations and only attempting what is a sure thing.<p>I've also been grouped with people who, like me, are constantly trying to do things differently for the better.  For every idea, they try to figure out how and why it <i>will</i> work, if it isn't immediately obvious; but if they don't also take time to determine whether or not it is the best solution, it could be detrimental in the long run.  This is where the qualities of each person within the group becomes important.  Not everyone can find the balance between dreams and reality; more often than not people lean towards one side so they need to be paired with someone on the other.<p>Too many realists in a group and you'll see little to no innovation.  Too many dreamers in a group and you may never see the project's completion.
