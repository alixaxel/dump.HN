Analysts are talking up the size of the market over the next few years, but it's still relatively small and very fragmented.<p>1. Do you think TVs really are the next big form factor?<p>2. What are the prospects for Smart TV apps?<p>3. TVs have two main features: a) they're big screens, and b) they're receivers for high-quality  video content. Add internet access, the ability to run arbitrary software and (in future) touchscreens and the possibilities of both increase. Lots of people are thinking about expanding on b), eg apps for viewers to socialize over TV programmes. What about a)? Will we see TV apps that make use of the form factor - eg, allowing multiple people to work or play together?",1326391176

3457273,comment,3457028,3457150,1,0,tstegart,,,"Here's how I see the problem and how I would solve it:<p>I think you're trying to make money from the wrong people. I think you need to make money from the local businesses.<p>See, the concierge isn't making any money off your app, at least not in a measurable way. The person using the app thinks the app is helpful, not the concierge. If a tourist tips the concierge, the concierge thinks its him doing a great job, not your app. The hotel isn't making money either, at least not in a measurable way, because the connection between someone having a great time at a restaurant and re-booking a room is very weak. The tourist may attribute the great time they had to:(pick one) the restaurant; the city; the occasion; the person with them; the concierge; and finally, maybe, the hotel. In fact, I'd wager the hotel gets little benefit, the concierge will get the tips.<p>So your software is really just a drag on a hotel's expenses. Something they don't need. You're barking up the wrong tree when you ask for money from them.<p>How would I solve this? Well, I would give it to free to the hotels. If it helps them save money and time with their staff, they'll use it. I would also involve the concierge immediately. In fact, I would give them <i>incentives</i> to use your software. You probably can't afford to pay them, but you can afford to put in a tip reminder. In fact, maybe the hotel staff puts in the date of the traveler's stay and at the end, it automatically send them a text message asking them to tip the staff. You'd get waaaayyy more traction doing this with staff. In fact, I'd wager staff would love you if you really worked on this feature. It would be instant traction.<p>Edit: I would also work out ways to approach staff without needing the involvement of hotel management. Maybe the staff can add their names to the app and the customer can pick them out a list (and hopefully tip them). Staff could then use a website to do everything they need. Staff would do this without consulting management or getting permission, or might only need permission from their front desk manager. I would cut out upper management entirely if you can see a way to do it. Let local management and staff see all the benefits.<p>I'd then go out and sell ad space to the businesses. Or get a commission on each booking coming from you app.  Local businesses are the ones who will pay to get a hold of tourists walking around. I'd go after restaurants, tour guides, trip operators, fishing guides, you name it. They can offer coupons, all sorts of things through your app.<p>I know this is a major expansion of time and resources to put this into action, but I don't see asking hotels for money as a viable revenue source. If you did get traction, someone will eventually come along and offer it for free using the method I outline above and take over your market.<p>I would suggest concentrating on all the hotels and local businesses in one city first rather than worldwide or country wide. Get it working and get revenue coming in. Then go from there..",1326391030

Unfortunately, you can't just edit the source in place, unless your team is absolutely in love with your SCS' rollback capability.  So that means that in order to edit the code, you need to open it up in either another project, or open it outside the IDE's solution environment.<p>It also removes the ability to do partial rebuilds, since every file will be necessarily touched by the preprocessing script before compiling, so it's a ""new"" file as far as the IDE is concerned.<p>Debugging becomes a chore, because the code in source control is not the code that was compiled, breaking line counts and breakpoints.<p>Finally, it's a deployment nightmare for your build staff, since they need to make sure that everyone is standardized on the same perl version, maintain the scripts in addition to the makefiles, and make sure that everyone's dev environment works with it.",1326390722

If A and B get 3x faster, but C gets 3x slower, then your overall workload gets slower, even though the ""median performance improvement"" is 3x.  Obviously the effect is magnified with only 3 data points, but the number of points used in the examples on that page is not so much greater as to eliminate this effect.<p>Adding to this is that significant slowdowns, the ""outliers"" that you're keen to disregard, tend to dwarf performance improvements that the median might show (because of the multiplicative nature of these values: if A/fortran is 10x faster than A/C, and B/fortran is 10x slower than B/C, then A+B/fortran is 5x slower than A+B/C).<p>What's <i>really</i> right is to show the complete distribution of speedups and slowdowns (as one of the detail pages on that site does).  If you look at the actual distribution for the comparison of C and Fortran in question, C actually comes out looking much better than Fortran does (which shows precisely how misleading using the median can be).<p>If you must to boil it down to a single number, there are several choices better than the median.

The resulting database systems are large, complex programs which degrade total system performance, especially when they are run in a multi-user environment. UNIX provides hundreds of programs that can be piped together to easily perform almost any function imaginable. Nothing comes close to providing the functions that come standard with UNIX. Programs and philosophies carried over from other systems put walls between the user and UNIX, and the power of UNIX is thrown away. The shell, extended with a few relational operators, is the fourth generation language most appropriate to the UNIX environment. 1.

If the response is generally positive, the contract gets signed. We're still trying to schedule that demo.<p>We had a similar experience that went all the way to regional management for approval, but was denied on the false belief that we duplicated functionality of in-lobby kiosks.

We're hoping to use this to be able to reach a wider, non-geographically-constrained audience more quickly.<p>QUESTIONS:<p>1.

It's one of the best resources out there for getting numbers on the relative performance of languages, despite the pitfalls. The implementations of popular languages are well tuned (sometimes extremely so), the used compilers and settings are quite sane, and the benchmark programs are fairly well distributed in functionality.<p>The median is a reasonable choice because it's less sensitive to outliers and was probably chosen for that reason. ""Spectacularly poor metric"" seems to be an opinion, not a fact.<p>I admit it would have been better to compare Intel C with Intel Fortran. Why wasn't this done? Perhaps some of the submitted programs don't compile correctly with Intel C, or perhaps Intel C doesn't actually perform well on them. Who knows.<p>But to say that this is a ""terribly done study"" because of that is doing it injustice.",1326387809
