As the article points out it can encourage the use of vague buzzwords tip-toeing around the actual workings of the company and leaving people still without a clue as to what the company actually does.<p>And sometimes a business simply can't be summarised to such a short length, after all you want the listener to gain a quick, yet good understanding of what your start-up does. Keeping it short could lead to leaving out critical information though.<p>That said, I'll certainly work on single sentence descriptions for my projects, it can only be a credit to your business if you can have the listener instantly know what you do in a matter of seconds.",1325383112

When many organizations could flatten their management hierarchy and create more administrative roles. HR is a good example of a business function that can be done via administration and not authority.

As usual, this all depends on the team.<p>I'm part of a small company and we generally work remotely with occasional meet-ups. This is, of course, just my anecdote, but I feel that we're building a great company culture. Part of this may be the fact that most of us have been using IRC for 10+ years; we grew up on it. Communicating that way is as natural to us as face-to-face. In fact, we often talk on IRC even if we're in the same building. It's easier to paste links, reference documentation, and avoid constant interruption.

The problem I have with Java is that the programmer must use OOP in all sorts of situations in which it isn't really the right thing to do to make up for deficiencies in the language.  Particularly, the language does not have first-class functions or closures, and the boilerplate necessary to fake these features is so big that I would seriously consider solving a problem in a worse way.<p>The danger is that a person may think that the way things must be done in Java is actually a worthwhile way of doing things in general.  Such a person would be in a state of permanent confusion in which the meaning of the question ""How will I solve the problem?"" has become ""How will I partition the behaviors and data involved in a solution to the problem?""

They name it a new ""standard"", and at the same time they have things like ""\x11"" -> Timestamp, a special internal MongoDB data for replication.

All subsequent readers are blocked until writer quits, which can't quit before greedy reader does. This is a nightmare. That was before 2.0, now the greedy reader will yield, writer will finish, and all the pending readers will be unblocked. This is only an improvement if you consider the nightmarish previous situation. There are still two problems: 1) single writer blocks all readers on a shard while in progress 2) as soon as a new writer is queued up behind the reader lock, all subsequent readers are queued up again.<p>Does this look like optimal resource use to you? It does not to me.<p>Let's contrast this with ""legacy"" engines:<p>Sybase: readers/writer lock has granularity of a 8kb page. If you're not touching the same page someone else is writing you're fine. (*) they might have moved on since the 1990-s, I haven't looked.<p>Microsoft: reader/writer lock has granularity of a row. If you're not reading a row someone is writing, you're fine. That was in the 1990s, they have since moved on to snapshots, but have not yet made them default option, I think.<p>PostgreSQL or Oracle: 1) readers are reading a snapshot and never block writers 2) writers block each other, and granularity of locking is single row. If you're not writing the same row someone else is writing you're fine.<p>SQL Lite - readers do not block writers, there is a database-wide writer/writer lock. Note that this is a very lightweight desktop-oriented database, not a cloud solution.<p>MongoDB - reader/writer lock granularity is a shard, the part of the database apportioned to a single CPU core. If you happen to read data on the same shard someone is writing, or is planning to write you're not fine at all. Their plans are ""collection level locking"".<p>So I get it, you're saying they planned to add serious concurrency later. I agree on that - they planned. Where you and I disagree is that they will likely fail, because retrofitting concurrency is exceptionally hard. I just can't believe that anyone who knows what he's getting into would actually agree to get into this.<p>I understand you need to compromise something when you start out, but I think concurrency is the worst possible choice.",1325381209

They also use crazy ""new"" things like interrupts, notifications and wait queues. This article actually explains how mongodb does <i>not</i> wait for IO, but handles other requests in the meantime. (within the current known limitations of writer/writer locks, etc. of course - i'm not saying it's all perfect)<p>Did you really read the post before arguing this?",1325380372

The Object/Relational impedance mismatch stays right there where you leave it.<p>Using K/V stores will only help you write data. But the whole impedance nightmare is right there, waiting for you to try and make some sense of the data. Especially if you want to do relations.<p>And you are dead wrong about relational DB's. It is either due to habit or because of being a better fit that users demand representations of data that are best served from a relational source. So you better plan your data models wisely, because you WILL pump this data into a relational source, sooner or later. It would be wise do keep a schema around all the time.<p>In the end it is merely a question of data normalization and the use case at hand.",1325380177

Now we're getting somwhere.<p>But what about load balancing and CDN's?<p>DNS was not designed for those purposes.<p>What if users are not completely ignorant of the geographical locations of the IP addresses they choose to store and use, and if we allow them to make their own choices?<p>Determining which is the closest server or the most responsive is not rocket science.<p>A good HOSTS file coupled with a good local cache is in my experience faster than any DNS service.  But it's relatively rare to see users setting themselves up this way.  My guess is that is not due to difficulty, it's due to ignorance.  Maybe even peer pressure.<p>The ""experts"" will tell you to use a shared cache, exposing you to all manner of security flaws.<p>Ask yourself how many lookups the average user makes in a day to the DNS?<p>How many of those lookups are for the same sites, day after day?<p>How many times do the IP addresses for these sites actually change?<p>Finally, ask yourself how many of those lookups are for IP addresses not attached to any website you will ever visit (i.e., they are for serving advertisements, behavioural tracking elements, etc).<p>You can also restrict queries only to authoritative servers. 
This is something I threw together as an exeriment.  For me, it works beautifully.<p>Then the ""experts"" will tell you we need DNSSEC, to counter the problem posed by using shared caches.<p>The impetus for its resurgence is the use of shared caches and ""cache poisoning"".  Do we have to use shared caches?  No.<p>DNSSEC has become like security theater - the simple fact is that no one is accountable for the information in the current DNS except the site owners themselves.<p>All the DNSSEC proponents can do is pray that more people will start using it.  It's a cash cow for some consultants.<p>The other simple fact is that the most important TLD servers do not change IP addresses very often.  They are more or less static.<p>Anyone can download a copy of those numbers and store it.<p>Does it matter if each individual record is signed?  It only matters if you like to do recursion.  Maybe what matters more is that the file you download is itself signed.<p>For the DNSSEC system to work, to restore some confidence in shared caches (which may potentially be censored by SOPA-like legislation), the most important people who need to use DNSSEC are the authoritative servers for the websites themselves.<p>Will they undertake this?  Weighed against the triviality and increased security to the user of using a local cache and HOSTS file, thereby avoiding cache poisoning altogether, is anyone going to bother with learning DNSSEC?<p>DNSSEC is a huge burden.  Unless of course you offload responsibility to someone else.  Cha ching.  But no one is going to be more secure using something they delegate to someone else and cannot themselves understand.<p>To someone who wants to learn, I can explain a HOSTS file and how to do non-recursive lookups much easier than I can explain DNSSEC.<p>We have wider acceptance of EDNS.  And there are people advocating TCP.  Obviously some people really want DNSSEC to take off.  Why?<p>If the Internet can handle the load of EDNS and TCP, all for a simple number lookup that otherwise fits in 512 bytes and requires no connection setup/breakdown, querying authoritative servers instead of doing the inherently insecure recursion routine with other people's caches is not going to bring the Internet to its knees.<p>algoshift, you are absolutely correct.  Decentralisation is the way to go and, imo, is in the true spirit of the Internet.",1325379642
