3463412,comment,3463064,3463292,7,0,vannevar,,,"Your argument is an echo of a similar one made during the debates over the Bill of Rights. While there was general agreement that the government should be limited to enumerated powers, there was a lot of debate over whether there should also be enumerated rights. Those in favor argued that the enumerated powers would tend to expand and intrude on core liberties unless those fundamental rights were also made explicit. Those against generally argued that including the rights would send the wrong message, and that we would eventually be limited to <i>only</i> those rights. The latter argument lost and here we are.<p>So what about IP? Well, as you say, we ought to recognize fundamental rights even if they aren't in the Constitution. But it's fairly clear that the founders didn't find copyrights or patents to be fundamental, since they failed to include them in the Bill of Rights but instead explicitly included them in the enumeration of powers. And the term 'intellectual property' wasn't coined until long after the Constitution was written. Copyrights and patents weren't a separate form of property in the law, they were monopolies granted by the state in order to promote manufacturing and distribution, which were at that time very capital intensive.<p>Regarding your example:<p><i>[T]o say that you don't' have a right to it, would be to say that others have the right to forcibly take it from you, wouldn't it?</i><p>No, as you noted earlier the Constitution concerns what the government can do to you. It is silent as to what your fellow citizens can do. The 'forcible' part of your hypothetical is already covered by other parts of the Bill of Rights (the Fourth, for instance). So I'd rephrase your statement of the question:<p>""To say that you don't have an exclusive right to the invention would be to say that the government could copy it and make use of it without your permission, wouldn't it?""<p>That's closer to the issue we're debating. And in fact, the Government has exactly that power today. But that doesn't settle the issue, because it has the same power over real property. And in both cases, the owner does receive compensation. Why compensate someone for something they're not in some way entitled to?<p>History is not going to give us the answer as to whether IP is a right. It's going be decided as a matter of modern politics, not historical precedent.",1326513006

It wasn't too long ago that I myself wasn't using version control and decided to learn Git. Someone who's just learning isn't likely to pay for a service like that until they get some experience and understand how to really use it.

You really shouldn't be bragging if you really feel something isn't quite ready. But then again I come back to my point about criticism. There's constructive criticism and there's overly harsh criticism. You're right,mthere should definitely be more talk and less action but we all know how we are. I've seen it a million times. A really cool project comes along and there's always those smartest-programmers-in-the-room types that have to tear it apart like its garbage instead of offering up some constructive suggestions or actually taking action.

3463397,comment,3463064,3463292,8,0,aamar,,,"As a community of thoughtful 21st-century people, I suggest we reject entirely the idea of ""natural rights"" and treat it as an archaism.<p>Natural <i>laws</i> exist; regardless of anything you, I, or the government does, gravity continues to exist as a physical, observable force. Natural rights do not work the same way; they are inherently and in principle unobservable both directly and indirectly. The only thing that is real are the rights that we have in practice (e.g. as a function of law, economics, culture) and the rights that we ought to have, based on testable theories of how these rights lead to human flourishing.<p>I say this not to demean rights or to say rights or liberty are unimportant. (Similarly, if I say evolution rather than direct divine intervention created humans, that does not demean humans.)<p>The reason I make this claim is because ""natural rights"" is a complex concept that many people struggle to understand. But most of that struggle comes from it being an unsustainable idea as well as a dead end: it discourages serious consideration of how we should best organize our society. Religiously-inspired philosophers (John Locke, in this case) spent much time on ideas like this; certainly some people inspired by these ideas did some good things. But I think in our modern era we should set these ideas and other bad philosophy aside and work from better foundations.<p>Not only will this lead to stronger, more useful thinking generally, but it will also lead to more secular, persuasive dialogue with our legislators in the short term. They are bound in various ways by the Constitution, but they are not bound by the theory of natural or inalienable rights, which is not actually part of that document (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarationism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarationism</a>).<p>edited for clarity.",1326512140

I'm not talking about design patterns here, but abstractions that hold explanatory power in your problem space. They necessarily increase code comprehension, reduce potential bugs, etc.<p>Abstractions reduce potential bugs by reducing the 'interaction-space' of a particular entity in your code. Think about a program that has 100 variables all in one function. That is potentially 100! interactions between entities in your code. When you make a change, you have to reason about all 100! interactions to be sure you're not introducing a new bug.<p>Abstracts greatly reduce this space. If instead you have 10 objects who each contain 10 variables, within the object you have 10! interactions to reason about. In the main function that ties each object together you now have 10! interactions to reason about. This is many many orders of magnitude easier than the original problem.<p>The more (natural) abstractions, the better your code.",1326511937

It is believed that the decrease in volume coincided with the emergence of cooperative, prosocial behavior, which enabled the members of reduced-cranium groups to solve some problems that eluded their more amply-brained relatives. The larger brains were adapted to more independent modes of survival.\nBonobos have smaller brains than chimpanzees, but can solve problems that larger-brained chimpanzees will not solve, unless they decide to cooperate, which is unusual. [There are videos online of cooperating chimpanzees in the lab.] Successive generations of domesticated animals exhibit reduced brain volume in comparison with their ancestors.<p>The assumption that assimilation into the group is always good ignores the flip side of cooperation among prosocials. Prosocial behavior doesnt imply feeble-minded docility. Fear of separation from the group, and antagonism toward larger-brained independent individuals is deeply ingrained. The reduced brain volume is compensated for somewhat by vindictiveness. Prosocials reward conformists and will punish transgressors at some cost to themselves. Road rage is an example. The capacity for revenge, even if this is costly, is the flip side of cooperation.<p>Groups are good at solving some kinds of problems, but not all problems (cf.

A more communal individual would be prone to throw their hands up and call for a meeting. (I hate when people try to make their problems be everyone's problems.) But, they're cheating themselves out of a wonderful experience. Going at it alone in the face of uncertainty is a delicious thrill; you start hacking away at it, hoping for something to give, but ultimately knowing you're just making it up as you go, and it may not work out. Eventually, you learn enough about the problem such that you can talk about it semi-coherently. But until then, talk is useless, no, it is an impediment. Without understanding, there is no use attempting to articulate anything. Intuition begets understanding.<p>I believe some companies simply cannot accept this level of uncertainty. It's too dangerous to take something on that might fail. They can hire all the cogs they want.",1326510474

Without that precious rating you lose potential buyer.\n2.- These countries live on debts. Bad rating => higher costs => taxes increases or spending cuts (which is an easy programm these days in Europe ;) ). Note: France is not the US, investors have not the same trust into them.\n3.- GDP, jobless rate, export balance, etc: French are out and German are in which will have hugh impacts on the solidarity fund, political credibility, etc. (And remember French are still sensitive about having a Germany not dominating the Europe.)<p>The worst part is that Germany has kept its AAA. This means that the downgrade does not punish a ""European problem"" but a ""Country problem"", and this will have hugh impacts during this election year and for solving the issues in European.",1326510398

The fact parents are not even allowed to bring along their children while they play is an obvious sign that exposure to these machines do children harm whether they actively play or simply watch.<p>It seems to me it makes common sense for Apple to create an adult section in the App Store that requires a secondary password to access. That would at least prevent some children (who's parents don't monitor what they do) from accessing this type of material. There is little you can do and there are bigger issues at play for the children of parents who are allowed to access adult content after such features are in place but it would assist in protecting the majority IMO.<p>Of course, common sense approaches rarely work because people on the fringe of either side will either want gambling apps banned for adults as well or think it's the sole responsibility of the parents and therefore no changes should be made.<p>I don't know anyone that would classify slots as a ""card game"" and ""suitable for ages 12 and up"" so why is it acceptable for Apple to do this? The fact you can't win money doesn't change anything; players rarely have an edge in real casino games anyway. It's fucking worse than children playing slots in a real casino as far as I'm concerned.<p>Why does it always fall to those who stand to make no financial benefit either way to call for these changes to be made while Apple/Playtika/Caesars can take a fuck it approach until they are forced to change by which time large profits have been made and the damage done.",1326510020
