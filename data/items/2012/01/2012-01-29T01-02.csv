My bad.<p>My moral intuition with regard to copyright probably isn't entirely consistent. For instance, if a poor kid wants to learn but the parents can't afford books, is it OK for him to pirate those  books (either with a photocopier or digitally)? I think it is okay, and it's definitely in the best interest of society. After that it's just a slippery slope towards a very free interpretation of ""fair use"", regarding music, art and so on.<p>As for D, society punishes people harshly mostly for being unstrategic. After all, they should just do a ""We fked up!"" post regardless of their beliefs, because it's obviously the <i>strategic</i> thing to do. They didn't do that right away, so they are effectively punished for their poor strategy, not for their moral judgement. Even a transparently disingenuous apology is (erroneously) judged (by the public) as an apology of sorts, even though it only means that the company in question did a cost-benefit analysis.<p>Effectively we're browbeating companies into giving the sort of apology we want to see, regardless of what they believe they did was wrong. That's sort of messed up, when you think about it.",1327802243

Slightly more tricky is separating the top 1% that are really good from that top 10% who can develop and design at all. Distinguishing these two levels of competency is easily and accurately accomplished by an interviewer who is a competent developer himself. And yes, it is much better to pay the top rate for the small number of developers that are competent and efficient rather than pay a few percent less than that for people who can contribute little to a project, which is unfortunately the case for most of the talent pool.",1327801775

It really comes down to treating blogging like a business and scheduling time to write:<p>* 2-4 hours a week need to be booked for this marketing activity.<p>* Use the pomodoro technique during those hours to help keep you focused and more productive.<p>* Give your blog a clear focus and ""reason for being"", whether it's a niche blog (e.g., CoffeScript Inside) or a more general one (e.g., stfu's adventures in web development). Answer the question ""why should readers care?"".<p>* Keep a list of headlines you intend to write about in the future in an ideas.txt file or Google Docs.<p>* Get your blog popular (and perhaps profitable). Part of the reason why I focus so much on getting bloggers to attract traffic (and then benefit from it) in my book, is because when you start seeing traffic spikes and perhaps even getting some extra benefits (money, freebies, etc), you'll get addicted to that feeling and you'll be more inclined to keep up with blogging.",1327801097

In one case, the visitors browser automatically fetches the image.  In the other, the visitors browser fetches it at the users request.<p>Don't misunderstand me, I'm not defending the action. But no, it's not stealing.  Defining it as such is just as wrong as defining copyright infringement as stealing.",1327799024

We don't know if anything bad is going to happen, but we should be prepared for the possibility.<p>People like the WSJ op-ed writer might as well be telling people not to save for retirement or carry insurance. You might die young, so why waste money on a 401k. You might never get in a car accident, or get sick, or have your house be flooded. So why waste money on insurance?",1327798831
