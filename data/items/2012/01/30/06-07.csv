3527788,comment,3526571,3527125,1,0,jsz0,,,"In my experience that's pretty much the exact opposite of how   enterprise IT works. That's why we tend to end up with so much miserable hardware/software. It's usually a calculation of cost/technical adequacy/ease-of-support. User preference or usability in general is not a big concern. Many companies have only recently begun to replace BlackBerries on a large scale. If you were correct we would have seen huge adoption of the iPhone 3G in the enterprise 4 years ago or maybe the iPhone 3GS 3 years ago. It's a trend that has really picked up only in the last 2 years or so on a large scale.<p>We have an IT company that is outsourced to handle all this stuff for us and they only deploy iPhones. They recommend replacing BB/Android devices via forklift upgrade. They actively do not support Android. If you're using anything other than BB/iPhone you're on your own. This is just one company out of probably thousands that provide similar services so maybe it's not a common policy. It was pretty sobering to me though. It reminds me of the Mac in the enterprise in years past. If you somehow managed to sneak one in the backdoor you wouldn't actually be allowed to use it. If this is becoming a common policy for Android devices then Google has a huge uphill battle. These types of companies aren't going to be re-evaluating their policies very often.",1327906757

What a load of horseshit, especially since Google OWNS Motorola now (something people seem to constantly forget, including Google employees). He has no excuse, this is just a completely ridiculous and unfair comparison.<p>I might as well just say that Google is evil because they pay very little tax, and Apple is awesome because they give Americans good development jobs. Both facts are true about both company, but why let a little thing like reality stop you from ignoring that to serve your point?<p>The consumer electronics manufacturing and assembly business is ugly. No one company is better or worse unless they actually demonstrate that. Apple at the very least offers their reports. Where are the reports from all the assemblers that also use Foxconn, including ones involved in some high profile suicide related cases like Microsoft?<p>Oh right, Apple is the big boys so let's throw rocks at them. I get why the guy in the TAL segment focused on Apple. We can all agree they are an attention grabber and delving into ""Well, Microsoft does it too"" is totally missing the point in that instance.<p>However, if Googlers are going to start casting stones like they are sinless because they just deal in data and collecting data is A-OK, I'm afraid I'm going to have to point out what a load of crap that is.",1327906752

It doesn't support sending the file object (which presumably would be processed according to RFC1867) on Firefox, but it does support that on Chrome.<p>As a result, for cross-browser compatibility you have to upload via raw POST data and send your own file metadata headers. Not entirely a bad thing, but it's annoying because most HTTP servers don't support this. And because you cannot send the file object, you have to load the file into browser memory. No streaming options.<p>Thus, you have to make multiple request uploads that upload a chunk at a time to the server per request (spliced uploading), which is annoying and unnecessary.<p>To make matters worse, Chrome doesn't support XMLHttpRequest.sendAsBinary (WHY? you can easily implement this in javascript anyway), and a bunch of other random inconsistencies.<p>And no, PUT doesn't help.",1327906650

This is not a slam or being patronizing; I'm looking to add a data point.<p>I'm in my 50s and I haven't subscribed to a newspaper in 10 years. Most of the young people I know, in their 20s do <i>not</i> read physical newspapers and many of them don't watch broadcast television.  Newspapers are fast dying out, and TV stations are starting to sweat. (I've worked in and out of broadcast TV for the last 15 years or so.) Demographics are defiantly skewing to older people, and even those are dropping.<p>They don't print photos at home <i>or</i> at photoshops.  They look at them on their computers or phones. These days the only time I ever print a photo is for my 96 year old father; he has vision problems looking at screens. Until recently he was perfectly happy to look at photos on his desktop PC. In fact a major project I did for him was to scan in boxes and boxes of old photos. (Many of which I've recently had to print out again into books.)<p>Now I do know lots of people, guys mostly, who have wood shops or car repair tools.  I'm not really talking about technical people.  Mostly guys in their 20s - 50s. And when I go to the hobby stores these days I see all sorts of interesting ""making"" stuff aimed at women. One company makes a CNC paper cutting machine that is very popular with scrap bookers.  They have recently expanded into a machine that creates elaborate cake decorating layer. And some of the polymer clay craft systems are very suggestive.<p>People have always been makers, that's part of what defines people.

First, it provides an air of legitimacy for the claim that purchasing a copy doesn't automatically provide all the ""license"" you need to do whatever you want with it.  It ought to suffice to purchase as many copies as you simultaneously stream; streaming should not require a magic ""streaming license"", especially not one that costs more than just buying a copy.  And second, the concept of any kind of compulsory transfer of rights for a legislatively fixed amount of money seems fundamentally opposed to the concept of a market, and accepting that in the realm of copyright seems like a dangerous precedent.",1327903316

Why might you choose an iFrame over XHR for communicating with the server?<p>2.) What are some ways that you can get JavaScript onto a third-party website that can then communicate with your server and display some data on their website?<p>3.) Can you write a DOM traversal without using JQuery or other third-party libraries?  Why would you want to?<p>4.) Which DOM API calls are slow and what alternatives do you have for them?<p>5.) Say that you have too many CSS rules for IE and need to come up with a quick fix that doesn't involve refactoring your CSS into something more sane or reducing the number of CSS rules.  How might you do this?<p>6.) Which tags are self-closing in HTML5?  Which tags may be omitted entirely?  You can look them up, but which site would you go to?<p>7.) How do you make an AJAX app back-button aware in different browsers, and how will HTML5 help this?<p>8.) How might you track that a user has clicked on a link, and again, how might HTML5 help this?<p>9.) Do you know about Canvas, localStorage/sessionStorage, the <video> tag, WebGL, and various other HTML5 goodies?<p>10.) How do you write custom attributes on HTML tags in HTML5?<p>All of these come directly from actual problems we've faced at Google, BTW.  If you know 'em, great - I'd pick up one of Python or Ruby and learn how the server works (and we're hiring, BTW).  If you don't, I'd go deeper before going broader.<p>All of the questions, BTW, boil down to one meta-question: do you think about the <i>whole</i> user experience (including latency, stability, integration with third-party sites, and other UX conveniences), or only about putting pixels on the page?<p>(Edit: Also, Patrick's advice is great.  My advice is mostly training you how to make yourself more valuable as an employee.  His is training you how to make yourself more valuable as an entrepreneur.  The two skillsets are not mutually exclusive - hell, I became an employee because I needed to learn some skills so I could become a better entrepreneur - but they optimize for different paths.)",1327903226
