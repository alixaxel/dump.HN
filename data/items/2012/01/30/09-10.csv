3528097,comment,3526621,3527687,2,0,mayanksinghal,,,"You should calm down, the furiousness with which you  defending Apple would only lead to people assuming that you are not taking their points seriously.<p>Now, Yelp case is where Google acted selfish. There is a thin line between a commercial entity being evil (not kill-people evil but steal-your-ideas-or-money-or-data evil) and it being selfish. Google definitely acted selfish, just like any other corporation should and does. The line that separates selfishness and evil is unfortunately subjective (and often biased) which means that while you see something as clearly evil, others find it just selfish - I am pretty sure that no one here is going to deem these actions selfless; we are not that naive.<p>Now, to your points here and at other places:<p>(1) Google made in Open Source Operating System. It is by definition (with some exceptions to how it was enforced), open source. If there was no Android, there would have probably been no competition to Apple and hence no leverage against them.<p>(2) Android is not a necessary software; which means that if arbitrary restrictions like ""Only to be used on labour-friendly devices"" are put, there is no way a third party OEM is going to sign it; there are replacements available and we have already seen (with R. Stallman) that overly offensive campaigns do not go well with majority.<p>(3) Google is not charging anything directly for the OS. This means that they cannot put forward conditions to manufacturers like ""I will charge you $10 less, if the $10 goes to the labourers""; Apple should. Whether or not if that is a possibility for Apple is a different story altogether (one that I cannot comment about, I have no experience in Chinese Political system or in device manufacturing).<p>(4) I am from sort-of a third world country. Our evil is way different from your evil - labour exploitation and fierce competition practices that we see, are way worse. While you are focusing on First world problems (e.g. order of information when a place is searched on Google, which BTW is not affected directly - the changes were on Google Places) only these companies are fairly global in their user base and development sites. There is a rating of evil that hence we have to consider; some actions that they are involved in on some continents would be way worse than others that they do on the North American and European continents. Evil - Good is definitely not a binary object.",1327917526

Whilst looking for revenue as soon as possible certainly makes sense I think you can get momentum to sustain you through the highs/lows in other ways. Certainly looking at usage metrics can help convince you you're moving in the right direction. But most important to me has been trying to move things forward every day. There are days where that's not possible, but the default evening activity is to do even just 30 mins or and hour on my project. Even if things seem a struggle, there's usually something interesting to work on which will make at least a small improvement.<p>To counter the obvious criticism here, I am aware that this could lead to maintaining optimism working on something which will never generate revenues. You still need to have a plan to generate cash and to test your assumptions about how that will work.",1327917495

In my experience, I feel much more productive working alone rather than in groups. It allows me to work at my own pace. In working alone, I can keep my assumptions in my head, and have a full understanding of what my tasks are and what needs to be done to be completed. I feel my preference for this work style comes off as closed off, but having worked in different environments I know this way yields the best results for me. Working too often in groups gives a false sense of unanimity, where differing approaches are suppressed. I've also seen decisions be dragged on much longer than it really should take.",1327917037

Her first point (moral panic has stopped LGBT youths from seeking advice from strangers in the LGBT community, especially online) is probably true. The second (""It Gets Better"" could have an unintended affect) is tricky. The third (media harassment is bad) is obvious, and the forth (adults should also blame themselves and society) is kind of broad and meaningless.<p>You're taking umbrage at the second point - that ""It Gets Better"" can make things worse. Just because it's a well intentioned (and in some ways effective) movement, does that mean that no-one can question it without bullet-proof evidence? Well intentioned movements often make things worse (in some way), and you can't rely on ""real"" research to uncover this if nobody is asking questions.<p>I'm all for supporting ""It Gets Better"" until it's proven to be a bad idea, and supporting whatever it morphs into if a better idea is found. I also think that questions should be asked; even stupid ones. Creating an ""us and them"" mindset is the fastest path to groupthink.",1327915406
