3436229,comment,3436076,3436076,4,0,jonnathanson,,,"<i>""Imagine Twitter without public follower/following counts...""</i><p>I suspect it wouldn't work -- due in some part to vanity, and in a large part to the well established social-psychological phenomenon of ""social proof."" As a species, we like things that are popular. Conversely, we are hesitant to sample things, let alone subscribe to them, until they've been validated by others. Ideally, we seek things that have been validated by others of high social status. But in a pinch, validation by a large number of people will do the trick.<p>We keep social score. And, even if we don't consciously realize or even accept it, we want others to know our own score.<p>I tend to agree with most of your points, though. As you very eloquently put it, our natural tendency is to accumulate noise -- even if we claim to want signal clarity. Google+'s circles are a great attempt to let us have our cake (noise) and eat it, too (signal). But over time, I imagine that the act of constant social curation and message-filtering will grow more tiresome than it's worth for many users. That's just a hunch, and it's totally unsubstantiated by any data I have, or could ever hope to get my hands on. At least for now.",1325912080

The branding aspect comes from seeing an entire trading floor with the branded monitor/keyboard. It is recognizable anywhere you go. The keyboard has special keys which are used by software features for which the user base has acquired muscle memory (they do help you become a faster user). Also things such as embedded speakers in the keyboard so that terminal A/V can be played  anywhere because customers computers might not (it is common) have speakers.<p>Also, wrt to being a web app, there are users and then there are users. Sure, certain customers' usage might be fine for the web (and it can be run remote from anywhere on the web for the obvious reduced performance due to remoting), but receiving 50k+ ticks a second and pumping screen updates to 8 monitors in a trading situation is not something a browser is good at.",1325911802

I've meditated for some years now and one of the main things he had me pay attention to were the smooth transitions between poses and quality of breath in particular.  He seemed to agree with an observation I made about it being much like breath meditation with movement added in.  Keeping a steady and concentrated mind with careful movements that flow together with the breath were important to maintain and he only gave me a handful of simple poses to work with, things like just raising and lowering legs and turning my legs to the side.  No fancy poses or anything.  He talked about the ignorance of many yoga instructors too and how dangerous it can be if not taken slowly and with great care.",1325911217

I've only been out of college a few years (so YMMV if you're more experienced), but for me Hacker School was one of the two or three most important adventures I've had. (And, like most good things, I believe the benefits are ongoing.)<p>I first met the Hackruiters in June when I got in touch looking for a job. I had moved to NYC two years before to work at a non-profit and was ready for a new challenge. My best friend and I had spent the better part of a year moonlighting on side projects we dreamed might become startups, and--even though they went nowhere--I had realized I wanted to get back into programming.<p>Dave set up a Skype date and I told him about my background: I'd been a math/science kid who spent his teens coding, but ended up studying art history and architecture (because of varied interests) in school. I had done some technical internships, though, and was curious if I could rebrand myself. What kind of work could I do to make myself a better coder and ultimately become a developer? Dave had some initial suggestions and we agreed to talk again after a while.<p>I'll never forget sitting in the most boring staff meeting of my life and opening up Gmail to find a short (but warm!) e-mail from Dave asking if I'd like to join a school for hackers. There were to be no teachers, no assignments, and the dates and location were still totally in flux. It sounded perfect. Within the week, I arranged to take a leave of absence from my job. New York is not cheap, but I'd spent two years packing my lunch and avoiding taxis in the hopes that I would be ready when a cool, slightly risky opportunity came along.<p>I've spent a lot of time talking about my own background for two reasons. First, I hope you can empathize with me and--in doing so--will consider applying. I think there are many people with non-CS backgrounds who would benefit from and be a benefit to Hacker School. The other reason, however, is that Hacker School is exactly what you expect: if you can imagine a month (or three) working on projects that interest you with some of the brightest folks in the most exciting city in the U.S., then you've pictured it precisely.<p>Many alums will talk about the employment benefits of Hacker School; indeed, I honed my coding skills and talked to 6 NYC-based startups, eventually short-circuiting interviews after falling in love with one where I now work. For me, however, Hacker School was about finding a home with the kindest, most egoless group of smart folks I've met--a group that Dave, Sonali, and Nick are especially skilled at assembling. If this sounds like your thing, you should give it a shot--and I'll buy you a beer/coffee some Saturday when we (students and alums alike) head out in the evening to talk code and socialize.",1325910045

3436183,comment,3436172,3436172,3,0,nostrademons,,,"In my experience, the bottleneck skillset for the tech industry (and probably many others) is <i>initiative</i>: the ability to take an actual user need and then figure out what needs to happen for that user need to be met, then go make it happen.  This doesn't have to be a manager: you put together a group of 3-4 engineers with strong initiative and a worthwhile goal, and it'll happen regardless of whether they have an official manager.<p>Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to teach this.  The best thing a manager can do is get out of the way and see who steps up to the plate, possibly giving some helpful hints if people seem stuck.  It's very easy to <i>kill</i> initiative, though, and most conventional approaches to management do exactly that.  Heck, for most people the public school system is 13 years of training in how not to anything other than what you're explicitly told to do.",1325909869

We encourage students to work on projects and not ""products"" and certainly not startups. We especially encourage code that's written for other programmers to use (e.g., frameworks, libraries, command line utilities). We also focus purely on code and there's nothing at Hacker School about ""scheduling or managing expectations"" (that confusion might have come from our use of the word ""shipping""? We use that to mean ""getting code out and to a publishable state"" because so many people -- ourselves included -- have a tendency do the first 90% of a project and then not put in the last bit of effort to put it on Github where others might benefit from it).<p><i>A hacker de-assembles, re-assembles, engineers, and reverse engineers systems, on their own time, at their own pace, and is not motivated by profits and deliverables as much as the mere process.</i><p>There are no profits or deliverables (at least in the traditional sense of the term) at Hacker School. We just build stuff we love and that we think will help us grow as programmers. For instance, last batch a Hacker Schooler and I wrote an Apple II emulator in JavaScript (<a href=""https://github.com/nicholasbs/appletoo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/nicholasbs/appletoo</a>), simply because we'd never done it before.

The second just ended a few weeks ago, so it's too early to report from that one, but for the first: We had six students. Four decided to look for jobs after Hacker School. Of those, one went to Photoshelter, two went to Venmo, and one went to Tumblr (another has since started working part-time at Venmo). We keep in close touch with all of them (they're friends now) and all are quite happy. (We obviously have little data so far, but my hunch is that was an abnormally high percent of a batch to be interested in a new job right after Hacker School; I expect it to lower in the future.)<p><i>I guess one way of answering that question might be knowing a little about how participants did with their project portfolios in finding new gigs that you guys did not act as referral agents for . . . ?</i><p>The guys who ended up at Venmo happened organically, so the portfolios worked well, I guess :)<p>We stress building code and putting it on Github because we think it's  a really good way to improve, but it also has the benefit of building up a portfolio which helps a lot when it comes to getting a job. There are so many stupid proxies in hiring, and having good code online cuts through a lot of the bullshit like a knife through butter.<p><i>Regardless, this is a very cool take on the ""building better hackers"" stories going on and I hope you guys are wildly successful.</i><p>Thanks!",1325908842
