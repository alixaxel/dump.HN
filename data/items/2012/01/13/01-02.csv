From what I've read, the fact that Microsoft keeps doing it just means they won't learn their lesson, and Apple et al. doing it just means they're more evil than Microsoft in this respect.

Instead the concept of government granted monopolies begun during the reign of Queen Elizabeth 1 with the East India Company came first. It wasn't until later that the concept of government granted monopolies was applied to intellectual goods. However, when the concept of government granted monopolies were applied to intellectual goods it was done so with the intention of maximizing the benefit of society by providing <i>only</i> enough incentive to encourage innovation not profits. Intellectual properties rights today have become completely divorced from their original intention of maximizing the commons due to the selfish pursuits of individuals and companies that have distorted the laws. Most of these distortions of the law weren't even introduced by those actually doing the inventing, but by heirs and assigns trying to establish and safeguard a constant source of revenue. That constant source of revenue has permitted many people to sit on their laurels instead of innovating.<p>Intellectual Property rights have been completely distorted from their original intent of encouraging innovation and maximizing benefit for society.

This is worse than ""donate to a politician, hope they vote your way"" -- this is ""pay Wikipedia money if and only if it performs a specific action on a specific date and time."" That goes so far against why I love Wikipedia, and why it performs such a unique service. Small, tight teams, no strings attached donations, unfettered public input. Those are things worth preserving and fighting for, but not at the cost of those things themselves.<p>I would hope Wikipedia returns the money or donates it to some other worthy cause in the event of a blackout.

3458752,comment,3457946,3458039,5,0,greggman,,,"WRONG! :-)<p>The way you suggest is why Android's back is confusing. If I hand you my phone and put you on a particular screen and ask you ""if you press back right now where will you end up"" you have no idea<p>Even if it's your own phone if it's been a few minutes, hours since you last used an app you'll have no idea.<p>Heres what I hope is an objective fact about the Android back button. ITS NOT PREDICTABLE!<p>The way it works is that each app has a stack of screens. Pressing the back button pops the current screen off that stack revealing the screen below. If there are none you are taken to the home screen. The problem is lets say you start the Messaging app. The first screen is list of conversations screen. You pick a conversation and now you are on the conversation screen. From the conversation screen you press back and you get the list screen. Press back again you get the home screen.<p>Now lets take another senario. You are in the browser. You get a notification that you have a new message. You select the notification for the message. You are taken to the conversation screen. You press home and do something else, say listen to music. Later you decide you want to send a message to someone. You go the home screen and pick the messaging app. Since the app is still running you see the conversation screen. You press back you get the home screen. WTF!<p>In the first case it went conversation->list in the second case it went conversation->home<p>Notice in this case, even if you had an amazing memory and could remember that you happened to launch the messaging app from a notification an hour ago or last night or something you still have no direct way to get to the list screen. The only way there is to select the messaging app either from the home screen or the recently used list. Youll get the conversation screen. You press back and youll exit the messaging app back to the home screen. Now you have to navigate the home screen to the screen that has the messaging app icon on it so you can re-launch the messaging app and have it start in on the list screen.<p>Android should never have had a back button in the first place. If there was no back button there'd be no way to make it inconsistent. Switching back to another app would be come the simple habit of holding home for a moment and picking the app you want to go back to and you'd always be able to predict where any button will take you.<p>I applaud them for trying to fix it but putting in the guidelines, which may or may not be read by the majority of devs, seems unlikely to fix the problem.",1326418161

Batteries might address this, but their rate of improvement is slow (no Moore's law there). The apparent solution is ""multi-core"", but we aren't able to parallelize in general, after decades of research. Note that desktops are stuck at quad-core - there's more cores on server chips, but they are usually doing many tasks already (e.g. webserving). The dramatic multi-core progress is in GPUs, which again is a naturally parallel domain.<p>You <i>could</i> switch to power-hungry performance when docked, like the Transformer Prime... but it seems a bit of an ugly chimera in general.\nIf performance is needed for development, then x86 desktops will win.\nEventually, ARM could catch up to what is needed (even if x86 keeps ahead) - but if this is to simultaneously satisfy mobile needs, it will be at a <i>much</i> slower pace than Moore's Law.<p>An ARM <i>purely</i> for desktop could catch up easily; but what benefit does it offer over x86, if its power-consumption advantage is irrelevant? And it lacks the massive ecosystem of x86 software. But that's not the idea discussed here, of a dockable mobile device.<p>Other factors: (1) ARM SoC is cheaper and smaller than x86; but Intel has made a SoC x86. (2) people like the convenience of the same data, apps and UI for mobile and desktop; but cloud provides the same data; webapps address the same apps and UI.\nA prediction: the iPad 3 won't be quad-core. It's too hard to convert multi-core into user performance, so it's an efficient use of power and silicon. Instead it will have masses of GPU silicon (at least x4 the iPad 2, for the x4 pixels in the retina display - possibly x8, to give an sense of improvement in addition).<p>tl;dr battery life and multi-core prevent an ARM-based dockable desktop.",1326417060
