There's quite limited resources online.<p>Sun was an exciting company with its own vertical technology stack, and I was always surprised that they never made a serious attempt at making Solaris the developer workstation of choice. To do this they would have needed to (1) maintain a first class web browser environment; (2) provide a less sucky window manager; (3) multi-monitor support; (4) something that handled PDFs nicely; (5) an adequate non-console email client. Something like Java but with a better GUI layer would have been nice too. They bought the Lighthouse guys but then didn't use them.<p>Solaris had a significant technology advantage over NeXT, an established base in enterprise (a lucrative marketplace and much more forgiving than home desktop).<p>Ironically, while Sun were busy burning their OpenStep stack, NeXT were embracing Java and that kind of saved NeXT. It allowed independent NeXT developers to ride forward on a maintained technology stack (WO/Java) while Apple retooled.<p>Would be interested to know anything at all about OSF, and what distinguished it from SVR5.",1326113976

The C kind of arrays get passed to and from functions using naked pointers and that makes lots of compiler optimizations more difficult because of aliasing issues while a Fortran compiler knows that two arrays cannot alias (use overlapping memory areas). By adding a ""restricted"" declaration to your pointer types in function signatures, the compiler assumes no aliasing occurs and goes on with the optimizations. It's the coders' responsibility to make sure no aliasing happens, but if it does, all hell can break loose.",1326113394

C/C++ will not parallelize your code by design. It's was never meant to. I'd never blame my stick-shift car for not changing gears by itself - thats the first reason I didnt buy an automatic in the first place!<p>If your matrix manupuilation code performance becomes an issue, you, the C/C++ coder will have to parallelize it <i>and take responsibility for whatever assumptions have to be made</i>.<p>Im sure that the limit of what one considers as acceptable code alteration by the compiler/interpreter depends on the person. Personally I'd be very wary of a system trying to guess-parallelize my code - especially if I can do it myself whenever I see fit by adding a dozen boilerplate code lines. I'm sure most academics needing a numerical calculus system would be glad to have the system abstract away every possible optimization, so that they can stay as much as possible in the 'abstract math space'.<p>I am also kind of wary of the ""look, I wrote the program in several languages and here is the perf comparison"". Our skills with each language vary. What I liked was (i cant seem to find the link) a teacher who asked his class to write a program doing some text manipulation/indexing (iirc) in whatever language they wanted.
The fastest code was in C, yet the worst C implementation was <i>significantly</i> slower than an average java code. To sum all this up - the speed depends on the skill of the person in the particular language, much more than on the language itself.",1326113102

Better might be a winner, but the article does not say that.<p>It matters in that it's something that people can't complain about. If it had a non-unique UI, then it would be dismissed almost immediately.<p>""Originality Means Fewer Forays Into The Patent Wars"" - Why? Just about everything is already patented (""An object oriented interface to the operating system"" by Apple), so I don't think this is a valid claim.<p>They got this wrong; in actual fact the reason they don't need to worry about patents as much with WP7 is because they have the patents from windows mobile to attack pretty much anyone who tries to sue them.<p>""Uniformity Across All Devices and Carriers"" - Apple has that too. Also, the non-uniformity is one of the selling points of android.<p>It's also one of the major annoyances of android, as we've seen updates go completely ignored by OEM's and carriers. From a developer point of view it's also a more challenging experience due to fragmentation.<p>""Zune Is Baked Right Into the Operating System"" - Remember Zune? No? It was the next iPod killer. By the way, the iPod is baked into iOS.<p>Not every music service/player is born equal, and far too many people gloss over its excellence. Zune has the Zune pass, which is unique to it and allows it to have a far richer music discovery experience, which is unrivalled in the marketplace. Speaking of which, also has as much content as iTunes these days (same # of songs etc.)<p>""Xbox Live Gaming Support"" - IMHO this is the only valid point. Still it's not a unique point, with play station integration into Sony's androids...
This is actually one of the lesser interesting parts of WP7, as there aren't many multi-player games.<p>Someone else mentioned press releases - this article is far too error-prone to have come from Microsoft.

I studied computer engineering at UW, and it was more intense than anything I've had before or after university. I definitely would have burned out by third year without my coop terms.<p>It also helped that coop paid for everything: tuition, rent, food, etc. (Although, I don't smoke/drink/do drugs/drive/have expensive tastes...) I graduated with a net (albeit tiny) profit instead of the massive debt most students seem to end up with. An 18-month placement probably would have been financially equivalent, but I would have had to take on debt before my third(?) year to benefit. Judging from my friends in other programs, having money troubles or taking on jobs while in school is extremely stressful.<p>(Aside: One could argue that since I admit to struggling to get through without frequent rest that I am under-prepared for work, but having been in a full-time position for some time now, I can see that university was artificially intense. Nobody in ""real life"" expects the same rate of output. Although, now I feel somewhat under-challenged because I had just managed to get used to the amount of effort required to do well by the time I graduated!)",1326111721
