It brings all of the expectations of corporate america to the position that I don't think belong there. As much as I think companies are one of the best ways to innovate and compete in the world I don't think government should be run like a company.<p>CTO is a top down position where you get to call the shots. This government position is just doesn't have that kind of power (nor should it) and I think the name should reflect that.

The owner swore like a sailor about an ex-staff member who'd come back with the keys he'd ""lost"", and stolen from him in full view of the security cameras.<p>You need to know our audience, and to have chosen the personality you're prepared to project as your businesses spokesperson, but DHH (and Ben) have clearly both chosen to be perceived as ""guys who'll use strong language when people steal from them"". That choice might not ""work"" if you're in the clergy, or a school principal, but making that choice as a caf owner or software company spokesperson falls a long way short of ""not acceptable"", at least in my book.<p>It's always impossible to measure the _really_ interesting stuff, but I wonder if 37Signals earned more benefit from people thinking things like ""DHH is _really_ passionate about his business."" than they lost from people who though ""he used curse words on Twitter, I don't want to do business with him anymore""?

Sorry for the lack of formality.<p><i>defer</i> is a function which returns another function.

    callback(some_result)

And here, by calling <i>callback</i>, which is the <i>function returned by defer</i>, it will end the await block.<p>Here's a trivial example:<p><pre><code>  await
    some_function = (fn) -> fn(1234)

    some_function(defer(x))

3524348,comment,3523024,3524087,2,0,bandushrew,,,"yep, what if you do? copying a color code is certainly not speaking to copyright concerns.<p>There are a couple of points to consider though.  the first and most obvious is that generally a background color by itself will not work well with the other colors on your site - choosing items in isolation like that is generally a fantastic way to end up with coder art (believe me, I know something about how to produce coder art).<p>The thing that good designers do, and do well, is make all the elements work together, generally if you simply take a single element (background color, font sizes, etc) from someone else's site and dump it on your own site without considering the overall effect, you are doing a stupid thing.<p>I don't think anyone here is worried about the sharing of ideas - uses of color, general placement of elements and so forth, taking those things and merging them with your own needs and messages is how new art is made.
The problem with copyright usually comes when someone simply does wholesale copying without the process of considering each element in terms of its effect, the message you want to get across and so forth.<p>IMO A 'good faith' copying of highrise done competently would produce something new, something where the source of inspiration can be clear, but where there is sufficient change and obvious consideration of the factors that made your own product unique that there is no question of direct copying.<p>The damage done by straight copying is always twofold, the first is the obvious - the breach of copyright, the second is also clear but many people miss it - a design produced that speaks to a specific product, specific website goals and specific messages is very unlikely to have the same positive effect if transplanted wholesale.<p>That is why wholesale copying is not just a sign of a lack of ethics, it is also a clear indication of a total lack of competence.  The person doing the copying entirely lacks knowledge of the process that is required to produce good work, and has no idea why the site they admire so much works so well.
Even putting copyright and ethical concerns aside, I would have no interest in working with someone who lacks the competence to understand why wholesale copying is usually a stupid idea.  They will not produce good work targeted at my needs, they will produce good work targeted at something entirely unrelated.",1327808367

If the evidence of AGW actually was overwhelming then it'd be easy enough to present it and move on, as happened with the ozone hole. Instead the evidence is rather more subtle and has very significant error bars.

I remember your post about your YC experiences, and it was great, especially since I was considering doing something like this and really identified with it.  I think I probably would have quit my job anyways, but getting into an accelerator like TechStars really made it a no-brainer.<p>I'd like to raise the point that the idea you apply with doesn't matter a ton.  It should be good enough to show that you're not stupid, but that's about it.  We've already changed what we're working on significantly based on early customer development and discussions with the amazing TechStars mentors.  It's actually been a little hard to convince myself that the reason we got accepted was like 90% team and only 10% idea (totally made up numbers, of course, but you get the drift).<p>I completely bought into the concept of an accelerator validating your idea, and that was really just kind of wrong (at least in our case).<p>Anyways, thanks again for the comment.
