As if anybody takes them seriously.<p>PvdA have sold out our rights every time they where in power. The SP has already shown itself in favor of internet censorship on several occasions (yes, even when it came to supporting the copyright mafia, that's the ""socialist"" party for you).<p>Pirate Bay will be blocked, and nothing else will happen. The only hope is not having a corrupted judge on the appeal, because the media will drop the story after tomorrow, and so will the politicians. And we'll be stuck with yet a bit less freedom on top of everything they've taken away over the past few decades.<p>Net neutrality was the only real win, <i>ever</i>, in the past 20 years. The rest has all been a downhill slope.<p>We are the country that wiretaps its citizens on the largest scale of any western nation. We have implemented a public transport system that allows us to trace people's comings and goings. The media has swept most of that under the rug, just like it has swept ACTA under the rug.<p>And it's not just digital civil rights that is a low priority in the Netherlands, it's civil rights in general. Look at how we are now an ID-card carrying nation without much protest.",1328011120

I had my netbook in the kitchen with the recipe up on it, and something immediately struck me.<p>It's an Acer Aspire One with a small widescreen 1024x600 display, and the mouse touchpad is a bit temperamental. Now, the recipe was on an ad-supported site, and the recipe itself was in a narrow column in the centre of the page with the recipe sections (title, description, ingredient list, directions) stacked vertically on top of each other. The menu was on the left, and the banner ads were on the right.<p>The entire recipe was pretty small and would easily have fit easily on one screen, but because of the boilerplate and ads, I repeatedly had to scroll up and down to switch between the ingredients and direction. Again, because scrolling is a bit awkward on the Acer touchpad, I was particularly conscious of it.<p>I found myself thinking: I should develop my own online collection of recipes and display them with the ingredients on the left and the directions on the right.",1328010652

If anything, what I'm using it for these days is to follow someone interesting (like a developer on a project I like, or, since I'm also into Olympic lifting, those types of people) and see if they tweet anything.<p>So, I lurk and follow. Rarely do I engage anymore. And they are never conversations since 1. twitter absolutely SUCKS as a communication platform (can't see what people reply to a person, can't see what people say about a subject...no way to aggregate the information etc) and 2. twitter still, to this day, drops tweets.<p>#2 fathoms me. As an experiment I followed the exact same people from two different twitter accounts. Using twitter.com for both, I had remarkably different streams. This is just awful.<p>Even so it seems that most of Twitter is marketing these days. Spam upon spam upon spam followers and replies. And most everyone is selling something and tweeting about it. It gets very, very tiring.<p>Twitter isn't really interesting to me anymore. Not sure if it will be in the future, but I don't see myself using it much in the near term.",1328010588

You'd get a toothache, a few days later you'd be dead. There's a reason why in all those old westerns people submitted to having their teeth pulled out with pliers without any anesthesia. It was a hundred times better to lose a tooth than die. You get a toothache -- even out on the prairie where the only ""doctor"" is your friend Gus who dropped out of second grade, and Gus is going to be yanking out your teeth. It was just common sense.<p>As a side note, this will probably sound amazing to many readers, but working both for myself and my startup my family went for over a decade without health insurance. Didn't seem like that big of a deal.<p>Of course we had one rule: if you're really sick, you go to the doctor, no questions asked. In the states they had to see you, and you generally got great service driving up somewhere, even if you didn't have money. The trick was finding out where to go. Over those years, we ran up medical debt at times, yes, but nowhere near the amount we would have paid in health insurance premiums. (Which really shouldn't be a surprise. Basic math, there. We were in a low-risk group.) We had several kids, dental operations, gall bladders removed, vaccinations, ENT surgery -- all kinds of things. And everybody got all the medical attention they needed.<p>It was simply risk management. Yes, things could have turned out differently and we could have ended up hundreds of thousands in debt. But the numbers were on our side. We made the decision just like the insurance companies do -- based on demographic risk. And if you're not making much money you can really only owe so much anyway. After 20 thousand or so, it might as well be 20 million -- you're never going to be able to pay it back. And if you owed 20 million, you'd still be alive and kicking and able to do all the things you love. That beats the alternative. Our downside was limited by the practicalities of medical debt collection.<p>It was a good decision, and I'd make it again.<p>Sorry for the digression. The point in telling the story was that even if you don't have insurance, working in a startup, slaving over the product 80 hours a week, fresh on a team, meeting with VCs -- none of that matters. All those other stresses in your life are silly by comparison. Learn to recognize when you're really sick and then immediately get help.",1328009409

No external application required either. That is the power of Emacs and that is a power not available to Sublime Text (unless you write your own C++ parser in Python).<p>You see, clang is an awesome tool and I'm sure its integration in Sublime Text is very good. But by its design it can not look for headers in appropriate locations without someone explicitly telling it to do so. Also it can not parse partially erroneous code. Both these actions are just not sensible actions for a compiler.<p>And that is why no external tool can ever provide the integration and practicability of a tool purposely built just for parsing code for Emacs in the same way cscope can not match the integration of Visual Studio's C# parser in Visual Studio.",1328008692

Life expectancy, probably a good measure of the efficacy of a health care system, is very close, perhaps with the UK having a small lead, if anything[2].<p>If we were to allow anecdotes, I'd also say (and I find this to be a good thing) that people in the UK don't avoid going to the dentist or doctor because it's too expensive.  I'm sure that there must be studies that show this to be true.<p>Even if we're not allowing the anecdotal argument, however, if you're prepared to say that the system in the USA 'does work', you're surely prepared to say that the British system also works?  Personally, I have a hard time not believing that, since it seems to produce comparable, if not better outcomes, for less cost, it's the better of the two systems.<p>Note that I'm /not/ arguing at all that a private health insurance system could not be devised that also worked as well - perhaps better.
