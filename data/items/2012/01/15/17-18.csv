It's important to realize that if <1% of a group is in the 1% there is a fair chance that they are not the ones bringing in the wealth. Instead they have married into wealth. The darkness of the squares is much more informative then the size of the squares.<p>In some ways I feel the graphic is misleading since I'm not horribly interested in what groups happen into the 1%, and much more interested in what groups create the 1%.",1326650384

But it is possible to make large amounts of money without being paid by the people using your service, if there is a ridiculously large amount of those people. Google is the best example, that part is true.<p>To be more concrete, there are at least two possible ways for something like Dropbox to make money without users paying Dropbox directly:<p>* Data mine the files hosted for users. Even anonymized data like this can be very valuable for third parties. Edit: or for other separate services inside your own company.<p>* Ads that become an integral part of the Dropbox service, preferably targeted using data mining from the previous point.<p>Are these good ideas?

Digging it up, here it is:<p>""Why I like Learn C the Hard Way:<p>- Opinionated. I think opinionated textbooks are great because they limit their scope and focus on something. Rather than being an authoritative reference (who uses text references anymore?), it's a framework for learning.<p>- Emphasizes reading and <i>editing</i> which contributes to overall understanding<p>- It's lean. Goes with opinionated, but it's nice that it doesn't repeat what's been done, but sends you there directly, i.e. don't waste time writing about ""strcmp"", send me to ""man 3 strcmp"" since I need to get familiar with it anyway.""<p>Disclaimer: I'm a bit new to low-level coding, so feel free to point out why these reasons for liking the text might be naiive.",1326650110

I've never contacted Congress as I presume my input will have no meaningful impact.  I think what you're working on with PopVox could change this reality by organizing citizen input & communication.<p>Another idea I've had is to implement something like the White House petitions for Congress with the response threshold scaled to the size of the congressional district/state.  So you might need 500 votes to get a formal written response on an issue in Rhode Island, but 1,500 votes to get a formal response in California.<p>Another idea is to have a system to have voters elect citizen spokespersons on each issue (users vote up good commenters).  If an issue becomes popular the Congress member would engage in a live video discussion with this citizen spokesperson(s).  This would have a bigger audience than most townhall meeting where only a few hundred people at most can fit into a room.  Instead, thousands of people would be able to watch these online discussions.<p>Your team's doing some great work.  I hope to hear more in the coming weeks/months!",1326649143

It was that she came out as a really smart, intelligent,sweet, eloquent and mature person in every interview she gave after hitting the headlines for being invited by Bill Gates. I wish some of these interviews had subtitles so you could have a better understanding of what I mean. For example when asked(at the age of nine years)what her really outstanding achievement was, she replied that it was her ability to gift a computer lab to a girls school of her native village(after winning awards and grants etc). When asked what she wanted to do next, she said she would like to start ""digicon"" valley in Pakistan like silicon valley in US. And may more like that.<p>Secondly, she didn't belong to elite class at all. Her father is a retired Army officer, which means essentially middle class.

Utilitarianism is a great model for a democratic society to use when encoding things into legislation, but isn't a great ""be all"" for ethical theory or ontology.<p>Your test and request are problematic.  If there is a creative work that might have been produced but wasn't, for the reason you'd like me to somehow cite evidence for, by what search method (other than knowledge of my own personal creative endeavors) should I seek out such an example?  And if I pluck from my own experience, what would constitute evidence that the actual reasons for non-production are what I claim them to be?<p>I would bet there are thousands of bedroom-class electronic music producers who never devote a ton of effort to their talents because of the rate at which music is pirated.  The number of hours it takes to become passable at production is quite large, even with great tools.  And even if they become accomplished, they have no great hope of turning that accomplishment into gigs or recordings that pay a living wage, precisely because piracy became so rampant that people now expect new artists to give away their first EP-worth for free or under a ""pay what you want"" scheme.<p>The world has decided that the fruit of those first 1000-4000 hours shouldn't cost anything.  You're telling me that doesn't have a chilling effect on people deciding whether or not to spend that kind of time?<p>""But see,"" I imagine you saying, ""Now we only get artists who were willing to do Whatever It Takes to become great!""

I should have said that the reason they asked for my wife's info is because they wanted phone bills and those are in my wife's name which isn't the same last name as mine.  That said, I'll still stand by my statement that the risk and complexity vs. reward was just not suitable for me.<p>EDIT 2:  Okay, they offer an alternative for validation: they can mail you a registered letter with a validation code on it.  That is much more acceptable to me, so I'll continue on with the process to see how that goes.",1326647655
