The aim of a museum isn't to have a (boring) collection of items restored to brand spanking new condition.  It is to record the story associated with each object, and that story can be lost by restoration.  A particular bit of damage might be significant as a record of the events at the time, for example, marks on a building due to a record flood, a bullet hole due to a particular battle or a significant piece of graffiti.  It gets complicated when one has to choose which story to tell, such as a painting with two layers.
