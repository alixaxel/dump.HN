I also spent considerable time volunteering with one of the presidential campaign's IT departments.<p>By the time I left high school I didn't (as far as I know) have any required testing.  I took the SATs/ACTs/SAT IIs the same as any other student.<p>Wherever possible I applied using a college's home school form, and I wrote supplemental essays wherever possible explaining why I left my high school (especially important since I had awful grades at the time I left).

So yes for us living in Canada, USA, Western Europe...etc there would be absolutely wrong with living forever and rewarding ourselves for all our marvellous work with exotic travels until we're bored and then we can just take the ""death"" pill at a time of our own choosing.<p>In your retirement travels to distant lands, however, it is very likely that you would encounter people who do not view life in those terms. You might discover that they work simply to survive, and perhaps have some kids for whom they try to make life just marginally better. And maybe in 50-60 generations, the ancestors of those hard-working people would be able to enjoy themselves a little more and spend their 60s travelling the world just to see what other places look like.

Making such a drug in the corporate funded environment of our biotech industry would certainly result in an extreme imbalance of the availability of the drug. So in a world where the balance of food supply, resources, income and power of influence is already impossibly and unfairly askew, it is very likely that the existence of the anti-death drug would be the final nail in the coffin of many impoverished populations.

What you don't mention in the case that all startups refuse a buyout is that the #1 search product improves at a much slower rate.  Their technology may be interesting and useful, but in itself not enough to draw consumers, while if it were integrated into a larger product, it could bring that new technology to many more people much more quickly.
