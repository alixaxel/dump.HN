Agreed, as a web developer you have to compete with worldwide competition, that may be ""unfair"". Yes, you have to find a business plan, that still works.

The guy next door opens one, and their menu is as good as yours, but costs 1/2 of your prices. You can't match them, because of all the dirty tactics. You have two options. Go out of business, or start using those dirty tactics too, and then you become a part of the problem.<p>You can tell me there are other options, like, I don't know, turning my restaurant to something completely different, but the principle still stands.

By acclimating people to expect copious benefits without having to pay for or otherwise earn them?<p>As for who manufactured the scam, you hit the nail on the head. There are those who are in power and wish to remain so, and the best way to do it is through bribery by theft, aka welfare/""social responsibility"". It's not a conspiracy to hurt themselves (laws are for others, not them), but to gain control over others.  It's just like giving wild animals food; soon they lose the desire and incentive to hunt/forage for themselves, and you've gained control over them.<p>Before you accuse me of ""gross generalizations"", you should know I was born into a dirt poor family. But we had pride, morals and a strong work ethic, and my parents were proud to have never taken welfare.  We knew the welfare people and wanted nothing to do with them.  Many had kids just so they could collect more welfare per child and proceeded to spend it on alcohol, cigarettes, gambling.  Essentially whatever the parent(s) wanted, the kids be damned with most of them turning out bad--prison, murdered, or a second generation on welfare. The theme has continued throughout my adult life, only it's now extending into the middle class as well.<p>Finally, if you think my ""gross generalizations"" from personal experience and observations are repulsive, I know people who have a much harder stance on this topic than I do.  They're a friend of mine and her colleagues--who are social workers in a major US city. She (and perhaps the others) got into the field to help others get back on their feet--only to find not apathy but hostility towards any attempt to get them off ""social responsibility"" programs, sometimes to the point where she's felt her life in danger.<p>A better overall society indeed.",1325985343

If the 'tedious clicking' is mitigated by a plugin, then the pressure to pay real cash is decreased, costing the app developers revenue<p>So, this plugin reduces facebook's ad revenue, reduces app developer's revenue and if the application uses facebook credits as currency, facebook loses its cut of lost developer revenue as well.

That PDF document does not show how other chess programs do the same feature, so it's very hard to tell if that's a natural way to implement the same approach or if it's a copyright violation.<p>My knowledge of this is based solely on the chessbase article. It shows one method of fingerprinting chess programs which suggsts that Rybka 1.0b and Streika 2.0 are the closest matches to each other, and somewhat close to Naum 3.1/4.2, while Fruit, Toga, Onno, and Loop are close to each other. Was the analysis incorrect? Rybka 3 and 4.1 are much less similar.<p>What analysis show that Rybka was ""a very close match to those of Fruity. Very close, as in much closer than any unrelated engines are to each other""? The dendrogram clearly shows Rybka 1.0 closer to Naum than to Fruit. Clearly it would be appropriate to compare to the similar methods of Naum.<p>I don't understand your statement ""It seems much more believe that substantial parts of the code of Rybka were copied verbatim from Fruit"". Quite clearly OpenOffice looks and feels like Microsoft Office, but just as clearly, the code was not copied verbatim from MS Office. Quite clearly Linux 1.0 was written with knowledge of how MINIX works, along with information from Sun and POSIX; I myself learned about OS design from Tannenbaum's MINIX textbook. But there's no credible claim that that Linux was copied verbatim from MINIX. Do you think Torvalds could have developed an OS from scratch, without any knowledge of how OSes work and without any standards?<p>People do write systems from scratch which are bug compatible. DR-DOS 5 was bug-compatible to MS-DOS. That was for commercial reasons. Researchers will implement someone else's algorithm so they have baseline comparison for alternate algorithm development. Free software people will rewrite software which isn't free. People who follow the kata development style will reimplement code just to get the feel for how that version is done.<p>So no, I have no problems in believing that someone would start with one method, do a deep analysis of another program, implement the ideas (but not copy the code!) and end up with similar results. While it may not be perfect clean-room style, it's still not in violation of the GPL.<p>If there's a GPL compliance issue, then where is the evidence of copyright infringement? All I've seen is examples of algorithm reimplementation.<p>Not only that, but I gather that there's a lot of reverse-engineering going on; how much of the other proprietary chess programs are similarly ""inspired"" by deep inspection of other implementations?",1325984625
