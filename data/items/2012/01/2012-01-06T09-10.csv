There is no intrinsic right there, ideas are not physical property, we should not treat them like they are.<p>I put creation in quotes, because of an issue that nicely demonstrates how fundamentally different ideas are from physical property: consider the many scientific/mathematic discoveries[1] that were made in parallel around the world, with no communication between the parties, who gains the right to ""own"" these ideas, and why should they? Did not somebody else take exactly the same amount of effort and process to create the exact same idea? This even applies to very complex systems that are far from obvious, quite novel, and form the foundations of our modern world.<p>People need to get past the idea that somebody has a brilliant idea one day out of the blue, and the world is changed forever because of it. Every idea anyone has ever had owes almost everything to what proceeded it, and the environment it arose in, co-discovery/invention is very solid proof of that.<p>""If I have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.""<p>When you take the time to realize the very thing that propels us forward is the ability to build on existing ideas, you realize how patents and IP law in general are impeding, not encouraging.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus#Modern"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus#Modern</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russels_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russels_paradox</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_of_the_telephone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invention_of_the_telephone</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientific_priority_disputes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scientific_priority_di...</a><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler%27s_law_of_eponymy</a><p>(there are several more, but i do not have the time just now to find them)",1325843954

Obviously an interviewer needs to have intimate familiarity with the problem that they give to potential employees, and have hands on experience implementing it in many variations. But that does not mean that it is unfair to ask this question because you do not know the answer.<p>This is a lot like fizzbuzz because the instructions for writing the code are simple, straightforward, and should be understandable by any programmer. This is not a question with an answer. This is a SPECIFICATION for a program. If you know how to code, it should be easy to write some code that meets this simple specification.<p>P.S. most interviewers will give you bonus points for explaining your work as you do it, particularly why you chose to use a certain approach, and what you assumed even though it was not explicitly specified. This is true even if you botch the end result and provide code with severe errors.<p>After all, that's what good coders do most of the time, write incorrect code with severe errors. The rest of the time they fix their mistakes.",1325843898

At that point, there's two options:<p>1. Migrate away from Google-hosted App Engine to your own AppScale instances.<p>2. Negotiate a better rate with Google.<p>In my experience App Engine has been fine for apps that only get a few hundred or thousand visits per day. The convenience of not worrying about the environment or deployment too much is a great enabler.<p>It definitely depends on the type of app. You probably wouldn't want to run anything that is particularly heavy on datastore use. Using AJAX rather than full pageloads is a good way to keep bandwidth and response time (and therefore instance hours) down. For example, one of my apps is able to pre-load the most important AJAX calls, so it can handle running with high latency and I don't exceed the free instance hours.",1325840901

Then modify the maps to map over 2 variables instead of one (like nested loops). The allocation is the x,y in sharpes() that gave sharpes.max, though I have no idea how to get that out of this language.<p>Edit: Ok, so you need to define another rho, and the problem is that a) not all mappings over x,y (0->1) are valid allocations a) the stocks are discrete.
