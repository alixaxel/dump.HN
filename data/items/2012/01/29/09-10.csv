A truly useful ""BioCAD"" isn't an engineering problem yet: there's a very substantial amount of basic research required.  Synthetic gene circuits evolve rapidly, for one: let's say you designed and ""CAD-tested"" your circuit, how will you keep it from mutating within a few days?  Unsolved research problem.<p>> Build a database for biology.<p>Better than Entrez/NCBI?  They have a <i>ton</i> of data.  Yes, not <i>particularly</i> user-friendly in the way the web community might be used to, but it has all of the data and biologists know how to read it.  What would you add?  (Yes, there's a lot to add -- but it's not a matter of a prettier UI, and NCBI does have an API already that people find usable).<p>> Reading DNA in vitro<p>What does this mean?  Sequencing DNA without extracting it from a cell?  Why?  Sequencing is largely a solved problem now.  Costs are dropping faster than Moore's law, and there's literally a thousand vendors who will do it.  Even synthesis is advancing so fast that people are beginning to talk about not doing subcloning anymore and just synthesizing the entire construct!  (Note that just because we can synthesize kbp oligos now doesn't mean that they're biologically useful in much other than bacteria and yeast, though... pesky things like epigenetic modifications and nucleosomes/genomic DNA packing... among others.)  Also, the extension of ""writ[ing] DNA sequences into plasmids using the capacitance of the cell wall via [a] nano tube"" seems a bit far from current technology.<p>That said, I think these are important problems and I'd <i>love love love</i> to see more people working on them versus more web and iphone apps!  This was not the list I expected to see, which is awesome.  But the biology-related ideas don't come across as being communicated with much sophistication.",1327830516

Second degree murder is still murder.<p>Now, if you think this was some kind of routine police enforcement action that got out of hand and that the company boss had nothing to do with it, then I don't think you know how things work, especially in places like India. The police chief and top brass would most likely be part of the same social circles and would look out for each other's interests. In corrupt places, the power of the state is always readily available to the rich and powerful, whether it's quelling a labour dispute in India or a low-interest Fed borrowing window.<p>Now, when I first read the title I was struck that a company president would be killed by workers, but after reading the article, it suddenly makes a lot more sense, doesn't it?<p>Now that I think about it, it's also pretty sad that the killing of a labour activist doesn't surprise or shock me, but the killing of an executive does.",1327828787
