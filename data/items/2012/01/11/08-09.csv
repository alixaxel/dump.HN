One prof I know pretty well, who's a good teacher, was lamenting that his students seem to actively <i>want</i> him to be definitive and un-nuanced. His tendency, which he has to work against a bit, is to qualify statements by noting where his views aren't shared by everyone in the field, where he's speculating past the established results, where he's pretty confident of an approach but there are arguments for alternative approaches, etc.<p>But students tend to interpret that as weak and muddled, and prefer profs who ""tell it like it is"", even if that means in a fairly biased and opinionated way.
