Just don't show the admissions committee real names, inform the committee only of a school ranking (not the specific school), and blank out specific extracurriculars that give away racial information.<p>Even better, you can just use a point system where everything is objectively measured. Strangely, many colleges dropped point systems after the supreme court ruled you cannot racially bias a point system (but you are allowed to racially bias a non-point system).<p><i>AA is specifically intended to discriminate against non-minorities in order to counter balance the discrimination that already exists against minorities.</i><p>If this were the true intent, you would expect that the college grades of AA beneficiaries and normal students would be similarly distributed.

Your HN post is much more interesting, and gives me a reason to ""follow"" you and your app (I don't have an iDevice so ordinarily I'd completely disregard your app). I suggest you write a blog with fairly frequent posts updating your progress. You can put more detail in a blog. At least, update your twitter feed more often, and keep it real so there's a personality behind it, not some marketing robot.<p>BTW to the people complaining about the fact that the app is only available at itunes, keep in mind these guys are strapped for resources.<p>People have suggested rebranding... I guess another option is to port to android and launch it there with all problems solved. Don't know how realistic that would be given they're low on resources.",1326030831

If no one else is solving it, it may be that the people with the problem won't pay, hence no providers.  If there's solutions out there, it does validate a market/problem/idea.<p>The trap I see some people fall in to is what you just advised - trying to come up with something ""totally new/unique"", when often there's no demand.  And when they see demand for X, they say ""oh, XYZ is already solving that"".  The trick is determining how well they're solving it, finding customers they won't/can't serve, and going after that.<p>But yeah, don't make a social app, don't give away free stuff, etc - all your ""don't""s - great list.  And yeah, making money is a good feeling.  It also gives you a much stronger position to explore new ideas from, rather than from a position of ""oh crap there's only 4 boxes of macaroni left and I'm late on my rent"".<p>EDIT: the 'great advice' really was meant to be 'great advice', not sarcastically spoken.

3439509,comment,3439277,3439277,6,0,PaulHoule,,,"This is the most interesting ""Tell HN"" I've seen in a while because it touches on many issues.<p>(1) A lot of us are attracted to SEO,  app stores,  and free and freemium business models because we don't want to do marketing.  It's clear that you need to work hard at marketing if you're trying to sell an enterprise product that costs $10,000/seat/year,  but people forget that a ""free"" website supported by advertising or a $5.99 app needs just us much work (and sometimes expense)<p>(2) For a long time I've been cynical about ""hyperlocal"" because it usually seems to mean ""San Francisco and Brooklyn"".  Put any thought of those two markets out of your mind,  because (a) you've got tough competition from VC-backed companies and (b) people who really think will think you're just another sheep.  You should target some second-tier market,  say Denver or Boston or Chicago or Washington, DC.  San Diego is probably OK.<p>(3) As for geotargeting,  there is a wide range of ""old school"" marketing channels that can be geotargeted.  These include advertising on local cable TV, weekly newspapers, radio as well as fliers, stickers, and the like.  You can also buy geotargeted ads on platforms like Facebook and Google.<p>(4) To saturate a target market takes more effort and/or money that most people want to spend.  If you can't afford to hit a second-tier market,  go for a third or fourth tier market.  I know of people in Ithaca NY that have been blanketing the downtown area with lawn signs and fliers to promote a new site -- this is a small enough market that a person can put up 500 fliers on bulletin boards on foot on a weekend.<p>(5) To drive your marketing campaign you may need to rustle up some cash.  Find a way to do it.<p>(6) Success in a target market can lead to you rustling up more cash for over markets,  getting publicity,  etc.<p>(7) 75 miles seems like a really long distance to me to hang out with people I don't know unless I share some kind of exceptionally strong interest with them.",1326030521

3439506,comment,3439277,3439277,2,0,mgkimsal,,,"A few points.<p>The idea to refocus on a few cities is probably the best shot you have at salvaging it.  I don't know if you've noticed, but almost any geo-social-network app launched always starts in 1 or 2 cities.  Frankly, it's annoying for pretty much everyone who doesn't live in SF (cause that's inevitably where the initial focus is) but there's a reason for it, and you've hit that reason.<p>Find a few cities where you've got friend/family/connections, rebrand the app for that city, and focus on getting everyone you can to help promote in that location.<p>Another idea - make brandable versions of this and sell them to convention centers or visitor bureaus.  Having an app that they promote to everyone visiting a city will ensure that people in a geo area - who don't know the area well and are looking to meet people for a bit - will be a win for you and a win for the city and bureau.  Branding it for each city separately or as part of a chain (""grooovy detroit"", ""grooovy dallas"", etc) - not sure which direction to go in, but I'd hit up visitor bureaus to see what they'd want and just go with that.<p>On a design standpoint - <a href=""http://gyazo.com/e5cba3c4db14db4f668a4a6c815b6c3a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gyazo.com/e5cba3c4db14db4f668a4a6c815b6c3a</a> - I'm running 1280x800 (not a totally uncommon resolution) and can't see half your call to action button for the app store).  Too much whitespace below the groovy logo.  Yeah, perhaps it seemed minor, but that's just one more nail that's making it look amateurish.  And there's nothing <i>wrong</i> with amateur, but you need to iterate and improve.  The one downside is you only get one shot to make a first impression with the people you've already first-impressioned.  Move on and find more people, but improve the site.<p>I agree with the other comments - ""create/connect/enjoy"" tells me nothing. All your action explanations are <i>way</i> down at the bottom, and even then they don't match up - the screen with ""snack/drinks/meal"" doesn't go with the text of ""snack/drinks/meal"".<p>This feels like a foursquare wannabe - badges and reviews?  There was <i>nothing</i> in any of your screenshots that actually showed me inviting friends or making new ones.  I thought that was the whole point - to meet people and make new friends.  Based on your HN post, that's it.  Based on the website, this is a coffeehouse review system.<p>My advice would be to not buy in to the tech porn that we all drink in way too much.  ""Believing"" in something doesn't really help all that much when basic mistakes are made or overlooked (not saying you fall in this camp 100%, but no one's perfect).  ""we tried to follow every piece of advice given"" sounds a bit more like desperation than conviction on the idea.  While I feel like I'm publicly beating you up here, I don't mean to be, and am actually very grateful that you've posted this.  We need more of these 'coming out' stories to show the human side of non-success (I won't say failure cause I don't think you're done with this yet!).  I've known several people over the years who've fallen in to similar situations as yours, and they feel very isolated and like personal failures because they're not the next Facebook.  Everyone else's successes look so easy, and you did everything they did, etc.  It's just not like that.  I sometimes feel I come across as a bit overly negative on the whole 'startup' scene, but I don't think I'm negative as much as a realist.  That realism just balances out so much positive hype that it seems negative :/<p>You're not a failure - someone with as much drive as you've demonstrated <i>will</i> end up being more successful in life at some point, but right now may not be the time.  Perhaps it's time to put some of these startup ideas on hold, rebuild some of your emotional and financial life, and come back to this world when you're more stable.  Right now I think almost any decisions you make will be from a position of financial, emotional and mental weakness, and I'd be pretty certain those decisions will not be beneficial to you.  As much as people want to celebrate the 'pulling all nighters' and 'last minute pitches when we had $5 left in the bank that led to $100 million buyout!' stories, the world <i>mostly</i> doesn't work that way. It'd be a lot easier to make more informed and well thought out decisions when you've got a year of savings in the bank.<p>For all the feedback you claim to have gotten during your dev, I don't think there's anything more revealing than getting a group of semi-anonymous tech geeks to give honest feedback on web sites/services.  Yes, get 'regular users' too, but you'll get a lot of great useful info from HN-type geeks because we can all relate our own successes and failures in to your project as well.  Not saying we can all predict successes, but being able to learn what works and what doesn't (plenty-of-fish style outliers aside) may have saved you more time and heartache months ago.  Gosh... perhaps an HN-style ""review my app idea"" - without dozens of flashy ads and hype - might be worth pursuing?  You still end up with chicken-egg situation - who will use it without intelligent reviewers already there?  I think there's some review services out there sort of like that, but nothing I've seen that can bring out the level of detail, experience and honesty like HN.<p>FWIW, thank you for posting so honestly here.",1326030405

They want someone who owns the platform they can thump in the head when something goes wrong.  They want complicated features to centralize control.   They want the operating systems quickly patched when vulns are published.<p>The Android ecosystem is a disaster, in this regard.  By separating the roles into OS developer, manufacturer and carrier (Google, HTC/Samsung/etc, Verizon/AT&T/etc respectively), it's created an environment with too many mixed incentives -- many that are at odds with the customer's needs.<p>Google produces the operating system, the manufacturer adds their customizations to differentiate, then also adds per-carrier tailoring.  The carriers then have to validate/test and release.<p>Motorola detailed this process as an excuse/apology/statement in early December. [1]<p>New OS upgrades and security patches become the responsibility of the manufacturer, but the manufacturer's incentives to support the hardware platform for the long-term are weak -- in fact, if the platform is doing poorly, they are incentivized to do the opposite: cut their losses and move on.   As customers, our influence is limited, since our relationships are with the carriers.<p>This if further complicated by the manufacturers rapid iterations with various hardware designs, to try and find the right price points to compete with the iPhone.  They're shipping hardware platforms barely capable of running the current version of the OS, with no roadmap for future software upgrades.<p>Apple has done a great job managing the platform, but they do so in their typical Apple style: with little communication and inconsistent rapidity of responses.  Being held at arms length and kept in the dark is not reassuring to any CISO whose enterprise data dependent upon the platform's security.<p>Of course, I think it's a safe bet those CISOs are more comfortable with Apple's silence than Android's clear security failures.<p>DeGusta's chart from October [2] captured much of this.  There are hardware platforms where we sign two year agreements with the carrier, but receive only <i>four months</i> of security patches from the manufacturer.  In whose world is that acceptable?<p>There are signs Microsoft recognizes the security updates problems and is putting the infrastructure in place to manage updates themselves, independent of carrier.  [3]  There are also signs they recognize the challenges Android's laissez faire hardware specs brings, and are more tightly controlling the hardware requirements. [4]<p>Microsoft's focus so far has been consumer-oriented, initial traction and to establish the ecosystem to allow  _any_ platform.  Ars had a writeup last week that captured current status in typical Ars completeness. [5]  They'll work it out eventually.  Microsoft can't fail in this, and the carrier and hardware manufacturers _want_ an alternative to the Apple gorilla.   The next year will see some pivots, compromises and changes -- but ultimately they'll work it out.<p>And by then they'll have taken over the enterprise market.<p>1 - <a href=""http://www.motorola.com/blog/2011/12/07/motorola-update-on-ice-cream-sandwich/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.motorola.com/blog/2011/12/07/motorola-update-on-i...</a><p>2 - <a href=""http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphans-visualizing-a-sad-history-of-support"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theunderstatement.com/post/11982112928/android-orphan...</a><p>3 - <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/11/windows-phone-7-updates-can-carriers-block-them.ars?comments=1&start=80"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/11/windows-phone-...</a><p>4 - <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/243268/microsoft_quietly_changes_wp7_specs_to_allow_phones_without_cameras.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/243268/microsoft_quietly_chan...</a><p>5 - <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/12/is-windows-phones-consumer-focus-killing-it.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/12/is-windows-pho...</a>",1326028617
