It gives the poor a way to earn a living, an activity to count on, some sense of being independent (instead of relying on welfare), and it enables them to save (even a little) money. It makes them responsible. It provides them experience that they can build on to become better at what they do and aspire for something a little more advanced. Most poor people who work do not stay at the bottom of their society for their whole life. Work is an effective social ladder, and where we stand right now is the downright proof of it.<p>""Exploitation"" is only a matter of point of view.

But you're either a perfectionist, or have no contact or experience with anyone living in poverty. Keeping people who are impoverished out of trouble and giving them a job no matter how demeaning is the most important first step. Believe me, I live in St. Louis, We're tied with Detroit for having the most violent crime in the whole United States. Poor people living the ghetto are not all the ""poor souls being taken advantage of"" that you think they are. Those people need discipline, a job, and ANY kind of income. No one will hire them for a reason. They're not just well behaved people sitting around hoping for a miracle. They have serious behavioral problems that really hurt their ability to have ANY kind of job. And a mechanical Turk solution is the last hope for many of them.<p>Also, in your attempt to achieve ""perfect"" you will end up achieving nothing.<p>I understand your thought process and it DOES make sense but we are not living in a perfect world, we are living in capitalism. And if you don't pay poor people in America a few pennies to type in ""cat"" next to a picture of a cat, that business owner will go to another country and get them to type ""cat"" next to a picture of a cat.<p>In the perfect world this wouldn't be an issue, there would be a world wide minimum wage but there isn't. So we have to stick with what works, not what's perfect. Not what's right. Not what's correct. But what works at the moment. That's what the world was built on.",1330318287

There's no where new left to go to. If society wanted to start over and try out a new government that's next to impossible without serious bloodshed because there's no land left to escape to and settle on. You have to take it from someone else. Just look at the Palistinian/Israeli conflict. Ownership over one little strip of land has caused so much bloodshed and destroyed so many lives. On top of that, all the good spots have already been taken (fertile land). But with virtual reality you can simulate all of these things.<p>In it's current form ""second life"" is a sad representation of virtual reality because of a lack of advancement in the underlying technology.

In the future Virtual Reality will be the ultimate escape. Look at how desperate people are to escape reality already. They drink themselves to near death, LSD, Weed, hallucinogens, meth, anti-depressants. People are so desperate to escape the pain of reality that they are even willing to self destruct and put themselves in deliberate harm.

And while most backup services like CrashPlan or Mozy or whatever definitely are the bottleneck, if you are backing up to your own remote servers, or to AWS via something like Arq, the speed really makes a difference, just as much as with a LAN (at least up to 100Mbps with AWS, anyway... at that point I think they become the gating factor).<p>I agree you don't get a <i>huge</i> benefit when surfing normal Internet websites, and that the benefits break down when the remote end of the connection is international, but for stuff like the above, the faster the better.",1330316063
