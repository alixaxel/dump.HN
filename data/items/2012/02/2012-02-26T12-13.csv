3635521,comment,3633910,3635268,4,0,coolestuk,,,"You are wrong on so many levels (and I'm not a jew).  When zionism was created in the late 19th century, most jews in the world had NO interest in moving to Palestine or being zionists.  Ask yourself the question: why if they believe that the land that is now Israel was theirs on the basis of religion, why were so many jews uninterested in pursuing this?  Zionism was a reaction to the hundreds of years of anti-semitism jews had endure.  Most jews rejected zionism (which was a nationalist movement not a religious movement).  Most jews wanted to stay where they were and wanted to be part of the country in which they lived.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Zionism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Zionism</a><p>The state of Israel arose from two factors. 1. The zionist movement which provided a narrative framework (historical, geographical, political, religious). 2. 70 years later, the attempt by the Nazis (and muslims like the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem) to wipe out jews.  The Nazis wasnted the jews out of europe; fanatical muslims like the Mufti wanted them out of the middle east.  (Some fanatical Nazis and some fanatical muslims wanted the jews wiped out.  Some fanatical muslims still want the jews wiped out in toto).  If you haven't read the Life of Mohammed (the first and most orthodox interpretation of Mohammed's life) you can read a condensed version here.   <a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/27156626/The-Earliest-Biography-of-Muhammad-By-Ibn-Ishaq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/27156626/The-Earliest-Biography-of...</a> You will see that already in the 7th century, Mohammed was exterminating jews.<p>The markings that the Nazis used for jews, originated in muslim countries in the middle ages, where jews (and christians) were made to wear special symbols to make them aware of their sub-human status in the eyes of muslims (dhimmitude).  Later, christians in Spain (having pushed out the invading armies of islam after several hundred years of violent domination) also made jews wear stars, and that was adopted again by the Nazis.  But the idea originated with the muslim concept of dhimmitude.<p>After what the Nazis did to jews in Europe, no wonder many jews embraced the idea of Israel as a safe(r) place for them to live (although millions of jews who went to Israel were actually kicked out of muslim north africa and Iraq, and all their wealth confiscated).  If jews were going to face potential extermination in the future, then it made sense to defend themselves in their historical homeland (go on the Tunnel Tour in Jerusalem, and see the historical evidence for their great civilisation before the time of Herod).<p>Since you are Dutch, what do you make of the best film ever made by Dutch director Paul Verhoeven?  I'm talking about Black Book, the film most Dutch people will not watch, because it shows the extent of the collaboration between Dutch people and the Nazis in the persecution of Dutch jews. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389557/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0389557/</a><p>And since the media goes on and on about ""the Palestinian refugees"", I suggest you read this, and see how the UN manages to manufacture a refugee crisis unlike no other in history: <a href=""http://www.danielpipes.org/10695/unrwa-palestine-refugees"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danielpipes.org/10695/unrwa-palestine-refugees</a><p>It seems to me that jews have suffered so much prejudice and hostility over the centuries, they have adopted far thicker skins than the rest of us.  And I think that many of us non-jews are too ready to channel the history of jew-hatred from our the past of our cultures.  And sadly, I think I was one of those people.",1330260992

Real innovation is not done at Google or Facebook or Apple for that matter. Those companies are too tied to meeting quarterly results to invest in real innovation.<p>I think the other important implication is that the US doesn't have an entity like Bell Labs innovating today.

If so, is it one of the older ones like SM-2 or one of the complex ones that eliminates the ""whoops I missed a day"" problem?<p>Rather than make a custom deck for Anki or Mnemosyne, you're reinventing the wheel a lot by writing your own SRS.

Have you found that the Supermemo/Anki/Mnemosyne approach of users self-reporting their accuracy isn't as reliable as using handwriting recognition?<p>As for marketing, there's a sizeable community of people already using spaced repetition software for learning Japanese, and they tend to be centered around forum.koohii.com and alljapaneseallthetime.com (although I'm not sure how much activity the latter gets nowadays).  They use SRS to commit to memory the mnemonics in James Heisig's Remembering the Kanji.

3635445,comment,3633993,3634541,1,0,Gatsky,,,"So we are talking about modifying the human organism at birth. There are a couple of things to consider if you start doing this.<p>1. If you correct the enzyme deficiency, you will create a new genetic disease caused by a deficiency in that enzyme. You won't be able to successfully correct it in everyone, and even if you do, there will still be children born with the deficiency due to random variation. (Given that the deficiency isn't detrimental in our society otherwise we would all have scurvy, there is no selection pressure to remove it from the gene pool, so there may actually end up being a fairly large number of people with this deficiency unless you keep gene editing every child.) Now, you have an ethical obligation to find these deficeint kids who would have been 'normal' 5 years ago and look after them, and make sure they eat enough vegetables. This means once you start correcting the gene deficiency, you have to screen every baby to make sure they are corrected.<p>2. It is very difficult to prove that correcting this enzyme is not somehow dangerous, especially since nobody gets scurvy apart from the occasional university student. The point here is that there is almost nothing to gain by correcting it in a society which has the money and technology to actually do it. You therefore must go to great lengths to prove that correcting this deficiency is safe. This will take probably 2 generations of humanity and several hundred thousand people from all ethnicities. Looking at the biochemical pathway someone has drawn on a whiteboard and saying ""It should be ok."" isn't good enough.<p>I would also say that I have never heard anyone who actually studies biology complain that the designs are 'dumb'. Filled with wonder, perplexed, humbled etc would be more common responses...",1330258115
