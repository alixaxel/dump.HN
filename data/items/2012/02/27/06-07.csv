3638025,comment,3637599,3637599,12,0,zanny,,,"Nobody seems to be asking, but I will - why isn't network cable grouped under the same class of utilities provided by local governments that include roads, sewers, and in some countries, electricity?<p>I know in America we have the completely stupid system where electricity is at a regulated rate but privately provided by a given monopoly company at any given household.<p>That is actually another example of the problem.  If governments didn't suck, and our collective interests were not clouded and in general ill thought, we would have fiber to the home be a national works project to help pull the country out of the recession.<p>It is currently so expensive to lay fiber because the demand and supply are in this convoluted state, where no one demands it due to the monopolies so no one makes it in great quantity so prices are artificially high so no one wants it.<p>If we had a gov't project to lay fiber, the massive demand (unless the gov't did the entire supply chain like they did with the NHS) would spur industry growth, and we could then export our huge fiber industry (which is high tech manufacturing, like carbon nanotubes would be in bulk) to everyone else and actually have industry again.<p>Of course, that would never happen, because governments almost never do anything right.  And if they do it right, they do it insanely over budget and late.  But it is nice to dream.<p>I think it might possibly work at the local level.  It doesn't have the huge instantaneous demand boom of the material as a national project, but regions that have access to the raw components used in fiber tubing (sand is a silica right?  Not pure enough I assume, we make the stuff somewhere out of silicates though) could subsidize and start the industry, and then sell the company after they spur demand by using their own fiber supply to give every home 100 gigabit internet connections.<p>Fast forward a decade and the initial cost investment to build the industry would be paying dividends in national productivity and the export market we would have for fiber.  Rather than go from (on average) 56 kbps internet in 2000 to 300kbps in 2012, we could have a third of the population on fiber in a decade.<p>It really comes back to infrastructure.  Nobody makes subways or national transit systems or lays railroads across the nation unless there is a huge unrealistic demand that forces businesses to act or if the collective power of representational government uses the investment potential of taxpayers to create and fund the services that make everyone's lives better but no one can justify giving on a case by case basis for a quick profit in the next quarter financial report.<p>Alas, pipe dreams.  I wish I had sonic, I get the lovely fun of picking between the staunchly competitive only ISP in my area that provides single banded DSL at 300 kbps for $50 over the copper phone lines that have been in the ground for half a century.

Why shouldn't our operating systems/environments be stored ""in the cloud""?""<p>Clouds go down, your computer goes down. There's no compelling reason to put the OS ""in the cloud"". Your data? Maybe, if you can handle not having access to it every second of the day. And even today, one can RDP or VNC perfectly comfortably on a 20Mbps connection provided all the ""cloudy"" parts of the internet behave. More importantly, if the server and the links between you and the server aren't capable of giving you 100mbps then you <i>can't</i> saturate the connection.<p>""Why shouldn't I have more than one computer in my house?""<p>How does not having a 1Gbps internet connection prevent this?<p>""Remind me again why I can't have cameras all over my house and see them all at once while somewhere else.""<p>Why can't you do that today? Streaming 1080p from x-number of cameras, multiplexed into a single display that's probably no better than 1080p is silly. The proper approach, regardless of bandwidth, is to downsample the displays before multiplexing at the broadcast side. Then you're just streaming a single video stream anyways, which is perfectly doable at 20Mbps.<p>""Why shouldn't I be able to speak to an SO wondering around the house doing chores while I'm in a hotel room?""<p>Again, why can't you do that today? There's no reason to stream video from empty parts of the house. In your use-case, you're only sending one or two video streams at a time anyway...again still healthily within the realm of 20Mpbs.<p>""All that aside, think of the games and entertainment that can be enabled. TVs are large enough to be almost life size now. Why shouldn't I be able to stand in front of one with a doctor or Amazon employee on the other side being able to examine each other, products, packaging etc in high resolution detail. (Note 1080 is not even close to high resolution for life size.)""<p>This is the only compelling case you've provided I think, but bandwidth is not the principle problem in this use-case. Everything from cameras to encoders to compressors to display devices are a bigger problem in this case.<p>And yes, you'll have to compress even at 1gbps. A 1920x1080 display with 24bit color at 60fps is something like 3GigaBytes per second or around 24gbps.<p>The next gen of TV is likely to be some variant of super hi-vision which is 7680x4320. @24bit and 60fps that's just shy of 48Gigabytes per second uncompressed or 384gbps.<p>So yeah, bandwidth will be a bottleneck in those applications, but 1gbps is not even close to handling it and I'm guessing the hardware required to real-time encode and compress video for a stream like that is astronomical.",1330325094

A normal office worker has a ton of files already. It may be messy, but the world at large at least have some sort of workflow they carved out over the years of using the typical user facing filesystem.  I can't imagine most people know how to get these files onto their iOS devices using iCloud. My iOS addicted family certainly doesn't. I honestly don't even really get it. If properly presented by HTC/Dropbox/Android, it is a superior solution.<p>Rather that trying to figure out what the user wants and often frustrating them with invisible restrictions, a Dropbox solution just powerfully augments what the normal person already does on a computer. Put all of your stuff here. Press on your file, you get presented with a series of apps that can work with your stuff. And when you are done, put it back in the box that magically keeps all of your stuff. And the stuff in this box will work with any application that can parse that particular file on your phone/tablet/laptop/work computer, not just on a certain subset of apps on a certain subset of devices.",1330324300
