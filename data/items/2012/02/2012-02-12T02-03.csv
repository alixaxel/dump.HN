There are no standards - there are suggestions (RFCs), lots of open stuff (open source, free, whatever), and some closed stuff,  and then there's what really happens.<p>It turns out that IPv4 and DNS worked pretty well, though of course the internet at-large only uses a portion of those ""standards"".    We didn't need an organization to tell us every last little detail and how it would work and ""approve"" it before we use it.  People found out what worked, documented it, and it became the de-facto standard.  We've never waited on the various internet ""governing"" bodies while keeping our own progress at bay.  THere's absolutely no reason to.<p>Know why everyone (more or less) obeys the allocations issued by ARIN? Because we recognize someone has to manage that limited resource pool, and they do an okay job of it.  We're all free, more or less, to set up networks in whatever way we want, with whatever IP space we want - we just can't expect cooperation from our neighbours without some discussion and agreement so we don't stomp on each other's space - so we look to ARIN and their brethren to manage this.  If they ceased to do so efficiently, they'd be replaced.<p>The W3C has no power to force a developer or vendor to implement a given feature or not, and nobody really cares whether or not something is ""officially"" compliant. 
Most web pages are not fully compliant... yet the web, built by kids and adults and everything in between grew up and here we are, talking on HN.<p>It'd be great if people could agree when we end up with overlapping features from different vendors...... it makes it hard for the developers right?  That should be obvious to all. 
But we've switched browsers over the years, and will again, and whichever ones actually do what people need them to do, as well as keep developers happy, will prosper - w3c has little to do with it as far as I can see.<p>Same for DNS (gripes aside - let's be realistic).<p>We implemented IPv4 and it works great, but does the internet at large obey the type of service bits which are part of that standard? heck no.  It's a big, evolving, organic thing.<p>The web  - same deal.  Know what makes a standard? Something people adopt and continue using.  Usage defines the standards - nobody is compelled to do anything just because it's a ""standard"" according to some group.",1329013683

There is nothing in law today that would prevent anyone from building a more effective business model that doesn't depend on copyright, if they can find one. If it's as easy as the copyright opponents make out to produce works without relying on the copyright protections afforded by the law today, <i>why is hardly anyone doing so</i>?<p>Right now, the only people who are making serious money from creative content using alternative business models tend to be keeping that content locked up via technical means so consumers can't just copy it, as with software-as-a-service, pay-per-view TV, and the like. Advertising also works, up to a point, but the serious money there isn't going to the content generators in most cases, it's going to the middlemen like Google and Facebook, and obviously ad-ridden content gives an inferior experience for consumers.<p>> And I'm of the opinion that most politicians are looking more for an excuse than for a real argument too.<p>Perhaps, but they're not all completely clueless, as the hesitation over PIPA/SOPA and ACTA in the face of widespread popular dissent has shown.<p>My concern is that if we don't achieve a fundamental shift in perceptions and attitudes to content production/consumption among the political classes, building on those recent successes, then that will be game over because sooner or later the lobbying will result in the kind of crackdown Big Media wants.<p>This issue needs to become politically toxic, so no-one who needs to be re-elected wants to touch anything associated with Big Media lobbying.

I recently ported over a networking library I wrote in python to ruby, and the requests per second (CPU limited in this case, since it was talking over a loopback socket -- this was just a test of how fast data could be serialized/deserialized) dropped from 7000 requests/sec in python to 120 in ruby. And that was just with standard CPython. Under PyPy, I was able to process about 20,000 requests/sec after letting the JIT warm up.<p>I realize it's sort of silly to choose a dynamically typed interpreted language on the grounds of performance when you're already giving up so much performance regardless, but in my mind python hits the sweet spot of ""just fast enough for most things I need to do"", and with all other things being roughly equal (which, in my opinion, they roughly are), being an order of a magnitude factor faster wins out.",1329012605

But as soon as we're going into public beta, we'll probably have to produce high quality examples for different audiences, that's right.<p>We're not trying to replace analog media. I think that's kind of impossible. But we're working on ways to augment them (for example making it very easy to capture a white board or scribbled notes).",1329012117
