It's not necessary for the client to expire their entire cache all at once - this would be incredibly foolish.<p>If you make a GET request against a REST interface then you should cache the results of that request and note the datetime you made it.<p>If you need to make a subsequent request against the same resource then you can first make a HEAD request to get only the headers. By comparing timestamps you can see whether or not the resource has changed since you last accessed it.<p>If the REST interface is appropriately designed then the ""last changed"" value will propagate upwards from the leaves of the tree towards the API root. So caching the results of requests can save you from making an immense number of requests.",1328137112

The increase was due primarily to a 69% increase in advertising revenue to $3,154 million. Advertising revenue grew due to a 42% increase in thenumber of ads delivered and an 18% increase in the average price per ad delivered. The increase in ads delivered was driven primarily by user growth. The number of ads delivered was also affected by many other factors including product changes that significantly increased the number of ads on many Facebook pages beginning in the fourth quarter of 2010, partially offset byan increase in usage of our mobile products, where we do not show ads, and by various product changes implemented in 2011that in aggregate modestly reduced the number of ads on certain pages. The increase in average price per ad delivered was affected by factors including improvements in our ability to deliver more relevant ads to users and product changes that contributed to higher user interaction with the ads by increasing their relative prominence.",1328137107

3540456,comment,3540167,3540167,1,0,padwiki,,,"This is a fantastic article, and really hit home with our project. The rules of deflationary economics has become common knowledge in most product and service industries, but in my industry (higher education), the opposite seems to be true. Every single legitimate competitor raises prices year after year, much faster than the rate of inflation. The few that don't (Khan, MITx, Stanford, Udemy, etc...) do so by scaling back the user experience, reducing difficulty and removing credentialing. This means the value proposition to the student, even at no cost, will not match the entrenched system. There is a market for this new class of product, but it is defining a new market rather than competing in the existing one.<p>I actually think the reason more companies don't follow the strategy he outlines is that it is just too damn tempting to take the quick cash. For example, the current market value of our product is in the $500-$2500 per credit hour ($2,000-$10,000 per class) range. We could charge in this range and be extremely profitable. Instead, we price our classes at $100 per credit hour, pay our professors a much higher percentage and choose to take a slimmer margin. In classical ""next quarter"" business terms, this is a very bad business decision. Doing so, however, opens up a number of opportunities that our competitors can't exploit. For instance:<p>We had to develop technology and workflow that dropped the cost of high quality interactive content down from $10,000 per hour (or more) to around $120 per hour. Now that we have that option, we can scale our course offerings extremely rapidly while keeping costs at a minimum.<p>Being able to offer a bachelors degree for less than $10k (masters less than half that) gives us options for creative financing of education that again, our much higher priced competition just don't have. Student loans no longer become necessary, even without subsidies. State and federal subsidies could easily cover the entire cost of tuition (California currently spends more than $12,000 per student per year just at the community college level). Also, as our first program is CS/SE, there are many companies with a vested interest in increasing the number of graduates and having access after they graduate. The point is, we expect to be able to offer most of our programs at no cost to the student within a few years.<p>Since our largest cost saving was in not having any buildings, we are not limited by a physical infrastructure when it comes to scaling. We also designed our system to benefit from having more students, which means the quality of our program will increase as we grow...something that can't be said about many physical campuses.<p>TL:DR; Higher education is about to enter the tornado.",1328136356

Types will have to be translated; memory models will need to be aligned and compilers will need to 'play nice' together. This is not just as the compiled object level but at the ABI level during linking etc.</i>
I've spent more time solving issues with memory models in C++ than I have in any other language because C++ has no ABI - I've had patches to MSVC change the memory layout of objects and cause breakage which is just as bad as you get with any sort of language interop scenario.<p><i>Performance: This new language is super fast. Great, but it will have to work with existing systems. The interface between the two will slow stuff down a lot...</i>
Seeing as C++ has no ABI, there's no non-hacky way to provide a C++ binary shared library that doesn't end up using a very small subset of C++ (for example, no STL, since it's all templated, meaning the code your compiler generates won't interoperate with the code the client's compiler), which means people end up wrapping their C++ code with C APIs.<p><i>Build: ... </i>
#include is a broken piece of legacy that everyone will be happy to see disappear - give us real modules instead of a compilation model which pastes file contents inside other files. Also, C++ compile times are ridiculously long compared to a modern CFG-based language (that's disregarding the fact that compilers often disagree as to what's valid code because of the extremely complicated syntax of the language).<p><i>Debugging: ...</i>
Debugging modern code that uses shared_ptr, bind, etc. is such a massive pain in the ass because you end up mixing the code you care about with those plumbing details - ""step into "" becomes useless. Add the fact that there is no ABI and you find yourself unable to introspect objects at runtime when compiled in release mode (where all the nasty memory issues tend to show up)<p><i>Team Training: ... </i>
C++ is, as I've been ranting, complicated. I've been using it for a long time, and there's still no language in which I fear making subtle mistakes that'll cause hard-to-diagnose bugs (for example, exceptions are often treated as an anti-pattern because it's so hard not to make such mistakes using them)<p><i>Team Embedded Knowledge: ...</i>
This is a valid point. I don't think it's worth the price you pay for using C++...<p><i>[Ecosystem complaints - tooling, licensing, lifespan]</i>
Beyond the fact that tooling for managed languages is often superior to C++ (because of the better-controlled memory layout and execution model), these are valid points.<p><i>Startup And Shut-down Sub-Systems: ...</i>
This is also broken in C++ - in what order are static objects initialized (definition order inside a cpp file, file sequences are random)? What happens if one wants to refer to another?
I know these are solvable issues, but every single one of them requires thought and effort on the programmer's side, and these aren't the sort of issues that a programmer should be wasting his time on.<p><i>Paradigm Contamination: ...</i>
Yes, writing in a language and writing idiomatically in a language are two different things, but modern, idiomatic C++ is both something I've seen few people who know (compared to out-dated and dangerous practices), and it still requires more effort to keep in mind than, say, writing idiomatic python, or C#, or java.<p><i>Brain Strain (the bilingual problem): ...</i>
This isn't really an argument - it's speculation. I could say that perhaps the fact that C++ is so varied that different subsets of it end up looking like different languages, and all of them with more details you have to keep in mind to make sure you aren't breaking stuff subtly. Also, being bilingual also provides cognitive advantages, so even that flawed analogy might not be proving the point.<p><i>Let us think about the big ideas behind Go: [snip] Well, one can write simple clean C++ and use share_ptr. Just because C++ can be super complex does not mean it has to be.</i>
Unless, say, you're writing a DLL (another fun fact: not only can your API not have STL, exceptions also can't cross DLL boundaries), or you're using DLLs written by other poor souls who were consigned to writing DLLs with a C++ API.<p>This is not to say that C++ has no place in software development (I use it daily at work), but I'm of the opinion that unless you have a really good reason, avoid it like the plague. New languages taking over more niches C++ used to occupy is a good trend.<p>As a finishing note, one of my favorite articles on the subject of complexity in programming: <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/09/23.html</a>",1328134896

3540314,comment,3538585,3539880,1,0,jalfresi,,,"I agree, I too have seen lots of discussions of how to format links in JSON. As you noted, JSON is not a hypermedia format per se, but if you use the Link HTTP header you can add hypermedia to non-hypermedia mediatypes. Here is a quick example:<p>HTTP Response:<p><pre><code>  HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
  ...
  Link: <http://example.com/some-resource>; rel=""edit"";
         title=""Edit some resource""
  Content-type: application/json

  {""prop"":""val""}

</code></pre>
You should be able to see that the link header contains a target url, a relation and optional title. The Link header maps almost exactly to the HTML Link element.<p>I agree, I havent seen a ""true"" RESTful service either, except for very simple examples. As others have noted, REST is quite a difficult architectural style to summarise in a few short pithy statements, which leads a lot to the confusion on implementation. I also think that the fact that the architectural style is defined by constraints, which traditionally flies in the face of all previous architectural styles I have seen, which emphasise features and what you CAN do. REST is about what you DONT do. Its these restrictions that combine to make something very powerful, flexible and scalable. Think chess: its a stupid game with a board limited in size, the pieces all move in complicated but specific ways. It cant possibly be an interesting and deep game with all these constraints!<p>If you are interested in discussions on the subject, I recommend joining the rest-discuss mailing list on Yahoo Groups. Sure the conversation veers into hand-wavy, ivory tower territory, which can be forgiven seeing as the discussion group is for exactly this, but you get some very comprehensive and detailed explanations. Definitely search the archives because a lot of stuff has been answered in great detail before. Roy Fielding even pops on sometimes to correct a few points, and you dont get much more authoritative on the subject than that :)",1328134774

It was a bad decision to go down this route for me. I'd have been better off with Java/J2EE. Why?<p>Confidence. MS has pretty much no direction with respect to their development tools roadmap and ideals. They seem to put feelers out in every direction, then cut a few directions off randomly based on how people react. That's bad if you've bet your business or career on it. They only do this because they have the cash. Examples of their current creepy tentacles which are at risk: PHP, Silverlight, Hadoop, even Java on Azure, Entity Framework, Metro.<p>Complexity. Everything is utterly overcomplicated. I am referring to the W<i></i> products. WCF covers most of the ""virtually impossibly overspecced"" WS-* specifications which are pretty much never used in the real world (most companies use hack jobs for integration TBH). WPF and WWF are simply slow to build software with, induce horrid levels of coupling and untestability and have an extremely high learning curve for even simple tasks. I won't even mention Win32 if you have to go that low - it's an utter minefield.<p>High rate of crap employees. Seriously, I have interviewed at least 200 already employed people over the last 10 years in this sector. I've hired about 10. That's how low the bar is for getting in. It's damn hard to get rid of people once you've hired them in the UK as well so you have to be careful.<p>Churn rate. Utterly obsolete and expensive training (some of which is just completely wrong), no reliable roadmap, new platforms every 5 minutes to tie you into their product ecosystem and proprietary and illogical ways of doing things. Once you're in, it's hard to get out. People don't treat you with respect if you want to switch out of that side of the industry as they know about the ""high rate of crap employees"" as mentioned above. Also .Net software houses are usually a monoculture so it's hard to prove experience in something else, even if half your kit is Linux.<p>Lack of out of box solutions or free solutions. Everything is pay pay pay or build build build. If you want to integrate with Word documents, pay. If you want to integrate SVN with your IDE, pay. That is pay per server, per seat, per user, per atom if they could. If you want to wire X up with Y then you'll have to write your own shims. With the Java/Ruby/Python ecosystems, everything you need is out there for nothing - it just needs assembling.<p>Patterns and practices team. They are a joke. Utter mess. Nothing coherent, cohesive or useful come out of them. They don't even compare to the J2EE blueprints layed out back in 2002 which are pretty darn obsolete. Most of their own products ignore the P&P team's advice as it's shit.<p>Now this may sound like bitterness or diatribe but this is how it really is.<p>I carefully avoid mentioning the language above which is irrelevant - it's the ecosystem that's fucked.",1328134384

Tell me more about the C++ bindings to C libraries and how they are never used in production.<p>His complaint about 'Performance' is similar FUD.

The computer really doesn't give two shits what language caused the stack pointer to move--it doesn't matter. This isn't a valid complaint.<p>His lambda is dumb. He didn't do anything there that couldn't have been done with a function pointer, C-style. If he was trying to show why C++11 lambdas are cool, he failed.<p>(and his code looked like garbage, as others here have mentioned... elegant my ass.
