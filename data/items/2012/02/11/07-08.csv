There is no reason why my status update to ANY service should require my location, and luckily at the moment you can opt-out from ever having to send a location. I am very happy that Apple required the App to ask for permissions first (on an API level) and wish they would implement this further for a few more of the API's (such as Contacts which was brought up here recently).<p>I still find it funny when even adults don't seem to realize that they are advertising their current location to anyone and everyone all around the globe. People continue to use Foursquare to let the world know they are on vacation making them simpler targets for thieves that want to burglar their homes, they make themselves easy to follow around. For some people the FBI need not plant a GPS tracker, the subject themselves accurately documents everything and everything they do.",1328946942

3578811,comment,3577454,3578735,1,0,csallen,,,"<p><pre><code>  > Piracy is where the consumer side of a transaction takes \n    without permission. That's cheating. It is immoral.\n</code></pre>\nThat's not what piracy is, actually. Piracy is simply ""an infringement of copyright"". And copyright is the exclusive right to copy a work, distribute it for sale to the public, perform it publicly, display it publicly, or create derivatives from it. It's not really comparable to a normal transaction.<p><pre><code>  > It sounds like you believe personal financial gain is\n    inherently immoral. Many people do feel this way. Many\n    people don't.\n</code></pre>\nWell, that's not really what I believe. I do own a company after all. It doesn't get much more financial gain-seeking than that :)<p>The original intention of copyright was as follows: Ideas, expression, and information have no owners. They belong to the public because of free speech and all. However, this discouraged their creation, because if you wrote a book someone could just put their name on it and mass-produce it, giving you no credit. So lawmakers said how about we give authors a <i>limited</i> time to benefit financially from copyright. That will be a great incentive for them to create new works. However, after that time ends, the public should enjoy unrestricted use. That way we don't create monopolies on free speech and expression.<p>My problem is that we're straying from this original intent. The entire purpose was to <i>prevent</i> monopolies* on information. You used to only have copyrights for 28 years, max, before the public got full control over it. Since then, content companies and artists have endlessly lobbied Congress to give them more power, and today copyrights last an entire lifetime PLUS 70 years. Nothing <i>ever</i> enters the public domain.<p>So the real question is: How can you argue that copyright infringers are immoral, when the reality is that copyright holders are the ones who've violated the original intent of the law purely for personal gain? Their actions are ion violation of almost every moral foundation you listed (fairness, liberty, authority, betrayal, degradation).<p><pre><code>  > You should assume the opposite of your bias and form\n    your argument on that basis. It will make for a stronger \n    argument.\n</code></pre>\nThanks for the feedback.",1328946745
