But I saw things floating in the air, like holograms of objects.  And somehow I knew, I was still sleeping, but not sleeping.  What I saw was a perfect memory recall of my room, a place I had seen thousands of times.

3623815,comment,3620432,3622636,2,0,Silhouette,,,"> DRM is wrong. It doesn't not produce a better environment for the consumer because it reduces competition.<p>The fundamental flaw in your argument is that you assume we would still have the same content available to consume without DRM.<p>However, the whole reason to allow copyright in the first place is to create an economic incentive for those who can to create and share works. And the whole point of DRM is that people weren't honouring copyrights, so the incentive wasn't working. Clearly there is not sufficient incentive for the major content producers to share their movies via on-line systems without DRM right now, because they have almost unanimously refused to work with such systems, and no-one has been able to force them to do so through commercial pressure.<p>> A market with DRM would have the same impact on innovation as a SOAP-based market.<p>The market already has DRM, and there are more (legal) ways to get access to the latest video content today than at any time in human history. But right now, implementing adequate DRM takes more effort than it should, and <i>that</i> has an impact on innovation by at best reducing the efficiency of services working with DRM'd content and at worst rendering services that would otherwise have been successful and beneficial to consumers commercially unviable.",1329971833

Also, we've  seen how users reactive negatively to potential privacy issues nowadays [cite various user discontent towards facebook, google plus, and various social networks here].<p>Also, this is not a binary issue, e.g. either disclose the user's full-name or use nothing but pseudonyms.
