I doubt a lot of companies want to hire those people for any price.</i><p>All you are saying here is that the min wage is harmless because it's set below market rates. I.e., it's like setting a $0.25/gallon price floor for petrol, or passing any sort of ""keep doing what you are already doing"" law.<p>But if that is the case, then why would wages decrease if we eliminated the min wage?<p>As for the pent-up demand for $3/hour workers, you can see it every time a company outsources or offshores. My company (located in India) wouldn't exist if we had to pay $7.25/hour, for example. (Of course, market rates for the people we need would probably be higher than $7.25 in the US, so the min wage is a moot point - lowering it would not affect our costs or our hypothetical US employee's wages.)",1330311590

WebSockets are stateful - immediately less scalable and reliable, since a client is tied to a server during the session -, they can't be cached - much less efficient for images, videos, etc -, are tied to particular implementations instead of standards and aren't linkable.<p><i>they just don't add the unnecessary cruft and overhead to get their stellar latency and response times.</i><p>REST doesn't have any ""cruft"". In fact, REST only <i>restricts</i>, it doesn't add anything.<p><i>There will never be an enviable end-user Single Page Application built on a purely REST architecture style since REST/HATEOS promotes the idea of dumb clients driven by a single server view, in a page-by-page mode Netscape 4 would be proud of. This is great if you're building one of the turn-based games of the 90s but the REST of the world has moved - and the talented kids who can cut stellar client side apps aren't doing it with a restricted HATEOS mindset.</i><p>You're mistaken. Nothing about REST or HATEOAS prevents a web application from serving Javascript that then calls a RESTful API dynamically, using PushState to change the current resource URI locally.<p>In fact, pushing and running code on the client (code-on-demand) is one of the constraints (albeit optional) of REST, as specified in Fielding's dissertation. Your claim that REST promotes dumb clients is wrong.<p><i>So while Google makes arguably the best REST client with Chrome, they're not wasting their time trying to restrict their Single Page Apps around HATEOS constraints. Instead they're investing heavily in trying to move the web forward with technologies that actually improve end-user experience like WebSockets and SPDY</i><p>What Google service uses Websockets, exactly?<p>And there's nothing unRESTful about SPDY.
