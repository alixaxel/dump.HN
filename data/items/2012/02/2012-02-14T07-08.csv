3589100,comment,3588942,3588942,9,0,runningdogx,,,"One aspect I've never thought about before is the selection of representatives for parliament/legislature.  In the U.S., they're pre-selected in primary elections per party, but the national elections are single-winner per seat, so the candidates are out pandering to the voters constantly.  I don't know percentages, but many other countries use multi-winner to select their national multi-seat bodies, and my understanding is that those would-be candidates aren't out campaigning, or at least not anywhere close to as visible as they are in the U.S. or the U.K. where there are direct single-winner elections for seats.  As ideologically-driven as political parties are, maybe the parties still tend to select more rational, scientific-minded representatives when the would-be reps do not have a requirement to pander directly to the population prior to the election.<p>India (from wikipedia) also appears to have direct election of its parliament.  India is fairly well known for its stifling bureaucracy.  Is that coincidence, or the start of a pattern?<p>Maybe it's also in part due to other countries (those which aren't degenerate and corrupt enough that the government can fraudulently influence elections) knowing they're not the world's largest superpower, and knowing they can't afford to screw around as much.<p>I'd love to see the voting system changed to Range Voting (best overall?) or Condorcet (best ordering-based voting system?).  For its discrimination against third parties, plurality voting is simply horrible, and IRV is nearly as bad[1].  I'll note that I don't think a voting system change alone will fix the American political system.<p><a href=""http://rangevoting.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rangevoting.org</a>, despite its nominal bias, is the best voting system resource anywhere.<p>[1] for instance: <a href=""http://bolson.org/voting/irv/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bolson.org/voting/irv/</a>  IRV fails monotonicity, which IMO is a huge deal.  <a href=""http://rangevoting.org/Monotone.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rangevoting.org/Monotone.html</a>",1329206378

3589058,comment,3588523,3588836,9,0,marknutter,,,"Having played both, there are some key differences:<p>- American Football allows blocking, whereas rugby does not. This means it's perfectly legal to blindside someone as hard as you can, often helmet to helmet.<p>- Football allows tackling above the waist without wrapping your arms around the other player, whereas rugby does not. This means people can launch themselves at the other player as hard as they want without wrapping up, basically turning themselves into large projectiles. The goal, up until recently (since the league started cracking down), was to have a helmet-to-helmet collision in order to knock the other player out (most often happening to wide-receivers). Knocking out another player is a point of pride and a strategic advantage as well.<p>- Football has armor, Rugby does not. This actually works against Football. It encourages harder hits and head-to-head collisions. Football helmets protect against skull fractures but not concussions. The brain moves independent of the skull in a high impact collision despite how shock absorbant the helmet may be. In rugby, players are a LOT less likely to crack each other's heads together because of the risk of fracture.<p>I played rugby for 7 years through high school and college, and Football 2 years in high school. I never received any concussions in Rugby (let alone any serious injury at all), but did receive them in my short experience playing football, and at the Junior Varsity level no less.<p>If I ever have a son, as much as I love the sport, he is banned from playing American football.",1329205155

""Everything is really complicated, so don't try to predict it or think about it too hard"" isn't a particularly uplifting message, and there's not even much reason to think that it's true. Perhaps it's a mistake to generalise too much from the success of a few companies, but if we're not trying to generalise at all, what hope do we have of improvement?<p>I'd like to quote from a really fantastic book, The Art of Game Design by Jesse Schell, a section called ""Waiting for Mendeleev"":<p><i>Unfortunately, at present, there is no unified theory of game design, no simple formula that shows us how to make good games. So what can we do?</i><p><i>We are in a position something like the ancient alchemists. In the time before Mendeleev discovered the periodic table, showing how all the fundamental elements were interrelated, alchemists relied on a patchwork quilt of rules of thumb about how different chemicals could combine. These were necessarily incomplete, sometimes incorrect, and often semi-mystical, but by using these rules, the alchemists were able to accomplish surprising things, and their pursuit of the truth eventually led to modern chemistry. [...]</i><p><i>I wish we had one all-seeing lens. We dont. So, instead of discarding the many imperfect ones we do have, it is wisest to collect and use as wide a variety of them as possible, for as we will see, game design is more art than science, more like cooking than chemistry, and we must admit the possibility that our Mendeleev will never come.</i>",1329204980

3589032,comment,3588942,3588942,17,0,pranjalv123,,,"I think the really big factor here is that scientists don't want to go into politics! Maybe I'm painting the world with an overly broad brush here, but politics and science approach the truth in exactly opposite ways.<p>I'm not going to say that politics is a game of lies, because it's not, but politicians essentially invent the truth as they go along. It's similar in some ways to law or the humanities, where the truth is very much a matter of interpretation, there's a case to be made for each side, and no one is ever objectively ""wrong"". Right and wrong are entirely a matter of personal opinion.<p>On the other hand, science is, in the limit, entirely objective. A physical theory can be objectively shown to be incorrect. Scientists can defend their theories, but fundamentally have to accept it if their theory is disproved, or else they become irrelevant. There was a great link earlier today on HN that talked about how the smartest people are the ones who are most skeptical of their own ideas. That's great in science, but if you don't believe yourself totally in politics, no one else will.<p>This means that scientists, who presumably study under and work with other scientists for decades, think in this scientific mindset. This makes them totally unsuited for the world of politics (and of course, vice versa). Politicians can't admit they were wrong, because that means that they'll probably be wrong again, and no one will vote for someone who's wrong. Case in point: Mitt Romney and universal healthcare.<p>I'll also make another point that a lot of people miss: Being a politician is roughly as difficult as being a scientist. If we expect our best politicians to get an advanced degree in something like business or law (things related to the process of running a nation) or to spend a long time working in politics or on social issues, why do we think that scientists with no such training will make good politicians? We certainly don't expect most law school grads to do much more than wash bottles in the lab.",1329204401
