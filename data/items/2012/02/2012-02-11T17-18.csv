3579676,comment,3577454,3577454,2,0,_delirium,,,"I find it slightly easier to look at arguments justifying copyright. That's related to arguments opposing piracy, but the latter can be more complex. For example, if you've established (via an argument justifying copyright) that it is ethical and correct for a country to have copyright laws, why it's unethical to pirate then boils down to why it's unethical to violate just laws, which is a whole argument in itself (social-contract arguments, deontological arguments, utilitarian arguments, etc.).<p>That might be too fine a distinction, but in any case, there are two main varieties of arguments justifying copyright (though there are also some others, advanced less often):<p>1. Utilitarian arguments, that copyright improves well-being in some important way. These divide (as I see it) into a more strongly stated utilitarian-ethics approach, and a more weakly stated public-policy approach. The stronger approach argues on utilitarian grounds that it is <i>ethically required</i> to have a copyright system, because of the moral good it produces. The public-policy argument makes the more limited argument that a country adopting a copyright system will improve the country's society, so it ought to do so (but is not necessarily being unethical if it chooses not to).<p>2. Right-of-the-author type arguments that argue for a property or quasi-property interest in ideas, or some ancillary things around ideas. This is somewhat more prevalent in French thinking than Anglo-American thinking, as suggested by the French translation of the word ""copyright"", <i>droit d'auteur</i>. The quasi-copyright category of ""moral rights"" is related to this, and can support some middle-ground positions, such as a belief that copyright itself is <i>not</i> a right, but that being accurately identified as the author of a work <i>is</i> a right (i.e. some kind of anti-intellectual-theft position, where it's ethical to copy a book, but not ethical to copy a book <i>and claim you wrote it</i>).<p>There's an extra level of complexity when you look at contract law, corporate copyright, and transferability. For example, some of the <i>droit d'auteur</i> based approaches consider it an immutable, untransferable right <i>of the original author</i> specifically, who can enter into licensing arrangements for the work, but cannot transfer or sign away their fundamental moral rights.",1328982829

3579664,comment,3579088,3579088,9,0,quatrevingts,,,"From a language design standpoint, Tcl is simple and beautiful.  You can read its entire semantics in its rather short man page.  It's got the homoiconicity of Lisp (with strings instead of lists) which enables very flexible syntax extension.  Its simplicity also allows it to be embedded rather easily.<p>Unfortunately, it's <i>too</i> simple, in one fundamental way which makes the language very flawed:  it does not have closures.  Callbacks (which are fundamental to I/O or GUI work) are executed from a scope which has access to nothing but global variables.  As a result, users of the language must either stash everything in globals, or else perform awkward explicit variable substitution, taking care to distinguish between variables to be evaluated in the present context and variables to be evaluated in the callback context and escape them appropriately (like writing a Lisp macro, but this is in every callback.)<p>And if you want to implement any higher-order functions, say filter by predicate, you have a problem because you want to pass an argument to the predicate, but you also want the predicate to have access to variables in the scope where it was defined.  The predicate is not a first-class function:  it's a block of code that you can eval.  In fact, you can eval it anywhere on the call stack.  That's right:  Tcl gets the job done using functions which evaluate blocks of code in their caller's context.  If that sounds scary, good, it is.",1328982369

3579652,comment,3576598,3578159,2,0,samth,,,"I'll try to separate out the different issues you're raising here, and respond to each individually.<p>1. What if I want to have my module be a function, the way that $ in jQuery is both a function and a namespace for the rest of the functionality?<p>This is an important use case, and so we're going to support it in ES6 modules.  You'll be able to say:<p><pre><code>    module $ at ""http://jquery.com/jquery.min.js"";\n    $(...)\n    $.ajax(...)\n</code></pre>\n2. Modules will requiring using names without the prefix.<p>This isn't true.  As you can see in the above example, you can just use $ directly, even though it's a module.  You can also say:<p><pre><code>   import ajax from $;\n</code></pre>\nbut you don't have to.<p>3. We should just standardize the node module system.<p>Of course, there are many different module systems being used in JS code right now, and we could just pick one.  Unfortunately, we couldn't just pick the node module system, since it's fundamentally synchronous, which is great on the server side but not in the browser.<p>However, we feel that we can bring real advantages to JS programmers by extending the language -- we can simplify using modules, we can make some patterns direct that currently have to be written using callbacks, we can better support encapsulation, and we can allow engines to use knowledge about modules for optimization.<p>3. Static analysis is doable even without a static module system.<p>The static analysis you describe, while useful, isn't going to tell an engine statically where it can go to lookup references to an export from a module.  That means it's not useful for many of the optimizations that we want to enable.  Additionally, your analysis isn't sound -- it can miss uses of `require` that are generated dynamically, for example.  Again, that means that engines can't use it for optimization.<p>Finally, if you have comments about ES development, I strongly encourage you to make them on es-discuss, rather than on HN, where they are more likely to have an impact on the development of the language.",1328981935

3579630,comment,3578823,3579241,1,0,kls,,,"I think there is a contention in what MV* preaches and the reality of UI development now that it is disconnected from the server. Traditional MVC has followed a struts like architecture where the C is a procedural workflow that starts at A and end at Z. This encouraged a dumb V where say the header of a site was an HTML template and that the C would then populate with the M. This benefited the service oriented nature of HTTP request, they are a procedural workflow pattern where the request is initiated and work is done and a response is returned. This worked great for the old way of doing thing, compromises had to be made given that the view was generated and then delivered.<p>Fast forward to today and the UI can now be decoupled from the back-end technology so it is natural to evaluate whether or not the old patterns apply to new practices. In the old model, event based development and widgets had little advantage, event's where overly complex for a service oriented architecture, where a unit of processing is done and then a response is returned. It made little sense to bring in the indirection of event based programming. Further black boxing UI elements into widgets had little advantage because they could not directly respond to events that happen on the client side, in the old way, if a button was clicked, the server had to be notified and it would require complex routing to get that request back to a discreet widget that would have to be recreated or cached and looked up with every request. MVC with procedural C's where the best pattern available to deal with this reality.<p>Now jumping back to the present, we are not under the same constraints, code can be delivered to the client, the client can respond to events and the client can request processing and data from the back end. Based on this reality, procedural C's don't make a lot of sense, rather events and widgets become a more discreet solution. Designed well, a UI can actually rid itself of almost all procedural glue code external to widgets, via event routing and syndication. In this new reality there is little need to have a controller that says you do this and then you do this. Rather you can build widgets that say when this happens I will do this and when that happens I will tell everyone about this.<p>Given the dogmatic view of MVC being a best practice people sometimes try to draw parallels and call what they are doing MVC. A better description of MVC or widgets is separations of concerns which is still valid. You should not have JavaScript in HTML and you should not generate HTML from strings in JavaScript. Rather just like in MVC a widget should have an HTML template that represents the view. Some people call widgets micro-MVC which I suppose is correct, but to my MVC implies a controller orchestration a workflow in which I think we are trying to force definitions to not look like the guy that does not know what he is doing. That being said, I think trying to square peg round hole Event/Widget UI development into a MVC definitions is causing a lot of confusion. I think MVC is a relic of web 1.0 page/post programming. What people are really trying to say when they say MVC on the client, is separation of concerns which is still a very relevant and good practice.",1328981116

It should be written into the digital material we make using hardware we have authorized...We want this because it would simplify problems of attribution and copyright on the Web. If we didn't sign something we created, it would default to the other ways we deal with unsigned content. But content that is signed would have an unmistakable origin.<p>Jon's butthurt that people can copy his bytes, post them somewhere else, and he doesn't get credit for them. That's understandable - content creators should be credited for their creations, after all - but what Jon's talking about -whether he realizes it or not - is DRM for textual web content. Pardon me while I laugh my ass off.<p>The problem is inherently unsolvable. Textual content as it works on the web is literally impossible to protect from copying without attribution without gutting and redesigning the entire internet from the ground up.<p>If you want to tell other people that something you wrote is indeed from you, sign it with your private key and publish your public key for verification. Create as many keys (""identity facets"") as you want. Associate any given key with any given online persona you want. Boom, problem solved with technology that we've had for the last 36 years. Verification of identity is <i>not a difficult problem</i> anymore, chain-of-trust issues notwithstanding.<p>But it doesn't solve the problem that Jon wants solved, which is that I can still take his content, strip the signature, and repost it, and nobody will be able to recognize that that content is his. Just as in the Real World, I can hear someone tell a joke, and then turn around and tell the joke over dinner without attribution to the original author, I can copy a string of bytes on the internet and republish them as my own without including a link back to the author. That's simply the nature of information flow.<p>The problem is unsolvable, and down the path of trying to solve it lies DRM madness. It's a Bad Idea, and it's a little dismaying that a technology writer would even suggest it to begin with.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_is_going_to_mess_up_the_internet.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_is_going_to_mess...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3424457"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3424457</a><p><pre><code>    -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\n    Version: GnuPG v1.4.11 (GNU/Linux)\n\n    iQEcBAEBAgAGBQJPNrVLAAoJENc6Nkx25axIAaAH/RbzNSqtqYQXeTtTdm2FDc2T\n    sIXMOicqP1IL/Ge/FITiKZ4xEh3JhcFTCEApgqSwBCdPEUXxqR2ibM9v/K5T7Y3C\n    N/3IgZnM0t7Sx5o5XEfrQVsuWsjZZo6gk3Ki/u8JliaZl670Ouo8a2NEMi+1hQVJ\n    tnu2y+CUB4bQhSgg6hGoLdkfs+iC0/RBZwrb8LLac4/25I3nOXqLaZKBcUnoqwUR\n    WOFy6+M56nQ4dHIpPflvdEn0J8RO//pE30iqeg9OHOo0L+WoYYHTI+uXrBidBEFI\n    RzDYaTxSC2o4f4QkF778pMR4wwsuySrUHViheG/uwt2woh9n2obXaMc8iwyLRvA=\n    =mL7+\n\n    -----END PGP SIGNATURE-----</code></pre>",1328981083

And are gradually improving with better algorithms and better CPUs. But go is a game with <i>extremely</i> simple rules - simpler than chess - and an inherently simple possibility space - simpler than Jeopardy - so if somebody were to build a program tomorrow that could beat all the world's best go players, wouldn't you then just dismiss this as not demonstrating true intelligence because we'd then know that go has ""very simple rules which allow symbol shifting systems to succeed""?<p>Winning at Jeopardy is far more impressive with regard to demonstrating ""intelligence"" than winning at go would be. Jeopardy questions are limited by the english language and human creativity; the relevant info that could be brought to bear in answering these questions is the entirety of knowledge the humans playing the game might have, including knowledge of puns and wordplay. Whereas the go search space, while quite large, is something any programmer could model - just mappings of one 19x19 three-state grid to another. Go is theoretically <i>solvable</i> in a way that Jeopardy is not.<p>>The human brain has over a septillion atoms<p>If the individual atoms were all individually crucial to producing thought that would be relevant. But it seems rather unlikely that they do. We need to replicate the relevant <i>properties</i> of neurons, not their exact makeup. Suppose you need to replace a broken hipbone or jawbone. There's a whoooole lot of atoms in a piece of bone, but you can replace it with any compound that has suitable physical properties. What matters when replacing bone is characteristics such as strength, flexibility, and wear resistance. Whatever you replace the bone with will also have a lot of atoms, but knowing the exact number of atoms and where they were wasn't necessary to replacing the functionality.",1328981004

This makes them convenient to buy, to carry around and/or read from multiple devices. Sharing is not implied. The fact that it's easy to copy an ebook doesn't make it lawful. There's still a little thing called copyright, granted by governments to encourage the arts and allow artists to be paid for their work. The extent to which an ebook can be copied should be up to the copyright holder. That doesn't mean that ebooks can't be posted publicly or loaned out, either to a friend or by the public library, as asserted in the better reasoned argument by Richard Stallman. <a href=""http://www.teleread.com/copy-right/richard-stallman-on-freedom-or-copyright-why-not-an-information-utopia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teleread.com/copy-right/richard-stallman-on-freed...</a> Stallman, at least, is forthright about his desire to eliminate copyright.

I.e. it forces one to separate out the behavior from the construction and so systems (rather than off-the-cuff demos) are cleaner and easier to read and maintain.",1328979742
3579571,comment,3579088,3579088,32,0,hp,,,"Back in the era this is talking about, I ported the Tk text widget over to GTK+ which became GTK's still-used text widget (GtkTextView).<p>I think the author is right that it was a mistake to ignore Linux. It didn't have the desktop user marketshare, but it did have the developers that were doing a lot of the work on open source code.<p>Even at that time (just before GTK+ 2.0, around 2001), expected toolkit features had jumped ahead of Tk quite a bit; in porting the widget I think I added model-view separation, pixel-based (vs. line-based) scrolling, international text layout, input methods, accessibility, lots of optimizations, support for non-XPM images... likely more I can't remember.<p>Tk lacked all that stuff, and various GTK-related companies and Troll Tech (Qt) were investing in building all of it for GTK and Qt. That led to a situation where only those two toolkits, that had been modernized, were acceptable to lots of decision-makers who were deciding what to ship with Linux distributions or GNOME or KDE. Nobody could afford to go modernize Tk also, it was easier to just get all the apps on one or two toolkits.  The modernization work was being funded or volunteered-for with Linux in mind, nobody cared to do it for open source toolkits on Windows or Mac.\nSwing was probably the only cross-platform toolkit that had the same modernization work done. (Ignoring ""wrapper"" toolkits like wxWindows or SWT that have whatever modernization is found in the toolkit they wrap.)<p>The Tk text widget was a solid piece of work, I mean, it's an accomplishment to write code good enough that it makes sense to port it to another toolkit. The core btree data structure from Tk is in GTK to this day with extensions but no real major overhaul: <a href=""http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtktextbtree.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtktextbtree.c</a>\nI think Ousterhout may have written it.<p>It's an interesting data structure if you like that sort of thing. The older GTK text widget had various operations that were O(n), and so people kept writing O(n^2) or worse code accidentally; with the new one, one of the goals was to try to keep everything below O(n) so it was harder for developers to hose themselves. The core of this was the btree from Tk. One place we declared defeat was in very long lines; some stuff is still O(n) where n is the line length, and that's hard to fix without massive overhaul. The btree is about storing lines and related metadata so that things aren't O(n) in number of lines. There's also a useful trick in <a href=""http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtktextiter.c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/tree/gtk/gtktextiter.c</a> where an incrementing ""change stamp"" is used to keep an iterator valid even though the iterator caches some pointers that can become invalid as the btree changes.<p>Sorry for the ""used to walk both ways in the snow""-flavored post ;-)",1328979739
3579570,comment,3579378,3579378,1,0,benologist,,,"Looks interesting.  There's a bug on the editor though, if I delete or backspace some content it orphans some lines at the bottom of the file.  You can see it very visibly if you scroll right down the bottom and start backspacing, it erases 2 lines above the line you're on.  (Chrome 17 / OS X).<p>Backspace is also one of the handful of reasons why I stopped using Cloud9 after playing with it a bit, if you lose connectivity right as you're pressing backspace it triggers the browser's back.  Make sure the various ways you can leave that tab are protected - notification if you close it, disable back/forward.",1328979696
