It's true that very original thoughts come out once you have the time to establish context, a connection with the audience, etc. And this enables a sort of learning and communication that may be impossible or difficult to transmit via short form content - be it blogging or micro-blogging. That being said, I actually see a ton of insightful, one liner comments on Twitter all the time. And the ratio of time taken vs. learning absorbed is far better than I think a book has ever given me. Maybe in the next 5-10 years books stick around via new e-readers, and one day, a chip in our body that lets us read anything any time but just closing our eyes. They may never totally go away. But just like live theater dominated the sphere of 'entertainment' long ago, it has retreated to a niche, and I think with the rise of short form content, mass video production/distribution, and other media shifts, that is where books are headed, too.",1328856791

Using salts and a slow hash function improves security by requiring custom rainbow tables that take longer to build.<p>3. In a B2C situation, an easy appeal to justice can be made that a business should not be making a concerted effort to break its own customer privacy protection.  This would not look good in court.<p>4. If additional consumer protection laws are needed, one-way hashing for the purpose of privacy could be considered a form of pro-consumer DRM.

I was the sole web developer and basically took idea from conception to launch, for a rather budget rate as I was light on experience at the time, yet would still get all kinds of flack at times, basically I've come to realize that 'business' people often simply don't and won't ever have respect for what developers do. Having worked for a company also that is 'mature', 10 years old, or so, that is run by sales and business people, I can say its the same thing, there is a lack of trust and respect on their part for the engineering team, even though software is their core product and without the developers the company couldn't even exist. Really the only way to get away from this, IMO, is to work for companies that have someone with a dev background at the top, its the only way a company can ever truly ""get it""",1328854594
