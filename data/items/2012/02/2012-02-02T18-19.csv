3543983,comment,3542931,3543901,2,0,jules,,,"If it was a C int then it would just change to another value. If it was a Python int then two things can happen: either the bit flip was in the value which causes the value to change, OR the bit flip was in the tag bits which causes Python to interpret the data as something else than an int. The latter would most likely cause your program to crash.<p>With MySQL any of those things you can happen. If you're lucky then only the cache is corrupted and then you can just reload from disk. If you're unlucky then the data got corrupted on its way to disk and the wrong data will be written to disk. If you are astronomically unlucky then the in memory machine code of MySQL got changed in such a way that it starts overwriting your entire disk with garbage. You should probably be more afraid of meteorites though. And of bugs in either your own or others' code.<p>ECC RAM reduces the probability of such a bit flip happening. That doesn't mean that they are eliminated entirely. So you have to do these two things in any case:<p>1. Bit flips can cause processes to misbehave/crash. So you want to have a way to detect and restart misbehaving/crashed processes.<p>2. Even with ECC RAM you want to do your own error correction for critical data (say a bank transaction log).<p>Here is an interesting paper that discusses the prevalence of DRAM errors and the effectiveness of ECC RAM:<p>DRAM Errors in the Wild: A Large-Scale Field Study -- <a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf</a><p>It would be interesting if somebody did an experiment where they artificially flipped bits of various software's memory to see what happens. I'd expect that in many cases it doesn't do any harm at all.",1328209163

Without \n   getting into the issue of monism and dualism \n   (international legal concepts for how treaties embed \n   themselves into domestic law) it simply means that until \n   signatory states create enforcing legislation, ACTA does \n   nothing.\n   \n   An example would be that, once passed, a US federal act \n   that enforces ACTA is immune from challenges over states \n   rights (though not bill of rights challenges). To be \n   frank this isn't too controversial, there is nothing in \n   ACTA that doesn't satisfy the inter-state commerce \n   clause anyway.\n   \n   So undersand that ACTA isn't really the issue.

There are regulations regarding money laundering that we will have to comply with of course. Users are required to fill out certain forms if the the amount of a transaction exceed 3,000 for individuals and 20,000 for businesses. And these are not just ""per transaction"", it is per month. As with scams our system is specifically designed to prevent users from falling into the trap scam sellers or buyers. Of course it will never be absolutely fool-proof, but it does significantly reduce the incentive for fraudulent activities on both sides.

Reasoning about the things that could happen when memory errors occur is very difficult, because they occur outside the mental model of computation that most programmers (and systems administrators) use.<p>Let's use MySQL as an example. A bit flip in the memory which holds the code may cause it to crash. A bit flip in the 'metadata' could cause the table to become corrupted, potentially recoverably. A bit flip in the data itself could turn 'Travis' into 'Trbvis', which might go undetected depending on where it happened and which storage engine you are using.<p>The use of memory for OS page caching (less so in databases, which often use O_DIRECT and more so in other programs) means that arbitrary corruption could happen to pieces of disk data your program didn't even touch, if you touch data near them.",1328208949

3543877,comment,3542976,3543185,2,0,mekoka,,,"I have an account that I now visit at most once a month. I used to enjoy facebook when it was really about keeping in touch. When I joined in 2007, I really just wanted something to share pictures and stories with family and friends. Then facebook decided it wanted to become the ""operating system of the web"". I think that was the beginning of the end for me. Maybe many people liked this and actually (over)hyped it, but to me it made fb look more like all the previous social networks that I had (successfully) managed to avoid until then.<p>To me, facebook had the responsibility to handle the information you provide with care, but I believe that in their quest to become profitable, they've been quite cavalier with this notion, that is until now that viable alternatives are creeping up. I'm of the opinion that people love to know the truth, but they just don't like the lengthy process it sometimes requires to get at it, so they make judgment calls on the slightest bit of information, whether it's only a <i>version</i> of the truth or a partial truth. Politics is a prime example of a domain where this is usually exploited. I had an early taste of the destructive potential of facebook when I witnessed the scandal that ensued, when an acquaintance was tagged in a ""compromising"" photo. It was an admittedly amusing and entertaining event from my standpoint, but it prompted me to remove some of my personal information and some public pictures and set my email to warn me if someone tagged me in a picture or posted on my wall.<p>Then came facebook-connect, a private alternative to the public and more open OpenID. I know the latter was flawed in many ways. Call me paranoid, but I don't believe facebook was more motivated in unifying the authentication process than it was to <i>know where its users went in the web</i>. fb-connect imo, was an excellent trojan horse on their way to track users' habits across the web, but it wasn't perfect. Most websites still offered an alternative to people who didn't have a facebook account, to sign in with a more traditional sign-on. Also, having implemented fb-connect in the past, I distinctively remember that back then, it required the site's visitor to explicitly authorize this affiliation to take effect. Something that I've always refused to do in my effort to keep what belongs in facebook in facebook.<p>Then one day, after reading an article on techcrunch, I was about to post a comment and I saw the Comments box with my actual fb profile picture and name next to it. A website that I seldom visited, could now know that I was there, just because it was affiliated with facebook and I was still signed on to facebook during my visit. This new widget didn't even bother asking me if I was ok with that. That was when I started actively logging off of my fb (until then, I was just closing the window). Later on, some users started reporting that facebook actually kept tracking cookies across its affiliated sites even if they were logged off facebook. At that point, I started using a different browser just for it.<p>I don't understand people who don't understand why facebook get such a scorn. I like my family and my friends and I like keeping in touch with them. Just because I happen to do it with facebook doesn't mean I have to become a fan by association.",1328207579

3543793,comment,3542507,3543510,8,0,mattmanser,,,"To be completely honest if you were impressed you shouldn't have been. Learn your IDE!<p>Apart from the douchey tone of the article, the thing he misses is that most editors can do this stuff, you've just got to make a bit of an effort to find out how.<p>Emacs/Vim <i>force</i> you to learn this stuff as they suck without it. That's one of the big difference between Vim/Emacs and others, people don't realise they can do so much more with IDEs.<p>For example in VS2010 with the MS productivity tools extension:<p>Example 1: Use ctrl-shift-r/ctrl-shift-p (temp macro), actually less typing than his example due to auto-bracketing. Also learn how to use snippets.<p>Example 2: I'm dubious on the value as believe this would require cognitive effort that I'm using for the code. I suspect hunt-and-peck (and only 4 or 5 keystrokes using ctrl-arrow at that) is probably better than switching mind modes to figure out the best cmd. For example won't handling <i>entry.key().equals(qk.key)</i> instead require different keystrokes, hence thought?<p>Example 3: Use End, Shift-Home or Home, Shift-End instead<p>Example 4: Use home, end, ctrl-pageUp, ctrl-pageDn to mostly deal with this<p>Example 5: VS does this automatically on paste, so no typing at all required. If it really struggles you can use shift-},tab to indent an entire block, assuming starting on the { as the article does.<p>Example 6: VS highlights end tags automatically without you even having to press anything, there's probably a command to select the enclosing block but I've never looked as it happens so quickly I don't think it's worth the time, here I just  End, shift-upArrow a few times or go to the mouse. Deleting a whole block of code generally requires some thought about what it was doing, you're not in edit mode at the point of deletion. If you're looking for multiples then ctrl-F (find) will highlight all instances of the word your cursor is on, this is easier with productivity tools installed as it doesn't open a dialog. And VS also has the excellent rename all instances of this variable only in the right scope.<p>He keeps banging on about fingers staying on the home row, but I don't really notice moving to the arrow keys, perhaps it's cognitively similar to switching to/from insert mode.<p>I had to actually do all of them a few times to be able to write them down as just like Vim/Emacs, that's all muscle memory to me now.<p>NB for example 5/6 I highly recommend changing the default colour of highlighted start/close tags in C#, the gray MS uses is far too light given how important it is. This is pretty much the only colour I have ever bothered changing from default.<p>The other massive productivity thing in all editors if you didn't know it is ctrl-arrow, moves along words instead of single instances. Holding shift works as expected and you can hold shift-ctrl with one little finger. But I'm sure everyone knows that one.<p>In regard to the productivity tools, I would turn off the auto-correct mixed tabs as it moans all the time when you look at downloaded code and also 'Quick Access' too as that's annoying.<p>All that power without months of learning a new way of using a text editor.",1328206092
