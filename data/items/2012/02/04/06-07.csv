On the whole, I'd agree that it's among the best bets for an English speaker interested in learning a non-Indo-European language.",1328338797

3550477,comment,3548445,3549441,4,0,LearnYouALisp,,,"As I read these comments, I was imagining a non-technical supervisor sitting down a programmer on a relatively small project to learn how their work is done, from start to finish. The project should be short enough for the manager or like person to see it completed over a few sessions, including the overview, the draft, and the testing and problem-solving.<p>The programmer would explain the goal of the new project, like so: ""We need to design a module that talks to the what-what the customer is using. It has to do three things: it must take an order from the what-what, then perform the appropriate action, and finally receive information back from the central system.""<p>""So, we begin with the first part of the module: the part that will take an order from the what-what. It needs to listen for a message from the unit the customer is interacting with. Then, it needs a rule concerning what to do with each order, that is, what instructions to follow.""<p>Once the basic form and actions of each section are established, then he or she can explain in more detail the actual working parts: ""Now we need to step through the list of orders. With each order, we will check our rule set and perform the appropriate action. Once there are no more orders, we will tell the computer (or program) we are finished and it can proceed to the next step, which is receiving information back from the central system.""<p>Throughout, the programmer only needs to explain conceptually the work he is doing: Even the difficult or intricate concepts (details of network connections, perhaps) he may illustrate. The details of the actual programming language do not need to be explained for this purpose. (That is, he does not need to say, ""Now we write 'Blob userOrders = new (Blob)' to create a new blob"", or ""We will receive the orders from the customer into an array (""What's that?"") and step through them with a 'for' loop."") He or she might use a pen and paper to draw a diagram of the module as they design it.<p>Once the manager has the overview of the system and knows how it is supposed to work, perhaps they can follow the writing of tests for it: ""We will send it some simple test orders to see if it follows them correctly....And now we will give it an illogical order--did we check for a bad order?""<p>Finally, the manager or supervisor can join the programmer as he or she goes back to the code to identify the source of the trouble. (More details could be added here.)<p>The programmer does not need to oversimplify, but as they go deeper into the project together, the programmer can explain more technical details. Previously, these details would have been distracting, overwhelming, or incomprehensible to the the person they are teaching, but now they enable them and are necessary to see what the program is doing at this level, and why the problem occurred as it did.<p>Could this be a realistic scenario, in certain cases at least?",1328337171

After a year, we're still really happy we went with Closure, but trying to convince most javascript developers outside our team to learn it has an uphill battle. The learning curve is rather steep, there are no tutorials besides Michael Bolin's (excellent) book, and the similarities to java turn some people off.<p>But once you get past all that, you have a powerful library with a good set tools for unit testing and a compiler that does dead code removal, function inlining, optional type checking through JSDoc annotations, etc. Its miles ahead of any pure-javascript solution because compilation is so tightly integrated into the whole development process. And yet you don't have to compile to run the code in development, so debugging is no harder than before.<p>That said, it's worth noting that the closure library is not a framework.

3550441,comment,3549384,3550310,10,0,mishmash,,,">Am I insane for being completely satisfied with $80,000/yr to do really cool multithreaded programming work on some seriously beefy hardware? (Midwest area.)<p>In 10 years of midwest experience, $80k is probably a bit on the low side for systems-level work. Just a few years ago I would see DreamWeaver jockeys pick up full time for ~$50k/\u0010year. One hire did NOT know the difference between HTML and an HTTP server, someone else called me into a <i>training</i> session she was hosting and asked why her form wouldn't work. She had set the form's action param to email:<p><pre><code>  <form action=""mailto:example@domain.com"">\n</code></pre>\nSadly I'm not kidding. :(<p>On the high-side, I've seen C/C++ contractors charge $100-$250/hour, depending wildly on the individual consultants.<p>So I don't think you're crazy for being happy. And great working conditions can have an often immeasurable impact on life. Happiness, is, after all, the end game - and a guaranteed $80k/year might be worth more than an unknown $120k/year for some people.",1328335794

I used to do them in TeX, but after I started doing other things in the editor I switched them for no particular reason outside of consistency. Also, expansions for words like function, holomorphic, 'the following are equivalent', 'if and only if', etc., are problematic to do as TeX macros, because of issues around spacing, and because it's simply more readable.<p>For the others, it is really about the keystrokes -- one has to be able to type really fast to keep up in a lecture or a talk, and then once you've optimized for speed, why not type that quickly all the time?",1328335459
