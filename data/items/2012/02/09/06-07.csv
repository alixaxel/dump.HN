At this point, the context of this war should be noted - it occurred, in part, because of the manner in which World War I ended, an armistice (however imbalanced in its terms), which was certainly a factor in the outbreak of World War II.  It's understandable that the United States wished to avoid a similar situation with Japan.<p>Is this justification for dropping two atomic bombs on a hostile nation?

Try to find some Europeans thinking the bombs were ""needed"". There is also evidence that us leaders knew about it, it was just a showcase, mainly to scare off USSR. Besides, it's of little consequence if Japan was surrendering or not: the war was going on with conventional weapons even in more dire times, including the Normandy invasion, so nothing called at that time to drop atomic bombs on civilians (if anything ever does). Especially considering that Japan was at the time under attack by conventional bombs, tons of them, that had burned most of its cities and killed hundreds of thousands.<p><i>Easier said for Iraq than Afghanistan.
