Quite the contrary, I believe that very few of your worldview values should need to be imposed by force.<p>That's really a change of subject, though.  You said ""take responsibility"".  In our society today, ""take responsibility"" has connotations, mostly legal.  Or the next line of reasoning is if people should ""take responsibility"", then the government should enforce it with laws and police action.<p>Yesterday, a married couple emailed me for advice on a condo that they're looking to purchase where I just bought one.  I don't know them.  I don't owe them anything.  I don't even feel any social pressure since it's a vacation area and I likely will never meet or see them.  However, I took about 30 minutes to write up a lot of details on what I had experienced in my purchase and gave them my best advice I had.<p>What I resent is someone telling me that I had some real ""responsibility"" to do so.  I did it because I'm a friendly person and I wanted to.  Not because I had someone else's tyrannical view of enforced egalitarianism.<p>My reasoning all ties back to Google.  They have a responsibility to their shareholders.  They have a responsibility to keep the contracts that they enter.  Their responsibility to their shareholders might include showing useful dinosaur information in their AdWords to someone researching dinosaurs because they want to look clueful.  They have no moral responsibility to do so.  They have no legal responsibility to do so.<p>That's why I asked you.  What do you mean by ""take responsibility""?",1330178040

3632900,comment,3629803,3631682,10,0,iuguy,,,"Actually the BBC had it's remit massively widened by the last government so that it had to fill sections of DAB, a large amount of Radio channels, Freeview, set up iPlayer and run a whole load of channels that aren't even targeted at the UK (such as BBC Persian), largely to meet the FCO's propaganda needs. Additionally, the dodgy dossier episode has emasculated and distorted large chunks of the BBC's programming leading to some completely bizarre side effects[1].<p>The BBC still does produce a large amount of quality progamming, but budgets and purposes have been affected. Top Gear for example used to be about cars but is now an entertainment show - a wildly successful entertainment show, but no longer something you'd seriously watch to get an idea of what cars to buy and what to avoid. The BBC is also responsible for the One Show, which one day will be recognised by the UN as a crime against humanity. There's also been considerable dumbing down of shows like the Apprentice and Dragon's Den over time, eschewing quality in favour of personalities and entertainment. The natural history unit still put out good documentaries, but even they're not entirely untarnished[2].<p>The quality of news has also suffered, particularly thanks to spin doctors in previous administrations, the simon gilligan dodgy dossier affair and other stresses on the BBC. When was the last time you saw a proper debate? The other week I saw Alastair Campbell jogging around forests, talking up the end of civilisation through alcoholic poisoning brought on by drinking at home, demanding minimum pricing as the only way out but completely ignoring the impact of the smoking ban as a factor in home drinking increases. It was a terrible attempt at a documentary and a case study in what's wrong with the BBC at the moment.<p>I do apologise for getting on my soap box about this, you didn't deserve it for pointing out the good stuff. Still, the BBC is not a perfect organisation and the amount of media it has to produce combined with political interference has meant that quality has dropped, perhaps not as much considering the volume of material it puts out, but it isn't immune.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/today-programme-the-ladykillers-graham-linehan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/jun/08/today-pr...</a><p>[2] - <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8950070/Frozen-Planet-BBC-faked-polar-bear-birth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8950070/Fr...</a>",1330177780

I largely stopped bothering with TV schedules; I just watch the programs at my convenience, from a menu of content - it's a far superior user experience in almost every way. In browsing UK profiles on dating sites, I've noted <i>huge</i> numbers of people saying they don't have TVs and just use iPlayer.<p>When I was young I used to react with incredulity to the idea that homes didn't have TVs and cars in the past. I remember the incredulity to which some children reacted when I took a photo on my film SLR and they couldn't see it on the back. Landline phones are already dying - children will react with horror that we used to ring a building and hope a person was in it.<p>And, within the next ten years, scheduled network broadcast TV will, to all intents and purposes, die. Rolling news and live sports have a reason to be live and I suspect will stay. Otherwise, I expect in 20 years time to be getting baffled looks from children to the idea that we used to have to wait to all watch a program at the exact same time and if we couldn't see it then we didn't see it.

3632875,comment,3632224,3632511,2,0,einhverfr,,,"@sliverstorm:<p>I am not convinced that biochemistry determines behavior differences as much as many biologists would like to think.  There are cases where it does, of course, but on the whole our bodies are organic systems which learn behaviors based on external stimuli.  One important source of that stimuli is culture, which also includes things like language.  Physical environment provides another set of stimuli.  And just because one thing seems more natural doesn't preclude other societies from doing things differently.<p>For example Arnold van Gennep, the early Dutch anthropologist, spent a fair  bit of space talking about the Todas in India which until reasonably recently practised polyandry.  When you start looking at how polyandry was implemented in their culture, you can see clearly what problems they had to solve, and hence why polyandry is generally far more rare than polygyny.<p>For example, if a woman has multiple husbands, then there is a question as to who is the socially recognized father.  The Todas handled this through a series of rituals where the woman could select one of her husbands as the father of her children (regardless of having sexual relations with other of her husbands), and could re-assign that role going forward (i.e. for children born after the ritual, which she could only do while pregnant) if she so chose.<p>Our biological systems are largely secondary to social inputs, I think.  There are imperatives and some of those have biological origins.  However, it's way too easy to assign too much responsibility to biology and too little to culture.",1330176363

I used to think that if you were bad at the first, then the second would be an even tougher challenge. But I'm starting to suspect that actually people who are good at the first often just don't care about the second. And in fact it might be the very need for things to 'make sense' to you on a deeper level that is causing discomfort and difficulty at the superficial level. Some people lack curiosity about the deeper relationships, and perversely this might actually help them get along at the superficial level.<p>For instance in finance, why is Macaulay duration(1) approximately equal to effective duration? One measures time in years, the other measures sensitivity in percentage form. How the heck do they come out at the same number approximately?

I don't think anyone has suggested that Apple was trying to do anything other than make it easy for you to acquire GPS lock by saving your location information, and the long backup history was an oversight.

The Argentine military proved incapable of surviving the negative aftershocks of a then broken policy of defending the peso at all costs. Since then, the military’s annual budget sank becoming a fraction of what it was in the past. Salaries were cut throughout the ranks. The size of the armed forces not only had to be reduced, but in many cases equipment had to be sold on the black market in order for military units to meet their daily expenses. According to Military Technology, the current strength of the Argentine military is about 68,000 troops.""<p><a href=""http://www.coha.org/honor-shame-and-duty-the-reality-of-argentina’s-tattered-armed-forces-today/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coha.org/honor-shame-and-duty-the-reality-of-arge...</a>",1330175419
