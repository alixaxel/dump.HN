3611122,comment,3610844,3610844,13,0,einhverfr,,,"The article is, IMO, total crap.<p>There are advantages to NoSQL in some cases.  I am even happy to write about them.  However, they are not really the advantages listed here.<p>The first is that SQL databases can in fact be distributed in some cases.  Look at Postgres-XC for an example of write-scalable distributed shards while maintaining a consistent, relational model.<p>The second is the focus on analytics.  NoSQL analytics is very much of a problematic area.  Doing the analysis typically requires very intensive searches of the entire data, and NoSQL databases are not optimized for this.  Consequently analytical data tends to be slow to build and then maintained on data input, rather than generated ad hoc from existing data (using the entered data as a single point of truth).  This leads to a lack of flexibility even though prepared reports load quickly.  It isn't clear to me how different this would be from summary tables maintained with triggers.<p>Now NoSQL has some advantages:<p>1)  Where you don't need ad hoc analytics, where you have highly defined functional requirements, and where you have well defined network protocols for interop, development is often faster, and performance is better.<p>2)  I think it could be very interesting as a network transparent back-plane if you will for various kinds of network services.",1329705858

3611109,comment,3609880,3611025,1,0,rdl,,,"What I've seen (and really like) is doing a great High Deductible Health Plan (i.e. HSA-eligible) -- something where you get top quality coverage for extreme things, and get access to the best doctors, and negotiated prices for everything from the first dollar each year, but are on the hook for the first $5k or so of costs.<p>Then, your employer gives you $5k/yr tax-free into your HSA account; if you don't use it, it's basically equivalent to a Roth IRA.  It's actually better to spend cash out of pocket and then leave the full amount in the HSA, since it can be invested tax-free forever, and all gains are themselves tax-free.  You can easily end up with a few hundred thousand dollars extra.<p>This accomplishes the useful goal of getting people to be price conscious for their medical services, but doesn't impoverish them.  The one thing it might do is promote time shifting expenses (if I know I'm over the $5k limit in one year, I'll get all my other elective stuff done that year), but it's not a big deal otherwise.<p>IMO, the HSA thing was one of the best reforms in health care in a long time, and one of the (few) good things GWB did.",1329705471

What would happen if every police incident was investigated to find out if the powerful were granted special treatment?  If every claim made in a city council meeting was verified?  If every motive behind every vote was examined?  How about tracing down budget expenditures to see who was scheming to defraud taxpayers?  Would the city's citizens care enough to even read the blog?  Would this transparency change government for the better?  It certainly would give Americans a baseline for the level of corruption and inefficiency in local governments.",1329704915

I've toyed with both Common Lisp and Scheme and while I love Scheme for its simplicity and minimalism (at the core, anyway), in my mind they're both really quite different from what Clojure provides. Common Lisp seemed much too clunky and patched together to me, compared to how Clojure is designed to cleanly sit on top of its sequence abstraction, Clojure's notion of time and concurrency and even just how Clojure eliminates the need for some of the parentheses that are required in CL.<p>I'm sure its a matter of taste (and I actually do quite like Scheme, I guess just not enough to try and make it work for me right now...).<p>Having said that and ignoring Clojure, I also appreciate languages with a little more syntax sometimes, so I guess that's also held me back a bit.

3611066,comment,3610309,3610890,14,0,simplefish,,,"It's worth noting that the UK, France, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and almost every other western democracy finance very large chunks of their governmental expenditures via high consumption taxes.  Most people agree that not only are they <i>not</i> hellholes with the poor and middle class starving on the streets, but they're actually nicer places to be poor than the US.  So while you're right that this would be a shift to a less progressive tax system, it's also clear that this isn't the whole story.<p>In fact, the progessivity of the tax system has very little impact on inequality.  You can have a highly progressive system (like the US, which by some measures has the most progressive tax system of any first world country), or a relatively regressive system like most of Europe, and it just doesn't matter.  In which case, anything to simplify the tax system in the US is probably a good idea.<p>Further, the ""rich"" in your example are able to easily evade most taxes.  Consumption taxes - specifically if implemented as a VAT, as in Europe - are effectively impossible to dodge, even if you're very rich.  You may not pay a lot as a percentage of your total income, but you will pay.  The (nominally) highly progressive system in the US is unable to guarantee that.<p>(And in any case, as recursive pointed out, the prebate check would make the system arbitrarily progressive, undermining your entire complaint.  Although personally, I'd favour just implementing a straight up European-style regressive VAT, and if you want to redistribute income, do it via welfare payments; that's what they're there for.  And unlike tinkering with the tax code, they actually are <i>capable</i> of effecting significant redistribution.  Your entire argument seems predicated on the idea that the US tax code has something to offer that the typical European tax code does not.  Will all due respect, I question this.  The US tax code is a disaster, and US prosperity has been achieved in spite of it, not because of it.)",1329704014
3611065,comment,3610332,3610332,14,0,rvirding,,,"There are a number of reasons why I did this:<p>1. I want to experiment with implementing an imperative language with mutable global state on top of Erlang. A goal was to do it in straight Erlang without extensions.<p>2. I am giving a talk on implementing DSL's on Erlang at the next Erlang Factory in San Francisco in March, <a href=""http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2012"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang-factory.com/conference/SFBay2012</a> (be there, it's going to be good, the whole factory I mean), and I wanted to be able to give practical experience from implementing a real-life imperative mutable data language. Lua is a nice, small, relatively clean language and is a good choice for this. And it is actually in use. I was also considering PHP or Javascript but they are definitely not small and clean.<p>3. Lua is an interseting language in its own right and has some cool ideas. You can get quite far with a few simple primitives. I don't know if these would be transferable to Erlang.<p>4. I like implementing languages.<p>While erlua is definitely interesting it is ""just"" an Erlang interface to a standard Lua system and not what I was after. I know that this idea is being used in some commercial systems so it is definitely a viable option.<p>Whether this is of any practical use I don't know. For doing large amounts of Lua execution then a solution like erlua is probably better as the straight lua implementation is faster than luerl can ever be; doing mutable data in an immutable environment is not free. However, the interface between Erlang and Lua in luerl is definitely faster so for smaller amounts of work it may be better. There is also the benefit of while there are many languages there is only one system running them. Could lead to easier maintenance.<p>This only a first version and there is much still to do. I am experimenting with different ways of implementing Lua's mutable data and I am looking at compiling the Lua code down to native Erlang machine code; the current version is an interpreter. There are also some language features left to implement. More libraries would help.<p>That is the status as it stands. My goal is to have a system where people could take their Lua code and just run it in luerl.",1329704010
