3611033,comment,3609485,3609666,2,0,einhverfr,,,"I thought the following quote from the article made me think back to a rich history:<p><i>""For many Americans, modern medical advances have made death seem more like an option than an obligation.""</i><p>In 1912, F. M. Cornford wrote that the Greeks had a view of fate where life was circumscribed by limits both in length and law, and and where when one stepped outside these limits, the debt of life is repaid in death.<p>One of the interesting elements of my study of Norse myth is that the exact same pattern shows up there (although the last time I tried to fully expound that it took me 10 pages!).  The overall structure seems to be that the foundation of life is a primal lot or layer which is bound by law, and incurs a debt (Old Norse 'skuld,' the name of the third Norn means 'debt') and given back at the end of life.  The idea that death repays the debt that was loaned as life is a very interesting one, and it gives a sense of an obligation not only to live well but also to die well as well.",1329703171

3611025,comment,3609880,3610594,1,0,mgkimsal,,,"Agreed, mostly.  We don't use car insurance the same way as health insurance, demanding $5 ""co pays"" for oil changes and tire rebalancing - you just pay for the services you need.  For 'catastrophic' car stuff - body work after accidents, etc - yes, you have auto insurance to help cover those major expenses.  Since we've had so many layers between medical users and providers over the decades, there's very little in the way of 'market forces' at work.<p>My own health (and that of my wife) isn't perfect, but it's reasonably good enough that we can afford our own private health policy, but only reasonably as a high-deductible variant of $5k or so.  And... while it's not great to have to deal with large bills now and then, it's still doable.<p>We had $3300 in premiums last year, and $4300 in out of pocket expenses (roughly).  That's $7600 - divided by 12 is $633/month.  But we only had $3300 in premiums the year before - $280/month.  That's the nature of insurance - we take some risk.  Not everyone can do it, of course, but I have friends who are chained to jobs partially (mostly) because of employer-provided healthcare.  For a family of 5, high-deductible insurance may be something like $600/month, with a potential extra $5k+ out of pocket, but that's a risk.  Instead, they're usually paying more than that in premiums (either they are or the employer is sharing it), so that money's getting definitely being spent either way, instead of only <i>potentially</i> being spent.<p>What might be interesting is to get employers to start offering high-deductible plans, but putting x% extra in to a pool, then sharing a portion of that as a bonus each year to employees who don't use it, but it's there to help if employees need to access it - perhaps something like 50% of your out of pocket deductible could be paid by the company.<p>But... that's just really confusing over time, imo.  Just make it easier for people to buy insurance in the open market - get away from employer-sponsored health insurance.  We've moved away from employer-provided retirement packages - make the same move on health insurance.",1329702794

3611023,comment,3609948,3609948,7,0,markjaquith,,,"Mark Jaquith here. Happy to clear some things up (and would appreciate it if you could make this comment visible on the thread).<p>Here is the text of my tweet:<p>> Imagine if men talked like women with ""Golden Uterus Complex"" do ""Excuse me, but which one of us has a penis? That's what I thought.""<p>First, the definition of ""golden uterus complex"". This phrase was brought to my attention by Dr. Tara J. Palmatier, a doctor of Clinical Psychology. Dr. Palmatier assigns a great many attributes to this personality, but the one most related to my point is:<p>> the golden uterus believes that having birthed a child makes them better and more knowledgeable than others; e.g., the Well you dont have kids so how would you know anything? woman<p>This phrase doesn't apply to ""women"". I wasn't making any kind of blanket statement about women. I wasn't even making a blanket statement about mothers. I was referring to women who have carried a pregnancy to term <i></i>and who exhibit specific behavior characteristics<i></i>. I sure hope that <i></i>how people behave<i></i> is an aspect upon which they can be judged.<p>Here's the specific thing that triggered my tweet: <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/GxYf8.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/GxYf8.png</a><p>For context, it is a picture on Facebook of a mother feeding her newborn baby solid food  a seriously dangerous, ignorant, and irresponsible thing to do. Someone in the comments tells her that you shouldn't feed a baby that little solid food. The mother responds ""Well it my kid not Yours so what I do with him is none of your concern thanks"" [sic].<p>It didn't matter to her that the commentator was correct, and that what she was doing was potentially lethal to her baby. She gave birth to the baby, so in her mind she's the expert and the ultimate arbiter of what is right for the baby. I've even seen this complex be applied to matters other than child care, as if the act of giving birth confers all manner of sagacious powers.<p>I'm not discounting the power of personal experience. I was present for the births of both of my children, and even as a mostly-spectator, it was a unimaginably transforming experience. What I am objecting to is the idea that childbirth automatically makes a woman the ultimate authority on child care or anything else. This is the sort of attitude that has contributed to the anti-vaccine nonsense that has been plaguing some Western countries in recent years.<p>My tweet contrasted the way that mothers with this behavioral complex openly talk about the utilization of their reproductive organs for childbirth being the source of their claimed superiority, and I pondered what it would be like if men claimed and talked about their reproductive organs as the source of their supposed superiority. It was a reductio ad absurdum, clearly. Men (well, most men post high school) don't bring up the use of their sex organs in polite conversation as a trump card. Some (nota bene: <i></i>SOME<i></i>) women do. Sexist men usually exhibit a sexism that is much more closely tied to feelings of mental superiority and greater physical strength. I find it to be an interesting social sexual difference to how some women express a sense of superiority over men.<p>People do reductio ad absurdum comparisons about social sexual imbalances all the time. Like how it's weird to imagine women yelling things out of a car at an attractive male jogger. Or making a joke about how if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament in most religions. I guess I made the assumption that my Twitter audience would get that (a) I was proposing a ridiculous scenario, partly for comedic effect and (b) that I also did it to provoke thought about quirky social sexual imbalances. Maybe that was too much to assume for such a constricting medium such as Twitter.<p>But in any case, my intention and meaning could have been discovered by Ms. Nabors by either asking me for clarification, or doing a simple web search for the phrase, either of which would have immediately made it clear that the phrase refers to a <i></i>behavior<i></i> exhibited by a subset of the subset of women who have given birth, and it is not in any way a slur against women or mothers (I will grant that it is a slur against people <i></i>who exhibit this behavior<i></i>, behavior being an acceptable thing to criticize).<p>Instead of seeking out my meaning, Ms. Nabors quite publicly called me an ""ass"", accused me of making ""sweeping and dismissive generalizations"" about women, implied that I was socially inept (while also making her own sweeping generalization about the social skills of developers), called me openly hostile to women, and called my remarks a symptom of a boys-club attitude within the developer community.<p>I'll leave it to you to decide whether she fairly judged my actions.",1329702769

The ""hello-world"" microbenchmark tells you something about the core stack performance of the frameworks relative to one another. This tends to be surprisingly indicative of the relative real-world throughput per node that you may expect for a more complex application.<p>I.e. Rails (ruby) scores 4 times lower than Python in that micro-benchmark. This is pretty close to the difference that I've observed between real applications on the respective platforms. If anything you'll see the difference magnified in a complex application, but it's unlikely to turn around.<p>Whether that matters or not in the big picture is a different question (it usually doesn't).",1329700941

A random sampling:<p>- Relational databases were designed for a world where availability is unimportant, like transaction processing. Um, no. OLTP has four letters, not two, and the first are as important as the last. Tandem was providing five-9's systems in the '80s and '90s for ATM networks, lottery systems, airline reservations, credit cards, etc. Tandem is a fault-tolerant relational database in <i>hardware</i>.<p>- Up-front schema design is a poor fit in a world where data requirements are fluid: I don't think ""up front"" means what you think it means.  You can change schemas on the fly nowadays; your schema design is no more up-front than your coding is.<p>- You can't have millions of columns in a relational database: True, and you wouldn't; you'd normalize that. This is an important difference, but not a disadvantage of relational databases, any more than saying ""In a relational database, you'd join URLs with IP addresses, and maybe five other tables; this design isn't even conceivable in a NoSQL database.""<p>- To optimize relational performance, you ""do away with joins wherever possible"": 1995 called, and it wants its MyISAM back.<p>- Two-phase commit is so obsolete, even banks don't use it: Of course they do. You still need a two-phase commit to make sure the other end got your data; whether ""got your data"" happens in the customer path or during reconciliation is a design decision. How, exactly, do you think they <i>discover</i> that you and your spouse both got the money?<p>- ""relational databases were developed when distributed systems were rare and exotic at best."" That's nothing; when Von Neumann machines were developed, we didn't even have transistors. Some legacy architectures keep on working.<p>- ""absolute consistency isn't a hard requirement for banks"": see above. Yes it is.<p>- ""So the CAP theorem is historically irrelevant to relational databases: they're good at providing consistency, and they have been adapted to provide high availability with some success, but they are hard to partition without extreme effort or extreme cost."" ... Wh... Bu... That's not even wrong.<p>- ""consistency requirements of many social applications are very soft."" I like the Facebook example from a recent article on causal consistency: I de-friend my boss and then post that I'm quitting. Certain kinds of consistency are in fact critical to social applications.<p>There are many good reasons to design around a NoSQL database instead of a relational one.

Further we cannot rule out the existence of a higher natural order in which there is further purpose. That being said, meaning, point and the eventual lack of both have little to do with the reality that this nature will end, until it does end. Even if purpose is absolutely temporal it is significant in that temporal space, which is enough to give it a point. Acknowledging that a temporal space will end, does nothing to minimize the point of that temporal space and the actors within it. Rather it is a realization that it is a self contained system and that the point or meaning exists within that system, the value is within the system not external to it.
