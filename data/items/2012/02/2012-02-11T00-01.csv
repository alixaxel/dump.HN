3578190,comment,3575281,3575584,2,0,dkarl,,,"I don't think it's okay to hate on skeuomorphs in shipping products, as the author does here.  It's a designer-centric rather than user-centric way of looking at things, and it's bad news for users when value judgments that aren't derived from the user experience are allowed to affect real products.  Going by his definition of skeuomorphs, a drop-down menu is not a skeuomorph.  A spinner (like the ones used in the iPhone to set a timer or an alarm) is a skeuomorph.  That distinction has nothing whatsoever to do with which one is more usable in a given context.<p>Design space is dizzyingly unconstrained, and finding an optimal design is an intractable problem.  A skeuomorph (sticking to the definition in play here) has taken its initial design from a particular source, a physical object.  Odds are that the optimal design does not resemble that physical object.  So what?  Physical objects are a legitimate source of design ideas.  Starting with a highly optimized solution to a similar, more tightly constrained problem is a common and effective pattern for generating good solutions to an intractable problem.<p>Another way of saying ""hating on skeuomorphs"" is ""stigmatizing skeuomorphs,"" and the likely outcome of that is that designers, mindful of their professional image, will tend to eschew skeuomorphs in favor of inferior non-skeuomorphic designs until the winds shift back.  (Isn't that the point of hating on skeuomorphs?  To influence which designs are perceived as good or bad?)  All that means to users is that they will be forced to use inferior designs because of a point of fashion they aren't even aware of.  Another way of saying it is that analyzing whether a design is a skeuomorph or not is like analyzing a musician's influences:  it might give you a clue to whether the creator keeps up with current trends, but it won't tell you anything about whether the product is good or not.<p>Sure, it's legitimate to say that other sources of inspiration should be mined as well.  Constraining a problem to non-skeuomorphic solutions is a legitimate creative exercise, just like constraining the problem in any other way.  It's a creative exercise, though.  It isn't a legitimate rule of thumb for designing products any more than ""use skeuomorphs!"" is a good rule of thumb.  Blindly changing features to make them less skeuomorphic is likely to make the product worse, not better.  How to implement features in a shipping product such as Google Calendar should be based on usability, not whether you think the designer's thought process reflects a certain heuristic, overdependence on which has historically inhibited the emergence of new and better designs.  Research efforts should be criticized on that basis, not shipping products.",1328921922

3578175,comment,3568393,3570057,2,0,xp84,,,"The real problem is that piracy is an attack on our capitalist society's framework for handling a new type of good--a non-scarce good. Copies of data are not scarce, yet society has decided to declare them to be scarce, by law, on pain of jail time.<p>Declaring copies of data to be scarce is a convenient convention (for capitalists), because it allows data itself to be sold exactly like the scarce vessels (records, cassettes, books) which used to be sold as a stand-in for the data itself, and like other scarce things (bread, oil).<p>Without scarcity, capitalism cannot function. You cannot sell air (yet, but see ""Spaceballs"") because there is air all around so you can't run out of it. You can't sell ""fours"" because you can create as many fours as you need with a pen and paper or keyboard. However, the capitalists have successfully legislated that certain sequences of data are scarce.  If this fictional scarcity of data collapses many people would be unable to make money selling non-scarce ""virtual"" things like ideas and data, and would have to fall back to selling real things. And they'd be unable to ""allocate"" these goods to people because everybody could just have whatever they wanted. Very good for people, very bad for capitalists.<p>Much like the attempt to legislate Pi (a half-true half-myth btw), this 'fiat scarcity' (just coined that) is doomed to ultimate failure.

Sure, it looks nice, but it functions awfully.<p>Compare its homepage with the Hacker News homepage: HN won't be featured on any galleries any time soon, but what makes it successful is that it is really well designed. It has a clear brand identity, and the homepage is incredibly functional; you can easily scan the top news, and see what's new. Visited links are grayed out, and the only text that pops is the new headlines. Everything else is secondary, and therefore scaled down and/or grayed out.<p>Inbound, on the other hand, gets it all wrong. You'd think it's a well designed siteit has pretty colors, pretty fonts, pretty patterns. But that just makes it a pretty site, not a well-designed one. You can only see 10 headlines on a page above the fold, and even so it feels more cluttered than HN's 30 article homepage. Extra attention is called on irrelevant information like the rank number, or the author and his mugshot. The end result is a homepage that feels cluttered and has no clear sense of hierarchy.<p>This is what gives designers a bad name. This is also why, if you're building a product, you want to hire a real designer with an education and an understanding for the basics, not just somebody who got good at making shiny things by following photoshop tutorials.",1328921234
3578159,comment,3576598,3576598,4,0,substack,,,"I really dislike what they're doing with modules because it's such a step back from the commonjs-inspired require() that node uses. In node, require() just returns a value. That value is usually an object but often it's just a function. Why should a module that encapsulates exactly one function return anything else but that one function?<p>In ES.next, you've got to use pythonesque `import y from Bar` statements which introduce a frustrating correspondence between the lexicals of your own program and the export names of the module you're trying to use which is really terrible if you're using as many modules as I typically do. I presume ES.next will invent even more specific syntax for some sort of `as` like keyword to side-step this but it seems so unnecessary when javascript already has a module system that is so very good as is exploding in popularity and use (>7000 modules now on <a href=""http://search.npmjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.npmjs.org/</a>).<p>I understand what they're trying to do with static analysis too but you can already pretty much do that and I've done it.

We all know that the normal process is to implement first and then standardize.  That's what Mozilla has done in the past with features like Geolocation and WebGL, and it's what we're doing today with new work like Audio Data, Game Pad, and Telephony.  In fact, the W3C process <i>requires</i> two interoperable implementations <i>before</i> a specification can reach the Recommendation stage.<p>But there's a difference between a standard that is developed in the open, with the opportunity for all parties to provide feedback and influence development, and one that is developed and implemented in secret, and then deployed to production browsers and evangelized to content authors before anyone else has a chance to comment on it -- or even on whether the fundamental approach is a good idea.  (And obviously these are two extreme ends of a spectrum, with a lot of gray area between them.)<p>The problem with many of Apple's ""contributions"" (and some of Google's) is that they never write specs for them or bring them to standards bodies.  (This is the case for Aplle's -webkit-text-size-adjust.)  In some cases they actively fight efforts to standardize them.  (This is the case with Apple's touch events.)  Or sometimes they do push specs to standards bodies, but only after a highly complex specification has been fully developed behind closed doors.  (Google's Dart, NaCL, and Pepper have this problem to some extent.)<p>That's fine if what they really want is a proprietary ecosystem that works in their own browsers.  But if they actually <i>want</i> these efforts to be part of the web, and if they want to be seen as stewards of an open web, then just implementing something is not enough.  The web has lots of stakeholders, and the initial implementer needs to find a way to bring them to the table.",1328919168

To render one on-screen frame of a game running at 60FPS you have 16.6ms to render the frame. This is a difference of about 2^20, or twenty doublings in speed.<p>Assuming CPU power can be doubled every 18 months, which still seems to be the case even if the power of individual cores is not increasing as quickly as it used to be, then you're looking at 18 times 20 months, or 360 months. This is fifteen years.<p>It's also the case that today's systems have a lot more than one CPU. If you take a consumer system that already has four cores and a GPU to boost performance even further, that could shave two to five years off the time.",1328918642

3578063,comment,3577111,3578051,2,0,akeefer,,,"Sure, but that's not what I was arguing against; my point is that just because that's how market works it doesn't mean you can't say there's not a ""shortage"" of some skill.  If the only companies that can hire engineers have to be able to pay them $600k a year, wouldn't you reasonably say that there's a shortage of engineers?  I sure would.  If supply was so large that great engineers were working for $40k per year, wouldn't you suggest that there was a glut/oversupply of engineers?<p>In either case, saying there's a ""shortage"" or a ""glut"" isn't saying anything about supply and demand, it's implying some sort of course of action that you should take:  i.e. go study engineering (yourself) or promote engineering schools (as a society), or go study something else/promote other types of skills.<p>I'm not arguing over market economics, I'm arguing that just because supply and demand work like that it doesn't mean you can just dismiss anyone who talks of there being a ""shortage.""",1328918525
