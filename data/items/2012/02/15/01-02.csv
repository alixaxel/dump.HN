I fully expect my newly-acquired ""skill"" to become obsolete within about a year.<p>This is not fundamental problem-solving.  Hell, I would say that the over-reliance on ""frameworks"" and ""web-applications"" to build all modern software on the ""thin client"" paradigm is itself a <i>fundamental problem</i> that requires more serious thought and problem-solving than most people seem willing to put in.<p>Hypothesis: Despite the high cost of doing so, backwards compatibility must sometimes be broken.",1329271100

I picked my wife up at 9:30 on the day before Christmas eve as she had no choice but to finish her work (she works for a law firm and the deadlines if not met can cause a multi-million dollar case to be thrown out). Even though I know it was necessary for her job, I can't agree with employers doing this. The lawyers make 6 figures minimum (her lawyer is a senior partner and gets a share of the company profits so well above 1 mil a year). Yet my wife makes $35,000 and has to bust her ass yet they can't afford to hire anyone else so their workers aren't constantly running on deadlines.<p>At least my wife's lawyer will not allow her (no arguing) to get paid overtime pay. If she works late, she gets the time off. Some of her coworkers have been paid almost double their wage in overtime pay because the company won't hire them more workers. This is illogical to me.

3592635,comment,3591243,3591243,14,0,jgw,,,"I think this is the natural result of ""programming"" or ""IT"" being perceived as a comparatively lucrative career.<p>I believe it happened in North America, too, just not quite to the same degree.<p>I first had access to a computer (an Osborne 1) in 1983, at the age of 8.  I think it was inevitable from that point that I'd become an electrical engineer or computer scientist.  As luck would have it, it turned out to be a reasonably lucrative career choice, but monetary considerations literally never figured into my choice of university program.  I had no idea how much an engineer made. I think that most of my contemporaries were similarly-minded.  Entering University in 1993, I had never had an email address, and it wasn't until second year that I first saw NCSA Mosaic and this thing walled the World Wide Web.<p>While I was in university, a revolution quietly, but incredibly rapidly, took place.  By the time I graduated in 1998, I was using the web to book travel, buy stuff in online auctions, and my mum was handy at email and finding things on the web.<p>In my department, a huge shift took place in the incoming demographics - the new frosh were there because Computer Engineering was the hot program to be in.  The Faculty halved the Electrical class and doubled the Comp class, and it was noticeable, even years later, when this younger blood graduated and was now in the industry, that many were of a very different mindset to my peers.  Far fewer had followed a genuine passion and fascination with computers, and had pursued it for what seemed to be far more pragmatic and material reasons.  As one acolyte put it, to my barely-contained amusement, ""I'm in software engineering!  Bling Bling!""<p>I mean no disrespect to younger generations.  I recognize that there are many fine folks here much younger than those I describe who are as passionate about computer science and engineering as I am, if not more.  And there are some gray beards laughing at this young fool who thinks he was the last of a pure breed.  But to me that brief period represented a very sudden and very sharp switch in the mentality of those entering the field.<p>Now take that sudden demographic change, time-shift it a few years to where the global network infrastructure is in place to enable this work to be outsourced just about anywhere, and scale it appropriately considering that this lucrative new field could mean the difference between fabulous (comparative) wealth and a life of poverty.  Add an economic crunch that pushed companies to reduce costs, and government initiatives to promote that industry.<p>That's what India's IT industry has developed - a massive work force that has been suddenly conjured into being and drawing an even lower common denominator than I ever saw at school.<p>[EDIT: disclaimer- I also mean no disrespect to many very fine Indian engineers and computer scientists; I mean only that the low-end of the spectrum has lowered dramatically]",1329270427

This is what the concept of 'effect size' (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size</a>) was developed for, quantifying how big a divergence we're talking about. I didn't calculate it here because I literally just starting using R a few days ago and I don't know how.<p>A quick and dirty way is to look at the difference in the 2 means and compare it to what is the 'normal range' (intuitively something like a standard deviation or two), which in this case, my ZQ ranges normally from the mid-80s to the very low 100s (a range of ~20 points), and the difference in ZQ means is 4 points. So that's 1/5 the normal variability - that's nothing to sneeze at! (By a strange coincidence, this is almost the same sort of numbers as for grades in class, so we could analogize: not taking vitamin D at night would improve my sleep grades by one letter. When I was in school, I would not have turned my nose up at such an intervention.)<p>So, your comment is wrong as stated, I think. But as it happens, I <i>do</i> have something which could serve as your 'positive control': my previous (unblinded non-randomized) experiment with melatonin over half a year or so, which found a shift in mean ZQs of ~8 points. I was really impressed with melatonin when I first started (as have many people been), so to find vitamin D is half as hurtful as melatonin was helpful... I had no plans to take vitamin D in the evening before, but I sure as heck don't now!",1329270226

The big one for me was how I <i>must</i> start a swipe from the picture of the event, not the edge of the screen or the bottom portion with the profile pictures. The UI looks and acts almost like a scroll view, but not really.<p>Going into an event's View Details view, there are items in a table I can tap to view more details, such as See Full Description. Native iOS behavior is tapping will drill down immediately, and things can load slower if needed. It seems like there's a bit of a delay between a tap (when the table item flashes) and when the drill down happens. This time varies seemingly randomly, and can be up to a few seconds. It makes me wonder if the tap actually registered, even if it does flash.<p>The idea for the app is great, but I stopped using the app at that point because it's frustrating to have to change habits formed from using pretty much all the other apps on iOS. It's something to consider when thinking about using some non-native framework, especially for something like iOS where apps generally follow a set of human interface guidelines, as any difference in behavior can stand out like a sore thumb to users.<p>Is this something that you guys noticed or thought about internally during development?",1329268886
