And for serious wilderness navigation this kind of map folding is very unhelpful since maps tend to be big and it helps to keep the map partially folded so you can focus on one area.",1329969587

It's nice, but doesn't address the other problems of apps behaving inconsistently when resumed or disappearing from the task list (it's the same list between the button and alt-tab).<p>""Firefox is probably a worst-possible-case""<p>Indeed.

3623718,comment,3623475,3623696,3,0,colanderman,,,"When downsampling or recording, and when playing back 44.1 kHz audio, the data must be low-pass filtered to eliminate aliasing effects.<p>But filters aren't perfect.  Even a decent low-pass filter (say 3rd order Butterworth) requires an order of magnitude of bandwidth to drop the output 60 dB (practically inaudible).  This means that with a Nyquist limit of 22 kHz, you're either attenuating everything above 2.2 kHz (the ""knee""), or you're letting some aliasing noise through.<p>With a 192 kHz sampling rate, the filter's knee can rise to 9.6 kHz, and the stuff between 9.6 kHz and 20 kHz won't be appreciably attenuated.<p>It's important to note also that this attenuation can't be fixed by simply boosting the high end -- filters are linear, so such an adjustment (with an equivalent order filter) would merely cancel out the low pass filtering and reintroduce aliasing noise.<p>(Edit: I am not an audio engineer but I have a strong signal theory background.  So actual audio engineers please feel free to correct me.)",1329969297

Why is VLC the only* piece of software to combine volume level and compression-gain into a single output slider?<p>* Amusingly, the iPod's software <i>knows how</i> to apply compression just-in-time--but it only does it if you've applied a ""volume adjustment"" pragma to the song in iTunes. And then whenever the song comes up, you have to turn down your volume slider from 80% to 30% to avoid having your ears fall off, because ""loud"" on desktop speakers is a very different thing than ""loud"" on in-ear headphones.",1329969071

This is doubly true if they get rid of a giant useless logo that stalks you throughout your pages.<p>2. People were clicking it by accident. As a heavy net user, I don't feel this, but perhaps older or tablet users (but then why not fix it for them) were clicking it and pulling themselves out of Gmail. I could see this being extremely frustrating for a user trying to click the mail or search button.<p>3. They wanted to shift the functionality to the black bar. This is sort of a combination of the above two. The Google logo is pretty ambiguous. When I click it do I want to reload the page? Do I want to go to the Google homepage? Do I want  iGoogle (why did they ruin Reader temporarily but not fix the mess that is iGoogle)? Do I want to search with the bar next to the logo?
