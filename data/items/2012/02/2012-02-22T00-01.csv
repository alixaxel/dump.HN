I can appreciate that people think there's something they can contribute to it, and that they see it as a really positive win for social interaction (and I think people should work on what they want to work on).<p>But the thing is, dating sucks. Full stop. And online dating is merely trying to slightly reduce the friction for the very tiniest part at the very beginning of it. It seems to miss the whole fundamental reason why online dating is hard, which is that dating is hard, and not easily abstracted.<p>Online dating is a misnomer, it's basically just online meeting of people.",1329872395

My money is on a tiny battery built into the glasses themselves, and a screen/CPU optimized for using miniscule amounts of energy. The problem is that wireless <i>data</i> transfer still requires quite a bit of power, so they will either need to do lots of optimization to only transfer data when absolutely necessary (and turn the transceiver off the rest of the time), or come up with a system in which the glasses talk to a central device in your pocket using a low-energy data transfer scheme, and the central device talks to the network over WiFi/3G.<p>(On second thought, maybe that's what you meant by ""bluetooth to a central pack"")",1329872270

Engineers are one of the most privacy-conscious demos out there, especially under 30.<p>Just read any post on HN about any site that uses Facebook Connect.  Half the comments will be about how they refuse to so much as look at that button.<p>I disagree that going full-on-public is the right approach.<p>For women, especially, they get bombarded with all kinds of creepiness.  I think it'd be hard to get people to waive their right to hand out information at the pace they feel comfortable.<p>Anything that alienates women from a dating site is a deal-breaker, IMO.  The dating sites that do well are the ones that can attract and retain female users.<p>That said, there's a kernel of an interesting idea here.  The process of dating is revealing increasingly intimate details about ones life.  If you reach a point where it feels uncomfortable, you break up.<p>For the ""online"" portion of online dating, e.g., sending messages back and forth on OKC, this is very explicit.  Guy sends girl a message.  Girl responds.  Guy reveals name.  Girl reveals name.  etc.  Until eventually contact information is exchanged, and then you arrange an offline date.<p>So the ""core"" problem of online dating is one of building comfort.<p>One Facebook-powered feature that could build comfort might be to show how many friends you have in common (but not who).  Another might be to show where your Facebook likes intersect.<p>But forcing people to reveal all their information immediately really runs against the grain of the whole idea of dating.",1329871678

It should be possible to use FB for authentication/etc, but still maintain anonymity within the ""matching pool"".<p>I think that this is the main issue with any online-based communication: it is an awful attempt to approximate talking to a person in real life. As a middle-ground solution, I think match sites should basically arrange for online games/experiences that show a person's <i>reactions</i> to things. That's how one truly shows their personality.<p>I don't mean games in a traditional sense, either. Maybe rounds of some kind of live trivia with a twist, or whatever. So basically, nothing new. Just usual meet-market ideas, translated better into online-only experience.<p>And of course the overall thing, too, is that it should be <i>fun</i>.

There are some legitimate reasons why you might want to ""handle"" an EINTR (such as for canceling threads), but honestly they are super-advanced usage (and normally something abstracted by your threading library): 99.9999% of the time you called a blocking function, knew it might block, and intended it to block until it did something.<p>The problem with Python was that it was not retrying: it would just throw an EINTR i/o exception from its lowest-level read() bridge, and then most of the code that called that would not catch the exception. The result would be that you'd make an HTTP request and the top-level GET call would just throw ""EINTR"": it is not reasonable (or even semantically valid) to have to retry the entire HTTP request because a call to read() happened to fail while streaming the response.<p>This was sufficiently ludicrous (and sufficiently simple to fix) that I had a patch I'd apply to Python's core libraries every time I installed or upgraded my system. ... and, before anyone tries to call me on ""patch or GTFO"": someone filed a bug, with a working patch (although people tried to quibble with it; I believe incorrectly, and it certainly didn't change the result), in January of 2007, and it wasn't resolved until mid-2010.

I imagine the following discussion in the courtroom:<p><pre><code>  - You made a clean room implementation of our patent. You shall pay for that!\n\n  - No, I did not! I just copied/translated it!\n\n  - Well, then accept our apologies.\n</code></pre>\nAFAIK, both translation and copying do make derivative works. For example, one cannot translate the latest bestseller and start selling it without agreement of the publisher of the original.",1329869077

The stuff we're doing at Fogbeam Labs competes - to some extent or other - with stuff being done by Jive Software, Alfresco, Yammer, IBM, Cisco, Microsoft and a few other also-rans.  But we really don't care, because we intend to simply make better products and kick the holy shit out of Jive Software, Alfresco, Yammer, IBM, Cisco and Microsoft.<p>Oh yeah, we're a little bit brash too.

It is one of the most interesting databases out there and it's a breeze to set up (especially when compared to Cassandra).<p>It is kind of a shame though. Riak has awesome features, but some of them (e.g. secondary indexes) are hard to use and documentation is somewhat missing.<p>If you look at the official clients page (<a href=""http://wiki.basho.com/Client-Libraries.html#Ruby"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.basho.com/Client-Libraries.html#Ruby</a>), you can see ripple (<a href=""https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/seancribbs/ripple</a>) but the page doesn't mention riak-ruby-client (<a href=""https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client</a>) which was split from ripple some time ago.<p>In theory, both of them support secondary indexes as far as I can tell, but you won't find that feature in either readme. There are some specs available that somehow describe parts of it though. I still don't see clearly how I could search secondary indexes from either library.<p>The same goes for things like data vs raw_data and serializers (small discussion: <a href=""https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/pull/19"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/basho/riak-ruby-client/pull/19</a>).

I was (pleasantly) surprised by the diversity in STL and that doesn't just mean great ethnic restaurants, though large immigrant and refugee communities have resulted in some great eateries.  This is a city focused on embracing diversity.  There are countless individuals solely focused on multicultural initiatives within the government and within civic organizations.  Arch Grants is one of those groups that seeks to embrace a multicultural pool of applicants and award recipients because we want the startups we fund to reflect the diversity of St. Louis that is thriving especially within the startup community.",1329868810
