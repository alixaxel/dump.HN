If not for the moderate condescension and proselytism, I wouldn't think much of it; instead, I've become inspired to comment.<p>OP probably does feel more ""fun"" in a given month than most of us.  But the article comes across as though the reader has never experienced such a life.<p>A lot of us have - in our teenage years.  The life of skinny dipping, cross-dressing, and acting like an idiot, all without the aid of alcohol, aptly describes my own.  Sure, those times were fun, perhaps among the most fun of my life.  But a lot of that fun came from both their novelty and ignorance of the perhaps more enjoyable adult fun (alcohol, sex).  Unfortunately, as life went on, those activities grew mundane.  (Besides, one seeks higher levels of happiness as he ages, for instance the self-actualization that comes with building a successful business).  In a sense, I envy the author's enjoying such activities at 30 as much as a teen would.  Why he thinks he is able to would make a great follow-up blog post.  Most of society after all shifts to the ""adult fun"".<p>On another note, the extremism of the post bothers me.  The author equates drinking alcohol with getting drunk.  Which of course excessive consumption causes.  But I can certainly remember everything if I consume just a few shots, but those said shots certainly make the world around me seem much more entertaining.",1328414339

One for the middle school that's less than a quarter mile away and one street crossing over, and for the high school that's less than a half mile away and one street crossing over -- both have clear pedestrian walks and lights.<p>They stand there, 20 or 30 minutes waiting for the noisy bus to pick them up, then make 3 or 4 more stops, then drive the quarter of half mile to their schools where they're dumped off.<p>I don't even know what to say when I leave for work and see the lot of them huddled there waiting to be shuttled the minimal distance that they all run and walk and play after school anyways.",1328413857

It's that simple.<p>Gmail is the only email system that I can tolerate. It actually makes using email borderline fun, whereas even something like Exchange is a nightmare. It works great with various applications, smartphones and has by far the best Web interface around. It handles spam well and allows me to easy filter messages (and have those filters work across devices).<p>For most of us, email is a tool that helps us get work done and communicate with family and friends. Rolling our own solutions is not worth the extra time, headaches and lost usability.<p>Google doesn't care about our data individually. They make money in anonymized, aggregate data. That's why I don't care that they are making money off of my data, because it's not my data that they care about. It's our data that they really care about.<p>And while I'd prefer if my email didn't fall into the hands of the US government, I don't actually have anything that I care that they see in it. It's more principle than anything else. And, as a US citizen, if I rolled my own solution, I don't think it would be any safer in my hands than Google's when it comes to warrants.<p>I do have real fears. My real fears with email are in using a system that isn't usable, isn't reliable and has data integrity issues. At the end of the day, Google's servers and technical know-how surpasses mine, and I feel that my email is safer and less likely to be lost due to hardware failure in their hands than in mine.<p>It really depends on what you value. If my email information was really sensitive, I would probably care more. If I were a company that valued sensitivity a lot, I might not use Gmail. Certainly if the work you do or the industry you are in needs the utmost privacy, you should look into the most secure option as possible.<p>But as an individual, Gmail is as good as it gets for me.",1328411759

I'm sure all the terrorists also used cars and probably brushed their teeth. So what? The point of security is to figure out relevant things - that distinguish terrorist from non-terrorist - from irrelevant. Coming from US/Canada border is clearly an irrelevant thing - millions of people come through and even if one of them is a terrorist treating all of them as a terrorists would be highly ineffective. Moreover, it's even worse than ineffective - it's hurtful. Since the officers can't spend hours on every border-crosser, each innocent they wrongly detain raises the chance that they won't have the resources to inspect the real bad guy, because they were busy with harassing the good guy. The fail here is that they denied entrance to the innocent. Imagine spam filter that would put a lot of legitimate email into ""spam"" folder - would you argue it's an excellent thing to have because once 10 years ago you had one spam in your inbox - or would you argue it needs to be rewritten and fixed so that the false positive rate would go down? 
Nobody argues for no border protection at all. But border protection that confuses protecting with harassing the innocent has clearly lost the vision of its purpose and needs to be reminded of it. And if somebody from the personnel can't understand the difference he should be given a job that doesn't involve contact with people - like cesspool cleaning or monitoring early-warning radar stations in the Arctic.",1328411653
