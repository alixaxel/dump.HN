3615774,comment,3615562,3615681,3,0,simplefish,,,"A common mistake is to conflate hunter gatherer societies with the primitive agricultural societies that came after them.<p>Hunter gatherers were happy, healthy, and relatively long lived[1].  Unfortunately, they faced very sharp resource constraints - if you travel around gathering nuts and berries you need a <i>lot</i> of land for a pretty small tribe.  Still, it wasn't a bad life.<p>But for whatever reason, some hunter gatherers developed the secret of agriculture.  This changed everything - it was so phenomenally productive that for the first time there was a surplus.  One person could produce enough food for himself <i>and have some left over</i>.  This allowed the creation of an elite (priests, beauracrats, soldiers, scientists) who were <i>not</i> engaged in food production.  Unfortunately, it came at a cost:  A vastly shortly and unhappier life for pretty much everyone, but especially the non-elite.  Let me reiterate:  Being a peasant is just about the worst possible existence we have managed to come up with.<p>Modern society has, more or less, only brought adult mortality back up to hunter gatherer levels.  (Of course, it's done wonders for child mortality, which was pretty terrible under both hunter gatherer and primitive agriculture.)<p>What the original post is pining for is a return to the hunter gatherer societies, without any specialization.  Life expectancy would be MUCH higher than 30 in that scenario.  Of course, there's probably only room on this planet for about 0.2% of the current population.  Something tells me the 99.8% wouldn't be too happy about any attempts in that direction.  :)<p>[1]: Life expectancy data is hard to come by for obvious reasons, but it's seems that for modern hunter gatherers you're looking about 50 years.  That's a little misleading, because only about 2/3rds of children made it to 15; of the 15 year olds about 4/5ths made it to 45; of the 45 year olds, mean remaining lifespan was around 20 years.  In other words, if you survive childhood, you're likely to see, at least, your 60s, and you've got a decent chance of seeing 80.  That's radically different than what we think primitive life was like, because we're thinking of privative agriculture, which was entirely different.",1329814625

3615754,comment,3615110,3615609,2,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Yeah, the data size is a big problem, but the bitcoin dev team is working on a bitcoin-lite client to solve that problem.  Their eventual solution might be repurposable for bitmail.<p>And here's another thought about that - just delete all messages from the blockchain after they're read, and only store them locally in the clients.  As soon as the receiving client unencrypts the message, store it locally, then delete it completely from the blockchain.  Unlike bitcoin, this wouldn't be an accounting ledger with the necessity of storing all transactions in perpetuum.  All that needs to happen is the message get delivered to its recipient, once that is verified to have happened, it can be deleted.  The clients can keep copies and organize them into conversations or whatever.<p>That wouldn't quite solve the issue of hardware eventually being able to brute force the encryption though, since an interested party could store a running record of everything put into and deleted from the blockchain.  But it would have to be a very interested party to store that amount of data in the hopes of being able to decrypt it years or decades later.<p>Bitcoin wasn't really designed for deletions though, and that would also double the rate of blockchain diffs, so would have to think more about how or if that would work...",1329813880

I did't mean regular email addresses, but was actually thinking of bitmail-only email addresses.  Perhaps ones based on Namecoin .bit domains.<p>But I wasn't suggesting interop with existing email infrastructure, this would be completely separate.  In fact, the idea would be to disrupt and supplant the regular email we all know and love, at least for some use cases where privacy is paramount.<p>Everyone would have their bitmail client which they could use to send encrypted email, as well as their regular Gmail addresses and whatnot.  Most people have multiple emails anyway, this would just be one more.<p>One nice thing about bitcoin, which would carry over to bitmail, is that despite the core technology (the official client) being completely outside and orthogonal to the current financial system, it's very easy to use for its fundamental purpose.  Sending and receiving bitcoins is just simple.  I envision the core bitmail client would work similarly and be similarly simple.

Good for you.  But the essence of (true, classical) liberalism is the recognition that everyone has the right to their own list of needs and wants.  I am not you; nor is anyone else.  I am allowed to have different marginal utility curves for time, leisure, and consumer goods.  Society needs to work for us all, not just your personal aesthetic ideal.<p>2) More generally, <i>there are no absolutes</i>.  You try to turn to an imagined, mythical golden era.  ""If humans managed to do without [...] I can also.""  This is incoherent.  What does it mean to be human?  We are plains apes who have figured out a few tricks.  In our time we've managed to ""do without"" pretty much everything, including clean water and nutritious food.  And as for a ""place to sleep"", we've lived in mud huts, igloos, under bushes, in hovels, tents, wagons...and also penthouses, palaces, and six bedroom McMansions.  Comfort has value.  More to some of us; less to others.<p>3) You also seem to struggle with logic.  There is a LOT of logic to having a large house and only intensively using a small part: Space is not a scarce resource, but the flexibility of having a lot of space is nice.  Do you purposefully buy the smallest hard drive you can?  After all, I'm sure you only access a small fraction of that 1TB hard drive on any given day...  There's also a lot of logic to heating an entire house; it's simple and easy, and heat is cheap.  Really, the median family in the US does not have to slave all day to pay their heating bill.  Nor to purchase their car; you do not work anything remotely LIKE 8 hours a day to pay for your car.  How about a few minutes?<p>4) The lawn mower example is so absurd as to deserve a point all on its own:  This is an already solved problem.  It's called a ""lawn service"".  They're quite popular, you should look into it.<p>5) You decry people spending money in order to efficiently wash their clothes.  You then turn, without pause, to decry a lack of efficiency.  And then, to cap it off, to attack specialization, the <i>ONE MOST IMPORTANT</i> increase in efficiency we as a species have yet invented.  Words fail me; I simply cannot grapple with the magnitude of cognitive dissonance these sentences have egendered in me except to ask:  Is this some sort of joke?  Are you trolling?  Because if so, you win.<p>6) Even so, your entire rant about specialization has been said far better by a far better human than you:  ""A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.""  Who here doesn't feel their heart stir upon reading that?  And I've spent more than a few hours working my way through that list.  And yet...<p>...and yet the great RAH is wrong.  A society without specialization is a tribe of hunter gatherers.  If you want anything more - be it material goods, services, or even our modern morality - then you need specialization.  You get to pick one:  A primitive hunter gatherer society, or specialization.  If you are not <i>personally</i> gathering all the food you eat and crafting all the clothing and tools you use, then you have specialization.  And if you are doing that, then you will eat nuts and berries, wear furs, and have no tools.  Full stop.  There are no other options.<p>7) You have a point buried under all the mistakes.  Don't be defined by one of your activities, even if it happens to be the only one you make any money at.  Have some idea of who you are as a person, and live that as much as you can, in as many aspects of your life as you can.  It's equally stupid to have no life outside of your job as it is to work at a job you hate so that you can do what you really like outside of it.  Strive to be a whole human being.  Great idea!<p>...but get over the ridiculous ideas about specialization and efficiency.  They have nothing to do with your core point, and they're naively wrong.  People have unlimited needs and wants, and any given person is going to spend their resources in a way different from yours.  That's what being a human is all about; any effort to stamp that out leads to the same insect-like existence that you (and RAH) were complaining about with regards to specialization.",1329812841

I'm sure other countries have different problems.<p>Just prior to quitting my job to start my own company, my wife was diagnosed with a health issue. My wife and I were both on the company plan. When we went looking for insurance, she was denied because of her 'pre-existing' issue.<p>So, we've had to keep her on expensive COBRA until it expires and then there is something after COBRA that we can hopefully switch her to. I hear that there is legislation to prevent insurance companies from denying people coverage if they already have it, but who knows when that'll happen, if ever. I've been able to switch to my own plan, but it still seems really expensive since I very rarely need medical help.<p>That said, the industry is a mess. The plans are very confusing and definitely directed towards getting the most out of you. No plan is a 'good deal'. The fact that there is three different insurance plans that you need (medical, dental and vision) shows how broken things are. I ended up using a broker who helped explain things a lot. The fact that I needed a broker to explain it is also broken.<p>Sites like ehealthinsurance.com are massive spammers (try putting your real information in, you'll get phone calls, emails, etc.) and are really no less confusing. It is like they purposely make it hard to figure stuff out by using terminology that nobody else understands and burring it in their website behind forms which ask for your information first. You better figure out what hmo, ppo, copay, coinsurance and deductible mean and how they affect office visits and prescriptions. Then, chart it all out and if you are lucky pick something that seems like what you might need. Once you've got that done, fill out 20 pages of forms with all of your medical history.<p>Grrr... just thinking about it all makes me so angry. It is such a huge waste.",1329812797
