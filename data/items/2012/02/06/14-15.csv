3557596,comment,3557206,3557522,4,0,mekoka,,,"There are very few rational reasons to be using utf-16 instead of utf-8 and I would be as bold as to claim that the two aren't even close in popularity for non-ascii texts, utf-8 is clearly well above. Regarding memory consumption, latin texts also primordially use ascii characters, with only the occasional non-ascii glyphs (cedillas, accents, tremas and other such characters), the difference between utf-8 and 16 is that the former uses 1 byte to represent characters in the ascii range and 2 bytes for the occasional â, whereas the latter <i>always</i> uses 2 bytes, which would explain utf-8's popularity in latin based alphabets. Also, because having ordinary characters whose code points are padded with zeros is just wasteful and inefficient, utf-16 and its brethren utf-32 introduced funky attempts at optimizations such as Byte Order Marks. Why would anyone wanna deal with this stuff when writing an internationalized program?",1328540333

3557594,comment,3557074,3557074,11,0,bdg,,,"I read a neat book that partially covered this topic, called ""Click"" : <a href=""http://books.google.ca/books?id=RK3OHBGj2SkC&printsec=frontcover&dq=0385529058&hl=en&sa=X&ei=d-MvT5SbHIin0AHAk6nwCg&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.ca/books?id=RK3OHBGj2SkC&printsec=fr...</a><p>The book talks about how interactions between people/things/events work. The author talks about how we can feel more connected based on vulnerability, proximity, flow, similarity, and environment.<p>The part on flow discussed how a champion racecar driver gets ""in the zone"" or ""flow"". As someone who's done programming competitions in the past (in a room where others are writing code against you) I could absolutely relate, time outside just washes out of sight, the curly braces become an extension of you, it's a down-right magical feeling.<p>There's another concept I feel is related to this, and I don't want to jump the shark here but, if you think about how we reach mastery of things we know (or, in other words, you can read sheet music, but can't play the guitar like a pro because every few notes you make a small pause and think about the next few notes), we're focusing on our impulses, or rather, eliminating them.  This TED video does a much more fun/elegant explanation of impulses: <a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_zander_on_music_and_passio...</a><p>I find it interesting that when I'm personally in a state of ""flow"", I'm working without any ""impulses"". To me it appears like the two are related: you need to be able to work without impulses in any given skill before you can enter flow (otherwise, you break out of flow). Now, this isn't enough, and I feel this is where we get back into the ""connections"" or ""relationships"" discussed in Click. To me it appears we as programmers have a better predisposition simply because the computer can create for us a synthetic reality free of normal distractions, we can tweak our proximity to a machine should we need to (mod your PC case and feel proud, love your mac book, set up your desktop just the way you like it), we know how vulnerable it can be to different things (viruses, long running programs, leaky memory), we experience it enough that it's very familiar and similar to things we've experienced before (try switching editors or color themes for a day, you'll understand how your similarity impacts your ability to get into flow), we can control almost all of the environment. In this synthetic universe we are better predisposed to making all the mental connections we need to feel like we're using an extension of ourselves rather than a machine.<p>This goes back to what we've long known: programmers need to know their stuff in and out, and need to work in an environment they have control over.",1328540273

3557590,comment,3557247,3557247,29,0,lloeki,,,"Wild guess at where it might come from:<p>32ms divided by 4 is 0.008s which gives us 125Hz (the typical mouse sample rate). So my guess is that some form of mouse movement analysis (like mouse smoothing) is working on at least four samples (so that it can statistically mean something), rolling.<p>Why it does so might be that 32ms is the right time to evaluate the intent of a typical human interaction with a pointer, maybe even using some form of inverse kinematics, so that when you move your hand towards a small button aiming is smoothly assisted, and/or click target is helpfully adjusted in size to enhance Fitt's law compliance (like iOS keyboard keys dynamically changing sizes depending on the sequence of letters, hence words you type)<p>Of course this bites hard outside of this environment. It seems Mac OS X needs an API to provide some form of raw value access to the pointer so that arbitrary software (notably games) can conduct its own analysis.<p>Anecdotally, my personal experience has been that it never bothered me, neither in games (FPS and RTS) nor in WIMP.",1328540192

Why? Well, for one: various games circumvent OS X’s own mouse speed/acceleration settings, and when they do so instantly reproduce the ‘feel’ from Windows. The same is true when emulating Windows through virtualisation software. If this was a hardware lag issue, then surely both of these would be affected too? And even were it a hardware issue, it shows that you can remedy it in software.<p>I'd long believed that the problem would never be addressed, and then a couple of months ago I used a new Apple Magic Mouse with Lion; the acceleration and speed was so good out of the box that I didn't install USB Overdrive as part of my new Mac setup routine for the first time in over 5 years. Could it be that it's a driver issue, or just different devices have different acceleration characteristics? Perhaps, but whatever the case might be, I'm far less inclined to attribute it to input lag.",1328539730

Periset National Chung-Hsing University, Taiwan, itu meneliti efek penurunan lemak alias hipolipidemik karena senyawa glikosaminoglikan. Senyawa itu terkandung dalam teripang Metriatyla scabra. Glikosaminoglikan alias GAGs teripang mengandung asam heksosamin dan heksuronat. Percobaan selanjutnya dilakukan terhadap tikus winstar berbobot 5 g, 10 g, 15 g, dan 20 g. Tikus-tikus itu diberi 1% kolesterol selama 6 pekan sehingga total kolesterol, LDL, dan bobot hati meningkat. Kemudian tikus-tikus itu diberikan 20 mg glikosaminoglikan per kg bobot tubuh. Efeknya total kolesterol, LDL dan indeks atherogenik turun; HDL meningkat. Selain itu GAGs terbukti mencegah peningkatan trigliserida, kolesterol dan fosfolipid dalam hati. Sterol yang terdapat didalam teripang juga menurunkan kolesterol. Zat itu menghadang penyerapan kolesterol pada pembuluh darah manusia sebanyak 15%.<p>Selain teripang, konsumsi rutin alpokat mencegah peningkatan kolesterol. Buah Persea americana itu kaya antioksidan yang mencegah melonjaknya kolesterol. Bahan nabati lainnya, bawang merah dan bawang putih memiliki senyawa aktif ajoene, antikolesterol yang mencegah penggumpalan darah. Kedua sayuran bumbu itu salah satu pilihan untuk mengatasi kolesterol yang melambung. Beberapa siung umbi lapis anggota famili Liliaceae itu dapat dimakan segar. Dua siung bawang putih setiap hari, hindarkan tubuh dari kolesterol jahat, kata Lukas Tersonoadji, herbalis di Tangerang. (Vina Fitriani).

Why would they want to give away those prizes?<p>Alternatively you could flip the idea on it's head and instead of expecting sponsor companies to donate prizes, just set up a really solid referral system, This process is pretty tricky using existing methods.<p>So a company that wants users starts a campaign. Your site generates a unique url for each promoter so that they can tweet/share. The company then tracks the signups through your leaderboard and rewards each promoter per sale, perhaps with a bonus for the top performer.<p>Nothing motivates like helping others to earn money. I guess it's similar to how Clickbank works in a way.",1328537918

Hence it is a sane choice as a default encoding for people who are scared of having to think about encodings. Because UTF-8 is not the only encoding out there, Unicode-compatible programs accept Unicode text in many other encodings, including those that cannot represent the full range of Unicode and are only a good choice for some people but not others.<p>tl;dr: non-UTF-8 text can (and should) still be read as unicode codepoints.
