Apple's probably in better shape on that front (having already moved architectures once, and so having more of a system to include a compatibility layer), but users are going to be questioning why 95% of their software doesn't run, or runs very slowly, on their new and expensive laptop.<p>The middle ground is something like a Chromebook, which gets around the problem by not running any legacy apps. However, despite what Google thinks there's a lot of utility in a laptop outside of the browser, and people who have software that they need to run will not be moving over to ARM for a long time.",1328611562

Please inform people, instead of making empty statements.<p>SSH Agent forwarding let the remote host query your local agent. The agent responds to challenges. The private key is NEVER transmitted.<p>So no, its absolutely NOT equivalent to storing your private key on the remote server - did you think OpenSSH were that dumb?<p>The risk with SSH agent forwarding, is that <i>as long as your session is running with agent forwarding on</i> the remote host can query challenges and use them to authenticate anywhere you're allowed to authenticated to, granted that your ssh-agent keys are currently unlocked.<p>So indeed, using SSH agent forwarding every where is bad practice. But it doesn't mean you can't use it. You just need to know it's limitations.<p>When not used, you can use ssh -oProxyCommand='ssh -W jumphost targethost 22' targethost and/or put it in the ssh config, which is actually more convenient in most common cases.<p>It's also tiring to see so called ssh tricks every next day, asif everyone didnt see yesterday's one.

3561256,comment,3559699,3559699,1,0,_delirium,,,"This can have some interesting side-benefits from a hackerly perspective. Out of a mixture of frugality and fondness for the compact form-factor, I used my 12"" G4 PowerBook way past its prime, which towards the end was an interesting exercise in both cross-platform compatibility (after Apple's x86 switch), and in optimizing my desktop experience to use more efficient apps and setups. I've often thought there would be some benefits (admittedly offset with some downsides) if hardware actually moved slower, and people kept their machines for, say, 2x as long on average.<p>Even with things like game consoles, I think the progress of technology means we move on before we really understand what a machine can do. I recently read a book on the Atari VCS, which fairly convincingly argued that during its short commercial life only a small portion of the platform's design space was really explored (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/026201257X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=abxxm-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=026201257X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/026201257X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?...</a>).<p>Admittedly those are pretty different kinds of motivations than the ethical issues around production.",1328611101
