What's more, because of the ""I'll vote your shit up if you vote mine up"" mentality, and the ability to easily follow users to see what they submit and vote on, they also acquired hoards of normal users who would do the same without reciprocity in hopes of joining the top ranks.<p>It would've been a fairly worthless currency if not for the blogspam networks like Gizmodo, Engadget, Tech Crunch, Mashable, Cracked, Life Hacker, etc. that sprung up to funnel Digg's firehose of users on to ad-laden pages.<p>While no system would be perfect, Digg's made it excessively easy to game (maliciously or otherwise) and the content of submissions soon became almost irrelevant compared to who was submitting it.",1342317593

4245829,comment,4245737,4245737,17,0,zacharyvoase,,,"Data structure and functions should not be bound together  I can't agree with you more.<p>However, in Smalltalk (and even Ruby, to some degree) objects are <i>not</i> data structures, they are collections of functions invokable on a 'thing' with an unknown structure. They have an internal structurepotentially immutablebut you never see this, because you only interact with methods on the object.<p>And in many cases, there is syntactic sugar to make invocation of these methods look like slot access: think of Objective-Cs `@property`, or Python's descriptors, or Ruby's `def method=(value)`.<p>When people talk about 'object-oriented languages' in such general terms I get frustrated, because there's a lot more nuance to this than simply 'bundles of functions and data structures'. That's a very implementation-led way of looking at it. The reality is that these objects are supposed to represent real-life situations where knowledge of what something is, or how it behaves, or how it fulfills its contracts is unknown. If NASA's Remote Agent[1] had been implemented in Haskell, OCaml or ML, do you think debugging DS1 would have been as simple as connecting to a REPL and changing some definitions in a living core? I don't think the image-based persistence of SmallTalk and many Lisps would be possible in a purely functional or traditional procedural language.<p>And what is a data type anyway? It's supposed to represent a mathematical set of possible values. Sure, you can use a simple array to build a b-tree, but don't you want to explicitly state that <i>variable x is a b-tree</i> if that's the case? I was always taught that explicit is better than implicit.<p>I should probably stop ranting now, it's just that if youre going to start hating on programming paradigms, at least <i>sound</i> like you've thought your argument through a bit more.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html</a>",1342316691

The most important aspect is a systematic approach to obtaining customers.<p>The real tricky part though is figuring out how to use each traction approach (the article calls them verticals) properly.  For example, in my first three years of business, I learned a bunch of hard lessons here.  These include:<p>1)  Most advertising doesn't work unless people already know of you.  Push your advertising later.  Advertising that does work at that stage is that which has a personal feel to it (like infomercials).<p>2)  PR is golden.  Go for it at every opportunity.<p>3)  Your biggest friend is your competition.  If you can reach out and build good relationships with folks who are already in the field, that is support that can't be underrated.  I thought at first that this was specific to smaller businesses but it turns out that the more I look into it, the more many successful businesses of all size do it, and do well because of it.<p>4)  Public service announcements are very good as well.  If you are just doing tech support, and the local radio station has an open hour or so, call up every time there is a major virus outbreak and let folks know.  Or buy advertisement space in these cases, or the like.",1342316449

You organize your software into business objects, or components, and have these interact with each other. They allow you to separate it out in a way that a new developer can come to the project, understand what the code <i>should</i> be doing, and look for the classes which seem the like objects involved, including the types of data it has and the things it can do.<p>There are all sorts of nasty things we've invented in OO over the past few years (mixing up inheritance and composition, using way too much state), but it gives us a lot of advantages from an engineering point of view.",1342316203

Likewise, they had a massive problem with Silvio Berlusconi. As a human being, they held him in the deepest possible contempt. They were entirely open about this, and dedicated much effort to detailing the causes of their overtly intense dislike.<p>Some disregard what they have to say as ""mere opinion"" to which they'd say ""No, this is informed opinion.""

My takeaway from it is: a <i>lot</i> of them simply do not have the intelligence to operate in many highly technical jobs. This isn't a slight on them - they're amazing, worthwhile human beings, but it's unreasonable to expect them to be able to write code, even given an arbitrarily large amount of training. For every IQ 120, there is an IQ 80. Remember that.<p>The other side of it is that our school system performs appallingly poorly, and fails a lot of the population. Even if someone had the natural intelligence and aptitude, for a lot of them their educational background is so poor that there is no meaningful way for them to catch up, ever. A person of solid intellect who, for whatever reasons, barely made his way out of high school math, is not going to be able to pick up a CS curriculum. The foundation we're working from is not very solid.<p>The third component is of course the system - if someone wanted to retrain as a professional programmer from a factory job, and let's assume magically that he/she has the intelligence to do it, <i>and</i> unexpectedly did really well in school a long time ago. They're about as ideally positioned as one can be... except who's going to pay for the retraining? Who's going to hire the 40 year-old who <i>just</i> got into programming?

If I remember right the did some big refactoring of the compiler and found some places where this macro facility made that work less verbose.<p><a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012/Reflection-and-Compilers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Lang-NEXT/Lang-NEXT-2012/Ref...</a><p>It's been a while since I watched this talk, so I may have the details wrong.  It's a great talk, but at least read the abstract:<p><i>Reflection and compilers do tantalizing similar things. Yet, in mainstream, statically typed languages the two have been only loosely coupled, and generally share very little code. In this talk I explore what happens if one sets out to overcome their separation.<p>The first half of the talk addresses the challenge how reflection libraries can share core data structures and algorithms with the language's compiler without having compiler internals leaking into the standard library API. It turns out that a component system based on abstract types and path-dependent types is a good tool to solve this challenge. I'll explain how the ""multiple cake pattern"" can be fruitfully applied to expose the right kind of information.<p>The second half of the talk explores what one can do when strong, mirror-based reflection is a standard tool. In particular, the compiler itself can use reflection, leading to a particular system of low-level macros that rewrite syntax trees. One core property of these macros is that they can express staging, by rewriting a tree at one stage to code that produces the same tree at the next stage. Staging lets us implement type reification and general LINQ-like functionality. What's more, staging can also be applied to the macro system itself, with the consequence that a simple low-level macro system can produce a high-level hygienic one, without any extra effort from the language or compiler.</i>",1342314990
