In the strict typing case that is what happened, there was no approach that was satisfactory to all, so the decision was to remain with the status quo.

That right there is a sure sign that something is rotten in the state of the patent system.</i><p>This sentence has made me think that there seems to be an amazing parallel between the patent industry and medicine.  In the past, patents were quite simple and few, and one could see how things should go in patent disputes.  Patents did not get complicated at a granular level because the level of knowledge necessary to identify how complex things can actually get did not exist yet.<p>For medicine as well, symptom analysis and disease diagnosis was very limited to our level of knowledge.  As our knowledge increased, the complexity of our treatment strategies increased, such that there is a large overhead for diagnosis and treatment, just like there is a large overhead for patent disputes.<p>edit: great example:  <a href=""http://xkcd.com/931/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/931/</a><p>The difference is that for patents, it probably doesn't need to be as complex as it is, while for medicine, it probably does need to be as complex as it is.",1342155070

4238263,comment,4237213,4237410,6,0,einhverfr,,,"Not only small laws, in the eyes of the feds.  I <i>highly</i> recommend reading Harvey Silverglate's (veteran of the EFF, ACLU and the FIRE) book ""Three Felonies a Day:  How the Feds Target the Innocent.""  He discusses the issues of vagueness in federal felony statutes.<p>Think about it this way, the efforts to convict Jeff Skilling (yes, of Enron) of ""Honest Services Fraud"" would make reading HN from work a federal felony.  Note that after the book was published, the Supreme Court threw out Skilling's conviction for honest services fraud on the basis of vagueness.  But many other issues remain.<p>For example, I design my billing cycles on the principle of minimizing invoices of greater than $10k.  Is this a federal felony?  By some interpretations, it might be.  Part of the reason is I don't want lots of my payments from customers being reported to the federal government.  Part of the reason is that larger numbers of smaller invoices make cash flow a little easier to manage.  Part of it is that I have found that banks don't like seeing a lot of large transactions and therefore my life is easier vis a vis the banks if I keep those to a minimum.  But I think such statutes will have to be read narrowly.<p>><i>I am gonna be completely honest, I am scared to express myself any longer on the Internet in any fashion. I don't trust it any longer. I don't trust the police, I don't trust the FBI, I don't trust the federal government, and I also don't trust, nor have faith, in the justice system in the United States.</i><p>The internet is for marketing yourself, not expressing yourself.",1342154981

4238200,comment,4234912,4236836,4,0,quanticle,,,"<i>There are hundreds of IP lawyers with strong technical backgrounds who could tell the difference between the patent in your example and say the OFDM patent [snip]</i><p>Okay, let's take that argument and run with it. If there are so very many talented IP lawyers with strong technical backgrounds, then why is patent law so bad in the first place? Why are we even having this discussion?<p>I think there are two reasons. First, I don't think there are enough good IP lawyers covering software patents and software patent law. Why? Software is a very new field and it is changing very quickly. Even the foundational structures of our industry are less than a century old. As such, it's very easy to sneak through ""obvious"" patents simply because they don't look obvious to someone outside the field. Second, the patent attorneys who do understand how software works and how software patents can be used to constrain and thwart software development all seem to be employed by patent trolls.<p>For example, let's look at the recent Kelora patent case [1]. In this case, Kelora patented ""parametric search"" (e.g. drill-down search). They then filed suit against basically every online retailer that allowed shoppers to drill down by category. Now, to a programmer or a web developer, the concept for drill-down hierarchical search is obvious, maybe even a bit blas. But to someone who isn't as well versed in software development, it can definitely look like a new innovation that deserves patent protection.<p>Fortunately, in this case, the patent was overturned. But not before it did its damage. Before Kelora took on the big companies, it managed to win settlements from a number of smaller firms [2]. That highlights the true cost of software patents. The cost isn't mainly from the patents that are contested in court. The cost is mainly from the patents that aren't. It's the cost of a business that has to shut down because it violates a patent it didn't know existed. It's the cost of man years wasted because a product has to be redesigned to avoid patent litigation.<p>Yes, patents do protect innovation. However, they protect certain innovations at the cost of making other innovations much more difficult. In software, especially, they form a tragedy of the anti-commons, where, in effect, your competition has veto power over your innovation. It is increasingly clear to me that these costs do not justify the limited benefit that patent protection brings for software. That is why software patents should be abolished. They are simply not worth the cost.<p>[1] <a href=""http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/4:2010cv04947/235910/153/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/califor...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/26/kelora-obvious-software-patents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/26/kelora-obvious-software-pat...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_anti-commons"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_anti-commons</a>",1342152910

So kudos for fighting the good fight:<p>http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jul/12/google-legalise-love-campaign-rocks<p>However, Google fighting homophobia is always going to be a fairly ephemeral notion. There will be gains and progress, but it's hard to say what a success scenario looks like for Google on this issue.<p>I'll tell you what's not ephemeral, though: America's un-winnable ""war"" on street drugs. It doesn't seem to matter how many African America males they lock up, how many billions of dollars are allocated to ruining the lives of recreational drug users. It doesn't matter that Amsterdam is one of the most civilized places on Earth, or that Portugal's drug epidemic has improved dramatically in most age groups since decriminalization. Quite simply, so long as there's status quo partisan politics and intense lobbying, the saga will continue forever.<p>That is, unless a logically reasoned and highly funded progressive organization steps in and makes a lot of noise.
