But only because we have a limited time on earth before another massive extinction event occurs and realistically solving all the problems with space travel at light speed have such a tiny percentage of being solved that you might as well say its impossible for the sake of being realistic.<p>Lets look at your rebuttal:<p>1) Time dilation doesn't solve ANY of the impossibilities of traveling at light speed. Even the Earth, with its massive atmospheric force field and magnetic field only travels at 67,000 mph and still gets pummeled with meteors, natural space debris, and massive amounts of radiation that, despite being filtered out by a magnetic field thousands of miles thick, still delivers radiation. A tiny particle the size of a ballpoint from a ballpoint pen is nothing to fear, but when that particle is hits anything at light speed it is deadly. If there is 1 piece of space debris every 1 mile in space and you're traveling at light speed, the ship, no matter what it's made of is going to disintegrate when it gets hit with 11.1 million pieces of debris every minute. At that speed nothing can be deflected by shields all objects will disintegrate and rip the ship and crew apart.<p>Back to radiation: With 2 hydrogen atoms per cubic centimeter in space, at light speed the radiation exposure increases 100,000% PAST THE LETHAL LIMIT for humans. We would die of radiation exposure immediately. It would also destroy electronics on board. And NO, building an artificial force field is not going to work either. At light speed it will be useless. Also no force field of any kind will work or be able to work at such a high speed.<p>2) Still doesn't solve the unfilterable radiation problem, space debris problem, emotional toll, and cost. Granted things WILL improve in the future. They usually do. The problem is, we're both assuming that we will still be around long enough to figure this stuff out. Yes, we humans are smart and resilient but we live in an opportunist world where the longer any species stays alive (humans) the more counter-species (viruses/plague/bacteria) evolve to feed off of and kill the former species. We've extended our stay for quiet a while and are just now starting to feel our eventual fate with the rise of super viruses, antibiotic resistant bacteria, and super flus. And it will only get worse. As we evolve our microsized enemies do too. Lets not forget we're also self destructive.<p>3) Agreed, we could create habitats that don't kill us but this is assuming we actually reach another planet. Which just isn't going to happen.<p>4) <i>We would go visit a society that was in its early stages of development just to see how they do it.</i> At the cost of trillions of dollars and the lives of thousands, possibly millions of people over the course of thousands or millions of years. I don't think so.",1341209489
