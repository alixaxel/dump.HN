4245964,comment,4245737,4245949,7,0,it,,,"The problem is that OO thinking tends to inflate systems, spreading code all over the place even though it logically belongs in one place and adding object wrappers to things that don't need it. In my experience taking over Python code written by Java developers, I can usually shrink their OO code and make it more reliable by refactoring it into conceptually equivalent functional code wherever it makes sense and falling back on procedural style where appropriate.",1342321124

It's an indication they have no clue what they are talking about and also don't consider carbon emissions a serious problem.<p>Many studies have been done on fracking, and there is every indication that with sound regulation and proper practices it is a perfectly safe technique for extracting natural gas. More so, using natural gas for energy instead of oil or especially coal is an enormous carbon emissions win. Far greater than any hybrid or even all electric vehicle technology can achieve. To write it off as an evil because you heard some anecdotal evidence somewhere just proves you don't take the fundamental problems of energy production and the environment seriously.",1342321050

OO introduces some weird issues that aren't immediately apparent:
1. Verbosity
When the shortest method call looks like ""abcObject.functionXYZ()"",  code gets huge really fast character-wise. This actually does make it harder to read and debug existing code.<p>2. Multithreading
Multithreading in any programming paradigm is a pain, I'd give you that. But OO exacerbates the problem because of the way each property of an object is essentially a global state within its local scope. It makes it quite tricky to enforce thread safety.<p>Having said that, I'm not sure that rewriting it in, say, a functional style would make things simpler. Sure it is easier to prove correctness, but as soon as you introduce IOs, everything goes to hell. I guess OO seems to be the worst pattern, except for all others that have been tried.",1342320341

But that's not how the source code usually looks, and there are Lisp compilers which optimize it so it's not done as a conditional.<p>In CLOS, it will look as a separate DEFMETHOD for each type you want to define the function on, and these can be in separate modules.  DEFMETHOD will just extend the generic function.  And the function itself can be optimized to use the normal tricks -- things kind of like vtables -- to optimize performance.<p>The S3 example is a bit facile since (1) S3 objects are like mud, they're all the same and (2) they map cleanly to the OO paradigm since they encapsulate discrete chunks of external state.  At the other end we can throw around examples like BLAS and LAPACK, whose functions are much closer to the ""functional ideal"" (ignoring mutability, here).  For example, if I want to solve a linear equation, how do I express that as a single dispatch method?  Does it go on the matrix, or on the vector?  Or do I have to create a new object from the two called LinearSystem, just so I can invoke a single method?<p>We think about things in terms of coupled data, as pure functions, and as dirty generic functions (like the Lisp example).  The only real lesson is that people get pissed off at languages that force them to shoehorn everything into one category (like Java).",1342318968

Macros allow you to generate source code <i>reliably</i> - or put another way, they let you refactor your code far more than you ever thought possible. (When you realize how easy it is to write Lisp programs that recursively define other valid Lisp programs, it's not hard to see why it's such a favorite of the AI community![1])<p>But here's the catch - for the kind of reliability that MJD talks about, you need to have the <i>internal</i> representation of the language be a fundamental data structure in the language, not just the textual representation.<p>Why's that? It's simple:<p>> It's nice to use standard list operations in a macro instead of needing to learn AST magic.<p>In Lisp, the internal representation is a list. The AST is a list.

And then someone changes Dog and gives your Boston a tail... I dunno. I have only vague intuitions here, but perhaps the ""objects as models of reality"" might be perfectly suited for reality simulators of some sort that require stateful elements a la Sim City but not generally. Or, perhaps a better example: You could model a chess game as classes of Pieces on a Board, with methods like King.isInCheck(), or Queen.canMoveTo(Square) but this to me seems clumsier than simply having an 8x8 array of enums with the logic living in functions and not inside individual pieces.",1342318633

I think the truth is more nuanced than that.  State is, in many cases, extremely necessary to track.  The problem is that state errors create bugs that are very difficult to track down (you can eventually figure the state out, but how did it get corrupted)?  A better approach I think is for state to be approached declaratively and with constraints.  This is why things like foreign keys, check constraints, etc. in the RDBMS world are so nice. In fact good db design usually has a lot to do with eliminating possible state errors.  Wouldn't it be great if OOP environments gave that possibility!

The counterargument to the OP is that surely a function that manipulates ""data"" is less powerful and abstract than one that manipulates objects.<p>For example, take an ""interface"" or abstract data type like Array, consisting of a length() and a get(i) method.  (This is really called List in Java and Seq in Scala.)  There may even be an associated type, A, such that all items are of type A.  This is very powerful because functions written against the Array interface don't depend on the implementation; we can store the data different ways, calculated it on demand, etc.<p>The ""binding together"" Joe is complaining about is binding the implementation of length() and get(i) to the implementation of the data structure, which is surely understandable.  The alternative, seen in Lisps and other ""verb-oriented"" languages, is that there is a global function called ""length"" which takes an object... er, a value... and desperately tries to figure out how to measure its length properly, perhaps with a giant conditional.<p>The original OO (SmallTalk) was about message passing rather than abstract data types; just the idea that an object was responsible for responding to certain messages, and that these communication patterns completely characterized the object.  This is how we think about modern cloud services, too; it's kind of inevitable.  Who would complain that S3's ""functions"" and ""data"" are too coupled?  Who would ask for a description of S3 in terms of what sequence of calls to car and cdr it makes internally?  OO concepts allow a functional description of a system that starts at the top and can stop at any point.<p>The ""everything is an object"" philosophy gets a bad rap.  It's a big pain in Java, especially, because of how the type system works.  Ideally I'd be able to define a type of ints between 1 and 3, an obvious subclass of ints in general, whereas in Java I find myself declaring ""class [or enum] IntBetweenOneAndThree"" or some nonsense.",1342317920
