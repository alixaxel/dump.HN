4183661,comment,4182543,4183589,2,0,mtigas,,,"For my blog, static files (anything stored in an app's ""static"" directory, basically[1]) the like are handled transparently through django-storages' S3 support [2]. (The STATICFILES_STORAGE option in settings.) If youve used Django's staticfiles framework before, its pretty much plug-and-play.<p>For more dynamic file storage (say, using FileField or ImageField in a model), I believe django-storages would work, too. (Make sure you configure django-storages with the DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE option set to S3 also.)<p>Assuming youre managing your site via a local dev server (or a server that ""hosts"" the ""hot type"" version of the site), any time you ""upload"" a file to your local server, it'll actually upload to S3 (and any calls to ""field.url"" will actually map to the S3 URL). Not sure how well it'll work in all use cases: I haven't actually used FileField or ImageField myself in the django-medusa+django-storages usecase, but I <i>have</i> used both separately so Im fairly sure this is possible.<p>This is a pretty darn good question though, so Ill likely make a follow-up blogpost with a more comprehensive walkthrough regarding handling staticfiles and FileField/ImageField. Sometime in the near future.<p>Multiple sites/subdomains is a bit more complicated. Id say you should probably use separate Django instances for each and render them separately. (For S3, youd need to use separate buckets, anyway.) If they <i>need</i> to share data, you can configure multiple Django settings.py configurations for each site but still use the same source tree and local database.

Rather, you're going to build something like Expensify that saves individual employees from some of the more irritating things they may have to do with PeopleSoft.<p>Brilliant way to put this. The way to compete with old enterprise software is first by not doing it the way they're doing it. I would start with something that appeals to individual employees, make their work easier, even joyful, and eventually you'll work up to top level decision makers.<p>By then you'll have a fantastic user-centric product and a list of features an exec team would drool over.",1341111341

Moving an entire fleet to replace the one lost, could take months, hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars, loss of morale in troops, and an economic disaster (the markets would simply tank to the lowest).<p>And of course, moving a fleet to replace the one lost, would mean that you have to lower your guard in another front, which itself introduces new kind of problems.

At the same time, China or Russia would be selling more equipment to the other party.<p>Right-wing groups would ask for a full retaliation, or more possibly, asking for allies to get involved, but that could rapidly escalate to a regional or global conflict, as other countries would try to support the one playing ""David"" here.<p>At that point, with the markets falling apart and clamoring for heads to roll, it would simply be unfeasible to continue.<p>There's even the possibility that some allied economies (Germany?, France?) would probably refuse to help, as the balance of economy tips in their favor, while US markets tank.<p>Wars are not only resolved with bullets today.",1341110346

Infrastructure costs will more than double ...</i><p>is mercifully untrue in the majority of cases.<p>Why? Because unless the major component of your infrastructure cost is storage, or your Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is zero, then database log shipping and bulk data sync to another region isn't all that expensive.<p>The author may be assuming that you'd need to have the VMs ready to go at the standby region.  This isn't true, not when you can boot a large application cluster and promote/upgrade a database replica in minutes.  For the majority of businesses, a realistic Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is on the order of minutes to hours, so this is fine.<p>I built this recently. A booking system for an airline.

In all seriousness though, we should take startup advice with a grain of salt but at the same time realize that while most of it is contradictory that doesn't mean it's all worthless. The trick is to pick out what applies to your particular situation. If there are two conflicting pieces of advice that apply then you just go with your gut. Only you know what's best for your situation. It's always useful to learn what others think or have gone through. So yeah, it's all a bunch of feel-good contradictory stuff but it still has its worth. You can compare it to self-help which is often worthless but even then at least self-help gets you moving toward bettering your situation just like startup advice.

Initially the practice was quite benign because many experiments indeed require expensive instruments and knowledge of some quite specialized skills, however, this practice was kept unchecked (there is no real penalty of any sort how many authors you add to the paper, except that some authors themselves may object to having to share credit), which allowed for cliques to become established where you basically have a few ""friends"", and you try to add those friends to every paper you publish for some very minor help/advice they offer, and your friends in turn try to add you to every paper they publish for very minor help/advice from you.

This is conceptually similar to a server-side CNAME. The reason these don't have TTL is because users don't see them.<p>The returned record, of course, has a TTL, and the ALIAS mechanism will not alter the TTL of the aliased data, so in the case of an ELB you are talking a TTL of one hour. There are no magic bullets to the distributed cache expiration problem.<p>(The other comments in this article about TTL seem quite confused, though, so this explanation might not actually have helped. Even if you have a 20-year TTL, you are going to see changes immediately from clients that do not have the data cached anywhere on their path to the origin.)<p>(In particular, there is no difference at all to switching the ALIAS record out for an A record with regards to your TTL: if the user has the target of the old mapping cached they will use it, otherwise they will get the new one.
