I've yet to see software that can come close to this, and even those that sort of do involve a bit of overhead vs just walking into an empty conference room.<p>2) Debugging/working through things on someone else's machine<p>Sometimes you can solve a problem or work through some design much more quickly by just sitting down at a computer with someone and walking through the code. This is certainly possible to do remotely, but it always feels a lot more clunky, and I tend to avoid it.<p>3) Office talk<p>Not office gossip, but simply overhearing co-workers talking about something and either learning something or offering them a better way to do it. This adds happens fairly frequently in my experience, and it is hard to duplicate remotely.<p>Sure, if you have everyone working remotely, you can invest time to figure out ways to mitigate these losses, but if it is just one or two people working from home full-time, I think either way you are adding less net value than if you were there in person, all else being equal.",1341543477

That is, less than one drug that ever entered formal testing in animals, ever made it to market.  Note, all the work done up to the point of testing it in animals is a tiny fraction of the overall cost of getting a drug approved.<p>So combine those two issues.  You have an investment that requires huge amounts of capital, typically in the several hundred million dollar range (to get a drug approved).  You also have a very low chance of a positive result.  What does this mean when you are trying to raise capital?  A very large pay out.<p>If you reduced the return on this investment by 80%+ (which is what you'd do if you added a 5 to 10% royalty to the current generic prices), you'd have all that capital moving to investments with much better risk/return profiles.<p>I don't have the source available, but I remember reading that of the drug that are approved, only 1/3 of them actually ever make a profit for the company overall.

Two sides of the spectrum:<p>1) I've noticed that of all the remote positions in various departments, marketing is the one that is almost always co-lo. They tend to have the most say in product direction (duh) and in turn strategic, company-wide policy changes.<p>2) Sales is the counter-example here. I've seen talented remote sales people rapidly and deservedly climb the corporate ladder. However, the catch is that they tend to have brutal travel schedules (which they'd probably have anyway if they were in corporate HQ), so it's arguable whether they are reaping the same benefits of working from home as other remote workers.",1341541675

A site like AirBnB can connect people to places that are somewhat alternative, yet desirable locations: think Williamsburg, Wicker Park, etc..but adding experiences such as adding Free Parking, tickets to a play, or a prix fixe dinner in to a package you can purchase with one click seems to be a good value add on top of the accommodations.<p>Sites like Orbitz will recommend things, but usually AFTER you have already expressed interest in your hotel and destination.  And Jetsetter has some very interesting deals but I don't think the average couple/family can just go on a 7 night expedition milking their own goat milk and doing yoga on the mountain tops of Nepal or whatever experience they're pushing.

The current state of the American patent system stagnates society on multiple levels:<p>1) Patents, in too many cases, are a prohibitive barrier to entry for entrepreneurs. We have a system in which entrepreneurs know that if an adequately wealthy corporation were to knowingly file frivolous patent lawsuit, the cost, time, and energy to defend such a lawsuit could threaten the life of a fledgling business. Such a system can only have a chilling effect on entrepreneurship and economic growth. Trying to improve the world should -not- feel like walking on a minefield, and until that is fixed, our economy is not receiving the full benefit of its entrepreneurs.<p>2) Another inventor may be able to use a patented idea as a component for a broader, more useful (patentable) idea. A patent holder should not be able to prevent the development of innovations based upon their own.<p>3) In many cases, the inventor is not the best producer of his own invention. Society, as a whole, is best off when the best inventions can be produced by the most capable producers, and a patent holder should never be able to prevent this optimal economic arrangement.<p>American society generally values creativity far more than productivity, as reflected not only in its patent system, but in its popular culture, heroes of industry, etc. But in terms the health and sustainability of society, and economic output, productivity is at least as important. If Americans don't collectively acknowledge this, broader economic, and ultimately geopolitical, consequences will continue.<p>As a minimal solution to reverse these trends, I would suggest that patent holders be stripped of the ability to prevent others from being able to use their ideas in a product, but should be able to retain the ability to charge reasonable royalties. Thus, our society may be able to approach a healthier balance between its need for innovation and production.",1341541482

The problem is that patents are being granted for lowest-bar ""innovations"", which are leading to these cases by companies that are merely using it as yet another competition tactic. In tech we're seeing patent cases are over trivial, often minor, features which others can accidentally infringe upon without noticing.<p>Pharma is a different beast, it's much more difficult to have a low-bar pharmaceutical, usually by the time the work is done the medication far exceeds the threshold of patentability. (Patent exploitation does still happen, as others have pointed out with insincere drug enhancements.) It's not about regulating specific industries(which would be exploited), but rather about raising the bar on what is indeed an original invention.<p>The blame for this mess lay on the USPTO. The patent system is being run like a commercial entity. A granted patent will attract over $5,000 in fees to USPTO, a rejected patent will only garner $125, with much of the granted fees attributed to curiously undefined 'maintenance' cost.<p><a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/inventors/patents.jsp#heading-6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/inventors/patents.jsp#heading-6</a>",1341541247
