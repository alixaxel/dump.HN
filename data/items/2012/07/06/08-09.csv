There can be less interuptions at home, there's less time wasted on commuting, and more flexibility - allowing (for instance) people with children to have a better work/life balance, which should hopefully make them more effective workers.<p>There's also things like the simple cost of the building - if 20% of your staff are typically at home on any given day, you need 20% less floorspace etc (I know it's not quite that simplisticaly linear, but you get the point).<p>For meetings, things like Facetime can be remarkably effective at getting someone ""in the room"" when they are physically at home. It's not quite as good as them actually being there, but it's remarkably close.<p>Obviously there's a balance. There are quite definitely upsides to having people in the building - a quick 2 minute chat at someone's desk with a piece of paper and a pencil can sometimes be as effective as a Visio diagram and an email that took an hour to write, and even more importantly having people sat right next to you can make working far more collaborative.<p>But depending on what your job is, having the flexibility to work for a day or more a week at home can be hugely valuable.",1341564965

The bad news is that at least 37,000 Americans still die on the USAs roads and highways each year, and almost all of them die due to persistent and, in some ways, increasing driver errors. Indeed, drivers are the most vital variable in car wrecks and other traffic accidents  not weather, defective parts or road conditions. Though such reasons and many others do arise in wrecks, most collisions continue to be due to drivers who  quite simply  make a momentary but lasting mistake.

Coding up to the 80s or the early 90s tended to be about squeezing the absolute most capability you can from the machine. Clarity and conciseness probably took the back seat to optimization hacks, so writing the comment to describe the original intent of the code actually was vital.<p>Peter Norvig's old Lisp programming book has a nice illustration on how the programming style in Lisp has evolved from the 70s to the book's 1992: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=QzGuHnDhvZIC&lpg=PP1&dq=paradigms%20of%20artificial%20intelligence&pg=PA30"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=QzGuHnDhvZIC&lpg=PP1&#3...</a><p>SICP also had the ""programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute"" quip, and also notes ""In this book we don't use many comments; we try to make our programs self-documenting by using descriptive names.""<p>Since the 90s, programmers have had a bit more breathing room, and the idea to actually write the code itself so that it will concisely describe what it's doing when read by a competent programmer has become much easier. You still want to document nontrivial interfaces, tricky things from the application problem domain and problem workarounds in the code, but the actual business-as-usual code tends to be readable and idiomatic enough that you don't need to comment every function, method and variable. Most can be inferred well enough from context.",1341562966

You are obviously keen to write good quality code in a modern-ish framework/paradigm.<p>---<p>You have to realise that the company you are working for now might be suffering from industrial inertia - also, unless you are privvy to their financials, you probably have no idea of any pressure they are under to make ends meet. In general, selling something that you've already sunk costs into is more cost-effective than writing something new and then selling it, so if their primary objective at the moment is to make money and they have a system that is working, they will probably keep pushing it. It is rare, though not unheard of, for a company to be so developer focussed that they will undertake a wholesale refactor of their code base if it is currently bringing home the bacon. Also in something very old and convoluted (as you've said pull on one part and another part will collapse), refactoring is often less time-efficient than simply writing it from scratch. Ask yourself ""if I manage to refactor this into a best-of-breed code, will I be enjoy putting the time and effort into it on a daily basis? or will it just be an albatross around my neck every morning until it is done?""<p>Consider your goals - you could consider staying at the company and learning about the business end (i.e. actually selling the software), maybe make some valuable contacts - that's a good goal but it might not be the right goal for you. If you currently just want to write beautiful code, then find somewhere else to work - perhaps a more greenfield development without legacy code.<p>edit to add a potentially relevant link on stackexchange that i've just come across:\n<a href=""http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/155488/ive-inherited-200k-lines-of-spaghetti-code-what-now"" rel=""nofollow"">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/155488/ive-in...</a>",1341562796
