Its build quality is much better than other laptops.<p>- Good keyboard. Very important for me as it is my main machine for coding. I like the keyboard better than many full sized ones.<p>- 4:3 aspect ratio, 1400x1050 non-glare screen (can fit more vertical code).<p>- Trackpoint device (the ""nipple"" as some call it). I never liked trackpads (but it has that too, I just disabled it).<p>Recently my kid tore out some keys off of the keyboard, I started to ran out of disk space on its old 60GB hard drive, and my fan got kind of loud. I considered buying another machine. Looked around. But the more I looked, the more I realized that I just wanted this machine. So I got a 500GB hybrid Seagate Momentus drive, a new fan and a new keyboard. Spent an evening upgrading it and now I am hoping to get more years out of it.<p>Opening it, it just confirmed the build quality. The components inside, the materials used just seems better than in equivalent HP and Dell laptops I had to take apart.",1342666735

4264186,comment,4261813,4264028,1,0,rogerbinns,,,"Presumably the ""surprise me"" would mean a random selection of the offerings rather than something not on the visible list?  Americans are very fussy with their food so not knowing what it is until it arrives at your door may be going too far.  But from a UX perspective I think that is shirking your responsibility to make the meals interesting.<p>You can certainly gamify things, and also take inspiration from the humour of Woot.  For example bingo cards where you try to have meals covering the whole alphabet, or colours.  Or ""World Tours"" where there are sequences of recipes that trace a path geographically around the world.  Or voting certain ingredients off the ""island"".  Or pick a film/TV show and make what the characters eat (or inspired by what they eat, or their locations).  The Once Upon A Time In Mexico DVD has a 10 minute short on it showing how to make puerco pebil that I've done several times.<p>Here for example are the Indiana Jones locations:  <a href=""http://indianajones.wikia.com/wiki/Travel_with_Indy:_Locations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indianajones.wikia.com/wiki/Travel_with_Indy:_Locatio...</a><p>Out of that you'd get South America, France, Egypt, UK, India, Spain, Venice, Jordan and the US Southwest.

I spent few months with a very hardworking person but I didn't really start following in his footsteps until after 3 months.
