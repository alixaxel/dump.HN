It doesn't matter if they bought it legitimately as they'd still be infringing - in the same way the MPAA can claim that your download of a torrent of a movie [made by employees of one of the companies it represents] is infringing despite the torrent site not having informed you that it's not a legally acquired work.<p>If the argument ""we didn't know"" works for them then surely that sets precedent for everyone else. If it doesn't work then damages of 10 for every instance of infringement of the work would seem reasonable. That's for every DVD they make with it on, for every showing in a movie theater, for every use in advertising ...<p>though it looks like the MPAA have already set a damage level of $30k per instances [TorrentSpy case as reported at arstechnica]. Now last week the top ten selling movies [which may not be all MPAA ones of course, nor carry the infringed work, but this is just for scale] had sold collectively about 15 million units in the US. From that I'd expect damages of the order of 30k * 10 * 15M = 4.5 trillion, or 25 years of the MPAA's total revenue [as reported on their website] to be reasonable. /tongueincheek",1343015457

It is identical to ""If banks can't compete with counterfeiters and Robin Hood who give out cash for free, they can't compete, period."" Never mind that counterfeiters and Robin Hood are not actually creating any value or the products which they then ""give away"".<p>In the waffle case it's different since they were personally making the waffles and spending the money to give them away. This should not have been interfered with. But, like western food dumping aid to Africa, it's not a sustainable ""business model"", and has the side effect of destroying actual sustainable businesses that actually create the products. Even so though, it should be allowed if both parties permit it. In the case of food aid where it is paid for with tax funds and is primarily a system of price supports to large corporations like ADM, it is problematic because natural economic forces don't come into play. A government with tax authority can dump wheat surpluses into Africa on a random schedule, creating chaos and starvation indefinitely by destroying local agricultural markets. This is bad. A private organization like the Pirate Party or Knights of Columbus or Greenpeace or whatever won't be give out free waffles indefinitely as long as it is funded by themselves, and so any negative effects eventually work themselves out and should not be interfered with legally.",1343013508
