Should mental stability be a factor in survival in space I can imagine that it'll introduce a rather strong darwinistic filter. It's difficult to fathom but realistic that folks with a short fuse have a severe disadvantage. Would it be required to undergo a psychiatric test before you can buy a ticket to an off-world colony and settle? Will people with a genetic predisposition be advised not to have kids? Will earth be a safe-haven for loonies?",1341651598

4211169,comment,4176075,4200796,1,0,wvenable,,,"> PHP is easy to deploy, as if that's an inherent property of PHP and not something that can be fixed for other languages.<p>Other languages can fix that (they haven't yet) but at the same time PHP is fixing it's problems at a rapid pace.  It seems that PHP is making more progress fixing it's problems and including modern features than other languages are improving their deployment situation.<p>One advantage of PHP, in my opinion, is that it supports multiple levels of commitment.  I recently created a static website for my business; I didn't want the hassle of using a CMS or Wordpress.  But I used PHP to include the common headers and footers and handle my contact form.  In any other web platform (including PHP with a framework) is terrible overkill for a job like that.  But if I want to do something more significant in the future, I can.<p>PHP's work cycle is also great; if done right you should have no build step.  Just edit and hit refresh.  I'm currently doing ASP.NET and it's just not possible to iterate as fast during development.<p>But honestly, I've used a lot of different platforms and PHP just isn't that different.  Why choose PHP over all your other options?  If your goal is distribution of your app then you can't go wrong with PHP because it's installed everywhere.  And, depending on your language experience, you might be more comfortable in PHP because it's very literal; there's no monkey patching or heavy use of dynamic features.  But really, there's no reason not use Ruby or Python over PHP.",1341651541

This in itself gives one type of businesses at least a good way to generate income; 3D content creators.<p>The other side of SL are the very large groups of people that play the game to indulge in some sort of alternative fantasy. There are massive populations of furries, Goreans, BDSM practitioners and so on, who again are usually quite willing to pay for content for use in role playing in the virtual world.<p>I originally joined because I was interested in the technology side of things (I read an article somewhere about players using the in-game scripting systems to create 'virus objects' which spread across the world, which I thought was interesting enough to merit checking out) but I stayed because I found I had inadvertently formed a group of friends, and I even ended up getting engaged (in reality) to somebody I met there.<p>In a sense, Second Life has thrived, but not as a clean, bright new frontier as originally intended, but instead as a kind of collaborative roleplaying framework for people whose tastes are not really catered for anywhere else.",1341650830

4211151,comment,4210896,4210896,7,0,pixie_,,,"At the moment SecondLife is miles of empty houses, casinos, and furries, it's pretty sad, but salvageable.  First there needs to be zones with something like property taxes based on foot traffic over an area. This would incentivize change, and renovation of an area instead of static dead content that persists forever. Next the viewer client needs to be scaled down a bit. SecondLife is very much ahead of its time (advanced 3d modeling, advanced scripting of objects) the result is a lagged experience. Wonder why Minecraft took off? It's because building in Minecraft is simple, in SecondLife building is a pain in the ass. Again - way too advanced, no simple options for people. Anyways I hope someone eventually gets it right because SecondLife made the same mistakes AlphaWorld did and is meeting a similar fate.

4211150,comment,4209384,4210182,1,0,jono_x,,,"> But if you argue against the principle of rapid release, then you can't say in the same breath that users are leaving one rapid release browser (Firefox) for another (Chrome).<p>Hi Azakai,<p>Paradoxical it may be, but this is exactly what I have observed: people leaving Firefox for Chrome and citing dislike of rapid updates as the main reason. Not just the intrusiveness of the update mechanism, but the breakage of compatibility and UI habituation are also cited as reasons.<p>Yes, these problems exist in Chrome as well as Firefox. It's just that users aren't noticing them as much in Chrome. Probably because, as new Chrome users, they don't yet have UI habituation and they don't yet have a workflow that depends on specific add-ons or other fragile compatibility issues.<p>Maybe if they stay on Chrome for long enough they will realize that the same problems exist there. But they're the sort of problems you don't encounter right away as a new user of a browser.<p>So yes, fixing the experience of the update itself is the highest priority since that's the number one thing that was driving people away. I know the Firefox team has been working hard on fixing this and the updates are much smoother now (especially since Firefox 12 got rid of the Windows UAC warnings.) That's great!<p>However, I predict that in the long term there will continue to be problems in both Firefox and Chrome caused by automatic updates breaking UI habituation, compatibility, or low-frequency use cases that particular users depended on.<p>Software that's as important as a web browser really ought to offer users an option to get just security/performance updates without any other changes. (Mozilla does offer Firefox ESR, but they don't publicize it and they discourage non-enterprise users from downloading it.)",1341650589

Everyone I know that hates Perl had some sort of experience where they inherited some legacy Perl script that broke all the time and yet performed business critical functions.  I started my first full-time job in 2004, and whenever I get together with my old co-workers we'll STILL talk about the battle scars we had trying to bubble gum and tape together a particular script called cc_processing.pl (yep, just as critical as the name implies), that seemingly broke every other day and went so far down the rabbit hole you had no idea how it ever ran successfully.  $a{$a} = $a->{$a}?  Sure, why not.<p>I wonder how much of Perl's reputation is based on these kinds of formative experiences.  I love Perl, but I'm realizing that everyone had their nemesis in sitecounts.pl, or traffic_reports.pl, or partnerpayments.pl, or wtf-how-did-this-ever-work.pl, and unfortunately didn't draw the same conclusions about Perl that I did.",1341650579

Usually you have your shipped code and your development code, and you want to be at least able to ship a security fix without disclosing your new functionality.\nConcerning your last point, if you don't like that you are probably at the wrong place for web developments, where you should at least support a dozen different browsers.

4211090,comment,4210635,4210781,4,0,einhverfr,,,"I was recently playing around with modelling business growth using logistic equations, and I came upon a possible reason why large companies are unable to be nimble and dynamic in the way small companies are.<p>Note: The basic logistic equation is 1/(1 + e^-t) which one can extend to be S = M / (1 + e ^ (-rt-y)) where M is the maximum growth capacity, r is growth rate, y is number of years to the 50% mark.  Anyway, it produces nice S-shaped growth curves that generally approximate growth in a limited environment.<p>Anyway working with these a few things occurred to me.  Near the bottom of the growth curve, growth is very slow.  It then picks up suddenly, grows to a certain point, then growth rate declines and the market size tapers off.  Lack of immediate success along these curves may be due to a growth rate that is too low or a market size that is too small (duh) but when we vary both maximum size (M) and growth rate (r) something really interesting happens.<p>If we have a curve that successfully predicts two or three years of growth but then overperforms what we observe, this has exactly two causes:  Either M is much bigger than expected <i>and</i> r is much smaller (meaning smaller growth now but much more growth later), or M is much smaller and y is much bigger (meaning the market is already saturated).  You can't differentiate these just looking at how a project is performing.<p>A small business can bet against the short term and for the future.  A larger, publicly held business is often less able to do so, so getting over the slow growth in the lead-in of the logistic sigmoid is really tough in a larger corporate environment.  This is probably a good part of the reason why big companies have a much harder time innovating.",1341648457
