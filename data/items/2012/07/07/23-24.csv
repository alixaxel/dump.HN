Annual profits for Barclays were 5.9 billion to Q1 this year. May not be appropriate for comparison purposes, but if over a year the financial penalty Barclay's paid was the same basis as the penalty for dodging a 2 tube fare in central london - the fine for being caught would be just south of a whopping 10 pence!  Simple incentive theory here.  At that rate I'd dodge the fare every. single. day. The fine (reputation damage be damned as I'm not sure there is a honest broker to take my business to) is off by at least 2 orders of magnitude.",1341705500

This makes sense.<p>However, the way the methods are connected appears to be the uiActions attribute of the view object, which seems unnecessarily tight coupling between the controller and view. Also, the example code makes the view code responsible for querying the form, when it seems this should be the responsibility of the controller.<p>For some reason I still have a gut feeling that the view/controller split can allow generic views with custom controllers or generic controllers with custom views, but in the real world it seems the view/controller separation is still extremely fuzzy.<p>Morphic, the ui framework used by squeak, does away with the controller concept, leaving input handling up to the Morph (view) which is an interesting data point.",1341705435

There's literally no way to include anything but grades in your admission application -- not even recommendation letters. I've talked to some of the admissions faculty, and their argument is that it's unfair to people who are totally new to computer science to deny them on the basis of a lack of prior experience. I totally disagree with this, however -- you're not going to get into a music or acting program without any prior experience, why should you get into a CS program?<p>From what I've seen, a lot of UW graduates end up getting recruited into a big company (Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Intel, etc). It's by all means a great program, but it seems like they're never going to have someone they can point to as a success like, for example, Harvard, Stanford, or MIT. I think that's the reason why their reputation is a lot more quiet.<p>FWIW, my co-founder and I have both been rejected from UW CSE (me with an overall 3.8 GPA and several conference papers published as first author while I was still in high school).",1341705133

Software development exists here primarily to facilitate stuff being pulled from the ground.<p>Have you considered using .net for your startup? There is the obvious drawback of having to license the Microsoft stack, but ASP MVC is now mature enough to being a solid backend platform for a startup, and your odds at finding a talented .net developer in Alberta are magnitudes greater than the platforms hyped in Silicon Valley. The BizSpark program also gives you a 3 year free run at MS licensing.<p>As an experienced contractor in the Calgary area, I'd go as far as saying the Oil & Gas has created a large surplus of .net developers especially in the last 3 years, which explains the booming IT headhunting sector here, and hiring capable developers seems to take only a handful of days from start to finish.",1341704821

What I discovered was that the role of the controller in smalltalk was to <i>poll the mouse and keyboard</i> in a tight loop. When I wrote webmvc (which became woven, which became nevow) I found, as I think many people have found, that the controller doesn't really have as much of a place on the web, and nevow ended up not really having controllers associated with views but rather the logic associated with a controller was placed in methods on the Page object.<p>I'm curious what role the controller objects play here.",1341704586

It does spend CPU cycles trying to figure out what isn't needed, so your claim that it doesn't ""waste CPU cycles"" is not true. Its advantages over tracing GC are that memory can be reclaimed promptly, that it does a pretty good job of spreading out the CPU load in an incremental sense, and that it's simple to implement and reason about. The big downside is cycles; lots of large reference-counted codebases constantly struggle with cycles (for example, Firefox). Adding cycle detection to a reference counted system is not easy to do in a performant way and almost nobody that I'm aware of but Firefox even attempts to do it.<p>Without unsafe memory management, you can still do pointer arithmetic.

I can elaborate more if you like but whilst I understand PHP can be used in an effective way in the hands of someone that understands all the nuance, and I <i>know</i> that PHP enables people to start hammering stuff out with ease, it also enables people that don't know the nuances of the language to write utterly shit code that people like me have to deal with for ages on out.

If your tests and good and coverage is high, there's far less chance I should ever even have to muck around inside your libraries, much less modify them.<p>And again, one doesn't preclude the other, but I see so many people making a bit stink over style - tabs vs spaces et al years before the PSR stuff - yet rarely do I see even 20% of that effort spent on getting people to test.<p>I say this not as someone who tests everything 100%, but as someone who doesn't do much of it, and understands the importance of it.

Most companies will never need to do the same level of computation that Google needs to do.<p>The fact is, Hadoop is becoming more and more easy to setup, with distributions like Cloudera & Hortonworks allowing users to set up clusters with minimal upfront knowledge of Hadoop and how it works. The article uses HBase and Hive together in the same sentence which is kind of weird, Hive and HBase are completely different. Hive was made by Facebook to allow users to map schemas to a large set of files so their employees could run MapReduce jobs without Java knowledge, but instead SQL (HSQL)...basically a way to bridge the gap between Hadoop and non-java / programmers. HBase is a different beast all together and has no relation to MapReduce...the only thing it has in common with Hadoop is that it uses HDFS as its underlying FS (but doesn't have to). It's a NoSQL database that is modeled after BigTable (K -> V) and is pretty complicated...more so than just Hadoop/MR.<p>I think Hadoop will be around for quite a while, especially since it's becoming almost trivial to deploy.

Listen, we have already established you are the kind of person that goes around pretending to discredit an entire branch of economics without having the slightest clue about what that branch even claims to say. Fine. But repeating the same nonsense after being told that it is nonsense is just too much. The entire freaking idea revolves around how <i>individual</i> labor which under capitalism is done by private initiative is converted to <i>social</i> labor, which is through market mechanics accepted as socially necessary. <i>Of course</i> that whether or not that labor was in fact desired, has some value for society, is a factor, and that is a fundamental aspect of the LTV. The Wikipedia article explains this, the article I linked to explains it, I explained earlier that value under the LTV is realized at the point of <i>sale</i>, ie, when someone actually goes through and establishes the usefulness of the labor invested by exchanging something (usually money) for it.<p>The rest of your post conflates price with value, which are different things according to Marxian thought, so again it is pretty useless as far as ""debunking Marx"" goes.
