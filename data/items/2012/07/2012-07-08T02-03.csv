If prices are determined adversarially, then there is no room for manipulation or conflict of interest.  Why have these indexes at all?<p>Put another way, who is willing to buy or sell according to prices that are open to manipulation (by being pegged to something like LIBOR), and why are they willing to do this?  And why shouldn't competition favor produce better alternatives like financial instruments that aren't pegged to any artificial index?",1341716348

Unfortunately, having been thoroughly spoiled by managed memory and strong typing, I break out in hives at the thought of undertaking an extensive project in C or C++.<p>So what are some good languages for this? D is interesting, but I'm a bit turned off by its lack of support for concurrency. Haskell can theoretically work in this domain, but it appears that it's quite difficult to reason about its performance without an inordinate level of understanding of its implementation details.

   |- Says we should make other languages fill in on what PHP does best
   |- Post goes on HN
      |- PHP apologists say ""No! PHP is fine, I've made a career out of it!""
      |- 'Atwoodians' continue to reject PHP, ruby/python need to be more accessible
      |- PHP apologists make reasonable arguments for why PHP isn't as bad as everyone says, while admitting its probably worse than python/ruby

There remains a conspicuous lack of response from the 'Atwoodian' camp regarding what could be done to add PHP's quick-start strengths to other languages so that PHP developers can develop similarly to how they currently do, just with a less wonky and problematic base language.<p>By no means, as an outsider, do I perceive the PHP apologists as having redeemed PHP to the point that the discussion should be about 'how to fix PHP' rather than 'how to discourage its propagation' as was originally put fourth in a fairly reasonable way by Atwood.<p>I realize why saying 'PHP apologists' is problematic, but I'm mostly seeing responses that are in themselves critical of PHP, while espousing its widespread use, quick-start capabilities, and developer intertia--and not espousing why the fundamentals of the language are better of the equals of ruby/python.",1341715623

The bank isn't assuming it can keep your deposit for any length of time; instead, it's assuming that in aggregate over all its depositors a certain amount of money will be left on deposit at any given time.  Obviously this assumption goes out the window if the depositors act together to remove their deposits - as long as they don't, the system is in equilibrium (it's not rational to withdraw your deposit and forego the interest).  As soon as the equilibrium is disturbed and a run starts though, the risk increases sharply and it becomes rational to withdraw your deposit.
