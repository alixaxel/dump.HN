4201451,comment,4199917,4201324,3,0,lobster_johnson,,,"Go 1.0.2, which is the newest stable release. I will see if I have some extra time to file a report.<p>Slightly off topic (but relevant to my comment above), do you know why this:<p><pre><code>    func TraverseInline() {
      var ints := make([]int, N)
      for i := range ints {
        sum += i
      }
    }
</code></pre>
should be slower than:<p><pre><code>    func TraverseArray(ints []int) int {
      sum := 0
      for i := range ints {
        sum += i
      }
      return sum
    }

    func TraverseWithFunc() {
      var ints := make([]int, N)
      sum := TraverseArray(ints)
    }
</code></pre>
Seeing a huge difference here. With an array of 300000000 ints, TraverseInline() takes about 750ms, whereas TraverseWithFunc() takes 394ms. With gccgo (GCC 4.7.1), the different is much slighter, but there's still a difference: 196ms compared to 172ms. (These are best-case figures, I'm doing lots of loops.) Go is compiled, not JIT, so I don't see why a function should offer better performance.",1341453451

1) There were no alternatives when it was launched, eg Western Union.  The best way to send money home to your family was literally to trust it to a bus driver, you can imagine how well that worked
2) The regulators were very 'soft' touch and allowed Vodaphone to launch a service which was illegal in many other countries (for money laundering reasons)
3) Vodaphone had an 80-90% market share in most segments, this prevented the 'cross-network' problem<p>I believe that until android (or other) smartphones become affordable to poor people, freeing innovation from the carriers, we won't see M-Pesa's success get replicated around the world.

The basic setup is going to be 'hello, world' in various languages.<p>I've already picked a small set of esoterics to throw in there more as comic relief ('piet' in Piet is definitely nice, for example), but I'm trying to find short but profound snippets in various languages. So far I have:<p>* Java: ""Hello, World"".toCharArray().each(c -> System.out.print(c)); <--- these are java 8 closures, and would let me expand on how java closures in java 8 require a single interface type with 1 method to match, which then in turn lets you omit the type of the parameters. Closures without first-class functions.<p>* Fortress: Turn ""Hello, World!"" into a conclist, then print the list as 'self, left, right', which produces something like "" lHeol,loWrd!"" reliably. Explain what makes conclists so interesting from a parallelizing perspective. Take-away lesson: Conc lists; how anything with accumulators is not practically parallelizable, and that conslists are thus not that great, at least for parallelization purposes.<p>* Scala: turn hello world into a .par() list of characters then print those. Explain how at least in theory the output will be ""Hello, World!"" but with the string jumbled up non-deterministically. Take-away lesson: Parallelism can be that simple.<p>* ObjC or smalltalk: A random messagesend with colons in the method name to highlight this creative and somewhat unique way of providing named parameters. Take-away lesson: Sometimes weird design choices lead to elegant solutions.<p>* Javascript: Do something pretty profound using no actual alphanums anywhere - just wonky symbols. Explain how this was used to hack facebook at some point. Take-away lesson: Security is a heck of a lot harder than you think it is. Use deny-all with whitelists, not allow-all with blacklists.<p>.... but that's where I'm kind of stranded.
