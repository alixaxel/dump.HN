I would argue that it would be illegal for company B to scrape yellowpages.com for this information in order to make money without express permission from yellowpages.com.  However, if Company B found another way to access the same information (ex: scanning physical phonebooks or asking people to sign up to their site) then I'd say they're within the law.<p>Craigslist is 100% within their rights to control who accesses their service and how.

I also use it as a personal tool ( I used it to build it ).<p>2. Talk to people before deciding. I love asking people about their jobs in order to find new needs. My current project was born that way.<p>3. Pick something simple for your first project. You want to pick something doable.

Use deadlines, make compromises, and for the love of code, stick to them. I learned this the hard way. Decide and code. Rinse and repeat. Learn to live with your choices.<p>5.

There may be a very vocal minority in your circles but I don't see it in my travels. The only real question is how much of the warming is caused by humans and how much is part of a natural cycle. You did read the article right? This is part of a cycle. Perhaps there is some human influence on this cycle but how would the researchers know? Maybe in another 150 years when the ice sheet has already reformed and then begun to melt again repeating the cycle? Level heads are needed; not panic and politics.",1343174564

Assume the iPhone number is a blended number too between older and latest model. So did we just see the first real example of one phone model legitimately challenge the iPhone? The argument was always that Android success was across so many phones. Now is the breaking down? Please don't flame me as hater or fan boy and just help me with the question of whether this is meaningful or flawed.",1343174508

Maybe the ARC code. But also the wires. HN is the editorial process.<p>But I suggest that friends of free speech, and against government censorship, should adopt an expansive definition of 'speech' and 'press': everything that's part of the communication creation-delivery process.<p>Quibbling about definitions and analogies with regard to fundamental rights helps those who want to grow and abuse their power. The FCC does censor. It enforces wiretap requirements. It has, through licensing and ownership rules, created market concentration in other media industries, and preferentially rewarded politically-connected entities. Its board members and staffers are the same kind of congressional-staff/lobbyist/political-partisan lawyers who draft things like SOPA/PIPA for big donors.<p>Yes, I know there are federal shipping regulations too: and they're also unnecessary and abusive, benefiting large incumbents no matter their initial supposed pro-competition rationales. They are another example of how neutrality regulation will, no matter its initial form, be perverted over time by the political process.<p>Let Time-Warner or Verizon try such blatantly discriminatory policies. They will be ridiculed, consumers will choose other providers, a blossoming of circumvention technologies will arise. Bits are bits, the Internet works, and it doesn't need an overbearing big brother at the FCC to protect it from such trifling (and still almost entirely hypothetical) provider-meddling.",1343174503

Now it would be wonderful to understand the mechanism, we've only been watching via satellite for 30 years, so in another 150 years we'll have captured a full cycle on satellite and we will know a lot more.
