Otherwise water cooling (replacing the stock heat spreader) would get closer to LN2 runs. ALUs run at higher frequencies than the rest of the chip, but they're designed to do so (you'd have to shorten the gate pathways like a P4 to do that to the entire chip).<p>But ultimately, performance per watt is almost universally optimised for these days. It's critical in servers, laptops, mobile phones - The demand for 6ghz, 300W CPUs would be limited to workstation chips, even though we could probably engineer them to be reliable.<p>Power consumption is always going to increase super linearly with respect to frequency, probably as a fundamental property of any method of computation we use.",1341118731

I think the brogrammer culture is overstated, and women have taken down many male-dominated fields, opening them (and public opinion) to a better way.<p>Personally, I hope progamming is next in that queue, because I, for one, am <i>tired</i> of working with all white (and indian, and chinese) guys.",1341117993

Instead I'd say that the ability to hire great developers is a key advantage to being a smaller company.<p>Also, I'd say that the notions of ""10x"" or ""20x"" greater productivity from the best developers are set on the wrong footing entirely. Such ideas presuppose that development is just production work, when in reality it is highly creative. The advantage of good developers isn't just that they do what others would do but more efficiently, the advantage is that they do much more. Often times they expand your business. Quite often the genesis of a multi-million dollar product or services offering doesn't come from the top-down, conceived in management and merely implemented by the rank and file, but instead comes from the bottom-up, from a wacky idea that a developer has and rolls into a tech demo. Without great developers that's the sort of thing you miss out on.",1341116093

You bring up an interesting point and I'll answer it; however, I'd appreciate it if you returned the favor and gave me a straight-forward answer to my question.<p>Q: And how much was it that suppliers were being pushed by Apple into being 'innovative'?  Would anyone be producing laptop size retina panels if not for Apple's demand? How long would we have waited for retina laptops if we had to rely on HP, Dell, etc.?\nA:  I have no facts on this and probably only LG and Apple insiders really know.  If I had to guess I'd say: LG has been in the display business for decades and have had a long R&D program to research how to make better displays.  They (and other companies) figured out how to make very high-res displays at a cheaper price (i.e. they innovated).  LG then shopped the technology to several suppliers.  HP, Dell, etc. were interested but knew that such a product wasn't a good fit for their product mix and would be too expensive for their typical customer.  Apple saw the opportunity (kudos to them) and are able to command a premium price from consumers so they locked up a deal with LG.<p>Did Apple innovate?  Personally, I'd just say they saw a market opportunity and ran with it.<p>I guess the real point of difference here is how far we can/need/should stretch the word innovate.<p>To put a twist on your metahphor:  Your boss comes to you and says ""hey if you can make X go 10 times faster for 50% less, they'll sell like crazy""  You then spend a couple weeks figuring out how to achieve that goal.

But I think I see what you mean -- where do you throw random bits of stuff and how do you get it back?<p>I think in the sort of usage you're describing, you just make random things and save them, and you get them back with search and a chronological list. The three things you describe don't sound like you'll need them after, say, tomorrow afternoon. So why put a ton of effort into organizing them?<p>It is of course useful to be able to organize arbitrary files in a more permanent way. The repeated mistake (to me) is that the process of organization is not itself considered a concrete application based on specific use cases. For some reason, a document format is considered application-specific, but as soon as you want to group two documents together you're dropped into this pure universal abstraction of a filesystem hierarchy. In other words, applications get to define how files work, but not how folders work.<p>For example, you could have a ""project"" that let you group various things together (maybe some CAD drawings of an office remodel along with various random notes and a budget spreadsheet). That's what a folder does, but a project would be much more specific--maybe do some time tracking, have some client-based organizational functions, etc. And of course you'd look at projects in the project application, not in a filesystem debugger.",1341115763

Not Nitrogen. The difference matters here. Ethelyene gas is naturally produced by tomatoes and other fruits that ripen after picking. This gas catalyzes the ripening process. In nature, ripening happens relatively slowly because the gas is excreted into the open air. In a supermarket, this gas is given in much higher doses than would happen in nature, accelerating the ripening process. This turns the tomatoes red, but because it happens more quickly the sugars in the tomatoes don't have as much time to fully develop which is the main reason home-grown and ripened tomatoes can taste better.<p>However, as I explained this is still just an accelerated version of a natural process. You can do a smaller scale version by sticking your tomatoes in a paper bag with an apple (apples produce a lot of Ethelyene gas) for a couple days. The article is describing tomatoes that theoretically taste even better than home grown varieties, which still have similar genetic makeup to supermarket variety tomatoes.",1341115587
