4273797,comment,4273061,4273061,2,0,zaptheimpaler,,,"Frankly, this article annoys the hell out of me. Firstly, what trend is he talking about? He gave me two examples - Sparrow and QuickOffice. That's not a trend, thats two apps, and if there really is one, then that should've been made clearer.<p>Now, assuming this is a recurring trend, it still remains to be seen whether its one worth dealing with for Apple. Even if this kind of poaching happens, its likely that its on such a small scale that it makes almost no difference to the ecosystem of the app store. Basically, the assertion that ""Apple is depending on apps like Sparrow to make the iOS platform shine"" is backed by nothing.<p>If nothing else, the points about what Apple could do to help devs make more money are useful. Even in this case, I don't see why apple providing support for subscription fees is superior to letting the app creators handle that through online accounts. If the subscription part were handled by Apple, that just means more of a delay when the app makers want to change the structure/pricing of the subscription and even less control over the statistics that they can gather. The point about providing detailed statistics is great.<p>As achampas said, acquisitions and talent poaching is simply an economic reality, and a good one for developers because it gives them better economic prospects and more freedom in choosing their jobs.<p>Overall, a personal disappointment over the fact that Sparrow will no longer be under development is completely acceptable(""my favorite email application on both iOS and Mac OS""), but thats not a good reason to decide that some trend is bad and that it should be fixed.",1342839376

The ability to pause, rewind, play at 1.5x speed, etc. allowed me to take a break when I lost my focus, speed through the sections I already understood, slow down and repeat sections that didn't make sense at first, etc.  None of this is possible in a scheduled live lecture.<p>I wish I could have taken all of my college classes in this format, perhaps with the addition of 10-15 person lab sessions on campus.

This happens at lower bitrates than many people might imagine, IIRC v2 lame (~192kbps) has not been reliably identified, nor vorbis v6 (~160kbps).

Businesses need their customers to trust them and acquihires are making the entire community look bad.</i><p>Acquihiring is irrelevant. If anything, what's making the app developer community look bad are developers making promises they don't or can't keep.<p>It's simple: if you promise something, deliver it.<p>Know why Apple doesn't pre-announce features? Because announcements are promises, and nothing can be promised until it's done. Heck, even being as careful as they are, they've announced features that never shipped. At my company, we're extremely wary of pre-announcing anything when we interact with our users and, when we do, we go to lengths to emphasize that we can't promise anything until it ships.<p>To be clear, I'm not accusing Sparrow's team of willfully misleading, lying, or misrepresenting anything.

See [...] for plenty of counter-examples.<p>Hmm, the page of counterexamples you listed seems to be about making women feel ""sexy"" (it's on the ad for many of them), so it makes sense they would show ""sexy"" women, just like selling clothes and other items that would make men feel masculine would show buff men.<p>> As I mentioned earlier, advertising is not the only medium in which this sort of objectification is prevalent.<p>Hmm, which other media is it prevalent in that could display other qualities of a woman for the same purpose instead?<p>> Again, I don't think you can simply swap genders and call it a fair analogy.<p>I will concede that.<p>> When confronted with criticism, arguing that the subject at hand is not a big deal is defense, is it not?<p>I am not sure about this. ""It's right and you shouldn't be offended"" isn't the same as ""it's wrong for different reasons and isn't a big deal anyway"".<p>> It's actually not moot. I was interested in how you thought a woman might reacta question only you can answer.<p>Ah, okay. I answered that above, then.<p>> That's why I personally find it offensive. If you think women would be just as comfortable with this as men, then I would understand why you would not find it offensive.<p>I think this is the crux of the issue. I think women wouldn't have a problem with it, so that's why I don't have a problem with it. Maybe it's societal, though, as we can't assume the US technology sector culture is universal and the same as in other countries (I live in Greece).",1342836239

In this case, it's like someone who doesn't know OO at all asking why on Earth they'd want the Factory pattern. It isn't that I can't explain it <i>per se</i>, but no <i>satisfying</i> answer can be fit into an HN post. So I didn't try.<p>To forestall the ""copout"" accusation: Basically, being a monadic value means you get the full range of monadic programming constructs available to you while still being isolated by the type system, so you get isolation while still being able to do real work, and the STM system takes extensive advantage of the fact that the do syntax actually desugars into a long series of closures, which means it can do things like retry and choice and stuff in a natural, safe way.<p>But I am well aware that doesn't sound very impressive in isolation, because there's still a great deal of important nuance lost in that description, in much the same way that a similarly-detailed description of the factory pattern sounds generally unimpressive. (""What, it lets me either construct one thing or the other? Big whoop, here's how I do it in my procedural language, basically by just doing it. What's the big deal? Why does it make such a big fuss over something so simple?"" Which is a good question, if asked honestly, but a terrible argument, which is how it would usually be meant.)",1342836123
