One could imagine that VC partners early on may take issue with the idea of Github offering free services for open source projects for example. Before the network effect steps in, it'd just look like a foolish and idealistic idea. Essentially, VC funding may well accelerate your company but it's so early you have no clue if you're accelerating in the right direction.<p>By bootstrapping to such a successful point and then taking VC funding they're in far more control over how much money they receive and what percentage of equity they give up. The worst position to be bargaining from is a position of weakness -- having a self sufficient company puts them in control.<p>Bootstrapping lead to what appears to be very competitive terms from well known and respected VC partners[1].
