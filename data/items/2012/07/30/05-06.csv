Say for the people who are in universities and Govt. organizations doing physics and astronomy. However, I have no technical background(coding) for launching a good landing page which can collect email address from these niche groups. Also I have no business experience how to collect enough numbers of email address to start with. So here are my questions.<p>Q1. How should I set up a landing page to collect required information.Should I go with any landing page template off the shelf to test the idea or hire a freelance developer to do it?<p>Q2. How do I go out and collect large number of email addresses from a particular niche group?",1343627996

Suits at media companies have every incentive not to rock the boat, and so soften stories, or simply focus more effort on news that is unlikely to threaten ad revenue (ie, crime and celebrity news). Occasionally, this kind of self-censorship is blatant, like the infamous Fox/Monsanto milk hormone story, but usually the effect is subtle, like the warping of a gravitational field.<p>Admittedly, readers <i>do</i> create their own distortion effect on news, perhaps even bigger than advertisers. But since that's a factor either way, I still see reduced reliance on advertising as a positive trend in mass media.",1343627490

4311055,comment,4309186,4309186,2,0,nrmehta,,,"Thought-provoking post.  To me, one way to determine whether a system will have network effects or anti-network effects is to ascertain how much of its usage is driven by fashion versus utility.  Take email as an extreme example of the latter.  It's valuable because it's so universal - but it's not fashionable at all.  It's a pure utility.  So no anti-network effects (perhaps beyond spam but those are less about #s of participants as behavior).  I put Facebook in an intermediate category where it's transitioned reasonably well from fashion to a utility, though the folks that looked at it as fashion are now getting more turned off by it.  Indeed, the anti-network effect isn't simply about numbers - it's about who is coming into the network and a lost feeling of exclusivity (which honestly sometimes picks on very base human emotions) when the network grows with certain types of people.  I think twitter has moved further up the utility value chain than facebook has so I'd posit it's less vulnerable to anti-network effects (not to mention the asymmetric follow model that dalton talks about).",1343626493

None of the component ideas in the iPhone were 100% new, but it wasn't possible to build one at a consumer price-point until certain preconditions, both technological and economic, were met.<p>I'd claim this: marketing more than most disciplines lives or dies by the state of communication technology.  The best marketers in any generation know how to use that technology to their advantage.<p>But communication technology is radically different today than it was even 20 years ago, let alone 120 years ago when PT Barnum was alive.  For one, it's more digital and more technological.  It's also changing at an accelerating pace.  10 years ago neither Facebook nor YouTube existed.  6 years ago Twitter didn't.  Tumblr, 5.  Pinterest, 2.  Instagram, 1.<p>Or, think of it this way (as a marketer might): the rate at which new marketing channels are being created is accelerating.  We're talking channels that can potentially reach 1MM, 10MM, 100MM people sprouting afresh every year.

Once again, I stress the important of <i>guaranteed reserved block of time</i>.<p>As to the book itself, I am the most intrigued by very detailed descriptions of the character flaws of various people. Each person in the book serves to demonstrated a certain set of weakness of the character, framed in a suitable circumstance. In each one I recognize myself (and sometimes people around me), and this creates a strange feeling - on one hand it's somewhat disturbing and disgusting when laid so baren in front of me, on the other hand it's a relief to know I am not the only one to feel or do X/Y/Z. It's also humbling to know all these things were there 200 years ago...<p>So, in that sense I care about all of books characters. :)<p>Another thing is that you're probably overwhelmed by the sheer number of characters in the book, I know that I was. Concentrated reading makes it easier to remember most people, so that helps a bit. However when it's time to re-read the book I will probably take a piece of paper and write all characters and their relationships down.
