4211069,comment,4210635,4210635,2,0,einhverfr,,,"Interesting thoughts.  However for my business plan I have been looking at a bunch of other things and come to some other conclusions.<p>The first thing is, you can't build culture from the top-down and if you try hard enough you will look like Kim Jong Il.  That there is a corporate culture is automatic though and it arises from the everyday way people interact in a business.<p>In the first days of a business, the founders tend to be very flexible, willing to take on eachothers' roles as needed to some degree.  There aren't turf wars.  Just everyone working together to make the company great.<p>Then you hire more people and a problem develops.  People feel a need to quantify and control everything.  And so management develops.  What management really is there fore is to be a political filter which exists in between the employee and the executives and ensures that nobody takes proper risks.<p>My approach is going to be somewhat different.  First we are going with a relatively flat model inspired by WL Gore, Valve and Github, and where we have to add management and escalation, we make these as non-management-like as possible.<p>Our key values are likely to be openness, collaboration, collegiality, and entrepreneurship.<p>We will hire quality employees and get out of their way.<p>Executives will work side-by-side with employees on projects deemed to be of critical importance.  Leadership --- and followership --- will be distributed throughout the organization.<p>This all sounds great until one comes back to the culture issue.  Is it even possible to manage corporate culture as one climbs the logistic sigmoid?  Or does maturity bring habits?  In other words, is it true you can't teach an old dog new tricks?",1341647813

4211063,comment,4210666,4210988,4,0,cookiecaper,,,"The ""A class rates"" for developers rarely approach the <i>minimum rates</i> for legal services. The highest rate I've received from a consultancy was $200/hr, and they were working in an extremely specialized area with literally the best developers money could buy -- the only fundamental builders of that technology that weren't on board at that company were those who refuse to take a job. I know that Percona lists $300/hr as their rate, and we have the same story here; extremely specialized field, developers that are and have been deeply involved in the development of the technology for most of its lifetime. Generalized high-powered development help typically maxes out in the $100-$150/hr range, at least in my experience, and even that is difficult to get outside of California.<p>$250+/hr is the common baseline rate in my area for real commercial legal services (that is, more than emailing a template for a contract), <i>not</i> the ""A class rate"", and I would guess areas with higher cost of living are worse off. I have associates that pay $450-$500+/hr for their legal help. I know of lawyers that charge $750+/hr; that, you may say, is the ""A class"" rate for lawyership. Note the disparity between development consultancies and legal firms -- we max out <i>near a law firm's minimum rate</i>.<p>Comparison to other highly-skilled professionals, like developers, is indeed valuable, but only further demonstrates the exorbitance of legal pricing.",1341647521

We're excited to move forward to work with all our friends at Facebook. Part of this process includes closing down other products and services that we are no longer able to support, and this includes the Face.com developers API.<p>We are tremendous fans (and members) of the software development community and have always worked hard to offer interesting, innovative and easy-to-use developer tools. In return, tens of thousands of engineers have signed up for developer tokens to build face recognition products we could never have thought of ourselves. Interacting with and learning from the developer community has always been one of the best parts of working at Face. We're hoping to interact with you in the future as part of Facebook's developer network, and we want to thank you for your support and for using our services.<p>Over the next 30 days we will be shutting off our APIs and winding down all support. New signups for developer tokens are now closed. Some of you out there have built products, even whole businesses, that leverage or rely on our APIs. We want to do what we can to ease the challenges of this transition, so if you're going to need more than 30 days to figure out your next steps, please let us know here, and we'll do what we can to allow you more time to transition.<p>Many thanks once again for your loyal support and the creativity you've brought to Face.com.<p>Best wishes,

4211047,comment,4210666,4210869,4,0,cookiecaper,,,">The high rates that top lawyers get paid are simply market rates. We pay them too. Cheap lawyers are not a bargain.<p>I wasn't arguing that Google should've used cheaper lawyers -- I believe the costs across the entire legal industry are ridiculously inflated, for multiple reasons. Like health care, there are a lot of elements in play and it's hard to pin any single thing down and say ""this is the magic bullet"", even though, also like the medical industry, there are a handful of major, easily identifiable ""indecencies"" in the legal industry. Note also that one can say the current costs of medicine simply represent ""the current market rate"" and that these services are worth what people are paying for them (and in medicine, that's more likely to be true than legal services, though the exorbitance there isn't justified either).<p>By ""decency and propriety"", I guess I mean ""someone whose perspective is such that a fair analysis of the real value of the services provided by lawyers can be assessed"", i.e., from the perspective of a basic decent person. I understand this perspective can become foggy as one accustoms to the rates commonly charged by legal professionals, or worse, becomes a legal professional themselves, without necessarily losing decency in the general sense -- it is just that this person's ""decency gland"" (as it pertains to the price of lawyers) has been forced into submission in order to retain and/or provide a significant amount of legal services.<p>Yes, I think a ""proper rate"" for legal work would be less than the $250/hr <i>baseline</i> that all of the attorneys in my area charge, just as I think a proper rate for the stitch-up of a cut should be less than the $3,300 an uninsured friend was recently charged (for him, over a month of wages.

You cannot be represented in court by someone not certified by the bar. Lawyers are the only privately licensed group that receive this level of market protection; doctors are similarly protected, but it is by a governmental entity (and one might argue that it's in even worse shape because of it).<p>One could very easily argue that these barriers to entry lead to pricing pressure and artificial scarcity that has no direct relationship to the ""current market rate"".

This site [1] discusses apple's recycling, though since it isn't apple proper I'm not sure it's authoritative.  The relevant details appear to be:<p><pre><code>   Apple's recycler for non-Apple product recycling is WeRecycle!, a certified 
   e-Steward.  Certified e-Stewards are recyclers who have been audited by an 
   accredited auditor, and found to be conforming to the rigorous e-Stewards 
   standard.
   If you are using Apple's trade-in system, this is a different vendor, called 
   Power-On. Power-On is not an e-Steward (and they don't disclose their 
   recycling partner), so this trade-in program therefore does not benefit from 
   independent auditing to high standards.
   
   However, Apple has a very strong policy regarding responsible recycling of 
   e-waste, stating that all e-waste collected in their programs is handled in 
   the same region in which it is collected (and therefore not exported to 
   developing countries). They prohibit use of prison labor for recycling, as 
   well as incineration and landfilling of e-waste.
</code></pre>
So that sound reasonable, but it would be much better if there were a direct statement on Apple's site.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.electronicstakeback.com/how-to-recycle-electronics/manufacturer-takeback-programs/apples-takeback-program/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.electronicstakeback.com/how-to-recycle-electronic...</a>",1341646266

It just seemed like giant clunky desk to me.<p>One thing I do remember distinctly about Glenn's time in the catalog department was this terrifying 60k Perl script I inherited from him called sitecounts.pl.  This script examined all the various catalogs (books, reviews, etc) and attempted to generate some interesting stats about them.  One day it just broke, and since it was used in the catalog build process to verify that things were sane, it needed to get fixed pronto.  The code was plenty confusing, but what was the worst part was the extent of the right margin creep, I'm talking 150+ character lines -- not exactly easy reading on my crappy 15"" X-terminal.  I felt like a character in a HP Lovecraft story, slowly descending into madness as I learned more about the horrors of this script.<p>I ended up maintaining and adding to this script my entire first stint at Amazon.

Nearly two-thirds of all Mars missions have failed in some way, and yet these people are convinced they can simply put humans on Mars? Right.<p>You don't have to take my word for it, though. Take a look at what they say at their own site, and see if it actually makes sense. A few examples:<p>""In addition to this, the elements needed for a viable living system are already present on Mars, so we can keep the number of launches down. For example, the location Mars One has chosen contains water ice in the ground which can be extracted through heat and used to drink, bathe with, or used to feed crops, but can also be manipulated to create oxygen. Mars even has natural sources of nitrogen, another element of the air we breathe.""<p>And we will extract these resources how? We theoretically know how to build such systems, but that's not the same as actually being able to build them on Mars. Are they just going to experiment during the project, and if it doesn't work then ""oops, well, I guess you're all going to die""?<p>But, most ridiculously:
""Of course most of the elements we need are not yet exactly in the form we would like, but crucially: no brand new inventions have to be conceived, designed, tested and built for the mission to become reality.""<p>That's like saying we can also build a colony on Venus right now. Or Mercurius. Or Jupiter. Because we have a theoretical understanding of how to launch rockets there and how to build space colonies, and of course the technology to do both these things already exist. What these people fail to see is not that we don't have a theoretical understanding of how we <i>might</i> do all this, but that without any practical experiments in several areas AND many failed tests the chances of this project going perfectly as planned (which almost never happens to begin with) are VERY slim.<p></rant>",1341644608

Originally we though of directly copying files using NO_BUFFERING, but because the app was written in #C, it was a bit harder (and we didn't want to introduce insecurities). So the programmer in charge, just added one more Open/Close after the file was copied which was done with NO_BUFFERING - this purged the file from the cache.<p>Obviously not going to work, if instead of many sound banks, it was one huge taking all space.
