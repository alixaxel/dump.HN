If that is the case then Google+ just arrived at the wrong time.  No matter how good it is if the audience is losing interest in the whole concept it won't do well.  So the relative failure of Google+ might not indicate that Facebook is in a strong position, but that rather the whole ""social industry"" is in a weakening position.",1343455059

4304813,comment,4304018,4304480,2,0,robomartin,,,"> Believe it or not, the mainstream American audience wants to see egocentric American coverage - they enjoy it.<p>Probably true.  I hate it.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love to see how our athletes are doing.  I simply don't enjoy the cultural isolation and exclusionist coverage that our media pushes on us.  Here's an opportunity to learn about others and we get fed a typical short-attention-span American egocentric media diet.<p>This becomes very evident once you travel around the world, look back at the US and make some comparisons.<p>When it comes to the Olympics, World Cup or other events it is also particularly bothersome because the US is made-up of hundreds of cultures that have come together to adopt this nation.  This does not mean that Afgani-Americans or Chilean-Americans don't not want to see how the teams or athletes from their native soil are doing.  Events like the Olympic Games are opportunities to honor the many cultures that form this nation by, at the very least, providing reasonable exposure to their athletes and stories as well.<p>This is where online coverage could be so far ahead of typical network stuff.  You get to watch what you want.<p>Another thing that doesn't sit will with me is when accident reports go something like ""139 people, three Americans"".  OK, I get it, you are trying to tell our country that three of ours got lost in the accident.  However, for some reason, these reports always sound like they don't respect the rest of those lost in the accident.  I surely can't be the only one who feels this way.<p>Finally, why are NFL or NBA teams ""World Champions"" when the competition is national?",1343454251

Any of {A1,...,An} causes (all of them mutually disjoint) could have led to B. Now, you are aware of how likely each of these {A1,..,An} is of producing this B (this is P(B|A)). Bayes theorem allows you to use this information to deduce which {A1,...,An} is most likely to have been the cause given that B occurred (P(A|B)).<p>i.e. you use the Bayes theorem to reverse the conditional probability relationships given in the problem. The exact expression is now easily derivable using this idea and the total probability theorem.",1343454245
4304811,comment,4304165,4304165,11,0,b0sk,,,"The problem with many explanations is that people who write them have forgotten how it is to not know Bayes Theorem. Here is my humble attempt as to where people who want to grok Bayes theorem can start:<p>Imagine you have been locked inside a room. You are asked what the outside weather is. Assume you have to pick one of sunny, cloudy and rainy. You know it is July so you predict it is mostly sunny. (Because intuitively you know that the odds of ""sunny"" is more than the other two). [1]<p>Now you see that someone has entered the room carrying an umbrella. You are asked that question again. Of course you are going to update your answer based on the new information. Your previous odds calculation, while good, has to accommodate the umbrella factor -- a very solid piece of additional information. [2]<p>Before the umbrella happened all you knew was [1] and it is called Prior.\nAfter you saw the umbrella the odds are conditioned on the umbrella and it is called Posterior [2]. which is what you want. And you should definitely use your intuition about the weather too [1] which now goes to the right hand side of the equation.<p>So<p>Posterior = ( ) x Prior<p>This blank is called as Likelihood... it is the probability of umbrella given the weather.<p>Imagine you live in a place where the umbrella is used only during rain. So the likelihood of an umbrella given it is sunny is very very less and is going to make the product of Prior x Likelihood very less.<p>Whereas the likelihood of umbrella given it is rainy is almost certain. Even if your initial guess (prior) gives less odds to rain.. the product of likelihood x prior for rain is more than that of the previous paragraph product. You answer ""rainy""<p>Of course there is more to it and I suggest reading other great explanations in this thread.",1343454244

Asked in regards to political expression, I think it'd be hard to say that the equal protection in the US is anything but good. AFAIK we don't really have retaliatory crimes going uninvestigated. However, when we widen the scope to include things like government criminality, SLAPPs, copyright infringement, drug possession, and general sentencing it's pretty hard to say that parties of differing political/social/economic standing receive similar redress.<p>The freedom to help condone whichever big-money candidate sweet-talked me the best or to write in the name of someone who definitely won't be elected just isn't worth that much to me, especially when it fits into continuing the status quo oh-so-well. I'd probably miss it if it were gone, but as it stands I'd much rather have laws be understandable by everyone, and minimal penalties when they've not been violated (even when one ultimately prevails, time wasted by the system is a penalty itself).

Take the hypotheses to be ""is a woman"" and ""is not a woman""/""is a man"", and the data to be ""is over 6 foot tall"". Our priors on the to hypotheses are roughly equal (50%). They predict the data with probability 1% (6' given a woman) and 7% (6' given a man). [Hence total probability of 6' is 1%<i>50% + 7%</i>50% = 4%.]<p>Now, our Woman hypothesis predicts the data more poorly than the Man hypothesis, so we need to update our confidence in the hypotheses appropriately.

Originally we had Woman:Man odds as 1:1, so now it must be 1:7 (or 12.5% for Woman).<p>If you think of a column plot with hypotheses along the horizontal axis, where the width of each column is proportional to the prior, and the height is proportional to the strength of the prediction of the data.

To be blunt, students are frequently taught things that are just plain wrong.  Not short-cuts or half-truths.  Not nit-picks like the slope mentioned in the article.  Things that they should never have been taught at all.  Whether it's bad text-books or teachers who majored in psychology being roped into teaching math, even one of the best high-school systems in the world doesn't get it right all the time.<p>I haven't viewed any videos from Khan academy, but I think a public repository of lectures that are rigorously checked for correctness can only be a good thing.  Is that what Khan's academy really is though?  Teachers are trained to engage young minds.  Is it realistic to expect flawlessly correct lessons from someone with this background after just two weeks of immersion in a given topic, especially when reference materials (e.g. highschool textbooks) are so often riddled with mistakes?  If you're teaching math or physics, why not collaborate with a mathematician or physicist?  Let Khan's teachers handle how to structure lessons and provide engagement while experts in their field provide the material.  There are plenty of experts out there who would jump at the chance to help, if only to save themselves from headaches when teaching first-year courses!<p>I also think people often overlook the fact that Khan Academy isn't really meant to be a revolution for the worlds privileged students.  What KA really does is provide access to learning materials to people all over the world who do not have access to good teachers.  People like to point out that recorded lectures do not provide the interactive element that real teachers do, and that's absolutely true.  However, there is no substitute for homework.  To learn math, one must <i>do</i> math.  No amount of interactiveness can change that.

Facebook is a company that's had 8 years to learn how to monetize, despite all the obvious ways of doing it (premium upgrades, etc.) so the wise bet is that if they haven't learned to juice it by now, any more than they already have, then they never will. Is it possible they might? Yes. But that's not the smart way to bet given the facts. Apple and Google and Amazon have tons of talented folks and have shown they can monetize and diversify their products. Facebook really hasn't.

That's a sentence or two that explains the problem you solve and how you solve it.  It looks like you want attention from developers.
