She was ""sexually assaulted"" while she was passed out drunk at a party. She wasn't raped. She probably didn't experience anything during the assault and wasn't injured or infected with an STD. She probably didn't even know it happened until the pictures surfaced. If she's passed out in the pictures, then they shouldn't ruin her life or cause her much distress, because they only prove that she got drunk at a party and that some idiots groped her. If she doesn't appear to be passed out in the pictures, then she probably just regrets slutting it up.<p>I'm quite serious: the ""trauma and agony"" that she ""must"" be going through is probably mostly a product of her overdramatic imagination.

4280192,comment,4278659,4279002,5,0,lloeki,,,"The ""best"" (as far as I'm concerned) UI I've ever encountered is in my current car ([0] sports with satnav,  [1] classic without satnav). It is also, as far as many other people are concerned, one of the most startling ones.<p>- information is divided in three distinct physical and logical areas: 1. primary, topmost 2. secondary, behind the steering wheel and 3. tertiary, centermost. The entire dashboard is designed to reduce information overload and let the driver focus on actual driving.<p>- the primary area sits topmost, right in front of the driver. It holds the most critical pieces of information: frontmost and unmistakable, the speed, in huge, high contrast lettering. On the left, the rev alert: six orange leds, off most of the time, light up as you get close to the limiter. On the right, the display differs according to the version: Type-R gets a logo and a red i-VTEC led when the aggressive valve timing engages, while other models get a symmetric indicator similar to the rev alert, showing the ECU logic regarding fuel injection, which gets presented as 'Eco' leds: the less fuel is in injected regarding the map, the more leds light up. Big bright green turning indicator arrows are present in this area too, one on each side of the speedo.<p>This display stands up and far. it can bee seen by far-sighted people (presbyopia) <i>without glasses</i>. Like a HUD, I can actually read it while looking at the road in front of me. When looking far away ahead, the information is shown in such a way that I can, at the bottom edge of my vision, notice changes in display and evaluate revs/eco. Leds ""progress bars"" light up two at a time, making changes visible even without focusing.<p>- the secondary area gives richer information, but sits closer to the driver. The area is actually three-dimensional: the centermost display sits on a black 'tower' and the needles themselves are noticeably above the digits. The lightning makes the tower invisible, and the needles pop out even more which reinforce the sense of depth. The minimum of information is shown (revs, fuel, engine temperature), and more as required (lights state, other system warnings and alerts). The LCD on the center 'tower' can display select information at will. When an event is triggered (low fuel, oil, door opened...) this display turns orange, with both a pictogram and text explaining the condition. When any alert pops up, there is an audible chime, along with a bright orange (i) notification on the right side of the primary area. This notification stays up until you manually clear it.<p>- tertiary gives accessory information: time, audio, A/C, satnav (if applicable). The dashboard being drawn along an arc, the display faces the driver (really visible in [2]). The recess is made such that the passenger can see this display, but the primary consumer of the information is the driver.<p>- from the steering wheel and the gear stick, every important button is within fingers reach. Every secondary button requires minimal movement. Thanks to the enveloping arc shape , the car fits the driver, like a hand in a glove.<p>From outside, the car is (love it or hate it) unlike any other, and this is enough to warrant curiosity from both relatives and random people. When looking at the cabin, the words ""Star Trek"" have yet to fail to be mentioned. It's an entirely fresh design that strike many as odd and gimmicky, but that I find extremely convenient and well thought, with every detail having a reason to be.<p>Compare and contrast with the proposed design, which like many designs before, crams all levels of information in a single display area (two screens side by side <i>is</i> a single area), facing the area between the two front seats (I'm sure the dog in the boot <i>loves</i> to see where he's going and at which speed). Display in the center is an atrocity. People have a tendency to go where they look, and if they look at the center display, their line of sight is outside the road, and uselessly increases the left blind spot. Making the <i>farside</i> display touch make sit even worse. Not only will it bring in the gorilla arm effect, the body of the driver is required to move far from its proper driver position.<p>[0] <a href=""http://wowallpaper.com/wallpapers/civic-type-r-dashboard-1280x1024.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wowallpaper.com/wallpapers/civic-type-r-dashboard-128...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.km77.com/marcas/honda/2006/civic/gama/gra/35.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.km77.com/marcas/honda/2006/civic/gama/gra/35.jpg</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.eurodb.com.au/New-used-car-review/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/honda-civic-type-R1-300x229.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurodb.com.au/New-used-car-review/wp-content/uplo...</a>",1343035156
