4311612,comment,4311060,4311327,2,0,jules,,,"While Scala's objects may be comparable to OCaml's modules, implicits add something on top of that to bring it much closer to type classes. As the name implies you do not have to specify the instance at each call site. The implicits mechanism can automatically resolve an instance based on the type. If you want a different one you <i>can</i> pass a different instance manually, however.",1343642294
4311611,comment,4299119,4302324,2,0,jasomill,,,"Three things come immediately to mind: non-paginated layouts, immutable output, and tool support.<p>First, while most of the basic TeX algorithms for things like line-breaking and hyphenation could be implemented in terms of browser primitives, the overall TeX system is irrevocably page-oriented. While the maximum page length could theoretically be increased to ""essentially infinite"" through judicious widening of TeX's integer data types, this would break lots of TeX code and documents, for both performance and layout reasons.<p>Second, one of Knuth's main design goals for TeX was ""perfect"" backwards and cross-platform compatibility for documents, to the extent that he implemented everything in terms of integer math to avoid minor output variations due to slightly different floating-point implementations on various systems. If this is a design goal for a ""drop-in"" replacement system, it's not clear that the browser is a good target platform, because you generally <i>want</i> browser vendors to take advantage of things like hardware accelerated rendering that tend to be incompatible with ""pixel-perfect"" output for all permissible resolutions.<p>In both of the above cases, it's clear that lots of preparatory work needs to be done simply to understand what a high-quality platform for technical publishing in ""native Web form"" should even look like  but chances are good that it'll look quite a bit different than TeX, if only because the browser is quite a bit different than the printed page.<p>Finally, I use Emacs to write TeX documents and I rarely use any particularly sophisticated editor support  beyond simple syntax awareness and highlighting  and I'm hardly alone. The fact that TeX is, like Emacs, largely implemented ""in terms of itself"" means that it's often more natural to implement automation in the document (where I include various third party packages in my definition of the ""document"", my point being simply that the document itself drives the automation at ""runtime"") rather than relying on powerful external editing and preprocessing tools. For authors like me who aren't professional Web designers and/or JavaScript programmers, the prospect of using anything related to HTML and DOM as bases for input and macros sounds like a nightmare. People commonly use TeX equation notation in plain text contexts, because, unlike SGML derivatives like HTML and MathML, TeX was designed to be written and (at least to some extent) read by humans. Again, there are lots of reasonable alternatives ranging from powerful editing tools that could potentially at this point be implemented in the same language as the document itself, which would have certain advantages, to extended versions of preprocessed input formats like Markdown. But again, it'd take lots of work to establish ""one and only one"" of these options as a standard.",1343642293

It is is you think that clear communication is also the waste of time.

How about the litteral use then? Should we just censor it out?

I don't think it will ever happen on Mobile.<p>Animations play a very important role in communicating to the user how to interact with the interface.  Animations also give the illusion of a responsive app.<p>The best apps are likely built by great designers who know how to use animations effectively to communicate with the user.<p>Everyone else will simply try to copy the best apps along with their animations... thus, it's hard to see animations going away any time soon.<p>On another note, I find it surprising that yours was the only comment even mentioning design.  For me, that was the most important part of the article with by far the biggest implications.<p>The author predicts that designers will be able to take on a portion of the client-side engineering role in the near future.  If this happens, it will completely change how apps are made.  It will change the workflow between designers and engineers.<p>The traditional model of mocking up a PSD and passing it off to an engineer will no longer be viable.  Designers will just build clients and interact with APIs.  This means that more and more designers will probably have to learn programming, which is a good thing for the future of mobile apps.",1343639124
