4205988,comment,4205553,4205929,18,0,ok_craig,,,"I don't disagree with these points, but my personal take is that the primary difference between software patents and other patents is that most things that end up getting patented in software are things that pretty much any programmer may implement in the course of trying to solve some problem.  The patented algorithms often aren't novel or unique, but someone just stood up first and said ""Look here what I did. I want a right to exclusivity on this."" Even though someone trying to get to the same end goal at some point in the future probably would have easily developed the same method.<p>In drugs, the end result gets patented.  Some chemical formula that's just right, which (in most cases) was not simply stumbled upon in the pursuit of something else.  And even if it was stumbled upon, it's still novel and was not likely to be created as a product or byproduct by another party very easily. The insight required to develop the drug was most likely unique.<p>The equivalent to most software patents today in the drug field would be patenting methods of, say, mixing chemicals.  Imagine if there was a patent on mixing two solutions by pouring one from a beaker into the other in a flask, twirling around twice and then shaking gently four times.  What if someone had a license to that mixing method and everyone else had to pay to do it?  It'd be ridiculous.  It seems like that's basically what software patents are.<p>The equivalent to drug patents in the software world would be, I guess, patenting an entire OS, or an app, or some fully integrated, significant piece of software.  For example, no one should be able to make a counterfeit copy of iOS as a whole and sell it as their own.  <i>That</i> I would support legally.  I (think?) this is already covered by copyright law.",1341539398

When I 1st used my e-ink kindle and noticed the refresh flash I actually thought it was a problem. I asked a friend who had one prior to me if his did the same and initially he said no. Then he went to check and realised that yes, it does. He then yelled at me for pointing it out as it wasn't something he'd even taken notice of in the past but now couldn't avoid focusing on every time he turned a page.<p>For me, I got used to the refresh flash and it doesn't bother me in the slightest or disrupt my reading. I don't really see the need for a page turn metaphor. The fact the next/previous buttons are right where I'm holding the device is a huge plus in my mind. Devices where you need to swipe the screen to turn a page seem to be missing out on the huge advantage.<p>The one thing which I absolutely needed to learn how to hack was the margin size.

I do worry that those not familiar with various ser/deser schemes for Java will draw the wrong conclusions.  My take-away is that you should not blindly use Java serialization in cases where performance matters and you don't need the broad spectrum of use cases it covers.<p>The main reason that Java serialization is so slow is that it is designed to persist self-describing, arbitrary object graphs.<p>Self-describing = Full package+class names and versions.  Any object graph containing Serializable classes available via the classloaders of both the sender and receiver.<p>Arbitrary object graphs = The identity of objects is preserved.  Let's say that 17 SalesOrder objects point to the same Customer object.  salesOrderA.getCustomer() == salesOrderB.getCustomer() (identity in Java for those who haven't had the pleasure) is maintained.<p>Oh, and JDK dynamic proxies are handled as a special case.  And some other stuff, too.  I had the pleasure a few months ago of copying the JDK's serialization code into my own package structure and adding logging so we could debug deser issues in an OSGi environment.  From what I can tell, the impedence mismatch between OSGi classloading hierarchies and Java Serialization makes this combination a non-starter.<p>The very-performant sample case provided in the blog posting works only for a list of flat objects.  As soon as you try to preserve identity, you must implement a two-pass system where you deser placeholders and then resolve them later.  I'm not suggesting that it isn't useful, but it probably constrains your serializable objects to such a degree that you'll be unhappy in other areas of your system.<p>Kyro (as another commenter noted) seems like the best combination of small size/speed/general-ness that I've encountered thus far.  There seem to be a reasonable number of pre-built Kyro serializers for common libraries such as Joda time.<p>For a project I worked on recently where size was more important than speed, I took advantage of the similarity of the objects I was serializing and wrote a custom serializer which created dictionary look-ups on the fly.  Repeated strings were turned into small integers, etc.  I wish I didn't have to write it.<p>In a nutshell, if you constrain the scope of the problem you are attempting to solve, the maximum possible performance of the system across covered use-cases goes up.  Java Serialization's performance is relatively poor compared to less generalized schemes -- as expected.",1341538723

4205929,comment,4205553,4205553,45,0,kenjackson,,,"Posner's right.  It seems that there needs to be some new notion of what constitutes patentability.<p>Drugs are an interesting case as they have these factors going for it:<p>1) Expensive to bring IP to market.  Lots of testing and clinical trials for drugs.  For SW it is pretty cheap now.<p>2) Easy and cheap to copy.  Generic versions can be reverse-engineered quickly.  Probably just as easy to copy software, but I still feel like this is probably a useful pillar.<p>3) The IP by itself constitutes the majority of the value of the product.  In medicine there isn't typically tons of other IP around that come together to form the product.  In SW there is rarely a single piece of IP that is more than a small fraction of the value of the product.<p>4) The IP has longevity as a standalone product.  Viagra can be sold for decades.  Aspirin still probably does hundreds of millions in revenue.  There is little SW IP that, by itself, has longevity.  The nature of SW is to continuously improve it.<p>5) Time to market isn't a huge advantage.  Since most medicine is just sold as effectively a commodity, being 6m ahead of your competition usually just means you have 6 extra months of revenue.  Whereas in SW it also means that gives you 6 months to build on your current IP.  In medicine you don't typically do Viagra 2.0, with a boatload of new IP that makes the original obsolete (and hence any competitors shipping the old version scrambling).",1341537963

4205877,comment,4203443,4205616,17,0,Xcelerate,,,"""Astonishing"" is exactly what I was thinking of as well.  There's a lot of vitriol in this post.  You say that you could go on and on and no one would care.  But that's not true.  If you list good, logical arguments against something, people will listen.  Instead, there's an almost instinctive urge to rebel against your points solely because of your post's tone, which is antagonistic to what I assume is your goal.<p>In my opinion, Clojure doesn't try to one-up Lisp.  Rich Hickey recognizes the great value of Lisp and wants to share these features with a wider audience -- I can't say I would have ever taken an interest in Lisp if it weren't for Clojure in fact.<p>Check out Clojure's rationale page (<a href=""http://clojure.org/rationale"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clojure.org/rationale</a>).  Rich says he wanted a language that is:<p><pre><code>    *A Lisp
    *for Functional Programming
    *symbiotic with an established Platform
    *designed for Concurrency
</code></pre>
And he says he couldn't find one.  That's not a subjective statement -- there wasn't a language with all those features before Clojure.  And I'll bet there's a lot of people that want those four things.  His language does that very well.  That doesn't mean it should be used for everything, but he never implied it that anyway -- quite to the contrary, he explicitly points out the problem domain that Clojure addresses.<p>I think you misunderstand the designers of these new languages.  Most of them aren't trying to make something ""trendy"" (that should be obvious by how many esoteric hobby languages there are).  They are trying to solve problems.  And if some people other than the author of the language can get some use along the way, well then that's just great.<p>Clojure isn't the product of ""immature minds"" either.  It's the product of one mind, and one that's spent many years thinking about good language design and many years working with software in industry.",1341536705
