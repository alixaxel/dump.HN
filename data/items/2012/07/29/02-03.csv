Heard of automated testing?<p>It makes absolutely no difference what language you write your code in, whether it's PHP, Python or Brainfuck - reliability is dictated by your testing strategy, not the language. In the PHP applications I write, the only things that break are the things I didn't test.",1343530781
4307366,comment,4307136,4307136,14,0,neotek,,,"CAPTCHA seems relatively pointless at stopping spammers since there are dozens of online services that use human labour to solve them for a dollar per thousand.<p>In tests on my own sites I've found that introducing reCAPTCHA during the registration process leads to a significant increase in people abandoning their registration when they fail at recognising the text the first time, without putting a significant dent in spammer registration at all. I've found it far more effective to do things like randomising form field names (instead of using names like 'username' and 'password') so the spammer has to scrape the site to figure out which fields he needs to submit for each and every account he registers, silently dumping registrations that don't use the correct field names, and then applying various heuristics to successful registrations to detect patterns common to spammers.<p>For instance, one particular spammer always seemed to use the same user agent string and didn't ever trigger any of the AJAX calls on the page. It was trivial to detect registrations coming from that one spammer and silently dump new accounts when he created them.",1343530757

I'm not sure that contradicts anything that I said.<p>I think Samsung can raise invalidity issues in the case before the judge/jury. If Apples patents are deemed invalid then they will get nothing.<p>The Apple patents that I'm aware of are fairly basic but can be worked around. E.g. by stopping scrolling dead at the end of the range and requiring something other than a swipe to unlock.<p>FRAND is a commitment made in standardisation to prevent the standards group from being an illegal cartel. That commitment should be kept. But a single company making a patented feature desirable would not trigger antitrust concerns in the general case so they wouldn't have needed to make an FRAND commitment. The potential exception would be for the Microsoft FAT patent because FAR is effectively a standard and while not created by a group of companies Microsoft was a monopolist. This is a rare case when I think FRAND may be appropriate rule for MS to adopt even if not legally require.<p>Yes the patent system is currently ridiculous and needs to grant far fewer but that is a complaint against the system which I would like to see reformed but you have to play by the rules in force. As I've said in a few posts I don't remember any tech giants (even Google and Samsung) campaigning against the patent system or even software patents. If the rules as they exist are enforced maybe that will change and the big players will want to change the system.",1343530554
