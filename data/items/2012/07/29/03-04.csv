We all know that the first word is extremely hard to identify, and according to the author ""secretary"" wasn't the control word.<p>This means that reCAPTCHA knows the first word. Identified by OCR? Not possible unless reCAPTCHA deliberately distorted the image. Identified by N other people? Not possible to determine such a word with confidence either.<p>Or am I missing something?",1343534345

4307460,comment,4303709,4304228,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"""I don't see the replacement.""<p>Perhaps you aren't patient. The democratic party steamrolled the republicans in the 2008 race. And you are correct that they didn't change the policies that many people really wanted them to change. The republicans came back with their 'tea party' in 2010. That was two replacement cycles, we're coming up on the third. It may surprise you to know but people who want to be in office, and get kicked out, try to figure out why they lost. That feedback loop is slow (and others have pointed out you probably don't want a government that can change too quickly). But it does work. Compare policies from 2008 to 2010 and 2010 to the present. You will see if you look across a broad spectrum of politicians people trying to adapt so that they can win re-election (or election in general).<p>I think you will see some interesting effects from the current federal harassment of California marijuana clinics. Look at gay marriage and the path it has taken, this is a long conversation and everyone in the country has a point of view. The current state of affairs with pot has already put a huge dent in the whole 'gateway drug' hypothesis so often used to argue against legalization.",1343533728

4307447,comment,4307261,4307261,10,0,patio11,,,"Consumer product companies sort of foreshadowed what happened to food (+), is happening to clothes, and will probably eventually happen to everything physical.  The fundamental product (soap, razor blades, etc) is <i>done</i>.  It works, involves no novel technology, and can be created at infintessimal marginal cost by any player in the industry.  (Try to guess what the price of the soap in a bar of soap is.  If your answer is expressable in whole cents, you are incorrect.)  This suggests that prices would crater except that <i>branding works</i>: there is no discernable difference in any product in the hand soap aisle, so they spend <i>tremendous</i> amounts of money on advertising, over years, because they know that stamping that dove on the bar will dominate your purchasing decision years later.<p>I'm well aware of this, and I'm 30, and I haven't shopped for a bar of soap in America for 10 years.  Ruriko and I were at a Walgreens on our honeymoon and needed to buy one.  I immediately started looking for Dove and, when asked if I needed help, said ""Try to find the white/yellow box with the bird on it -- that is the best one"" before conscious thought intervened and said ""Well, honestly, every box on these shelves is identical, but the difference in prices between $2.69 and $0.89 is so miniscule for the average shopper that they'll mentally respond to marketing like I just did.""<p>+ The e.g. tomato or pasta sauce is solved, cheaper than it has ever been, and (seasonal fluctuations nonwithstanding) will only get cheaper over time.  It is an observable fact that, for any particular basket of food, we pay less than our parents did.  This is discomfiting to people trying to sell us food.  Most discussion of food in America is values signaling.  (e.g. ""Don't eat that, it's not healthy/environmentally sustainable/organic/etc"" is, to a first approximation, likely as relevant as the color of your bar of soap.)<p>Clothes are trending in this direction, too.  Have you heard ""You should buy X, X is quality, X' was probably created in a Chinese sweatshop?""  Horsepuckey, everything is created in Chinese factories now, by the same people, from the same materials, <i>using functionally the same designs</i>.  The only distinction is the name on the label.  (This is why clothing brands are in an epic battle with counterfitters, because if it weren't for criminal penalties for bringing fake Gucci bags into the country fake Guccis would be <i>absolutely indistinguishable from the genuine article</i>.  They're like fake diamonds.  You know what a fake diamond is, these days?  It is <i>a diamond</i> which did not begin life owned by the right people.)",1343533243

So for instance, the TV that OP had that he did not use to watch 'live TV' would not have needed to be licensed. You'd have probably got nasty letters about it, but would be well within your rights not to pay for a license as you would not be using it.<p>Also, although it has no weight on this discussion, it's worth mentioning that TV licenses are per household, not per TV.<p>However, having said that, the BBC probably has to take adequate precautions to stop non-UK viewers watching the Olympic coverage as part of their deal with the organising committee to be the 'official broadcaster'. Sports broadcasting is a massive money maker, I'm sure! :)<p>I don't know whether this would mean a US citizen using a proxy to view the BBC feeds is breaking the law though. Interestingly, our extradition treaty with the US [1] ""allows the US to extradite UK citizens and others for offences committed against US law, even though the alleged offence may have been committed in the UK by a person living and working in the UK"", although there is apparently no reciprocal right.

Now, reCaptcha never gives you real words as a test, so he shouldn't be surprised that it isn't a real word.<p>The third captcha complained about is actually incredibly easy.
