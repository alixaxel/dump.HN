Though that said ARM is also in that area and alot cheaper to obtain ARM compatable kit.  ARM was born out of frustrations/limitation with the original 6502 CPU and in that may be a better more practical use of your educational time.<p>That all said - every programmer of any language should at least learn/play with one assembly language sometime in there life, maybe one or two.  I remember after my ZX81 I opted for the Oric-1 over the Spectrum just becasue it had a different CPU (6502) and after that I opted for the AtariST (6800) and a amstrad PC (X86).<p>Also inventing your own CPU/assembler is not as hard and intimidating as alot will think.

They are just as wrong in their beliefs as those who supported segregation were or those who were against women's suffrage were. Marginalizing these people for their ridiculously antiquated beliefs is fair game, IMO.<p>A thousand times this.  Some opinions need to be taken out back and shot, and being against gay marriage is one of those opinions.  Shitty beliefs like that aren't something that needs protection, and adults who hold those opinions should not be coddled or kowtowed to anymore.<p>In programming terms, showing deference to these kinds of opinions is like being forced to support Windows 3.1.",1341733756

One is the special rights and privileges given to married couples, and the other is the actual word ""marriage"". What I was suggesting is that the government should drop the term ""marriage"" from their vocabulary and change it to something else, like ""domestic partnership"". I highly doubt that anyone employing rational thought would suggest we can do away with the concept of mutually exclusive partnership between two people in the legal realm. Part of what the people on the right are arguing for is to not have the actual term ""marriage"" redefined by the government. That word has a lot of tradition and meaning. If we turn the conversation towards removing that word from the government's laws and replacing it with something that has less specific meaning to people, then the conversation is purely about equal rights and not a fight over a word and the tradition behind it. I think that's more what people are getting at when they suggest that the government shouldn't be involved in marriage.",1341731398
