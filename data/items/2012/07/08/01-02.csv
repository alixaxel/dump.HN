But the ""ain't so safe"" side tends to win out because humans make mistakes.<p>I'm of two minds about this as well but I came to a different conclusion. In the case of Fukushima and Chernobyl I believe it was reduced to incompetence to save cost. I would hope that others have learned the lesson when dealing with nuclear energy because fossil fuels can be deadlier (generally more casualties) and more expensive.",1341712725

In other words, it is an economy of the self-employed.  The US still has 20% of the work force that is self-employed and only 1/4 of those are doctors, lawyers, and others offering professional services.  Anything which enables others to become self-employed moves us in that direction.<p>Any distributist approach cultivates the possibility and mentality of self-employment.  Whatever form that takes is OK with me, even if that is the paradox of self-employment as a member of a larger firm.",1341712710

That introduces a lot of regulation, and still ends up being very expensive for the taxpayers.<p>What I'm proposing essentially separates ""place to securely hold my cash, and provide ATM services"" from ""place to invest money long term"".<p>Now, I agree that long term interest rates would rise, but it doesn't follow that mortgages would become unaffordable. What's more likely IMO is that houses become a lot cheaper. The main ""anchor"" to the price of a house is your ability to pay a fixed percentage of your income. Rather than paying 25% of your monthly income on a 30 year mortage at 5%, you'd probably end up paying 25% of your monthly income on a 10 year mortgage at 8%.",1341712378

A similar theme applies to South Korea - which probably has the most sophisticated bond market in Asia (ex-Japan). Even for Japan as well, the most sophisticated market in Asia, the <i>keiretsu</i> system drives most of the inter-corporate funding and credit.<p>The equity capital markets in both China and India are peanuts as compared to the bank-lending market for corporate funding and that's likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future - a crash in the HSI or the Sensex doesn't spell doom for the economy. The fact that we see China willing to allow RMB-trading in the London markets or to build an equity market-making operation implies a tactical funding alternative - <i>not</i> wholesale market ""liberalization"" as we perceive it.<p>As far as the debt-markets are concerned, these countries have been extremely wary of the implications - especially post the credit-crisis and the disastrous impact on high-yield names in the developed world. Non-performing corporate loans are a big  problem as it is in both these nations and unsafe leverage is avoided at all costs. Foreign-currency bond issuances are strictly controlled by their respective central banks and domestic-currency corporate issuance is virtually non-existent. For a recent example of strict capital controls: to safeguard the Indian economy against commodity inflation and INR weakness on general growth concerns, the RBI imposed strict conditions on importers/exporters specifically and on FII transactions generally.",1341710161

I can improve performance by deleting a lisp function, reimplementing it in a new .cc file, and restarting the interpreter. The interpreter will transparently run make, which will transparently compile the new file.
