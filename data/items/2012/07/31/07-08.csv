Because maybe it's just a common hard problem to solve for ad networks. Or maybe it's Facebook who specifically have a problem.

4316185,comment,4315578,4315578,5,0,makecheck,,,"Having lots of lines of code isn't a badge of honor, nor is it a particularly good measurement to begin with.  I wish that publications would stop stating this number like it means anything.  I could probably think of 10 ways off the top of my head to skew the lines of code that a function would require without even affecting the size of the binary (heck, just change the style of <i>braces</i>...).  I could change one line and create a buggy mess, or remove 1000 lines and create a brilliant masterpiece of efficiency.<p>Something that <i>might</i> mean more is growth in code complexity over time.  For instance, if measured every month for a year without changing the compiler version or platform, how much bigger or smaller did the compiled binaries become?  How much more or less memory and runtime were consumed?  How many ""severe"" bugs were found?  When overlaid with information on the features that were added or removed during that time, it should become a lot clearer how large the code base really is and how maintainable it will be.",1343721368

And if your are implementing a feature over Twitter via their api you are very vulnerable to this. Anytime twitter could implement this feature. Because you most probably have a user base of  ""small subset of Twitter's"", you will have a great problem after all the users have access to this feature. This will make you the second competitor for the feature and move Twitter to leadership for it.<p>So building features over somebody else's API is a bad move.

In 1998, if advertisers paid the maximum that traffic was worth to them, Yahoo's revenues would have \n<i>decreased.</i>""<p>I remember when AdSense ads used to be images and Google replaced them with text links, essentially reducing the clickable surface area of the ads.

Just look at the source code[1]. They save a few low bits for the worker ID, data center, and worker-specific sequence. The highest bits are the timestamp bits.<p>Maybe you can correct me if my assumptions based on the code are wrong, but my guess is you'll magically find that Twitter's highest ID grows linearly with time. Then you're just randomly sampling within this maximum timestamp. At this point you're assuming that Twitter sees a constant rate of signups wrt time, which I highly doubt.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/blob/master/src/main/scala/com/twitter/service/snowflake/IdWorker.scala"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/twitter/snowflake/blob/master/src/main/sc...</a>",1343718775
