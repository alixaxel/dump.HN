The word ""retarded"" as it is commonly used in modern colloquial English originates with its use to describe people with mental disabilities of one form or another: they were at one time classified broadly as ""mentally retarded"". That was gradually abbreviated as ""retarded"", which has gradually been used as an insulting term for all manner of things (including but by no means limited to humans).",1342954515

4277031,comment,4276625,4276899,14,0,exDM69,,,"> Bytecode on the web is a shitty idea.<p>In my book, some kind of byte code or other intermediate language is a lot better idea than distributing the source code of web apps. There are a lot of disadvantages to delivering programs (for immediate execution) as source code. Note: this is orthogonal to open source and licensing.<p>So what would be needed is an intermediate program representation that:<p><pre><code>  - Is well defined
  - Is a good compilation target from various source languages
  - Is easy to validate for correctness and security
  - Is fast to interpret and compile
  - Distributed in fast to read binary format
  - Suits a dynamic language
</code></pre>
In my opinion LLVM IR or CLR bytecode are the most technically suitable alternatives out of existing ones.<p>The web has quite a long legacy of Javascript and a tradition of supporting deprecated browsers so this kind of revolution is unlikely to happen any time soon.<p>> Besides: I can't think of language-neutral bytecode projects that ever worked. Remember Parrot?<p>JVM, CLR and LLVM are all popular compilation targets that are used with dozens of different source languages each. Bytecode and program representation was never the hard part,  it's the frameworks of the OS/platform underneath.",1342954500

4277028,comment,4275140,4275140,5,0,liquidcool,,,"My observations as someone who's checked job boards/sites continually for almost 20 years:<p>Through the mid-nineties, when I graduated college, the requirements were reasonable. A solid understanding of software development fundamentals and reasonable experience for the advertised position. Focus was on ability and potential.<p>A few years later, as the .com boom was underway, requirements dropped to unreasonable levels. I saw people with embarrassing ""qualifications"" who were far better compensated than me. If you could grope a computer without getting slapped, you were hired to build web sites and paid top dollar.<p>A few years later, after the bubble burst, the pendulum swung in the other direction, hard. The market was flooded with applicants, and requirements at best matched the resume of the person who left. At worst, we got ""10 years of Java"" in 2001. Focus was on experience in very specific (and usually broad ranging) skills.<p>I have seen very little recovery from this point. It became the new norm. I do think it's getting better, but not a lot better, and only recently.<p>People are hiring employees like they would consultants or contractors. For short term hires, I want very relevant experience because paying premium, short term rates to someone learning on the job is very expensive. But if I'm hiring an employee, I just want someone who can learn quickly and with whom I can happily work for the next 5 years.",1342954290

Binary search is the right way of thinking about it, but in some sense you haven't really created an even split by dropping the egg from floor 50 - because you know that you can figure out the correct floor faster using two eggs than one, you could check floors 51-100 much faster than you could check floors 1-50 (Even if you just did the naive binary search approach you first applied - i.e. if the first egg didn't break on floor 50 then drop it from floor 75, and then after that use the second egg to check each floor, it would only take you <=25 goes to find the right floor in 51-100, wheras it would take you up to 50 goes to find the right floor in 1-50).<p>So the correct floor at which to make the first drop is clearly not floor 50. If you dropped the first egg from floor 40 you would do better - it'd take you up to 40 goes to find the right floor if it's below floor 40, and up to 31 or so  goes to find the right floor if it's above (because you can reuse the first egg to check whether it's in 40-70 or 70-100). Floor 40 is in some sense a ""more binary"" place to drop the first egg from than floor 50.<p>If you keep following this line of thought, and remember that whenever you make your approach more efficient, you can recursively apply that more efficient approach to ""what do I do if the first egg doesn't break"", you'll arrive at the solution given in the article.",1342951997

No need for a carBerlin has one of the densest subway nets and wide streets make biking fun. In addition, Germany has an amazing social health care system including health, unemployment and pension (when working as an employee).<p>2. A vibrant and fast growing ecosystem of smart people. A vast number of new software talents, founders, software companies and VCs are moving to Berlin, every day (Twitter, Google, Soundcloud, Early Bird and many more).<p>3. People here are open-minded, outgoing, mix well and internationalno need to learn German, everyone speaks English! Making new friends is a matter of days. Visit tons of networking and startup events, every week.<p>4. Easy work permissionsEuropeans do not need any and can work from day one and the rest applies for the hassle-free Blue Card.<p>5. Berlin's night life is unmatched, huge and changing every day (plus ridiculously cheap). Berlin has got some of the most dazzling, naughty, and original clubs on the face of the Earth.<p>Now, the shameless plug: Berlin is calling and getting the new tech hub of Europe.
