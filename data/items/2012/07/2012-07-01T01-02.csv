Claim greed was our downfall? Claim that this was all just too much for the human race?<p>I might be a romantic, but it seems to me that focusing on ways to make all peoples lives better is what we should continue to do. We should be technologically solving that which has plagued humanity the most: limited energy and resources.<p>We shouldn't be spending our time focusing on conservation. We should be focusing on how to make conservation un-necessary. Only then, will poverty go away.<p>Maybe, just maybe, the ideas like mining asteroids, fusion, nano-technology, and AI, just to name a few, are silly. However, they are a lot less silly than creating artificial centrally planed markets like carbon offsets to alleviate poverty.<p>That being said I leave this: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r1CZTLk-Gk"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8r1CZTLk-Gk</a> .",1341107940

I wonder when we'll start seeing 3 level (1.58 bits/cell) or 5 level (2.32 bits/cell) MLC start appearing?  It's more complex to visualize, but the controller already abstracts the details of the storage quite a bit so it's not hard to imagine it spreading your 512 bytes across 2585 instead of 2048 cells.  Some implementations are already doing compression so you could even have the algorithm's output be a tristate stream instead of a binary one if that's marginally more efficient for the silicon.<p>Another thing I wonder is how much neighboring cells interfere with each other.  If that's the case, the most efficient data packing might even rely on bit encodings for multi-cell groups that avoid the combinations that are most likely to cause interference (similar to the 64b/66b encoding in gigabit ethernet, for example)  Again, the controller has to do this type of thing already to implement ECC so it seems like a straightforward extension.<p>Note that I'm not saying that either of these techniques avoid the ""dead end"" you're talking about -- they're both just ways of squeezing a tiny bit more out of the density/reliability curve at the margins.  I'm just imagining how complicated flash controllers might get as they try to capture the last bits of life in the technology.",1341105977

Don't show flashy software, <i>solve problems.</i> Find out what the true problems are with their current software, and solve those. Unfortunately, their problem is NOT that their users don't like using it (well, it's a problem, but not the top problem). The top problem is likely that it isn't fully capturing their process, or it misses certain savings or benefits to the bottom line that it should make obvious. Business problems are the real problems, never forget that.<p>Don't be afraid of investment. Use it to grow when you need to, because your small size will be your biggest downside.

I really don't care for tomatoes here, but I just loved them in Europe.<p>Maybe it's the high quality bread, meat and cheese that they use in Europe, but I'm still shocked that I had the best sandwich of my life at the hauptbahnhof in Munich.",1341104547

4183382,comment,4182627,4182627,3,0,mjb,,,"I have a PhD, and left grad school directly after graduating because I had no real interest in pursuing a career in either research or teaching. I also joined an industry that is only peripherally related to the field I studied, and don't use much of the knowledge I gained on a day-to-day basis. However, I don't regret doing the PhD, and would recommend a similar path to people in the same position as me.<p>Like the author, I learned a great deal during the years of my (European-style, not American-style) program. I learned how to explain complex ideas to experts and laymen alike. I learned how to present data to make a compelling argument, both in text and in graphics. I learned how to read complex technical writing and extract the author's point. I learned how to ask a series of questions that got to the core of a complex matter. There are all soft skills - but I have found that the complement the set of skills that I got from the subsequent years in industry very well.<p>I also had three years to meet and talk to some extremely smart people, which has helped me in several big ways and many small ways in the years since I graduated. Maybe the biggest reason I don't regret doing a PhD was that I got to spend two years gratifying my intellectual curiosity about a topic that I was really interested in. Few people get such an opportunity, and for those who enjoy that kind of thing it's an opportunity not to be missed.",1341104514

In particular, you should understand recursive procedures and simple data structures such as arrays and linked lists.<p>* You should have some facility with proofs by mathematical induction.  A few portions of the book rely on some knowledge of elementary calculus.",1341104509
