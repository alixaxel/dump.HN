4246683,comment,4245737,4246613,1,0,tikhonj,,,"I'm afraid that I'm not too familiar with either active patterns or GADTs at the moment. However, given the understanding that I <i>do</i> have, I think they are both unrelated to the basic dynamic pattern matching that I was talking about.<p>As far as I can tell, active patterns only affect the <i>constructor</i>. They let a constructor like Even to run an arbitrary function when it's matched. This lets you customize what a constructor actually means, which seems very useful, but is orthogonal to dynamic patterns. Dynamic patterns affect the <i>patterns</i> and not the constructors, where a pattern is the expression that is actually matched. That is, given a function f (Foo a b) the pattern is Foo a b. Active patterns would let me customize how Foo works, but the full pattern (Foo a b) still looks and acts the same.<p>Given this meaning of ""pattern"", I think active patterns do not constitute first-class patterns. You can't take a pattern and pass it into a function or make up a pattern of variables that can be any pattern. With first-class patterns, you should be able to take the pattern (Foo a b) and pass it into a function as a pattern. So a function like<p><pre><code>    match pattern (pattern x) = x
</code></pre>
would make sense in a system with first-class patterns. Here, a pattern is an <i>argument</i> to a function and then used to match against the next argument. Hopefully this clarifies the particular thing that dynamic patterns add to the language.<p>GADTs are also unrelated. For one, GADTs only affect the <i>type</i> of a constructor and not its behavior. I did not talk about types in my post at all--everything I talked about would make sense in a dynamically typed language that had pattern matching. It just so happens that dynamically typed languages tend <i>not</i> to have pattern matching like this, so it's associated with statically typed languages.<p>Also, GADTs, like active patterns, only affect the constructor. They do not change the actual patterns used to match against values (except by restricting possible types of the matched values).<p>So really both active patterns and GADTs are somewhat orthogonal to dynamic patterns. When I said a code that is generic over the head of the pattern, I meant a function like:<p><pre><code>    doFoo (a b) = b
</code></pre>
where doFoo will match both Foo x and Bar x and Baz x and extract x in every case. This function is generic over the constructor in the sense that it matches <i>regardless</i> of what the constructor actually is--the constructor becomes just another matchable term.<p>This sort of function, which just uses static patterns, is already something that a GADT cannot do. Dynamic patterns are even more flexible. My match function above lets you take an arbitrary pattern like (Foo a b) and match (Foo a b x) against some value to get x. You're passing a pattern into a function which then uses that pattern to match against its next argument. This feature has nothing to do with the type of the constructor.<p>I hope this cleared things up for you. However, it's almost 4 in the morning and I'm not entirely coherent. If you're still confused, or if I made some glaring errors, feel free to email me about this when I'm more awake :P.",1342349833

4246676,comment,4245737,4246018,4,0,pmjordan,,,"So, there have been a few replies to this post, but as far as I can tell, you're asking about maintaining invariants (""not breaking the structure""), which nobody has addressed so far. Let's have a look how this is handled in different types of languages (^ means I have extensive experience with these, so I might have some of those without a ^ wrong - some languages are also tough to categorise, but bear with me):<p>1. statically-typed OOP: e.g. C#^, Java^, C++^, F#, OCaml, Scala, etc.; specifying the type of a field is a kind of invariant assertion (e.g. name must be a string not a number), and depending on the expressiveness of the type system, these static assertions can become arbitrarily specific. You might still need to do runtime checks in the mutating methods if certain invariants (e.g. length > 0) can't be expressed statically in the language. If internal state can be set to mutable objects (e.g. mutable strings) from outside, you can still break the invariants by mutating the objects after they've been checked. Some type systems (such as Java's generic types) are even notoriously weak, requiring extra care.<p>2. dynamically-typed OOP: e.g. JavaScript^, Objective-C^(see note), Ruby, Python, Io, etc.; generally, no invariants are maintained by default, and everything happens at runtime. So unless you specifically check invariants in the object's methods, invariants can often easily be broken by passing in data with unexpected structure. It is often trivial to pass in objects that satisfy the invariants, then change them in arbitrary ways to violate them afterwards. Encapsulation is frequently also easy to break by extending classes or prototypes.<p>3. statically-typed functional or procedural: C^, Haskell, ML, ATS, etc.; just as with the statically-typed OOPLs, you can explicitly encode many invariants in the type system. You can't set a number-typed field in a record to a string value. To maintain ""softer"" invariants, you will typically have runtime checks in the mutating functions. The languages with a pure functional bent typically encourage concentrating mutable state into a select few places in the code. Those places can be gatekeepers for enforcing invariants.<p>4. dynamically-typed functional or procedural: Lisps such as Clojure^, Scheme and CL^, Erlang, etc.; Where mutable state is allowed, or the default it's just as much a free-for-all as the dynamic OOPLs. You need to make your mutating functions aware of all your invariants, or they're trivially easy to break. In the pure-functional or immutable-by-default languages, again, since mutation is concentrated to a few hotspots (transactions in Clojure, messages in Erlang), those hotspots can easily be made to refuse performing mutations that break invariants.<p>Comparing 1 with 2, and 3 with 4 respectively, it's pretty obvious that the static languages make it easier to maintain invariants. The more expressive the type system, the more you can nail down the permitted structure. The culmination of this are theorem-proving languages. Interestingly, those tend to be functional.<p>So, if you compare 1 and 3, encapsulation buys you <i>some</i> safety in some cases, but realistically, it's just as easy to make a system that permits violation of invariants as it is in functional languages. Some of the more pure functional languages replace encapsulation with constrained mutability to help maintain invariants.<p>Comparing 2 and 4, I'd argue the functional languages actually do a <i>better</i> job helping you maintain invariants. The malleability of objects in (2) languages makes them hard nail down. Immutability on the other hand at least provides stability in <i>time</i>, if not in <i>structure</i>.<p>Note that I'm only evaluating the ability to maintain invariants here, not trying to come up with an overall judgement on languages. In some situations, maintaining invariants is very, very useful. In others, you don't really care that much.<p>(note on Objective-C): while you declare fields and variables with a specific static type, any object-typed field can point to an object of <i>any</i> run-time type. So the static types are mostly just <i>annotations</i> and affect ARC semantics, they're not actually enforced or safe, it basically relies on duck typing; Key-Value Observing in particular makes some pretty deep changes to the run-time types of objects, which wouldn't be possible in e.g. Java. Unlike some of the other dynamic languages, the non-object C types and mostly-fixed memory layout of objects give <i>some</i> level of structural safety. Still, there's nothing stopping you from creating a number class that returns YES for isKindOfClass:[NSString class], thus making it straightforward to fool most invariant checks.",1342349312
4246675,comment,4246022,4246299,1,0,buddydvd,,,"Businesses may share common interests with their vendors or customers but they also almost always share conflicting interests. Unless both parties' interests completely align with each other's, I can't see how a vendor/customer can be considered to have the business's best interests in mind.<p>The article says Dragon agreed to pay Goldman a flat fee of $5 million. What if Goldman did perform due diligence, reported the issues to Dragon, and caused the deal to get cancelled, would Goldman still get $5 million? I don't think so, but if their agreement says they should and I were in Goldman's shoes, I would find reasons to recommend against the deal, because, to earn $5 million, it seems much easier to just advise against the deal than to assist the transaction and bear the risk of a bad outcome. On the other hand, if Goldman gets nothing (or a fraction of the $5 million fee) in the event that the deal gets cancelled, it would be in Goldman's best interests to see the deal go through and avoid performing any potentially deal-breaking services (e.g. due diligence) not specified in the written agreement.<p>There are scenarios where vendors or customers do have the business's best interests in mind. One such scenario is when the vendor or customer has very close family relationship with the business owner (e.g. husband-wife, father-son, etc.) These scenarios are uncommon. To be on the safe side, I agree with the sentiment that only you have your own best interests in mind.",1342349198

Okay, so it's not the <i>simplest</i> thing around, and it hinges upon a bunch of other things also defined in the source. Nonetheless it's not very ""oatmeal and fingernail clippings"" after all. It's pretty straightforward. ""Here is my docstring, let `nargs` be the number of arguments, if this is 2, then we've either got the primitive case (setf a 1) which is actually a `setq`, or else we macro-expand the place which should be a list like `(car a)`, pull off that first symbol `(car place)`, get its function -- call that function `inverse`, then return an expression which will call `inverse` on the `(cdr place)` with the `value-form` we're trying to set to. If this inverse doesn't exist then there seems to be some transformation of the list (a comment would have been nice here, because I'm not sure what this describes). If the number of args is odd then that's an error; if it's an even number greater than two then we assume that the syntax was (setf a 1 b 2) and recurse on the child pairs.""<p>As readability goes, it's not bad.",1342348939

4246636,comment,4245737,4246400,3,0,radiac,,,"To a certain extent it may depend on context (eg code for a conveyancing firm would have a different focus to that of a landlord or mortgage company), but a lot of those instances would already be properties of other instances. In particular, since the contract is the object which ties them all together, I would imagine the best syntax would be closer to:<p><pre><code>  contract = new Contract(property, seller, buyer, agent)
  contract.sign()
</code></pre>
You would then have contract.sign() call property.change_owner(), agent.register_sale() etc. Different classes of properties, buyers, sellers and agents can then implement those methods however they want.<p>The Contract never needs to know anything about those other classes, so you create the different types of property etc by subclassing the appropriate base class, and customising the functions that the contract calls.<p>Sure, OO may not be the right choice for every occasion, but it is just another way of doing things - it does not suck, it makes some things easier and some things harder. Granted, in certain languages it makes some things a lot harder - but just avoid those languages. I think a good programmer would be able to see the benefits of OO and decide whether it was the most appropriate choice for their current project, rather than dismissing the entire concept outright based on a poor understanding or bad experience in some languages.",1342346748
