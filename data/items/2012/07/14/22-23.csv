4245585,comment,4244787,4245353,6,0,ScottBurson,,,"So people should <i>never</i> be allowed to advocate societal changes in which they have a personal interest?<p>I think this is unnecessarily rigid.  All we really need is full disclosure of the nature of the personal interest, which appears in this case to have been provided.<p>I don't know how the author is supposed to complete this research, or even continue it, without funding.  To bar him from advocating for such funding risks the loss of important advocacy from those who are in the best position to know what is going on.<p>I guess you have half a point in that there is some risk of research scientists just collecting a salary and never producing much of value, even though they claim loudly that their research is important; such things have happened.  But I think it's a chance we have to take.  Anyway, the best protection against it is not to tell people like the OP to shut up, but to look closely at their work and decide on our own how valuable we think it is.",1342306368

Sometimes criticism of the FDA takes the form that it is too slow to approve drugs or medical devices that are already approved in other countries. Simultaneously there is criticism that the FDA approves some drugs or medical devices without full information from the companies that make them.<p>I have lived in another developed country with a national health insurance system (for which I was eligible as a foreign resident with a visa that included work permission) and highly educated physicians and some central government regulation of drugs and medical devices. Sure enough, there were drugs there available by prescription that are not available in the United States, and the other way around. Each country's political system balances risk and benefits in its regulatory framework, subject to political pressures of various kinds and trumped in the end by the clinical facts of who lives or dies while taking various drugs or using various medical devices. My son the hacker spent last summer working for one of the large medical device companies in my town, and EVERYTHING about his work was stringently reviewed by the FDA, so much so that the work he completed will probably not see the market for a few more years yet.<p>Alex, I see you are part of that minority of HN users who joined much earlier than I did (which is what I recalled before I checked your user profile). I appreciate many of your posts. I don't know if anyone else here has told you this, but just as you see that I post in a lot of threads about medical research or medical practice regulation (because my mother was a nurse in a research hospital, and indeed was one of the first persons in the entire world to learn how to assemble and disassemble a heart-lung machine), I see that you post a lot on those issues. You appear to come to HN with a worldview that regulation of prescribed drugs has mostly failed, and medical practice in general is ineffective. And yet you also seem to have a view about controlled subtances that is not fully consistent with that point of view, because street drugs that have had no rigorous studies of safety and effectiveness (and are known to put people into hospital emergency rooms from time to time with deadly symptoms) are sometimes championed by you in other posts, while prescription drugs that have been carefully studied in that regarded are doubted in most of your posts.<p>I would suggest to anyone reading this that it would be more consistent to subject ALL of your beliefs to the test of evidence and to find out if ANY drug, prescribed or illicit, really provides benefit to the user, and if ANY seller of drugs, ""Big Pharma"" or your favorite local dealer, has any other motive in mind besides making money. The commonplace HN meme of ""drugs approved by the FDA are bad,"" while ""drugs prohibited by the DEA are good"" is unlikely to be true in general on its face, and anyway has to be tested with good evidence on a case-by-case basis.",1342305988

4245541,comment,4243713,4245366,2,0,nessus42,,,"IANAL, so I'm not arguing from legal principles, but from moral ones. If you want to sell something, you should sell something that is yours, not someone else's. Apple's design belongs to Apple, not to Samsung, and consequently, Samsung should not be allowed to sell it.<p>People who disagree with this, I guess, must somehow feel that design is a much easier task than writing software, and therefore design should be free. (Either that or you think that all software should be free too, but then we'll have to agree to disagree.) The reality of the matter is that good design is very difficult and very expensive. Why should Apple go to all the expense of developing a great design, just to have it stolen?<p>Re legal principles, there are such a thing as design patents, in addition to look-and-feel copyrights, though I have no opinion on their legal merits in general. As to how Apple will progress with this legal battle, I'm sure they will use any and all legal tactics that they believe will be effective. If one asserts that they might set some bad precedent in doing so, for all I know that may very well be the case. If it turns out this way, then Samsung is equally to blame for stealing Apple's design work.<p>Regarding the Nexus, I can't say.

In fact, any company would defend its design as Apple is doing, even if it were moral to make such slavish copies as Samsung is doing, so railing against Apple here is just railing against what any company would do.",1342304724

Get Junio Hamano from Google and several of the top git-core contributors, so they can start releasing open source patches to git that support github's long term roadmap.<p>1. Come up with efficient custom diff functions for a variety of common file types, not just image diffs but also dbdiffs, mp4diffs, and the like. Github has already done some work in this area, and a little known fact is that git already has some support for custom diffs in .gitconfig:<p><pre><code>  https://github.com/blog/817-behold-image-view-modes\n  http://man.github.com/git/git-difftool.html\n  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9154110/data-versioning-with-git-custom-diff-for-specific-files\n</code></pre>\n2. Next, integrate git-annex for storing huge files in git into git core, maybe with a configurable option for where to place the files (perhaps on a github-customized API to S3).<p><pre><code>  http://git-annex.branchable.com\n</code></pre>\n3. Now, with some thought and work, you could start supporting diff-based workflows in a wide variety of disciplines, including movie, image, and document editing.<p>4. You might also start expanding the range of github to start including db versioning capabilities. I am convinced that the successor to Postgres will include schema versioning as a first class capability. One way to do this is to allow every table to have a list of historical schemas s_i each associated with the instances v_j that were populated when that schema was in effect. Then all you need are functions that map from s_i to s_{i+1} to migrate historical data forward in time.",1342303991
