4981552,comment,4980852,4981091,4,0,patio11,,,"Ooh, a rare disagreement: your ""put option"" scenario makes sense if there is an enforceable contract which obligates them to actually hire him in April.  Would you be blocking off April for a consulting engagement in these circumstances?<p>This sounds a lot less like ""contract signed and PO for pre-payment cut"" and more like ""strong interest in resuming discussions with you several months from now.""  That isn't a no-op in terms of negotiations, but you're well aware (and I learned the hard way, multiple times) that there is a very-much-nonzero probability that the discussion in April begins with ""Well, startups move fast.  Conditions have changed and we can't bring you on.  [Optional: But we're really really interested in talking to you in July. (+)]""<p>+ Newbie consultant mistake which I'll confess to: this basically happened exactly when a potential client slow-rolled actually getting a contract signed for three months -- I need CEO approval for this, your point-of-contact turns out to be swamped in the engagement month so let's defer for a month and so we'll defer signing for a month, hang on the contract will be signed any week now but the CEO is busy, hang on we just hired someone and need to get him to speed on this before bringing you on, etc etc -- and only then expressed negative interest in an engagement, after the date had slipped multiple times.  This, naturally, has downsides for the business, both because it consumed a lot of my time in stressful will-they-won't-they admin and because I blew several weeks of availability on the ""Sorry, can't work with you in $YOUR_DESIRED_TIMEFRAME, it's already committed"" basis.<p>Older-and-wiser me would have a) been more aggressive about  getting them to commit to a contract (rather than a weekly or semi-weekly ping which practically oozed with ""I don't <i>really</i> need you to take immediate action on this.""), b) released the optimistic lock on the schedule the first time the client had any issue, and c) if that particular client were to contact me again, they'd get a two line email with a contract and wiring instructions for their 100% deposit attached, to assist them in efficiently administering their vendor relations.",1356771419

The cake example was exactly what I was thinking of when I said that things may be changing (though I couldn't recall the specific example).

4981539,comment,4980131,4981077,2,0,primitur,,,"In my case the personal answer is that there is simply nothing productive, at all, about using Facebook.  It is indeed a total waste of time - for everyone.  I've yet to see anyone actually get any work done while facebook.com is up on the screen.  Perhaps some small businesses use it to communicate with their customers - I don't know, because I personally cannot ever associate Facebook with ""service I want to use"".  Facebook is a service I _have_ to use, only because my friends and associates don't know how to use email properly.  Sad but true fact: everything I get from Facebook, I also get from my Email system - its just that, well, some people just cannot learn to use Email effectively, but certainly logging onto Facebook and dynamically updating the web page in front of them, for some reason, is 'easier'.<p>Personally I think Facebook - and similar services - are a manifestation of Mob Think, and little else.  Its an 'associative' function, building associations.  Unfortunately, association is not the only form of reason - differentiation, identification too - and where these ""beams get crossed"" is where Facebook tries to sit.<p>If Facebook died, all I would have to do is send an email to the important folks in my life informing them ""Please use email.  This is the cc:, this is what its for.  This is the bcc:, this is what its for.  Here is how to add an X-header in case there is something special we need.  Also, GPG.""  Probably it would cost me a week of question-answering, but I'd sure love to be rid of Facebook forever, personally.<p>People are noisy, especially when they 'think' that folks are listening.  Facebook is a proxy for friends who don't normally pay as much attention as we'd all like, and the sad fact of the matter is that most of us don't ever get as much attention as we need from our social sphere ..",1356770768

4981531,comment,4980982,4981472,5,0,noelwelsh,,,"I think it's true that Haskell is better for playing around with the stuff published in ICFP and related conferences. The reason, however, is a bit more subtle. Haskell is the dominant language for programming language research. So publications tend to use it, and Haskell is better adapted at being Haskell than Scala :) There is also more stuff being published in Haskell for this reason.<p>However it is not correct to say that Haskell is more expressive than Scala. It is in some ways but Scala is more expressive in others. There is a paper that discusses type classes in Scala and show they have some advantages over Haskell's implementation. As more people use Scala and discover neat things you do in it, this is feeding back into other languages.

    False -> z

I'm thinking of something like an intelligently-condensed version of the kind of change-replay you see by rolling forward or back through an editor's undo buffer. A system like git would still work the same way, but with this new extra blob of detailed metadata associated with the specific commit.<p>Fractal Designs Painter (now Corel Painter), back in the day, used to have a feature where the entire creation and edit history of a ""painting"" could be captured and replayed in full detail, right down to the level of the brush angle and pressure used by the artist with every stroke. This was useful for creating art at low resolution, then re-creating the piece automatically (and much more slowly) at high resolution. Corel's version may still have this feature; I haven't used it in years. But if it was practical ten years ago in manipulating multi-hundred-megabyte files, certainly it would be possible now, for what are usually plain text files.<p>Instead of just doing a diff or git bisect, imagine being able to load up the commit of a file with one of those ambiguous changes, grab a slider (or your favorite keyboard equivalents), and scrub back and forth through a condensed replay of <i>someone else's</i> actual changes exactly as they were keyed.<p>I'm not sure this would always be a good thing (a form of surveillance?), but it would certainly be useful when the original author of the code is unavailable.",1356769203

In most cases, it's because they found themselves fiddling with the EPROM window and/or carelessly storing the cartridge until bit rot ran its course.<p>There was plenty of benefit to EPROMs back in the day to a developer, but long-term data retention was certainly not one of them.",1356768587

And assuming you have the time and the ressources, you will still be comparable to the many gym lovers in a few years. Your life will be probably better but you won't be a superhuman.
Then there's martial arts? I've done kung-fu and karate but I never felt like I was getting superpowers either.  Many people do martial arts and they walk in the streets every day with us and we don't notice their black belts. Actually, I think that most of the martial you'll do won't compare to what a MMA fighter can do. So no superpower there either. Anyway, if you want to go that route, I recommend the Jack Dempsey book.

I'll gladly recommend this over any book of philosophy.  (Different philosophers click with different people.)  Granted, I was thirteen and a tennis player when I first read it, but I haven't played tennis seriously in over twenty years, and I still use the lessons in this book any time I practice anything physical.  Dancing, chopping onions, running, lifting weights, you name it.  I use it anytime I need to do something where the real intelligence at work is not part of my conscious mind, including controlling my emotions, but it works best with physical skills.<p>Gallwey wrote some other ""Inner Game"" books, but he was a Division I college tennis player, and this was his first book.  This is the book he wrote about the sport he knew, without knowing it would be a best-seller.  I don't know if the others were written to the same level of quality.",1356768328

I hope they get over this ""growth"" phase or that their competitors get more traction (though they'll have to use the same ""growth accelerating"" tactics with their side effects). People need negative experiences too! <i>Negative experiences make ""good"" people and keep people ""good""! (if not overdosing them)</i> ""Goodness"" is relative, but any sub-group can choose its definition of good/bad by liking/disliking certain things.<p>You can't have constructive or productive interaction without negative feedback, and even Fb knows this: as I last heard Fb engineers of some groups have a star rating and dislike buttons on their profiles to receive and give feedback about their work.

According to that statistic, Europe contains some of the fastest growing (Turkey, Estonia, Lithuania) and slowest growing (Greece, Italy, Spain) countries in the world.<p>Your statistic shows poverty rate. The fact that there is greater variation between states in the US than between countries in Europe just shows what many of us have known for years: even if your economy sucks, the worst-off do better in Europe than in the US.

4981482,comment,4976559,4979472,3,0,saurik,,,"As I've stated elsewhere in this thread, this is documented behavior from S3. I also have billions of objects in S3, and I definitely get back 500 errors. I'm sorry, but even the CTO of Twitpic is not in a position to say ""we push infinitely more data than you, so we know better"", at least not for S3 ;P.<p>Honestly, I have to ask: would you know if some tiny percentage of your requests failed with a 500 error? I bet the answer is ""no"", as the idea that you wrote some JavaScript to look for a condition you probably didn't realize could happen is almost 0. I'd love to be surprised, however ;P.<p>(That said, as you are hosting ""images"", at least you could detect it with JavaScript and fix it, so one could thereby imagine a realistic reason why this would not be a serious problem for you; however, I'd argue that you are then treating S3 as an API, not as a static web hosting system.)<p>I have one bucket that has 3,148,859,832 objects in it <- I got that number from the AWS Account Activity for S3, StandardStorage / StorageObjectCount metric. I apparently make 1-2 million GET requests off of it per hour. Yesterday, Amazon returned a 500 error to me 35 times, or 1-2 per hour.<p>That's about a 1 in a million chance of failure, but if you are serving 4 billion images out of S3 (assuming you mean # requests and not # objects), then that means that 4,000 of your requests failed with a 500 error. That's 4,000 people out there who didn't get to see their image today.<p>So, seriously: are you certain that didn't happen? That out of the billions of people you are serving images to off of Twitpic, that you don't have some small percentage of unhappy people getting 500 errors? Again: it is a small chance of failure, but when it happens the browser won't retry.<p>As I said: ""it only happens to some small percentage of requests, but for a popular website that can be a lot of people (and even for an unpopular one, every user counts)"" <- websites like ours serve tens to hundreds of millions of users billions of requests... one-in-a-million actually happens.<p>(edit: Also, I will note that you seem to be using CloudFront to serve the images from S3, which might be a very different ballgame than serving directly out of S3; for all we know, CloudFront's special knowledge of S3 might cause it to automatically retry 500 errors; for that matter, the ""website"" feature of S3 could be doing this as well, but I have yet to get word from Amazon on whether that's the case... just pulling directly from the bucket using the normal REST API endpoint does, however, return 500 errors in the way they document.)",1356768026
