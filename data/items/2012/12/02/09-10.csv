4860714,comment,4859973,4859973,7,0,pandaman,,,"The ""C++ too complex"" story would be very funny if it was not so sad. It originates from the fake ""interview"" Bjarne allegedly gave to the ""Computer"" magazine, here is an example of it (<a href=""http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/I_did_it_for_you_all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/c++/I_did_it_for_you_all</a> or just google for ""sroustrup x-window interview"" there are many similar texts) where Bjarne allegedly says that the goal of C++ was to be so complex that nobody could learn it. It was a cute joke but, naturally, people who had problem getting the joke also had problem learning anything more complex than Java (or Basic, which was more actual at the time). They honestly believed that they cannot code not because of their learning disability but the conspiracy to make the unlearnable language. Over time, the original context has been lost and the joke became the ""common knowledge"", everyone knew C++ is just too damn complex so it's futile even to try to learn, even its creator does not know it etc etc.<p>The actual C++, while, indeed more complex than Java, is nowhere close to the rumored complexity. Say, compared to Common Lisp with 40+ special forms and things like ""loop"" and CLOS, it's just too easy (not that I mean CL is ""unlearnable"" it's just more complex than C++). Somebody with a STEM degree could learn C++ better than many self-proclaimed ""C++ masters"" if just read a book and then looked over the standard. But very few people do that, the myth is just too strong.<p>It's sad because nowadays it gets to the ridiculous point when people will imagine something about the language rules (something very far from the reality) and will refuse to write few lines of code to see the stuff just does not work how they imagined.<p>The only thing worse than ignorance is false knowledge.",1354441592
4860713,comment,4859339,4859339,2,0,coffeemug,,,"<i>They didnt sweat. They didnt cry. They squirmed in their own skin, playing a role of their own inventing. A leader in times of crisis cant have an iota of fakeness in him.</i><p>I love this quote, and it doesn't just apply to leaders or CEOs, it applies to <i>people</i>. Most people I know squirm in their own skin in their personal lives, playing a role of their own inventing. Very, very few people are comfortable enough with themselves to let the people around them peek inside. Interestingly, letting people see you squirm tends to have extremely therapeutic effect, so all that energy you wasted on putting up a facade was completely unnecessary.<p>That being said, I think there is a very fine line here, and excessive honesty can be disastrous. If you try to snatch the curtain away in one fell swoop while you're still uncomfortable in your own skin, what you think will seem authentic, will almost certainly be perceived as an outright panic (because that's what it is). You can't do it too early -- it's a gradual, often painful process of learning, self-acceptance, and building authentic relationships with other people. You're too scared to let the people see your inner self because you're weak, so you lift the curtain a little bit. Doing that gives you insights about yourself and about others, which in turn builds strength. Then you can lift the curtain a little more. Rinse, and repeat, hopefully for the rest of your life.<p>That being said, some people have a natural inclination to go through this process much, much quicker than others. It has certainly been a difficult process for me, and I'm still nowhere near the finish line (in fact, I think this process is asymptotic, and I am just now beginning see the asymptote somewhere in the distance).",1354441583

Then you'll notice that some sites are too slow and do not provide data quickly enough. Of course you can fix that by running 100-10000 parallel HTTP sessions, which seems to create DoS situation for most of smaller sites.

It is also possible to rig a tablet with an ethernet connection directly to a host Mac/Linux/Windows device to eliminate any performance issues that a wifi connection might present, although for this to work effectively the device needs a USB 3.0 connection (some newer tablets are sporting this), both for speed and full duplex communication.

Ie, it's a glorified rate hike masked as a technical non-sequitur.<p>TL;DR: QoS may be useful for networking, but it is not useful for inter-networking.<p>The only use for QoS IMHO is an ""emergency lane"" for health-and-safety traffic, assuming it carried the same disincentives to abuse (jail) as does 911 and other emergency services. (Not even VoIP is ""high-priority"" enough to warrant it.)<p>The other problem with the ""sender pays"" model is that there's no basis for it. You're not ""tying up the line"" by sending any more than you are by receiving. You are either online or you aren't. Anything else is rolling backwards downhill, away from the Internet.<p>I live in Canada, and all of the ISPs wires were subsidized with taxes then handed over to the incumbent carriers to use and sub-let.<p>A network can saturate, that's fine. I have a link that's either on or off, that's fine too. If the overall network speed is disatisfactory, that means it's time to upgrade the switches -- possibly at my expense (I presume that's what I've been paying for) -- but the Internet has always been best-effort and that's also the point. It automatically load balances. QoS is a solution in search of a problem. The solution has always been at the switch when it's saturated. A CPU process scheduler may boost a process temporarily to increase responsiveness, but only for an instant. The  long-term, steady state, is still a free-for all. Nothing stops you from having QoS on your network or PC, but it is not a core service.<p>ISPs simply need to stop over-selling rates and attempting to ""manage"" link speed to compensate. Stop saying there's a difference between plan A and plan B if they come over the same wire. There's no basis for telling subscriber A that they get 512Kbps when subscriber B get 3Mbps over the same wire and there's no technical difference... They both have that wire and that wire is paid for, or being paid for, by their subscription. Both subscriber A and subscriber B pay the same rate and compete for the same throughput. The switch balances throughput fairly and it costs the ISP no more than ever. I'm not against creative pricing and free markets, just against single-use networks being called ""the Internet."" QoS may be a networking technology but it is not an Internet technology.<p>The whole ISP pricing model is artificial, and moving towards the grossly-overpriced text message pricing. The only reason small ISPs can't offer anything like I have described (anymore) is because they have no choice but to buy service through incumbents who are inflicting these QoS and bandwidth management fictions.<p>I have run a network for thousands of users (academic; students with torrents competing with instructors with videoconferencing, and administrators with VoIP), and while it may be appropriate to classify traffic (ex, emergency, or non-emergency), when the customer is ""the public"" and the context is ""a democracy"" all traffic must be treated equally in the extreme, otherwise it is simply discrimination. Even if you classify traffic as ""government"" and ""non-government"", or ""porn"" and ""non-porn"" you have big social fall-out.<p>""The Internet"" is best-effort by design and that is more than enough. In my experience well-intentioned administrators without real-world experience come in and try to ""solve"" the latency problem creating more problems. Latency needs to be fixed at the switch in the same way CPU scheduling is: if a link hasn't spoken recently, it gets a little short-lived priority boost. The user has no say.<p>These management decisions are coming from the same people who buy ""smart"" switches that cost 10 times as much so they can use VLANs as a security technique, when it isn't, and when PPPoE would have worked just as well and provided the desired encryption.<p>We consistently invent little nested versions of our universe (even going so far as to tunnel it all over HTTP, because that's the only port that anyone leaves open now), and we wonder why it's slow and expensive and flaky, and we're no further ahead than we were when we started.<p>/rant",1354439486
