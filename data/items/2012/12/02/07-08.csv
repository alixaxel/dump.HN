For example, a lot of digital distribution gaming companies  (like Steam) have cheaper prices of games in Russia compared to US. So there are all kinds of websites that will sell a Russian key and Russian proxy service so that one can get game for cheap.

4860481,comment,4859973,4860242,3,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Yes, some of C++ is indeed arcane. But what sets C++ apart from other mainstream languages like Java is that you can optimize for reading to a much greater extent than with other mainstream languages like Java or JavaScript. You can create entire DSLs all within the language. I'm not saying this is always a good idea, but if you want to radically pioritize readability, C++ is a better language than most.<p>Some of the boost libraries actually demonstrate this very well. If you look at the implementation of the library, you may be intimidated by its complexity (as you have shown with bind), but if you look at examples of its usage, you will often find it a lot cleaner than other languages.<p>Imagine what you would have to do in Java in order to do what bind does:<p><pre><code>  int diff(int a, int b) { return a - b; }\n  auto reverse_diff = bind(diff, _2, _1);\n  \n  assert(diff(5, 2) == 3);\n  assert(reverse_diff(5, 2) == -3);\n</code></pre>\n(Obviously, this particular example is trivial in any dynamic language, but that's a different debate)<p>I'm not saying C++ is the only or even the best language for creating statically typed DSLs.

This helps me out a lot because instead of skimming the documentation as I go I actually spend a few minutes reading it all and absorbing it. When I'm ready to switch back to my work I'm less scatterbrained about what I'm trying to accomplish. I'm way less prone to skimming the documentation just for the relevant parts.
