There is just not a huge amount of practical benefit to me.  If one has interest in things taking 1-3 seconds for a full rebuild provided one has compiled the code before, there's ccache:<p>I had to install ccache (reason: this doesn't even cramp my workflow enough to bother until doing this benchmarking) and just do this:<p><pre><code>    env PATH=/usr/lib/ccache:$PATH time make -sj10\n    All of PostgreSQL successfully made. Ready to install.\n    6.05user 1.88system 0:02.48elapsed 319%CPU\n</code></pre>\nIf I don't cheat by using ccache, then turning off the optimizer gives me about 50% of my time back:<p><pre><code>    120.00user 11.72system 0:21.75elapsed 605%CPU\n</code></pre>\nHere's the result of touching one c file in the executor and doing an incremental build (including linking):<p><pre><code>    0.74user 0.18system 0:00.68elapsed 137%CPU\n</code></pre>\nA randomly chosen header file gives me about two seconds, with --enable-depend on:<p><pre><code>    3.33user 0.51system 0:01.53elapsed 249%CPU\n</code></pre>\nI like Go, and appreciate that it compiles very quickly in some absolute sense, and for many other reasons, and do not  wish for a hideous preprocessor system, but to me claims against the time it takes to compile a reasonably large C program are dubious enough that is can only lead to overzealous suspicion by parties that have to make a quick evaluation on what to spend their time with.<p>> they take 10-60 seconds for a 1 line change in a .cc file....<p>.cc is another kettle.  Just as the disadvantages of .cc should not be lumped with .c, the opposite also has to be taken into careful consideration: some advantages of .cc are not available to .c, and some advantages of both are retained in .go.<p>Also, ./configure and Postgres's 'initdb'.

Because sound moved at a slow rate through a medium like mercury, an acoustic wave (that is, a sound) could be applied to one side of a volume of mercury and be expected to arrive at the other end after a predictable, useful delay. So what would be done is that a column of mercury with transducers on both ends would function as speakers and microphones, which in an acoustic medium are the equivalent of read and write heads!<p>The system memory would be a collection of these columns, each I guess storing one bit. The memory would of course have to be refreshed: when the signal arrived at the other end, it would be fed back into the column, assuming I suppose that there wasn't a new signal waiting to be written to that bit instead. The article mentions that this was not randomly accessible memory, but rather serially accessible. From that and other bits of information, I gather that the device would visit each bit in sequence, according to some clock, and produce a signal on the read line corresponding to the value in that bit. You had to wait for the memory device to read out the particular bit you were waiting for.<p>Does anyone know if this a correct understanding of how this kind of storage worked?

This will require service of process, which will be initially hard, but there are fallbacks in case the person is deliberately making themselves unreachable, like publishing service in newspapers, etc.<p>2a.

Send a copy of the endorsed subpoena (keep the original since you are likely to end up playing mail tag a few times)   to the address paypal provides.\nAgain, i don't have this address handy, but as a registered corporation, you should be able to lookup where they receive service of process. They are <i>required</i> to have a registered agent that accepts service of process.<p>If they fail to respond, file a motion to enforce the subpoena (this is covered in the URL linked above in the case of northern district, if it's another local court subpoena, they will have a similar way).<p>They do have a fraud investigation team which you could contact with the subpoena first, and see if they will respond.\nThey may work only with law enforcement.<p>Again none of this is legal advice, there may be intermediate or more steps, i'm not responsible if the steps are not right or in the right order, or if following these steps causes you to lose all your legal rights, etc.",1354698488

This worked well for conventional (non-clustered, non-accelerated) password cracking mechanisms.<p>Sadly, this starts to fall apart with accelerated and/or distributed cracking. On average I crack a few hundred passwords a week, and more often than not organisations have what I call seed words (e.g. the password reset word or common words used throughout the organisation) and the majority of passwords are variants of them.<p>My own ability to crack passwords for most algorithms (within a reasonable timeframe) tends to cap at dictionary words with number and letter substitution and somewhere around the 8-10 character mark. Using a phrase means that as an attacker you have to account for other people using more complex but shorter passwords. I'd still suggest getting capitalisation, punctuation or at least a number in your phrase but the bulk of the keyspace comes from the length rather than complexity plus the fact that the people carrying out these attacks are normally cracking more than one password at a time.<p>For a few years now (since around the time of Oeschlin's paper[1]) I've been advising customers to use longer passwords made of phrases and things they can remember for passwords they regularly use[2] and randomly generated passwords of some length stored in a password safe[3] for things they might forget.
