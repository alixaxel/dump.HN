So you cannot play DRMed media on a open-source player, but only players blessed by the DRM-vendor.

You have authentication where none is needed, exclusively to give the vendor power, not to provide the end-user with benefits.<p>Both are about digital data/signals and having artificial restrictions imposed on them.

'Expression Suite' was built on Microsoft's acquisition of Creature House in 2003, and their fabulous Expression vector graphics software (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creature_House_Expression"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creature_House_Expression</a>).<p>At the time, Expression was the closest competitor to Adobe Illustrator: it had unique features ('skeletal strokes', based on the co-founders' PhD research), and a superb UI (yes, imagine a streamlined, friendly interface that was <i>different</i> to Adobe's!). The animation version of Expression, LivingCels, offered similarly innovative animation technology, which was seriously being looked upon as a competitor to Flash. More significantly, though, it was on course to disrupt the (cel-based) animation industry. There's an informational site at: <a href=""http://livingcels.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://livingcels.com</a><p><i>That's</i> why Microsoft bought the company.<p>So, the little things: Creature House bought back the rights to Expression after MetaCreations went down. (I <i>wish</i> they'd do so now, once more!) The wonderfully whimsical website with beautiful, funny illustrations (by Patrick Lee) was replaced fairly rapidly by Microsoft's soulless corporate rendition. There was a Mac version of Expression - abandoned. Then the Windows version was re-coded to fit into WPF (dropping lots of essential features along the way). LivingCels has vanished.<p>I still use Expression almost daily. It runs perfectly in WINE (especially important now, since the Mac version isn't Intel-compatible). The user manual is a brilliant example of how manuals <i>should</i> be written, and the sample illustrations demonstrate how painterly effects can be achieved through vector gfx.<p>There's still nothing quite like Creature House Expression, so it's fortunate that Microsoft are still offering these original versions (Windows & Mac) as free downloads (check the links at the end of the Wikipedia article).",1356082983
