Ironically, when we work so hard and with such passion on perfecting our craft and producing output worth sharing, we often dont find the time to share it.<p>Maybe it's because I've been thinking a lot lately about how I should start blogging about my life experiences, that this stood out for me right now. I am guilty of #12  I find myself so deep in working that I forget to pull out and actually take time to self-reflect, write about it, and share it. I think reserving time to write and share your experiences can be a helpful part in the ""perfecting our craft and producing output worth sharing"" process.

You can get dedicated hardware h264 encoders easily (and relatively cheaply), not to mention the decoders in mobile devices. There's also quality to consider, effective quality per MB (important when targeting mobile devices), and all the things that fall into that (motion handling, prediction, etc).<p>I don't claim to be an expert, but from what I've read Ogg & WebM are fighting an uphill battle on the technical side of things.
