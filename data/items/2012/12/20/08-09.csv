The artist (from the 1850's) is being exhibited because of his links to XYZ (the guy with the most expensive photograph ever sold at auction, linked above, in 2011). The Guy XYZ is a student of Becher (==New Topographics), the former a Pioneer of the original aesthetic now called Topographic/s. That, in a nutshell is the point I was making. Interesting stuff was happening in the 1800's. In Art. With Photography.<p><i>I didn't say photography was unimportant. I said that it's hard to defend your statement that photography is the most important of the arts. I don't see you defending that statement.</i><p>== I don't need to. Its not critical to the point.<p>If you have a true interest in the subject matter, its worth looking into further. I would encourage other HN readers to do the same, if they have an interest in it. The interesting stuff in contemporary photography is well-beyond what you've listed. I'd take that as an opportunity to learn more about the subject, rather than taking it personally. For the most part, it is German and Japanese leading the way.

And if enough of us want to change the law to put IV and it's clones out of business, we can do it. This place is our home, our nation, and we get to decide what's allowed here.

It's the same respect given to influential bankers in Wall St and London, it was the same respect given to Bush, the same respect given to wealthy men accused of rape and murder who never serve time. Any and every action taken against these entities seems to either melt away entirely or result in a slap on the wrist. Meanwhile people who hack celebrity emails get 10 years hard time.

Organizations that follow the letter of the law but ignore the principles behind them should inspire our strongest contempt. Their existence's only positive value is as a clarion call to vigorous action by our legislators to amend the law to close the gap between the letter and spirit. The longer we wait, the less legitimacy the rule of law has.<p>Our elected officials, the people we keep voting into office cycle after cycle, are far more interested in playing their political games. They do have some time leftover to actually govern. But governing takes common sense, and whatever they have is shattered by lobbyists who's only job is to undermine common-sense with smooth-sounding arguments - or, if that doesn't work, threats of withdrawing campaign support. Our leaders are dazzled by arguments of complexity when the heart of the problem is genuinely, truly simple:<p>Introduce and pass a bill to eliminate software patents, retroactively, and do it now.",1355992121
