4903821,comment,4902960,4903637,6,0,drewcrawford,,,"> If including a more reasonable plan for higher priced purchases allowed a greater volume into the store, then that could help make up the difference.<p>As the old saying goes, if you lose money on each sale, you can't make it up in volume.  If it is indeed true that Apple makes no or very little money from the App Store, it would require a huge, order-of-magnitude-shift, 10x, 100x, in purchase behavior to translate into raising $2b.<p>> I also question the assumption that they continue to need this level of revenue.<p>You and I can sit in our comfy chairs and question it, but unfortunately neither of us are in a position to run app stores, and the people who do don't provide a lot of transparency about how much it really costs.  I do think if it was possible to do it for less, that Amazon or Google would undercut Apple (Amazon, in particular, has an incentive to run their store below cost).  Seeing as how they don't, I'm inclined to believe 30% is very close to the actual cost.<p>I also think that solving the multinational billing/legal problem is much more difficult than many developers realize.  The iOS app store recently opened in Chad, which is consistently ranked as one of the most difficult countries to do business with according to several international organizations [1].  Forget ""formalities"" like it taking 63 days to start a business or an effective tax rate of 65% that takes 732 hours per year to calculate [2], and worry about ""informalities"" like the government officials openly soliciting bribes to get electricity turned on to your office.  Or try operating in India, where it takes 1,420 days to enforce contracts [3] or in the Congo where it costs 7x what it does in a Western country to import a shipping container [4].  I have customers in all of these countries through the iOS app store.<p>I bring up the cost of doing business in foreign countries, not only because it's expensive, but also because it's the factor to which Apple attributes its 2011 App Store growth.  In a SEC-audited filing, the line item including the app store went up ""primarily [due] to increased net sales from the iTunes Store, which was largely driven by App Store expansion into new countries that contributed to strong growth in all of the Companys geographic segments.""  Basically, Apple's growth in the App Store is driven mostly by selling the product of first-world payment transactions to second and third-world countries.  For this reason, the legal and accounting infrastructure behind Apple's various stores are probably among the most complex business processes that exist anywhere in the world.<p>[1] <a href=""http://rru.worldbank.org/BESnapshots/Chad/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rru.worldbank.org/BESnapshots/Chad/default.aspx</a>

Put (1) + (2) into a shell script so they run immediately after each other.  Put a loop around it so it tries over and over again.  Bang => data corruption.<p>(b) It's a data corrupter.

To get the first 1,000 users, it might be useful to target a niche segment, rather than a catch-all segment.<p>Also, this site seems similar to quora.com. People ask questions on quora, whereas you are soliciting reasons. Yes, I can see how there is a slight differentiation here. So it might be useful to actuall really make it more explicit, probably through sample posts, what kind of content are you trying to capture here that makes you different from asking a question on quora.com.<p>Probably the content can be more compelling. Asking questions like ""why I should exercise?"" may not really interest the average visitor. I probably already expect more than half the answers there. More compelling content could be questions like ""why are people allowed to carry guns in the states?"". And then users can try to frame these questions in the reasons2-esque style: ""Reasons for allowing guns in the states"". Such content sounds a lot more compelling, and might motivate users to sign up and participate in such a 'forum' of sorts.<p>There certainly is potential.

Well, of course in this case you're losing money as long as you don't rent it.

Now of course one could claim one's using and enjoying the extra-space beyond the 40sq m.

- Your peak productivity can only be reached if you are not disturbed every five minutes from the work you are doing on your computer. We all know that focus is important, and indeed it is hard to focus in a noisy environment. I remember that the guys at GitHub have some kind of ""no live talk"" rule : if you need to speak to someone, do it on the internal chat room, even if he's litterally 1 meter away from you. It has several advantages : you can choose when you want to read messages and when you want to reply to them. If you're in the middle of a hardcore debugging session, you are free to continue. It also has the big advantage that chat can be recorded and reviewed and searched at a later date : live speech can't  or at least not easily.
- On the other hand, if you're in the phase of a project where you need a lot of interaction with other people and where it would be to cumbersome to do it via chat, like when you're trying to design your architecture, or when trying to agree on rules, specs, etc... Then just set up a meeting : that's what they are for.",1355217165
