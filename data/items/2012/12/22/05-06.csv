4955910,comment,4954905,4954905,5,0,Xcelerate,,,"Here's a weird thing about randomness that has always bothered me:<p>In quantum mechanics, if you measure two incompatible observables (like position and momentum) of a system, and then repeat that experiment many times, you will get two lists of real numbers.  QM says you can predict the distribution of these numbers, but you cannot predict the individual numbers themselves.  The popular way of thinking nowadays is that ""the universe is just inherently random"".<p>So I posed the question on the Physics Stack Exchange: how do we know these numbers are truly random, and not the result of some as-yet-undiscovered pseudorandom number generator that is nonetheless deterministic?  Lubo Motl (Czech string theorist) replied (a bit abrasively I might add) that yes, the numbers are truly random and plenty of experiments have ruled out the loopholes.  Now, there's no way to determine if a set of numbers are truly random, so how he made this bold matter-of-fact statement is beyond me.<p>Einstein initially believed in ""hidden variable"" theories, undiscovered properties of quantum systems.  Most of these have been ruled out by experiment (this is what Lubos mentioned), but really, this doesn't apply at all to my question of whether those numbers are random or not.  Superdeterminism seems to still allow non-randomness, but for some reason, most physicists (notably excepting Gerard t'Hooft) have discounted superdeterminism as nonsense.",1356155938

4955882,comment,4954170,4955473,1,0,lifesavers,,,"In general I agree with your ideas, but I think there's a missing component: general use case. Most people only need their computers for email and web browsing. We can further simplify that and just call it - communicating.<p>Sure, a developer or designer salivates at the idea of more screen real estate, but that's because there's a practical use for it. PC Manufacturers follow, not decide, the needs of their users.<p>I love my screen real estate because I actually need it. If I just browsed Facebook, wrote a word document, and maybe planned out my finances with a spreadsheet - I'd have a hard time justifying some giant monolith of a monitor. I think this is a largely overlooked factor in the success of the mobile market.<p>I don't know if everyone's forgot this already but when the iPad first came out, most people were thinking: what in the actual eff is Apple thinking. Sure we all knew it'd sell because, well, Apple is Apple. But if I recall correctly most people were scratching their heads asking, ""so, it's a big iPhone right?""<p>And guess what? It is just a big iPhone! And it succeeded NOT because it was the next ""cool"" thing but because it was designed to do what most people needed their computer to do, namely, send pictures of their grandkids to each other.",1356155002

4955876,comment,4954581,4955845,5,0,snprbob86,,,"I don't think that this style is fantastic. This means that the pair of success/error callbacks is not reified, so there isn't a single object to pass around or manipulate. The result is that composition is harder. In order to create higher order asynchronous operations, like those in Async.js [1], you need to either pass two arguments or use an array or object to pair the error handlers together. This is particularly important if you want to return a pair of handlers from a function.<p>In the two-callback model, the most common way to reify the handler pair is with a {success:...,error:...} object. This is much better than function(x,y,z,success,error), but still has the problem that you now need to override two handlers if you want to wrap some completion logic, regardless of success/failure. For example, if you want to close a file handle, win or lose, you need to provide two new functions.<p>Composition greatly benefits from a singular object. The Node.js approach is the (err,data) callback. It's an extremely simple and successful approach. The other approach are promises/futures, which internally can be implemented with one or more callbacks, but provide a nice clean interface for composition. You could get that with success/error objects, but you're exposing the internals rather than an interface, like you should be doing. A good promise interface would let you choose an implementation without tying you to any particular callback model.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/caolan/async"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/caolan/async</a>",1356154814

It will constitute random noise in a business famous for the level of random noise.<p>* If a trader has a large stake, publishing his portfolio and his moves will have nothing but advantages to him, and nothing but disadvantages to his followers.<p>Consider Berkshire-Hathaway. The reason Berkshire-Hathaway does better than the DJIA year after year is because of all the uneducated fools who follow its moves -- too late for them to benefit, but just in time for Berkshire-Hathaway to benefit (because the latter already has a position before news of its trades becomes public).<p>To put it simply, publishing one's trades is only advantageous to the publisher, never to the reader. Experienced investors know this, so they won't bother to subscribe. Inexperienced investors don't know this, so they might subscribe, until they realize their mistake, then they will bad-mouth the enterprise.<p>Bottom line: before embarking on this plan, you need to learn how equities work.",1356154661

I expect this to scale quite a bit and may become very popular. Given that option I am thinking I want the best technology for the job, even if it's something I don't know and will have to learn. Here are the options I'm considering:<p>Node.js service\nAsp.Net Service\nPHP script<p>Database:<p>Most likely MySQL or MS-SQL.<p>My question is, what do you guys suggest? I know that NO-SQL stuff is all the craze right now, but I don't feel really comfortable with keeping a lot of data in one of these stores without knowing a lot about them. I have extensive experience with MySQL and MS-SQL and trust both of them can do the job great.<p>The interface on the other hand is much more open. It's just going to be pushing text (images will be hosted on S3) so anything that serves text quickly will work. Heavily leaning towards Node.JS for this, but I'm not set yet.<p>Any advice or input would be great. I expect at least a couple thousand users right from the start, so it will need to be pretty fast. If it takes off it will need to scale up, which is why I may do a Node/MySQL arrangement on Linode so I can just scale up the servers as needed.<p>Another note: this isn't going to make much money, if any. So a pure .NET/MS-SQL solution may not be the best choice if I have to keep buying expensive servers for a project not likely to ever gain revenue.<p>Anyway any thoughts you guys might have would be great!",1356154491

On Android, though (and jailbroken iOS), I can definitely see people writing mods to break this right away.<p>I don't think that this technique (even in a more complicated form) could ever be exploit-proof. Even with more randomness or noise, a computer can ultimately compute the same averaging that our eyes are doing, and could always get the source image back.<p>There's an even easier exploit too: just record the screen with another device.",1356154299

Thus, a camera with a sufficiently long exposure would capture it just the same. What it does prevent is screenshots, taken internally by the device - which generally don't do averaging or have a concept of ""exposure"".  Of course, that could be implemented, but it's not standard at present.<p>He mentions using more than two frames - a less precise approach is to just add massive random noise over an indefinite number of frames (a noisy video of a static image), and instead of taking care that they cancel out, just rely on statistical convergence.  Depending on how much noise is added, it gets more difficult to see the original.<p>I guess there's a risk that only a little noise is added in some frames, revealing the person. So perhaps instead of adding random noise, you use offsets of <i>a legitimate face</i>.  This would make either single frame actively misleading, and perhaps not obviously distorted. Your eyes wouldn't be deceived (I think...), because they average the pixels, like a long exposure.<p>Also, one could selectively apply the technique - as google street-view blurs out people's faces, but nothing else.  This might reduce the flicker.",1356154255

I am the first to admit that I am very, very, very lucky in a variety of ways that made this possible. But one of them is as follows.<p>I similarly have a hard time focusing for long periods of time. Like many people, while I'm not manic-depressive, I have manic-depressive tendencies. For a week or two I feel depressed and don't want to do anything. Then for a week or two I'm really excited about research and get a ton done. Then back to depressed. It's just the way I am, and my situation doesn't seem very unique from talking to many of my friends. Sometimes research is inspiring, sometimes it's frustrating and tedious. I think much of that is perception, and that really all that's changing is a fundamental chemical shift in your moods.<p>In any case, what I realized back in undergrad is that when I'm in a depressed mood, I <i>don't work</i>. At least, not on creative, difficult, interesting stuff. It's just impossible, intimidating, frustrating, and a waste of my time. All it does it work to prolong my depression.<p>Instead, I focus on what I call cultivating boredom. I do things like read hacker news until I've read all the articles. Or god forbid read slashdot. Or NPR. Or meditate. Or much better; practice karate, go for a walk, take mind altering substances (you know, like nicotine), hang out with friends, cook, that sort of stuff. Sure, I still take care of the little logistical things that need doing, but I don't try to do creative work when I'm in this mood. It's counterproductive.<p>Instead, I basically use up all my avenues of distraction, and eventually doing that creative, hard, difficult, complicated work becomes attractive again in comparison with sitting at my computer reading facebook. This process takes about 3-4 days. Then, I suddenly just... flip. And then I'm manic again, and I'm roaring through piles of highly creative work that is of incredibly good quality.<p>So instead of wearing myself out doing superficial tasks, I try to actually <i>let myself rest</i> and most importantly, become bored so that my mind can recover. This is the only way I have found to work productively as a graduate student.<p>It's only anecdotal, of course, but I probably worked an average of 25 hours a week. I'd spend two weeks straight working 9-10 hour days and then coming home and writing grants and papers and thesis. Then I'd burn myself out and do literally nothing worth even remembering for two weeks. And after two weeks of that I'd be bored and really excited about working a ridiculous amount again. And in this way, I managed to graduate in 4.5 years, in a lab where the median graduate student was in their 5th year, and many were in their 7th year. It's quality of work, not quantity of work, nor time spent in lab that lets you graduate.<p>Anyway, worked for me. Might not work for you. Try at your own risk. But I've never found another way to work that makes me happy, lets me get through my depressive periods in a reasonable period of time, and which produces high quality creative work products.",1356153817

I felt that instead of making me more productive, they were just introducing more overhead into my life for things that I was already able to handle by myself. I don't have a problem prioritizing and remembering tasks in my life, so apps like that end up being more expensive to me in terms of time and energy than using nothing at all. They just feel gimmicky. And if something is so unimportant that I can't remember I have to do it, then it's probably not worth doing at all.<p>As for the list... it's funny the way it caters mostly to iOS users.

I am not an expert, so you've all been warned:<p>I actually like the Exec redesign, except for 1) the awful gold color, and 2) the bottom half of the page. After the 1-2-3-steps the layout gets a little bipolar (no pun intended) and cluttered with a two-columned layout. I would've put all those elements in a single column. But I actually find the overall layout of the upper half to be more intuitive than Exec's actual design.<p>Not a fan of the Flutter redesign. The actual Flutter page is really cool and unique, even if at the expense of readability. The redesign looks like every other startup/app landing page.<p>Ditto for the Pebble redesign. It looks too ""corporate."" The actual Pebble site has less clutter and a warmer feel to it.<p>Big fan of the Instacart redesign. A lot better use of limited space, and the foldout detail panel is definitely something Instcart should have. Instacart's current design of having a rotating bar of categories is really unintuitive and pretty bad design IMO.<p>I think having other people redesign your website/app is actually a great thing, because it's a way of getting different perspectives. Too often we optimize for the local max (moving a button around) instead of looking at the big picture (wondering if we even need that button in the first place). Designers at Apple, for example, create 10 entirely different designs for each new feature, which is whittled into 3, and after more work on those three they decide on one design.",1356153236

Printing a 3D gun is somewhat viable but a 3D printer is not a dispenser where you can just press a button and a perfectly crafted glock pops out for your 5 year old.  1) You have to have strong enough materials for the casing 2)  The inner surface of your barrel better be smooth (something even high precision 3d printers are relatively bad at)  3) If 1 or 2 is in any way flawed its going to be your own hand thats blown off - better get it right.<p>3D printing is going to have to compete with a global distribution system that is already extremely efficient.  Take for example coffee cups - great example of something to print but I'd probably never print a coffee cup.  Why? Because they are damn cheap and ubiquitous.  By the time I get done with downloading the model, purchasing the materials, printing the cup, preparing the surface (shining, painting, whatever) Ive spent more time and money than just hopping over to Walmart and spending a few bucks.  Guns within the rings of people who want them in mass who you are mostly likely worried about are in a similar situation - they can get one down the street.<p>On top of it, 3D printing currently competes pretty much only with the lower tier of manufacturing... stuff made out a single material with usually at most a few parts.  Whenever I see what can be done with a 3D printer its honestly not that compelling - toys, utensils, models, etc.  I think 3D printing has potential but also think it will be a long time until everyone is printing everything they want.",1356152900

The initial obvious solution was to randomly roll if they get a new weapon every X minutes of gameplay.  This lead to players getting long unlucky streaks where they got little to no gameplay.  They eventually changed it to when you get a weapon drop, it rolls to see how long you have to play until you get a new weapon.  Players can be unlucky still, but it's drastically better.<p>The other example was in civilization they showed percentage chances of winning a battle.  The problem is that when a player would have three battles with say a 50% chance of winning and lost them all, they would get very frustrated.  So they changed it to be much more like the average person perceives statistics to be.
