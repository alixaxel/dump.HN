It will just take a little while longer for those jobs to be replaced by artificial intelligence.<p>The concept of superstars v. the rest is mainly just a weak argument attempting to cover for the tendency of monopolies to form in any economy.

I did a ""git add remote"", logged in to my university's VPN, ""git fetch"", and was up and running with my latest changes from Friday.<p>If that didn't make any sense, well, the <i>gist</i> of it is that the outage wouldn't affect development work in the slightest, thanks to the fact that every repository is a) content addressable, so you have consistency between servers and b) self-contained, so you have a complete copy everywhere.

And to push your apple vs IBM analogy farther, it seems that they could potentially still win, by building a product that is far and away better for a certain segment of the market (i.e. as apple did).<p>To address the deeper philosophical claim -- are big companies morally obligated in some sense, to not encroach on ideas currently dominated by some startup, I think not. The whole crux of your argument is that there's some well ordering on the timestamp of ideas, and whoever is earlier in the well ordering has some moral claim to executing the idea. As far as I can see, there's no a priori reason why this should be so, and there are lots of utilitarian reasons why this ought not be so. Just because someone came up with the idea does not mean they are the best agent to execute the idea. I might be a brilliant military tactician, but I might lack the charisma or fortitude to lead an army. In the same way, I might be a brilliant social based startup, but my same product under the influence of the most complete social graph might be tons better.<p>I am not saying facebook poke is better than snapchat. I don't use either, but I do think competition is healthy. Now what would be problematic is if startups did -- as your article asserts -- stop having original ideas just because they were afraid big companies would clone them. In that case, the government should probably seriously consider penalizing companies like facebook for scooping up the idea, if not by making them disable the app completely, but by making them retroactively purchase or pay a large sum to snapchat. I don't have any data to discern whether a ""chill"" effect is happening, but I would guess an answer in the negative.",1356230359

If I have a monopoly on umbrellas, I get to control everybody else's umbrella too, and get to call on the government to have that enforced.)""<p>I believe the above was meant to addresses your specific form of criticism.<p>I've said it before, and I'll say it again...<p>""imaginary property"" != ""real property""<p>importanceof(""real property"") > importanceof(""imaginary property"")<p>I believe my right to exist stems from my ""inalienable property right"" to my own body. I can move it left and right and up and down. If someone were to try to take that away from me, I'd be pretty upset and I'd do more than write my representative.<p>Whereas, the basic idea of copyright is to encourage sharing of ideas - it doesn't actually have a basis as an inalienable or ""moral right."" In order to encourage sharing ideas, societies have been allowing the encroachment of imaginary property rights (a euphemism for the independent traditions of copyright, patents, and trademaks) on tangible and even inalienable property rights (making it uncomfortable to say the least). The Internet, however, has shaken even that basic premise: the Internet is full of creativity (not just copyright infringement). Only a fool would ""buy"" water in the rain.<p>We should not be allowing, condoning, or financially supporting, any unneeded encroachment on tangible rights, so IMHO we should dismantle copyright as we know it. What's more: copying itself has social value that should not simply be dismissed.<p>This whole conflict is about preserving the front-loaded pricing (CDs and DVDs that can sit on a store shelf) that the biggest music and movie publishers only became accustomed to this century, after the phonograph. (OK, the printing press was  around a little longer before that, but scribes couldn't help read the book they were copying...) As awkward as it is for these biggest ""creators"" (distributors) to return to a gratuity system (beg? never!), this change only affects the biggest publishers and employers, not creators generally.<p>The moral argument for copyright is an illusion: it's a confusion of the right to privacy with the right to have monopoly control over distribution. I support the former but not the latter.<p>For independant artists and creators, the Internet is the best opportunity ever to realize their vision, to distribute it directly, and to capitalize on it directly... But the tip only comes after the meal.<p>I believe the long-term implications of this conflict were explored further by Cory Doctorow in the following:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbYXBJOFgeI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbYXBJOFgeI</a><p>Do you also disagree with him?",1356229436

First, an entirely only service driven site.  Second, something that involves a product or inventory.<p>It seems that a startup that has something to sell feels a little easier on the surface.  But with that comes what seems to me a ton more logistical problems.  Warehouse space, shipping, receiving, inventory.  Just the programming alone to support those additional aspects kicks up the daunting aspect a bit.<p>Then there are the completely online startups.  Sites like reddit, kickstarter, etc, where there is no inventory, nothing to ship.  A service is provided, and you make money off the service, advertising, or selling something the service has gained.<p>I have actively avoided any ideas that end up having inventory and real product.  Should I throw this out the window and consider it not that big a deal?<p>In my earlier years I have started a few businesses, all of which had product that needed to be shipped.  I remember those days, deadlines, UPS, FedEx, everything was dictated by 4PM, which was when the UPS guy came.  6PM of we were really pushing it and wanted to take the stuff to the main hub, which wasn't always feasible if it was a large order of 2000 boxes.<p>Any comments?",1356229327

If you were the one in charge of guaranteeing the safety of that person, its a failure much deeper and more profound than the worst startup company failure. Most people will be willing to do <i>anything</i> to prevent the loss of another life on their watch. The monitoring of communications seems almost small in comparison to the lengths that many would go to.<p>There are practical reasons for government monitoring of communications. Bad people have existed long enough that it's safe to assume the trend will continue. [1] Listening to their communications is the best way to stop them, or at least to ensure that they can't act openly. Very few innocent people will ever know that they're being monitored, and the risks to those people are very small.<p>Privacy could easily considered to be a basic right of all people. But it lives in a continuum like everything else that we value. Some times it's better if the government errs on the side of caution. And most of the time, people have nothing to hide.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_terrorist_incidents</a>",1356229301

He sells me a small bottle with a Tylenol label; I pop a couple and put the rest in my bag.  After I return home--declaring 'nothing' at the border, of course, since I forgot about the bottle of medicine--I find the bottle and notice the word 'Codeine' on the label.
