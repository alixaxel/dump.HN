Lots of screens are going to come out not 100% perfect. See Catleap as evidence that lots of panels come out with defects even at non-4k resolution.<p>Second of all, because the screens are harder to make and prices are high because of that, adoption is lower too. With lower adoption comes lower economies of scale which mean higher prices again. So two factors at least that push prices up.<p>We won't see low prices until they can improve the manufacturing process enough to drop the price, which will increase adoption, which will drop the price, which will increase adoption, etc..",1354957146
4891191,comment,4890788,4891174,1,0,manmal,,,"To avoid ""memory overload"", I have taken to literally ignoring parts of the system which I currently don't need. I.e., I don't even look at other classes' code before I don't need them. Else, I would have to spend 3 days of understanding it all. That's for very big programs, and of course I do look at the overall structure and what patterns have been used to couple classes together. But if a method promises something with a contract, I won't read through it, but treat it as a black box. My theory is that cognitive power is like money spent during the day. I can recharge it after a few hours by taking a nap of 20 minutes, but I better watch what I expend my cognitive credits for. And spending it all on reading other people's code (which has probably already been revised 10 times) is not worth it.",1354957107

Java's difficulties are all political.  Reading HN will show that regardless of any technical merits Java has, a large number of people will not use the JVM because they consider Java an uncool language or believe that it's still as slow as it was 10 years ago.<p>Personally, I'm excited about Google's new foray into this territory.  While I believe that the JVM is a better option right here and now, coding fashionistas aren't going to touch Java and Oracle's litigious attitude is likely to repel people who would invest in the platform expanding on the web.  I believe a bytecode for the web is absolutely the best solution and I want it to happen whoever provides the technology.  If Google's attempt gets used, it will get optimised and maybe in a decade be as performant as the JVM is now.  That is preferable to Javascript being the ONLY game in town.",1354957019

I just couldn't do it whether through laziness, inability to concentrate or whatever.

Later it might become obvious that a certain part would have been better done another way and if there's a serious benefit to changing things I can do it at that stage.<p>It's only after a lot of work's already been done that I'd be able to produce some kind of spec for the program<p>Having a spec that lays everything out beforehand is to me analagous to a mathematician writing the final proof of a theorem before doing all the thinking.",1354956922

(except when you actually begin coding it - for this early  stage of development I agree with PG).

Now it's obvious why having a big working memory makes you a great programmer - everything usually starts as a BBOM or ends up as one, but the point is to fight this tendency...<p>Once a program grows, you should architecture it so that you only need to keep the piece that you're working on in your head, ie it should be a network of black-boxes and you should only need to open the one you're currently working at, and even when you do things like large scale refactoring, you should be able to selectively and partially open only some of the boxes to do your job - and this is what programming languages and patterns should help you do!",1354956607

4891131,comment,4890788,4891033,3,0,mpweiher,,,"I think OO was a first (and pretty good) stab at the problem. The primary goal was recursion, so having things be self-similar, and Alan's insight was to make the small things look like the big things (lots of little computers interacting), rather than making the big things look like the small things (everything is a function,...)<p><a href=""http://www.smalltalk.org/smalltalk/TheEarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk_Introduction.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smalltalk.org/smalltalk/TheEarlyHistoryOfSmalltal...</a><p>Back in 1972, we obviously didn't have a lot of ""big things"" (e.g. large distributed systems) to look at, so instead analogies and intuition were used.   Considering, the results are not too shabby, IMHO.<p>Nowadays we have the Interwebs, a huge distributed system that appears to work most of the time, and so one might ask if we can apply the same principle and get newer and possibly better results:  if we want self-similarity, should our computations internally look like the web?<p>We also have lots of experience with the systems we've built, and things like the Patterns books that tell us where our means of capturing common behavior fall short (if it's a pattern, it's repetitive; if it's repetitive, I should have been able to factor out the common parts).<p>So I am not sure ""failed"" is the right way to describe it.  As another poster pointed out, we are now capable of building much larger systems than before, and OO seems to be largely responsible for that.<p>Another perspective is that Smalltalk (again) was never intended to be something final, but rather a basis for obsoleting itself, so describing OO as failed seems akin to calling the first stage of a Saturn V a failure because it didn't get to the moon.<p>Where I do see a failure is that we entered an age of stagnation, and rather than see OO as a first stage to build even better things on top of, we pretty much stopped.  And in that sense, I guess OO did fail, because the second and third stages that were supposed to get us to the moon didn't really get built.",1354955104

If I had to imagine a motor/generator that'd be likely to work on a direct-drive to a falling weight it'd probably be several feet in diameter. (For model plane motors, the diameter of the motor is a significant factor in the kV constant and the rpm at max efficiency. Small diameter motor spin fast, large diameter motors spin slow.)",1354954827
