4941689,comment,4939902,4941599,6,0,spartango,,,"As a bit of background: a lot of the performance pain around EBS is the inconsistency in performance between IOs. Many times you'll get a nice fast op, but sometimes IOs will get slow suddenly, or even stuck. You can imagine that internally, this is EBS seeking on magnetic disks or getting blocked by a clogged network. Regardless, inconsistent performance is nearly as bad (or perhaps worse) than consistently bad performance in certain cases:<p>Thus, most of the time, performance issues with EBS bite you when you have application data on an EBS volume. If you're constantly hitting the volume to serve data to customers, you'll be seeing the hiccups in EBS performance and passing them right on to customers. Clearly this is a suboptimal experience, and can lead to other failure modes; a slow/stuck bunch of ops can get an application to completely stall.<p>It's important to note here that EBS has no error reporting system or timeouts; common operating systems aren't very good at handling disk IO errors, so EBS will never produce them, even when its having issues. This lack of transparency can make handling/working around stuck EBS operations nigh impossible.<p>So, having experienced these pains, people generally say ""Don't constantly use EBS if you care about your application performance/stability,"" and they aren't wrong.<p>That said, if you use EBS as a boot volume only, you are likely not hitting that volume enough to feel the pain of slow-IOs; once booted you won't touch it much. At the same time, using EBS as a boot volume has all kinds of conveniences: the ability to start and stop the instance without loosing data, snapshots and AMI creation, persistent machine-specific configuration, etc.<p>I hope that's useful. EBS is not a perfect service, but it definitely has its uses. EBS as a boot volume has made using AWS quite a bit friendlier.<p>Note: I worked on the EBS team at AWS a few years ago. I currently use EBS in my startup's infrastructure. If you have further questions, feel free to reach out to me.",1355906071

Given the economic reality that poets, artists, philosophers alike aren't going to paid very well, its actually foolish to think otherwise.<p>Unless you are sure you have a good story to narrate, something that has best seller material- training to be novelist is an utter waste of your time. And taking big loans to do it is financial suicide. The net result is you ending up being a junior editor of sorts working for some portal trying to correct spelling mistake in news articles submitted, sincerely hoping automation doesn't take over your job.<p>'Making a living' is a very different thing, and frankly kids need to be taught its one thing to be passionate about something, and totally an another thing to monetize it. Your passion might not even be in demand to the common masses, you can't blame them for it. I for once never felt the need to listen to poetry. On the other hand I love listening to songs. Its not the worlds mistake to not want what you like doing. And moreover its not necessary your passion must always overlap with your day job. You can try towards doing that. But don't bet your whole life and financial security on it.<p>Next comes, a realization that needs to get into young people early on. Unless you are super lucky, big money will come only with big work. Studying history or philosophy is not very valuable to the world, or at least there isn't a pressing demand for it.<p>When you look at all this things at once. People need to make pragmatic choices in life. Choices which make sense. Again you can point out examples of people who have made it big doing something non-mainstream, but I promise they will be so few you can count such people on your fingers.",1355905125

4941663,comment,4940434,4941148,9,0,zanny,,,"I am in this exact age group, and my circumstances are almost similar.  I got lucky, my family is very close knit so I'm able to live with my mother, and up to 3 relatives have given me opportunities to move in if my mother couldn't handle me playing parasite.<p>I made the dumb mistake of going to a small private college for CS.  There were only 2 professors in the department and at most around 8 seniors, so we had an insanely good professor to student ratio.  Problem is, the career center had <i>no</i> connections in the tech industry and as a result I have been trying to solo my way into a software job having graduated in 3 years with my bachelors with a 3.3 gpa and no internships since the year I was planning to have one in the summer, I found out I could graduate early so I took the chance.<p>Then I found out almost <i>every</i> intern opportunity requires an active .edu email or some other validation to show you are an active student.  So I'm in the awkward position where I'm working on FOSS projects whenever I can, while playing homemaker for my mother to ""earn my keep"", and trying to get a leg in.<p>But the real getter is that I am not some rock star coder.  I'm not really good at it, at all.  I don't have great recall of the myriad of algorithms (I know what A* is, but would have to Google a proper implementation).  Same with with a spline or a rope.  If I write software, I usually end up spending a few hours on ~300 lines just debugging it into a working state with a standard library reference open the whole time.  I understand the languages I use - I can write regexes, I know locks, etc, but I usually just hit some gap in my knowledge snag that gets me caught up for a while.  For example, I was trying to use Python subprocess to do some calls into nvidia-settings and various other fan controllers(I was writing a script to intelligently control my machines fans since the default Linux fan controls kind of suck).  Took me 3 hours to figure out that the best way to get standard out was to use subprocess.check_output because temp files as pipes didn't work (at least for me).<p>So all my interviews so far have basically gone the same way - I don't produce perfect code from memory, and as a result I don't get consideration (there are more reasons than that, but I get the impression), especially without any past employment experience and only 2 personal projects (which are really just scripts) across github and gitorious. I also have an awful personality most people can't relate to - I'm an introverted cynic.  Even if I can try to fake behavior around others I always crack and act like myself again at some point.  I have a really hard time making small talk and being chummy, for example.<p>So I can relate to the large portion of the population that isn't an Elon Musk super-genius entrepreneur or some John Carmack coding god whose every line of code reads like prose that five hundred years from now professors will read off to CS students like Shakespeare.  I'm not even particularly average, because I have very little concrete experience - I just have a gigabyte of source files for homework and projects from school, a few commits to various FOSS projects that changed a line or two.  I'm <i>trying</i> to make something I can show off but I lack the imagination to come up with something novel that I can realistically build by myself in a month or two (since I'm always worried I might end up just like the kids in this article, out on the street).<p>Sorry for the rant, I just feel like the guy two posts up is kind of lucky to be talented.",1355904813

You need to bone up on how much one's socioeconomic class affect your chances at doing anything. Besides which, your suggestion does nothing about addressing how to enable people to be productive, it just says that you try and be better than those around you, which even if that works, still leaves all the people you beat to suffer and become a drag on society as a whole. It also completely avoids answering the question of why this is even happening in the first place.<p>Let me ask you this, would you have the same suggestion to someone who is homeless in India? If you've been to India you'd see how ignorant your thinking is. Why do you people think that the US is some magical place where dreams and wishes come true if you just work hard enough? It's the bullshit the politicians feed us to make you all think we're all millionaires in waiting. This is why we're all going to hell in a hand basket. You need to start taking more responsibility for our fellow citizens. You want to live a place where it's just up to the individual to ""make it"", go to the developing world and see how much you like it. The reason it's better in the West is because we all share, or at least used to, a similar standard of living. This homelessness in the youth affects you whether you like it or not. You won't like it very much when your town is crawling with them and unemployment is double digits.
