People get more news faster from voices on the ground in events like the Arab Spring than they ever did from a newspaper.  So for immediacy other avenues are arising.<p>Newspapers and media companies, have had no problem killing off their news departments in the name of profits - eliminating foreign desks, reducing investigative reporting, focusing on lifestyle reportage and opinion pieces.<p>High quality opinion writers are finding success as bloggers - some are able to make a perfectly good living as such.  They don't need the label of a newspaper to sit beneath any more.<p>There will always be outlets for investigative journalism.  There will always be some form of news show and publication.  Advertisers gain a certain value from placing their ads alongside high quality news content.  Just not enough to support billions of dollars of newspaper revenue.<p>If the commercial radio and TV stations disappeared from the Bay Area we'd still have NPR - a high quality news alternative.  Why?  Because there are a certain number of people always prepared to pay something for high quality content.<p>Long way of saying I think you're right - we'll end up with good journalism and no newspapers.",1354877998

<a href=""http://ceki.blogspot.de/2010/05/committocracy-as-alternative-for.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ceki.blogspot.de/2010/05/committocracy-as-alternative...</a><p>But still he is a community member and PMC of Apache Logging:
<a href=""http://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#logging-pmc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.apache.org/committers-by-project.html#logging-...</a><p>On the other hand, we (the Apache guys) are not liking how the logback project is operating. At least it is me who does not like it, but I guess the others think similar. We want a community driven logging project which uses the Apache License. We surely don't want a logging project which is officially run by a company (like QOS runs logback). I have seen many cases where this does lead into problems.<p>That said it will be difficult to motivate Ceki to get back to Apache Logging. But we are open to his contributions and hope that there will be a good, technical exchange between both projects.<p>Another personal note: I am really against person cult. The Apache Logging project has some really great and experienced committers on board. One of them is working on Java logging for around 20 years and he set a very, very high bar for log4j. Having Ceki on-board is definitely of interest, but he is not the only person who knows about logging.<p>Please have also in mind, that a new log4j2 release is just the beginning of our journey (hopefully).",1354877611

4886376,comment,4882291,4882291,13,0,richardjordan,,,"This ultimately comes down to the fact that newspapers are going out of business because not enough people want to buy them any more, and they're lashing out in desperation.<p>I think there's a simple argument with content and markets that all of these media companies disingenuously ignore.  If no-one is prepared to pay for your content then the market rate for your content is, by definition, zero.  We pay in two ways - direct purchasing, and delivering surplus attention beyond that required to consume the media, which can be redirected towards various forms of advertising.  When you cannot run your business on advertising revenue alone it means that not enough people are giving enough surplus attention of enough value to cover.<p>This argument about the ""inherent value"" of one form of content or another - of the need to pay artists or creators, or in this case journalists - doesn't extend to other realms.  If I decide I want to be a carpenter, I cannot build a table and demand someone buy that table for $1,000.  If the market won't bear that price for the table then the government isn't going to force others to pay me $1,000 because I feel that's what it's ""worth"".<p>The market rates for all forms of media have plummeted due to there being more supply of attention-draining media than there is demand either in terms of hard-dollars in direct payment, or surplus attention to be redirected towards paid advertising (and its ilk).<p>When old media companies had a stranglehold on distribution because paper production and distribution was expensive, or video production costs were prohibitive, only a small elite were able to publish their opinions, and the monopolistic distributors were able to charge a premium for the limited access to information or entertainment they provided.  They weren't paid well because they provided an outstanding product (though it often was), they were paid well because they limited supply.  Those limits are gone.  Many many people produce entertainment and informational content.  Many do it just for fun and are happy not to get paid.  Many more do it with the hope of getting paid anything without the expectation of the lavish salaries and expense accounts of journalists of old.<p>This undercuts their economics and doesn't even touch on the fact that the newer voices often offer media that is more attractive to younger audiences.  Not to mention declining quality of the product in many cases.  Many media companies as they've become bloated monstrosities have undermined their own product quality with short-term-profit-focused decision making which had long term harm.<p>Is it really the case that piracy accounts for all problems in a record industry where the giants spent the pre-Internet-boom '90s crushing independent labels, monopolizing market channels and creating a modern-day payola system on radio where programming was rigidly sliced and diced to the lowest common denominator?  Is none of the loss of popularity of the New York Times down to their abandoning their predominantly liberal subscriber audience during the Bush years and being guilty of mis-leading story after mis-leading story in the build up to the Iraq War, destroying people's confidence in their role as a reliable neutral arbiter?<p>tl;dr The publishers referenced by the OP aren't happy at the market rate for their product and services and want government to rig the market to pay them a cushy wage.  Such subsidies rarely save industries in the long term, and the public should be outraged - because legislation of this sort is a public subsidy on a privileged elite in no uncertain terms.",1354876912

Unless it's a fully automated car, where there's no driver at all.<p>And here that's not the case: a grandpa in a class S killed 5 workers on a french highway some time ago.  Cars full of gadgets assisting people who should never have been driving or who shouldn't be driving anymore are only going to give these a false sense of security.<p>Also : when you brake you always must take into account what's going behind you, not just what's in front.  Sometimes it's better to hit the car in front of you to give a little more room to the semi coming behind that is otherwise going to ruin your Class S and your life.

It's not harming me in any way, like it's not also harmful if they drink a bottle of beer on their way home in the subway, which is totally accepted also.<p>To claim that second-hand smoke is not harmful is utterly absurd. The same goes for alcohol consumption in public places. It's fine to have a drink on the subway, but who takes care of the shattered glass the following day[0]? If you're lucky, the local government will use ratepayer money to clean it up. If you're not lucky, it stays there indefinitely.<p>Frankly, I think that those who drink or smoke in public are being totally inconsiderate of others.<p>[0]: This wouldn't be such a big deal if glass bottles weren't so popular. Unfortunately, they are.",1354874467

Performance car manufacturers put a lot of effort into making their cars <i>sound</i> right - to my ears the more exotic Lambo/Ferrari/Aston engines sound much nicer - but that will just be my own cultural biases regarding what a performance car is supposed to sound like.",1354874436
