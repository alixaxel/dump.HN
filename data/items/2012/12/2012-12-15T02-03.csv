4924453,comment,4923076,4924114,1,0,harshreality,,,"No argument here; there's no clear evidence that fatalities would be dramatically reduced from these sorts of perpetrators if guns were not available. [1] Psychology is too variable to predict whether any particular killer would resort to less direct methods like bombs or poisoning if guns were not available to them.  Serial killers tend to prefer either more direct or less direct methods with not much cross-over (the same serial killer will almost never switch between strangling and poisoning, for instance), but I don't know if there's evidence of rampage killers having a similar bias in their selection of weapons/methods.<p>Also note the gender gap in rampage killers generally, and school rampage killers specifically. [ibid] Perhaps all males should be locked up until their obvious psychological faults, which contribute to this tendency, can be dealt with.<p>The problem with increasing sensitivity to mental health issues is the vagueness of some of the ""warning signs"".  Should society punish students for playing cowboys and indians on the playground, miming gunplay, drawing or writing about scenes involving killing?  Lots of adolescents who exhibit the same ""warning signs"" (though not going so far as to plan an attack or execute it) as school rampage killers turn out just fine without intervention.  What level of interference and ""reeducation"" of marginalized and/or antisocial students should be tolerated in the name of catching the small minority who go on to commit these heinous acts?<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rampage_killers</a>",1355540212

If that were the case it would make sense to say that chess is intrinsically harder than character recognition, even if humans have historically had a harder time discovering the recognition functions than the chess playing functions.<p>On your last paragraph there's a huge difference between a program discovering a good solution to a problem, which is what happens in machine learning, and a programmer discovering such a solution then creating a program to implement it.  In the first case we may begin to consider the program to be showing signs of intelligence while in the later it's just a really fast calculator which isn't doing anything the programmer couldn't do.<p>Is there circularity here - yes because we can say the same thing of the learning program if we treat it at a lower level of abstraction and therein lies perhaps the core of the problem of understanding what we mean by intelligence.",1355538147

First, since Thorium is a byproduct of Rare Earth Element mining and Uranium is mined specifically, there is all the mining waste that is saved.  
Second, since Thorium is used up ~completely and Uranium is used only about 0.5%, you need about 200 times more raw Uranium metal than Thorium meaning even MORE mining waste.
Third, all the extra metal is RadioActive Waste.
Fourth, in making the solid fuel elements, various reactants etc. become even more RAW.
Fifth, the pellets are clad, then assembled into bundles using metal that gets irradiated and becomes ever more RAW.
Sixth, the vast majority of the fuel pellet is U238 which gets irradiated and some becomes transUranic elements, significantly more than in a LFTR.
only then do the two become ALMOST equivalent in the amount of fission products made, though even there the LFTR can be substantially more efficient at turning heat into electricity, so less fuel needs to be converted.<p>Oh, and most fission products decay to stability in hours, some take years, a few take a few hundred years and the rest are transmutable.  It is the TRUs that represent the big storage problem.
