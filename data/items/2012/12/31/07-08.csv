4988734,comment,4987016,4987827,1,0,dkarl,,,"<i>Regarding your first point, Chomsky does agree with it, but you said ""his analysis.""</i><p>And you said he was ""quoting David Noble.""  Let's call it a draw and try to stick to more interesting questions.<p><i>you merely asserted that the plausibility of worker self-management is influenced by cultural variables</i><p>I didn't mean to address the plausibility of self-management so much as the desirability of it.  I didn't say it directly, but what I was questioning was the imperative to ""get rid of the bosses,"" which seems to rest on the notion that management, as a class above and condescending to the workers, enjoys an undeserved superior status.  Chomsky says they ""don't do anything but get in the way,"" but of course that is rarely the case, which is why we talk about ""worker self-management"" instead of ""workers and no management.""  If I see management as necessary work, if I do not feel demeaned relative to managers by my status as a non-manager, if I see management simply as a job that I find less attractive than my own, and if I want to exercise power over a very slim subset of management concerns (pay, working conditions, benefits) then where does my motivation to take over management responsibilities come from?<p>I think there's a very strong motive present in some cultures much more than in others, which is related to giving and receiving orders.  For some people, giving and receiving orders means that the person giving orders is higher and better than the person receiving them.  For others, giving and receiving orders simply means that the person giving the orders is exercising a certain limited authority inherent in his or her job responsibilities, and neither party is demeaned or elevated by the exchange.  If management authority implies superior moral worth, and we deny that one person can be worth more than another, then management hierarchies are immoral and must be abolished.  If giving and receiving orders is just a matter of people playing roles that help the business function efficiently, then two people can be utterly equal even though one has the authority to give certain orders to the other, and a hierarchical business structure does not shame or elevate anyone.  It is merely effective or ineffective at serving the needs of the people who serve it, so a deep, shallow, or democratic management structure can be chosen according to which one allows the business to run most effectively.<p>I'm taking it for granted, by the way, that if non-management workers have the power to completely overthrow management, then they also have the power to force management to treat them fairly, and they choose between the two alternatives.  If they somehow had the power to do the former but not the latter, then I suppose they would exercise the power they had.<p><i>Basically, on both counts I'm advocating humility and avoidance of speculation, which are principles that apply to almost all statements by everybody.</i><p>You're right; I know virtually nothing about this, and I am always happy to see someone more knowledgeable than me share what they know.  However, if your contribution to the discussion is to point out my ignorance without attempting to remedy it, cite the existence of learned arguments that you don't care to share, and advocate deferring the point to authority instead of discussing it, then I don't think you're in a position to pass judgment on my contribution.",1356940779

In contrast, the V is one of the worst tiles in the game. It's telling that the Q stays at 10 despite QI -- the Q is by far the worst tile in the game.<p>In any case I've always wondered what the values of tiles should be if we were to use our current word list rather than the NY Times - thanks for this analysis. The blank is missing though, it would probably have a significantly negative value (-25 to -30?).<p>At the end of it all I'd rather keep the values what they are.

You believe (perhaps completely validly) that if someone chooses to work for minimum wage they are hurting themselves and possibly ""all of society"". This is exactly the same argument made by people who don't want people having whatever sexual relations they want in their own bedroom. You will point out that they are wrong and your points are right -- but that's the whole point!</i><p>No. The whole point is what is right and what is wrong.<p>Not if what is right is _consistent_ in situations that is not exactly the same.<p>The only same thing in those two situations presented is that there are ""two adults"" present.<p>In the case of accepting ""minimum wage"" the one agreeing is not even ""consenting"" in the same sense.<p>He is just doing something that he is _forced_ to do by hunger and lack of jobs.<p>Even if one ""needs to have sex"", it's not at all the same kind of ""need"" as needing to eat and feed/shelter your family.<p>The first is an option and a choice. The other is a necessity, and a leverage you can use of people to let them do degrading things.<p>From prostituting themselves to selling their kids.",1356937586

Let's say you are doing 4 billion image requests per hour (the time scale is actually irrelevant): then at a 0.0001% error rate (which is what I get from S3) then 4,000 users per hour are getting an error.<p>C) ... you aren't doing S3 static web hosting if you are keeping access logs, as the only people who know about the request are the user's web browser and the server. You can attempt to detect the error in JavaScript on the client, but you can't keep an access log. If you are logging requests made by your server, then the error rate is irrelevant as you can just retry the operation.",1356937205
