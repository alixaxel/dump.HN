Terrorism, communism, illegal porn and drugs are all used as reasons.<p>Trying to find the reason Biden did what he did is not effective. We may never know the reason. We can look at actions -- what bills were supported, by whom and how far they have gotten in the pipeline. Biden's name or track record might not be relevant. This could have also been someone else.<p>For example the top half of the whole discussion is between chernevik and tptachek whether Biden is in general pro or against encryption. It doesn't really matter what Biden personally believes. But it matters how many and how far and how often such bills make it. Some are passed (like the warrant-less wiretapping), some die quickly.<p>Also there are countries that make use of encryption illegal.  In this country, other laws have passed that chipped away at privacy, so it is understandable why a lot of people feel a little jittery about this topic -- because they can see this kind of bills passing with not too much opposition.",1356932948

If you implicitly do:<p><pre><code>    var self = this;\n</code></pre>\nWhen you need to use `this`, you just end up proxying the problem behind a variable.  If you don't understand what `this` is, it's not going to magically start correcting your misunderstanding.<p>The only possible value it might have is when nesting functions if you refer to `self` instead of `this` correctly, but this is the only case when I actually use this pattern, and when I first create a nested function that needs to use the parent's scope.  Another option is to just `.bind(this)`.<p>In any case, I would disagree that one should try to avoid `this`.  Instead, one should educate themselves to understand what things in the language they're using mean.  And this subject is a great weeder question in Web Engineer position interviews.  If a person can't implement `bind`, can't explain `call`/`apply`, what strict mode does, and what the `this` keyword means in most contexts, they probably aren't strong enough in JS.  This is one of the most fundamental concepts in JS, it shouldn't be a source of confusion.",1356931869

A point where people pay up front, then get the show delivered. And if everything is available everywhere all the time, then there needs to be a tax on life that covers the costs of what they do.<p>Essentially , it's about creating a giant pool of money and a giant pool of media. People can stream, copy, play, or have, whatever they like for free. Corporations, on the other hand, must pay. If you're a store, and advertiser, a movie theater, a school, a business, a church - any entity that exists by virtue of a corporate charter must risk loosing that charter if they don't stream everything they touch through an auditable system that is used to distribute the pool of money according to the levels of interest that different things within it attract.<p>Corporate entities, unlike humans, don't (or shouldn't) have 1st or 4th Amendment rights. We should be able to treat them the same way we treat robots: artificial things designed specifically to serve. And corporate entities also operate in the tangible world, and are in a position to collect money to fill the pool through the course of their activities. Essentially, this is a special tax. If a company wants the benefits of operating in a thriving culture (of which there are many) they can do their part to support it by serving as de-facto box offices.<p>This is a rough idea, I know, and one that raises more questions than it answers.

After the money saving, then no longer wanting to spend money on unnecessary things (but travelling), then moving around, I feel <i>I</i> no longer want to have a car.<p>Mainly for two reasons:<p>- I don't miss being stuck in traffic on the drivers seat, or trying to find parking spots. If I'm on a bus, and there is traffic, I don't mind as much as I can read, or browse the Internet, or game or whatever.<p>- If I don't have a car, I don't need to worry what to do with it if I want to move. No worries about trying to sell it, or wondering if it is worth it to take the car to the new place, what's the traffic legislation on the new place, etc.<p>Yet another part of my PoV is that, even if a car is necessary, I no longer want a new/expensive car. For example, before moving to the city where I currently live, I had to have a car (as there wasn't much of public transportation there).
