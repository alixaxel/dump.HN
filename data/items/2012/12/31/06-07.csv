In the eyes of Americans, there are only two kinds of changes to taxes: cuts and raises. A temporary tax cut is nothing more than a tax cut followed by a tax hike in the view of our wisest statesmen. This gives license to pundits to accuse Obama of raising taxes--because the cuts are not permanent.

To put it this way, from all the entities out there, the government is the more accountable. You think the government serves some big interests (big corporations etc?). It sure does. But a country only at the mercy of private interests, without a mediator like a democratic government, would be intolerable. Actually it would be like what it's in some Banana Republics, where the ""government"" is essentially a front for corporations and private interests.<p>That said, the government (any government) is also the scum of the earth, especially went left to rule without vigilance. Sponsors and big interests come into play and bureaucracy wants to increase its reach and rule as far as it can.<p>And of course government wants to justify itself and its actions, hence the ""official version of history"", in which the nuclear bombs ""ended the war"" (whereas Japan, a nation collapsed and willing to sign a peace treaty was nuked just so that US could showcase the new bombs and send a message to the Reds for the post-war state of things). Or in which ""Pearl Harbor"" was ...""unprovoked"" (whereas the US presidency did all it could before it happened to ensure a war with Japan).<p>Of course the Japanese have their own ""official history"", in which they didn't do anything bad in Manchuria and Korea (where they enslaved, raped, torture, and genocide-like killed thousands of people).",1356936465

You can practice that just fine without a kerb. The rear wheel part of the gentle kerb hop is the tricky bit, I can do it with my eyes closed but describing it is a lot harder. The basic idea is to move your cog forward quickly while at the same time squeezing on the pedals inward. That way you can lift the rear end of the bike onto the kerb. If you flex your knees a bit then you can do this even onto substantial kerb heights.<p>Once you've mastered that hopping down is mostly the reverse to spare the wheel from impacting too hard at the end of the drop.

4988594,comment,4987016,4987016,1,0,rdtsc,,,"> People are supposed to be passive and apathetic and doing what theyre told by the responsible people who are in control.<p>That is the fundamental struggle -- to control the masses. Get them brainwashed, scared, addicted, distracted. One way is to carefully control the information they receive that was very easy up until the Internet showed up. Now it has become a lot harder. China just built up a firewall, here it is a bit more difficult. So it still all has to rely on sophisticated spin and propaganda models.<p>Take Chomsky for example, most people might not even know who he is. They wouldn't have seen (or at least anything positive about) him on TV or mass media. Chances are they read something about him on the Internet or heard from their friends. Sure there were  local activist groups, underground zines, but the cost of spreading information that way was pretty high, now the cost is much lower.<p>As propaganda and media control was becoming more sophisticated it seemed like nothing could stop it,  until the Internet exploded. For example, I haven't went searching for news to any of the popular American news outlets in years. It is funny (or scary) that I trust some silly site like reddit.com to deliver better news than CNN, Fox or other such thing.",1356934670

I believe this is the same rush some runners get. Road bikers tend to go for this sort of high, mountain bikers often get in to the downhill. I am a bit weird in that I prefer uphill to down and usually ride a mountain bike.<p>One thing I would recommend is, once you're out of traffic or are confident of staying on the edge of the road and not being hit by passing traffic, try playing some trance or other high energy music through headphones.  You don't need a special iPod or expensive headphones, just a regular smartphone in your pocket (if like me you remain unconvinced about doing the lycra thing) and in-ear headphones threaded through your shirt will do it.  This isn't just a random recommendation: by adding high energy music, I find that my subconscious regulation of breathing changes and I am able to more accelerate my metabolism both more quickly and to a further point.<p>Source: During my first startup in southwest China I used to leave the office about 4 or 5pm and cycle up a Himalayan mountain at high speed before retiring to social drinking. Through the wonders of cycling I managed to lose a lot of weight and maintain high energy despite heavy drinking :)  Also used to do whole day group or solo rides on the weekends, sometimes both days, usually with more off-road.<p>I've also done (usually month long) cycle tours around southwest China, France, Romania, and Taiwan.<p>A couple of years back, while living in the Hollywood hills of LA for a year, I got a bit in to road biking .. the mountains north of eastern LA are fantastic for weekend rides.  Unfortunately I'm living in Bangkok now, no chance to cycle but a huge private pool to enjoy, and plan to hit southwest China on a regular basis to visit the squirrels in my favoured cycling environment: high altitude Himalayan pine forest.

4988576,comment,4987608,4988429,2,0,eklitzke,,,"FYI, if you had a road bike you were probably using SH-51 cleats, which only release by twisting the rear ankle laterally. There is another model, SH-56, which can be released in multiple directions, including by yanking straight up; it's primarily meant for mountain biking. If you're really concerned about unclipping, these might be better for you.<p>Personally, I haven't had any problems with the SH-51 pedals, including city riding (in San Francisco). Part of it is psychological -- when riding slowly, particularly while splitting lanes, it's a little bit nerve racking to be clipped in at first -- but if you compare to toe clips, you'll probably find that you actually <i>don't</i> step off the pedals very frequently. The other aspect is that it's not completely natural to twist your ankle when falling (since normally you'd roll your ankle doing this!), but after a couple of falls or near-falls you'll get used to it and start to do it without thinking. Every once in a blue moon I'll have to stop extremely suddenly, or start to fall (e.g. misclip in while starting uphill), and I'll now turn my ankles without consciously thinking about it. With clipless you'll find that can actually unclip faster/more easily than toe clips since you can push forwards or sideways with your foot while falling, instead of being restricted to pulling back.",1356934141
