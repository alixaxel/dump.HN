Here's the specs on Titan:<p>18,688 AMD Opteron 6274 16-core CPUs<p>18,688 Nvidia Tesla K20 GPUs<p>17.59 petaflops<p>Titan displaced Sequoia (at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) from the top spot on Top500. Interestingly enough, Sequoia uses a very different architecture, based on 16-core PowerPC A2 nodes rather than GPUs. Sequoia also has about 1.6PB of memory, while Titan ""only"" has 1PB.<p>Both computers have reasonably different use cases. GPUs are great for embarrassingly parallel, non-memory intensive tasks like brute forcing passwords. But all of the rumors about the NSA's massive data analysis needs suggests that they may need a cluster that resembles Sequoia (with fewer cores, but larger caches and available memory) more than Titan.",1355111868

No other language has that, you can not even rely on a recent version of your runtime being available on a given platform. And things get really hairy when you need multiple different versions on the same host.<p>The rubygems+rbenv approach just works really well, almost independently of the platform that you're dealing with.

4897385,comment,4876226,4881728,1,0,hatcravat,,,"Well, you're right: It is 2012, and there are (at the time of writing) all of 6 supercharger stations, which can fill a battery at up to 120 kW.  The current incarnation (heh) of the Tesla S battery limits the rate to about 80 kW for the first 50%, or so.<p>However, there are probably more places to plug in than you'd expect.  For example, there are tons of RV parks all around the country, many of which have NEMA 14-50 sockets for grandma and grandpa to plug their big camper into.  Those sockets can deliver about 10 kW.  Then there are electric clothes dryers, found in many homes: They typically use a 240V, 30A circuit, which can deliver about 5 kW continuously.<p>That last option isn't really practical on the freeway, but how far do you plan to drive to hang out with friends for half an hour?  Let's say you drive a couple hours and stay for the afternoon: Their dryer socket will refill almost half of a Tesla's battery for the grand sum of $5--that'll be enough to get you home (there are practical problems with the approach, but it's not a bad 0th-order approximation).  Are your friends so worried about electricity that they wouldn't accept a 6-pack of their favorite brew in exchange for a power outlet?<p>Electric car owners who frequent online forums report that hotels are very reasonable about charging, and some even install free-to-use chargers as a value-add to attract customers.  In the long term, if electric car adoption increases, hotels will obviously either need to add a surcharge or raise room rates.  But, even if a hotel did sell electricity at a 100% markup, the customer's energy cost for driving a mile on electricity would still be less than half the cost on gasoline.<p>Certainly, electric cars won't work for all trips, and the infrastructure needed to move electrons from the grid to the car is missing in many places.  On the other hand, equipment for 10 kW charging (that's a charge rate of about 30 miles per hour) can be installed almost anywhere in the continental United States for between a few hundred and couple thousand dollars (and in many places it already exists).  For new construction, before landscaping is installed and where a right-size breaker panel can be installed in the first place, the cost of installing 240V, 50A service in the garage is almost inconsequential.",1355111093

(this happened in my area, he finally got charged after the federal government here in Canada blocked the Carter defence) Whether or not the mayor played any role its the whole guilt by association.<p>I personally wonder why Canada ranks so low in comparison to the US and UK when we have moronic ""canada first"" laws in industry that protects monopolies, but then again this is ""perceived"" corruption and the layperson won't be as likely to perceive vastly overpaying for a service as corruption.",1355108626
