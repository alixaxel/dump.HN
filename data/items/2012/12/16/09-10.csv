4927905,comment,4927404,4927786,1,0,ArnoVanLumig,,,"These ""more efficient"" methods are also available without gun regulation, so why doesn't this happen already? Apparently there's something about guns that makes them an attractive weapon for these people.<p>Another thing here is that gun regulation alone is not sufficient. In the Netherlands guns are heavily regulated, but we still had the incident in Alphen a/d Rijn [1] last year. The shooter was a member of a shooting association and <i>was known to have mental problems</i>. That's just not a good combination.<p>If guns could be regulated in such a way that they <i>never</i> end up in the hands of violent lunatics that would probably be okay, but I just don't see how you could do that without banning them altogether.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphen_aan_den_Rijn_shopping_mall_shooting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphen_aan_den_Rijn_shopping_ma...</a>",1355651968

I'm a programmer with a fair amount of experience managing graphic designers, and I have a pretty good eye for design - if I do say so myself ;)<p>After not having personally touched any frontend code for a number of years, I recently found myself in the position of having to personally bootstrap an important side project - backend, frontend, design, and mobile - all on a miniscule budget.<p>The process she outlines so closely mirrored my own that I'm still not entirely convinced she didn't have a hidden camera in my office. This post would have easily saved me weeks of fumbling around, false starts, procrastinating, and looking around for the appropriate resources and frameworks. In my opinion my end product looks much more polished, but she was clearly just putting together a simple demo to support the text, and her design quality is easily sufficient to test out a minimum viable product. Of course, once you get some traction and have a budget to hire a designer, you should because design is sacrosanct blah, blah, blah, etc, etc.<p>But if you're a programmer on your own with no budget, just trying to get your idea out into the world and not embarrass yourself, this could be invaluable.",1355651929

It borders on insanity when we look at the type of weaponry we allow our citizens to purchase, all in the name of an amendment written in a long gone era, where the survival of a fledgling democracy was still uncertain. Just as islamic extremists have hijacked the interpretation of their Koran to serve their purpose, so has the NRA hijacked our constitution to serve its own purpose. And so it's time to come and call out the NRA for exactly what it is - a terrorist organization. \nDespite whatever mental illness may be afflicting these young unfortunate individuals - the answer to preventing what happened in Connecticut from happening again is extremely strong gun control regulation. To the point where even those few who are allowed access cannot keep weapons at home.

But what the system doesn't realize is that this has been hurting so many people from so long and needs to end.<p>The system and its rules aid the trolls in this extortion and the only solution is to unlink our companies from the system that (unknowingly) aids them in this extortion.<p>How do we do it?\nIncorporate offshore in some tax haven, make the local business a cost center that does contract work for the parent. Now the patent troll has to route litigation to unfavorable places without systems to aid them in their extortion and cannot pursue litigation without resorting to costly measures. Once the cycle of easy money is cutoff, and since they are not viable businesses themselves, they will be starved and will die a painful death.<p>But the intention here is also to transfer the pain points from us to elsewhere. With this structure, businesses will start saving taxes through the new route and now the system is the one losing money instead of the small businesses.
