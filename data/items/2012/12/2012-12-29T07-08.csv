4981476,comment,4981469,4981469,1,0,flowersgallary,,,"All of us like to look at those pretty flowers blooming all around, especially during winter and spring. Flowers are not just beautiful to look at, but they also serve a vital role in our ecosystem. Flowers attract insects and birds, which serve as pollinators for the plant itself. All plants produce a flower at some point during the process of their growth. The flower itself produces seeds, which are then pollinated by either being transported by birds or insects, or by being released into the wind or dropped from the plant
 Flower gallary provides detailed information about all flowers that are available in India .we have many flowers like   Himalayan Flowers, Flowering Trees, and Medicinal plants. Remember that tree laden with yellow flowers, which hang like bunches of grapes? How often have you wondered: What's that flower? Nobody around you seems to know the answer. There was a time, when a lot of people knew about a lot of flowers. But for the city bred individual, flowers are only like pretty pictures. The pace of city life tends to alienate the individual from Mother Nature, which brought him into existence in the first place.
Wild flowers are to be found in all kinds of unexpected places if you know how to look for them. While walking in the countryside or climbing a hill in the Himalayas you may come upon some wild flowers brightening a hollow in a rock, or half hidden amidst the ferns which will make the outdoor experience especially rich. Knowing the flowers in ones surroundings furthers a desire to know more about flowers whether near or far, and the need to save all the wild things that we have inherited on the earth. The fact that a rapidly growing population is threatening wild habitats is also connected with an awareness of nature and the need to preserve it.
Flowers gallary is aimed at having information about all the flowers found in India, with their common names, especially in Indian languages, pictures and habitat, easily available in one place. This is meant to be a place you can look at if you saw a flower and wanted to know more about it. Knowing more about flowers, and then going out and having a look at them, will be more like communing with nature .For more details please visit <a href=""http://www.flowersgallary.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flowersgallary.com/</a>",1356767765

What this means to me is that if you are looking for a new work-a-day language (i.e. the language that you use to pay the bills; the ones that appear in the Tiobe top 25), then Scala is probably worth a look.<p>However, if you are happy with your current working language and are, instead, looking for a language that will let you grow as a programmer...well, for that sort of approach I'm not so sure Scala is the best you can do. This is just anecdotal, but I've noticed a trend where someone does something cool in Haskell, and then says ""oh yeah, and with a few adjustments and given a couple of caveats, you can do it in Scala like so..."". In other words, it seems to me that more of the innovation is happening in other languages and then its being brought <i>back</i> into Scala as almost an afterthought.<p>I have seen some hints that this is changing, and so I definitely won't write-off Scala.

This problem was suggested because one of the developers wrote that exact application as a weekend project, and that was exactly how he designed it - schema first.  He noticed that it was both simple and interesting, and therefore was a possible fit for interviews.<p><i>The right answer to all those questions are YAGNI and KISS. :)</i><p>Believe me, I'm aware of that.  Our favorite interviewees had answers with both of those characteristics.  However a major source of real life complications is when YAGNI turns into, ""oops, we did need it"".  And we were actively looking for how people handle that transition, so we asked the questions anyways.<p>Interestingly, the right brand of KISS made that easy.  But that is a different topic...<p><i>But those answers aren't valid so the questions seem to be rigged against the candidate as in ""come up with a schema similar to the one I would have designed - not more complex than that and not more simple"".</i><p>ALL interview questions are ""rigged against the candidate"".  You know them, you know how they work, the candidate hopefully does not.  The goal is not for the candidate to get the ""right"" answer - it is to see them exercise their skills.  This is doubly true of open-ended design questions, which this definitely is.<p><i>I've seen way to many situations in which developers or other persons tried to design a complete schema in which every thinkable and unthinkable instance where covered. Which leads to an incredible amount of work implementing the application that is to use that schema. The more complex the schema, the more complex everything around it has to be which exponentially increases the amount of bugs.</i><p>Absolutely.  One goal of this question was to identify and reject that kind of developer.  I think we did a pretty good job at it.<p><i>Designing applications ""schema first"" is a disastrous technique which will trigger the architecture astronauts in every developer.</i><p>You apparently know only incompetent developers.<p>My experience is the exact opposite.  Competent developers will come up with simple schemas that solve the requested problem in a straightforward way.  Furthermore when you're given a complicated spec for something you're supposed to build, the act of trying to lay out a schema for that spec is an excellent way to smoke out inconsistencies and hidden assumptions about how the application is supposed to work.  Taking these back to the product manager lets you clarify things before you start writing code.<p>Once that is sorted out, you have your data store designed, your front end in the spec, and a pretty reasonable idea how every layer between is likely to work.  Finishing off a basic CRUD application from there is fairly routine.<p><i>With your set of interview questions, you could very well miss a really skilled programmer because he or she understands that keeping stuff simple is hugely more important than not having denormalized data in the database.</i><p>ANY set of interview questions is going to miss some really good programmers.

An old fashioned library will stock most of these titles, and might order the others on request.<p>I'm fortunate enough to live in a city where the library does home delivery (""It's like amazon, but without the money""). Having to physically return the books can be daunting, but it's a small price to pay for eclectic reading habits with no buyer's remorse. I'd recommend that more people look into using the local library. Now that all of my books are free, I have more reading to do than I have time.",1356765415

Facebook started with most data visible only to your friends, and gradually increased the visibility (given default settings) over time. You can track the changes here:<p><a href=""http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mattmckeon.com/facebook-privacy/</a><p>Also, when Facebook launched it was exclusive to Harvard, and then to Ivy League colleges, and then to all colleges, and even for a while after they opened it up it was still mostly young people. Your friends list was a closer match to your peer group. So it's possible that the audience people used to get with a friends-only post a few years ago isn't all that different from the audience you get with a secret group today.

4981402,comment,4976923,4976923,1,0,xivSolutions,,,"I enjoyed the authors article. However, I think he misses the mark with some of his assumptions. Unlike some in this thread, I am NOT trained in economics. But:<p>1) I think the author incorrectly tries to nullify the family budget metaphor for economic prescription. While any metaphor only goes so far, he attempts to compare the micro-economic interactions within the family (""essentially communist"") with the macro-economic revenue/spending/balancing act for a national budget. He misses the point that, in observing that we must ""understand a family as a group of people functioning a single economic agent"" we must consider the requirements of that economic unit to adhere to reasonable financial policies, such as making sure revenues are sufficient to cover debt service and expenses.<p>2) I think the author mis-characterizes the post WWII affluence of the American economy as a result of the wartime government spending combined with some magical wealth redistribution scheme inherent in a wartime economy. In reality, I believe the great American prosperity was more to do with the nation's near monopoly on manufacturing capacity after most of Europe was decimated (and Japan as well).<p>3) I agree with the author that ""trickle-down"": economics (actually more of a political thing than a real economic theory) is inherently flawed. I think he also misapplies the family metaphor here, as well, mixing the micro with the macro.<p>All in all this was an enjoyable and well-written article, and I appreciate the author's ideas about the ""Robot Utopia."" I don;t agree, but what fun is it if we always agree, right?",1356764728
