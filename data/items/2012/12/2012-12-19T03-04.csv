In fact, everyone else solved it the same way as Microsoft before then even on Unix.  Actually, a bunch of Unix guys were involved in the design of UCS-2 and UTF-16 so I'm not sure why it's Microsoft's fault.<p>But yes, some Unix guys eventually faced with a bigger problem, significantly more time, and a design already started by the Unicode Consortium eventually solved it better.  But that's not really much of an argument.<p>Also arguing that there is no risk going to UTF-8 is ridiculous.  Anything that treats UTF-8 as ASCII, as you suggest, is going to do it wrong in some way.  At least making a new API forced developers to think about the issue.",1355889599

4941059,comment,4940434,4940820,3,0,kamaal,,,">>Read - this guy was not only studying something with a very questionable market value<p>One thing that a person must almost remember before doing anything(apart from recreational and entertainment stuff) is to immediately question the 'worth' of what he/she is doing.<p>So it goes like this. A couple of days back my manager spots a architect during lunch and starts talking about how great the architect is. The conversation over the lunch table descends down to my manager just showering praise on the architect about how much the architect knows. It went on for like 20 minutes and then at the end I just asked him- 'So, what is all that worth?', and then there was like dead silence after that.<p>Most of the problems exists because people do not understand how much they know or how intelligent they are is irrelevant to people around them. If you are wondering why the cab driver who drives you back home, or the guy who sells candy in the subway is financially worth more than you. You still haven't figured the mere basic fundamentals of the demand-supply problem. You have to sell/do/provide some product/activity/service which people need. It can be painful for you to know while you can architect a complex system, a intern who just arrived can make more money by selling a simple game on the android market.<p>Add to this class problems. People have a difficult time digesting that a cab drivers kid can go get a engineering degree while a clerk's kid can't. You also have to be ready to do something small time, or things that don't attract respect or jobs that don't command much self respect.<p>And lastly. Please save money, that's important. Theory say you can earn endless money. But if you are from the middle class, face the hard fact now. There is only X amount of money you will ever earn. So learning how to get rid of debts, savings and investments are crucial for your financial well being. If you are in financial mess because you have badly managed money- You can blame nobody else.",1355889322

I cannot tell you how many times I wished I had some super power like telepathy to convey a concept directly into their brains because words just weren't cutting it. The whole idea of taking the locus of control and bringing it inside (love that btw) is what I wanted to teach, and sometimes it gets lost in the ""You could make this happen, why don't you?!"" Your kids have to be confident enough to know that their failures aren't a reflection on their worth, but not so confident that they push the failure outside and into a place where they can deny an ability to change it.<p>Once it 'clicks' the world changes, before it clicks you're adrift in the white water rapids of life. Once you 'get it' you realize you don't have to stop the river you just have to exert the necessary force to navigate around the hazards, before that all you can think is that ""nothing can stop this river, its going to kill me!""<p>I haven't a freakin' clue how to teach that.",1355889296

I think there's a slight lag in what people educate themselves in. For the longest time, only a minority went to college. When few go to college, having a degree at all meant you could get a job, so there was this culture of ""study what you're passionate about, it'll be alright"". This is unfortunately not true anymore, but this is what the older generations are telling us young people, because they haven't realized that things have changed. Today, you have to be able to make a life determining decision right out of high-school, with limited and outdated information and years of the older generations giving you an incorrect view. Soon we'll probably get an over correction with nobody going into humanities and loads of people going into engineering and computer science.<p>What's really needed is mandatory statistics for every degree and school on the form ""1 year after graduation 70% of graduates was able to find jobs, 40% related to their degree, 30% with salaries of $50k+, do you still want to apply?"".

He sold his Toyota and sought opportunities in the Pacific Northwest.<p>He rented a room and set out with his rsum (expertise: fund-raising). But when his $2,000 in savings withered to nothing, ""I ended up sleeping on the street for the first time in my life,"" he said. ""I just kind of had to walk around and try to stay warm.""</i><p>I'm very hesitant to critique someone who is making what he or she perceives as the best choice, especially as a mostly-anonymous commenter on the wild Internet, so I'll frame this as general advice that I think really needs to get out on the general Internet: Do a little research before making a move like this.  Dallas is one of the lowest-cost large cities in the country.  $2,000 would pay for three months of rent and utilities in several areas of the Metroplex.  Denton is cheap, if you like public transit, even to Dallas or Fort Worth, and being in a college town; virtually anywhere in the Mid-Cities is also cheap but lacks transit.  And, as the news will tell you, jobs are booming down there.  Seattle, on the other hand, is one of the most expensive places to live outside of California or New York.  $2k will last a month or two, tops, even down in Rainier Beach or Othello.  Yes, Seattle is a virtual dream land of fairly nice people, decent weather (it doesn't rain _that_ much), and a different brand of politics, but at least someone in this situation can still eat in Dallas.  Young wanderer, if you're ever in this boat and still feel the yearning to move, try Austin.<p>(I moved from Dallas to Seattle with a very good paying job and relocation benefits.  My wallet still hurts every month.  I can't imagine what it would be like for someone in these straits to do the same.)",1355887783
