No business cares about ""improving the quality of human life and alleviating suffering"" (they might pay lip service to that on their brochures though). Shareholders don't care about ""alleviating suffering"", only about return of investment.<p>Umm, not all businesses are in the business of providing happiness to people. Some are in fact in the business of providing misery to people. Anyways, businesses are not the ones deciding what services to provide to the people, customers are. So if you want to blame anybody, blame customers (or as Tool put it: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWMmZEoT84"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PoWMmZEoT84</a>).<p>> And yet, _billions_ of people continue to do that, and _billions_ of people die from deceases that technology has eradicated for us half a century or more ago, and development goes on to other stuff, like --to name but a few-- faster smartphones, game consoles, pet food and bling jewellery.<p>While I can easily sympathize with your position, rich western corporations don't owe jack shit to third world people. I agree that it would be nice of us to help them out. However if we are not interested in helping them out for whatever reason, they still have the option of helping themselves out - the way we helped out ourselves. I sincerely believe that we are not doing it because we want them bad, but we are too preoccupied with solving our own problems to help those guys out. Yes looking at the difference between them and us, does show our preoccupation with self interest. But the reason we solved so many of our issues in precisely our preoccupation with self interest.<p>> (I don't mean ""development"" as in the ""scientific development"" either. I mean it as business development, the idea that production, sales, whatever must continuously expand. I'd be OK with scientific development put directly in the help of humanity, like, say, AIDS drugs sold at cost in Africa instead of pricing them for profit).<p>I believe that you and other people with the same attitude as you should put your money where your mouth is and lead the way for the rest of us.",1356792726

I discovered msgpack almost three years ago and was sad at the lack of javascript support.<p>Since then I've written and maintain a javascript codec with two optimized versions.  One is for [node.js][] and uses node's Buffer methods to do the fast byte to number conversions.  The other is for the [browser][] using typed arrays.<p>I use these libraries in production at various places (the cloud9 IDE backend used them to great effect)<p>While the native JSON.parse and JSON.stringify is slightly faster than mine with string heavy payloads (and the msgpack is only marginally smaller in that case anyway), when the data is array and number heavy, my codec is much faster than JSON and the data on the wire is a lot smaller.<p>Also don't underestimate the value of having a binary data type.  In my libraries, I extended the format slightly to also encode undefined (as well as null).  I also have a string type and a buffer type.  In node.js the buffer type is a instance of a node Buffer.  In the browser, the buffer is an ArrayBuffer instance (typed array type).  So the practical effect is if you put a JS string in, it's encoded as UTF-8 on the wire and comes out the other end as a JS string.  If you put a binary buffer in, it comes out the other end as a buffer.<p>I've contacted the authors of some of the other codecs and when they extend the format, we agree to extend in compatible ways.<p>My biggest production use of msgpack was as the transport format of my [smith][] rpc system.  In smith, an rpc call is done as an array.  The first value is the function to call, and the rest are the args.  If you're calling an anonymous function, then the identifier is a number.  In this usage, the payload tends to be array and number heavy and thus very fast and efficient.<p>(Edited to add in missing links)<p>[node.js]: <a href=""https://github.com/creationix/msgpack-js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/creationix/msgpack-js</a>

Millions of people agreed with his actions, and thousands in upper echelons helped him execute his ideas. From the persecution of the Jews to the invasion to other countries, all of those ideas were quite popular in German thinking and public dialogue for decades before Hitler. It's not as if he was some evil creature emerged from nowhere and fooled everybody.<p>More to the point, nobody calls the leaders of the allies evil, despite they having done equally abominable actions, like killing 250.000 civillians (men, women, elderly, children, babies, kittens et al) with two nuclear bombs, or bombing hundreds of thousands of civillians in Dresden to shreds. But they are not called ""evil"", because they were on ""our"" side, and because they won and so official history (never far away from state sponsoring) accepted their justifications.<p>How about the bloodshed that was the colonial era? European powers killed, enslaved and exploited a BILLION people, in their countries that they invaded and conquerer. Were they ""evil""? That would make every leader of those countries at the time to be equal to Hitler * 10.<p>Not to mention socially established wrong-doing, like people in the South having millions of blacks as slaves, abducted from their villages in Africa.

2) the user doesn't know one or the other of these<p>In the first case, we can give users the ability to permanently delete their accounts by adding a control in the settings panel. We haven't done this yet, simply because it's dangerous, and we want to make sure we get it right (both in implementation and design) so users don't accidentally delete their accounts  or worse, introduce bugs where Inky corrupts our database and deletes or damages some else's account. We'll put this capability in at some point; we just haven't done it yet. (We were not really intending to launch yet; that sort of happened without our expecting it, because we got a bunch of press that we weren't looking for yet  which is good in some ways, but bad for things like this where we frankly aren't quite ready.)<p>The second case is trickier. If the user doesn't know his/her Inky user id or password, we have the security issue of needing to verify the person's identity when they ask us to delete the account. Ultimately we'd like to use two-factor authentication for this, but that costs money (for the associated text messages to/from the user's phone) and involves some implementation work as well.<p>In either case, we could try to manually modify our database and remove the user's account. But we don't have a process around this yet, and my worry is that it could potentially damage the database when someone makes a mistake.<p>What we're telling users now is that if you remove all your email accounts, you leave a shell Inky account that has no sensitive information left in. Our hope is that this is sufficient until we figure out the right long term solutions here. (Note, too, that we can't reset your account password if you forget it, because it's encrypted with your Inky login password, which, by design, we can't get access to.)<p>We know this isn't ideal, and we're going to work on fixing it.
