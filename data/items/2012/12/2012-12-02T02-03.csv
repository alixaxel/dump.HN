Translating it into practical applications has been more of a challenge.

4859904,comment,4858715,4859693,1,0,greggman,,,"So what do you call it when you take a service and don't pay for the service? If you hire a lawyer but don't pay her for her time. If you hire a plumber but don't pay him for his time? A car mechanic? A doctor? A programmer? An artist?<p>I see that a programmer or artist is slightly different because the work the programmer or artist did can be duplicated where as the lawyer, plumber, doctor, car mechanic's work can not but they're still effectively the same. Someone worked and expects to be compensated for that work. Not compensating someone for work you received I believe is also called ""theft"".<p>I'll also note that the most pirated software often represents a lot more work than a single lawyer, plumber, doctor, car mechanic. If you use one of their services you'll likely get a few hours of their time. If you pirate photoshop or MW3 that likely represents a few hundred man years of time.<p>Anyway, I'm not arguing against piracy. I'm not sure what other word their is though for taking someone's time/labor without paying them.",1354417014

In fact, only assembly language for some CPUs was as simple as basic (now, it's not really the case anymore, although asm basics are simple, stuff often gets complicated with special registers and special opcodes doing magic)<p>Many languages today as simple and relatively sane, like, say ""python"" ;-)

4859901,comment,4855911,4859377,1,0,beagle3,,,"I feel sorry for you, really.<p>I figured out that wheat is bad for me. As in, I've stopped taking in wheat (much harder than it sounds, because it's used as a filler in just about everything), upped my overall caloric intake (mostly coconut fat and butter), and lost 30 pounds in a month feeling much much better. As in, better than in years. That happened 24 months ago, and it stayed off.<p>My doctor, seeing it, said it was impossible - because every test HE had at his disposal said I did not have a wheat allergy (or intolerance, or whatever other variations of ""bad for you"" medicine has).<p>If you claim that losing 30 pounds in one month and it staying off for two years since is placebo, I'm going to laugh at you, and so will everyone else who actually has a brain and is not religiously following some mantras.<p>A friend of mine is allergic to peppers of any kind. Not deathly allergic, but excruciating-pain allergic. 20 years ago or so, it was not a standard diagnosis, and some doctors therefore suggested it was psychosomatic (because apparently, that was the only ""scientific"" explanation). Whatever it is she has, has since become a standard diagnosis (she's missing an enzyme, and it is a recessive genetic trait). Are you seriously claiming that she should have eaten peppers all these years because her self diagnosis was ""not scientific""? I would give you the benefit of doubt that you do not, although your response indicates otherwise.<p>The ""science"" you talk about is a religion, and if you refrain from self experimenting because ""it is not science"", then you are a religious zealot. Physics is science; Chemistry is science; Nutrition and Medicine are religions that are controlled by politics and money, that are informed by science, but are definitely not following it.<p>Yes, science is a great thing. It's hardly related to modern nutrition, and missing from some areas of modern medicine.<p>Doctors and nutritionists have been claiming for years that salt is bad for you, and dietary cholesterol is too (to the point that you should limit e.g. eggs to no more than two a week). If you can find scientific evidence anywhere that, say, 25 eggs/day, is not healthy, then please show it. Because no one I know is aware of any. Or any evidence for calorie balance (carb=4kcal/g, fiber=0kcal/g, ...) theory for that matter. Add nutrition experts and ""MDs"" to your list of homeopaths and other pseudoscience peddlers - they're only better on the average because their pool of (mandated!) beliefs is culled more often -- but definitely not often enough to give it the halo of science that you assume it has.",1354416891

Multitasking is considered bad because people switch contexts and lose bits of information in the process. Some people can retain their context longer, or have a workflow in which they can easily rebuild their context based on hints (notes, to-do lists, mental mind-map).<p>In my case, whenever I'm working on some complicated bit of code and someone interrupts me to ask a question, or to go to their desk, I have no problem doing it because I am already immersed in the task and don't need to offload it anywhere. If I realize that the talk is going to take longer than I though, or if it is about something completely different from what I'm working on, then I might scribble myself a quick note to get my mind back in the state that I need to be in.<p>Or another example: assisting two different people with two different programming problems via chat, while myself working on a third one, but all in the same codebase. There's not a lot of context switching required because we're all sharing the same code and are all in the same mindset. My productivity in terms of my own code does decrease using this method, but it's still more productive than taking the time to go and sit with each individual person to go through their problems one by one.<p>tl;dr: multitasking is impractical in some situations, but there are situations where you can benefit from it.

I recognize the Enterprise, and more generally the U.S. carrier fleet, played a significant role in the relative peace we've had in the world since WWII.<p>Sure, there have been wars since then.  But the total loss of lives, and total destruction from those wars, has been relatively minor in comparison to wars of the past.  Nations only go to war, and only continue fighting, as long as they think they can gain from it somehow -- land, resources, safety, ideological spread, whatever.  Having a carrier group parked off your coast ready to unleash fury tends to cut into those possible gains, and therefore deters nations from entering into hostilities.  The value proposition of ""negotiating"" becomes higher than that of ""fighting"" in a lot of marginal cases.  Strategic weapons (like carriers and nukes) in essence win wars by causing them not to be fought.<p>From where I stand, that's a win -- not just for ""my side"", but for humanity as a whole.",1354414435

I shouldn't have said anything.<p>That said, if you're struggling to find differences between Obama's administration and Bush's, you're looking in the wrong places.<p>I assume when you mention ""the right to assassinate American citizens,"" you're referring to the case of the Yemeni boy who was killed by the drone? If that's the case, trust me when I say I don't disagree with you here: it's a horrible thing. BUT, just because it's horrible doesn't mean it wasn't avoidable. The boy knew that his father was on the ""kill list"" as a known extremist. In choosing to go and visit him in Yemen anyway, he would have accepted the possibility that he would be put in harms way by association. It was an avoidable risk that he knowingly chose to take. I don't find that nearly as offensive as say, Guantanamo bay, which I might add was created by the Bush administration.<p>But international politics is a messy area, and I think it's safe to say that no matter who is president, horrible things are bound to happen as a result of global economic climate, and independent of who's in office. What REALLY offends me, though, are the things that happen here at home.<p>When I hear conservatives say things like ""We don't need more trees! We need more jobs!"" I'm immediately offended that someone so short-sighted could even consider running for office. When important officials are making claims about women's bodies rejecting fetuses that are the result of rape, and others are refusing to teach the theory of evolution, I'm offended. These ideas are not healthy: they're toxic. They hinder the advancement of society.<p>So frankly, if I had to pick one thing about the Obama Administration that I do ""care to discuss,"" it's gotta be the fact that never have I ever heard him suggest any such toxic ideas.

So yes, it's bad news for that lie to be exposed for those perpetuating the lie I guess.<p>> For example, by knowing discrete and apparently unconnected facts about you  your shirt color, gait, driving habits and the e-mail font you use  companies could, using algorithms that sort the profiles of hundreds of thousands of people like you, accurately predict what kind of porn you surf.<p>Say what now?
