4924600,comment,4923914,4924259,2,0,Alex3917,,,"I think age of spiritual machines is actually the perfect title. The whole idea of the singularity is that you can't predict the nature of emergent phenomena based on lower level inputs, specifically with regards to the future of technology. This is basically analogous to the fact that we can't predict consciousness or intelligence by looking at the properties of matter or even biology.<p>I also don't see anything religious about the concept. Religion by (etymological) definition seeks to understand or connect with ultimate source of things, whereas the singularity is A) about the future and B) says that the future is going to be impossible to predict or understand because of accelerating change. At best you might be able to argue that it's vaguely teleological, but I'm not even sure that that is correct because the theory doesn't make any real predictions for what happens in the longterm after the singularity.",1355546160

And the downside of extra abstraction quickly outweighs any superficial perception of familiarity.<p>If you create a new language, you have to strike a good balance between language features and interoperability.

4924586,comment,4920542,4923413,1,0,rayiner,,,"> No it isn't. If we know who's pushing for this we can possibly persuade them to stop. Politicians aren't going to stop if someone is donating to their campaigns and there isn't a massive public outcry, but a special interest pushing for this might be easier to reach (or, if they can't be reached, they can be exposed, increasing the chance of the kind of public outrage that politicians might actually react to)<p>This is an oft-repeated but utterly wrong characterization of the political process. It fits a compelling narrative for some people, but it has no basis in reality.<p>Here is the basic truth: it takes neither public outcry or big donations to get politicians to do something like this. Wal-Mart, Lockheed, etc, don't need to grease any palms to get a Congressperson to jump at their command. No, all they have to do is use some magic words: ""jobs,"" ""terrorists,"" etc. Politicians are a deeply paranoid bunch. They are paranoid of being labeled ""soft on crime"" or ""soft on terrorism"" or ""bad for jobs."" And they are deeply paranoid about these things because they are trigger words for the public.<p>A good example of this is how Obama fell over himself to compete with Romney about who could be more pro-coal. Why did Obama swing so hard on that issue? Not for fear of losing donations. The ""clean coal"" lobby gave $240k to Obama's campaign. That's nothing in a campaign that raised over $1 billion. No, he did it because ""anti-coal"" is a buzzword, not just for people in coal mining states, but for blue-collar Democrats who equate ""anti-coal"" with ""anti-industrial jobs"" and the more liberal elements of the party.<p>The same thing is true of terrorism. There is not a huge public outcry saying ""make us safer"" but there doesn't need to be. Nobody wants to be painted as ""pro terrorist"" and the fear of terrorism is still a great way to get a project through the DOD or NSA.",1355545280

When someone says they are an expert in Java, they do not mean that they are well-versed in what sort of Java statements have unexpected, undefined, or indeterminate behavior.  Even more so when someone calls themselves an expert in Lisp, Haskell, Scala, and other high-level languages.  We are not talking about maintainability or style, we are talking about just being able to solve basic computational problems without having your program abort.  In addition to this entire book on what not to do, books on advanced C++ programming (like the ""Effective C++"" series) are loaded with things you shouldn't do:<p><a href=""http://www.semantics.org/cpp_gotchas/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.semantics.org/cpp_gotchas/index.html</a><p>C++ also encourages programmers to do ""bad things,"" where other languages discourage such code.  In Scheme, arguments to functions are evaluated in an undefined order, and so such arguments should never have global side effects; but Scheme discourages global side effects in general.  In C++, arguments to functions are also evaluated in an undefined order...but global side effects are encouraged and widely used in C++, and it is easy to inadvertently create a situation where this becomes a problem (e.g. one argument might resize a vector, when the other is an iterator to that vector -- both common, both encouraged, but a pretty bad combination).  C++ makes the most dangerous ways to do things the easiest and least verbose:  pointers to access arrays, fixed-width integers, floating point numbers, etc.; other languages make such dangerous things more verbose and force programmers to be explicit when they try to utilize such constructs.",1355544120

I thought I'd be able to find something specifically about humans faking social signals in exactly this context, but I didn't. Also, ""social signalling"" is full of results about trying to teach computers how to deal with human social signals, and how to process data from social networks (not quite the same thing). It's a busier term that I thought it would be.<p>(Dramaturgy is a word I'd never encountered before, either, though I've noticed the concept in play in people around me. Not mentioned in the Wikipedia page that I could see, but something you can probably see once you are looking, is that some people act as if they are in a play constantly, but are playing to the wrong audience. I have a relative who acts as if the entire world is a soppy mid-day women's talk show and constantly play up their concern to an audience who is actually pretty OK with, say, a 12-year old riding a bike without having to express concern every time that they are going to hurt themselves. And there's always some people who never seem to leave High School, or at least take a few decades longer than it should to realize that they're not on that stage anymore.)",1355544107
