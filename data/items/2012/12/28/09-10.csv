To Americans (colloquially meaning U.S. citizens here), I think the phenomenon can be attributed mainly to two causes.  The first is that Americans don't travel much, only a small minority hold passports.  And who can travel with a meagre two contiguous weeks of holiday per year, and with real incomes of the 99% declining for the past 30 years?  The second is that the political propaganda machine in the States explicitly lumps all the nations of Europe into the ""un-American, thus wrong-thinking"" category.  You need look no further than our last presidential election for evidence of this: <a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16583813"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16583813</a> .  There's probably a third force at work that just occurred to me: I think that in American schools, kids are not taught anything meaningful about Europe other than perhaps a vague bit about the World Wars. Namely who was ""good"", and who was ""evil"", black & white just like modern American politics.  My apartment here in Berlin has a Berlin-raised caretaker who I've had a few extended conversations with.  I'm astounded by how much he knows about American history, to the point of even forming opinions (historical ones, not politico-propaganda-influenced ones as far as I can tell) on individual events such as the battle of Little Bighorn. He's in his late 40s, speaks English fluently, and knows more about American history than most Americans I've met. I'm not sure that I entirely know what to make of this, but it certainly leaves me with the impression that there's an element of learning and sheer curiosity about the world that's largely absent in the States.",1356686982

There's no ""render"" function, no jQuery DOM manipulation for common tasks, because all rendering behavior is declared in the HTML. Unless you're doing something non-trivial, in which case you should write a custom directive. (For those unfamiliar with Angular, a directive is a declaration of a new HTML tag or attribute with custom behavior which can be reused throughout your app)<p>I've got to admit that I've never worked on a substantial Backbone app, but many of the issues I see people having with Backbone (regarding rendering item and list views, programmatically binding events, etc..) are simply non-existent in Angular.",1356686939

I have a single-page playlist app for YouTube and SoundCloud called Muxamp [1] that runs on Node.js. The site is served as static HTML/JS/CSS right now, using JavaScript for all the heavy lifting. All requests go to a REST API--JSON in, JSON out. When a playlist is requested (static data), the server checks a cache, then checks the DB. Data is turned into JSON and sent over the wire.<p>I'm currently doing a rewrite in Backbone, which is extremely amenable to this kind of design. Unit testing so far has been pretty painless, too. Creating a new server instance is as easy as calling a function to get a server object with the endpoints specified. Start the server in setup, close it in teardown. Node.js makes this stuff super easy to automate, provided you can learn to live with callbacks and promises.<p>[1] Example playlist: <a href=""http://muxamp.com/1776"" rel=""nofollow"">http://muxamp.com/1776</a>",1356685519
