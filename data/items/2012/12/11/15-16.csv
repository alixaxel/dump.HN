You might say--people shouldn't be able to buy land by the beach--that belongs to the public (and that is the law in some places). But once you have a valid property right, it's not illegitimate to sue for real infringements of that property right, and it's not illegitimate to split up the ""bundle of sticks"" that makes up your property right and sell someone nothing more than the right to sue for infringements and keep any damages.

Most shipments aren't paid for at the counter. You get a weekly bill. If you ship more than a few packages a week, it's very difficult to tell which surcharge is attached to which shipment. All they give you is a tracking number and unless you spend all day memorizing their tracking numbers, you won't know which end is up.<p>Also, are you going to spend 15 minutes on the phone every time you get dinged for two bucks unfairly?

This would include (and probably be limited to) Y Combinator, TechStars, and DreamIt ventures (unless you're looking at a specific startup niche).  The application process will filter out people who aren't serious.  The downside is that they might not be willing to give up as much equity if there already is a decently large team.<p>Grad programs at the top CS / Engineering schools (Stanford, CMU, MIT, Berkeley, U of Illinois) are also filled with people who are looking to start companies, and most have mailing lists / message boards for opportiunities.<p>There is a real talent in business, but it seems to be more of a personality disposition as opposed to a tangible skillset.  At least for undergraduate programs, business tends to be less rigorous than their technical equivalents.  Most of the ""build my crappy idea"" people are purely non-technical, because they have less insight into what is feasible, and because by their nature they are completely reliant on others to build it.  My disposition is to go for somebody who is technical, is socially ""with it"", and has the drive to hustle and learn whatever else they need to know.<p>By the way, I graduated CS from CMU undergrad a couple of years ago, and I'm working on a startup of my own.  The startup is called Pensieve, and it is a publishing platform for interactive courses.

Insurance works because the risk of X happening to individuals in a group of insured people is low individually, even if over the entire population it isn't.  This ensures the number of actual payouts are low.    Here, the risk of troll lawsuits happening to all insured companies is high.  Thus, you'd have to pay out to almost everyone.<p>2. Insurance also only works (for the insurer, anyway) if the premiums cover the payouts.  Given the typical award is tens of millions or hundreds of millions, you'd need both lots of companies, and very high premiums.<p>To cover a single $100 million award, you'd need 10k companies to pay 10k each in premiums.  If 100 million gets awarded against each of 5 companies in the lawsuit, now it's 50k premium per 10k companies.<p>ISTM it quickly becomes infeasible as long as damages are so high.<p>Note: General types of lawsuit insurance are already available, but they exclude patent infringement.

4904876,comment,4904567,4904567,2,0,rayiner,,,"This article defines ""troll"" far too broadly, in including any non-practicing entity. The whole point of turning something into a property right is to be able to trade it, and have the new owners enforce the original rights. It's conceptually no different than someone who buys a farm, doesn't plant anything on it, but sues people who trespass through it. The law doesn't require you to do anything with your property rights.<p>There are practical reasons for this. My law school alma mater, Northwestern, developed and patented the drug that became Lyrica. They sold the patent rights for about $700 million. Northwestern was not going into the prescription drug business. That would be utterly ridiculous. Treating patents as a property right allowed them to take the invention and ""exit"" by selling it to someone else. All research universities use this technique heavily: Stanford, MIT, etc.<p>Now, you may not agree that propertization is the right tool for inventions, but the fact remains that when you're discussing a property right it's irrelevant what someone trying to enforce that property right otherwise does with the property.<p>IMO, ""trolling"" should be limited to those who assert frivolous or weak patents to get quick settlements, not people who try to enforce legitimate patents. This is completely orthogonal to what sort of bar you think there should be for legitimate patents, or whether there should even be patents, by the way.",1355239960

Where are you getting the idea about perl being a web server?<p>> And Perl had no frameworks to help write web apps so we wrote a lot of boiler plate crap every time just to get started.<p>If we are talking about earlier times(say 1996), ""perl had no frameworks"" compared to what? Web related libraries and frameworks were in their infancy at that time for all languages, and perl wasn't a special case. If anything, perl had more vibrant ecosystem owing to CPAN and people actually using it for web programming.<p>> Java also had threading really well integrated from the start so we could handle many requests at once which was starting to become a problem by 2005 or so<p>Threads, non blocking io, processes with copy on write predate Java.<p>> .NET was really just another Java for Windows. Nothing is fundamentally awesome about it over Java except that the engineers got to learn from Java’s mistakes.<p>And learning from mistakes and not making those mistakes doesn't make it better? Current C# is a much cleaner language.<p>> The difference between the old days of Perl and today is that we’ve made the real web server in C++.<p>Apache was released in 1995. And what is this <i>real</i> web server you talk about?<p>> That’s why Ruby and its surrogate languages will eventually disappear<p>No, they won't.
