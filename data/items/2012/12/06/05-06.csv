That particular set of actions is coming back to hurt us.<p>Now if we could get the Congress to pass a law that says the US registrars cannot take down a domain of an offshore company unless there is a judicial order to do so, <i>from the host country</i> that would go a long way to making amends.

While I might be more inclined to dismiss this, the Kindle Fire is only on its second iteration of devices. While the argument could be made for supporting several versions back, only the second generation back.<p>Subsequently, with the number of sales the first generation has allegedly received, it seems like a much larger issue if the app were to gain any popularity or be promoted on Amazon's storefront. Amazon has valid concerns and is just attempting to guarantee at least function on a very limited number of devices. It's hard to find fault with that.",1354773509

4880472,comment,4879433,4880322,1,0,snowwrestler,,,"Sorry, I misspoke above. Rather than edit I'll just correct myself here.<p>What I should have said is:\nThe expected future profits of Amazon would have to be 283x their own current profit (sorry, not Apple's profit), to arrive at a P/E similar to Apple's now. (In other words, to match Apple's strategy of extracting max profits to cash.)<p>That is a smaller number than I implied above, but it would still require Amazon at some point in the future to make a profit of $178 billion in 2012 dollars--more than 4x Apple's current profits.<p>To achieve that with, for example, the profit margin of Walmart (the current dominant retailer), they would need to do about $5 trillion in sales, again in 2012 dollars--about one third of U.S. GDP, or 1/14 of world GDP.<p>If we spot them Apple's current profit margin, sales would still need to be about $670 billion--about $180 billion over Walmart's current sales (at much higher product prices).<p>So while I totally understand the idea that Amazon is reinvesting for future growth, I just don't think future growth could ever be high enough to justify the stock price now.",1354773163

For straight-up linear regression, with a heavy emphasis on observational data appropriate for microeconometrics, ""Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach"" by Jeff Wooldridge is absolutely phenomenal (an old edition is fine).  (This is usually assigned for advanced undergraduate econ majors or non-advanced masters students; I don't know what the equivalent would be for undergraduate stats majors).<p>For more ""intuition about working with data, especially if you're a visual person,"" Howard Wainer's books are wonderful; one example is ""Graphic Discovery: A Trout in the Milk and Other Visual Adventures.""  They're non-technical, short chapters, discussions of different data sets.<p>Bill Cleveland's ""Visualizing Data"" and ""Elements of Graphing Data"" cover the same material -- graphing data -- at a more technical level.  I don't know Cleveland's books would help with the issues you asked about, but... they are amazing books and if you're interested in the subject at all I can't recommend them highly enough.<p>I don't have any free recommendations, unfortunately.",1354773058

In this case, the aim of the cited report is to advance EPI's conclusion: ""Now is not the time to increase the number of H-1B visas and STEM green cards"".<p>EPI concerns themselves with the very broad category ""computer and mathematical occupations, workers with at least a bachelor’s degree"".

Sometimes expanded demand, if filled with more marginally-qualified workers, brings down average wages, because workers are not uniform interchangeable cogs.

Spying on everyone out of paranoia over terrorism.<p>2. Doing whatever the RIAA and MPAA's lobbyists want them to do.<p>That's not so good, but the ITU's express goal seems to be to balkanize the internet into a collection of state-controlled networks.  One of the biggest benefits of the internet is that it shrinks the world and grants everyone, regardless of what country they live in, access to the same online community.  I probably sound like complete hippie saying this, but I believe the global community created by the internet really is bringing all peoples of the world closer together.  Reversing this trend would be far worse than anything ICANN is likely to do in the next decade!<p>Of course, as bad as the ITU's intentions are, the reality would likely be even worse. The internet is so interconnected that the power one state is granted over the internet in its own jurisdiction would likely translate into power they wield over everyone.<p>ICANN is, by far, the lesser of two evils at present.
