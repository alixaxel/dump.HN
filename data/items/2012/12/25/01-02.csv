Everyone seems to have forgotten that Steve Jobs actually went on stage and declared that Web Apps were the way you would develop apps for the iPhone, in 100% JavaScript. This was almost a year before the App Store and the Cocoa Touch SDK. Nobody really believed him at the time, but it was in line with what they'd been doing.<p>If you look at Safari's evolution on the desktop, there was a ridiculous performance boost with Safari 3. Incidentally, this was during the same time they would've been developing the iPhone's browser. At the same time they started doing things like CSS animations, CSS transitions, CSS 3D (which was first available on iOS, not on the desktop), all technologies that are required to bring an Apple/Cocoa-like experience to web apps. That's not a coincidence.<p>Someone who worked at Apple told me that, in fact, Steve Jobs wasn't entirely lying. They did believe web apps were the future.

Pretty interesting.<p>Point 2) I tend to be the nail sticking up, but that is more a function of my job descriptions in the past where it was my responsibility to say ""no"" or question things. It takes a a certain amount of deftness to pull it off consistently combined with a fearlessness of not getting your head chopped off.<p>The results of the test I recently took said something on the order that I am a very blunt person that appreciates honesty. While this is true in many cases, the test dismissed the idea that I have situational awareness. There is a time for letting someone know that they could have done better and there is a time for congratulating people for doing their best, even if my expectations were disappointed. Empathy didn't seem to be an important measurement for this particular version of the test. People are complex and slippery, with their own motives, and sometimes you can't expect people to be what they aren't.<p>To say the least, it was upsetting to read a small part of my personality painted with such a thin brush. Ultimately, if I was a hiring manager and read such a description, I would probably think twice about speaking to this person again. This seems to suggest that whoever created the test, or whoever wrote the descriptions, had axes to grind vs certain personality ""traits.""",1356399871

I think that the business model of grow first then make money will still be vastly more popular than it has a right to be over the next few years and likely beyond. Though hopefully some of the sheen has been taken off of it.<p>The problem is that sometimes the strategy works, and sometimes when it pays off it pays off big. Amazon being the best example. And there will likely always be a continuous string of the strategy working, in a big way, for the foreseeable future. And that will create a much larger group of gamblers who think they can bet on the same strategy even when the business fundamentals show they have almost no chance of pulling it off.<p>Facebook is a weird example in this case because in some regards their business model was justified. They managed to create a multi-billion dollar, worldwide business in a short span. There's every reason to believe that they can sustain billion dollar per year profits for many years. However, they managed to sell their IPO on the premise of being a company that's almost 100x bigger than they are now, which is a bit of a ridiculous idea. Even if they gobbled up most of the worldwide ad budget it wouldn't justify their IPO valuation. Yet enough suckers bought into the idea that the company made a lot of money from the IPO and the stock price has even managed to rebound from its low this year, although to be honest I don't think that reflects a rational evaluation of the company.<p>As far as businesses targeting customers directly, I think that continues to be a big thing and is if anything only growing in popularity. For every instagram or facebook which tries to court hundreds of millions of users with free services there are a huge number of smaller companies who are selling services directly to customers at a profit.

All automatic (which include burst fire) weapons count as machine guns under the National Firearms Act, and are highly regulated. No machinegun made and registered after 1986 can be legally transferred between civilians. Amongst other difficulties and regulation, that restriction means automatic weapons typically sell for enormous amounts.<p>The term you're looking for is 'assault weapon' which is a generally poorly defined term. Under the terms of the previous federal assault weapon ban, an assault weapon (rifle) is any weapon that has in addition to detachable magazines (a ""clip"" in popular culture), has at least two of the following features: a folding or telescoping stock, pistol grip, bayonet mount, flash suppressor, and/or muzzle mounted grenade launcher, as well as AR-15s, TEC-9s, Uzis, and AK-47s - those models being specifically named and banned.<p>Since we are looking at New York specifically, then the following apply. Rifles and shotguns (""long guns"") do not require a state permit for purchase, nor registration, nor a license. Handguns require all three. There are additional restrictions on handguns that will typically limit their licensees to using and carrying them for sport.

And it wasn't a case of the atom merely being iterated in design until it matched ARM efficiency levels, that's not what's happened. Instead, the Atom was originally just a low-power stand-alone processor and now Intel has developed a first generation Atom based system-on-a-chip. The fact that Intel's first SoC designs are so closely competitive to ARM's n-th generation designs should send alarm bells ringing throughout the ARM industry. Intel is good at improving design and they are even better at economies of scale.<p>It's easy to dismiss Intel's offerings as not being competitive with state-of-the-art ARM designs, but only a sucker would dismiss Intel and rest on their laurels. Intel's 2nd and 3rd generation chips are just going to be that much better, and ARM could be in serious trouble in as little as a year or two from now.
