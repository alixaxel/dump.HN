We have stayed at the Luna Blue almost every year since Tony and Cheri have opened. \nIn late 2011 I was checking on availability of the Luna Blue for our vacation. I was surprized to find expedia said they had no room available. \nI then checked a couple other small hotels in Playa and was told they were also full. I then contacted Cheri and found that they did have plenty of rooms. Which we did book thru the hotel.<p><i>Deanna said - December 5, 2012 at 11:03 am</i><p>I know first hand about this. I had booked a room back in Feb. to travel in November. I got an email mid Oct. from Hotels.com that Luna Blue no longer had any openings for that time. It didnt make sense to me. \nAfter calling Hotels.com and them wanting me to book elsewhere I got hold of Cheri. She was in San Francisco at the time but took the time out to make sure I was able to rebook through their website directly for the time I had originally booked. \nI was also able to save 10% off what I had originally expected to pay. We went and stayed at Luna Blue and it was truly a wonderful experience. Cheri was out of town when we came so I was not able to meet her but Tony made us feel welcome and we wish you guys all the luck fighting this horrible thing that has happened. \n  I would certainly stay here again if I return to Playa.",1356443890
