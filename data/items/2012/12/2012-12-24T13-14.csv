But monopolies in and of themselves are not a problem - it's the abuse of monopoly powers which is the problem.<p>""Abuse"" is almost by definition a question of morality, not of economics. It may be better for the economy (more prosperous, shorter recessions, or some other measure) should we once again allow child labor. Indeed, I've heard more than one person argue that a reason for banning child labor was to raise wages for adults by introducing a shortage of workers. But the bans stay because of moral reasons, and we export our morality to other countries when we demand that our clothes and other items not be made with child labor. Even if the economics of that country would be better with more local child labor.<p>The morality comes into play here because part of the reason people work for a company is to reduce personal economic risk. As a consultant, my income is highly variable, and it's stressful when that income is low. Even when my income is high, I can't make the same economic decisions as someone who is salaried and with the same monthly salary as my average, because of the Gambler's Ruin issue I mentioned. There can be and have been times when my savings became quite low, and I was seriously considering getting a salaried job. While now, my income is quite above my average.<p>A salaried job is an exchange of services for money. The general expectations are given in the contract, the law, and the general culture. One of the employee expectations is that the salary will generally be stable, and it will be more stable for government jobs than at a company. People will go into civil service for that increased (perceived) stability, even though it doesn't pay as well.<p>But unlike, say, overtime pay, this stability is not usually part of the contract nor (in the US) the law. A company can unilaterally decide to cut wages and/or benefits on employees. I've shown examples where that has happened this year. The abuse comes in when companies start breaking both the explicit and implicit promises which are part of the employer/employee relationship. If pay cuts becomes more frequent, then there will be increasing outrage, and the implied stability will be made explicit in either the law, or the contract, ... or people will accept that they have no control over their month-to-month wages. I think the latter is bad for us as a culture.<p>You and the economists may be perfectly correct in saying that ""stickiness of wages causes greater unemployment."" What action should be taken from that observation? Should there be laws which prevent stability clauses in a contract, in order to reduce unemployment levels? Or should there be a basic stipend so people can be unemployed for longer while they search for a job with higher stability levels?<p>This thread started in part because of an observation that in many places in the US there is a broadband duopoly with AT&T and Comcast. In and of itself, this is okay, so long as they don't abuse those power. The recent ""Data Caps Help Carriers Rake In Huge Profits"" (e.g., <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/19/report-data-caps-help-carriers-rake-in-huge-profits/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/12/19/report-data-caps-help-carri...</a> ) gives an example of what I would call an abuse of that duopoly power.<p>I've carefully said ""broadband duopoly."" There are other ways to get access to the internet, including some 3 million people who use dial-up for AOL. Monopoly law is careful about defining a market before looking to see if there is an abuse of monopoly powers.<p>I assert also that employment should also be subject to a similar market segmentation analysis. If there's only one factory in town, paying $45/hour, and the other jobs are retail and fast-food paying $10/hour, then those are different employment markets. Yes, someone could quit the factory and start working at the DQ, but someone could also quit with AT&T and switch to AOL dial-up. The local factory has a monopoly on high-paying jobs for the area, and can (and does!) use that market advantage.<p>My thesis is that the same analysis used to identify monopoly abuse in the market should also be used to identify monopoly abuse in employment relationships. No, employers aren't necessarily monopolies, nor do they necessarily abuse their monopoly if they have one. But I think the parallels between monopoly abuse and unilateral change of employment conditions are close enough that the former has bearing on the latter.",1356357508

4962829,comment,4961357,4961964,2,0,bstpierre,,,"It sounds like we've had similar experiences. I converted a handful of ad hoc ""state machines"" in a telephony system to FA. The original code was loaded with exceptions and special cases (and bugs). Converting to FA required detailed analysis of the existing system to extract the distinct events and states. I used a tool I wrote [1] to generate C state tables and an event loop from a description of the states+events.<p>While the state machines that came out of the analysis were a big improvement, they still weren't perfect. We came across a few bugs later on. Using a strict representation of the state machines was a huge advantage in debugging and maintenance. When everything is moving through the same event loop, it's easy to add logging in the form ""[timestamp] state A: event X -> state B"". Adding a new state or event to the machine (to fix a bug or add a new feature) is much easier when everything is in one place.<p>In a couple of cases, the state machine started to become large and unwieldy. Usually the cause was that there would be a couple of ""meta"" states: we'd have states A, B, and C, but then we'd need to represent ""states B and C when X is true; states A and B when Y is true"". Pulling X and Y into a separate machine simplified the parent state machine -- every X and Y moved into the child divides the number of states in the parent by as much as half. Then the parent can inject events into the child, and the child can fire events back to the parent.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bstpierre.org/Projects/smc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bstpierre.org/Projects/smc/</a>",1356357401

Once they felt the pain from their tests, they just stopped writing tests.  What else are they going to do... challenge the ""Rails Way?""<p>And this is the community that is supposedly known for their testing.

It works very well for the most part, but we're definitely still figuring out the best way to split things up.<p>For example, say we want to work with a 'user' model, and we need to do basic CRUD stuff. One argument would say that we should have a module for each action: creating users (registering, hashing password, sending out welcome email, etc.), deleting users (cleaning up their data, removing them from the db), and for authentication, profile updates, and so on. The downside to this is that we end up with a dependence on the underlying data structure across lots of modules. If we want to change the property 'username' to 'login', or something more complex, we have a lot of modules to change. We also need to understand how a user is created before we can understand how they are updated or deleted, which means we need to have the CreateUser module in our head while we're working on UpdateUser or DeleteUser.<p>Perhaps this problem is worse in our set up because we have only very thin 'models', which are basically just Mongoose wrappers around MongoDB, and so our UpdateUser models is still quite heavily coupled to our database.<p>All things considered, I've found the schema described in this article is better than any alternatives that we've tried. Perhaps we're just floating at the equilibrium point where either more or less abstraction would make the code more complicated.

But it does not take 5.25 million dollars to prove that Cherry would not work. Just a couple of thousands to test at a local market. In fact, most startups these days don't need millions of dollars to prove their business model. They just need thousands, not millions. Thats why YC only gives people a small bit of money as seed. They know that there is no need to spend that much. Where you do need money is to scale the operations and that varies a lot from business to business. Cherry would have been able to scale without much money, because they did not do anything themselves (the sub contracted the work).<p>I do appreciate that you took the time to reply, but I have real world experience with this, whereas you only are speculating while using Silicon Valley startup logic to it.
