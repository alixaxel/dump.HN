I've replied to the MailChimp newsletter before with my thoughts or questions and on multiple occasions have gotten a response back from Ben within an hour or two with a thoughtful, specific response to my email. I also sent a rant to him after we had some trouble with MailChimp and he apologized and worked to make it right within a day.<p>The lesson you should take away from Ben isn't how to respond to unfair post - it's that you should be always open to communication (positive or negative) and that you should respond as a polite, respectful human, not as a ""company"" voice.<p>As a result of my interactions with Ben and his incredible product, I'm a loyal MailChimp user and regularly recommend them to people looking to setup newsletters for their companies.",1354330781

It really depends on how html vs. text affects:\na) your open rates\nb) your clickthrough rates\nc) your sales conversion rates\nd) your long term lifetime value and visitor value.<p>It's very dangerous to make decisions about ""html vs. text"" based upon one's own personal preference - or even HN readers (unless that's your target audience).<p>What do you know about your audience? That's what I always say when chatting with friends and colleagues.<p>As an example, are the majority of your users using gmail, hotmail, yahoo, aol?\nOr, are they using personal and/or academic addresses?<p>These different mailing providers treat html vs text quite differently.<p>The style of your email can affect whether or not you get inboxed (hence every action step from open rates, to ctr rates to sales will be affected).<p>What's the demo of your audience? If one has an older crowd, perhaps plain text may be easier to read.<p>A younger crowd? Perhaps xyz percentage more of them are reading via mobile devices. This would also affect the decision.<p>The Email Experience Council at the DMA has some great research on this topic - check their Youtube channel.<p>But above all I'm a big fan of making data-driven decisions based on a clear awareness of what your audience's behavior suggests - not on personal preferences or HN likes - IHMO.<p>Also HTML may be more appealing but text may drive more goal conversions.<p>Has anyone else seen better overall ROI with text, even though they personally have more of a preference for HTML?<p>added:\n<a href=""http://www.emailexperience.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emailexperience.org/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/EmailExperience"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/EmailExperience</a>",1354330724

The ""Humble Android Bundle"", ""Humble Ebook Bundle"", and so on are also diluting the brand.<p>But this one goes against some of the basic tenets of the Humble Bundle series; namely, the DRM-free, cross-platform nature. One of the reasons I support them is that I support choice. I want to have choice in what platform I run. I want to have choice in what machines I run my games on. DRM and single-platform games mean that I don't have that choice.<p>All I'm saying is that in the past, I've bought Humble Bundles and never even played a single game, just because I supported the idea so much. Now they've violated some of their core principles; they are still ""pay what you want"" and allow supporting charities, but they are selling games that I am morally opposed to. I'm better off just giving my money to the charities directly.",1354330477

It would work in places that GPS can't (like caves).<p>To me, that's really awesome.

This so far sounds ordinary but:<p>The cool thing was that I forgot to write the bounds check to make sure the ant stayed inside the framebuffer! So the ant would happily trundle off-screen, encounter arbitrary bits that were in that memory, and would often eventually return back on the screen from a different location.

I haven't read any of Ravitch's work directly yet, and enough time has passed since I heard her speak that I don't remember her position reliably anymore.<p>> Start with John Dewey and William Torrey Harris (for a counterpoint to Dewey).<p>I'm a fairly huge fan of John Dewey. I only barely hold back from calling myself a philosophical pragmatist in Dewey's tradition. On the other hand, I kinda recognize Harris' notion as a tradition I'd reject; Wikipedia's characterization of his supporters' arguments suggests that there isn't anything really useful in his ideas that doesn't require stripping it bare first. :P<p>> Literally every point everyone has been making in this thread -- myself included -- was also being made by educational thinkers 100-150 years ago.<p>But this is not experimentation. There is a difference between a thought experiment and an <i>actual</i> experiment. Schrodinger did not actually put a cat in a box and mysteriously wave his hands to express the quantum uncertainty of its aliveness.<p>Yes, we have some tiny movements like Montessori schools or project-based learning or Quest to Learn or KIPP's character training or charter schools and so on and so on, but they make such an infinitesimal impact and are often so incomparable that it doesn't make sense to call it ""experimentation"". The fact that Will Wright, Sergey Brin, and Jeff Bezos are all Montessori graduates, for instance, gets noticed sometimes but also gets <i>mocked</i> a portion of that. (That is, the term ""Montessori graduate"" is sometimes used derogatorily.)<p>> I meant to draw attention to exactly your point, that we've set up a situation where universities are directionless because we've asked them to be everything to everyone.<p>I don't think that the answer is to unbundle it, though. That's an easy, dare I say Silicon-Valley-esque response to a difficult and multifarious beast, but it's not necessarily the right one. I think that it'd be worthwhile to shed some of those things, yes, but for their invalidity or overgeneralizations on their own merits, rather than because they detract from a university's capacity to be itself.<p>I am working on an answer myself, naturally... but I've so far declined to try to untangle the nature of a university on my own. It feels like putting the cart before the horse to do so. I've mostly held to a single, simple principle: a university experience should be optional. If people feel compelled to go to a university after some particular amount of basic education, such as high school, then the problems of a university are symptoms, not causes.",1354329210
