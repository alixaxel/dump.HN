His argument was that the Tea Party had successfully done this and were on the far right of every issue. The occupiers could take up the room on the far left side and make their case.<p>Ultimately American politics continue to be corrupt and not even Obama could change that.

4700490,comment,4700160,4700383,77,0,dandelany,,,"I'm so tired of this mentality that says basically, if you release something for free on the internet, you are obligated to maintain and support it for the rest of your life. Gruber created this program, for free. You are under no obligation to use it. Don't like it? Here's your money back. It may be true that the code is shit. If you think so, don't use it.<p>Like other responders, I worry that this mentality causes fewer coders to release their projects, for fear of backlash like this post. Think about it: Your feelings toward Gruber are incredibly negative and hostile, and in fact, you would have better feelings toward him if he had kept Markdown to himself and never released it at all. Does that seem fair to you? If the ill will generated by people like yourself outweighs the good will generated by those who appreciate the code I release, or if I fear that it might, what motivation do I have to release my code?",1351216615

4700476,comment,4700160,4700384,5,0,AngryParsley,,,"To fix the ambiguous grammar, we need to add a url parser to markdown? This is a perfect example of how changes that seem simple to humans can have enormous impacts on software complexity. As you said, introducing that complexity wouldn't help in many cases:<p><pre><code>  Blah blah blah (side note)[1](#ref_1).\n  Blah blah blah (side note)[1](ref_1.html).\n</code></pre>\nI don't mean to be hostile, but just because something is ""doable"" doesn't mean it should go in the spec. Adding things to a standard imposes costs that feature-proposers rarely consider. It forces programmers to write more code to support that feature. More code means more bugs. These bugs annoy users and cost valuable programmer time. Multiply these costs by the number of times the standard is implemented and you can easily end up with millions in lost value.<p>Vanilla markdown doesn't require a url parser. It doesn't have ambiguous grammar. It's small. It's simple. And that's a good thing, because markdown parsers have enough bugs in them already.",1351216240

4700417,comment,4694776,4698654,1,0,cmccabe,,,"You say ""C stutters even more"" but your example is not an apples-to-apples comparison.  You split the C version up into two lines, whereas the C++ version is one line.  The issue really is that type names tend to be a lot longer in C++ than they are in C, and so the ""same"" amount of reptition hurts a lot more.  auto will help with this a little bit.  But you're still going to end up using typedef a lot to shorten those type names.  Especially for anything where you're using an iterator.  Trust me, I've been there.<p>typedef'ing structs is an anti-pattern in C.  See <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle</a>.  Basically the rationale is that the fact something is a struct is useful information which should be reflected in the type name.<p>So you use constructors and destructors.  Good job, but how to you report errors from those constructors and destructors?  Even if you're willing to use exceptions (and most experienced C++ users, like Google, Mozilla, etc are not), you can't safely throw one from a destructor, because of the risk of triggering std::terminate.  So you usually end up writing your own init() and shutdown() functions for most non-trivial classes anyway.  But you still have to define the useless constructor anyway, because hmm, C++ doesn't see fit to zero your class fields of POD type.  Now don't try using memset-- you know better than that.  Better specify what you want to initialize each one to individually in a long assignment list.  And let's not forget to define a copy constructor and an assignment operator, or else you'll get screwed when someone copies your class bit-wise and does a double free.<p>Sound familiar?  This is all adding up to a lot of boilerplate that you wouldn't have to deal with in C.  Syntactic shackles is more like.",1351214579

There can't be two sequential odd results during normal (non-initial) iterations. For that matter, if the initial input is odd, the output will be even after at most two iterations (3(3n+1)+1=6n+4=2(3n+2), which is even), after which it's business as usual. So, we only really have to consider sequences beginning from an even n to see what's really going on.<p>f(n:even) can yield an odd or an even value. Permuted:<p>f(f(f(n:even):odd):odd)<p><pre><code>    is impossible (see above).\n</code></pre>\nf(f(f(n:even):even):even)=((n/2)/2)/2=n/8<p><pre><code>    is less than the initial (n:even) for n>8\n</code></pre>\nf(f(f(n:even):even):odd)=3((n/2)/2)+1=(3/4)n+1<p><pre><code>    is less than the initial (n:even) for n>4\n</code></pre>\nf(f(f(n:even):odd):even)=(3(n/2)+1)/2=(3/4)n+1/2<p><pre><code>    is less than the initial (n:even) for n>4\n</code></pre>\nI conclude: no cycles while n>8 and no infinite divergent trajectories while n>8.<p>You can't have cycles OR divergent infinite trajectories while n>8 since no output, after 3 iterations, may exceed the initial (even) input. In other words, pick any 4 sequential numbers BEGINNING with an EVEN number (the initial even input and the results of 3 consecutive iterations) and the 4th number will always be smaller than the 1st number - whether the final number is even OR odd, or there were some biggies in the middle of the list.
