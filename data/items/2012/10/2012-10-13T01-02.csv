How will my browser do things such as autofill usernames and passwords, allow links to be opened in new tabs, block third-parties from tracking me with cookies, or allow me to globally change my font preferences if each web page actually uses a different ""browser"" that it downloaded, and whose only connection to the outside is IP and a framebuffer? Or how would a browser be able to give me crisper text on a Retina display with no change to web pages, or provide hardware-accelerated threaded scrolling, or let me play video with hardware-accelerated decoding?<p>(These are a few of the things that, as a browser engineer, I expect could not be done in this model.)<p>Also as a Mac user, I expect this would result in many forms in web pages giving me controls that look and act like Windows.<p>Against these likely disadvantages, the advantages seem slim. We already have good ways to distribute sandboxed native apps. The Web doesn't need to become one of them.",1350093466

4647493,comment,4646572,4647232,8,0,dsiroker,,,"Thanks for the long and thoughtful comment. I'll try to answer all of your questions point by point.<p>Regarding the 1.3 billion visitors: we define this as the sum of all the unique visitors to each experiment that have been run through Optimizely. We purposely avoided calling them 1.3 billion ""unique"" visitors because some people will be bucketed into multiple experiments and across multiple customers. We purposely do NOT include people who were not bucketed as part of the experiment/control groups. If we did, this number would likely be much higher since many of our customers use our traffic allocation feature that let's them only sample a small fraction of their traffic to include in the experiment: <a href=""http://support.optimizely.com/customer/portal/articles/581962-traffic-allocation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.optimizely.com/customer/portal/articles/58196...</a><p>I wholeheartedly agree with your point that many of the players who started after 2008 have far superior implementations due to the advancements in browser technologies which T&T failed to capitalize. We certainly stand on the shoulders of giants. We would not exist as a company without jQuery, Akamai, Google App Engine, and Amazon Web Services. Not to mention the fact that browsers are much faster and can execute JavaScript in real-time to manipulate the DOM before the page is rendered in the browser and shown to the user.<p>As for revenue numbers: one of the advantages we have as a startup is that we are not required to publicly tell the world how big we are. If Omniture knew how big we were they might actually allocate resources to try to improve their products.<p>You are right that many of our 2,800+ customers pay us far more than our highest listed price of $399.<p>As for top customers in the categories you mentioned we are thrilled to have Disney, Starbucks, Salesforce, Crate&Barrel, GoDaddy, Footlocker, Electronic Arts, CareerBuilder, and more. It's refreshing to see companies that are traditionally ""sold to"" using a enterprise sales approach who are eager to embrace the shift to more nimble products that ""just work."" Old school sales tactics are falling on deaf ears as companies shift toward purchasing more like consumers. The vast majority of our customers come to us through word-of-mouth. We are riding the wave of the consumerization of enterprise.",1350090309

Win-win!<p>That said, the article title (I'm not going to give them a pageview) is nothing but trolly flamebait, and never should have made it to HN.
