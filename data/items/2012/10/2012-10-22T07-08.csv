4682191,comment,4681304,4682018,2,0,ggopman,,,"Here's a full breakdown on hack sponsorships...maybe it'll make it in your next post ;)<p>HACK SPONSORSHIPS<p>Non-college hackathons are sponsored mostly from Platform Marketing departments that want developers to use their toolkits. Inspired by ""the greats"" like Twilio and 10gen, most developer tool companies are looking for ways to get their tools known and used by developers and are willing to pay to do it. Good examples are: Heroku, Pusher, Apigee, Mashery, Cloudmine, Mailchimp, Box, Firebase, Pearson, New Relic.<p>Some like Apigee will only sponsor if they can be the top prized API or headline sponsor for the event. Some like Mashery will try to convince you that they don't have money (they do), but that they'll bring a bunch of people to your event (they wont), others like Microsoft will pay if you can integrate an appealing Windows 8 vertical, and then there are those like New Relic who will sponsor if they believe you are doing good for the community and want to show support #nerdlife (this is an extremely rare breed though, so don't count on finding too many like this). There are lots of Platform marketing teams out there with a lot of different budgets and reasons to sponsor. If you can align your hackathon with their initiatives then you can land some good ones.<p>After that, there's recruiting -- The recruiting bucks come easy if you're a top tier engineering school.  Most of the big companies I know only want to hire top devs and will pay for creative ways like this to brand themselves to them. The only non-college hacks a recruiting sponsor will pay for are the mega hackathon events that bring everyone out of the woodworks - (ex. Photo Hack Day, Disrupt Hackathon, AngelHack).<p>Lastly, there is sponsorships from organizations sponsoring entrepreneurship  (Kauffman, BizSpark, Google Entrepreneurship, Ford). These deals normally take 6-18 months, but are completely worth it if you can land one. They cut monster checks (normally 6-7 figures) and will guarantee the growth and sustainability of your event. However, you have to prove you're creating a scalable model for entrepreneurship (ex. StartX, AngelList).<p>And should all else fail there are ticket sales. If you're scrappily putting your hackathon together, want to see it scale (which means hiring people to help organize), and you don't have big entrepreneurship sponsors onboard yet, then you should probably charge for tickets. Either that or be willing to pay out of your own pocket if ANYTHING goes wrong. and like most events, it almost always does...",1350891885

Sure you can take OK photos with a phonemaybe 2% of the time you can take a good photos with decent camera. As the name implies, photography is first about light. A good camera and lens immensly expands the definition of what acceptable light is. An off-camera flash
will make a night and day (pun intended) difference in your photos.<p>You mention timging. Autofocus speed and accuracy, shutter lag of DSLR and phone camera are not even comparable.<p>In short: moving from phone camera to an entry level DSLR with kit lenses will already be a huge step up in quality of your photos. If you understand what you are doing buying expensive lenses will add a noticeable increase to that as well. Then if you understand what are you doing and do it a lot buing a professional body will get you durability and the maximum control over the process (and ability to control aperture, shutter speed and ISO does matter too).<p>Yes, if you ""get it"" you can take a good photos with the phone if you are if conditions are favourable. But if you get it, then using DSLR will let you take more good photos, because the limits of favourable conditions are expanded a lot.<p>There is some truth in your last sentence, however from technical point of view, even is someone ""does not get it"" and would take crappy pictures on the phone then with an expensive kit he can have  pictures of the same crap but with much higher quality.",1350889801
