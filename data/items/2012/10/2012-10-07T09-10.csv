4622987,comment,4622532,4622708,1,0,ProblemFactory,,,"The problem with most recruiting sites is the lack of (competent) candidates.<p>And this is because highly competent candidates are never deliberately looking for a job. They get recruited to a pretty good job before they have even started thinking of jobs from college, and then get recruited to other companies by an old friend. It's extremely rare that they are ever considering themselves to be a ""job seeker"" at all.<p>These people don't bother reading recruitment-only sites in their free time. And they certainly don't want to create a job-seeking profile, and get in trouble with their boss who thinks they may be leaving.<p>But what they are very interested in is reading about their field of speciality. When I was sourcing candidates, the only online places where I found qualified engineers were the StackOverflow and 37signals job boards. These two are successful because they built the <i>community and content</i> that competent candidates want to visit daily first, and added a job board second. I have no expertise in mechanical engineering, but GrabCad seems to be doing it well in that area.<p>So my theory for running a successful recruiting site is:<p>1. Choose a single profession, skill, or field.
2. Create seed content yourself to attract initial experts in that field.
3. Add community features to let these initial experts contribute more content.
4. When you have become a well-known site for most experts in the field, add job boards.",1349602722

4622978,comment,4621268,4622920,1,0,grey-area,,,"I approach this slightly differently when contracting in order to get a spec everyone can agree on.<p>1. I ask the client for a brief (an outline of what they want, not a detailed spec, the general <i>what</i> rather than how, when or why).<p>2. I give them a spec which satisfies the brief, highlights any areas they might not have thought of, and outlines exactly how the work will be done and what it will entail (and what it won't), and how long it will take in days of work (not days on the calendar), broken down into small subunits of several days each.<p>3. We sign off on the spec (with any revisions they want), agree on a schedule (based on the time estimates with plenty of padding added for feedback, approval stages etc), and I start work.<p>The padding for the schedule (perhaps 3 x work days) won't cost them extra, and is there to cover the inevitable friction that working in groups produces, but if you're contracting you can spend that time waiting for feedback doing other work, so it comes at no cost to both parties. Probably the padding increases as the size of the company you're working for does.<p>I've never received a spec from a client that I was completely happy with, so it's easier to turn it around and accept a brief describing their goals in general terms, then give them a detailed description of how, when and why I would produce what they want. Asking them for the detailed specification, or even accepting one from them without lots of discussion, usually leads to problems as you're relying on the client to specify things they may not fully understand, you're asking them to tell you exactly how to do all the work, and by starting with their spec and mangling it or forcing lots of compromises, you make them feel they're not getting what they want. Whereas turning this around and giving them a spec lets you explain the cost/benefit of all decisions up front, and still gives them room to add/remove things as they wish as they approve the spec.<p>I do this even for design work as well as programming work, as there are a surprising number of constraints which a client may not consider, but will wish by the end of a project they had. All that said, most of my best ideas come from clients half way through a project, so you can't expect things not to remain fluid - that's just the nature of creation - as long as changes <i>improve</i> the end result and don't have knock-on effects I welcome them.<p>I'm not really convinced the article is correct in estimating 1 day as the horizon over which most developers can't see - in my experience that's too low, and it'd be more like several days, and as long as you split tasks up when estimating, it's not hard to estimate the <i>actual hours worked</i> - far harder is to estimate the friction introduced by bureaucracy and politics in larger organisations. I suspect that's where most inaccuracies in scheduling creep in.",1349602313

It follows (awkwardly) you cannot reject the hypothesis that genetics are determinate, by rejecting analysis on race-based data.  But that is only the tip of the iceberg of problems here.<p>There is a logical problem and a data problem. The data problem is that race is not a <i>proxy</i> for genetic variation, per-se (mixed data). The logic problem is that rejecting race as a hypothetical causal relationship does not reject genetic variable (by proxy, since proxy=false). Furtermore, rejecting the alternative hypothesis (ie, genetics) does not default to a single variable solution (ie Envronment or Genetics is origin).  You cannot reject the hypothesis that they BOTH are important. Logically, they are not binary, per observation.<p>The takeaway is that the headline is a problem. Reducing Environment to a one of many simultaneous causal factors trivializes it.<p>Rejecting genetic determinants as having significant explanatory power is counter-thetical to Evolution. This is an orthogonal point, but its important.  The Environment being ""origin"" implies that mate selection is irrelevant to inherited/expressed/realized intelligence. Which is clearly false. As a observed or as a logical matter.<p>Think of a car engine.  Every manufacturer will have defects (manufacturing tolerances).  And poor maintenance will cause every engine to eventually fail (ie, dont change the oil). So, (1) design is not determinate of performance fully; and (2) environment can determine ultimate success/failure. It does not follow that all egines have the same layout for internal cumbustion. Nor does it follow that when working at full capacity/optimim tune they will have the same power output. Nor can we conclude anything about the suspension or the chassis performance, etc. But nor does it follow that ultimate performance (of the complex system) cannot still be competitive (at least in certain environments, etc). Cars of various design are competitive at road-rally, for example.<p>While genetics is certainly not 100% explanatory, it simply is and must be a component in the ""origin of intelligence"".  Unless you are a crazy-tea-party-sceptic-of-evolution.[sic]. So, this is problem for the intelligensia/left if they want to divorce inherited/genetics from the disucussion.<p>The problem is the level of abstaction.  We know genetics matters by species.  We know genetics matters by (nuclear) family.  What are the in-between levels (if any) that also matter?  That is where things get murky and messy (politically, logically, and otherwise).  At some stage, this might also be analysed of as a question of entropy.  ie, if two smart people get married and their kids are x/n likelt to be smart, at what stage in replication do they revert to x/n= population average. If ever? What if their is persistent top-quartile genetic pairings (ie, adding selective-diversity, etc). What if their is a random sample from the population? Are the two vcases the same or different? how do you tell/test? etc.<p>None of which should give cover for thinking without due clarity, however.",1349602059

I was promised a decent amount of preferred stock options which 'would make me rich', and joined on a salary about 15k less than I could have earned at an established company down the road.<p>Over the next few months, while the company size went from 6 to 20, and the board were organising the stock options scheme, I was still highly motivated by the favourable options which had yet to be sorted out. A year in, and I was given a very very small fraction of the 11% option pool, which would amount to less than 0.1% of the total shares, which was also subject to dilution. At this point I had all of the speculation previously made by my superiors denied, my importance to the company was downgraded, and I struggled to negotiate a raise in salary that would bring me up to what I'd call an average salary.<p>This whole procedure was very demoralising, I would have been happy with no options and a decent salary to start with, and all of the speculation of how many billions the company would get acquired for in a years' time would not have bothered me in the slightest. After all, we had no customers, had not launched a product, and I was a key developer. Needless to say I left shortly after to start my own company.<p>When I left, they offered to 'do something' about the options and give me the raise I wanted, but at that point for me the damage had been done, and I no longer had the ambition to work there. I didn't execute any of the options that had already vested, and used this 300 to start my business.<p>From my own experience and speaking with a lot of other startup employees in the UK, I believe we care more about the starting salary, and absolutely have to treat options as a bonus. Not only because of the dampened IPO/acquisition outlook in Europe, which i think many startup employees are unaware of, but because startups are a smaller part of our economy. In London for example, 'Tech City' is right next to THE city, where my friends work. You've got guys earning nothing at a startup, working and meeting for drinks, and living with friends who work at banks down the road. I would imagine the US startup scene feels much more like a microcosm, and because we are yet to have that level of separation in culture and circles we socialise in, the difference in lifestyle a salary gives you is a lot more noticeable.<p>I regret not adapting this mentality from the start, and when we hire our first employee, I will certainly make sure the reason they are taking the job is not the millions they are guaranteed to make in a few years' time.",1349601919

4622949,comment,4620423,4620951,2,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"Bit-aligned instructions are a really horrible idea if you ever want to make a CPU implementing that instruction set actually fast. When you want to decode multiple instructions in parallel, having more possible locations for the beginning of the next instruction adds a lot of latency and power on a very critical path. Getting more cache to fit instructions and more bandwidth from it to the cpu is a problem that can be solved by Moore's law, having to put more muxes in front of your decoder isn't, now that Moore's law just buys you more transistors and less power, but not faster transistors.<p>x86 is now considered to be extremely hard to decode because it's byte-aligned instructions, and basically all modern instruction sets prefer fixed-width instructions. ARM used to tout how space-efficient it's THUMB-2/ARMv7 instruction set was compared to other RISC instruction sets because it had 2 possible instruction lengths (16b and 32b), but now that they got to (had to) reboot the ISA for 64-bit, ARMv8 is fixed-width.",1349601394

Firstly, instructions are primarily fit in the instruction cache, not the data cache.<p>Secondly, there is no signifcant address translation overhead and the os doesn't need to do any decision making (or well, it does, but it is cached in the TLB and code TLBs are so efficienct nowadays that you can expect the cost to be null) so long as the resident set fits in the main ram -- whether it fits in the cache or not is irrelevant.<p>Thirdly, just how does the disklessness of the system have any influence?

Answer: 1. Immediate delivery, assuming Bob and Alice keep their machines online.  2. No spam.  3. No third parties exerting control over their mail.  No idiosyncratic delivery policies.<p>I'm afraid there's no need to convince any provider of anything.  At this point, Alice and Bob are sending and receiving email without the need for any third party ""email provider"".<p>Functionally blacklists and whitelists are the same.  They both have the same goal.  But they are not the same in their effect.  Blacklisting an entire netblock to stop one bad IP address affects many IP addresses who do not need to be blocked.  Whitelisting a single known IP address does not have that side effect.  For Alice and Bob, handling their own messages may be a desired option.  Of course, not everyone may follow Alice and Bob's example.  But who cares?  The population using email is enormous and diverse.  The point is that if someone wants a better solution than what ""email providers"" offer, she can get it.",1349600413
