The sooner this happens the better, since it will mean much better software overall.   Mail clients, word processors and mapping applications should not be written in javascript.<p>It's a damn shame that the OS vendors refuse to work together to make easily cross-platform native applications a reality.  Thankfully though, if they create frictionless ways to use native code, frameworks and what not should be able to bridge the gap between OS specific API's and the hardware without performance issues.  Moore's law will never make javascript word-processors good.<p>Javascript on the back-end just makes no sense to me whatsoever.

You are super privileging teacher training as some sort of silver bullet solution, but missing the larger system that works actively against the outcome. You are undervaluing the various pressures which get applied to education, one important one being parent desires to see their kid succeed.<p>It doesn't matter if the kid understands or not. It doesn't matter if he can answer more important questions but isn't able to perfectly prove a theorem.<p>No amount of teacher training can stand in the face of a single determined parent who wants their kid to <i>ace that test</i>.<p>Heck a more trivial point which is still important? - teacher empowerment must come hand in hand with training, because each student is vastly different even from him or herself depending on what time of the day/month or year it is. Teachers must be able to make graded and customized judgement constantly. Tests don't allow for that.<p>Moving the power for measurement into the hands of the test dis-empowers teachers. The test becomes/IS all that matters here, not the education.<p>And Tests only roughly measure learning. They MOST strongly measure whether you could answer that particular test.<p>The test is all that matters.<p>As a result, the kind of teaching you value, becomes deprecated. Its just not economically competitive. As the original article posits. You don't need teachers to pass the test. You need drill Sergeants.<p>Teachers who are good at that are the ones who will come to the fore, other teachers don't matter.<p>You could love your subject and instill it in students. But that doesn't guarantee a good grade. Loving a subject, being\ninvolved in it, and testing well in it are different. Especially if you don't ""think the test"".<p>This is the final pressure - loving a subject or enjoying it is irrelevant. Students care <i>even</i> less, they know that as long as that they get the test - its all good. ""I'm getting good marks In a stupid subject like chemistry, who cares?"".<p>Do you want those people becoming your computer science engineers?<p>The system you are setting up is concerning, and no amount of teacher training will solve it.<p>-----<p>Further I think you are talking about standardized tests America had 30 or so years ago. Speaking on behalf of student body of India - we would have loved to have tests like that.<p>At least in America you had the option of making a life if you had some gumption even if you didn't ace those tests. You were a person as opposed to a Frankenstinian mental athlete.<p>Our tests were/are compulsory, for many people not in their first language, and they determined everything from your social standing to your marriage prospects. You started studying for your tenth standard exam 2 years before they started, you had no vacation and you had no spare time.<p>Then 2 years later you would do it for your ISC or IIT or CAT.",1351589886

Event-based asynchronous servers are nice for some things, but definitely not for everything. If that were the case, Twistd and Tornado would have been much more popular before Node.js even existed.

4716703,comment,4716579,4716579,2,0,FooBarWidget,,,"I modded this submission up not because I agree with it but because I want a discussion. The G-WAN author has been known being... confident. He claims to be faster and more scalable than Nginx by a significant factor. He attributes the speed partially to the fact that his code contains few branches, where he defines even function calls as branches. Both statements are bold claims, and I can only imagine how it would take a genius to maintain ""branchless"" code like that.<p>Leaving that aside, I feel that the article focuses too much on the hype words. Yes some of the hype is over the top and focuses too much on the coolness factor, yes some of the reasons given for using Node is total nonsense (e.g. what he quoted from the Wikipedia article). But none of that invalidates the valid reasons for choosing Node:<p>- Javascript is so much easier to program for than C/C++. This is a fact; he mentioned it several times in his article but then brushes off these claims. Writing Phusion Passenger 4's new evented architecture in C++ has been an extremely intensive effort. There's just so much you need to be aware of and take care of, Javascript would have speeded up development significantly. If course we couldn't and didn't: being system software, Phusion Passenger's core cannot rely on Javascript and must be optimized for speed.<p>- Javascript is <i>fast enough</i> for quite a lot of server software. Of course C wipes the floor with everything. If you don't mind spending 4 times longer to ship your product to market. Oh yeah, good luck recruiting that brilliant C programmer, I hope you live in a place where they are easy to come by. His bold claim that G-WAN's Javascript engine uses 2444x less resources is a bold one, but if in the end you have 2 million users and you can still handle them with 1 or 2 servers, then switching to G-WAN does not give you a lot of added advantage.<p>- G-WAN runs everything in-process!! Of course everything is faster then!!! It's because there's no need to perform inter-process communication and CPU synchronization, which often require (relatively slow) kernel intervention. But if one component dies, your entire web server goes down. Better hope the application programmer never makes a mistake. With Phusion Passenger we've explicitly chosen not to utilize an in-process architecture because it causes to much pain, even if it's faster.<p>There's also at least one logical fallacy in the article:<p>_""Node.js' CPU & RAM usage is so high that the scale had to be resized. The chaotic curves do not give the feeling of anything seriously engineered.""_<p>He puts two separate scales in the same graph and then claims this? That doesn't make any sense.<p>Where is the source code for the benchmark? How did the benchmark look like and what's the methodology? No mention of it.<p>I wish the G-WAN author would focus more on the technicalities instead of trying to fight the hype. That would make the entire article much more interesting. Why is G-WAN faster? What's the difference between Node and G-WAN's Javascript engine? Etcetera. G-WAN is a very interesting product but it would have so much more potential if the author communicates in a less inflammatory and emotional way, and behaves more professionally.",1351589653
