Instead, the company wants to pay some percentage of an employee's current salary.<p>As someone who has certain entrepreneurial aspirations, I sort of understand where they're coming from.

4667287,comment,4663946,4666188,4,0,wpietri,,,"One of the interesting reasons comes back to accounting.<p>Toyota's approach focuses on value from the customer perspective. So all defects are seen as waste, and are targeted for elimination.<p>The MBA approach just looks at P&L. Which is why they concealed the Pinto's tendency to explode; it was cheaper to pay the lawsuits than to fix people's tanks. Nevermind that many more people would die without the recall; that wasn't relevant to increasing shareholder value.<p>Another good example comes at the beginning of Bob Lutz's ""Car Guys vs Bean Counters"". Lutz, a car lover and an automotive exec for decades, once fixed a problem with transmission manufacturing. The problem was causing a lot of people's cars to die right after the warranty expired. He got yelled at because it blew a hole in their revenue projections; they were looking forward to a lot of highly profitable transmission repairs.<p>Toyota can make those reliable cars because they see every worker not just as a meat robot, but as a brain that should be engaged in eliminating waste. MBA thinking looks at slow order periods as a time to cut labor costs. Toyota, cognizant of how much they have invested in their workers, looks it as a time for training, plant improvement, and other value-creating activities.",1350529110

One day I was sitting in an empty parking lot with my girlfriend eating pizza on the tailgate and watching traffic go by. A cop came along and ticketed a driver for rolling through the stop sign. As soon as the cop turned off her lights, another car rolled through the stop sign, and she lit that driver up as well. This continued for probably 5-10 drivers before the officer came up to us and asked if we were enjoying the show. She said she hopes everyone involved learned a lesson about stopping completely at stop signs. I offered her a slice of pizza, she declined, and we drove off.<p>I guess my take-away from that was, cops can give out tickets in short order if people are consistently breaking the law right in front of them. I wouldn't necessarily punish an officer for giving out many tickets in a high-offending area, just based on what I saw that day. Sometimes people in an area need to have the rules reinforced.

And I think there's a reason there's a different meaning, that's pretty intricately tied to social notions of gender.  While gender is largely socially constructed, rites of passage for respective genders are even more so.<p>In many cultures, young men go through a rite of passage to prove they're men.  They <i>prove</i> their masculinity--not show it, prove it, usually overcoming some obstacle.  They kill a lion, for instance.  Women go through rites of passage too, but they do not involve proof, rather show.  This does not mean the challenges involved are easier.  It simply means their role in the final evaluation is passive rather than active.  The reason men are active in their judgment and women passive reflects back on the opposite gender, because men judge women and women judge men.  Men are looking for traits that are visible, women for traits of character.<p>You could argue this is all because men are shallow and women are not, and you'd be right for reasons due, in turn, with the gametic, game-theoretical origin of asymmetries between men and women.<p>So there are fundamental reasons why it's not the same thing to say ""separate the men from the boys"" and ""separate the women from the girls.""",1350526185
