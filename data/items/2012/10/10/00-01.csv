The Law should not be made for securing the rights of the merchants (in your case the bookshops) but for benefiting the greater good, i.e. widespread access to books for everyone.

SoundExchange in turn pays the appropriate rights holder. This might be an artist, directly, but often it's a record label. The labels don't like the revenue flowing through SoundExhange because the process is transparent to their artists. Which means they can't hide the money.<p>Pandora also pays the publishers for the performance right, separately from SoundExchange. This can be a fixed percentage of revenue.

4634564,comment,4633154,4634207,2,0,gwf,,,"I am the founder/CEO of Clipboard.  Thanks for taking the time to read our privacy policy.  I'll do my best to answer each question, but please let me know if you think that I missed anything.<p>1. Web beacons are typically understood to be any sort of tracking mechanism.  We track emails via Sendgrid to see how effective they are.  We use Google analytics to see where and how people are using the site.  We use mixpanel to better understand how people use individual features.  All of this is pretty standard stuff.<p>A non-standard thing that we do is that we put in place a secret key on the client local storage of your Web browser which we use to protect our user's accounts.  Here's how it works... we can transmit the secret one time over HTTPS.  Then, when you create a clip on a 3rd party site, we can redirect the clip payload via XDM to our own domain, and then digitally sign the API call with the secret key.  This (a) prohibits a bad guy from spamming your clip account, and (b) makes it so no one else can see the shared secret (even though this partially runs on other domains).<p>2. Re. the buy / sell language ... we do not now nor have we ever sold any information to any 3rd party about anything, nor do we have any intention of doing so.  The first sentence is meant to make that clear.  The second sentence says that we my buy or sell more general assets (for example, we purchased some patents last year and with it came a user database with emails from a retired service).<p>So, our stated intension is to never sell any personal information about any customers.  I think that it is possible that some day we may sell aggregated data, but we're not there yet.  And if we made any change, then we would clearly owe our users an update on the change in policy.<p>I, nor any other CEO, cannot guarantee what happens if we are ever sold.  We can do our best to have a outcome that's good for everyone, but in this there can be no guarantees.  FWIW, we destroyed the database that came with that earlier deal because it seemed like the right thing to do.<p>3. Our privacy policy and ToS have been the same for over a year.  I think we may have fixed a typo once or twice during that time.  If we ever do a major update -- one that materially changes the terms for anyone -- I think we'll send such an update via email.  However, I suspect that most users do not welcome such emails, so we're trying to walk the line that is clear, transparent, and not annoying.<p>4. We don't have a bulk export tool, nor do we have an external API, but we'll get there soon.  The API is fairly mature, but we still need to add an OATH2 layer.  However, here's a stop gap:  Suppose you want to export a clip, like this one: <a href=""http://clipboard.com/clip/LQYHMLUq21-yNhdiYu1BUYzGdFQOUfUFEQ1e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clipboard.com/clip/LQYHMLUq21-yNhdiYu1BUYzGdFQOUfUFEQ...</a>.  If you change the URL to <a href=""http://clipboard.com/api/v1/clips/LQYHMLUq21-yNhdiYu1BUYzGdFQOUfUFEQ1e"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clipboard.com/api/v1/clips/LQYHMLUq21-yNhdiYu1BUYzGdF...</a>, then you'll get the JSON for the clip.  And if you take the blob GUID from that clip object, you could hit <a href=""http://clipboard.com/api/v2/blobs/BLOGGUID"" rel=""nofollow"">http://clipboard.com/api/v2/blobs/BLOGGUID</a>.  But, trust me, we'll make this better for hackers before the year is out.<p>5. Money.  Like most a lot of startups, our evolution is designed to go from launch -> growth -> monetization.  We're only now entering the growth phase, so we're not going to focus on significant revenue at this time if it will hurt growth.  The exception to this is that we may offer some pro features sooner rather than later (e.g., Clipboard for teams).  Right now, we are having a lot of conversations with some of the biggest commerce and media companies in the world around ways to monetize Clipboard in a manner that is good for everyone.  But it will take time.<p>To be clear, we lose money every day -- but we're supposed to at this phase.  Your options are pretty clear.  You could bet on us, taking the risk that we don't last; or you can wait until we're profitable, which means that you'll be a late adopter.  It's up to you.  But I think that if you take a look at our team, our track record, and the choices that we've made over the past 18 months, you may find that we have the makings of a good group of people to bet on.",1349829859

Most prevalent technologies started in this way, include js. And most started in a much less 'open' way than NaCl. The point surely is not where they originate but rather whether they offer enough distinctive value that they are compelling enough to be adopted more widely and hence become a key part of our ecosystem. Hence the question is, does NaCl have such a compelling value proposition? Evidently, in Brandan's eyes, and those of several of his colleagues, the answer is no. But other people can disagree and hope that the value is sufficient to eventually win over a broader market share. A good example of such a community is those with large code bases in say C, or C++ who would rather port their code than rewrite it all with all the ensuing maintenance problems. Imho NaCl does have something distinctive to offer and I wish the project well.",1349829103

I signed a client's contract which basically said ""We provide work orders (PivotalTracker sprints), you code. If you finish, we pay; if not, we don't pay."" Fair enough. Hacked a few work orders, got paid. Finally there was one work order with a grizzly ticket well beyond the week's allocated hours. I suggested we break it up, or ice-box it. The client said no and insisted it be completed before they accept the work order. I chugged and chugged on this one ticket, until finally (as per the work order's due date) the contract was terminated.<p>Now, they have all my commits for that work order leading up to the final ticket (about $700 of my time). A lot of work down the drain. My question is, seeing as the whole shebang is either accepted or rejected (not individual tickets), should I remove all my commits for that work order, since I'm not being paid for them? A simple `git rebase -i ... git push --force` would do. I'm sure someone has a local clone and could figure it out (after some cursing). Possibly enough to leverage a payout on my work, otherwise (since that's been addressed in the contract) they'll just deal with the lost work order as I am.<p>I don't mean to be malicious, I'm not trying to haxor their bases; I just don't want them to have my work for free. I've looked through the contract and there's nothing addressing redacted IP on failed work orders as far as I can tell. Thoughts? More trouble than it's worth?",1349828441

Most nations operate on the premise that the best way to win a war is not to get into it in the first place.  However, war serves a useful purpose for the U.S.. It gives them a chance to test out the latest tech, make their contractors some money, reduce unemployment, and give the latest batch of west-point kids their manhood rights.  The U.S. will likely keep getting involved in wars periodically no matter how flimsy the pretext for them is.  What nature those wars will take is what is really interesting.<p>Obama's ""we can kill anyone we want, anywhere we want, anytime we want"" policy really does put an interesting spin on things.  If extraterritorial strikes had been commonplace ten years ago the Afghanistan war might never have happened.  Assuming bin Laden hadn't gone to ground by that point, they might simply have executed him without the Taliban state's permission, just as he was eventually killed without Pakistan's knowledge or permission.  Avoiding a war might have been worth the dubious legality of such an action, but it would have let a truly nasty genie out of its bottle (one that the U.S. later released anyways without stopping a war!).  What will happen when other nations inevitably follow the U.S.'s example?  Also, it's one thing to execute terrorists in this manner, but could the U.S. eventually pursue ""regime change"" this way?  How many pentagon generals are currently chomping at the bit to send drones out after Ali Khamenei?<p>In the end , the root of the problem really is that war is good for business and the U.S. political system is a thrall to business interests.
