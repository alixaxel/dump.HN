4658512,comment,4656076,4656752,1,0,philwelch,,,"Rebase is the reconciliation between feature branches and continuous integration. As soon as someone merges to the integration branch, you rebase off of it, and you're integrated. Fix any merge conflicts at rebase time and now your merge can just be a fast-forward. That way, every feature branch contains the state of the integration branch, if that feature branch were immediately merged in. In other words, every feature branch <i>is</i> an integration branch.<p>The difference is that instead of having dozens of half-features in the integration branch at once, you have an integration branch with no dead code that you can actually ship (continuous deployment, anyone?) because your fully-integrated feature branches only make it in when they're ready, no matter how big or small the feature might be. It also means that experiments or major new features can be worked on and then discarded, or simply shelved in favor of higher priority work.",1350363531

In the last 10 years, people learned that value destruction is the same as creation, when it comes to leverage in these scenarios. If you don't pay them $XYZ, they will destroy value or sit idly by as entropy does it for them. The mathematical equivalence of marginal productivity (what they teach in school) and marginal malevolence (street smarts) is elegant in its simplicity. That's how the game is played. One of the downsides of ""maximizing shareholder value"" as your guiding principle.[1]<p>With that in mind, look at a comp for COO pay:<p>Exec Comp Consuultant > <i>American businesswoman and the Chief Operating Officer of Facebook, Sheryl Sandberg, has an estimated net worth of $1.6 billion</i><p>Not justifying it, just pointing out the facts.<p>______<p>[1]  A Mature company is completely different dynamic than a (0,1) innovation scenario/startup, IMHO.

However, these days significant portions of our communications are carried, curated, and distributed only through corporations - to the point where many people rightly feel those corporations have at least as much effect on our life as the government, without being held to the same standards of course. Expecting only governments to honor rights such as free speech does feel a little anachronistic in a world that's increasingly controlled by powerful economic interests. Restricting the obligation to honor human rights to governments is starting to look like a giant loophole, a legislative bug emerging from a legacy system.<p>Though I do not share these concerns as far as message board moderation is concerned, I believe there is often a good reason why people tend to invoke free speech instinctively in these cases. The expectation is that basic rights are not so much special allowances patronizingly handed down from the government intended for an increasingly narrow context but should instead be understood as innate personhood rights enabling people to live a free and dignified life.",1350362512

I personally agree with this decision, since such an important part of using any API is knowing exactly what to put in and exactly what you're getting out.<p>However, closures <i>are</i> allowed to have all of their types inferred. This is because closures aren't allowed to exist at the top level of a file (in what's called ""item position""), and so you don't really have to worry about them being used by others. The closure equivalent of the heresy example would be:<p><pre><code>  // Note that the braces in this line are optional
  let heresy = || { ""I am the corruption lurking in your heart"" };
  // Though you're still allowed to be explicit, if you'd like
  let heresy = || -> &str { ""I am the corruption lurking in your heart"" };</code></pre>",1350361044

For me its been to have a more protein centric diet, which I've been able to adhere to long-term because I enjoy it. I only eat good quality meat (beef eye fillets, lamb racks/shanks, fresh fish like barramundi and snapper etc) which means I don't become fatigued by my limited choices. And I do a 5 minute exercise routine each day so that I have no excuse for skipping a day (high-intensity low-rep dumb-bell exercises - increasing the weight over time). I'm looking into getting a kettle-bell to mix things up, but intend to keep my daily routine at 5 very achievable minutes.<p>Another important aspect is understanding how carbohydrates, fats and proteins are metabolised. Merely understanding these things allows you to make informed choices. I've watched co-workers pain over their shabby appearance while slamming down an oversized cup of liquid fructose (juice) without thinking about it. Try drinking water - get rid of your naturally/unnaturally sweetened drinks and just sip water or green tea throughout the day. Need a coffee in the morning? Fine, get it out of the way and then make yourself a pot of tea and a tall glass of water for the remainder of the day. Make these things habits - not band aids. Focus on achievable lifestyle changes that you can maintain.<p>Lastly, look into supplements  but dont use them as a crutch. Some of the ones Ive experimented with are L-Tyrosine, 5HTP, 7-KETO, low-dose Aspirin, Nicotinamide (B3), Melatonin, Creatine, D3, Beta-Glucan and a few others that dont spring to mind. The ones I tend to use are more for neurotransmitter support/mental health, but there are some that can help speed up your BMR and RMR if you need that slight edge off the block (eg 7-KETO).",1350360721

Depending on the relative orbital planes of the planet and the second binary star system, that may occur any time from once per orbital period to once every 10,000 years. But now try to see how the planet stays in a stable orbit over a billion years. At least in the models I've been able to come up with the tidal effect is assymetric, which is to say the tweak to orbit of the planet is not counter acted by a symmetric tweak on the far side. Even starting with the 'suns' being effectively two point sources 1000AU apart in a bilaterally stable orbit. Trying to find a way to reliably orbit a planet around one of them stably is eluding me.
