For desktop applications that the ""average user"" interacts with, Python is even less popular than Java/Swing.  Can you name any popular Windows applications written entirely in Python?<p>The majority of people using Python are using it in ways that aren't going to be replaced by mobile devices any time soon.  Nobody's going to  replace Django running on a server with some other framework running on a mobile device.  Nobody is going to throw away Blender and start doing 3D modeling on their iPhone.  There'd be little point in making a scipy library for Android.<p>Python doesn't have to dominate every single niche on every platform everywhere to be successful.",1349153854

Ok so you don't have thread locks, big deal, but you still have shared data structured that could be updated in a non-deterministic order depending on which file descriptor gets fired first by epoll (or whatever select thingy is being used lately).",1349151140
