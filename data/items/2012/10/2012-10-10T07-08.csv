It is about the properties of linear transformations in general. While matrix multiplication may have simple implementations in spreadsheets, many other concepts in linear algebra <i>don't</i>, for example calculations of and properties of eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues, or the various matrix decompositions (themselves closely related to eigenvalues and eigenvectors). The matrix decompositions in particular give results that not only are mathematically interesting, but are enormously important computationally.<p>In terms of societal impact, other than calculus, no field of mathematics has had a greater impact than linear algebra.
