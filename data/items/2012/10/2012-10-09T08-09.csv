4630598,comment,4629317,4630546,5,0,PakG1,,,"I can appreciate why this comment is so up-voted.  It's easy for us to think in terms of black and white, binary, here are the lines, true and false if statements.<p>But on both points, the analysis is still coming from the same mindset/framework of thinking.<p>On the issue of merit, if you can't communicate about the merit, the merit might as well not exist.  In a case where someone has merit to solve a problem, but not the social skills to properly communicate, the person is very similar to a computer program that can receive input and provide output.  Computers are great at following instructions to the letter, so much that if they do something wrong, it's usually the user's fault.  But how often do we realize now that a program was designed ineffectively so that we now blame the application rather than the user (see any industrial design review), and how often do we wish we could implement machine learning capabilities that would allow the application to correctly guess what the user is really trying to do?  People have the ability to adapt social interactions to the user (call it better AI) and also provide this dyanmic feedback (call it machine learning).  We can rise above the level of dumb computers that receive input, provide output, and then blame the user if the output isn't actually what the user was looking for.<p>On the issue of radical honesty and transparency, and feeling very dishonest and ugly.  I really can appreciate this, I can.  But in learning to be empathetic to others (especially my mother, whose mind operates in a totally different manner than my own, leading to many arguments with her when I was younger and I'll admit more immature), I realize that for them not taking into considerations someone's feelings is equally ugly.  The words I usually hear are ""You don't know anything about my problem, stop acting like you do.""<p>Basically in such interactions, I'm not helping, even if I'm right.  If we want to speak about merit, the true test should not be my level of knowledge, but rather, did I solve the problem?  If I can't solve the problem, how much is my merit really worth?

The rocket will crash, or it will not, period.[1]  Probability, as a measure of your own ignorance, is subjective.[2] Your main point still stands though: knowing about the uncertainty of that lead engineer certainly should influence your assessments of the risks involved.<p>[1] What will actually happen is, the universe splits into many ""worlds"" (blobs of amplitude in configuration space), a fraction of which will have the rocket crash, and the rest won't.

There have been times when I've been pretty adept at recognizing and responding to signals. But over the past few years, I have lapsed.<p>Just as an example: today, at a talk, I was talking to this woman and we had a pleasant conversation. Then, as the talk is about to start, she says something to the effect of ""I'd love to learn more about your work"". My response (with a mouthful of pizza)? ""Sure!"". And then I focused back on the speaker as he was about to start speaking. Much later I realized she wanted to continue the conversation later, and wanted my card or some contact info. But by then she was gone (she left early).<p>So, for me, it's not that I don't pick up signals; I do pick up many, but they have a much lower priority in the brain's CPU and my responses don't incorporate the signals.

They are an afterthought.  I care about sockets and the ability to connect a machine to other machines over a network.<p>I care about code that can boot a computer, code that can be used to write drivers to control hardware (maybe some new hardware that just hits the market), and code that let's us build on top of that.  With this code we should be able to build a kernel and userspace utilities and thereby manage to operate the hardware.  Once everything is up and running, then we can install any scripting language we want.  We don't have to use the same language we used to build the system to do any work after that, but we could.  Indeed many higher level things are written in C, e.g., the interpreters for languages like JavaScript and the web browsers they are a part of.  Maybe there's a reason for that?<p>If the best code for building from the ground up on any given piece of hardware is Javascript, it's news to me.  Any examples?  I have a new piece of hardware.  Can I boot it using JavaScript?  Can I control the hardware with JavaScript?<p>I believe the OP just wanted to do parsing in userspace.

4630514,comment,4629544,4630416,7,0,Stratoscope,,,"That has a couple of problems. Try this:<p><pre><code>  > var hash = [];
  undefined
  > hash
  []
  > hash['length']
  0
  > // Hey! That should have been undefined, not 0!
  > hash['length'] = 'test'
  RangeError: Invalid array length
  > // And I can't set it either!
</code></pre>
Also, the part where you're doing hash[hash] doesn't do at all what you think. When you write this code:<p><pre><code>  hash[hash] = whatever;
</code></pre>
What you're really doing is:<p><pre><code>  hash[ hash.toString() ] = whatever;
</code></pre>
And with hash being an array, hash.toString() is highly browser dependent. In Chrome, if you don't have any numeric array keys, then hash.toString() is """" regardless of your non-numeric keys (at least in the version I'm testing). So you may well be really doing this in Chrome:<p><pre><code>  hash[""""] = whatever;  // Oops
</code></pre>
If you do want to use a native JavaScript type as a hash, the one to use is Object, not Array. Simply change the first line of your test to:<p><pre><code>  var hash = {};
</code></pre>
and go from there.<p>This still doesn't solve the name collisions, but is plenty useful anyway.<p>If you do want a more fool-proof hash that lets you use any string as a key without fear, I'm pretty sure you need to write some code like the Hash class I posted. You still couldn't do the hash[hash] - or hash.get(hash) - because of the dependence on .toString(), but any string key would work. You could even get fancy and give the Hash class some kind of useful .toString() method so you could use hash[hash] - having your own code here opens up those kinds of possibilities.",1349770328

In my opinion, however, there is no comparing/substituting them to traditional stimulants that allow for hours of immediate focus. Take both.
