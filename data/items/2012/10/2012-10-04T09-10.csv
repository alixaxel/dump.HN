Regexes are intimidating at first, but when you get the hang of them they are a fabulously powerful tool that absolutely every programmer should learn.<p>As for 'laziness', I don't buy that regexes take any longer to write than the linked method. The third example can be done (in python, but I'm sure the ruby equivalent is just as simple) with:<p><pre><code>  re.sub(r'from\s+(\w+)\s+(\w+)\s+to\s+(\w+)\s+(\w+)', r""{'from': '\1 \2', 'to':'\3 \4'}"", ""from 4th October  to 10th  October"")

Which is only ten characters longer, requires no external dependencies and can be used with very little modification in (almost) every other language.",1349344761

They were never given big, important or new projects but as a consequence were never expected to burn the midnight oil.<p>The main thing that looks unappealing to me about being a hacker decades from now is the constant cycle of learning. I'm on probably my 3rd generation upheaval. I've worked on a daily basis in a team of programmers with C, C++, C#, Java and Python. Getting familiar enough with those languages to do more than just tinker took a lot of effort - even for the languages that are pretty similar e.g. C# and Java. I'm now looking to do more front to back website coding (away from pure desktop/server stuff) so I'm trying a few things out before choosing on the main stack of technologies I need to master.<p>In my early thirties I still have the enthusiasm to do this but I find it hard to picture doing the same ten years from now with the same smile on my face.",1349342729

I've heard suggestions that it's harder for an author to maintain the integrity of a vision when offering a branching story;  I hope that's false and we'll see a growth in more literary content as authors become more familiar with the form (as has happened with visual novels to some extent).<p>Done right branches can be very immersive, increasing the impact of a story dramatically.

In programming in most cases you are working on projects. Once you deliver the code that project is essentially over (minus support and bug fixing of course). In a management role many of the key activities never really conclude. For example, resource allocation overall and amongst various projects, is something depending on circumstance, you may have to revisit on a weekly or monthly basis.  So you don't get the satisfaction of ""delivering"" anymore and items stay in your inbox much longer. This for me is the key difference.",1349342515
