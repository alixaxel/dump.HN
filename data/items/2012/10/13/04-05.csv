Having a cheeseburger doesn't mean you don't care at all about your health, it means you've decided that the short-term pleasure it gives you is more valuable than the long-term benefits from having a salad instead. And if you're indifferent between the taste of regular and diet Coke, it makes perfect sense to go for the healthier one.<p>The no-sugar-no-burgers-ever crowd is oddly similar to the abstinence-only-sex-ed crowd.

No consultant worth their salt would have allowed SpaceX to handle the secondary mission failure they way they did. They made a series of classic and potentially disastrous mistakes. The best thing they could have done was address the issue head on with what information they had and then filled in further details as they were known.<p>To build credibility you have to admit failure. You can't just omit the bad news while focusing on the good news. You can't allow rumor and speculation to be your spokesperson. There's no way around the fact that an engine failure led to the failure of their secondary mission. Test platform or not, fully insured or not, an expensive piece of hardware became a shooting star. Someone didn't get what they paid for.<p>How it was handled was seriously amateurish. It made me cringe because I really want to see SpaceX (and Musk) succeed.

4647936,comment,4647482,4647482,10,0,kamaal,,,"Comments in this thread make me realize how much developers are ignorant about business matters.<p>Large companies like PayPal have many sub systems, division and units that need to function to even keep the company alive. To give you a small example, say if you are running PayPal- For a company of that scale you can't really plan any thing on the business side unless you measure things, so suddenly you see a requirement for a system which will deal only with metrics and analytics. Once your user base grows out to a large size, suddenly you will find yourself running large data centers, service engineering teams and their operations. You will need dedicated sales teams to tackle those problems, product teams to ensure crap doesn't shipped out. You will need architects who can make a dozen systems work together, you will product managers decide the right technical course for the future. You will need program managers to ensure engineers hit the deadlines. You will need QE teams to break stuff what engineers overlook.<p>Yes you can argue that you may not need all that, but when you do that you will inevitably find somebody or the other in the organization doing those jobs, albeit the scenario will now be a lot more chaotic with no center of ownerships and responsibility.<p>It becomes difficult to move quickly in such places.",1350103832

The current homepage design is arguably more minimalistic and useful than any design from 2000 onwards. Links to other Google services are conveniently located in a bar at the top where they don't get in the way (as opposed to crowding the area around the search box previously). I can click a microphone and speak my query. When I start typing, results start loading instantly. All improvements in my book, and definitely worth it for the broadband world, which is probably a lot of Google's business at this point.

4647923,comment,4647476,4647552,8,0,T-R,,,"I'd maybe argue that ""framework"" is a bit of a misnomer - Opa is a programming language based on ML (it was originally called MLState) where the compiler determines/enforces what runs on the client or server. It originally compiled down to native code on the server via OCaml as well as front-end Javascript, until the more recent switch to using Node.js on the backend. A lot of the security benefits it offers likely come from the type system (with type inference), probably similar to building a site in Haskell (compile-time errors on unclean strings, type-safe URLs, etc.).<p>Along side of this, it includes a slew of libraries and tools for doing things like authentication, interfacing with specific web services, and building websites, which is why it seems they've started to focus on the ""framework"" aspect.",1350103246

(2/4)^3 is the chances of the next launch also having a single engine failure.<p>The chances of a single engine failing in a launch based on these four launches should be 2/36, two engines failed out of 36 fired total.<p>So, assuming that a single engine failure does not increase failure chance of nearby engines (which is not true probably), and assuming past performance is indicator of future performance, and discounting all the test fires that they have done with the rocket, the formula should look more like the following:<p>Chances of any given 3 engines failing is the inverse of the chances of at least two engines failing at the same time.<p>Chances of at least two engines failing equals \nno engines failing + 1 engine failing + 2 engines failing<p>Based on current engine failure rate, that's (17/18)^9 + (1/18)^8 + C(9,2) * (1/18)^2 * (17/18)^7<p>where C(9,2) = 9!/(2! 7!) = 36<p>So that looks more like 98.88% chance of two or fewer engines failing, the converse of which is about 0.02% chance of a triple or more failure.<p>(math is not my strong suit, please correct me if I'm wrong, but #math on IRC thought this looked correct).",1350103057

I really think Apple has to get away from the dependency on Samsung; it needs to partner with a company that doesn't have the potential of taking advantage of Apple's product roadmap.<p>I cannot believe that people don't talk between Samsung's mobile division and their semi-conductor fabrication business (regardless of NDAs). I think being Apple's supplier and themselves being in the business of making phones and tablets, has worked to Samsung's advantage.<p>That being said, I think Samsung is a really powerful company and they'll be able to hold their own (i.e. revenues from product sales etc.) without Apple's business.",1350101972

I can find a link if people are interested, but in his latest book Robert Shiller discusses firms that created some special financial products in the late 90s. The products were effectively betting on black swan events happening at a certain time. They ensured a high annual IRR but then if the event didn't occur their investors were left holding the bag. What made the idea profitable for the firms was that LPs that invested in years 4-6 did so based on IRR, without examining things in detail and effectively overpaid for a piece.",1350101223
