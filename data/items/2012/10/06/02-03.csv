The work flow for something like this is to have multiple shooters each taking ~25GB worth of photos for one shoot. Then they process the worthy photos, making 3 large files per photo (RAW, .psd, and a final .png). During the turnaround time between wedding and delivery, it would be ideal to keep a copy of each of these files somewhere, but at least keeping the RAW somewhere safe is a minimum requirement. We were trying to figure out a feasible backup solution for the volume of data that such a shoot would require. The time to upload this data is longer than the delivery time for the photos, given the current available upstream bandwidth.<p>We came to the conclusion that putting files on BluRay disks or hard drives and keeping them physically separate was the best solution for the cost. The problem is that disks take a long time to burn, and external hard drives aren't the best archival medium (not to mention they don't always travel well).<p>Has anyone here solved the problem of data backups where bandwidth limits make pure online/cloud storage infeasible?",1349490495

The first reasonably strong, narrow-band radio signals commenced in the 1920s. Not even 100 years.

Safety, cleanliness, property rights, collection of taxes, etc.<p>You say ""society does not take kindly to seemingly slight deviations from normal"". I don't think your experiment that summer was a slight deviation. What you did was two standard deviations away from normal.
