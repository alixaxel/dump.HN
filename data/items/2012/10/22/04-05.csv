4681902,comment,4681412,4681412,17,0,bztzt,,,"Ever since Windows 8 was first shown to the public back in June 2011 people have speculated about / been confused about what relation the ""new system"" has to the existing Windows, technically - is ""Metro"" a thin layer over ""Desktop"" Windows, like Media Center or Bob? Or is it the reverse, the desktop some virtual-machine environment on top of the ""new system"", like Mac OS ""classic mode""? Or are they two systems running side-by-side?<p>In fact it's none of those things - the new environment/UI isn't a new shell running on top of, underneath, or alongside the existing shell. Rather, it's a set of new features added and refactorings made to every layer of the existing system, together with a set of <i>policies</i> designed to create the effect of a fresh new environment by encouraging/enforcing a path through only the ""new"" parts of each layer.<p>So, for example, the app permissions / sandbox that new-style apps run in is actually a new general low-level system feature that desktop apps can use too - IE10 desktop uses it for ""Enhanced Protected Mode"". But this isn't really being publicized or promoted because why would desktop app developers rewrite their code to work with it? Similarly the windows that new-style apps run in aren't being controlled by some separate window manager, they are just regular windows (HWND) in the existing window manager - but that window manager has new features for smoother composition/animation and touch manipulation of windows, and new security features to enforce Z-order rules so apps can't pop up windows on top of new-style apps or steal focus or whatever. Most of the new WinRT APIs aren't available to desktop apps but there is no <i>fundamental</i> purely technical reason they can't be. And so on.",1350881567

In the US the recipient essentially pays the extra over a landline and gets a bulk discount for doing so.  In most other countries the caller pays more for making the call to a cell phone.  The price difference can be staggering.<p>Look at this (random) calling card rates page where it gives the price per minute to call from the US to various countries:  <a href=""http://callingcards.com/shopping/qj-phone-card-usa.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://callingcards.com/shopping/qj-phone-card-usa.asp</a><p>Note how much more it usually costs to call cell phones versus land lines, sometimes ten times as much.  Don't forget the rate includes the transit of the call from the US to the country as well so the actual difference can be even greater.<p>It does seem somewhat fairer that the person making the call is hit with the extra charges, but at the same time it is far harder for them to get a bulk discount since the charges come from the recipient's network.<p>All that said the SMS situation is because the US carriers could get away with it.",1350880950

There's some correlation between doing a masters level education course, and English teaching ability, but OLS shows this is just because students with good English ability (high writing scores in high school) are more likely to do a masters level teaching course.<p>> Yes, teaching and learning is not a field that depends on hard facts alone. The 'soft' factors are important as well. Student teachers need some pointers, models, methods, examples of how to deal with the soft factors.<p>For example, they should be learning psychology that's not so outdated that the Cosmopolitan magazine should be embarrassed to write articles on it (Myers-Briggs is totally discredited). I'm not saying I'm a hard reductionist. Education should be based on fundamental psychological foundations if possible, and while that's not always possible they should at least <i>try</i> to either teach stuff which is fundamentally sound, or actually works in the classroom.",1350880942

4681862,comment,4679756,4679756,1,0,carl8,,,"Here's the solution that I came up with prior to following the link or reading any comments.<p>We're given 1 million integers from 0 to 99,999,999.  We only have 1MB of RAM, or an average ~8 bits for each of the million numbers.  So we can't store the numbers directly since they take ~27 bits each.<p>First thought was to use a bitset but that would require 100 million bits, and we only have ~8 million bits RAM, so that's not going to work.  Also need to deal with duplicates.<p>How about this.  Something similar to a selection sort algorithm that stores deltas of distances between sorted numbers.  As a number is streamed in, we start scanning from the beginning of the list until it's correct position found, where it is inserted and then push down the  remaining numbers.  This will be O(n^2).<p>Since the average delta distance between numbers is about 100, we'll use 8-bits to store the delta value.  Value 0 means the number is a duplicate of the current number.  Values 1-254 mean add this number to the current number for the new number.  Value 255 means add 255, then use the next byte as the delta value (repeat until the value != 255).<p>(Case 1)\n1 million ints exactly 100 apart:\n  0, 100, 200, 300, 400, ..., 99999800, 99999900\nStored as a list of 8-bit delta values:\n  0, 100, 100, 100, 100, ..., 100, 100   (1 million bytes total)<p>(Case 2)\n1/2 million zeros, then 1/2 million values of 99999999.\nStored as:\nstart:  0, 0, 0, 0, ... (1/2 million zero deltas)\n then:  255, 255, 255, 255, ... (99999999 / 255 = 392,156 times repeated, which gets us to number 99,999,780)\n then:  219, 0, 0, 0, 0, ... (another 1/2 million zero deltas)<p>So the total amount of storage for Case 2, which I presume is worse case (but correct me if I'm wrong!) is:\n500,000 + 392,156 + 1 + 500,000 = 1,392,157 bytes to store the delta values.<p>1MB = 1,048,576 bytes, so I'm over by 343,581 bytes... (so close!)<p>We'll have to modify this scheme so that we reduce the number of 255 values, which should not be hard to do and will get us under the 1MB size limit.  Or we could try something fancier like huffman coding to reduce the size of the delta values.",1350880365

Most of the non-fratboy pads I have seen that are truly depressing are an inflatable mattress/pile of yogamats/camping mattress on the floor and a pile of books (sometimes a laptop). I've been in 4 bedroom houses which other than a thin layer of dust had nothing but the mentioned items in them. Some view their lifestyle as minimalist, others just don't see the need for owning anything. 'I don't need a fridge because I don't cook', 'the washing lady comes once a week, so I don't need a washing machine', 'I've never opened that cupboard'. Those sort of statements are signs that you need to help your friends get some serious help. If someone can't come round to your house because of your 'minimalist' lifestyle that is a serious problem. Humans are social creatures, if you can't socialise something is wrong.<p>That sort of lifestyle is just as damaged as the sort that compels people to store every pizza box and newspaper in the corner and prevents them from throwing anything away.",1350879896

When changing it to `raw`, the user is redirected to the `raw.github.com` subdomain. `blob` is the normal view, and `commits` is a history of the file.<p>Note that using the `edit` version will instantly create a fork in your account for that repo.

The reason costs are skyrocketing is that you have a privatized system that's (oddly) subsidized by the government. Patent laws give pharmaceutical companies monopolies on different types of drugs, while on the other hand the government is forbidden to negotiate with those companies on the price.<p>You also have huge overhead (31%) due to the inherent inefficiencies of running this kind of system through the private sector. For example, you need at least two doctors for each transaction - one to diagnose you and prescribe treatment and one working for the insurance company making sure that you actually <i>need</i> that treatment.<p>As for the argument about demand reduction, I agree that if you had much more demand, even reduced costs may make it unsustainable.
