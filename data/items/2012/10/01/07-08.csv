4595804,comment,4593902,4595074,4,0,jadyoyster,,,"Motorbike helmets are in no way comparable to bicycle helmets. Bicycle helmets have to be very light due to the physical activity exerted by their wearers.<p>Another thing you'll rarely hear bicycle advocates say is that cycling on the pavement is safer. It most definitely is not, due to the speed difference between pedestrians and cyclists. This is not only dangerous to pedestrians: drivers aren't used to checking for fast moving objects on the pavement. Worse, pavements are rarely constructed with good vehicle visibility in mind. It's also hard to figure out which rules apply (pedestrian or road?), unlike when everyone is sharing the lane.",1349078099

Arriving more than a minute late is unusual (less than that is hard to judge because the timetables don't include seconds).<p>The only real exceptions are situations where it's almost impossible to do bettercleaning up after a suicide (and here they're still many times faster than in the U.S., for instance), or operating in inclement weather so severe that attempting normal operation would be dangerous.<p>These exceptions do happen often enough that anybody who lives in Japan will be inconvenienced occasionally (with suicides being the main offender), but 99% of the time, you can set your watch by train arrivals.<p>More to the point, there seems little they could do to make punctuality much better, unless they can figure out how to cheer up the population to the point of discouraging suicides (and of course they are actually working on this issue by moving to platform doors on some lines, not to mention more wacky methods like the blue lights underneath the ends of platforms).<p>If something is so good that there's little practical room for any improvement, doesn't that make it a pretty good candidate for being called ""a paragon""?",1349078030

I think ""the framework"" concept is wrong now, everyone should think in modular manner, both framework users and creators, because it allows to build really decent software. Rock solid frameworks are full of lie, slow and monsterous. So, my goal in railway - keep it modular and thin. After 1.5 years Railway is not Rails-like :) It just follows best part of it's ideology. But every new stuff I'm planning to add to framework will be added as modules.<p>For example now I'm working on ""RIO"" (railwayjs + socket.io) module, which will unobtrousively add socket.io capabilities to framework. It also solves auth and user-to-user communication problems.<p>Another big way to go - client side. We have some information about application structure that could be used in client-side, and duplication through backbone on client-side is awful idea, why not just give and transarent API for it. And this is separate module too, not bundled in railway.<p>So, this is a biggest difference in my opinion, anything other we implementing are basically the same.",1349076966

I left node for Scala because the advertised code sharing wasn't worth having to work around an event architecture that I found hard to debug (as I've mentioned elsewhere) and  I too considered Erlang before settling on Scala due to our previous java experience and my co-founder's knowledge of people in the Scala community.<p>But fundamentally, node.js isn't interesting if it's not in Javascript. Actors seem like a better model than futures tacked on to callbacks, and frankly javascript's quirks (like having to use require.js for modularization rather than a feature built into the language!) IMHO don't make for a compelling case.<p>I'd use node.js on someone else's project, but I don't know if I'd pick it for my own.",1349076902
4595770,comment,4595409,4595409,4,0,rachelbythebay,,,"Is every search engine focused on building the same system?  You have a bunch of crawlers, and then you build up some way to store all of this stuff and index it, and then make some way to search it and serve an interface to it.  Am I right so far?<p>This is how web search has worked for a long time: make a copy of as much of the web as you can, and then search <i>that</i>.  This means a lot of missed content, inconsistent results, and so much duplication it's not funny.  How many disk farms are out there solely to try to hold copies of the entire web?  How many RAM farms for the ""hot"" n%?<p>I came up with an idea for inverting web search.  Instead of searching the copies, search the actual sites with the content.  But... instead of having to find all of them to send them your searches, have them find you.  It's like a stock exchange for searching.  I register a query, they pull from the firehose, and they can provide their best match for it.  Then it finds its way back to me.  It would probably cache old results to make response times reasonable, and so that the sources wouldn't have to consume the full firehose.<p>That's the basic idea, and it goes from there.<p>I wrote about this in April: <a href=""http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2012/04/30/search/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2012/04/30/search/</a>",1349076856

This is really the saddest piece I've read in a while (meatspace news included).<p>The author has some very misguided assumptions beyond the fallacy of the general idea:<p>1. Apple is not the only game in town: Android is gaining market share (and not just on the low end devices, either), Jelly Bean is fantastic. Nexus 7 has converted few loyal Apple fans around me already.<p>2. Apple needs an appealing device to get the masses to buy new phones: they can't pull another 4S. Has to have a significant enough change to get the sales they are after (and frankly, expected to deliver). The 5 is a very good compromise between not alienating existing iPhone users and catering to the owners of the 4S.<p>3. The screen size of the iPhone was no longer competitive. The market clearly wants larger displays and there's only so much that people are willing to overlook to remain with their favorite ecosystem.<p>Apple won consumers by radical innovation, disruption in its fullest sense. Apple has proved that you don't make middle of the road products to appeal to all users, but rather that you can actively reeducate the general population using wonderful products.<p>Just 5 years ago, an iPhone-like device would have been considered an overly technological and complicated relic with usage far removed from anything in the market, and here it is used by elders. This is not because Apple (well, Steve) aimed at what the general population wanted, but because they gave users something exciting and useful, and <i>everyone</i> embraced it.<p>This quote is usually attributed to Henry Ford - ""If Id asked people what they wanted, they would have asked for a better horse""\nApple shouldn't be giving us better horses, or locomotives or even cars.

This philosophy is widely held outside of PUA culture, and I hate it everywhere, but PUA culture seems to really put this idea into overdrive.<p>What is glossed over by the PUA community, is that the practice leaves a wake of doing things to women over and over that they don't want. It's written off, like ""you win some you lose some!"" but you just made someone's day a little worse, and caused the general animosity between men and women to be turned up a notch. The reason a man can't just say hello to a woman and have it just be a friendly hello is because of PUAs and others who follow this principle.<p>Women walk around totally shell shocked because of the constant ""numbers game"" onslaught of men who are trying to ""pick them up"" and I personally think it needs to stop.

Since completed models can be readily shared amongst those who use 3d printers, I think it's safe to say that a lack of competent 3d modelers won't be a limiting factor for the growth of 3d printing.

I don't even know if this is really true.<p>Everytime I think of a new feature I fastly have an API in mind. Starting with a test almost always shows me a better way to provide the functionality (easier, more failsafe). Thats one of my two key features of TDD.<p>The second key feature is that the tests you write are much more expressive than tests you write afterwards. I observe that everyday in my team and company. Writing tests after the implementation is done leads to a lot of mocks and just a static verification that the implementation works how it works. In the end, it is difficult to change the implementation and easy to break the specification. Writing your test ahead of the implementation means you test the specification and not how you implemented it. Tests become much easier to read as they express the specification instead of a 1000 lines test where every variable assignment of the implementation is checked.<p>As a last hint: I read here that people complain that TDD does not work with ""prototyping"". I agree with that - the problem with that statement is that a lot of people use their prototype as productive code later on instead of rebuilding it after the experimental phase. In my opinion that is a misuse of the word ""prototype"". A prototype is an experimental work to verify or learn some ideas and afterwards designing a better system.\nOther people may state that testing everything is not possible - that there are situations where it is not possible to write a test. I would bet that in 90% of that cases, this is just wrong and means a lack of testing experience of the writer. I can really recommend the following book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Driven-Development-Embedded-Pragmatic-Programmers/dp/193435662X/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Driven-Development-Embedded-Pragmatic-...</a> I rarly do embedded system programming.
