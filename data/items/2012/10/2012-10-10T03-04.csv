I recall when Facebook Connect was first introduced, it provided websites the ability to let non-logged-in users to login to Facebook via an inline iframe. (the experience is pretty much same as Stripe's button's approach). Facebook disabled it shortly after for the reason that I think it's pretty obvious: one can easily create an iframe login form that pretends to be from Facebook and use it to phish login credentials. Instead of using iframe, Facebook now popups a window to prompt user for login credential and app authorization. I believe it will only be a matter of time before Stripe abandon this inlined approach and switch to a popup-based solution; otherwise, they will likely jeopardize their brand/trust when malicious people start to spoof their payment flow.",1349841353

4634973,comment,4634062,4634062,1,0,randomfool,,,"I did not start my career at Microsoft, but I worked there for quite a while, alongside many who did. As far as I am concerned, the primary upshot of working there is that it's decent resume material. But beware- after 5 years of being there, it starts being a resume killer. Seattle companies are wary of developers too indoctrinated in Microsoft's ways. I would not recommend staying there for more than 3 years.<p>Furthermore, I am very (very) thankful that I did not start my career at Microsoft, but rather at small startups. The primary drawbacks I see for starting at Microsoft are:<p>* You do not really learn from your mistakes- there are sooo many code reviews, design reviews, test reviews, etc that it's essentially waterfall planning and you have very little chance to experiment and fail. Which I think is critical for starting out. You're surrounded by very experienced people, but at first what you really need to do is to learn on your own (in a production environment).<p>* There is a certain lack of energy on many teams at Microsoft (not all, but a large majority). You're young, you have nothing to lose, may as well learn what it feels like to work on a small team and crank out features like your company is going to go bankrupt in 3 months.<p>* At Microsoft, you learn to code. At smaller companies, you learn everything. A bit of customer support, business models, ux design, etc. A small company gives you a great broad base of experience from which you can build on in any direction. Microsoft for the most part, is more of a specialist (one person who just works on installers, one person just working on build system, etc).",1349841307

To me, that's pretty much as good as knowing the algorithm's run time off hand.  Maybe even better.

Even though probably foolish to expect that the Javascript creator would offer non-Javascript solutions, I would guess that it would be significantly better to compile Javascript/CSS to a more efficient, stable, portable target byte code or source language (Go? Scheme? Postscript?) than to compile languages to Javascript.  For example, when I played with it the Hello World ClojureScript example compiled to a Javascript file of over 100kbytes.  It seems like Go and JIT'ed languages have demonstrated that extremely fast compilation of extremely efficient high level native code is possible.<p>Long-term it seems like it would be significantly better to encode these web language extensions (new CSS/Javascript syntax) as libraries instead of as API/run-time extensions so that each new version of web languages doesn't require all the run-times (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, IE) to adopt it and old run-times to phase out.

This description, along with my impression of how people with the condition function in life, brings to my mind an image of people who are socially-blind, unable to avoid constantly tripping, stumbling and smashing into the obstacles of social terrain around them.<p>While I support the move to view Asperger's more as a different way of being human rather than a defect per se, this does not to me sound like the making of a new master race. If Zynga was the result of a Asperger's conspiracy to hijack the frivolous satisfaction pathways of ""neurotypicals"" and so take over the world, I might think differently. But it's not. People with Asperger's don't seem to be interested in conquering the neurotypical world, they seem to be happiest staying at home playing with computers and avoiding other people.<p>Basically, my impression of Asperger's sufferers is that they lack the social insight and intuition to succeed in the real world. They do okay in carefully-constructed bubbles with interesting non-human toys and machines to play with. But they can't cope with normal human beings.<p>Additionally, your characterisation of normal human beings as too dumb and clueless to resist mindless games is... rather crude I think.
