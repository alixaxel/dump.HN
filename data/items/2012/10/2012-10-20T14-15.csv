4677204,comment,4675857,4676580,7,0,hluska,,,"Mind if I jump in with an analogy?<p>In 2012, the Canadian Olympic team sent 281 athletes to compete at the summer Olympics in London. The World Bank reports that Canada's population is approximately 34,000,000.<p>Using a raw analysis, you could say that, ""A Canadian has a 281/34,000,000 probability of reaching the summer Olympics.""
That is perfectly valid.<p>However, you cannot use that same technique to judge individual chances of success. Let's say that I am in a room with Brent Hayden.<p>Brent Hayden (a swimmer who won a bronze medal) is 6'4 and has a very athletic build. I am 25 pounds overweight, pasty faced from too much time in front of computers and completely void of hand-eye coordination.<p>Clearly, our individual odds of reaching the Olympics are different. The probability that I will make the summer Olympics is, in actuality, far below 281/34M because I am on the left side of the athletic prowess bell curve. Someone like Brent Hayden's probability of making the summer Olympics in, in actuality, higher than 281/34M because they would fall on the right side of the athletic prowess bell curve.<p>Those sorts of normal distributions happen in startups as well. Some teams are significantly more suited for the demands of startup lives (just like some couples are significantly better suited for the demands of marriage than others are).",1350745122

They assume that money comes along with that...""<p>Half of your statement is true, most if not all young musicians want to be famous (and by that I mean have lots of people listen to their music and see them play). I don't think the second part is completely true though. Most musicians do what they do because they love it and as long as they can make enough money to buy them food, a bed, and get them to the next show, they will be satisfied. People are familiar with the bad reputation labels have and are aware it is not always a road to riches. I think there are very few people who get into music for the money, frankly because the chances of you making a lot of money in it are unlikely.

In my case it was measured in days with weekends in between.<p>Overall, I've only worked at a few 'big' companies (more than 20 people) and was continually frustrated when requests of mine were framed as 'coming from a tech' or 'you don't understand business', which these sorts of requests tended to fall under.<p>In a nutshell, someone else got to choose tech XYZ, but didn't have to work with it.   The people charged with using it are not given any authority to actually contact the vendor to fix the problem (or, in some cases, buy proper training or even get reimbursed for books on the subject).  And somehow this is ""good business""?<p>Few other departments in a large company would put up with this BS.

You pay the same costs but they get some cut of the money for providing service.  I think this is the model Google wants to implement, have another company handle simple support and they can handle real issues when contacted by the company, not the end users.  I think this actually happened for us, but it is invisible.  We had an issue with Mac mail and google apps when we started.  It wasn't behaving properly.  We contacted our provider who I think contacted google and an engineer actually looked at the logs and explained it as a bug in Mac mail which after a timeout was initiating more connections and flooding the server.<p>Anyway I think google apps providers probably can provide sufficient support, maybe google voice just needs to get there.",1350744579

4677172,comment,4677052,4677052,1,0,gvb,,,"a) We don't actually know that it worked for GE.  There were a lot of changes under Welch, so there were a lot of simultaneously changing variables.  I would contend that the ""10%"" policy had smaller potential than lot of the other changes.  Note that one of the changes was changing from a company that was primarily an ""old guard"" manufacturing business to one whose net income is nearly 50% from its financial subsidiary (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Capital"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Capital</a>) - before the recession, it was substantially more than 50%.  That is a huge change.<p>b) GE under Welch was an old, established, stagnant company.  My personal theory (pure speculation) is that GE had built up a lot of inefficient processes: whenever something bad happens, regardless of the probability of it recurring, the natural response of (especially large) corporations is to write another procedure to prevent it from recurring.  GE also likely accreated lots of ineffective employees over the years (to write and follow the ineffective processes ;-).<p>As a result, GE under Welch was able to cut a <i>lot</i> of costs out of their manufacturing processes by re-evaluating the cost vs. effectiveness vs. benefits of them.  All those cut costs would flow to their bottom line, at least for a while.<p>Note that GE's stock has been pretty flat (struggling, even) for the last several years.  According to my speculation above, this would be because they squeezed all the excess costs out of their manufacturing and their financial division took it on the chin with the downturn, leaving them sucking wind.  So...<p>c) Jack Welch's changes happened in a different era and were in response to a different situation.  A solution that works for a totally different company than Microsoft in a totally different era isn't likely to be effective when applied blindly to e.g. Microsoft.",1350744240

No Amazon/Kindle, iBookstore, etc.</i><p>If your goal is to spread it as much as possible than you've got to use any possible option.<p><i>Rule #4: Publish as a PDF. Optionally also as EPUB, depending on topic/audience. No dead-tree version, please.</i><p>To sale thousands of copies you should try to offer a diversity of formats.
