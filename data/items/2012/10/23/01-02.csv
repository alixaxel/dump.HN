If anything, the Chileans, in a rare show of Latin American maturity, have usually assumed full responsibility for the failure of their own political system. Has this changed recently?<p>As for the US ""intervening,"" what post-1970 interventions can you specifically cite that you think brought about the coup? Remember that Allende nationalized the assets of foreign companies, and foreign investors subsequently pulled out of Chile. Remember also that Allende was denounced by the Chilean Supreme Court and Congress, and that he was ultimately overthrown by his own military, and that despite the constant assertions of him having been ""democratically elected,"" he only won 36% of the vote, less than Bush in 2000 (47%), but acted as if his plurality victory gave him some sort of political mandate to transform Chile into a communist country in six years.",1350957382

4686412,comment,4682392,4685608,7,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"I am, at least to some degree. My back-of-the-envelope calculations a while ago suggested that ebooks <i>are</i> cheaper to produce than paper books, just by not as much as people probably imagine. (My figure then was 25% less, although I confess I don't remember how I came up with that now. It may have been a cocktail napkin.)<p>There are certain fixed costs which remain the same no matter the format: you have to (or at least should!) pay the authors, editors, proofreaders, artists, and cover designers the same amount no matter the form because they're doing pretty much the same work. And while ebooks don't have typesetting/layout processes <i>identical</i> to physical books, they still have them. And if you don't want the ebooks to look like ass -- something that a lot of big publishers clearly don't care about yet, unfortunately -- it's not going to take all that much less time, particularly if you have to prepare them in multiple formats; you have to do a ""final proof,"" ideally on the actual devices you're targeting.<p>In practice, all of the costs above are generally much more of the production cost than the actual printing is. The biggest savings you have with an ebook isn't from not paying the printer, it's from not paying the distributor. But there's still a catch there: while you're not giving 50% or more of the cover price to the distributor the way you would if you were trying to get the book into Barnes & Noble or what have you, you're still giving 30% or more of the cover price to the retailer. (And you have to pay attention to the ""or more""; you may be paying a middleman like Lulu to get you into some of the online stores, or you may be paying Amazon's bogus ""download charges"" in addition to their stated 30% cut. Assuming your sale qualifies for their 30% cut bracket, rather than one of the higher ones.)",1350956865

Professional licenses are more expensive than that.<p>2) The runtime can take a long time to load. 3-5 seconds for some apps. You can create a splash screen to mitigate this, but it's a <i></i>*t experience when you do an a/b comparison on a native app and a mono app (this time is basically while it loads the runtime).<p>3) 3rd party library support sucks. It just doesn't really exist; if you're used to pulling nunit, ninject, shouldly, nhibernate, nsubstitute, etc. into your project, forget it. A handful of libraries have been ported to the touch and android runtimes, but most of things you'll look at either won't work or you'll have to recompile manually (to be fair there are a fair few that are easy drop ins; Dapper works like a charm for example).<p>That said, you get some pretty cool stuff: you can separate your core application logic, including database access into its own library and share the code between your various projects.

That's an interesting claim. Do we have strong evidence from before-and-after policy comparisons in other countries that use of marijuana declines if use of marijuana is responded to by administrative sanctions rather than criminal penalties? If so, that would be food for thought for people like me (a generation older than most HN participants) who have seen a lot of promising young people in two generations ""burn out"" from marijuana use. Criminal approaches to social problems are harsh and expensive. If they are also less effective in dealing with reducing marijuana use than administrative approaches, and voters can be convinced of that, perhaps there is a path forward toward reforming marijuana laws on the basis that marijuana should be neither casually used nor a ground for imprisonment. (I think the actual enforcement practice in my state, Minnesota, largely is of the form of diverting users of marijuana to drug treatment programs.)",1350955025

Tests group together various things which may be handled by different subsystems in the brain. If there is something called IQ, it's an aggregate.<p>Anyway, if there was such a unique quantity, actual data shows a progression of IQ scores in time - therefore if the tests are considered accurate and unbiased, it must be a ""quantity"" that can evolve based on the society a person lives it. It should then be considered not as a value, but as a function depending on a variable called society.<p>I do not know if studies have tried to measure the accuracy of repetitive measurement in low education adults enrolled in a learning program. If there are such studies and if they show inconsistent result (ie any change of IQ), then IQ should be considered as a function of 2 variables : f(society, personal experience).<p>Now, even if we consider that at a time t it could be accurately measured and that societal bias could be removed, considering how other qualities (such as determination, work ethic, consistency, creativity, competitiveness...) influence the outcome of any human activity, it seems foolish to rank people based on just one quality - especially if we don't know the other values, and their individual ponderation in the end result.<p>This ponderation could also be different depending on the activity, and IQ provide an absolute advantage in some activities (rhetoric?), but say determination would give an absolute advantage in other activities (startups?).</i>",1350954869
