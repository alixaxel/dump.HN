I'm thinking it can probably be traced back to the financial blockade against Wikileaks and the response thereto.

First of all I don't want to mix personal and work stuff.  Secondly dropbox penalises you.  For example if two users each separately pay dropbox for a 100GB account and then user 1 shares 25GB of content with user 2, dropbox will subtract 25GB from user 2's allowance.  ie what you pay for is the total amount of data you can access, not the amount of unique data.",1351492204

4711312,comment,4706323,4708742,1,0,goggles99,,,"thanks for the reply - Your videos were annoying. You clearly had already isolated problems you were having and played a drama of whining, moaning, fake surprise reaction, per-meditated build of growing frustration as you failed at things repeatedly, it was a bad script and clearly not a fair shake for the tablet. You were trying to convince the viewer to sympathize with you and thus not buy this tablet.<p>A good reviewer does not seethe drama all over - he states the good and bad points without being overly dramatic or going over long poorly written scripts. He does not write a review in the midst of being pissed off. This explains your emotional outbursts and bias/drama in the review and vids - but does not do service to your credibility.<p>I felt like I was watching an election video when I watched your YouTube vids. Just a one sided mud sling. I was embarrassed for you just watching them.<p>I understand being frustrated but 24 hours? You need to learn a little patience. When I started using IOS and OS X (for iPhone Dev) I hated it for weeks. I had all sorts of issues. After learning the ins and outs though, I generally have mostly favorable things to say about it.<p>I don't know about the camera thing. How tall is your desk? I am 6' but I know the average person is something like 5' 9-10"". Strange that I have not had or heard much on this issue for others.<p>I don't understand your issue with updating Word - It is a simple update.<p>I don't know why you reboot your tablet on flights? I fly a lot too but why would a flight mandate that you power off your tablet? Please explain your logic here.<p>For the Mail Setup and SkyDrive problem I can only guess because again, I have not had nor heard of others having the problems.<p>I just feel like for whatever reason you had a bad experience and wrote a seething review in the heat of your frustration. I think that if you had my (or many others) experiences, your review would be much different. I don't know why your experience differed so much from mine and others - either you got a lemon, messed up the tablet somehow, or are a troll. IMO, your emotion/dramatics would suggest the latter.",1351491971

Nena's accent could be seen as endearing, but at the same time, it sounds a tad stilted, and nowhere near as fluid as the original German. It's a dance tune, and once you know what the song is about, it's just much more fun to hear it in the language that sounds more polished and lets you tune out the words so you can, well, dance.<p>At the end of the day, lyrics are a much smaller part of the musical experience than people give them credit for.<p>Then again, I have a very easy time dissociating lyrics (and their meaning) from the rest of the music, so maybe that's just me. This doesn't always happen, but it's not unusual for me to listen to a song enough times to internalize the syllables and sing along, and still not stop and think about what the words actually mean (even in English). It may sound odd at first, but when you think about it, you probably have the same experience when you go to the opera - try and make out the words of Handel's ""The Messiah"", an English opera, and you'll see what I mean[1]!<p>(And now that I think about it, how many people know what the verses of 'Born in the USA' are <i>really</i> about?)<p>Also, I did already know that the German version was more popular, so it's hard to be sure I'm not just rationalizing that knowledge after-the-fact! :-)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5jeelU1Vb4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5jeelU1Vb4</a>",1351490619

I've had a bulging disc in my lower back, L5, for damn near a <i>decade</i> and on many days, it's just about all I can think of. I plan my days around my back pain. I make life choices around my back pain. I want it to go away, very very badly.<p>So, on a scale of 1-10 in terms of ""just how painful is it"", where 10/10 = you just severed your femur, I'd rate my back pain a 6/10. I'd rate my inability to find a local venue for an indie flick a 1/10. In other words, my inability to see indie flicks at cool bars around town doesn't even register with my psyche.<p>It turns out that lots of people have back pain. If I had to guess, probably more people have back pain than want to find a local venue to see indie flicks. I'd rate the back pain market size a 7/10.
