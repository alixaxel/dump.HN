4643767,comment,4643611,4643749,6,0,kevingadd,,,"Detecting types (in the way an engine like V8 or SpiderMonkey does it) is not completely solved by type annotations. Combine that with the fact that annotations could end up being wrong, and what you'd really need here is a language with something approaching static types where the compiler can accurately infer types for most locations without you giving it any help.<p>The 'add' function in the linked article is one example where type annotations would be useless without more sophisticated underlying machinery: The function is intentionally generic and accepts multiple input types, and this results in degraded performance for generated code. Adding type annotations wouldn't fix this; you'd need a more sophisticated type system such that individual function signatures have individual types and it's possible to do dispatch by matching the available signatures for a function being called against the arguments provided (essentially, runtime dispatch for overloaded functions).<p>Another example (not really covered in the linked article) is the way function calls end up working in V8 (and to a lesser degree, SpiderMonkey). To generalize a bit, when you go 'x.foo(y)', a bunch of steps have to occur:<p>The engine has to identify the type of the expression 'x'<p>The engine has to identify the type of 'x.foo'<p>The engine has to identify the type of 'y'<p>Based on those three types it is possible for the engine to figure out whether it has already generated usable assembly for the function being called. (the type checks against argument types may occur within the body of the called function, but that's more of a minor detail here.) More importantly, when I say 'type' here, I mean the complete identity of each expression involved - in a language like C# or C++, I could define foo like this:<p>void X_Foo (X * this, Y & y);<p>And then represent the function call with:<p>X_Foo(x, y);<p>The problem is that X* and Y& are not actually complete descriptions of the values being passed in. If you have derived classes from X, X* is only a partial description of the type being used and doesn't tell you anything about the body of the functions that might be called through that interface. Likewise, X or Y could both contain dynamically typed values and the type of the containing class does nothing to tell you the type of the values.<p>This is the kind of analysis a JavaScript engine has to do - it needs to be able to distinguish between an array containing two floats, an array containing two integers, a Vector2 containing two floats, and a Vector2 containing two integers. Hidden Classes (and SpiderMonkey's equivalent, Shapes) are a way of tracking some of this finer-level detail on the fly and making it accessible to optimize things at runtime.<p>As a thought exercise, given what I describe above (even if it's only partially accurate), what do you think has to happen if you write 'x.call(y, z)' in JavaScript (if x is a Function)? Figuring out the steps actually involved might be surprising!",1350013853

Clearly, ""just"" locking up the entire OEM market is not enough to Achieve Results.  Hence, the signed-driver certification programs we're seeing in recent years, although I have no idea how effective they are.<p>Apple does a crapload of work to make sure that the one, tiny blessed subset of integrated hardware they select every so often works well during the span of its useful life.  Sure, they lean on driver authors of suppliers pretty hard, something which few can do, but they are not nearly as hands-off as Microsoft: the buck stops with them, and a bad integration is Their Fault.  And, on the flip side, if you are not an Apple supplier you don't give even two bits about supporting their operating system, for obvious reasons.<p>If there was a Dell distro and it Did Not Suck, I'd seriously consider it.

Online content should be so much more valuable than broadcast content, both to consumers and advertisers.  And yet, online is still the red-headed stepchild.<p>Online content can target ads <i>individually</i>!  I've filled out the survey on Hulu, they know that I'm a guy, my age, etc.  They probably have pretty good guesses about my income and my interests.  The full set of shows that I watch paints a pretty detailed picture of who I am and what I like.  In an ideal world, they could use that information to show me very precisely targeted ads.<p>That famous quote, ""Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don't know which half."" is probably mostly right, except I'd bet that it's a lot more than half that gets wasted.  And Hulu should have the ability to fix that, by individually targeting ads!  But they're still showing me, a fairly nerdy guy, lots of Febreze ads and Glade sense & spray ads and even the occasional tampon ad or whatever.<p>Google is proof that precisely targeted ads are really, really valuable.  And I think targeting ads well even makes them less annoying; if you're showing me something that's actually relevant to me, I feel less like my time is being wasted.

4643718,comment,4643010,4643202,2,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Haha I do have a keyboard for it. I haven't been satisfied with it - both with the keyboard itself (a Belkin model which suffers from lag and a clunky and heavy velcro-attachment slipcase system) and with the lack of integration with the OS.<p>Specifically, the keyboard is okay for typing text into a single text-box, but little else. You cannot navigate the OS with the keyboard - for example if you press the return to Springboard button (in the function row) you then have to swipe through the app trays and select an app with your fingers. In apps the situation is little better - in the Facebook app, for instance, you can't send a message by pressing Return, you have to touch the Send key.<p>Simply put, keyboard support in iOS is clearly a distant afterthought. Maybe with one of Logitech's nicer keyboard/case solutions, you could use it okay to fire off an email. But it's never going to be a machine you would want to do any sort of real work on. I like browsing the web, but as soon as I want to do any typing, forget it, I'm better off going back to my desktop. With W8 Microsoft appears to have put keyboard integration at the heart of the OS from day one - an attitude which hopefully trickles down to individual app developers. Not only that, but mouse and trackpad support is also fully baked-in (not to mention stylus support). And Microsoft seems to have a much superior focus on actual ergonoics and usability - eg their variable thumb keyboard sizing (try typing on an ipad with the thumb keyboard in the horizontal orientation - then try it with a case or smart case on for extra pain).<p>If Acer's Iconia w510 had stylus support for instance, I think you would have a device with class-beating flexibility, portability and productivity.

The first interpretation (simplicity is a goal in itself) is essentially correct, but is at heart a preference for more comprehensible models. The second interpretation (simplicity leads to greater accuracy) is much more problematic. A critical review of the theoretical arguments\nfor and against it shows that it is unfounded as a universal principle, and demonstrably false. A review of empirical evidence shows that it also fails as a practical heuristic.""<p><a href=""http://reference.kfupm.edu.sa/content/r/o/the_role_of_occam___s_razor_in_knowledge_100134.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reference.kfupm.edu.sa/content/r/o/the_role_of_occam_...</a>",1350011571
