Specially when it looks you are just starting.<p>I run a credit card company on AWS, our website runs on a single, small aws instance, but the POS/Financial servers are setup this way:<p>- 8 multi-az oracle rds instances, 4 of them are slaves. It means we have 16 servers where 8 are manually standing by and 8 are on rds multi-az system. The 4 slaves are set to be used to recover from a data tampering event, not aws outages.<p>- Some dozens of app servers on the same region of each database. We use a custom tcp/ip server I built in java almost a decade ago. We are thinking about migrating to apache Mina.<p>My personal tips:<p>- Why are you paying the heroku premium? Build you own aws servers, put nginx and set cheap instances behind it. Let capistrano be your heroku.<p>- Use some dynamic dns service, I would recommend dynect. Avoid amazon Route 53.<p>- Use multi-az, set up the same database in another region (continent)<p>- Get out of us-east<p>Build the very same setting into another region, create scripts to load the slave country's database if possible.<p>If your database is too fancy or large:<p>Shard or distribute.<p>(Edit) Almost forgot: ALWAYS have fresh as possible, offline backups of everything.

4678638,comment,4678363,4678363,1,0,tomlu,,,"I've recently had the pleasure of purchasing the 30"" matte Dell U3011 IPS and the 27"" semi-glossy Samsung S27B970 PLS.<p>There are pros and cons to both. The anti-glare coating on the Dell makes black text on white background look absolutely rubbish, fuzzy and hard to read. You can sort of get used to it, but every time you switch back from using the semi-glossy Macbook it looks terrible. Black themes don't suffer from these problems nearly as much.<p>With the Samsung, colours look <i>much</i> more vibrant and text is sharper. Reflections are very much an issue, especially with black themes. In very bright conditions with visible light sources the screen becomes almost unusable.<p>Overall, if I could control my lighting, I would go with semi-glossy. Otherwise I would suffer the Dell's anti-glare.<p>I find that both fuzzy text and reflections lead to eye strain and headaches. If they could tone down the anti-glare strength (but still leave <i>some</i> AG coating) I would probably go for that in all circumstances.<p>On an unrelated note, I do prefer the 30"" pixel pitch (.25 mm) to the 27"" (.23 mm). At the given viewing distance the .25mm pixel pitch more closely matches my Macbook's, meaning you can use the same font sizes for both.",1350784007

I've been wondering for some time why Apple hasn't been using using AR coatings on their glossy screens.  These coatings used to be standard on high-end CRT monitors.<p>Anyway, I'm glad to see Apple coming around on this.  Interesting, too, that they don't seem to be talking about it at all.  Maybe they're worried that advertising some of their screens as AR-coated will draw attention to the fact that others, such as their 27"" Thunderbolt monitor, are not.

4678613,comment,4678223,4678595,60,0,alexqgb,,,"The analogy highlights the rhetorical technique of abstracting something to such a degree that opposition seems unreasonable. It's like saying ""I was arrested just for being myself!"" when in fact you were arrested for flashing people on the bus. As an approach, this kind of extreme reframing is both abusive and dishonest.<p>When @ntumlin says ""it's just a bunch of ones and zeroes"" he completely disregards the intangible but very valuable order existing within them. Smash a glass to smithereens, but keep every one, and you still have ""a bunch of atoms"". Their arrangement, however, is very different - and far less valuable. Focusing only on the atoms to evade responsibility for the value lost in smashing the glass suggests you don't recognize the value of the unbroken glass, which is nonsense. Of course you recognize the value, which is why framing the situation to suggest otherwise is dishonest. And expecting others to go along with an obvious charade is abusive.<p>Beyond your dishonesty, @ntumlin, there's also real harm in your actions (assuming they reflect your thinking). The thing you have failed to acknowledge is that that, when you make a copy, you create an obligation to pay the holder of the copyright a specific amount of money. In other words, when you make a copy a portion of your money stopped being yours and became the author's. He now has a claim (albeit a small one) on your wealth. In the event of a failure to pay, the thing stolen is not the file itself, it's the money. THAT'S what you're stealing. Not the music, the money.<p>""Ok"" you say ""but I deleted the file"". That's irrelevant. You're legal obligation isn't connected to having the file, it's connected to making it. Obviously, there are fair use laws that specify a range of situations in which making a copy doesn't trigger a corresponding obligation to pay. But if you're operating outside those parameters, then you're on the hook.<p>There's no scarcity of files. But there's a real scarcity of people with the time, talent, and resources to make really worthwhile content. And it's the arrangements - not the bits - is what constitutes our culture. At present, there's no reasonable way to enforce people's obligations to share the cost of what they otherwise ""share"" freely. That's where you find the deprivation - in the money that is no longer changing hands. And, if you think that a person who goes bankrupt because they can no longer charge for their work isn't harmed, you need a new definition of ""harm"".<p>One more thing: saying - as you do - that ""it's just a bunch of ones and zeroes"" to a person who may have sweated blood and tears for years to produce the arrangement that actually attracted your attention is just awful. It's an attitude that reflects something deeply rotten about you as a human being. Just understand this: culture thrives in spite of people like you, not because of them. In addition to the money you owe directly to artists, you own a debt of gratitude to those who did get them paid when you refused to do the same.",1350782398
