You can take as long as you'd like to learn.  Doing that, you can spend as much time as you'd like with friends/family, doing community work or anything else you choose.  If you're motivated (and possibly unemployed), doing whatever it takes over a 3 month period to learn how to do front-end development might make sense.  But like any other decision, there are tradeoffs.  This ""all-in"" boot-camp style takes a lot of dedication.

As a result, I think I've ruled out database level solutions.<p>What does hosting with Heroku have to do with using a trigger?<p>> On a related note, it feels good to know that everything our app needs to run is in the code base.<p>Except the database schema and any additional indexes you need to make it not perform terribly.  All basic setup, just like creating triggers.<p>> Rails fights that with migrations and the callback chain too, so I guess that thinking has sunk in for me.<p>The problem with doing stuff like this in a callback is that an additional query is sent to the database which can be a big performance problem if the insert load is high.  I generally agree that complex logic should be avoided in triggers and is better left in the application code in most cases but incrementing a counter is about as simplistic as you can get.",1350358802

There's tons of opportunities available, but after doing some research it seems like only the most elite students get these positions. Folks from Cal, Stanford, and Ivy Leagues snatch these positions without any trouble.<p>I'm just a guy who is finishing his community college classes and wants some work experience before transferring to a 4 year college. I've taken various math, C++, Java, and UNIX classes but I don't have much experience outside of that. I'm currently teaching myself data structures/algorithms and try to code little programs implementing them. There's a few other languages I'm playing around with, but its nothing serious. Aside from that, my programming ability is a bit weak, and I'm worried I won't be able to compete with the other applicants.<p>My main strength is that I'm a fairly quick learner. Given a language or technology, I can probably learn it pretty well in 1-2 weeks with lots of studying. When it comes to actually implementing that knowledge, I'll need a bit of guidance. I'm still a newbie after all.<p>So what kind of qualities in an intern are companies looking for? Do they expect the intern to be a ""rockstar coding ninja"" or are they willing to take in a complete newbie and let him try to stay afloat? Also, would I be expected to do whiteboard coding during an interview to one of the smaller companies? I'm obviously not applying to Google or Facebook, but smaller companies. For instance, I'm interested in: Ooyala, Evernote Corporation, Terravide, and a few others like that.<p>I'd appreciate if someone could give me any insight, and perhaps even suggest any places to apply to that are willing to take in people like me.

That doesn't mean they are a monopoly, but they certain can and do set their own rules about how business should be done on the internet.<p>For example, Google artificially inflates their AdWords ad rates using the quality score algorithm. It's an ingenious little black box that they can turn up the dial periodically as needed without looking like they are raising their rates, they're just ""adjusting the algorithm"".<p>Or, Google has many times changed their organic listings that hurt businesses traffic enough to push them to AdWords. For example, selling links as advertising can get you banned from Google, and Google aggressively pursues link networks because they can be a cost effective way of advertising on Google that is cheaper than AdWords.<p>Google does open source and a lot of amazing things for the tech community, but it's also a business out to protect its core business - online advertising and search. Sure, it has a right to do these things on its own network, but when you own 60, 70, 80% of the internet search volume, it's a fine line between reasonable business decision and anti-competitive behavior.",1350356973
