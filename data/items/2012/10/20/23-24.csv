4678475,comment,4677893,4677893,5,0,bjourne,,,"There are several wrong things with that post. First of the PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro checks that pkg-config is present on the system and presents a nice error message if it isn't. Second, PKG_CHECK_MODULES can be used to specify several dependencies:<p><pre><code>    PKG_CHECK_MODULES(DEP, foo udev >= 999 neverhere)\n</code></pre>\nThen if one or more of the dependencies aren't met, all problems are shown:<p><pre><code>    Package foo was not found in the pkg-config search path.\n    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `foo.pc'\n    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\n    No package 'foo' found\n    Requested 'udev >= 999' but version of udev is 175\n    Package neverhere was not found in the pkg-config search     path.\n    Perhaps you should add the directory containing `neverhere.pc'\n    to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable\n    No package 'neverhere' found\n</code></pre>\nIt may not seem like much, but for someone not used to compiling stuff from source it means a lot that all missing dependencies are shown at once. A sloppy shell script to check for the same dependencies would mean that the user would first see ""foo not found"" and go and download that package, then ""udev >= 175 required"" and when that is fixed the third error and so on.<p>Also, the error message ""You can download mono from www.go.mono.com"" isn't very useful for most Linux users. The correct remedy on distros that ship with devel packages is to figure out the name of the package that supplies the include headers and pkg-config file and istall that. pkg-configs error message aren't that great either, but at least they are easily recognizable.<p>In my opinion, autoconf is a very misguided build system. It is designed so that it should have no other requirements on the compiling users system other than a POSIX environment, a shell and a C compiler. It is a completely unnecessary constraint because nowadays everyone is able to install great languages like Python, Ruby, Scheme and many others much more suitable for writing build configuration systems than shell script. There is no point anymore in using the M4 language to generate a 1000 line configure script when a 50 line Python/Ruby/$OtherNiceScriptingLanguage would work just as well.",1350776351

4678471,comment,4677497,4677497,3,0,Jare,,,"This looks very interesting, but I have a few comments from the introduction:<p>- Single-page apps offer a more native-app-like experience, but there's no reason they must throw away the advantages of web over app. Almost any conceivable app is going to have different top-level states, and many apps are going to let you access different pieces of content. Support URLs to go directly to those states and to those pieces of content for two reasons: ability to be linked / indexed from outside, and navigability via the browser history. I believe the correct way to look at this is to explicitly think of these top-level states/content, and then look at supporting them in a URL, not the other way around that you suggest (""we probably need to reduce the level of detail that we support in URLs somewhat"").<p>- The MVC pattern predates web apps, web sites and the www itself. The thing I always found shocking was that server side apps, not client, used the pattern at all. That said, getting rid of controllers altogether due to the myriad approaches and variants that exist out in the wild is a sensible idea.<p>Many thanks for taking the time to write this book!",1350776144

4678459,comment,4677893,4678400,5,0,Tobu,,,"One thing that improves reliability is in fact to get rid of the configuration step. Not just the workarounds for broken shells or old Solaris/HP-UX versions with anemic libcs, but the principle of disabling some features or switching to alternative implementations when something isn't found. It just creates new code paths and combinatorial complexity, probably broken because the developer's environment will never trigger them. Distro packagers already prefer hard fails to know when they are missing a dependency.<p>To compensate, the replacement just needs to offer better facilities for triggering installs of the missing dependencies. That's basically the path taken by modern languages (Go, Python, Ruby, Node gnome's jh_build is part of the same trend): they have tools to fetch source dependencies from the network, to install in custom prefixes that don't require root, to create isolated prefixes so that multiple versions can be installed in parallel, to freeze known-good versions of the dependency graph.<p>But those little knobs so you can build your own customised version with decals and your own red spoiler?

I can only think of perhaps two games that I have gone that far.<p>Perhaps I'm not a loyal gamer or a super-fan of any game.  But I do buy games, probably 1 or 2 per month.  With 100 free levels it's most likely that people like myself would never even get to the stage where purchasing this game was necessary - even if I loved it.  And if there was no reminder, I may not even really think about it.<p>It's wonderful to be a nice company and to give away something really fun for people to play.  But, there's no need to be so nice that you can't stay in business.  Especially with games at $0.99 or whatever, it really is not asking much for people to pay a little to help support the game that they enjoy.",1350774542
