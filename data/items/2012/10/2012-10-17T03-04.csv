The ""equation results"" section of the wikipedia page shows the range of variability: there may be anywhere from hundreds of millions of civilizations in our galaxy, to maybe we're the only one in the entire universe (a difference of close to 30 orders of magnitude), based on different guesses for some of the other parameters.  Both sets of numbers are using the current understanding that we can discover exoplanets etc. and that they're not terribly rare.  Prior to that understanding, estimates varied by another 5-10 orders of magnitude.<p>In other words, these newer discoveries don't get us particularly close to a definitive answer from the Drake Equation.  We still don't know whether there's intelligent life at millions of stars in each of billions of galaxies, or if it's possibly just us.<p>The only sort of data that would let us actually use it to generate a meaningful answer would be the discovery of more intelligent life.",1350445801

The expression anecdotal evidence refers to evidence from anecdotes. Because of the small sample, there is a larger chance that it may be unreliable due to cherry-picked or otherwise non-representative samples of typical cases.[1][2] Anecdotal evidence is considered dubious support of a claim; it is accepted only in lieu of more solid evidence.

Hell, use the JVM or the CLR, just as long as it doesn't tie me to a specific language. Dart may be better than JavaScript (I would hope so) but that doesn't mean it's a silver bullet. If we create a standardized bytecode, it doesn't matter what language produced it.</i><p>I've been thinking about something like this for a long time. However, the question came up in an interview or presentation with either Brendan Eich or Douglas Crockford (I can't remember exactly where I read this) about why Javascript won out over a VM solution (supposedly this is what the JVM was made for). The most salient argument against a universal VM was that maintaining backwards compatibility between byte-code versions and the competing eco-system of languages would have been a nightmare. Instead the web targeted a single language (and all the trouble that has been along with it). I would rather like to see other languages on the web but I don't think a browser is good place to do it.<p>Instead what I'd rather see is <a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/ulfar/cuba/paper/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/ulfar/cuba/paper/</a> -- work could be done to improve that initial design, but the idea IMO is that the OS already handles processes and allocating memory well and the browser vendors are terrible at this task by comparison.<p>Either way, Dart is an interesting experiment and I'd give it a shot on some prototyping projects.",1350445106

It is one of my favorite pieces of work: it canonicalizes queries and can tell you a number of useful statistics on it.<p>One of the advantages is that it can help you identify queries that are both very short but frequent (and could use a cache, or whatnot), and would fly below the radar of most log aggregations, because most people turn off logging off for very short statements.

It's too easy to delete an edge, and spend a bunch of time trying to redo your work. That really pisses off users.<p>Also, not giving the edges of the graph a direction is a problem -- it's hard to quickly grasp what the 'result' node should be. Ditto for not using fixed-position plugs on the nodes: input plugs should be at the top, outputs at the bottom (or left and right).<p>In the end, I'm not sure who this is for: if you just want to click a button to deploy some services, it's doubtful that you'll want to muck around with wiring up nodes; and if you're putting these packages together, it'll probably be faster to just use a text editor.",1350443352

A conversation about productivity systems must exclude those that are in the ""doesn't work"" and ""interesting new idea"" stages.<p>3. Productivity systems and workflows are not personality (or personality type) dependent - what works for one person doesn't qualify as something worth investigating by those who identify with the ""successful user"".<p>I think #2 and #3 stand alone, but #1 is a bit more interesting:<p>There exist people for whom any productivity system will not work in the long run. There are several factors that can be involved in this:<p>* they are actually more productive when ramping up a system and early in using it - the thinking about the system to productivity inspires actual productivity. Once they internalize the rules and the ramp up, it stops working because they don't focus any more<p>* The sort of person who internally chafes at rules/structure may experience productivity at first with a new system, because (s)he as decided to comply with that system, but subconsciously starts to figure out ways to meet the rules of the productivity system without actually being productive. Some people just do this, whether they intend to or or not, it's just a thing.<p>* Novelty itself inspires them to do more<p>* Productivity inspires productivity - the act of setting up a productivity system is productive, therefor inspiring other productivity elsewhere. (similar to the first example but a bit different)<p>And so on.<p>Why not give such people another system or lifehack or workflow hack or whatever you label it, to chew on?<p>(ok I claimed I'd leave #3 alone, but experiments like this allow people see more things that work for someone a bit, and help give them ideas to tailor the system to themselves)",1350443195

4662994,comment,4660793,4661282,3,0,msutherl,,,"Indeed, ""creative"" in this context refers to special attention paid to creating new concepts. A ""creative programmer"" is somebody who's occupation is to come up with new ideas in code. This contrasts with ""non-creative"" programmers, who typically apply sound techniques to known problems.<p>When programming websites, for instance, the scope of the problem is well defined and the programmer's task is to select from an array of known solutions and integrate them into a system that is robust, secure, responsive, scalable, elegant, etc. This is an inherently ""creative"" task  every programmer solves the problem in a new way  but the emphasis is on robustness, elegance, etc. and not on the idea.<p>On the flip side, creative programmers are not expected to create especially robust software. They often write software for a single event (often just a demo) on a single platform and poor software quality is regularly tolerated.<p>All that said, I think the term ""experimental"" is infinitely more appropriate. Unfortunately ""creative"" has become an industry term and we'll have to wait a generation for it to go way.",1350442820
