The fact that the accused is guilty or is a total dirtbag doesn't preclude the victim from having been malicious or idiotic, and the victim's failings don't necessitate that we feel more sympathetic for the accused -- but rather that we feel less sympathetic for the victim. And that goes on the scale like anything else. There is a reason that self-defense is a defense to murder. The victim's actions matter.<p>The reason that ""blaming the victim"" is so offensive in the rape case, and why that is always brought out as the poster child for ""don't blame the victim,"" is that in the rape case it implies that wearing a revealing outfit is enough to excuse rape. Which is so clearly, unquestionably wrong that it makes a very emotionally powerful case for the logically unsupportable position that the victim's actions never matter for <i>anything</i>.<p>But ""don't [ever] blame the victim"" is bad reasoning. To make it correct you would have to qualify it with something like ""don't blame the victim when the victim isn't to blame"" -- and that's just a tautology that doesn't help you determine when the victim is to blame. The fact that we know for sure that the victim isn't to blame in certain cases (e.g. rape) doesn't help for other cases where it isn't so clear.",1349582334

So, while it's nice you can use Node.js for when the situation call for it, but what about the other 90% of web programming, that we perform in Python, Ruby, PHP, etc? Where is a Javascript container for generic web based programming, one to rival RoR or at least Sinatra/Flask (and NOT be evented / callback-based)?<p>b) What happened to the idea of Javascript on the command line, as a general purpose scripting language? It might not be a perfect language, but it's used by millions, it's probably the fastest dynamic language, with four very fast JITed implementations, and ES6 fixes a lot of pain points. IIRC, Common JS was an effort to use it for general purpose scripting. What happened to that?",1349582047

This protocol gives you an implicit crash-recovery story, there is no need for additional journaling on top of it.<p>Journalling is used when some blocks on the disk are scheduled to be overwritten. Instead, the blocks are written in a separate location (the so-called journal). At a later point in time, the data blocks get overwritten. Once the data is safely on the disk (via Forced Unit Access (FUA) or a flush track cache-type operation) we can then truncate the journal.<p>Log-structured systems do not do this. Instead, the achieve crash safety via never overwriting data; they always write elsewhere (into something called 'the log'). Eventually, too much of this log is filled with garbage, stale data. This is when 'cleaning' occurs. However, cleaning is expensive and slow. You must read a large amount of data, figure out what is alive/dead, and then write it all out.<p>F2FS's contribution to FS design seems to be handling this cleaning operation in a more graceful manner.",1349582036

4622545,comment,4621560,4622436,3,0,tzs,,,"I can definitely see why Wiley is concerned. I've seen some editions for Asia or India that are cheap crap--bad enough that I'd rather buy the US edition because I like to keep my books and the foreign crap will fall apart after a couple reads. Sure, many people would buy the cheap editions and put up with the crap, but a lot of people would avoid them.<p>The Wiley foreign editions are not like those. When my Wiley copies of Apostol's ""Calculus"" volumes I and II started falling apart after 30 years of being my goto books when I needed to refresh my memory of calculus, I bought the Indian paperback editions. The pages are a little smaller than the US hardback and a little lower quality, but the binding is well done, all the material is there, and they were about $30 each (with shipping) compared to $200/each for the hardbacks.<p>If the Wiley Indian editions were readily available in the US, there would be almost no reason to buy the US edition, at least for textbooks like Apostol, where there are no color diagrams.<p>It was interesting that the total price, books + shipping, was about the same no matter where they were bought from. I could have bought from an India seller for about $5, with $25 shipping, or from US importers for about $25, with $5 shipping. I think I did find a couple Indian and Chinese sellers where I could have saved maybe $5 overall, but no way was I giving my credit card to a seller on the other side of the world that I could find no reviews of anywhere online.<p>BTW, those hardbacks in 1977 cost about the same as the paperbacks 30 years later. In hindsight, it would have been a good investment in 1977 to buy a bunch of copies, and resell them 30 years later. (And yes, there would be a market for them 30 years later. These books, in the same edition I bought in 1977, are still used at Caltech, MIT, and in the ""honors"" calculus classes at a few other top schools).",1349581610

4622542,comment,4618069,4620763,2,0,pbsd,,,"A 512-bit hash provides roughly 256 bits of resistance against collision attacks. We (presumably) want to match that level of strength with our signature scheme.<p>RSA and DSA are based on the integer factorization and finite field discrete logarithm problems, respectively. The number field sieve has a complexity (very roughly) proportional to 2^(b^(1/3)), for b-bit keys. This means that keys have to be proportional to 2^(b^3) to achieve b-bit security. For a concrete example, 256-bit security requires ~16384 RSA/DSA keys (this is using a less rough approximation of the NFS complexity).<p>On the other hand, well-chosen elliptic curve groups have (or appear to) much less structure than the above. In generic groups, the best we can do to solve the discrete logarithm are generic attacks, like Rho or BSGS. Those run in time proportional to 2^(b/2). Therefore, we only need keys of size 2^(2b) to achieve b-bit security (512-bit keys for 256-bit security). Bit for bit, elliptic curves are much more efficient to deliver the same level of security. This results in other advantages, like tolerable speed.",1349581534

But most places will kick any user that gets hit with a DoS attack that is large enough to disrupt service to other customers.<p>I mean, I agree that 'finishing the job' and letting the attacker win by null-routing the target is... a suboptimal way to deal with the problem, but with pipe-filling attacks?  if the attacker can send more bytes than your pipe can handle, there is really no other realistic way to handle the problem.  (I mean, you can try to trace down the source and call up the ISPs the packets are coming from, but BCP38 is still not widely implemented, so good luck tracing a spoofed source more than one or two hops up, and meanwhile, as you are calling people up and trying to get through to someone skillful enough to figure out where a spoofed packet is coming from, you are down.)<p>There are 'clean pipe' services, where someone with a very large pipe says they will programatically detect and block DoS traffic, then pass along the good traffic to your (much smaller) pipe, and yes, those services can work /if/ the service provider has a larger pipe than the attacker.   Of course, buying such a service from a service provider with a sufficiently large pipe is, as you can imagine, quite expensive.  Buying such a service from someone that has less available bandwidth than your attackers are able to throw at the problem, of course, is completely useless.<p>So yeah, uh, assuming you can't afford to be on a 'clean pipe' that is backed by a huge network, you are much better off with an ISP that proactively shuts down DoS targets than one that doesn't.   Unless, of course, you are a DoS target.<p>I mean, the economics of pipe-filling denial of service attacks, right now, are heavily tilted in favour of the attacker.  It is a problem that needs to be solved, but I don't know how to solve it.",1349581496

It's more that rewards like bonuses and salary increases should be tied to the results that matter, and not to overtime that could just as easily indicate an ineffective worker as dedication.<p>And while start-ups often require extreme hours due to the fact that building a successful business is <i>hard</i>, an established business should not demand extreme hours as part of normal business. If you do, you're risking employee burn-out, and probably not taking into account the costs that can lead to.

I assume they must do something similar in other countries.<p>As for why Apple would benefit, I'm afraid I don't agree.  Sure, having a few dozen more employees with deep mapping experience would probably be great, but I'm not sure it's the real issue.  Nor do I think it likely that the user-provided data would trump the quality of any of the major map players at this point.<p>If you look at the complaints that people are making, many of them down to public transit, poor proper name matching, and regional map quality.  Of those, I doubt Waze will provide any meaningful improvement for Apple.  To my knowledge, they don't touch public transit, because that's counter to their target.  I seriously doubt they do well with proper name searches (do they even support it?) because their target is the commuter, not the guy looking for the nearest Chipotle.  And for regional quality, I'd bet that they're weakest in the same areas that Apple is weak in.<p>I'm not sure why you think mapping data from Nokia or TomTom would be updated on a yearly schedule.  The fact that non-connected GPS devices might be updated on that schedule doesn't mean that their databases are updated on that schedule, or that partners would be limited to updates on that schedule.  Nokia and TomTom can, and almost certainly do, update their data constantly, just like Google Maps, and Waze, and undoubtedly Apple as well.",1349581082

I don't see anything in the constitution about enforcing international copyright law within the United States.

Or are we not textualists? :-)<p>Frankly, I don't really care whether it's legal/constitutional or not. I'm more worried about whether it's a good idea.

I was actually happy to see they did $57m losses on $250m revenues; even happier when I saw that a large sum of the loss was the new staff.<p>Worry not, because, in my opinion; Spotify is here to stay and is solving a problem that is certainly worth solving.<p>Its the combination of several factors:<p>A previous commenter stated that Spotify is not only competing for iTunes' money, but with piracy too. I agree; they're converting a client that was worth $0.00 over their lifetime (as well as those who 'pirated and then purchased', etc) into paying the artist per listen. That's absolutely radical.<p>The $20m increase in staffing is a direct product of this vision. The new staff is hard at work at making Spotify available on as many platforms, as beautifully as possible, with as many artists and in as many countries as possible.<p>The price, whether it be $9.99 or $12.45, won't be the problem, pricing can be fixed later with more data.<p>The only danger Spotify faces is the resistance it is facing in 'the rest of the world', where there may be entrenched local media companies with distribution rights, or local music/label representatives may be weary of the payment model. That would limit their scale, and Spotify needs scale to work.<p>... thank god for the $100m Sean Parker found for Spotify, and for the X billions more he can sway for it as well. I'd bet on Spotify today more than ever, it may be a long bet, but we haven't seen such a successful contender in this category since iTunes.<p>Spotify is an A+ example of what every other startup with 1/100th of the business plan or cojones is trying to do: Spotify is aiming to become a billion dollar company, and I congratulate them for that.<p>The music industry is worth spending tens, hundreds, even thousands of millions to fix/disrupt/change/make better.",1349579354

If a star performer showed up late, left early and never arrived to a meeting on time but they were doing amazing work, they'd be given a lot of leeway to do that - again, by a good manager.<p>That is how sales works. Top salesmen do whatever they want, nobody questions their methods nor cares about how 'committed' they seem - the only thing that matters is how much more money they are bringing the company than everybody else.<p>I've never worked at a Google/Facebook/Amazon class tech company but I would imagine it is similar with 10x engineers and designers there.",1349579311
