I did not claim that once you added the volatile qualifier that you could still use the existing implementation of memset: if you simply cast the pointer to volatile and then pass it to the existing version of memset, you will certainly get a diagnostic indicating that you lost the qualifier, as memset itself does not have volatile as part of its type definition.<p>However, the author's attempts to redefine memset without using volatile rely on gcc limitations: in the first ""trivial"" case that it does not use abstract interpretation while looking for constant variables (in this case, it should be easy to fold that loop down to ""oh, that rvalue is always a constant 0), and in the second that it does not do extensive optimization across compilation units.<p>As for the other thing you noticed: while I would imagine that the gcc-specific ""I am the developer and want you to do something very special and important"" __attribute__ would override any notion that it might have regarding ""volatile"", they are really orthogonal concepts: with just that prototype the compiler wouldn't even know if that function does anything at all with the memory you passed... the function might just do something with the pointer value and not indirect it at all; therefore, one would pretty much demand that ""pure"" have the semantics that gcc is giving it here.",1351504129

4711605,comment,4711346,4711346,10,0,cygx,,,"Personally, I'd just write a wrapper function for memset().<p>The following one works in at least gcc 4.5.3 and clang 3.1, but is actually not guaranteed to work by C language semantics:<p><pre><code>    static inline void memzero(void *volatile block, size_t size)
    {
        memset(block, 0, size);
    }
</code></pre>
A safe alternative is<p><pre><code>    static inline void memzero(void *block, size_t size)
    {
        static void *(*volatile const memset_)(void *, int, size_t) = memset;
        memset_(block, 0, size);

That comment is also shorter, so it is probably provides more ""bang for the buck"" to read it instead of mine.)<p>I am pretty certain that memset is not conceptually being handled especially different: it is simply being inlined. If you have a memset of a variable to 0, gcc's compiled output might involve just a single mov instruction and if it is a small array, it might be a few mov instructions: if it is a lot of memory being cleared, it might involve a call.<p>However, as it is inlined, the semantics are pretty clear for how it should work (and attributes like pure will be deduced, as they would for any function you include in your actual code; you don't need to mark it as such <- edit: to be clear, though, that I really don't think that memset is ""pure""... it is pretty much the exact opposite of ""pure""): it is equivalent to assigning a variable a value, and if that variable's value will not ever be used, then the assignment will not happen.<p>Instead, if the developer really really <i>really</i> insists that that assignment happen even if, from the perspective of the C language standard there is no legitimate side effect of that operation, the correct thing to do is to temporarily qualify the pointer with volatile and <i>then</i> do whatever it is you wanted (such as wiping it).<p>Sadly, this article does not even in a single place mention ""volatile"", so I'm not certain that the author understood how this works. Instead, he states that a ""solution"" is to instead put a zero in the first element and then copy it to subsequent elements... something that could easily be detected by abstract interpretation, and which a sufficiently smart compiler would be correct in also optimizing away.",1351502958

Of course those are bases from which we've also visited Mallorca, Granada, Lisbon, Uruguay, Santiago (Chile), Mendoza, Mrida, Dublin and Paris. This is done while working on average 7-8 billable hours, 5-6 days a week, with some gaps in between for ""touristy stuff.""<p>All of the advice in the article about settling in to a new place rings true, particularly the internet connectivity situation. We've had difficulties in about half the places we've lived, but have also had the good fortune of incredibly considerate locals who have bent over backwards to assist.<p>Because we're both working, we decided to keep our house in Los Angeles and rent it out. We started with my friend acting as a property manager, but have since found that as long as we have a handyman, plumber and various other maintenance and repair people, the middleman only causes delays in communication. It's pretty amazing what can be done from the other side of the world.<p>We'll be in Europe until the end of January (as Americans, the Schengen agreement is a continual thorn in our plans), and haven't yet determined where we'll head next. Financially, the expensive part is hopping from place to place. If you can find somewhere whose tourist visas allow 6 months (UK, Mexico) or where you can pop across the border for a day and get it renewed (Argentina), you can cut down on a lot of expenses (and stress) by planting yourself for longer.<p>All that said, I highly recommend it. The opportunity to experience other cultures, learn a new language, and gain a different perspective on life is invaluable. Even for the process of winnowing your ""stuff"" down to what you're willing to carry with you while traveling for months on end.<p>It also has the side benefit of making you one of the more interesting people at any gathering you attend.",1351502660

Processing is getting wider, but staying a similar speed... except IO - which has gone from 40MB/s to 1000MB/s for fairly cheap hardware.  The network has also sped up in a major way, with terabits/s possible. Branch prediction allows us to follow multiple possible serial paths, and the wider our processors the more branches we can follow.  Software advances have made it trivial for even beginner programmers to process many events in parallel. Automatic vectorizing compilers have been available for over a decade now.  Transactional memory is becoming mainstream, with compiler support and even hardware support.  Massive libraries of highly optimized maths and scientific routines are being developed by 1000s of people at once over the internet and made available for free.  I don't think it's hard to use up all that power.  Even on the cutting edge, gaining a 10x or 100x speed up is not unheard of.  Problems are becoming more and more about the functionality required, and the vision, rather than being limited by the processing speed and power available.<p>tldr; we are ok, and we're going to be ok.",1351502455
