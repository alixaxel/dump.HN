4600860,comment,4599232,4600157,3,0,yason,,,"Cache locality is easily approached in closed hashing by dividing the complete slot array into aligned page-sized chunks. Then part of the hash value points to the chunk and the rest of the hash value is used to do the secondary probe linearly within that chunk so all reads take place in the L1 cache. For example, if each slot contains the hash and a pointer to the object (for final key comparison), you can fit 512 entries onto a single 4K page in a 32-bit system.<p>(Of course, the chunks must eventually be processed linearly if they're all full and the key isn't found till the last chunk, but this is again a degenerate case which generally isn't a problem as long as the hash table is resized often enough as it grows.)",1349160918

4600840,comment,4596964,4597437,1,0,yason,,,"How is that a barrier? Extremely problematic? What the heck?<p>First, note that it's my impression that logic and action are more dominant with men. Based on my experience on life, women, men, and relationships, logic and action seems to strenghten men's inherent identities. Men feel manly when they build stuff and solve problems, and that's generally <i>essential</i> to a male identifying himself as a man. This applies to cocky behaviour and winning women, too.<p>Now, women can certainly do both. I know women with high capabilities in logic and action such as my wife but the thing is that women often <i>choose not to</i>: their identities are enforced by other things in life. Unlike with men, for women it's not <i>essential</i> to exercise logical problems in order to be a woman. My wife doesn't rediscover her feminine identity in solving problems and fixing stuff eventhough she has done and succeeded in that before we met. My daughter is more interested in fixing bicycles and learning to use the tools in my toolbox than my son is, but it's the other things that she already does that she's using to learn how to grow up to become a woman.<p>Thus, I suggested the especially masculine trait of enjoying logic <i>might</i> contribute to the gender bias of programming as it seems to contribute to the gender bias of other activities, too. (Or it might not, but I didn't happen to suggest that.)<p>It's not a barrier, however. It's choosing not to drink, even if brought down to the water. And that's <i>perfectly okay</i>!<p>This might just be too much to accept for people of naivete. Men and women <i>are</i> different and there's generally no way around that in the long run.<p>EDIT: Back to the topic: programming doesn't give a squat about whether you're a man or a woman. It only requires logical capabilities and the willingness to use them. It doesn't dictate where the willingness comes from and for what I know, my fellow programmers don't give a rat's ass who wrote the code. They would accept women where they accept men because gender isn't a criteria in communicating with source code.",1349160117

It's not entirely due to the increase of USD, there are demand/supply characteristics that have created a mild inflation in the price (note the cost of extraction affects only profits, not price).<p>However, the popular view is that the oil price is rising massively due to (a) greedy oil companies or (b) oil running out.  Neither is really the case, and historically the oil price isn't significantly different to the band it has been in for the last 30 years.  The data used for showing that the oil price is rising is by comparing it to the price ~10 years ago to now.   But that is obscured by the fact that currency devaluation in that time period accounts for a large percentage of the sticker price rise.  The real price rise is far less.",1349158153
