4650360,comment,4649524,4649524,29,0,jamesmcn,,,"This is a special case of a more general rule: Do things.<p>I'm going to try to write more. I already have learned a lot by:<p>* photography. If you spend time thinking about the photographs you take, and use what you discover in that process to change how you take future photographs, you will learn a lot about the world around you. You start to see things that you previously ignored.<p>* painting / sketching / drawing. Totally different from photography. You are free to represent what you want how you want. Your work can range from highly introspective (can be great while your subconscious brain is solving some other problem) to very literal. I haven't kept up with this because the professional world doesn't look kindly on developers who are splattering ink across a page when they ""should"" be coding, but it was very helpful in my college years.<p>* music composition. You think you know something about music? Try to compose some! You will listen to music differently. The deeper you go, the more you learn. Music is an unimaginably vast subject and conventional music theory only gives you access to a tiny fraction of the space that music occupies.<p>* (audio) Field recording. Have you ever taken the time to listen? To <i>really</i> listen? Probably not. You can get audio recorder apps for your iphone, or use a standalone digital audio recorder. Take these recordings home, and listen to them on decent headphones. Then go back to where you made the recording. Think about how the recording and what you hear are different. We selectively filter out a <i>lot</i> of the world around us, particularly in the audio domain.<p>* electronics. In support of my audio hobbies, I've built several audio devices, ranging from simple synthesizers up to rhythm machines and modules for larger systems. In the software world, we lose track of the physical world. It is mind-boggling how much effort you have to put in to source parts for a moderately complex project.<p>and finally:<p>* Coding. Those of us who code understand software in ways that people who don't do not. It doesn't make it any easier to use other people's software (sometimes harder), but it does change the way you think about things.<p>TL;DR: Don't just learn stuff, try doing stuff as well.",1350179940

Google prefers python for the first attempt at a problem allegedly for the ease of prototyping.<p>I think Chuck Moore (of Forth fame) frequently propounds an important idea when it comes to improving HPC performance. Of course, Chuck Moore doesn't do HPC optimization that I know of. But he does talk a lot about thinking about the whole problem and avoiding premature optimization. As such, it sounds like the hash join algorithm is not well suited to some parallel problems - so what? Pick the right tool for the job. Picking a hash table could be premature optimization if the problem demands massive parallel scalability.<p>It seems flowlang.net is right to say that massive parallel scalability will rapidly become a must-have at most companies.",1350179840

4650356,comment,4648843,4650191,2,0,cycle,,,"iOS presents a programming model of MVC where the view can be anything. This is basically the same programming model as on OS X and similar to the programming model for windows if you use MFC. I found iOS libraries to be more traditional OS like and more mature. In contrast, Android forces you into activities, layouts, and intents. Layouts basically don't let you layout out things on a pixel basis unless you use the deprecated absolute layout. So Android is forcing you to try to write apps that work on a wide variety of devices and that interoperable with each other and they do this by forcing a different programming model on the programmer. How one transitions from one screen to another in iOS is how you would expect it to bd done in OS X or Windows. Android forces it via intents instead. Basically on iOS, I feel more in control except when the documentation is intentionally obscure but on Android I feel like I am programming in service of multi-device support, interoperability, and have to seriously limit the APIs I can use because over half of the devices out there are 2 major versions behind: no hardware acceleration and an animation system that has been replaced.",1350179811

I've read writings about mathematics education by Boaler and by Milgram, and have used those for preparing the mathematics classes I teach locally, and I have had a lot of email correspondence (mostly on email lists) with Wayne Bishop. I'm amazed that the root page of Boaler's faculty website at Stanford is being used for this kind of writing. I'm trying to get to the bottom of the actual facts involved. For that purpose, I'm sharing this same link among my Facebook friends, who include several innovators in mathematics education.<p>I appreciate the links that droithomme has shared in this thread. Yes, there is a lot of passion about what should be done to improve mathematics education in the United States, and one of the chief issues of contention is how to gauge the effectiveness of new programs. I'm pretty satisfied with the results of the homeschooling materials I chose for my oldest son (who is now a programmer for a startup). Over the years I've learned a lot from some of the same friends I'm asking for responses to this link. I hope we can puzzle out who is really coming forward with better evidence about what effective mathematics teaching is, because the United States could certainly use better mathematics instruction than it now has.",1350179789

Software engineering is prone to a significant minority of people who are not so self-confident.<p>Personally, I am. In my opinion, whenever someone tries to drag in a methodology from other engineering disciplines they do so with a blinding ignorance of ""cost"" side of the cost/benefit ratio (and often non-trivial ignorance on the ""benefit"" side too), and the real differences between software and physical things. If car engineers <i>could</i> smash a car into a wall, observe something they didn't like, tweak something and 30 seconds be smashing another car into a wall effectively for free, their design methodology would be different too. (And if you feel inclined to get into a really detailed argument about how it would affect them because you think I'm assuming something about exactly how it would be different, you're missing my point, which is simply that it would indeed be <i>different</i>.

4650325,comment,4629317,4646241,1,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Hmm. I appreciate the strength of your feelings. That said I disagree with you on a couple of points here.<p>Before I explain my thinking though, I first want to apologise if I came across as overly dismissive of people with Asperger's in my last post. I assure you that was not my intention. I do not intend to attack or criticise. Seriously. I have nothing against people with Asperger's - I find the whole notion that there is or should be some sort of conflict between neurotypicals and people with Asperger's baffling. I feel sympathy for people with Asperger's just as I feel sympathy for all human beings, especially so because it seems like people with Asperger's have a pretty hard time of life in a lot of areas.<p>>they seem to be incapable (or uninterested in) tricking and manipulating their fellow man simply for their own benefit, regardless of the detriment to others.<p>>Unpredictable, lying, manipulative, socio-parasitic people.<p>I will try and summarise what you seem to be suggesting: the world is a seething mass of deceit and trickery, and people with Asperger's are just too honest for their own good. The ""lying parasite"" view of humanity.<p>I disagree with this. I think what you are describing does not reflect reality. I think you are expressing a stereotype, and a pretty extreme one at that. Personally, my experience of the world is that people are generally very generous and honest. Regardless, what is more important for me here is to understand WHY you (or in general someone with Asperger's) would come to feel this way. Here are my two guesses. NB: this is all just my speculation. I am not claiming to know for sure that any of this is right.<p>The first guess is that someone would Asperger's would naturally become extremely frustrated by their inability to understand the feelings and motivations of others, and thus function smoothly in normal society. I can only imagine how frustrating that must be. Often, when people are frustrated like that for such a long time, quite naturally they develop a justification to minimise their sense of failure or not-fitting-in - something along the lines of ""It's not my fault - it's their fault! They're all fucked - the whole system is fucked."" This helps because, instead of feeling like they have failed because they can't do something, they feel like they have succeeded because they purposefully chose to avoid something. Psychologically, they have regained a feeling of autonomy and control.<p>My second guess is that someone with Asperger's might assume that their own feelings and ideas about what they are expected to do are widespread. This is called projection in psychology. That is to say, someone with Asperger's might feel like they are pressured to ""pretend"" or ""lie"" in order to please others. Which could lead to thoughts like ""Why do I have to pretend - shouldn't people accept me as I am?"" This could be worsened if they feel like the reasons people offer sound instrumentalist - like they must pretend to be a certain way (caring, interested, jolly etc) so normal people will like them. This sounds like manipulation - and quite naturally again someone with Asperger's could assume that this is how ALL people work - they all pretend to be nice, they all feel like shit inside, they all just do it to get what they want. They project their internal state onto the world at large.<p>These two guesses may or may not be correct. Please note I am trying to offer them without judgement of any sort. I think they are the sorts of things that any perfectly normal person would do in that sort of situation. If you feel like crap, you try to make it better somehow.<p>But again, and especially on the second point, that view of normal society is just not correct. People are on the whole honest. Seriously. For most people, sympathy with others come pretty naturally. For most people, some days they feel good and some days they feel like crap, and they act however they feel. They don't walk around constantly trying to suppress their inner state, filled with deceit and distrust, just trying to manipulate each other!<p>The second point I want to rebut is your assumption that I do not understand technology. That it is a ""black box puzzle."" I'm sorry, but you're just plain wrong on that one. Why should you assume that social intelligence and analytical intelligence are mutually exclusive? It makes no sense to me - I can only hazard a guess that it might be a superiority reaction - thinking something like ""Well yeah, but they don't understand what I'm great at.""<p>Third, (and I apologise for rattling this off, I'd spend more time going over my thoughts but I'm in a bit of a rush) is your idea that neurotypicals and people with Asperger's are necessarily at war with each other - that normal society is a lazy, parasitic entity that feeds off the work of people with heightened analytical intelligences, chewing them up and spitting them out just because they don't have the inner dishonesty to protect themselves. Again, I think this is wrong, and curious to boot. Do you really feel like you are so abused and mistreated? That wider society is so dismissive of people with Asperger's? Society is a pretty sprawling construct - it's not like there's a council of neurotypicals that gets together every three years to set policy on the oppression of people with Asperger's or anything.<p>In summary, I think you have a highly mistaken impression of ""normal"" people and ""normal"" society. More importantly, I think you should realise that no sensible person thinks that the best way to go through life is to pretend not to be yourself - whether you're ""normal"" or not. If I was talking to someone with Asperger's, I would never say ""pretend to be XYZ."" I would try and help them explain some of the social cues and reasoning that might make their life difficult in the absence of understanding. But hell, if you feel angry or reclusive, then be angry or reclusive. If you don't care about what someone is saying, don't pretend to. That's how normal people work, I swear. They just act as they feel.<p>The only caveat is, just as no one should expect you to pretend to be a certain way, don't expect anyone to pretend to like the way you interact with them. If someone is upset about something and you laugh or respond flippantly or dismissively, it is their right to not like your response, and their right to avoid showing such feelings to you in the future, and their right to avoid being around you. Honesty cuts both ways.",1350178821

Yeah, I'm familiar with the topic.<p>I think the article's author's central premise (to paraphrase: that Ada Lovelace is a phony promoted by other rank phonies for [unexplained, mostly inscrutable but surely, somehow base] political and/or emotional warm-fuzzies) is 110%, really pretty low-grade, claptrap.<p>Consider the question of Lovelace's role in CS ...<p>From the perspective of the author of the Ada language[1], call him Jean: he probably must have had some kind of psychic crush on her, right?  Any of us (males, I mean) might assume.<p>From the perspective of later 20th century CS historians, who presumably bestowed the title ""first programmer"": 
Babbage was a hardware engineer; of course he designed the assembly language, in tandem with designing the machine; but since the dawn of computing, and still today, there exists a decided, if fuzzy line, between hardware and software ""engineers'.  
And Lovelace owns the innovation of considering numbers as representations of any possible discrete item beyond mere numbers (hm, maybe Leibnitz did this earlier, but that really doesn't count, does it?[2]), which is /key/.  
So, call them, respectively, first hardware architect, first software programmer.  Fair enough?<p>I think we can definitively settle the question with a time machine - I presume that Charles and Ada would be quite pleased to discuss all such trivia over tea with an esteemed time-traveller.  -- Now you have a new, better project that trolling HN threads (jk ;-P).<p>And no, he referenced nowhere near enough original sources to seem even vaguely credible on such a complex, controversial topic.

Bishop was skeptical as it was different from results he had seen, but when asked for more details, Boaler claimed she had to promise the schools anonymity to do the studies and thus the data could not be verified. This claim of anonymity of the school being necessary doesn't make a lot of sense. Anonymity for the students of course, but there is no reason for the schools not to be identified if the study is legit. Bishop's questioning the legitimacy of Boaler's results because of her refusal to publish anything that would enable verification of her remarkable results resulted in her filing harassment complaints against Bishop, a professor at a totally different university. Later Boaler filed complaints that Bishop was ""a terrorist"", resulting in him being interrogated by police.<p>He then went and found the identity of the school himself and it turned out that the school went from API 3-6 results to the worst possible result, API 1-1 subsequent to the adoption of Boaler's advocated curriculum, something completely the opposite of her claimed findings. <i>If</i> this is true that this is the same school, then she is clearly engaged in fraud, academic misconduct, stalking, and making false police reports, and is not the victim in this at all, but is actually engaging in conduct bordering on the criminal. If on the other hand this is not the school, the school should be identified so that the claims of significant improvement can be verified. The claim that the school needs anonymity can not be taken seriously.",1350177235

Occasionally there are clear choices regarding what is better, but most of the time, there are trade-offs.
