4653039,comment,4647554,4650217,2,0,ivankirigin,,,"Yes, there are many reasons besides growth. For example: for gay marriage, for closing gitmo, for pulling out sooner from Afghanistan, etc.<p>These aren't small issues. They are reasons people vote the way they do. They have nothing to do with growth.<p>Also, just because you've run a successful investment firm or company, doesn't mean you understand well the government's role in creating or hindering growth. I consider those pretty different skill sets.<p>Also, the issues that are commonly identified as problems for growth in our industry aren't being addressed by either candidate. These include immigration reform, patent reform, copyright reform, updating regulations around privacy and health records, etc.<p>Also, those that are already rich have a smaller marginal utility for money, and don't personally care as much about taxes. As an illustrative example, for me personally, a lower cap gains rate directly translates to more angel investing.<p>The common mistaken opposition to low cap gains is that tax rates don't motivate people. The real reason to support low rates is how the increased return would be re-invested. This yields yet another idea no one is proposing: lowering income taxes to match cap gains rates (as opposed to the more common reverse to close the gap).<p>Finally, presidents don't really drive growth, so the entire premiss of your question is incorrect imho.",1350259149

What this illustrates is the dangerous precipice that the world of blogging is hanging on to, where the violent hatred that spews forth when anyone writes a remotely controversial opinion threatens to silence any opinion that sways too far from mainstream consciousness.<p>The fact that the first comment that was posted here was just more critique about the original blog post and how supposedly ""wrong"" it was illustrates how much of a problem this has become. Whether or not his opinion is wrong <i>doesn't matter</i>. What matters is that he expresses it as an alternative <i>perspective</i> to mainstream conciousness.<p>Problems are solved and society is moved forward by a multitude of various opinions, all right and wrong in their own ways, interacting with each other. Each perspective provides a unique method of solving a problem which may not yet exist. The more perspectives we have, the more ideas we have to work from when we try to solve a problem.<p>By violently critiquing such controversial stances, we are indirectly silencing those voices, and ultimately destroying our own ability to find progressively better solutions to problems, because we get stuck inside a single point of view and refuse to move outside of it. It is not simply a matter of ignoring trolls either, because many of the most hurtful comments, at least in my experience, are otherwise highly intelligent people who completely missed the point of what you were trying to say, and have spent 10 minutes writing a scathing critique against a nonexistent problem.<p>If we continue to censor ourselves, it will destroy us.<p><i>""I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."" - Voltaire</i>",1350258590

So according to most physicists, true freefall would only exist in a vacuum.<p>If you don't consider air resistance to be a ""force besides gravity,"" then it becomes a somewhat semantical question of where you draw the line of ""apparatus intended to slow the fall."" In your statement above, what does ""you"" mean?<p>Even without a drogue, your vertical speed can be influenced by such subtleties as what you're wearing. If I wear a zero-porosity nylon jumpsuit and fly on my belly, I'll fall at roughly 120mph. If I fly in baggier clothes, or throw on a sweatshirt over that jumpsuit, I can slow to 115mph. If I'm wearing a heavier rig with a bigger parachute in it, my rate of speed will increase. You get the idea.<p>So again, semantically, if we ignore the fact that air resistance is a force besides gravity, would the only way to achieve freefall be to jump from an aircraft naked, wearing no parachute?<p>Ultimately, no matter what you're wearing, terminal velocity is different for every person or object falling through the atmosphere. It's the sum total of gravity and drag, semantics or not. :)",1350258481

However, it's going to get harder with each passing day to ""prove"" specific forms of technology[1] generate Y jobs for reasons that you expressed in the article. For that reason, I think it's likely better to try to sidestep the argument altogether and explain why it's asking the wrong question instead of first providing a direct answer to the question/argument.<p>I did re-read the article after making the first comment, and I admit I had concentrated on the first half of it a little more than the second half where you do address some of my concerns.<p>[1] Technology in general isn't under attack here, it's generally only technology created in the last X years.

4652957,comment,4652827,4652827,5,0,jfaucett,,,"well, I did manage to get through the post, and this is obviously someone deeply offended, so I made myself get through it. Then I went on to read antirez's and comments. Here's my thoughts.<p>According to one of antirez's comment responses: ""the root of the problem  is equal dignity of individuals"". and the only way to change this is by ""(showing) our children that we don't have any sexual bias, they'll observe us, and will act accordingly (even in this case talking will help marginally if they can't see we act well)"".<p>And generally if you read his article you get the overal impression (at least I did) that he is against protection of minorites when the language is formulated in specific terms (ie. such and such policy for women, or for irish men or whatever). He advocates always formulating the language in general terms such as ""Why is A not payed like B even if they have similar responsibilities and tasks."" and going from there.<p>As pointed out by author at prettylittlemachine, many of his formulations are not well put, for example, when antirez writes ""Talking with my female coworkers I discovered they were deeply upset and offended by other women that were too easy to ask for respect using sexism as a flag."" she responds by saying ""Ah, right. The problem is actually THE WOMEN IN THE WORKPLACE!!!""<p>Again she quotes antirez saying ""Similarly, I will not care who you are if you do something silly at work. Nothing is more offensive for you than me being too easy with you because you are part of some minority. "", and responds by saying ""Here again, the theme that women are going to get off too easily when they fuck up in the workplace because they are women.""<p>in summary, for me I'll have to think about this subject a little while to formulate a solid opinion on it, but initially, I tend to agree with what I think is antirez's view that the idea we should espouse is mutual respect and equal rights for all individuals. There's no need to add adjectives or specify types of individuals men,women, caucasians, etc, I think if we have that mindset our children will have it too and maybe the issues will fall away, they are cultural after all.<p>EDIT: here's antirez's twitter where he clarifies and you can see others reactions as well: <a href=""https://twitter.com/antirez"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/antirez</a>",1350257028

Pretty much all the English translations are based off of Moncrieff's work.<p>There's also a new re-translation being done by Penguin; only the first four are out, the rest are supposed to be out in 2018(?).
