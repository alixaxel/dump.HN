4650446,comment,4649308,4650424,0,0,Cyaegha,,,"You state that:<p><i>A lattice is a partial ordering with a single unique ""top element"" (least upper bound) and a single unique ""bottom element"" (greatest lower bound). Every node in the lattice is reachable by following some directed path from the single least upper bound, and there is a directed path from every node in the lattice to the single least lower bound.</i><p>A lattice is a poset where binary joins and meets exist. You define a bounded poset not a lattice. In general a lattice need not have either a top element or a bottom element, although all finite lattices are complete and thus do have top and bottom elements. The second sentence is also redundant, because for any element x of a lattice x  , so why talk about paths?",1350183558

In addition to it no longer being my main focus (for good or ill), I have chronic fatigue syndrome. If I work a 30-hour week, that's extraordinarily high output for me.<p>How many blog posts?

Unfortunately the facts are not on your side, so leading questions it is, I suppose.<p>Interesting that you & the other newbie HN user have ways to ""counter"" every argument.

This is the second alternative to setting the current value of a variable presented in Flow (specifically, recurrence relations, e.g. x' = x + 1, which are syntactic sugar but allow ""variable assignment"" but only allow assignment to variables accessible in the next loop iteration).

I'm not sure I need a book to do that, and you haven't sold me on the examples, anecdotes, worksheets, and other practical advice.  I think it really, singly comes down to just raising your rate -- am I wrong?<p>Quite frankly, the reason I haven't raised my rate is that I live a comfortable lifestyle.  I can afford the things I need and the things I desire.  I have a family - I provide well, and we are far ahead of the curve on retirement.  I plan to retire early, and I'm on track for that.  I also live in a geographic environment that has been hit significantly hard economically.  Doubling my rate would be a hard pill to swallow for local clients -- albeit most of my clients have been on the coasts.<p>The question I raised, and still do raise, is this: is it really an ebook that made you that extra income, or is it just having the balls to raise your rate?

It really is a literature review, but many of the references I turned up are strangely ominous, discussing ""mass psychogenic illness"", violence in the parking lot of Taco Bell, and other such things. Thus, I weave them into a Lovecraftian hypothesis, which proposes that there is a hidden evil at the heart of tacology, which leads academics to study tacos and burritos only superficially, shrinking back at the instant they realize they have delved too deeply.",1350183123

4650431,comment,4649308,4649308,5,0,ismarc,,,"For a while, I've been pondering how to solve the same problem.  I also reached similar conclusions, that parallelism needs to be implicit at the language level.  I've even been working on an implementation that will run on the JVM (it's all of a week old for writing code for it, but I've been documenting the how it works for months in my notebooks).  The language is based around the idea of stream processing.  By using type signatures, function calls can be  parallelized based on how the are called.<p>As an example, given two functions, A(Item) and B(List[Item]), if you call them like:<p><pre><code>    B << A << List[Item](x,y,z)\n</code></pre>\nthe A should be called once for each item in the list of x,y,z, the results of which are collected into a list and passed to B.  If you add in a function C(Item) and call it like:<p><pre><code>    B << C << A << List[Item](x,y,z)\n</code></pre>\nthen at any given point, A can be processing a list item, C can be processing a list item and the total results of C are being collected.  Which leads into, what if it is order dependent?<p><pre><code>    B << serial { A << List[Item](x,y,z) }\n</code></pre>\nwill guarantee that A is called serially and the order of the List (and results) is preserved.<p>I really shouldn't advertise the link to the language at all here, considering I have zero documentation and there's almost no comments in the current code, but I'm going to anyways, <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/ismarc/muster"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/ismarc/muster</a> .  It currently will parse a single file, generate the AST and generate the symbol table.  I'm working on a non-parallel interpreter right now, with the intention of using the interpreter to write the compiler so the language is fully exercised to work out any potential issues with it.  And on a final note, I'm targeting the JVM mainly for existing libraries, but I'm open to discussions about it.",1350182922

The USPS needs to shrink, as over 40% of their business is <delivering junk mail>[1].  That was their latest ""growth"" initiative.  Now they overexpanded their overhead, and are facing cuts.  New services (not junk) should be added to replace declining 1st class, but the USPS needs to be radically re-scalled and made efficient.  This does no mean closing branches, it means cutting overhead.  US taxpayers should be subsisizing a communications infrastructure, not be subsidizing a direct-marketing operation.<p>________________<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_mail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advertising_mail</a>",1350182897

I suspect that everyone would agree that this is not an casual relationship, which would imply that the children did better because they waited for the marshmallow. Therefore, we know that we are looking for what factor(s) lead to the correlation between waiting and success in life. In the original experiment it was assumed, I believe without justification, that the common cause was impulse control. This experiment shows that the trustworthiness of the environment plays a significant role in determining how the children make their decision. This result support the hypothesis that the original marshmallow experiment was a proxy for the living environment of the children, not their impulse control. I'll leave it up to researchers to determine how to answer the question of what is going on behind the scenes, however I think the take home message for the rest of us is that experiments and statistics only prove exactly what was being looked at, and any conclusion we draw from that is interperatation that is subject to human error.",1350181751

If their conclusion is accurate, that children are rational actors in the face of uncertainty (that is, if the children asses that future rewards are more or less likely to happen based on their assessment of the other adults in the children's life) - then what I'm suggesting is that the original study had a group of rational players, and what the scientists were measuring, wasn't impulse control of the children (which I'm suggesting might be innately consistent across the group, or at least not revealed in this study) - but instead, was identifying how reliable the guardians and adults in these children's life were.  It stands to reason, that children growing up in stable households, would have a better chance of being prosperous in life, than those who grew up in unstable, unreliable homes.",1350181323

(I study CS and currently have very little background in physics and electrical engineering.)<p>Over the past few years I've read engineers talk about the manufacture and design of CPUs in terms of an XX nanometer processes, where XX is some ever smaller integer - presumably representing the density of transistors in the CPU, or something proportional to that.<p>But for many decades, we've known that there are fundamental physical limits of computation as-we-know-it with Moore's law predicting a smooth logarithmic curve until that point, doubling every 18 months.<p>My question is why does it have to be a smooth increase? Don't we have enough computation and understanding now to leapfrog straight to the physical limits using standard run-of-the-mill CPU architecture? After all we can manipulate individual atoms and I think we have transistors made of a just few atoms or less.<p>Why do we have to go through the 20 nanometer processes then presumably through the picometers until finally stopping at some point maybe in the femtometers (where the lengths of many atomic nuclei can be expressed in single digit integers). Development that Moore's Law presumably predicts will take multiple decades to reach.<p>Why can't we build processors using modern CPU paradigms on the atomic scale earlier? Is it mass-production issues? Or some physical bottlenecks? Do we need to continually develop ever slightly more dense processors at great expense slowly or can we skip the interval and develop straight at the atomic scale?<p>I just feel like at some point there should be step function straight to the physical limits of processors as-we-know-them.

But true marketing, as a discipline, is very much product focused.<p>In fact, the discipline is often said to encompass ""Four P's"": product, price, place, and promotion. Many people -- not just in the tech world, to be fair -- tend to conflate the ""promotion"" function (advertising, communications, messaging) with marketing in general. In fact, promotion is just a subset of marketing. It's an important subset, but it's a subset nonetheless.<p>The best marketers are well grounded in, and can draw upon, the full-spectrum marketing skill set. Finding one of these marketers can actually be very valuable to your company. Having this full skill set can be very valuable to <i>you</i>, whether you're a technical or non-technical founder.<p>[A (hopefully) interesting side note: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix</a>]",1350180212
