Marginal cost is near zero compared to development cost.<p>In neither case do you necessarily have fantastic profits although if you can sell at scale at a good price it becomes very likely but if you have a drug for a niche market or software in a crowded market it is quite possible to make a loss.<p>This is neither an argument for or against the patent abolition proposition which I am torn on.

Google knows my calendar, Google knows my contacts, Google knows pretty much everything I buy online (because they handle all my emails), Google knows about my travel plans (email again), Google know what I've been looking, where I've been (Latitude) and so on.<p>There could be also huge opportunities for money making in all this. One good question is should they keep all this just to themselves or would it be better to try to create an ecosystem for applications.<p>Let's the take travel plans as an example. It would be fairly easy for Google to mine my calendar and emails to figure out my travel plans. This would open up opportunities in offering me flight upgrades and other travel related services. Google could either try to use this information themselves, they could allow advertisers to use it, or they could expose it to 3rd party apps (of course with my consent). Keeping with the agent idea these things would be much more than just highly targeted ads. They could be direct offers, like ""Say Yes Please, to upgrade your flight from Helsinki to Barcelona to business class for 150"".",1348991142

If people are sick and dying, they have bottomless motivation.<p>Yes, but they <i>don't</i> have bottomless wallets.  I'm sure a great deal of research would still happen in the absence of large potential profits.  The problem is very little of it would lead to drugs your doctor could prescribe.  The drug targets are the easy part - the hard part is getting a compound through clinical trials, and ones you get approved has to pay for the other 90% that didn't make it because they were too toxic or didn't work as well as existing treatments.<p>As a real-world case consider antibiotics.  There's a huge need for new antibiotics - if you get the right strain of MRSA your doctor is going to be about as useful as the local faith healer.  Same goes for a nasty strain of the clap that's making the rounds in Japan.  Totally resistant to existing antibiotics - once you get it, it's not going away.<p>But for various reasons there's no money in antibiotics (or vaccines, either, but let's just stick with antibiotics).  You don't get repeat customers, and the bugs will start to develop resistance in a few years.  With no profit motive drug companies aren't doing what they need to do to bring new antibiotics to market.  So there's nothing in the pipeline.<p>The concern, of course, is that if you did away with patents entirely <i>every</i> type of drug would be like antibiotics.  Drug companies wouldn't exist at all, or they'd exist as contractors to governments (oh, and wouldn't <i>that</i> be efficient).",1348991069

My family lives here, and working remotely means I can see my friends and family in the evenings and on weekends, and not use up my vacation time while they're at work anyway. A month is long enough that I can work around other people's schedules to catch up, go away for a weekend with someone, etc instead of being all 'drop everything, I'm visiting!'. It's inconvenient being 18 hours off the home timezone, but it's not that bad and I would (will) do it again. The restrictions on communication have caused some trouble but mostly exposed holes where people aren't using expected status tools to keep records up to date, which is good to know anyway.

I didn't have any previous carpentry experience, so I just nailed six wooden legs to a 1.5 x 4 feet board - it was basically a coffee table that I put on top of my existing table at work.

Coming up with an effective single-sentence explanation of your product will affect your conversion more than anything else. I dont think youve quite nailed it with An app for you and your campus. Figure out what the most compelling use-case of your product is and make that clear on your landing page.<p>2.	Make sure your landing page looks great on mobile browsers (especially since yours is a mobile product). Right now, on Safari on my iPhone, I dont even see the map.<p>3.	I would get rid of Exclusively at Stanford University, since I think it will turn off people from other schools. You should experiment with removing it or even better, showing it only if the IP of the person clicking the ad is in the Bay Area.<p>4.	I would get rid of the What do you want to shoutt about? I think for most people using these kinds of apps for the first few times, they start of as consumers of info/content and you later have to convert them to producers of content. Your value prop with What do you want to shout about? here is all about the producer side, and I think that may not be as appealing for brand new users. Look at Twitter for example. Their landing page is all about the consumer value prop, and doesnt mention the sharing aspect (Find out whats happening, right now, with the people and organizations you care about.)<p>5.	A launch date and countdown would be awesome.<p>6.	Get people to connect their FB accounts instead of \njust giving you their email. This way you could potentially send them FB notifications as well when you launch.<p>7.	Try putting your messaging front and center instead of to the bottom left. We got great results with this.<p>8.	Experiment, experiment, experiment. Anything I or anyone else here may tell you would just be intelligent guesses at what we think will work. Youll get way better results from doing some quick A/B tests. We went from about 7% conversion to our landing page to about 55% conversion just by running a series of A/B tests.<p>Good luck!",1348990544

There are many reasons why an airplane can be unsafe to fly, and it's not always possible to prevent these incidents from happening, even with good maintenance. The best that can be done is  thorough preflight checks while on the ground, and an emergency landing if issues crop up while airborne, however slight.<p>I'll concede that American Airlines could have treated its customers with more courtesy, offering them food and drink. It's certainly possible that American could have performed better maintenance on their planes.
