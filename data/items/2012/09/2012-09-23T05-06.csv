The ability of the product to go viral within the account. Essentially, it becomes the same process as a consumer sale with the one additional step of getting approved to sell into that batch of consumers.<p>While that might seem to be a big negative against starting an enterprise business, the advantage is that you're then convincing people to spend someone else's money which is easier than convincing them to spend their own.

Would you be willing to honestly critique a bad teacher if it meant you would have to deal with them actually doing their job for the next few months?<p>I'm also not so sure that everyone would be so willing to honestly critique their teachers at the end of the year, either. A lot of kids come to like their ""bad teachers who lead fun classes"" almost as much or more than the teachers who do their jobs well. Kind of like how many kids are unwilling to ""snitch"" on kids who have wronged them, even when guaranteed anonymity, I think a lot of them wouldn't want to get their teachers in trouble, even if they weren't doing their job properly. In my experience with such teachers, even poorly behaved students would act extremely respectfully when the principal came around to observe. Then again, maybe they were just afraid of getting on the teacher's bad side.<p>Even worse are instances where the administration knows fully well that a teacher leads a ""joke class"" and keeps them around to funnel the ""bad kids"" into. I grew up in a school system that straddled the border between a middle class college town and Section 8 housing packed with families ruined by the collapse of unskilled industrial labor in the area. I have no doubt that a large number of the elective courses existed solely to fill credits for disruptive students and keep them from causing problems in the ""real classes"" that the middle class and brighter/better-adjusted lower class students took. It didn't matter if the class actually learned anything, the school was just desperate to raise their graduation rates.<p>I do think these evaluations can help good teachers improve and possibly help to identify people who don't deserve to work as teachers, but they can't solve fundamental problems like ""the early education and home environment of these students has failed them, and now the administration of their high school is ready to roll over to keep them from dropping out.""",1348378022

However, Ubuntu would have to charge quite a bit of money in order to make even remotely as much per user as Apple is making by being a high-margin hardware company (where the OS is almost nothing more to them than an incentive to buy more hardware).<p>Even so, I'd happily pay for that as well; but, I can't, as Ubuntu won't take my money [1]: they don't sell anything I can actually buy; AFAIK, the only thing they accept money for is sending people to my business to give talks about how to better use Ubuntu.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/why-is-it-free"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/why-is-it-free</a><p>Now, that said, a lot of the value that Ubuntu brings to the table is actually thanks to the people working on Debian: Ubuntu just takes their packages. I would also quite happily pay for things from Debian; I'd probably be even happier doing so than paying for things from Ubuntu.<p>However, they also do not charge for things, so I cannot pay them for things. I can donate money to them[2], but now we are talking about something much more complex (involving physical mail and checks or money orders) at a much higher mental cost of deciding ""well, now how much?"".<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.spi-inc.org/donations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spi-inc.org/donations/</a><p>I personally don't even think that I'm rare: a lot of people are quite happy to pay for things that provide them value, and Ubuntu is not just helping me personally, it helps my business. I run all of my servers using Ubuntu: I'm paying Amazon to run the machines, I'd happily pay Ubuntu for the software.<p>I thereby don't think it is quite fair to put the blame for this on the ""very few hackers [that/which/whom/omgdunno] are willing to put their money where their mouths are"": Ubuntu is much like the business that is undercharging for their services, and thereby cannot satisfy the customer [3].<p>[3] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4555062"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4555062</a><p>(Though, I can totally see the argument that the reason that they are able to even do what they do is that they do not charge: that if they charged there would be tons of internal community arguments about what the money was for and who would get it; or, quite simply, the direct monetization could undermine the charitable aspects.)",1348377910
