It's just a childish phrase used to indicate dislike for something.

Something like a stream of one million continuous JSTOR downloads 24/7, significantly impacting the entire MIT network, is going to go unnoticed?<p>His JSTOR use was heavy enough to draw an IP ban.  Yet he continued.  I fail to believe he was really trying to hide - he knew his actions would be noticed.  Network admins would see what was going on.  And even in the wiring closet, putting a bike helmet over his face?  That's not exactly covert.<p>JSTOR would know something was up - the IP ban was probably automatic but still I would guess the folks administering their servers would have noticed a huge spike in activity from MIT.<p>MIT would know something was up.  Their network admins are not asleep at the wheel.<p>Seems to me, it was no secret what he was doing.  He did not try very hard to conceal it.  (Or maybe you think he was supposed to hold a press conference or at least call the TV news first?)  With the way he went about this, it's no wonder he got caught.<p>Moreover, he already knew he had an FBI file from the PACER incident.

I need to consume a number of domain specific java libraries, and the native support for logic programming with core.logic and datalog is a big win. Clojure certainly wasn't the easiest choice - I would be much further ahead if I started with Ruby.<p>> Clojure to me seems like a language culture that would likely tend towards smaller libraries that do specific things than something with batteries included and such like Rails.<p>I should clarify that I think Clojure's favouring of smaller composable libraries is ultimately a better approach than the monolithic framework.

For classification you can build a program that searches for a program that best uses the input to predicts classes. I <i>have</i> done this (there are better heuristics than the old kind that lead to really big dumb programs). Or you can combine boosting with Genetic Programming or you can use them in Learning Classifier Systems.

(at least as far as your HN comments go)<p>Just go back and reread any thread of yours regarding TLS versus designing new protocols.  The liberal cryptographers will design dozens of protocol implementations with starry-eyed visions of new unformalized properties that don't actually exist. Most will be used in places where TLS would have sufficed and most of them will be broken. But eventually <i>something</i> new will come out this mess, provide enough advantages to gain traction, and become hardened canon over the years. Conservative philosophy will never design a crypto protocol, but it will prevent a lot of damage from the redundant badly-designed protocols. Both philosophies are needed.<p>One could be both liberal and conservative in different areas, but your non-technical comments read the same way. Or perhaps you're just a bit confused about what conservatism actually is. Totally reasonable given the shifty name calling that masquerades as political ""debate"".
