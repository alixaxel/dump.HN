Today I am into the Total War series, the latest being Shogun 2.<p>I love Starcraft 2 as well, and play it occasionally. In Starcraft however you're forever stuck in skirmish mode; there's no possibility of conquering a whole country in a very long campaign like in Total War or Lords of the Realm, and developing your nation into an economic powerhouse on the way there.",1347159589

If you live in the house of someone who was formerly a heavy smoker then you have a higher cancer risk yourself, because the radiation from the cigarrettes gets into the walls and carpet. Which means that smokers themselves also have a lower cancer risk if they smoke outside for the same reason. I'd imagine it also somewhat reduces their risk for heart attack, since second hand smoke increases your risk of heart attack, although I haven't seen any stats on that.",1347159285

You cut the deck in half and distribute one half to Bob and keep the other half (such that by knowing one half, you would know the other). Until either of you look at your respective half-deck, the distribution of cards is in a superposition of all possible distributions (a la Schrodinger's cat). Where the analogy breaks down (thereby illustration what's special about Quantum Teleportation), is that as soon as Alice flips her cards, Bob's cards flip as well (and visa versa). Thus by the time the cards got to Bob, Bob would be able to detect that someone else could have read the cards and thus the information may have been compromised.  (This is kind of how I remember quantum cryptography to work, actually).<p>Does this analogy make sense? My physics background is pretty weak...",1347159013

For readers who don't read much science journalism, the op-ed piece needs to be taken with a grain of salt, and I agree with the author of the linked article that the present state of our understanding of autism is a great deal less certain than the statement ""An Immune Disorder at the Root of Autism"", as though a consensus has been reached. No such consensus exists or is imminent.<p>An example of the kind of argument in the article is this: ""One large Danish study, which included nearly 700,000 births over a decade, found that a mothers rheumatoid arthritis, a degenerative disease of the joints, <i>elevated</i> a childs risk of autism by 80 percent."" (Emphasis added.)<p>The word ""elevated"" sugggests a cause-effect relationship that hasn't been established. It is more accurate to say that there is a correlation between the mother's rheumatoid arthritis and the child's autism. There's no reliable basis for saying that one caused the other.<p>It will be a supreme irony if the present true autism rate is traced to our clean modern world, the world so often praised as self-evidently better than the dirty environment our ancestors lived in. It seems there's a circumstantial association between modern cleanliness and asthma (the so-called ""hygiene hypothesis"").<p>I emphasize that these are conjectures with no solid scientific backing, just like the op-ed piece.",1347158733

For example, javascript is a weakly typed language, because things such as ""a""+1, and Math.floor(""a"") are all valid; while they would result in a type error in python.<p>What makes python seem weakly typed to many people is its implicit variable shadowing. So when you do a=""hello"", a is a str, and can only be used where a str is expected. However, python lets you do:\n>a=""hello""\n>a=1<p>at which point a is shadowed to an int.<p>Dynamic typing has some (not all) of the problems weak typing has, but they are not the same thing",1347158546

Music is classifiable in some sense, but its a hugely complex and multi-directional thing and most 'classifications' really just scratch the surface. And while algorithmic recommendation services (lastfm, spotify, etc.) can be nice for a while, actually people are complex and always change their views and interests, so they are never always going to give you what you want.<p>Personally for my own collection - I have a loosely interpreted directory structure that I've evolved that is basically 'continent and/or genre'/'artist'/'album (with year recorded at the start if I have lots of them)' that works well for me and I don't have to constantly rename everything I download (theres some less-sorted directories of things I don't listen to much within this).<p>For searching, tagging and playing I use foobar2000 (unfortunately still windows-only) because it has plenty plugins which handle everything from tagging (eg. from discogs and freedb), through to searching (keeps a constantly updated and strongly index media library, which can be searched from a range of front-end UIs) and information finding (getting album covers, lyrics, artist biographies, etc. and displaying as you like). I don't do lots of retagging, but I do find it useful sometimes - for instance I have tagged some of my more listened classical music by composer and performer separately, so I can look at it from either direction when I want to.",1347156393

In those situations I'm on there almost constantly. For popular languages like Objective-C for iOS, there are thousands of people who are in that same situation.<p>Surely there must be a way to capture the value-added for all those thousands of people in the reputation system? Many people get to these answers from google, so it sounds like a simple matter of pinging them to (sign-in) and upvote the answer that helped them out.<p>If, on the other hand, as the author says SO is no longer actually values reputation, and is screwing with their algorithms accordingly, that is a serious problem.

Since then, I've done everything wrong.<p>I grew up thinking I'd be a scientist, but dropped out of grad school without useful skills, moved in with family with whom I have an unhealthy relationship, struggled to find non-trivial work, and let my personal relationships languish because I'm ashamed of my life. I've taken some more college courses just to be doing something non-trivial (I've done tutoring/odd jobs), but to little benefit.<p>Since finding HN, I've taught myself (some!) Scheme, C, ASM, Py/JS/Rails, and Haskell, but have no really interesting projects. However, one of the messages of HN is that passion, not foundational knowledge, matters most, but my passions are outside web/mobile, in fields that don't pay (perhaps I misunderstand the ""passionate developer"" trope). Regardless, my rsum makes this a moot point.<p>It's hard to set and work toward short- or long-term goals: I don't know which goals and I'm constantly aware I should be focussing on something with short/medium-term financial potential and by a sense of futility/mental fatigue.<p>I've fallen off the track and don't know how to get back on. But somehow my problem isn't not being able to get a job in some specific field but not knowing how to live. For example, dissatisfaction with my underachievement leads me to isolate myself more (obviously a self-reinforcing problem for which the solution is to <i>be awesome</i>, but it's not working out). Selling anything, particularly myself, is something I'm deeply uncomfortable with, and too often just punted on. This is exascerbated by my current lack of value to offer, but again ... a mutually recursive problem?<p>I'm in reasonable health, live in a first-world country, and some brilliant and talented people (wrongly?) believed in me ... but I couldn't do anything right, and now couldn't even get a job at a burger joint. How can I change my mindset?<p>Thanks.",1347156006
