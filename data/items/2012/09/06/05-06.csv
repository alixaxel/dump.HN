While it is true we cannot understand the genome by ignoring its 3D shape, we also cannot understand the genome without looking at the many other ways the genome is regulated. Nature did not make things simple for us. There are quite a few variables that regulate our genes, and sadly it seems that all or most of these variables must be taken into account",1346911148
4483011,comment,4482934,4482934,4,0,dirtyaura,,,"First, I don't know what your application does, but based on the small yearly price, I assume it isn't super-complicated.  BUT regardless of how simple your application is, you should negotiate a deal that will bring you thousands or tens of thousands over a period of time. They have likely spend some time finding out about possible solution. Thus, they can easily pay a few thousand dollars immediately if it solves their need and more over a period of time.<p>However, don't just negotiate on a single price, but strike a deal where support work will bring you recurring revenue on monthly basis.<p>Try to have several dimensions on which you negotiate, not just the price. You already had a great idea for a negotiation dimension: do you offer it as a white or gray label solution. If they are willing to pay too little, require that your product brand is clearly visible for end users, thus bringing more customers for you in the future. You can negotiate on many things besides the price: the scope of your support, your availability, the response time to support queries, your scalability promise to them, future improvements to product, etc.<p>Good luck!",1346911132

I did cause myself temporary soreness by constantly using Ctrl-Z, Ctrl-X and Ctrl-C by holding Ctrl and doubling my left thumb under my palm. That was the one conscious adjustment (switching to my little finger for Ctrl) I have ever made, and once I started using Mac keyboards (Command instead of Ctrl), I switched back.<p>I'm interested in your editor choice.

4483000,comment,4482823,4482893,6,0,jsz0,,,"<i>Reflashing a phone is scary and weird when you do it the first time, but it's really not hard and the community support is quite good.</i><p>You're right -- it's not hard. Just annoying and possibly risky. A lot of these ROMs are alpha/beta quality and not fully tested. For example I installed a JB ROM on my Galaxy Nexus 4G that broke my GPS. I didn't even realize it until I was lost and needed GPS to find my way back to the highway. Most of these ROMs (none yet?) have OTA updating so once you flash you are committing yourself to maintaining it going forward. So for example if there's some horrible security problem you may never get patched unless you seek it out yourself. This brings up the issue of installing software from untrusted sources. Cyanogenmod is fine but what about all the others? Call me old fashion but I don't enjoy flashing random ROMS I find on web forums. Seems like that could end really poorly.<p>The final annoyance that gets me every time is these different ROM releases often require you to wipe system data. So you have to use something like Titanium Backup, which has a UI similar to the cockpit of a 747, to back things up yourself. On my first attempt to do this I accidentally restored 'system data' or something like that which borked my phone up really well. I had to repeat the whole process of wiping and starting over. The other gripe is when TB reinstalls apps you have to sit there and hit install/done about a million times.<p>Even as a technical user I just don't want to deal with it but I still do want the latest OS release. I even foolishly bought a Galaxy Nexus thinking I wouldn't have to deal with it anymore but I didn't buy the right Galaxy Nexus that gets updates from Google. Silly me.",1346910849

Here are some tips based on my experience and fairly extensive research, including many conversations with doctors and chiropractors.<p>* Use a REAL ergonomic keyboard, such as the SafeType (<a href=""http://safetype.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://safetype.com/</a>), which addresses 3 major causes of wrist pain: extension, deviation, and pronation. The slanted keyboards, such as the one mentioned in the article do not really help all that much, as they do not properly address the 3 major causes.<p>* Work standing up. This contributes to better blood flow, and improved posture, which can alleviate RSI.<p>* Decrease caffeine consumption.<p>* Decrease alcohol consumption.<p>* Get proper sleep<p>* Eat healthy.

Nokia is bringing real innovation to the mobile market and unlike most android releases I see, it actually pairs it with awesome device design. I can just imagine the video accompanying the release of the new iPhone in a few days:<p>""We added an all new <i>faster</i> processor (the change won't even be noticeable but we will pay through the roof for it). It's running a <i>new</i> version of iOS (that is already old). We <i>redesigned</i> the fan to make it 2dB quiter (it wasn't loud to begin with but ok). We <i>changed</i> the connecting cable (so our old ones don't work then?). We made the screen even <i>bigger</i> (awesome, devs need to adjust their old apps for a new aspect ratio). We even <i>added</i> 4G (only the last company to do it). It's the best iPhone yet!""<p>Of course, people will still hail that announcement as some sort of revolution. Nokia may have bs'd their ad but I can't help but ignore it and hope people see that these features are really quite cool without being exaggerated. It's refreshing to not <i>only</i> hear about screen size or processor speed in a new phone but also: a new photo technology, a more clear screen you can use gloves on, wireless charging, and a music functionality that seems a lot like a Nexus Q...<p>If people didn't have their brand loyalties - any sensible person would realize how fucking awesome that list is. I still could be very likely getting an iPhone when it comes out but considering Apple literally hasn't done anything moderately interesting since Jobs died (besides troll Samsung), I can't imagine it's long before their stagnant innovation catches up to them. When the day comes that buying the phone with the best experience doesn't mean supporting a joke of a company, I'm going to be a really happy dude.",1346910262
4482985,comment,4471030,4477990,1,0,IceCreamYou,,,"There are a lot of different situations. Some common ones:<p>1) When people come to me and say ""I need someone to build X for me,"" I usually say ""I can help you make sure X gets done right."" If the person contacting me isn't especially technical, that means I remove the weight from their shoulders of verifying that they actually got what they paid for when they hire another freelancer/contractor to do the job.<p>2) Sometimes people already have devs either hired internally or managed externally, and they're having trouble and just need someone to come in and tell them how to get back on track. This might involve some code but it wouldn't actually be my job to write the code, just more of a training thing / someone to call.<p>3) Sometimes startups with non-technical founders in particular just need guidance on what they should actually be doing with technology. They don't know how it could improve their business, but they do know that they like what my software says it can do, and they're not sure what to do next. Usually these people are trying to compensate for a lack of a technical co-founder.<p>4) A lot of the time the initial email to me isn't looking for a consultant, and the business may not even have considered the idea; but sometimes especially larger institutions know that they want a consultant with intimate knowledge of the software they're working with. You can't get that by hiring a consulting firm.<p>Transitioning was easy -- I just started telling people I would do consulting instead of development work when they contacted me. I had intentionally not take development work that involved maintenance agreements for some time (I rarely built complete sites; I just built components or additions to my own open-source software). It also helped that I had spent a lot of time meeting with entrepreneurs and hearing about the businesses of people who had previously hired me. But there is a lot to know about consulting just like there is a lot to know about development and it takes some research and experimenting to deliver good experiences.",1346910096

The cool thing for me was the realization that when DNA is coiled, parts of the strand that are linearly very far apart end up adjacent in the coil. And further, that adjacency affects how the gene expresses proteins. That means that you not only need a decoded genome, you need to understand the relationship of the segments in 3D. For me at least it feels a lot more reasonable than the original numbers of genes. At least in terms of describing humans, as diverse and complex as we are.<p>Someone of course will do the same for chimps and bonobos, and then we'll know which of the switches are important as well as the genes.
