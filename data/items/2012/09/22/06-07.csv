4557303,comment,4555825,4555825,1,0,alid,,,"It's a cluttered market, yes, but I still believe there's large-scale untapped potential! I think a segue into 'knowledge management' rather than pure CRM could yield results - I used to work in corporate strategy for a global financial firm, and my takeout was that in many large corporations sales and marketing teams have their particular CRM systems in place but it's not integrated or accessible throughout the company (cue lots of missed opportunities). I see a big need in the corporate world for integrated, enterprise-wide metrics - CRM, but also sales, marketing activities, strategic priorities, financial metricsall in the one system. It seems basic, but believe me for many large companies 'knowledge management' consists of Powerpoint and Excel docs, and version control is a nightmare. (They talk about Enterprise 2.0 but frankly it hasn't hit any of the firms I've had dealings with). I'd like to see company position snapshots at the click of a button - pull up sales for the last month, overlay with conversion rates, overlay with marketing activities, and overlay again with financial info. This level of transparency is completely lost in large firms and re-enforces a 'silo' company culture. Happy to chat further about it if you're keen, I toyed with a business plan around this before switching to my current startup.",1348296882

A FactoryBean allows you to construct complex objects, or construct objects Spring can't easily create itself (e.g. JndiFactoryBean). A ProxyFactoryBean builds Spring AOP proxy  beans.<p>As it turns out, there was no need for the class as it has been deprecated. However, providing an abstract singleton scoped proxy factory bean is indeed convenient. If there was a need for a factory that creates AOP proxies then it would be very useful to have an abstract class that implements most of the methods for you, and create them with singleton scope. In that case, AbstractSingletonProxyFactoryBean is sensible.<p>It's a corner case. It was used by one class, but that was deprecated later, so this was deprecated as there wasn't really a need for the convenience class.<p>I take this lot of stuff seriously because I see a lot of ignorant pattern bashing by those who haven't taken the time to understand why patterns are very useful and potentially can make OOP code cleaner and easier to maintain.",1348293904
