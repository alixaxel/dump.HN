The desire to migrate and live and work in different places around the world should need no greater justification than mere idle curiousity and I believe that the current approach to state borders does nothing but stoke xenophobia and mistrust around the world.<p>Also, I come from the UK, which has more UK citizens working abroad than foreign citizens working here, all while some sections of the press runs stories about how foreign workers are crowding people out of jobs. I keep trying to ask people who support banning all foreign labour, what they think will happen when everywhere else bans UK labour from their countries in return and all those UK expat workers, with their wealth of experience, come flooding back in greater numbers than the foreign workers that have just been kicked out, so leading to even greater unemployment, while at the same time guaranteeing that nobody would really want to trade with us anymore.

And what metrics?  You just listed a ton of caveats and then said that it's ""worthy"" based on unnamed metrics.<p>No, the iPhone doesn't ""stack up"", nor should it.  It's a camera phone compared to a very high-end DSLR.  It falls far short of the DSLR in image quality metrics.  The images are noisy.  They aren't sharp.  There's glare galore.  And that's okay, because it's a camera phone, and the primary use case is snapping photos of friends to upload to Facebook or show other friends at the bar.<p>The fact that it meets your needs doesn't mean it ""stacks up"", though, any more than a Honda Civic ""stacks up"" against a Ferrari.

Except in the poorest slums, where people can't afford soap.<p>If fact, they may be <i>wasting</i> their money on stuff which <i>increases</i> infant mortality. Infant formula may be marketed as being healthier than mother's milk, but without proper sanitation it's much worse.<p>> Children die because, almost universally, someone has strangled the market that would otherwise be allocating soap towards their rooms.<p>It's ridiculous to say that, unless you know of some place in the world where soap is insanely expensive. They'll die because their families were poor. The ultimate causes of poverty are complex, and probably relate to dysfunctional states which (among other things) don't create functional markets. But to say that the ultimate problem is ""not enough markets"" is silly. Would public education help? Does their government need to enforce anti-corruption laws?<p>You can't look at a government which does <i>everything</i> wrong, and say ""the big problem is, they don't allow markets to flourish"".<p>But some things (like immunization) can be done cheaply (if somewhat inefficiently) by something that's not a market.",1348284925
4557042,comment,4552914,4553617,1,0,fawce,,,"I agree with a lot of what you say, but I think it is important to point out that algorithms can invest too. They don't only trade. Anytime you use software to buy or sell securities, people assume it is technical trading, or worse, high-frequency trading. The truth is there aren't enough people working on making algorithms that invest rather than trade, because the ROI for trading is more apparent.<p>I work at Quantopian, and our goal is to make it possible for more people to explore algorithmic investing. I agree the social utility of from increasing liquidity from current levels is at best diminishing returns, but algorithms could bring the same drop in costs and increase in quality for money management that it brought to trading. That's a benefit to individuals, pension funds, charitable endowments, and anyone else that has to save and plan for the future. Financial professions couldn't have a worse rap these days, much of it deserved, but there are real social problems that require financial solutions. People need to save for retirement, plan for the kids' college tuition, and take on mortgages.<p>I think it is really good for society to have smart people work on investment management. Especially if they are automating, collaborating, and discussing their work openly - the opposite of today's Wall Street. I like that QuantBlock did something original, and I love that they are striving for really broad access.<p>We think the key to advancing algorithmic investment is to create more access so smart hackers can tinker with investment strategies. Those folks should be able to explore and test ideas/algos without spending a few years building a backtester, or a few years' of salary on data. That's why our backtester is free to use at quantopian.com, and why the source code will be released at PyData NYC (<a href=""http://blog.quantopian.com/pydatanyc-here-we-come/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.quantopian.com/pydatanyc-here-we-come/</a>).<p>I wrote more about where we want Quantopian to go, and where I think finance needs to go on our blog: <a href=""http://blog.quantopian.com/quantopian-manifesto/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.quantopian.com/quantopian-manifesto/</a>",1348284869
4557041,comment,4554126,4556866,1,0,lowboy,,,"I agree with your priorities on how long term concerns trump up-front discomfort when learning a language. But to me it would be of long term benefit to never see parens that could be otherwise indicated by sig whitespace patterns like the empty/foo/bar indented block we have above.<p>The elegance seems to come from having a simpler parser, and one less thing to explain to people when they're learning the lanuage. As a user of a language and not a developer of a parser, the first doesn't concern me and the second should be trumped by long-term concerns. Using significant whitespace to eliminate syntax is elegant in its own way as well.<p>Again, maybe this is just because I'm not a lisper, but keeping implicit parens that follow a well-established pattern should be a trivial mental task for a developer.

The implication is that many web \n  developers can do something that is both useful and safe \n  with only the low-level API.\n</code></pre>\nI was not trying to suggest that <i>only</i> the low-level API is sufficient. I think there's no question that for some segment of potential use cases, they would be unquestionably better served if their hand was held all the way through, that that the crypto protocol and exchange was fully dictated for them. I think that's true for just about any use of crypto.<p>However, if we <i>only</i> provide a so-called high-level API (what I've been terming as box/unbox, and which is conceptually similar to what Keyczar, Nacl, or even JOSE offer), then I think there's even an larger number of known and possible use cases that simply <i>cannot</i> be implemented. That's why I believe it's more useful to provide a low-level API.<p>I think perhaps there are unrealistic expectations on what this is trying to do or who this is trying to serve. It's not trying to save the world from bad crypto. It's attempting to bring to the web platform what has existed in native code for 3+ decades - pitfalls and all.<p>I'd also be concerned about the argument going the other way - if we only provided a high-level protocol & API, then developers would need to implement whatever protocol specified atop the existing low-level primitives (OpenSSL, PKCS#11, CNG, etc). There, just as well, the risk is that people will get it wrong - or that 'others' will write libraries to do it right.

The result of the hash function will be to convert an arbitrary length user entered password into a fixed length quantity.

Part of designing a startup business model is organizing growth so that you are unconstrained, so that more input produces greater output, earlier -- whether it's capital, users, employees, or support. All it takes is for one component of your business to not scale and you won't hit your growth numbers despite the brilliance of every other part.<p>Capital is just one of the areas you have to look at. Amazon is a decent example. Bezos chose books because it was (a) accessible (catalogs existed), and (b) he got 6 months to pay back booksellers, which meant he could afford to grow the more he sold, by using the money owed to the booksellers as float.<p>Startups would do well to evaluate all possible constraints on growth, capital and otherwise. Many times small tweaks to how you sell your product (or what product you sell) can produce large variations in the amount and timing of capital needed.<p>Here's an example: do you have customers pay for the first 30 days up front, with an option to cancel within that time? Or do you charge your customers <i>after</i> the first 30 days are up?<p>Now, you'd think the latter would always be better for ""growth"", because it involves a weaker commitment -- no money changes hands early.<p>But it also has a huge capital cost differential, if the service costs a substantial amount of money to deliver. In order to grow the latter model, you'll have to obtain more and more capital over time as you grow.<p>But if you do the former, you can ""fund"" your company's growth <i>off of</i> its earlier growth. Although this might impact growth negatively, by turning away customers that ""won't pay"" for the first 30 days up front, but who would have become customers the other way.<p>So which is better? It really depends. If your growth rate is already 7% with the pay-up-front model, that's better IMO than getting, say, an 8% growth rate with the pay-after model. The latter will require raising increasingly greater amounts of capital, despite the fact that it's growing ""faster"" initially, ultimately <i>hurting</i> your growth or wiping out your equity, or both.<p>Both approaches will still have their ""S"" curves end up at the same place (the market size doesn't change), but let's be blunt here: no company can catches up to 7% growth, so wasting your equity on 8% growth just makes you poorer, and the VCs richer.<p>Sustainable growth is just as important, and treating capital as something you ""have to"" raise is exactly what VCs want you to think, since, hey, that's what they sell. Venture  capital is a financial <i>tool</i>, not the only (real) way to capitalize a startup during and after growth.",1348283276
