In SQL, it would be something like ""select * from users where gender='male"". Why can't NoSQL databases support a query similar to that? Why do they require me to describe a similar request in their own unique syntax?<p>I sometimes get the feeling that coining a term like NoSQL is a marketing gimmick which hurts people actually trying to learn the nuanced differences but I am only getting started. Why can't we <i>extend</i> SQL to support ""NoSQL""-specific cases instead of replacing it with <i>nothing</i>.<p>I get that a big part of SQL is joins and the philosophy of joins goes against the idea of NoSQL.
