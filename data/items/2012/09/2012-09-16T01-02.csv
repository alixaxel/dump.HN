There is also a difference between having a bias towards the truth, and just being biased.  Saying ""Man landed on the moon"" is biased towards the truth.  Saying ""Science is a solution to many of our problems"" is just bias.  (albeit one that I have)<p>If something's really important, you'll hear about it (I would call that important subset of events the news, as opposed to the ""news"").  I fully support Joel's ""Just turn it off and make better use of your time"" position - you (and your community/country) will be better served.<p>Also - don't get me wrong, there is a difference between broadly educated, and well read (which I strongly, strongly support) - and being up to date on the ""news"" - which I see minimal value in.",1347760675

4527992,comment,4526050,4527316,2,0,monkeypizza,,,"The scales used on global measures of education are scored in a way that makes a few low scores a lot more influential than a few high scores (since the average score on the test is around 70%, it takes more than 3 100% scores to balance out one 0%).  So countries which are more homogenous (so that their upper end's scores don't get capped at 100%) and don't have as big of a low class do well, such as Japan, Korea, and Finland.<p>If the tests were structured so that the average score was 10 out of 100, one genius who scored 100 would be worth 9 people who scored zero.<p>I think this is a more realistic way to score education; would you rather have the median of the population go from grade level 7 algebra, to grade level 7.1?  or would you rather have 20% more utter geniuses in your society?  Both have value, obviously, but breakthroughs are made at the edges, and only need to be made once.<p>All this is to say that we should focus on where the returns are greatest.",1347760477

In practice, it would make a lot more sense to pre-define the buckets and update those when doing insert/update/delete. Even 1m buckets is just 1-4MB of data, depending on how many counts do you want (2^8 - 2^32). That would give you O(1) update and O(k) range-sum where k = number of buckets. You want k to be smaller than n otherwise you're back to the naive implementation.",1347760391

4527975,comment,4527632,4527946,3,0,seanmcdirmid,,,"Eventually, but two problems that could slow down the process (meaning, not necessarily ""soon""):<p>(1) Apple has made lots of forward looking investments to get long-term lock ups on supplies even if the manufacturer is Samsung. So perhaps they've already bought the next 1 or 2 years of these displays that Samsung can produce. Samsung would then have to build more factories to supply the needs of other OEMs, where the OEMs did not help invest ahead of time to help build this capacity themselves.<p>(2) More significantly: the operating system and its software eco-system must actively support high-resolution displays. Since Windows 8 is more popular on the low end, there might not be much incentive for Microsoft or their software partners to actively change their software to support what would initially probably be a very niche market for them. Without the software, there isn't much motivation to produce the hardware. Apple doesn't really have this problem: they've sort of forced the issue by releasing the hardware first, they've upgraded their OS to deal, they've primed the market with a few enabled apps, and their users are fairly high end, will demand more apps, where the app developers will quickly oblige (Adobe came out with a HiDPI version of the Creative Studio tools recently).<p>Eventually we will all get high resolution displays, but it will probably take much longer for the PC ecosystem than the Mac ecosystem. If its successful enough on Mac, however, I would expect the process to speed up on PCs so they remain competitive.",1347760056

It makes sense that more income helps happiness only up to a point, as the stresses of simply securing that income become the main drivers of daily stress once basic needs are met. I wonder what the relationship between hourly rate vs happiness looks like.<p>When income is casually mentioned it is usually understood to mean wealth. This study is then implicitly an argument against focusing on amassing too much wealth, with the claim that being richer won't make you happier. But the methodology of the study just doesn't back this up. We need to be careful how and when it is cited.",1347758544
