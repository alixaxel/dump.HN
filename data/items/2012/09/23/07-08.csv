Although we had our concerns because you can't see what's inside a Beanstalkd queue (duh, because it's a queue), but building a system for monitoring the failures was not a big deal.<p>And of course the tubes rock. Now I can build a separate tube for each retry, I can set different priorities for the tubes (so the more fail prone tubes won't block all workers), I can set a deadline for a job to finish and if the worker dies in the middle the job will be returned for the other workers. And best of all, I can monitor all tubes nicely with Graphite.",1348386935

4560353,comment,4554996,4560006,1,0,unixnoob,,,"I really don't think it's as big an issue as people make it.<p>People commenting about this in lists and forums and blogs make the issue more complex than it is because they have all sorts of assumptions about how it has to work.  But as Rob Pike says when you assume you put plum paste on your ass. ""Discovery phase.""  This is nerd stuff.<p>Put all the nerd stuff aside for a moment.  When you want to telephone someone, how to you handle the ""discovery phase""?  You look up the telephone number and place the call.  Everyone does this the world over.  Second, how many people do you actually telephone in your entire lifetime?  Hundreds?  Thousands?  (Are you a telemarketer?)  Third, how many of them are people you see face-to-face at some point?  People do not normally call lots of anonymous people.<p>A telephone network.  (Actually a system of regional networks.) Everyone has a number. You get their number and you make the call.  But how?   According to nerds on the web, this should be a complex problem with no easy solution.  But millions of people, non-technical people, make telephone calls everyday.<p>To think the web equivalent of a telephone directory is an unsolvable problem is ridiculous.  And to think that every person needs a directory with billions of names is similarly silly.  They will only need a small subset.<p>Moreover, with modern storage capacities, you could store a billion names and numbers on a small device no problem.  Searching billion row databases is quite fast, if you use the right software.  But you will never even need to go that far.<p>AFAIK people do not change their telephone numbers very frequently.  Certainly not on a whim.  If they do change it, then they have to let others know.  Somehow they manage this., even if they are non-tecnical.  Of course if you keep changing your number you'll be harder to contact.  This ic common sense.  But why would you do that?  Why would you need to keep changing your number?  Get a number and stick to it.<p>If you think stuff like MobileIP is the solution to roaming then you need to keep looking at what's possible.  There are simpler and more reliable ways to do it.<p>How many people do you call in a lifetime?  Think about it.",1348386756

4560337,comment,4560070,4560070,9,0,whalesalad,,,"> My startup currently is about nothing. It lacks a product, idea, or even market. I have a few thoughts about what it could be about, but nothing has been chosen (or even tested).<p>I don't understand how this has garnered so much attention. I feel like I'm at a self help meeting where we are all applauding each other for not eating a piece of cake, or smoking a cigarette. In other words, a bunch of noise over nothing substantial. While I'm glad you have a lot of success under your belt, how is it relevant? You specifically state you have no idea, concept, or product. Nothing at all.<p>You don't have a startup. You have a desire to work hard at something, but you have no idea what to do. Thanks for sharing???<p>Funny, I was just reading Steve Blanks article on why so many startups suck  I'd suggest reading it: <a href=""http://steveblank.com/2012/09/21/why-too-many-startups-er-suck/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steveblank.com/2012/09/21/why-too-many-startups-er-su...</a><p>But to reiterate: you don't have a startup. And please don't start a company <i>just to start a company</i> ... Do something that you love AND that people truly need. The signal to noise in our startup world is out of control.<p>Finally, I admire your desire to be open and transparent but honestly coming out and saying you have no idea/product/service is just a waste of a database row. It sounds naive. You won't get anywhere on a wish. You need substance.<p>P.S. services that I want <i>right now</i>:<p>* A concierge (iamexec on roids) to find me an apartment. Given a criteria, find me X places per week to review and then take Y that I like and arrange appointments to see them. A human touch is most certainly required. Padmapper is a pain in the ass. I'll give a service a hundred dollars to find me 5 extremely solid leads in a week. Between this and that price, studio or 1br, near the metro (dc). If you build an engine to scale that so you and a few other people can handle business... You're the next Donald Trump.<p>* register me to vote. I pay $x and you do the rest. Oh you need a birth certificate? Damn. Oh, but you're providing a fax number, iPhone snapshot, or other means to get it or other required docs to you?? Great! Here's $20 fucking dollars. I don't care how much it costs, within reason, as long as it works and it requires zero thought from me.<p>* I'm a fanboy. I want a heroku coffee cup but they don't exist. Follow the HNTees lead: provide people who might frequent HN or understand the meaning of the phrase NoSQL with swag. I'll give you fifteen bucks for a purple heroku coffee cup. And don't do zazzle/cafepress garbage. I want quality goods. I also want crap pertaining to ruby and python. Tasteful, quality goods/swag for people like you and I.",1348386159
