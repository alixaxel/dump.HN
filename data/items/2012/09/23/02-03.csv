Just have a high-density commercial business district and sensible long and short range transit. Here in Chicago, within half an hour or so on the El or the Metra, I can live in a downtown high-rise, a condo in a family-friendly in-town neighborhood, a single family home in a family-friendly in-town neighborhood, or a full blown grass and trees suburb, and still never get in a car as part of my commute.<p>The problem in SF isn't that people want to live in different areas. The same is true in NYC or Chicago. The problem is that there isn't proper zoning. To make transit feasible, you need an extremely dense central business district with a ton of office space.

4559769,comment,4559274,4559274,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is an interesting thing. Fish are over fished, stocks decline, the price goes up, fishing companies go out of business. The response has been sustainably farmed fish, that market is up hugely of course (its worth investing in if you are a futurist) There are also indications that changes in the ocean temperature and acidity are moving fish populations around such that a 'fishery collapse' might also be 'they went somewhere else'.<p>The last few years the salmon season was halted in California. Between low water for spawning and lots of fishing the catches were going down and few fish were returning to spawn. Now they have recovered somewhat and California is getting a better idea of what the population can support. Meanwhile it gets very expensive to eat fish.<p>Its for this reason I doubt that fish stocks will go completely extinct. Unlike land stocks where it 'cost' zero to wait for game to go by, fish require that you be in a boat to go get them. That costs money. If the return becomes so uncertain that you don't know if you will make or lose money on the outing, rational actors will stop playing.<p>Most of the mass extinction / exhaustion theories I've read are based on predicting a systemic collapse rather than the last fish of a particular type is removed manually. What is not clear is whether or not these systemic collapses actually occur. Localized food chains have some great examples (like coral reefs dying due to trawling and then losing the entire ecosystem sort of like the rain forest becoming farmland) but the deep sea stocks are much more difficult to kill off in that way.",1348367233

4559762,comment,4558916,4559679,8,0,ak217,,,"> Zoning is a disaster for commerce in the valley... New development is virtually nonexistent<p>What surprises me is that there is still no organization that adequately represents technology companies' and workers' interests on the peninsula and in the city. Most cities here seem to have public employees' associations that have a big say in how the city operates and develops. I think a PAC representing pro-density, pro-development, pro-infrastructure, pro-public transit interests that runs candidates for city councils and builds a track record of successful actions can become the prime political force on the peninsula. (At least if it manages to keep the public project costs from ballooning as they're prone to doing in CA.)<p>Meanwhile, the public is subjected to mind-boggling pieces like <a href=""http://blog.sfgate.com/stew/2012/09/20/is-tech-destroying-san-francisco/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sfgate.com/stew/2012/09/20/is-tech-destroying-sa...</a>.",1348367046

Those people would be much more likely to hire taxis, increasing the business liquidity, reducing the uncertainty for taxi drivers in the business who might go a few hours without a ride.  The advantage to drivers, is that an uber customer is identified before they get into the vehicle.  They also have the means to pay.   The ability to discriminate on source/destination is removed, but, in many taxi regions, they aren't, in theory, allowed to do that anyways.<p>I'm not arguing that 100% of all the uber rules are an advantage for drivers - in particular, the ability to turn down a $30 cab fare in order to wait for the $70 SFO trip will be to their economic disadvantage, but it will result in a healthier business overall.",1348366455

But if you don't know the domain, this is your best bet.<p>- make a product that an employee in your target market could/would pay for themselves. Once you have a product users love, you can work out enterprise features like on-site deployment and system/data integration.
