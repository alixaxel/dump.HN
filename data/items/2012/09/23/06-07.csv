If the feedback loop is broken, the system deteriorates and ultimately falls apart. If it's inefficient, the system tends to be inefficient as well. (Examples: soviet-style planned economy, rabbits in Australia etc.)<p>This kind of thing (teachers grade students, students grade teachers) could improve the efficiency of the feedback loop and thus efficiency of the education system as a whole.",1348383533

4560240,comment,4558879,4559686,3,0,robomartin,,,"> Private sector seems pretty enthusiastic about the wars to me<p>Who?  Your local baker?  The mechanic around the corner?  How about the printer?  Or the dry cleaner?  Apple?<p>Sure, businesses that make things for the military are going to benefit from wars.  It only stands to reason that they might be more pro-war (or pro-conflict) than the local dry cleaner.<p>Here's the paradox.  And it takes a little reasoning.<p>Who starts wars?  Government.<p>Who benefits from wars.  Well, nobody, but let's just say that government contractors do.  They make weapons, missiles, bullets, crap.  They do.<p>If you can make so much money making stuff for the war machinery, are you going to bother making stuff for consumer applications?  Nope.  If you can sell toilets for $1,000 rather than $50 you are going to make radiation hardened toilets.  Let the Chinese make the ""small stuff"".<p>What happens when you have a war-driven economy then?  Well, your consumer products manufacturing base goes to shit.  Wages are artificially inflated by the war machine and, very soon, you have to pay a guy $50 per hour to put screws into a VCR.  Therefore, the consumer business has to go to other countries where someone can make a VCR for less than we can.<p>And, what happens over a long period of time of doing things this way?  Decades?  You completely erode your manufacturing base to the point where you almost can't make anything in the country any more.<p>So, there you go.  The whole business of government being so smart.  Government providing everything we need.  Government being all-knowing and providing the foundation upon which we will all build our empires. This same government is almost solely responsible for the destruction of our consumer manufacturing infrastructure by creating a falsely inflated military economy that made it impossible to get anything done in this country.<p>Government is an ass.<p>If government is responsible for all of our success.  If we should thank and revere government for all we have accomplished.  Then, we should also hold government responsible for all of our failures.  You can't have it both ways.  If they make things happen then they own the disasters too.<p>Mind you, I am not one for complete lack of government or complete lack of regulation.  This is where I have trouble with political alignment labels.  Saying that you are ""libertarian"" doesn't necessarily mean that you adhere to the textbook definition of what this might mean today. The same is true of other political views.<p>Yes, some government is necessary.  They need to look after our roads, power grid, ports, etc.  The government we have today is far larger than what we probably need.<p>I use fire in survival situations as an imperfect analogy:<p>When a fire is the right size it provides, warmth, comfort, security, the ability to cook food, etc.  In a very real sense, it ""works"" with your, not against you.<p>If it is too small it is useless.  In the wilderness you might have to fend-off predators because they will not be deterred by your tiny fire.  You might not be able to cook food or sterilize water.  A small fire is bad.<p>If a fire gets too big it is dangerous.  It can get out of hand and kill you.  Beyond a certain size it actually becomes another threat to your survival.  If big enough --and if there's enough fuel around-- it starts to create its own wind and it grows larger and larger, until it consumes everything around it.  The fire only cares about itself. Every particle serves the fire and not you.  It is actually this huge mass that starts to work against you, not for you.<p>Our government is too large.  It creates its own wind.  It is growing larger and larger.  We have too many government workers, their corresponding unions, their families and retirees that form a unified voting block that mindlessly supports, well, bigger government.  It is quickly becoming a threat to our own survival.  It is working against us, not with or for us.<p>Nobody is proposing that we have no government and live in total anarchy.  Just like the small fire, that would be dangerous.  What we do need is a government of the right size and mindset.  We have not had that for decades.",1348383033

This seems unbelievable, it can't be true.""  I also know coworkers that are rumored to have those multi-million-$ retention grants; I'm fairly certain they exist.",1348380808

It'd have been great with more buses and trains<p>and even where there are a few, it can take you two hours to get to friends only 10 or 15 miles away (this is more due to the design of their interlinks). If you want to encourage people to take public transit and walk more, you can't make cars so convenient for most of the ways they travel around the bay area.<p>>  I could get to the grocery store. I could get to plenty of shops. I could get to dozens of restaurants - I know this from making a point out of trying new restaurants every time I was in town - as well as bars etc.<p>And this shows the real reason behind your post: you were staying in a hotel on El Camino :) Head up into one of the neighborhoods nearby and suddenly <i>nothing</i> is nearby. This is less of a problem in a city like Palo Alto, which is centered around El Camino and has a decent bus service, but for many of the towns along the 101, a car is pretty much the only way you can live there.<p>Meanwhile, take a look at the correlation between housing prices with the more walkable cities (like Palo Alto and Menlo Park that you mentioned). I won't be buying a house in any dense part of Palo Alto any time soon.<p>> years ago, I did go out clubbing in SF while staying in Santa Cruz without having a car to get me back - if you want it bad enough, even that works<p>No, it won't work unless you're paying hundreds for a cab, you get a friend to drive you, or you head home at like 6 in the evening. AFAIK, there's really no other way to do that (and transit on google maps isn't coming up with anything short of ""wait 6 hours for transfer to bus"").<p>I would say Caltrain having its last train at midnight is an even worst feature than its operating schedule.<p>> So, yes: Spoiled. Large parts of the worlds population - including in developed countries - are living places where getting to stuff they want or need takes far longer on average.<p>Sure, but that's a pretty useless definition of spoiled; essentially any non-utilitarian aspect of living would fall under it.<p>City planning and public transit exist to encourage good behavior and serve the public. Building walkable neighborhoods is good, building around public transit to make it accessible is also good. When you haven't done these things, ""well, you should walk more"" isn't going to fly when ""buy a car"" is so easy, and probably necessary anyways for those few times when the thing you need isn't accessible by public transit.<p>You're not going to make living in SF seem less cool or convenient any time soon, so all the current system is doing is encouraging car use and this private bus system.<p>-- non-car-owner considering moving up to SF because he's sick of using zipcar so often and commuting all weekend to see friends up in the city",1348380791

More evidence gives you higher confidence and lower margin of error. And as the article says, these student surveys provide clean, stable data that doesn't fluctuate very much from year to year and doesn't require much correction for race and family income.<p>These surveys take on the order of 10-15 minutes. That's nothing compared to a battery of standardized tests. They wouldn't have to be very informative at all in order to be worth the small sacrifice of instructional time, and if they're the second-best predictor of class achievement, then they're certainly worth the time (if the results are actually used).<p>I don't think there's going to be much movement to stop paying attention to standardized tests and curriculums, since these surveys don't measure the same thing - roughly speaking, the standardized tests seek to measure how much was learned, and these surveys add a dimension of <i>why</i>.",1348380781

It was not without reason that homeopaths considered the bases of their approach to medical problems to be more logical and more promising than the inherited tradition of the ancients, upon which mainstream physicians still based their practices.""<p>You have to remember also that 'scientific' is a relative term. Placebo controlled trials weren't invented until the 50s. And doing properly controlled placebo trials (with active placebos) is very rare even today.<p>Homeopathy of the 1860s and 1870s might not seem at all scientific by today's standards, but that doesn't mean it wasn't a significant advance in science at the time. (And by the way this was well after Hahnemann, who did most of his work on homeopathy in the 1810s and was already long dead by this time.)",1348380157
