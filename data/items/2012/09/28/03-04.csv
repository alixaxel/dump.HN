If the applicants are this lackadaisical in keeping their own data private, why would I trust them with the company's or my customer's sensitive information?<p>With that said, I definitely understand why an applicant would be offended by the question. In fact, I would hope they are!

Looks quite similar to the Creative Zii (Egg platform) and the Zii Labs' ZMS-05 processor which they marketed as ""Stemcell Computing""... and a lot of other attempts.<p>They use a Zenboard (Xilinx Zync, ARM+FPGA) as a base platform. My first reaction; they claim this being 'open source'. Nothing about the ARM processor or even the core inside the FPGA is open source. What they will deliver is the toolchain and the documentation, but no IP or RTL code for the cores. Another Fauxpen source project... using it merely as a buzzword to get people involved; comparable to the Beagleboard to get usecases and branding out.<p>When hardware is called ""open source"", they need to look at how Milkymist does it. PCB design files are offered, but also the RTL verilog is available for the CPU (in fact the whole SoC).",1348804731

4584130,comment,4583587,4583587,13,0,michaelochurch,,,"I hate to be the downer, but this ""fuck 'em"" attitude doesn't work for most people. Sure, society is mean-spirited, limiting, imbecilic, and cutthroat. The ratrace literally serves no purpose (it's a sterilized, time-consuming social-climbing circus that has almost nothing to do with work, and is not necessary to get done the work society actually needs, more often getting in the way of actual work) but one cannot just take 5 years out of it and get back into the game with the same status. Ageism is <i>huge</i> in the business world (you lose opportunities as you get older and less ""shiny"") and even one year is a massive, often intolerable loss.<p>The ""fuck 'em"" attitude would be great if it were sustainable, but it's not. You can't keep living like a teenager when you're in your 40s. Want to have kids? Then, you need to own your house (it's good for their self-esteem and has measurable effects on their social and academic success to own the house they live in) and get them into good schools and make sure they have the opportunities (intellectual, athletic, creative, occupational) that will socialize them well and provide them with the connections to have a decent shot of actually achieving something instead of just being some entitled guy's pawn. Otherwise, you're just generating middle-grade meat for society to munch on. So kids are super-expensive, but you can't really have them at age 60, and you better have laid your groundwork (career-wise) for many years before you make that decision.<p>It makes me sick to read this bad advice that tells people they can just do what they want and that society will accept them for being unique, wonderful snowflakes. Or ""do what you love and the money will follow"". It's total bullshit. People generally suck and are mean-spirited and vindictive, and this idea that society will catch and nurture those who indulge themselves in a gap or two is ridiculous. You know what happens (if you're not rich and well-connected) to your career if you travel for 2 years after school? People resent the fuck out of you (because they didn't have or take that opportunity) and ding you for that alone. Six months of leisure travel when young is, for this reason, somewhat more of a liability than that amount of regular unemployment (which, post-2008, makes you look more <i>unlucky</i> than incompetent).<p>What you actually need to do is figure out what matters, what to care about, and how much. For example, you should care about your job well enough to do it well and get promotions. You should not care about it so much that you get into conflicts that damage your career. You should care about your success in the company (and in your career) but not about big-picture company-wide issues over which you have no influence. (Pay attention to these, because they may be relevant to your career, but don't get emotionally involved or take stupid risks, even when those risks benefit the company, because you won't give a shit about ""good for the company"" if you get fired.) You can't take a ""fuck 'em"" attitude or get a chip on your shoulder, but blind obedience to managerial authority is going to lead to mediocrity and misery and, in the long run, anomie. Somewhere between ""yes, sir"" douchebaggery and ""fuck 'em"" is the right attitude-- the ""middle path"".",1348801991

I've used dozens of pieces of software targeted at real estate agents and I can't think of a more broken software market. It's truly shameful.<p>Usability is among the worst you will find. This is particularly egregious since RE is filled with some of the most technically incompetent people you've ever met. Some real estate agents are fantastic and have found their calling in that job, but the overwhelming majority of the ones I met ended up in that industry by accident. I tend to joke that if  you're too incompetent for all other careers, go ahead and get a real estate license.<p>One of the biggest problems is that not one solution I've ever used considered flow. They solve small pain points, but none are workable into the more complex workflows that need to be accomplished.",1348801460

A good friend would congratulate you, regardless of whether you beat them out for the job or not.  Sounds like a case of sour grapes to me... and some people don't just have a few, they have entire vineyards.  Nothing will ever be their fault, it can't be because the other person was more skilled, or had more more experience, they must have had an unfair advantage.  That's easier than taking a hard look at yourself, being honest and addressing the real issues.",1348801278
