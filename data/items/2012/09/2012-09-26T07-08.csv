The financing is a little more problematic because you could argue a lot of things should be illegal like Louis Vuitton handbags for example. Have you seen the prices? It is unreal you could get 5 bespoke handbags from a master leathercrafter made from virgin snake leather or something. People who want to pay 3000 USD for a laptop are probably gullible enough to pay lots of money for other overpriced things as well. A reasonable requirement would be to always have to post total amount owed though to help people unable to do math. If they still agree there is not really much you can do.",1348646247

He said he got it legally, but ""would be willing to sell it back for 2.000. Right.
So I sent in all the documentation I had to the legal department of Instra, where he moved the domain. 
They gave the domain back to me right away, and like I mentioned, ICANN is still working out a few things, but it will be back to my full ownership hopefully within a few weeks. 
I can still access the admin site, so it's business as usual.
I'm thankful for all the support I got from Twitter users, email etc. Cheers!",1348646200

Well, judging from the comments, it seems that many perceive bootstrapping only applies to the early stages of the company. But I find that hard to stomach as someone who is also bootstrapping a company. When you bootstrap, you use your own revenues to finance growth. Getting investors is an alternative to that strategy. I don't see how you can both bootstrap AND have investors.<p>Looking at it differently, maybe they didn't need the capital, but they took it. You don't just accidentally get $5M from Union Square... term sheets happen. Lawyers are involved. Cap tables are adjusted. That doesn't happen when you bootstrap. It happens when you use other people's money to finance growth. AKA not bootstrapping.<p>That being said, it seems they did this particularly intelligently and Union Square was a fabulous choice for everyone involved.",1348645154

That's about as complicated as it gets (considering the example extends a custom exception instead of inheriting from java.lang.Exception). I'll note that your example doesn't declare any return code anywhere. Now, I'm curious to know how you would do the equivalent of this with error codes:<p><pre><code>  public class MigrationException extends Exception {
    public MigrationException(String msg) { super(msg); }
  }
  
  public class SqlException extends Exception (
    public SqlException(String msg) { super (msg); }
  }

  public class Migration {
    public void migrate(Statement stat, int migrationNumber)
      throws MigrationException, SqlException{
      if (migrationNumber <= 5) throw new MigrationException(""Wrong migration number "" + migrationNumber, should be > 5"");
      // throws SqlException
      stat.executeNonQuery(""INSERT foo INTO bar"");
    }
  }

  public class MigrationRunner {
    public void run(Statement stat, Migration migration, int migrationNumber) {
      try {
        migration.migrate(stat, migrationNumber);
      }
      catch(MigrationException ex) {
        migrationLogger.error(""Bad migration"", ex);
      }
      catch(SqlException ex) {
        migrationLogger.error(""DB error"", ex);
        sqlLogger.error(""Error during migration"", ex);
      }
    }

</code></pre>
I'm on purpose not reimplementing an SQL driver here :)<p>I'm not quite sure why you are arguing about ""error declarations which can be checked at compile time in C++"". Sure, C++ has exceptions, but I thought you were trying to make a point about return codes, not C++ exceptions vs language X exception. My point, on the other hand, is that it's very easy to do this:<p><pre><code>  #define SQL_ERROR 1
  // whoops, same error code due to copy-paste
  #define MIGRATION_ERROR 1

  void handleError(int errorCode) {
    // Too bad, this was actually an SQL error
    if (errorCode == MIGRATION_ERROR) {

No compile-time check for that. Or even:<p><pre><code>  #define MIGRATION_ERROR 1
  #define SQL_ERROR 2

  void handleError(int errorCode) {
    // I actually meant 2 here
    if (errorCode == 1) {
      logSqlError();
    }
  }</code></pre>",1348642923

I get that it's a new site, so I can accept that it might be tough to get recommendations right away, but it would be really helpful to explain <i>why</i> there aren't any results. Is it because I haven't rated enough beers? Is it because there aren't enough other users that have similar tastes? Is it because there's a delay before results show up?<p>Also, I had to try searching for some beers multiple times because my search didn't quite match how it's entered in your database. For example, I didn't realize that ""redhook"" is one word instead of two. I know that search is tricky and it's perfectly understandable, but I just thought I'd let you know.<p>Other than that, it looks great. I'll definitely be checking back for recommendations in the future.",1348642889

Beam has a charger stand system too whereas DR needs to be plugged into the wall (by someone on location) Whether that justifies the price diff I can't say.",1348642843
