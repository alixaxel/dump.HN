4466670,comment,4464998,4465502,1,0,thedudemabry,,,"I'm nowhere near the guru stage, but I'm definitely down with convention over conviction. No matter what stage you're in (or even alternate paths), making your code communicate your intent to your coworkers is much more important than penning your magnus opus. It's okay for freshly-minted programmers to blindly follow the patterns of the grey-hairs and for the zealous to write heathen code, depending on who will be maintaining the project in six months. The equilibrium of the team will balance as everyone learns through building good product.<p>I agree with you on personal projects, as well. Do whatever lets you meet your goal, whether that be learning how to hardcore TDD or getting a horribly-written, hacky project out to your friends.",1346579712

The metal heatsink has much higher thermal conductivity than the oil. The advantage of the oil is that it circulates and carries heat away to another heatsink that ultimately dissipates heat to the air.",1346579624

The comment was about a verbal gaffe by a recently nominated and controversial Vice-Presidential candidate.<p>I'm not sure about your countrymen, but Americans have an annoying way of derailing every conversation and forum into petty, non-sequitur, assume-bad-faith attacks on politicians of the opposing party in a way that really adds nothing to the discourse. It's not that the comment wouldn't have bothered me if it hadn't been about a politician; it's that the comment wouldn't have even been made if it wasn't about a politician. There's this obsession with proving that politicians of the opposing party are terrible human beings in every possible way (so that we may feel righteous in our cause) instead of actually discussing things that matter. The end result is a sequence of catty remarks that only convince people who already agree with you, which stops any productive dialogue before it starts. It's the single most destructive thing about the American political culture.<p>HN is one of my few remaining refuges from that bullshit.

4466642,comment,4465819,4466621,3,0,lutusp,,,"> If you are in the US (and in some other countries), you know it's illegal, right?<p>Not necessarily. An open WiFi hub can represent a free service offered by, for example, a restaurant or lodging establishment, both of which expect and accept public logons in order to attract business. It's not obvious how an individual might distinguish between these hubs and a private hub that happens not to have a password.<p>If someone decided to prosecute a user of an open hub, they would have to shoulder the burden of evidence to prove that a person knowingly defrauded the hub operator, rather than innocently accessed a public resource.<p>If the hub has a password, that's a different story altogether, but in the case of an open WiFi hub, the burden is on law enforcement to prove that an individual knowingly stole the service. Innocent until proven guilty.<p>Imagine someone driving along a public road, next to a drive-in theater. He pulls over and watches the movie over the top of an inadequate fence. Is he guilty of a crime?<p>Imagine someone walking along a street who stops and reads the newspaper headlines through the front of a newspaper vending machine. Is he guilty of a crime?<p>Both the above examples would require the prosecutor to prove ""guilty knowledge"", knowledge that the behavior was wrong. It's the same with open WiFi hubs. There are plenty of open hubs that are intentionally public, and that accept logons from anyone. And there are hubs owned by unsophisticated computer owners that don't have a password simply because the owner doesn't know how to set one up. Is the public required to distinguish between these cases, or face prosecution? No.",1346578480

An insurance policy can have a single applicant and still function as it should -- the issuer is betting that the applicant won't suffer a loss, the applicant is betting that he will. An actuary sets the rate based on his best guess about the possibility of a claim.<p>This thesis is proven by the classic alternative to buying insurance -- self-insurance, a scheme in which an individual sets aside his own cushion against loss, or ""self-insures"" -- accepts risk using his own resources.<p>Many states will accept an alternative to otherwise mandatory car insurance -- a personal bond against claims. The advantage to the individual is that the bond can earn money as an investment while it stands as proof of personal responsibility.<p>So the idea that insurance means joining a pool of insured individuals may be true in many cases, but it isn't a requirement for insurance to function. And it certainly isn't ""the point"".",1346577731
