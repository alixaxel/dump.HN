Or at least not anywhere close to what I would consider good enough. I was lucky to have 2 great teachers mixed in with a lot of mediocre to bad ones.<p>America is failing as a nation when it comes to education. We set up our education system based on babysitting kids for far too long. All throughout history people started becoming members of society far sooner. Most became an apprentice around 13 or so. We babysit in high school until 18, and it means that the students who would rather be working in a field or on cars are miserable, and those who want to go to higher education don't get the environment they deserve.",1346558356

It's also not that great an example because it begs the question why one moment a set of strings ('words' as variable name feels weird to me because I think in c of word boundaries, but whatever) is set<string> (please use 'namespace std') and next moment its char<i></i> argv. These are obviously simple things to anyone with c++ knowledge, but teaching this to someone is just likely to put them off. There's no reason to use c/c++ today unless you're coding drivers or very performance critical things.<p>A set isn't necessarily implemented using a red-black tree, most likely its a binary tree of some kind, but why would anyone put that in a comment. It's a set, which just means there's only copy of any repeated 'words'.<p>I think the reason why c++ doesn't make a good language to teach youngsters is because stl is still a beast of a template library, still spits out garbage error messages and is painful to work with even by the most experienced of developers (25+ c/c++ here)<p>On the other hand, collections and data structures in python are simple, efficiently implemented and extremely succinct, if the value of a dictionary element contains 2 or 3 elements, or is another dictionary, or a map etc it's simple to do this in python, where as in stl pair<int, int> is great until you need three of them, then its auto_ptr or whatever and it starts to get unwieldy and the poor student trying to focus on the algorithm is now bogged down in the with the inelegance of a low level language.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love c and c++, but i'd rather teach some python or ruby because they can get stuff done and working and not struggle with tedious syntax.<p>len(set(sys.stdin.read().split(' ')))<p>C++ does have web frameworks too!

Lazy teachers that just show up and hand out worksheets.  Of course, they would give a very carefully prepared lecture on the day that the principal would sit in on their class, but then the next day they were right back to handing out worksheets.<p>I don't know what the solution is, but the problem is lazy teachers who do a bad job (or a combination of some that are lazy and others that are unqualified).  The motivation isn't racism, but I would agree that black students are more likely to be stuck with bad teachers.  Black schools tend to be less desirable to work at, worse facilities, worse funding, worse behavioral problems among students (it's a vicious cycle), parents who don't get involved (again, vicious cycle.  How can you help build a school that works when you have no firsthand experience with a school that works?).  The consequence is that the teachers that work at many of the schools that have large percentages of black students tend to be terrible teachers, not because someone is trying to actively hurt black students, but because the processes that help get bad teachers out (oversight, parental involvement) simply don't function in those schools, and the good teachers that start in that environment very quickly burn out (or are chased out by corrupt school administration when they speak out) and move on.",1346557194

I'm referring to the GP post that has the example with the yield call in it, the ruby example.<p>The Ruby example doesn't have the problem you mentioned because Ruby doesn't have generators at all.  In Python and PHP, yield means ""Suspend execution of this function and return a value to the caller, who can later call this function again to resume its execution.""

4466027,comment,4465469,4465852,3,0,zxcdw,,,"When you're stressed your blood's glucose levels get depleted which weakens your ability for self-control. Once you give in, especially when you are tired and exhausted, it's easier to go all ""fuck this, imma eat all I can for now and eat better later on!"". Of course, eating increases the glucose level of your blood and afterwards you feel kind of bad about it and the whole idea of giving in starts to feel stupid - ""I could've sticked to my promise"", ""It was just stupid, I should have been stronger"".<p>There's also the fact that habitual snacking and eating ""just a bit... ...all the time"" grows 1) a mental habit to the act of eating 2) physical dependency to the act of having glucose levels high 3) mental and physical dependency on the good experience(smell and taste).<p>I used to be a person who ate once a day(lunch), and perhaps ate a fruit(banana or an apple) a few times a week to supplement. Back then I really pitied people who couldn't control their weight. To me it was outright laughable that someone simply could not refuse the sweets, pastries, soft drinks, ... because for me they were never even an option I considered. These days though, while I am not obese(although I've gained a lot of weigh which I know I <i>should</i> get rid of) I've realized that I've became a habitual eater. I eat constantly, all the time. Small snacks, soft drinks, whatever. All the time. Every 15-30-45 minutes I check the fridge. And I can't help it. It's not hunger. It's not the taste itself. It's the act of eating. Act of having something down my throat. While I can resist it on irregular basis every now and then, I can't cancel the actual act of habit just like this. And man, this is horrible. Now I know how it is to not being able to ""just refuse it and that's it"". Luckily, I consume lots more than average person(physical work, hobbies, conscious effort) so I can control my weight at least. But I am hooked on eating. Habitual eater, no way to deny it.",1346556848

You can easily then run a reverse IP lookup on that address and usually find out the ISP.<p>Matching that to the initial seeder should be pretty trivial so long as you get to the torrent quickly enough after it was first seeded so you can see who the only person with 100% is.
