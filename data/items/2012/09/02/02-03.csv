I personally have never had to do it but I know quite a few people who will give fake names and social security numbers to avoid such situations.  Obviously this makes it more expensive for everyone else and one could argue the Affordable Care Act is a way to fix this security whole as much as anything.

4465970,comment,4465501,4465750,6,0,jerf,,,"This is why I think even if you are in favor of socialized health care, you really ought to be against the PPAFA. It's not ""socialized health care"", the glorious ideal you have in your head where everybody takes care of everybody and it's all smiles everywhere. It's an ungodly abomination of a thousand pages of hastily thrown together legislation with a bajillion moving parts, dozens of newly created agencies, what is basically gibberish in terms of who is paying for what driven more by what voters needed to hear than any resemblance to reality, and then after all of that, was brutally beaten by the legislative process until it could barely assemble a coalition to drag it across the finish line in a horrifically compromised state.<p>Trying to explain why this is a good idea and trying to explain why socialized health care is a good idea are two things that should not be done at the same time. If you think it's bizarre how many people aren't buying into the whole nothing-but-smiles theme now, wait until after a few years of experience with this turd.<p>The whole ""Oh, the monstrous heartless conservatives just want to throw granny over the cliff so they can save a buck"" is just a propaganda smokescreen put up so you don't look too much at the actual product you're pitching beyond the catchphrase level. Personally I feel some people are being pretty careless about what will actually happen to real people while they are moving abstract political footballs labelled ""socialized healthcare"" around without caring what's behind the abstraction. I know the abstract progress may feel good today, but the reality isn't going to stay behind the abstraction boundary.",1346554684

It's going to be accreditation and/or making the degree mean something. Anyone can read all the books and do all the exercises to have the equivalent education to a degree, but that is not the same as having the ""piece of paper"" so to speak.<p>Building and maintaining a reputation of an outstanding education program takes a long time potentially. However, some lessons could probably be learned from building something like YCombinator, where it went from basically nothing, to the ""it"" startup incubator, to being copied 100 times by every angel investment/incubator group under the sun. Going from zero credibility to industry wide credibility likely takes a lot of factors such as luck, timing, etc.<p>The next generation of education will need to create some ""hits"" or ""rockstars"" or whatever the right term might be as far as having some incredibly smart, talented people go through whatever the program is and go on to achieve some outstanding things.<p>If the next generation of education startups is going to be just teaching average skills to average people to fill average jobs, it won't work.<p>Like, teaching everybody Javascript is a good idea, but if that's the next generation, it's not going to make a dent in traditional education as an industry.",1346553239

There are no hoops required to get HIPAA guaranteed issue coverage when COBRA runs out. All insurers are required to offer it regardless of preexisting conditions. It will cost more, but coverage is automatic with no medical information required.<p>The usual procedure is to simultaneously apply for underwritten coverage and guaranteed issue. If the underwritten policy is declined, the guaranteed issue takes effect. If you know you'll be declined, you can skip the medical history on the application and apply for guaranteed issue only. You have 60 days after COBRA runs out to apply.<p>You are also eligible if your insurance ends because the company goes out of business without making COBRA available.<p>Any insurance company or agent can give you more information, or search for:<p>California HIPAA guaranteed issue",1346552200
