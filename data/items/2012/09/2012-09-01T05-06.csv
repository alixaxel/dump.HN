I can remember when Radio Shack was ... I don't know how else to say this ... a literal radio shack. I was a pre-teenage ham radio operator, and Radio Shack had pretty much everything I needed to build the radio equipment I needed for my ham station.<p>This was back when people built their own electronic equipment. Yes, I know that's hard to believe in the context of modern times, but when people wanted a radio transmitter or receiver, they would build one.<p>My first designs were based on vacuum tubes because ... again, I don't know how else to say this ... transistors were just a laboratory curiosity. Later, when Radio Shack started carrying transistors instead of tubes, I began designing transistor circuits.<p>An early Radio Shack store was a small warehouse of electronic parts, and almost no finished products. Now it's struggling to compete with all the other me-too finished-goods outlets. Even though the name ""Radio Shack"" sounds like a clever marketing slogan for modern times, originally it was a simple statement of fact -- they were a radio shack. And the employees actually knew something about electronics.<p>Later I designed electronics for the NASA Space Shuttle, so Radio Shack was part of my unorthodox education. I'll be sorry to seem them go.",1346479013

But a photographer produces hundreds or thousands of copyrighted works a year.<p>You might try doing your regime with the number of claims, and the company can decide how many to keep fresh, but it then leads to weird edge-cases like keeping a few things secret for now to patent later -- which is the opposite of what the patent system intends.

4462769,comment,4461038,4462618,6,0,nostrademons,,,"If you have a broad enough cultural background, eye color is not a simple discrete trait either.<p>I was eavesdropping on the conversation behind me on the bus today:<p>""What color would you describe your eyes as?"" a guy asks.<p>""Green-ish.  Something like that,"" a girl answers.<p>""Good, you didn't say hazel.  A bunch of people would've called them that.""<p>And then followed a whole long discussion about how you can basically perform hierarchical agglomerative clustering on humanity's words for colors, if you follow the words linguistically back through a few thousand years.  Apparently the first split happened between light & dark, and then broad colors like ""blue/green"" (as a single color) split off, and then modern languages broke blue & green into separate colors.<p>Some folks break them down even further, into ""cerulean"" and ""turquoise"" and ""aquamarine"" and ""royal blue"".  I've heard (from sources other than the bus conversation) that women actually have significantly more color words in their vocabulary than men do; they make distinctions where men don't.<p>So eye color is a shorthand too.  Some people just say ""light"" or ""dark"".  Others say ""brown"" or ""blue"".  Still others will break it down into ""black"", ""brown"", ""blue"", ""green"", and ""hazel"".  Once in a while you'll get a poetic type who'll say ""Eyes the color of a roiling sea, as you catch the last glimpse of sunlight before a storm rolls in.""<p>Bringing it back on topic, <i>intelligence</i> is a shorthand as well.  It stands for a bunch of directly observable characteristics, but <i>which</i> characteristics vary depending on who you ask.  Some people think an intelligent person is one with a high IQ who always does well on standardized tests.  Others think it's someone who accomplishes great things in the intellectual realm, another Tesla or Einstein.  Still others define it as a talent, and claim there're multiple intelligences, each in one desirable realm.<p>Perhaps the meta-lesson isn't about race or eye color or heritability at all, it's to drill down and ask what we actually mean by such broad characteristics.  When you make a statement such as ""IQ has a heritability of 0.8"", you're making a very specific statistical assertion (though even that's not ironclad: <i>which</i> IQ test?).  But whether that lines up with the statement of ""Intelligence is largely genetic"" depends on what you mean by ""intelligence"" and ""genetic"", both of which are very broad concepts that hide a lot of subtlety.",1346478244

Hitchens adds, Bear in mind that Mother Teresas global income is more than enough to outfit several first class clinics in Bengal. The decision not to do so... is a deliberate one.

On principle, strong painkillers were not administered even in severe cases.

But by your current standard we shouldn't count that because he stopped to sleep.<p>Anyways, you claim the point is that we have a cooling system that lets us keep going.  Wonderful.  According to <a href=""http://www.austcamel.com.au/cache/Training%20of%20Camels.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.austcamel.com.au/cache/Training%20of%20Camels.htm</a> it is not hard for a well-trained camel to run about 10 miles an hour for about 50 miles without stopping to rest.  That would mean that it is running like a human marathoner (not ultramarathoner) long enough to be running all of the way through the heat of the day, in an environment that is uncomfortably hot for people.<p>Our ability to keep running through heat does not seem to exceed what camels can do.<p>Now what is the real human upper limit by your current standard?  The longest race that I'm aware of anyone running without sleep is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfield_Sydney_to_Melbourne_Ultra_Marathon"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westfield_Sydney_to_Melbourne_U...</a>.  544 miles, and the best human time is 5 days, 2 hours, and 28 minutes.  That's about 4.44 mph.<p>I do not know of a recorded case where an animal ran that distance without stopping to rest.  Wonderful!  We win at something!<p><i>HOWEVER</i> there are animals that could start on that starting line, travel on foot, leave the humans behind in the dust, and then the humans would never, ever catch up to the animal.  Not at 100 miles.  1000 miles.  Or 10,000 miles.  Despite the fact that the animal took breaks.<p>To me that is a meaningful definition of ""better long distant runner"".  And by that definition, we are not the best.  (We are very, very good, but not the best.)",1346477031

And why would they? After investing so much into their developer, a competitor would just come along and poach them with a cushier chair and a higher salary. Everyone would rather be the poacher than the poachee, and so those ""rookies with potential"" have no where to develop that potential into talent.<p>Of course, this is all a drastic oversimplification. Rookies can get jobs, and get some experience by exposure. But developing talent effectively & efficiently takes more time & resource investment beyond just having them do work, and that's investment with an uncertain and non-immediate return. It's a tough nut to crack, but the place where I would start is figuring out how to retain your good employees, especially when the growth of their market value is faster than your company's standard career advancement path.",1346476446
