4478304,comment,4476627,4477132,2,0,fdr,,,"Well, PostgreSQL is a project -- not a company.  As a project, it is very roughly run by consensus, and that means acting strategically is not something the project as a whole does very much.<p>Sure, there are many project goals, but they're rather informed by what various correspondents of pgsql-hackers (this could be loosely coined ""the community"".  Admission is free.) seem personally willing, interested and/or funded to do.  You, too, can be a database internals engineer!  And Postgres's code is still considered crisp enough to fork for Your Very Own Database Startup (which I think is pretty remarkable -- most such stand-alone programs are typically not worth reworking), so you can waltz right on in.<p>One piece of project gridlock is that the bar is very, very high for any new code to be committed (and almost certainly released), and that goes double if you are not someone who is proven to suffer through all the bugs one is going to find over the foreseeable future and no one else is excited about doing that for you (if you submitted some excellently written, badly needed functionality, I think it would be accepted under that rationale, though, in spite of most complexity concerns).  Postgres has a long history, so ""the foreseeable future"" lasts an awfully long time.<p>Some old features like the way hash-group and hash indexes work I am reasonably confident could not be committed if submitted as-is today. (The former can't spill to disk and the latter has no crash recovery, which is why the documentation shoos you away...but some people use it?)<p>Besides bugs, there also needs to be a lot of convincing that the feature is worth whatever complexity it brings, in implementation and in user-interface.<p>In spite of that, a lot of code has gotten committed, and not without some trepidation as to the sheer amount of growth.  I used to hack a fork of Postgres a few years ago, and the project is probably about 10-20% bigger now:<p><a href=""http://www.ohloh.net/p/postgres/analyses/latest/languages_summary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ohloh.net/p/postgres/analyses/latest/languages_su...</a><p>The problem is hard, there is not even a single solution everyone agrees is the best, reliability and maintenance requirements are stringent, and even in spite of all that the project's code is growing at a rather scary clip.<p>All in all though, I think a lot of the pre-requisites for what you want are locked up in the attack on logical replication, which is ongoing in the 9.3 release cycle.",1346828032

A collection of all the businesses which might be transformed by disruptive innovation might at first sight appear to be a means of assembling the capabilities needed to manage change. In practice, it is a means of gathering together everyone who has an incentive to resist change.<p>""The executives of music companies, film studios and book publishers did not rush to embrace the opportunities offered by new channels of distribution. They saw these technological developments as threats to well established business models in which they had large personal and corporate investments. And they were right to think this. So convergence was accomplished by groups such as Apple and Amazon, which had no similar vested interests to oppose change, These companies succeeded precisely because they were outsiders.<p>""Economic growth is held back by industries where established interests are so powerful that disruptive innovation can be staved off for ever. Financial services is probably one. And education another.

I don't have anything against CVS - I regularly use git and svn. Given git's snapshot based model, I think if it's on git it's probably not neccessary to create snapshots and storing them (rar/tarballs etc.).<p>In terms of environment, I prefer to create a folder and store installers and patches (ex. environment/dev, environment/install) - specifically the most recent ones.<p>A lot of devs I know prefer to doing their development on virtual machines and backing up the entire VM (think isolated dev environment). I personally, find it too slow. I prefer having everything I need available in order to do a fresh install if required (some other OSes tend to optimize for current hardware during installation).",1346826020

4478233,comment,4476508,4477493,7,0,bad_user,,,"I do not install ad-blockers. Tried out Ad-Block Plus, but disabled it after a week. Your claim about ""most people"" installing ad-blockers as soon as they can is completely unsubstantiated.<p>I don't do that because if a website or web service doesn't respect me as a customer, pushing annoying ads down my throat, I would rather stop reading/using it, which is a form of voting with your wallet. Instead I prefer to reward loyalty to websites that are tasteful and put users interests first. As an example, such a website would be Reddit.<p>Installing ad-blockers has the reverse effect of what most users want. Ads will become more and more intrusive and difficult to block. And by visiting such a website, you're still giving that website eyeballs, you're still passing links around to your friends, you're still rewarding them for their behavior. It's like hiding the cookie jar from a fat kid, then congratulating him for being fat.<p>Installing ad-blockers is also immoral, just as software piracy is. I've seen arguments of people that don't think so, but it's hard to justify the piracy of Photoshop when there are free or cheaper alternatives available, it's hard to justify the piracy of MS Office when LibreOffice is available and it's hard to justify using Google Search with ad-blockers when there are alternatives like DDG.<p>If you don't like the ads served, just don't freaking use the service/website in question.
