It's great for getting lots of data from the same source, though I don't know about the way typical webpages are these days with so many connections to pull-in offiste resources, many of which offer the user zero value (they benefit the site owner only).  That's a problem with how people are deisgning websites.  Not something that's solved with a transmission procotol.<p>SPDY did offer a couple of new things over 1.1.<p>SPDY wants to compress headers, but I asked ""Why?""<p>What exactly are they planning to put in the headers to make them so big they need to be compressed?  Normal headers are not large.  And headers can actually be quite useful after pipelining a large amount of data when you want to carve into pieces later.  They are like record separators.<p>Another new addition was de-serialization.  But I see nothing wrong with receiving the data in the order I requested it.  If the transmission is interrupted, at least then I can restart where I left off.<p>I'm just not convinced compressing headers or de-serializing adds such a speed boost as to justify a new protocol.<p>And now, with this exploit, I don't need to even think about SPDY anymore.  Except has a potential security hole.<p>Sorry SPDY fans, but this is just my opinion as a dumb end user.  Pipelining worked just fine before SPDY.  Alas, no one used it.  Why?  Maybe because it didn't have a catchy acronym and a corporate brand behind it.  I honestly don't know.  Because it's efficient and makes perfect sense.  I used it.

4557351,comment,4556323,4556871,1,0,Humjob,,,"I agree with your statement that the social impact of discussing racial/sexual differences on a wide scale could be harmful among the masses who wouldn't take the time to ponder and process the information in a balanced and gradated manner.<p>And you could also be right that significant differences don't exist on a genotype-based level beyond different populations being vulnerable to certain diseases, knowledge for which we have incontrovertible proof. However, my intuition (and the closely guarded intuition of many sociologists, anthropologists, geneticists and other academics who don't buy into the mainstream narrative that human groups are all exactly equal despite several millenia of evolutionary branching) is that the genotype plays a larger role among observed differences than is commonly accepted. Thus, the argument that some groups of people 'do worse on average than other groups because they believe they will do worse' is not as strong as 'some groups of people do worse because they are on average inherently less capable at performing on a certain task, whatever their level of self-belief in their performance at that task,' an argument for which much evidence exists. Note that I am not stating we should change social policy or even necessarily our current cosmopolitan world view based on this information.. I'm just pointing out a fact of reality which is glossed over with emotion and fear by starry-eyed academics.<p>The counterpoint among intelligent people is to claim that it is not a fact that genotype-based differences exist and that to think they do is not only wrong but also harmful. Much the same way creationists dispute a missing link of evolution though and falsely conclude that God must have done it all, just because we don't have every possible piece of evolutionary data on the chain from single-celled amoebas to Homo Sapiens doesn't mean we can't form a highly probable link of progression between the two based on the large amount of available evidence we do have. I forget the Latin term for it so I shall refer to the above as the fallacy of ignorance: in the absence of complete enough information to satisfy a logical positivist, it is impossible to draw a likely conclusion at all.<p>Among anyone who is interested in what's true about reality, no subject should be taboo, and one should be guided by evidence and truth alone. Is this ridiculous and naive? That's a subjective value judgment, a judgment which I think becomes increasingly arbitrary the more open minded and intelligent the person thinking about the topic is.<p>tldr: Truly open minded and intelligent people (which are quite rare) who can approach controversial subjects with subtlety and even-keeled rationality should follow the truth wherever it leads them, even if it's to conclusions society deems 'improper'. Then they should hide these conclusions from almost everyone they speak with. lol.",1348298945

For instance, ""Battleship Potemkin"" is often considered one of the greatest films ever made because it was so innovative for its time, despite the fact that when you watch it now, it's easily a shitty propaganda film. It may have been a greater achievement, but as a film, it's somewhat lacking by modern standards. Likewise, MASH and Seinfeld were groundbreaking, but largely because of MASH and Seinfeld, we can and do make better television series today. I think the two biases largely cancel out.<p>This has some interesting consequences. For instance, in the restricted realm of science fiction TV, it's clear that Star Trek: The Next Generation is strictly better than the original Star Trek, just as the recent Battlestar Galactica is strictly better than TNG, because these series responded to and innovated on each other.<p>On balance, I still wouldn't say it's <i>necessarily</i> true that newer series are better than older series.

If kids were only taught creative writing and no structure, it is to be expected that a strong push on structure will give them an edge. But if they had been taught only structure from the start, insisting a lot on that in high school is bound to have smaller returns (or even negative ones, if they are then very weak in creativity).",1348298194

I don't know why you think financial feeds are related to twitter, other than both being data feeds.<p>The $360k price tag is not ""implied"", it's the actual price for access to 50% of twitter's messages (see the link I posted). 100% access can only be negotiated with Twitter itself. To be fair, from the information I could find, the cheapest plan from gnip is $500/month[1], datasift is $3000/month[2], both quickly go up. That means you can't just whip up a prototype in the weekend for some new idea anymore. This pricing probably filters out 99% of the things that could be built on it, limiting them to projects with investor backing and ready business models (which twitter itself still doesn't have).<p>[1] <a href=""http://web.appstorm.net/how-to/social-media-how-to/gnip-the-social-media-goldmine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.appstorm.net/how-to/social-media-how-to/gnip-the-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://datasift.com/pricing#costs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://datasift.com/pricing#costs</a>",1348297899

It's been almost like a cult. We can always forgive people for one mistake, and for the post-Steve-Jobs era, this is the most significant. Another slip of this kind, people will start questioning Apple.""<p>Apple has done lots of mistakes in the past. I've been an user of their products for only a few years, but even so I know.<p>It's not repeated mistakes that sink a company. It's unfixed mistakes. If users will find alternatives to iOS6 map app, they will use them. It's been like only a week since the new OS version was released. Not everyone has updated yet. People have been warned.<p>And the 'apple is cult/fanboys are blind followers' argument is one of the worst. Just like when non-religious persons belittle religious persons for being irrational, blind and manipulated. Which is stupid because it's not (generally) true.<p>Many make educated and conscious decisions. Buying a product is partially an irrational decision. BUT, the fact that Apple products produce those irrational decisions is the key to understanding the quality and the design thought that went into the products. And the fact that people keep on buying them, with every new version, tells that these products are really good. It's not magic. It's an illusion. It's just good products, and it's a damn successful company.<p>Mistakes can be fixed. Fixed ideas, hardly.",1348297845

But that doesn't invalidate pg's argument about growth: you just have to use other proxies to estimate your trajectory.<p>For example, instead of active users you track a number of leads and how interested they are. Even without a single closed deal, you can measure your sales pipeline. It is an imperfect proxy for potential revenue growth, but so is daily active users for consumer internet startups.<p>Thus, if you are planning to sell an enterprise solution costing $100000, and you think you are going to make these kind of deals a few times a year in the beginning, then you use your sales pipeline measurements to estimate your growth with a finer granularity than a big sale now and then.",1348297834
