4525448,comment,4524447,4525391,2,0,Jach,,,"So you assert you're further along the path with respect to the nature of wisdom (or am I misunderstanding you?), but you have provided no evidence to suggest whether that's really the case or whether you have actually gone off in the brush mistakenly thinking you are getting further ahead. There's an aphorism that comes to mind: ""The great menace to progress is not ignorance but the illusion of knowledge."" As I alluded to above, I've thought the same thing about ""I used to do that.."", albeit with a shorter time interval. When I think it these days it's a warning sign, though I admit in many instances it really does seem like past me was obviously off-course and stupid, and I can see others making the same mistakes I made. What's interesting to me isn't the observation of that observation, what's interesting is what particular mistakes I think are being made. (Without elaboration, some examples include mistakes related to beliefs about Objectivism, communism, sovereignty, money, and cultures. An example where I was more correct at 13 than I was at 17 was beliefs about the nature of knowledge.)<p>So, what mistakes am I and others here making? What made your perspective change, and why are you sure your current perspective is less wrong? I've given some reasons for why I believe what I believe, how about you?",1347687881

4525445,comment,4523611,4524309,2,0,zemo,,,"it depends on what your goal is.<p>A language is just one tool in your toolset.  I love using Go very much, but I would recommend learning on Python.  There's much more literature out there, more people you know will know it, and if you are looking for work, there are effectively zero entry-level programming jobs in Go.<p>The reason you keep hearing about Go is that it just very recently hit its 1.0 release, so it it a comparatively new language, and it's just a topic of conversation.  Talking about Python isn't really newsworthy in the same way, because for most people, it's just a fact of everyday life.  Go, however, is this new thing that's a little mysterious, that most people haven't tried yet.<p>Have you ever heard the phrase ""you can never really know yourself until you know others""?  Well, that's true of programming languages, too;  learning new languages can help you to write better code in a language you were already familiar with.  Learning new languages is great practice for any programmer.<p>But to start, I would just stick with Python and write some things that make you happy.  That's the most important part; to figure out how to use code to make yourself happy.  Which language you use is really just an implementation detail.",1347687877

Static typing without parametric polymorphism is extremely retrograde -- like Java in the 90's.<p>I've read rsc's essays on adding parametric polymorphism to Go -- I'm not saying it's a ""duh -- just add parametric polymorphism"".

4525438,comment,4523380,4524952,2,0,Avitas,,,"I wasn't thinking about directly sending Uniloc, its officers or its investors feedback.<p>After reading the article, I immediately thought of how I would feel and what I would do. I have had some experience with having a ""diamond"" that I had spent years figuratively cutting and polishing suddenly smashed to bits. But, my metaphorical diamond is not of the same scale as the original author's corporation. I didn't see it coming and it only amounted to a loss of a few thousand dollars. If I knew months or years beforehand that someone was building a case for some wild claims about my supposed mega-diamond that were false (e.g., the original diamond was theirs and was stolen even though I personally mined the rough diamond with valid mineral rights), but that those claims were going to be presented in a courtroom where I was at a significant disadvantage, I would want to explore plans of defense that were reasonably complete.<p>Given my inexperience in these matters, I also would really appreciate and perhaps greatly benefit from help. It could even be help in a form that might first appear meaningless without perspective that was later provided by future developments or other information.<p>Would I fantasize that some heavy hitters in the media would investigate and perhaps assist with informing the public of my plight and the plight of others who are increasingly victimized by these tricky diamond thieves or patent trolls? Sure. Should someone from the media want to start investigating exactly what is happening in this case, it would be nice if one of the first hits they see is this Hacker News thread. The opinions and details contained herein--the who, what, how, why, where, etc--might be quite helpful if someone digs up a small nugget that leads to something bigger. There may be (or there may not be) several obvious items that are just under the surface of this matter that just need some bits to come to light before the dots can be connected.<p>It's possible that we are unaware of some real eye-opening items relating to this matter that someone just needs to dig a bit to find within the mountain of publically available information. Has Uniloc intentionally targetted a very specific corporate demographic? Has Uniloc already successfully settled with thousands or tens of thousands of small companies already with just some persistent and carefully-worded threats?<p>Then, there's the matter I originally bought up. Should the individuals behind this be subject to public scrutiny that would normally only be expected for people like senatorial, mayoral or presidential political candidates? If this were my diamond that was going to be taken from me and I had time to do something, I think I would agree with this level of scrutiny. Would I want to let the perpetrators of these legal maneuvers grow in their direct and indirect dealings that appeared to be directly harming me? No. I don't think it's wrong to look at publically available information if there may be some aspect of that public information that might be helpful. Why not know every single thing that is possible to know? If this were happening to me, I would feel remiss if I did not pursue perfectly legal and reasonable avenues of investigation.<p>In addition, the information gathered and communicated during investigation can be used by others. There are so many obvious ways in which those involved can be discouraged from doing these things. I'm talking about using gathered information in the most obvious ways such as:<p>* Abstaining from the purchase of products or services from:<p>- those bringing lawsuits<p>- other organizations which are owned by the principals and/or investors (e.g., a restaurant owned jointly officer X and spouse)<p>- other organizations which funded/are funding and/or assisting them<p>Before any of this can be done, some basic investigation has to be done... search, identify and communicate any and all public information which might be of use to reporters, the writer of the original article or other HN users which are trying to help.",1347687636

I've written a linux kernel patch (rejected), toy compilers, and the two big no-nos of software development ( 1: Writing your own lock-free code, and 2: Writing a string library, both of which went successfully into production ).  I've built my own microprocessor from NAND gates, and wrote the microcode instruction set to go with it.  I've studied VLSI (ages ago), but I've never dug into AI topics.<p>There is one way in which I feel handicapped compared to my colleagues, which is that I find it generally hard to grab a book on a programming topic and read it cover-to-cover (The same goes for taking classes).  I've got to get a development environment up, see how I can break the 'examples', and generally abandon the book to doing my own thing before I get more than a third of the way through.<p>On the other hand, every time I've worked with more classically trained developers on real projects (and all the cruft that goes with it), I always find that there are corners of the code base that none of them understand, and no one ventures in to find out what's wrong.<p>Myself, I need to understand how a system works in order to work on it, so I always dig, and tweak here, or tweak there, and so I tend to learn full systems much quicker than my colleagues.<p>In the end, it's a trade-off, but it's how I work, so I guess I'm stuck with it.",1347687432

I started with 3600IU for a few months and when I started feeling more energetic and cheerful dropped down to 2600 (2x 1000IU + 600IU & calcium). I get outside quite a bit, but in Vancouver WA the skies are overcast a lot and the low sun angle means you can't get enough for vitamin D needs. I also take a probiotic, an anti-oxidant, a fish oil and a green tea supplement. My diet is mostly paleo. My ancestry is northern European.<p>For reference, you need to take 50,000IU for several months to develop toxicity (ref: <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vitamin-d-toxicity/AN02008"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/vitamin-d-toxicity/AN02008</a>). If you are pale skinned and don't spend a lot of time in the sun, you are much more likely to be deficient.<p>If you really want to see where you're at, have your doctor do a blood test, or go get a micro-nutrient test <a href=""http://www.spectracell.com/mnt/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spectracell.com/mnt/</a>",1347686410

In tech industry, especially in software engineering field, people switch jobs fast. really fast. All my colleagues switch jobs every 2-3 years. For companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple, this is not good.

4525394,comment,4524837,4525380,6,0,w1ntermute,,,"The whole point of that article I linked <i>is</i> that things like hardline Islamism <i>can't</i> be combated through the use of movies. From that same article:<p>> Pakistans ideology is based on Islamic nationalism where it views itself as part of a greater Ummah, but is certainly not recognized by the members of the Ummah as its leader. <i>In other words, Pakistan does not have native ownership over its own ideology</i>, which inevitably leads to Pakistan associating itself with other, more influential members of the Ummah like Saudi Arabia and Iran, at the obvious expense of its own subcontinental origins.<p>Neither Pakistan nor India wield a significant influence in the Islamic world - that power belongs to the aforementioned Saudi Arabia and Iran. No matter what may or may not happen in Bollywood, its influence in Pakistan/Afghanistan/etc. will always be overshadowed by Saudi & Persian mullahs. The reason why mullahs from those countries have the sort of transnational power they do is because of the unifying nature of Islam, across ethnic, cultural, and linguistic boundaries.<p>But the further west you go from India, the more the ""influence"" of Bollywood declines (and it is quite rapid). Regardless of whether the top Bollywood actors are Muslim, India itself is almost 80% Hindu, and that will <i>never</i> be forgotten by those in the Middle East watching Bollywood movies.<p>Although to those of us in the West, it may be easy to lump India and the Middle East into the same ""cultural"" category, that couldn't be further from the truth. Shared ""conservative"" values only go so far, and their respective histories are quite different.",1347686203
