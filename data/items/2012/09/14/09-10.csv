4520935,comment,4520473,4520897,6,0,jrabone,,,"Most likely not performance as in rendering performance, but as in power saving; wasn't this also NVIDIA's reason for not releasing specs to Linux developers?<p>I actually have some sympathy with a hardware company in this position; if all your competitive advantage is in actually in software, open source is a tricky proposition. Nobody cares about the driver interface to the rendering pipeline any more - I imagine it's heavily dictated by the need to make open standards fast (eg. OpenGL). Power saving? That's a whole different ballgame.<p>It's a real pain that there are no useful standards for power saving - I've had to disable almost all of the cool processor features on my DAW (C-states, core parking, EIST) because they completely wreck real-time audio latencies, and cause clicks and glitches in DAW software (using external FireWire audio hardware). I notice that Cubase on Windows 7 dynamically installs a different power saving profile on startup, but presumably that means running it as Administrator, and we're back to the bad old days of running as root everywhere.",1347616743

Also by giving the software for free; when an employee leaves the company; due to his/her interest in what the software product can deliver; they become lifelong customers - buy product upgrades and related software.<p>as far as attrition goes; well I guess it is bound to happen in case of experienced employees, no matter how great the company is; 'cause as one moves up the ladder;  number of higher positions(across various teams) start to decrease.  Talented employees hungry to explore their capabilities will leave for sure due to lack of opportunity.<p>As far as people outside MS wanting to join - guess will automatically happen if MS meets their requirements(job satisfaction + money + environment). The case most generally is that a company will find a replacement for a vacant position on its terms(there may be exceptions).
