Growth drives everything in this world. Growth is why startups usually work on technologybecause ideas for fast growing companies are so rare that the best way to find new ones is to discover those recently made viable by change, and technology is the best source of rapid change. Growth is why it's a rational choice economically for so many founders to try starting a startup: growth makes the successful companies so valuable that the expected value is high even though the risk is too. Growth is why VCs want to invest in startups: not just because the returns are high but also because generating returns from capital gains is easier to manage than generating returns from dividends. Growth explains why the most successful startups take VC money even if they don't need to: it lets them choose their growth rate. And growth explains why successful startups almost invariably get acquisition offers. To acquirers a fast-growing company is not merely valuable but dangerous too.""",1348281936

If you install something that changes what happens when a text message comes in, then (barring bugs in the implementation) it is only going to happen when a text message comes in, which is likely negligible.<p>To the extent to which it is not negligible, then it should be a direct cost of the feature: if you want incoming text messages to be converted to a 3D ray-traced animation of Tom Hanks reading them aloud and uploaded to your Twitter account, that's going to take more power than, say, playing a different sound if the message contains the word ""epic"".",1348281069

He's not saying you can't still make bets on the future of a company.  What he's saying is that because of the high frequency trading, it has become largely more DIFFICULT to be a value investor due to the fact that investing in a company no longer depends solely on said company's success.<p>When high frequency trading is allowed, the price of a stock becomes influenced by the simple act of trading itself, and while it is true (as @btilly mentioned) that this enables other methods of trading like benchmarking, it discourages investing purely for the sake of supporting the company's growth.  THAT was Mark's point.

For example, you say ""reality is what it is and all the words in the world won't change it"" but when the reality in question is the words, actions, and beliefs of people we all know that that statement is categorically false.  The wrong words, the wrong discussions, the legitimisation of wrong arguments can all have a disproportionate effect and impede or even reverse some of the progress we've made.  For example, it may or may not be the case that the average XY male has an inherently slightly higher propensity for physical strength as compared to the average XX female but any time a study suggests ""yes"" or ""no"" the discussions surrounding it greatly exaggerate the potential difference discussed.  Especially with the way science is reported today, proof positive of a real difference that is still dwarfed by training would enter the public consciousness as an insurmountable gap that some would take to justify various forms of oppressing women.<p>Of course, we are talking about science and some people hold the ridiculous belief that the human element doesn't matter and we should just discuss the truth and thus everything above is irrelevant.  Except, even if we legitimize that point of view, the truth is: we don't know.  The state of the research on real, meaningful, inherent differences is largely inconclusive except for some highly specialized and specific results.  For example, it's common knowledge that the best distance runners are disproportionately often Kenyan but this doesn't take into account the relative effect from genetics, environment, and training and it also doesn't imply that being Kenyan makes you better at running.  When we look at it we can't say there's a difference between races or nationalities because we don't know that; we just know that some combination of factors has balanced the scales in an interesting fashion.  With the exception of certain disease/condition frequencies, this is some of the <i>best</i> data we have for real differences between races or sexes.  Generally speaking, even if we could do a study to compare everybody alive now from group A with everybody alive now from group B (say all XY-males with all XX-females) and properly accounted for other variables and measured a real difference we still have no way of knowing where the differences come from as far as ""nature"" or ""nurture"" goes.<p>Furthermore, there are adequate studies suggesting that, regardless of natural tendencies, the environmental/training effect can be greatly affected just by the simple act of telling someone they can or cannot do something or fit some role.  That is, it might be the case that American XY-males today are better (by whatever quantitative measure) at math and science than American XX-females today strictly by environmental factors and that by repeating ""men are better at math than women"" we are exacerbating and continuing this problem.<p>Now, all this said, it shouldn't be the case that all differences are strictly off-limits since, for example, there is a high incidence of lactose intolerance among south Asians and an incredibly low incidence among northern Europeans so menus for both groups absent other information would likely have necessary differences.  And, given an equal society with a different mind towards things data on other differences might be interesting.  But, widely speaking, discussions on potential differences is necessarily an area of little to no information and has high potential to be actively harmful to society.",1348280119

I like this because I can take something like 'Samsung TV Remote' which looks like 'Sams...ote' on my phone and change it to ""TV Remote""<p>3) BrowserChanger: This allows me to install Google Chrome as my browser, and open all URLs by default in Chrome instead of safari (So I get all my synced bookmarks, etc. Opening a link from another app like Alien Blue, will use chrome instead of safari, as well as 'home screen' shortcuts)<p>4) ColoredKnob: Allows you to change the 'scroll to unlock' icon colour and size.<p>5) MissionBoard: Triple-Home-Click will open a MissionControl style background-app selector which shows screenshots of the apps in their current state on a nice background.<p>6) Torch: Adds a nice little icon next to the clock on the lock screen to enable flashlight torch.<p>7) Weather Icon: Causes the 'Weather' app to display the actual weather with icon and temperature. Runs based on the first weather screen, which can be set to 'local weather'.<p>8) Zeppelin: Customise the carrier logo. You can choose from things like the apple icon and countless others, which I like instead of having a giant ""YES OPTUS"" on my screen.<p>9) Adblock: Blocks ads.<p>10) SBSettings: Allows me to swipe my status bar to quickly toggle options like 3G / Wifi / Brightness. etc. You can also download themes to make this look more like a iOS native application.<p>11) NoNewsIsGoodNews: Disables the Newsstand icon which I have NEVER used in iOS.<p>12) Springflash: Enables me to double-tap the power button for a torch.. Not really necessary but I like it.<p>13) YTOpener: Automatically opens any youtube links in the new Google YouTube app. Works awesomely well.<p>14) LSMusicGestures: Adds swipe gestures for music controls to my lock screen. I love this as I dont have ipod controls on my car stereo. It allows me to do things like swipe to skip song, or double-tap to pause/resume a song.

Decentralization will benefit other <i>organizations</i>, such government agencies, companies, non-profits, NGOs, etc. These organizations most likely have other services running on either their own infrastructure or they have some one else paid to host it. They benefit by retaining control of the namespace and ability to post a message without relying on a centralized service.",1348279227
