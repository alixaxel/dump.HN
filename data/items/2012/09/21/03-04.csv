Experienced ones don't care about php, they have commercial projects in there.<p>> Plus, a lot of designers are already spending their time working for free anyway. If you dont believe me, just look at the number of Instagram redesigns or iTunes icons on Dribbble.<p>Hey, let's try to find a programmer who will code your website for free. Lots of them do stuff for free anyway, just look on github and bitbucket.<p>Now seriously (I am aware there are a lot of generalizations in there, but I think they are not far from the most common):<p>The thing is, just like coders publish opensource, designers publish icons and redux because it's their cause, their branch, their market. And just like you wouldn't code a random designer's project while publishing lots of libraries for other programmers, he won't design yours while publishing fonts and icons elswhere to prove something.<p>Second, while programming in commitee works (in general), webdesign by commitee doesn't and always results in crap. And experienced designers have the 'my way or the highway' approach anyway.<p>Third, most designers just don't get opensource quite well, while most opensource gurus just don't get design quite well. The former ones don't feel why they should do it, the latter ones don't feel the need to make use of the ones who would even if they are there.<p>If a designer finds a programmer who will work for free, 99% chance he's very unexperienced. The same comes to getting a designer for free.<p>ps. let's see how the Django redesign works out <a href=""https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/django-developers/2Xy7SZAOc7E"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/django-de...</a>",1348199629

There are no such issues with the Google Maps app on Android (made by Google) - it gives the same results as the website. In fact, it prominently displays several route options, along with their times and costs, just as in Tokyo.

Keyless operations are more of a gray area of policy rather than security. For example, should hashing require TLS? I think not, since there are non-crypto-but-still-useful applications of cryptographic hashes and random numbers (eg: name-based or PRNG-based UUIDs as described in RFC 4122). However, splitting the interface into TLS and HTTP segments is something that has its own issues.<p>It's possible that a compromise might be the ""Secure Cookie"" equivalent of specifying policy (HTTPS-only) when creating or importing keys, but I hope it doesn't come to that.<p>That said, I'm also a big proponent of requiring some sort of sane CSP settings to also narrow the scope of the API usage ( <a href=""http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/track/issues/21"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/2012/webcrypto/track/issues/21</a> ), but that remains an open issue.",1348199199
