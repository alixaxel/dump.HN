3937649,comment,3935598,3937340,3,0,sirclueless,,,"I think there really is no silver bullet here. In many cases, a particular problem has a simple solution with a lot of state. To fully specify a pure function on that much state, you may need a lot of working memory.<p>In certain cases, you may be able to reduce the size of working memory through recursion or related techniques: ""The red-black tree T without node X is the subtree on the left without node X if ... possibly rotated based on the color of the top node in subtree T' ...""<p>But sometimes, it really is simpler to just do things imperatively with mutable state: ""First recurse into subtrees until you find node X. Then, unlink it from its parent. ... Rotate if its color is red. Repeat with parent node ...""<p>There are many things that are strictly simpler with mutable state. Most prominently I think are hash tables, but there are others. Not all programs are best-described as a composition of maps, folds, and filters.",1336366676

Context via Wikipedia:<p>>>Henry Blodget (born 1966) is an American former equity research analyst, currently banned from the securities industry, who was senior Internet analyst for CIBC Oppenheimer during the dot-com bubble and the head of the global Internet research team at Merrill Lynch. Blodget is now the editor and CEO of The Business Insider, a business news and analysis site, and a host of Yahoo Daily Ticker, a finance show on Yahoo.<p>>>Blodget received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Yale University and began his career as a freelance journalist and was a proofreader for Harper's Magazine. In 1994, Blodget joined the corporate finance training program at Prudential Securities, and, two years later, moved to Oppenheimer & Co. in equity research. In October 1998, he predicted that Amazon.com's stock price would hit a pre-split price of $400 (which it did a month later, gaining 128%).<p>>>This call received significant media attention, and, two months later, he accepted a position at Merrill Lynch. In early 2000, days before the dot-com bubble burst, Blodget personally invested $700,000 in tech stocks, only to lose most of it in the years that followed. In 2001, he accepted a buyout offer from Merrill Lynch and left the firm.<p>>>In 2002, then New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, published Merrill Lynch e-mails in which Blodget gave assessments about stocks which conflicted with what was publicly published. In 2003, he was charged with civil securities fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He agreed to a permanent ban from the securities industry and paid a $2 million fine plus a $2 million disgorgement.""<p>Link: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Blodget"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Blodget</a>",1336365944

In this case, you will still want to get one of those variations indexed, and it might not matter which one.<p>As described, of course, this is both ""cloaking"" and not: the site is not treating GoogleBot differently than any other visiter on purpose, it is simply going to end up doing that because GoogleBot has different behavior on the site than a normal user, so it will learn and optimize (possibly somewhat randomly or uselessly) from this and end up treating that user differently than one coming from Internet Explorer (which may very well represent a different demographic of user).<p>It sadly does not seem like this advanced usage of testing is allowed by Google.",1336365826

I like Hacker News for its capacity to impart that fascinating tidbit about technological advances, exciting advances in physics and science, and DIY articles from embedded projects to mathematical nuggets.<p>Since its decline as an icon, Slashdot is much less interesting than the news section that begins each issue of Science magazine, or any issue of Physics Today.  What about Phys.org?  Why does it have such a terrible reputation here?  Admittedly, the comments were why I always went to Slashdot, and Phys.org comments seem to be made mostly by amateurs and spectators with too much time on their hands (think: armchair Star Trek physicists).<p>I'm not the only one feeling this way.

3937577,comment,3936225,3936225,12,0,spiredigital,,,"Mkelley  Drop shipping has been mentioned a few time, and I wanted to give you my thoughts on the business model.<p>I've had a lot of success with drop shipping eCommerce and have been doing it full-time for more than 4 years. Robryan is right to some extent - it can be harder than it looks - but with some dedication and a good niche, it's a great way to create online income.  A few tips from my own experience:<p>- Picking a niche where you can add value is crucial.  The more complex niches are often best as these are the ones where you can create the most educational content related to your products.  If you aren't able to offer some kind of value-added information, you have to compete on price.  And I don't recommend that.<p>- Finding good supplier(s) is really important, and I highly recommend only getting into a market if you have TWO suppliers.  As Robryan alluded to, it can be difficult to keep warehouse inventory synced up with your website, which is why I ALWAYS use multiple suppliers with overlapping product lines.  The vast majority of the time Supplier A doesn't have an item, I can get it shipped from Supplier B.<p>- Multiple suppliers prevents you from being totally dependent on one source of inventory.  It also gives you geographic diversity, allowing you to save on shipping costs - and reduce transit time - by routing orders through the warehouse closest to your customer.<p>-  Not seeing the physical products you sell CAN be a challenge, and it's often a good idea to order a few of your best sellers.  However, I can tell you from personal experience it's possible to become an expert for a line of products that you've never touched.  With the wealth of product pictures, reviews and information online you really don't have to touch something to know a lot about it.  As your business grows, you'll quickly learn the ins-and-outs of the niche through your customers experiences, opinions and problems.<p>- You WILL need to be be good at - or willing to learn - marketing and SEO.  PPC advertising has gotten so expensive that you won't be able to make much of a profit using that as your primary traffic driver.  PPC is a great tool early on to drive some traffic and make sure it's converting at a reasonable level, but long-term you'll need to build organic traffic if you want to make any serious money.<p>- One of my favorite aspects of eCommerce is that it's a great model for automated, passive income.  If you invest a LOT of time up-front in building an information rich-store and market it well, the operations side of the business (fulfilling orders, dealing with returns, solving customer problems) is fairly simple to outsource.  I recently took a 7 month working vacation to travel around-the-world while my team back home managed the business.  Did it require a lot of up-front work?  Absolutely.  But I believe the long-term ROI (return on investment) with eCommerce beats many other business  models.<p>I'm not sure if eCommerce would be the right path for your wife, but I hope it is helpful!  If you're interested in learning more, I blog about building eCommerce stores and would recommend a post detailing how I got started:<p><a href=""http://www.ecommercefuel.com/my-corporate-escape-story/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecommercefuel.com/my-corporate-escape-story/</a><p>I also spent the last week working on a 50+ page eBook that covers how I pick a niche, find suppliers and evaluate market demand and competition.  It's a free resource I'll be giving away on the blog in the next few weeks, and would be happy to send you a copy if you're interested.
