Promoting these comments, or even not downvoting them creates a culture where these comments become accepted. I can see a comment like this (if upvoted) easily starting one of those ""pun trains"" commonly seen on reddit.<p>I don't see anything specifically wrong with the ironic humor of the comment, HN does need to lighten up sometimes, but if we let one of these get upvoted... it will only lead to many more by precedent. The line has to be drawn somewhere. I personally wouldn't want to see a HN where each topic has 10+ ""witty/ironic/humorous"" comments. I go to reddit for that.",1336877795

These engines have proven that you don't need pointers or explicit types to be an efficient Javascript implementation.<p>The only reason that I can see for these types of features like explicit types and pointers are to support systems programming, where they are required for certain activities (probably less that you would think though).  For that, I would really love to see a CoffeeScript with those features available for use optionally.  I think to do that you would want to find a way to compile directly to machine code or assembly or LLVM bytecode or something like that.",1336877740

Isn't the GC still going to run, except now it has to walk every single cell in your memory arena every time, defeating the very heuristics that GCs use to reduce pauses?<p>Yes, this eliminates GC pauses.<p>The JS GC will only run if allocations occur, allocations in the sense of actual JS objects. If you do malloc which amounts to manually handling indexes in a single array, no JS objects are created and destroyed.<p>Also, JS GC's would not walk the memory arena. The memory arena is just an array of numbers, it does not contain native JS references which is what the JS GC traces.",1336877678

This is supposed to make developing Clang easier (since you don't have to understand so much), allowing optimizations to be tested and added easier.<p>On the user side, Clang is well known for providing much better error messages. Some error messages will even suggest possible fixes (you might get something like ""Can't assign a pointer to a something, did you mean *pointer?"").<p>The GCC guys have been improving their compiler for a long time, and over the last few years they have been working hard to make GCC easier to work on and optimize.

I think that part of what may be driving that is the dramatic increase in the number of web, mobile and desktop applications and devices.  I think that there are a lot more programmers, especially targeting consumer applications.  I also think that part of this is the result of the rise of web development and having quite a lot of people with a web design background moving into application development/design which has infused more aesthetic and marketing attention.<p>When there are a (large) number of different applications and devices with the same important features for around the same ballpark amount of money, details that are secondary to primary function become more important for making a product stand out.  Previously, much of application development was focused on providing more and better features.<p>Now, when there are already two or three or a hundred applications in most niches, developers have to invest their time in things like usability, appearance and marketing, or there is a good chance that a very small percentage of the population will learn of the existence of their application.<p>If there were really only one application available to perform a key function in someone's life, they would be less inclined to dismiss it if they found the color scheme or font distasteful or difficult to read or menu hard to navigate.",1336876564

3965831,comment,3965713,3965713,8,0,geoffschmidt,,,"Why does malloc take a byte count, just to divide it by sizeof(u32)? Why not embrace the fact that natural ""word"" in the JavaScript VM is a boxed value that stores an int, float, or string, and define sizeof(u8) === sizeof(u16) === sizeof(u32) === 1? Unless you really want each cell in your memory arena to literally emulate a byte and always store a value between 0 and 255?<p>In a similar vein, why not use the native JavaScript object type to back the structs? This will cooperate nicely with the inline caching in typical JavaScript JITs. The result will be native assembler that indexes directly into the structs in the way you'd hope, since your static typing system forces every object reference to be monomorphic.<p>Does this language actually eliminate GC pauses? Isn't the GC still going to run, except now it has to walk every single cell in your memory arena every time, defeating the very heuristics that GCs use to reduce pauses?<p>There's definitely something alluring about the static typing, but I'm less sold on the manual memory management. Maybe there is a way that the language could help you generate less garbage, without actually requiring you to manually control the lifetime of each object?<p>From your linked-list example, it's eminently clear that it needs a C++-style template system and a port of the STL :) If you wrote a C-to-*JS translator, you could hypothetically use a pre-existing cfront (C++-to-C translator) and STL implementation to get that working.",1336875810

If you look at parliamentary countries with low thresholds, you see politics like Israel's.  You have three major parties (Labor, Kadima, and Likud), and a host of minor parties with a few seats.

The monopoly that Adobe has in this industry runs far deeper than you know. Every aspect of printing, from the creative applications, to the press rasterization technology is becoming Adobe from top to bottom.<p>This deep integration is only growing. There is literally nothing in sight that can come remotely close to what Abode provides. If the industry were still predominantly Postscript, there might be a chance. As it is, all the major RIP manufacturers are moving to the Adobe PDF engine, which can rasterize a PDF to the press, natively, without a Postscript flattening stage. Every other competitor out there who is currently using their own Postscript engine (and really, there are only three significant engines out there: Ghostscript, Global Graphics JAWS, and EFI Fiery) has also moved to Adobe, standard.<p>To get there we would need something that could replace PDF. But there is nothing. PDF is no longer Postscript. Postscript is still there, and can still be distilled into a PDF, but a PDF is capable of doing things that Postscript cannot do (and I'm not talking about any of the forms, scripting, video stuff). Perhaps EFI or Global Graphics have something in the works. I don't think so. If they did, EFI wouldn't be putting Adobe Extreme in their Fiery RIPs, and all the various RIPs that are built around the JAWS engine (Xitron, Harlequin, Onyx, Colorburst, Wasatch, Colorgate) would be looking to Global Graphics for a PDF engine. But they aren't. They are all going to Adobe.<p>Quark Xpress is dead. Corel is dead. Adobe has the industry by the balls, and I do not see that changing any time soon.",1336875045
