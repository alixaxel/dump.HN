Microsoft would never compromise their branding. They're not THAT desperate yet, and their still in a stronger position than Facebook in terms of having money to throw around.<p>> phone functionality swapped with a custom Skype UI (integrated with Facebook contacts)<p>You'll never get the carriers to agree with that. Not yet. Even Apple couldn't do it.<p>> For data service, Facebook makes a deal with one carrier in every region on Earth to become a ""dumb pipe"" of unlimited 4G/3G, negotiates a reasonable globally consistent rate, and handles billing with users (acting as a middleman between users and carriers, effectively becoming its own carrier with borrowed infrastructure).<p>Again, for the same reason, it's extremely unlikely that carriers would agree to this on any level. Not yet. They've still got a few dying gasps yet.<p>> In the end, we get a Facebook-controlled and Facebook-powered ""Facebook Phone"" which shuns legacy telephony technology and seamlessly moves between regional 3G/4G and Wi-Fi networks (and makes Facebook, Microsoft, and Nokia a ton of money).<p>I still disagree that Facebook are in any position to heavy-hand away the branding of either Microsoft or Nokia. Especially Microsoft. They're not going to hand over the OS they spent a lot of effort developing for no recognition, even if it makes them tonnes of money in licensing.<p>It's a good idea, but I don't think it's likely at all in this climate.",1338251831

I'm not sure there's any one particular thing. For me, some of the things I've described already I think are very important. I think really an obsessive nature with respect to the quality of the product is very important and so being an obsessive compulsive is a good thing in this context. Really liking what you do, whatever area that you get into, even if you're the best of the best, there's always a chance of failure so I think it's important that you really like whatever you're doing. If you don't like it, life is too short. I'd say also, if you like what you're doing, you think about it even when you're not working.

4035492,comment,4034528,4034528,14,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>If the police are utilizing these conversations, then the issue is, where does it stop? he said.</i><p>Libertarians consistently make slippery-slope arguments when most everybody else is just happy that some immediate problem is solved. This line of debate is freaking getting old, and I'm the first person to do it.<p>The problem is that it always <i>is</i> a slippery slope. No bullshit. Changes take place over years or decades, so there's no single time you can raise an alarm. Right now it's gunshots. Next it will be car sounds -- estimating speeders and the conditions for traffic accidents. Then somebody will work out screaming. Then, perhaps conversations. And let's not forget that the systems will be justified by talking about the horrendous inner city. In actuality the vast majority of the time these systems will be used in places nowhere like that. When you read stories like this remember that these guys are selling equipment just like any other startup. You're getting their best pitch.<p>Big cities need this stuff, so it's a good thing for them. (Although I imagine we'll just start seeing a lot of silencers). What concerns me is that 90%+ of the time there's no crime being committed, save for discharging a firearm. So there's all these thousands of ""criminals"" discharging firearms that haven't been arrested before but could be now. Yay? Is it always a good thing with the grip of the state tightens, as long as we can point to something good coming of it?<p>Hopefully the cops will be so overloaded with gunshots they'll ignore the system and use it only for forensic purposes. But I doubt it. Instead I imagine we'll see these discharge numbers added to the crime reports for cities in an effort to secure more funding for even more police presence. Whether that's a good thing or not is debatable. There's obviously a real problem in Chicago and several other cities, but the rest of the country not so much.",1338251760

A lot of instruments people use every day would be affected by major changes in the magnetic field.<p>2. The magnetic field could completely disappear and we wouldn't get bombarded by radiation. The atmosphere itself protects us from radiation. Remember all that talk in the '90s about the ozone layer and how we'd get irradiated if it disappeared? That's in the atmosphere. The magnetic field doesn't do much for that AFAIK.<p>3. Based on the same evidence that leads us to believe the polarity switches, we believe it doesn't happen quickly. We are talking about a geological timescale here. The field won't flip by the end of the year any more than a new mountain will appear by then.<p>4. I think the biggest consequence if the field suddenly flipped is that we would have to fix a lot of navigational equipment.<p>5. You're more likely to get killed by the consequences of silly superstitions  say, based off a calendar ending on a particular date  than you are from a magnetic field polarity reversal.",1338250358

Maybe someone here knows better?<p>I'd assume the NSA's fabrication capability is more on the scale of the pilot plants fabs build at each new process scale. Some universities certainly have fabrication equipment testbeds as well, so the NSA effort may be more that modest scale.<p>If I were tasked with the problems the NSA faces, I think I'd at least focus in on:<p>1. CMOS reverse engineering equipment that can shave down dies, image and analyze the structures, etc.<p>2. Small scale fabrication for extremely sensitive infrastructure. These roles probably aren't performance critical. Eg if you have some microcontroller that plays a role in say nuclear weapon arming protocols, you need that to be pretty much beyond suspicion.<p>3. Some way of sampling commodity parts for unexpected behavior non-destructively. If this could be done efficiently enough, you could use it in combination with #1 to get reasonable confidence for off the shelf parts.<p>One thing I'd suspect is that if the NSA did find highly targeted flaws they probably wouldn't disseminate that fact unless absolutely necessary. Keep an adversary using a strategy you know rather than provoking improvement.<p>Personally I doubt the NSA forces backdoors into commodity chips. In theory there might be some way of introducing a flaw that would cripple specific large computations like crypto-analysis of a particular code, or biasing a particular random number generator. But that just seems too likely to backfire.<p>I'd always thought it was interesting that the pentium FDIV bug was most easily found by code calculating twin primes. But there may be a mundane explanation for that rather than cloak and dagger stuff.",1338250227
4035444,comment,4034820,4035307,1,0,CoolGuySteve,,,"DPI is very different though, a screen sub pixel can vary in luminescence (typically index in most displays with 6bits of accuracy, minus crappy colour gamut on the display) whereas a printed dot is limited to the ink colours used.<p>Some printers overlap dots, print thicker dots, and have other tricks to work around this aspect. I don't know as much about this area, I've worked mostly in graphics, but my understanding is that because the colour gamut for each printed 'pixel' is less expressive, you need more dots in the same area to get a similar result.<p>Furthermore, dpi expresses printed 'dots' whereas a pixel on most displays can be considered three fixed 'dots', one for each display channel.  Although lately, some LCD substrates are cheating a little and displaying only 2 subchannels per pixel.<p>Anyways, that's everything I know about dpi, as I said, I'm more versed in video rather than printing.  So take this with a grain of salt:  I think you need to multiply PPI by 3 to get DPI, ignoring cleverness on the part of either display or printer manufacturers.",1338250167

I see the same effect as in juriga's screenshot at the top, and in Firefox I also see a lot of overlapping text in the area alongside the full stack graphic. My defaults are font size 18px, monospace 16px, minimum 10px; maybe that will help you to reproduce the problem.<p>As for the graphic itself and the accompanying text, as with much of the document, I think the idea could probably work but I'm not wild about the current execution. I won't repeat things others have already said in detail, but FWIW I agree with the people who have suggested that the graphics lack a common visual style and the text sizes lack a clear hierarchy.<p><i>I figured the industry experience covered some of this</i><p>Yes and no. If it's me, and maybe I've got past the initial scan and now I'm looking for more details to prepare for an interview, I'd like at least a rough idea of your level with any relevant skills you're claiming. That means, broadly speaking, how much experience in total and how recently you used that skill.<p>A list of buzzwords and a list of projects but no matching between them doesn't tell me which are your relatively strong skills. Unfortunately, I'm going to assume by default that none of them are particularly strong, simply because in my experience most people who list lots of skills on a CV/resume but don't highlight their particular strengths among those skills usually aren't very strong at anything.<p>If you do have relatively strong areas, particularly those that are relevant to specific job, then failing to highlight them means at best you're missing a chance to direct the interview in a way that is going to make you look good. At worst, you're going to get asked about your weaker skills and if you get caught out on the technical questions/programming test/whatever the interviewers are going to assume your other skills are all of that level.<p><i>If by 'real people' you mean recruiters, that's not my primary target audience, I have an utterly boring, scannable MS-Word document for them if needed.</i><p>I guess in that case my question is: who <i>is</i> your primary target audience for this document? If it's technical/management guys who are going to be conducting an interview once you're past the recruiters, I'd still say scannability is essential. It's totally unfair that people who are going to make decisions that could have a major effect on your life aren't necessarily going to read the whole document you've spent so much time and care preparing, but in the real world, that's often going to be the case, so you might as well play by the same rules as everyone else!",1338250133

4035430,comment,4031912,4035322,1,0,mkramlich,,,"Two citizens go to the voting booth and choose between electing candidates 1 or 2 to the Presidency. Call these citizens A and B. But at some point previous to this day both of these citizens had taken a test to gauge general intelligence. The test is not perfect but is better at ferreting out signal than having nothing at all. Here's that test (for sake of argument):<p>The test describes an apparent murder case. Here are the known facts. The victim was found dead by bullet wound. Seven different witnesses claim they saw suspect X enter the victim's house carrying a gun, then heard a gunshot, then saw suspect X leave the house and <i>flee</i> the scene. One neighborhood resident, a 90 year old man with dementia, told an officer he thinks suspect Y did it. When asked his reasons, he said, ""Because he's a bad man!"" though admits he did not personally see or hear anything directly related to the murder scene or time. The test then asks the test taker: without knowing for sure, in an omniscient way, who committed the murder, and without any additional data or evidence, who do you think is more likely to have commited the murder, suspect X or Y?<p>Citizens A and B take this test. Citizen A indicates X. Citizen B indicates Y.<p>Now someone chimes in on the Internet to say that tests are unfair and it's impossible to test for intelligence, that the government can skew tests, etc. Then election day comes. Citizen A votes for candidate 1. B votes for candidate 2. Since everyone's vote weighs the same, these two votes effectively cancel each other out.<p>Do you think that's a smart system? Do you think that system produces better or more ""fair"" results than a system in which each vote can be weighed differently? I've already obviously said which I think to be true. I just wanted to give a concrete example of how we can devise tests or filtering mechanisms that can score or filter for desirable qualities, and that the current system allows dumb votes to cancel out smart votes. The current system can be even worse than that if there are more ""dumb"" people than smart ones (where for sake of argument assume dumb/smart is a generalization across a wide set of qualities and signals.) To continue my example, what if there were a lot more people who thought like citizen B, than A? Do you think that would produce smarter results for the country? Or dumber results?<p>And yes we can objectively measure and compare between two people to determine who is more logical or well-read. Again, not in some perfect ideal way in every single possible situation -- the world is messy and imperfect -- but in enough cases and in broad enough strokes that yes we can better filter for signal over noise. I know it is possible.<p>Also the government chooses special criteria and devises lengthy and arbitrary rules already, all the time, for all sorts of things. You can't do D unless E, F and G are true. You're not allowed to do J unless you've previously done K and L. Lots of precedent, both in government and in the private business sector, clubs, pretty much everywhere in society. But for some reason when we go to the voting booth (figuratively speaking) everyone's vote counts the same. When serious money is on the line or someone's life we don't go take a poll of every Tom, Dick and Harry in your neighborhood, instead we go to experts or at least to people who we have a reasonable expectation will give us smarter, better advice than the average Joe. Suddenly when millions of lives are on the line, and trillions of dollars in spending (when it comes to voting on national-level political issues or candidates) we abandon that system and dramatically loosen and worsen our standards. I say it's a hilariously bad design. So obviously bad that perhaps it just might be <i>by</i> design and intent. But regardless, I know we can do better.
