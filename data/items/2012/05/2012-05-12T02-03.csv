And, if I'm rolling out a state infrastructure, and wondering what I can put in place for the next 10 years to serve as a foundation, you could certainly do worse than the 3945 - it's a very flexible ISR, and, all-things being equal, it's probably not worth the hassle of putting 2921s in some locations and 3945s in others.  Who knows how much bandwidth you'll want on these high-speed fiber connections 5+ years from now - the 3945 is rated for 350 megabits/second (with features), the 2921 tops out at 75 megabits.<p>Amortized over 10 years, I would have chosen the 3945 everywhere versus sticking 2921s in some places (the ISR that would have been an alternative) and 3945s in others.    Single Security Policy.  Single IOS update Policy.  Zero doubt as to what features will run in a particular location.<p>I think what most people have difficulty with is that they are comparing this decision to roll out a state communications infrastructure with the fact that they can go connect a $60 linksys wrt54G in their house and serve a dozen people without breaking a sweat.  And get wireless as well!  The issues involved in scaling that across the state, while looking to the future, and managing all that gear is a different challenge though.<p>I don't see any huge scandal here.",1336790988

People can trust authorities and each other.<p>Democracies don't foster trust. Instead, they ferment disrespect and corruption. Politicians make law to gain vote. They don't care about long term consequences. They want pork for their district, not efficient funding. That lead to distrust, fear, and non-cooperation. People wouldn't help each other if they think they're going to get screwed or the courts can't help make it right.<p>Judges are the one who are immune to democratic pressure, yet they make ruling that even politicians will follow. If they don't, they destroy the consent of the people. They destroy trust in the law.<p>Therefore, western nations are powerful and rich in spite of democracy and elected officials. They are held together by independent judges and jurors.<p>Signapore and South Korea like to believe that their interventions help. Maybe that's not true at all. Perhaps, they achieve their wealth through not being so corrupted.<p>This leads to a prediction:<p>China and India will never be as prosperous as Japan, South Korea, the United States, or Western Europe if their bureaucracies are inefficient and corrupt.<p>How will this manifest? Their purchasing power will always be lower. Their military will be defeated in wars. They will never be as innovative. Maybe, they will never win any football championship. Maybe their GDP will never quite dwarf the US.<p>Or maybe they will surpass ours, in spite of the corruption and evilness of their officials.

3962403,comment,3962166,3962330,3,0,nostrademons,,,"I think a lot of that is because of an overly narrow and idealistic picture of success.<p>I remember thinking in college that I'd half-ass my coursework so I could go do a major open-source project so that I'd have a kick-ass resume when I entered the working world.  The project was nowhere near as kick-ass as I hoped (I did the software for fictionalley.org), but it did serve 100k people or so, and I didn't have any trouble getting jobs.  So that was something, at least.<p>Then I thought I'd work my tail off for a few years so I could found a startup and get rich.  Well, I did work my tail off, and I founded a startup, but I just didn't have the skills yet to take it across the finish line.  It didn't make me rich, it failed without accomplishment.  But I did get hired by Google afterwards, and I guess that's a decent consolation prize.  So that was something, at least.<p>And then once I'd been at Google for 9 months, I heard about this cool new project to completely redesign the search page from the ground up.  At the time (2009), this was viewed as crazily ambitious: remember that the main Google SRP basically had not changed in look & feel since 2000.  We launched in May 2010, after a long hard slog, and we felt really good about ourselves for a while.  But then Google Instant launched that summer and completely overshadowed us, and the page was completely overhauled <i>again</i> in the summer of 2011, so the UI we slaved over lasted barely a year.  We each got reputations internally as kick-ass devs that got stuff done, though, and were given a fair amount of latitude to pick our next projects, and had our pictures in BusinessWeek, and once in a while somebody even remembers the Google Search UI from 2010-2011.  So that was something, at least.<p>I'm still looking for the big success that'll make it all worthwhile.  I'm beginning to think that it doesn't really exist, that no matter how ""successful"" I am by external metrics, I'll always be chasing the next big thing.  And increasingly, I'm beginning to think that the real big success was just the fun I've had hanging out with other people.  That can sometimes be in the context of work, or it can sometimes be in the context of play.  But somehow I think it matters a lot more than 80 hour weeks that usually go for naught anyway.  (Luckily, I haven't really put in that many 80-hour weeks.  In crunch time I might do up to about 60, but for the most part I work reasonable hours and spend my free time with friends.)",1336788035
