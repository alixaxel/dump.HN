Doesn't this depend on the database we're talking about?<p>Something like Big Table is pretty good at storing small blobs. It's also pretty good at scaling, so you should never really have to delete ""usage statistics, metrics, GPS locations, session data"" or anything really.<p>Regarding logs, I completely agree. Something like tornado + scribe + s3 works quite well. (check out <a href=""https://github.com/gregbayer/logcatcher"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gregbayer/logcatcher</a>) But then EMR + Scribe can be used to access it like a db.",1335927580

Phone companies were forced to allow 3rd party phones on their network. So where/are mobile companies as far as I know. Car companies are require to honor car warranties even if you change out the car stereo AFAIK.<p>Is there some reason similar rules don't apply to Apple (and Nintendo, and Sony, and Microsoft)?",1335927435

3917426,comment,3916497,3917141,11,0,gnaritas,,,"> reads/writes on a DB are often much faster which is why we use DB systems.<p>Not really.  We use db's because file systems aren't ACID and we like to not lose data, and we like to be able to query data, and because we like multiple machines having access to that data.  But the file system is generally much faster, especially when appending something like a log (yea, db's do that too, that's beside the point).<p>> but to think that writing small chunks of data to a file system is always faster than a DB is to misunderstand what DBs do and when and why they are useful.<p>I don't think so.

3917419,comment,3906941,3907160,2,0,saurik,,,"I do most of my browsing on my iPhone (where honestly GitHub is so slow as to be unusable, even on an iPhone 4S). On my laptop (a 2010 11"" MacBook Air) I use Chrome.<p>I find the experience of the first page load to be slow, and clicking links between different code views to be agonizing as it does some trendy-but-slow AJAX update with horizontal transition animation to the next page. I am not able to check right now (as I'm on my iPhone: left laptop at home), but I also remember the code browser getting tripped up of you want to do fast forward/back interactions: sometimes it would even just get wedged, but the core performance problem is simply that it doesn't take advantage of the browser's page cache and instead rebuilds the DOM in JavaScript and runs another useless animation every time you navigate. :(<p>Finally, if there is a folder with a lot of files in it (such as the definition files for Homebrew, which I'm occasionally in a position where I need something quickly verified or checked) you are pretty much screwed (and on MobileSafari I've had the browser run out of memory and simply crash).<p>The result is that it is infinitely easier to just check the code out and edit it locally (yes: even and especially so on an iPhone, where git itself works great). In addition to having clicking through the code be reasonably fast, you have much more powerful search operations available.<p>(edit:) Back at my laptop (aforementioned Air with Chrome), and to demonstrate part of the problem: go to the Formula folder for Homebrew, click any file, and then hit back. This takes <i>multiple seconds</i> to occur: hitting back is something that you are going to do constantly while browsing files, and is something that normally is instantaneous.<p><a href=""https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/tree/master/Library/Formula</a><p>The reason for this is that the mechanism GitHub is using to supposedly speed up browsing (and I take severe issue with this: the surrounding content and resources should entirely be in the request cache, and there is almost no dynamic content on the page, so there should be more intelligent ways of improving the performance for clicking forward that are server-side) totally ruins the page cache.<p>To be clear: the page cache is not the same as the request cache. The page cache is what is used when the user hits back or forward, and it stores all of the state associated with a rendered page. This way, when you click a link, you don't destroy all of that work, and when you hit back you get the previous contents as fast as possible.<p><a href=""http://www.webkit.org/blog/427/webkit-page-cache-i-the-basics/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webkit.org/blog/427/webkit-page-cache-i-the-basic...</a><p>(Note: this page states that pages that use HTTPS, such as apparently all of GitHub, are not able to be stored in the page cache. However, this was only true of WebKit, not Firefox's equivalent cache, and this was changed recently to bring the behavior in line: only if the page has Cache-Control: no-{store,cache} will the page be kept from the page cache.)<p><a href=""http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/107607"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/107607</a>",1335926953

3917402,comment,3914611,3915722,6,0,efsavage,,,"That variability is precisely why I'm freelancing, so I bill hourly, in quarter-hour increments no less.  I worked 13.25 hours yesterday, for 3 different clients, and I'm getting paid for all of them.  Last Friday I worked 6 hours, because I slept in a bit, and then it was nice out so I did some yard work.  I billed for 6.  Sunday I worked 4 hours for a client and 2 hours for my own projects, billed for 4.  I've billed as little as 15 hours in a full week (due to time spent on personal projects) and as many as 90.<p>If I billed daily, how can I justify that schedule?  I've worked with hourly freelancers before who said ""You're going to pay me for the whole day, and between 9 and 5 I'm all yours"", which is fair.  I don't make that commitment to my clients and I would not take a client who required it.  I commit to specific goals and bill them however long it takes.  I tell my clients my goal is to be as replaceable and fireable as possible, because I have plenty of other interesting work to do and I don't need to spend time doing crap work to pad a budget.<p>Do I run a timer or punch a clock?  No.  I look at the clock when I start, and when I end.  If I'm bouncing between two projects all morning, I just split the time.  I don't obsess over minutes spent on quick phone calls or responding to important emails or IMs.<p>I also don't want someone to ""use or lose it"", whether that's the last two hours of a slow day where I'm blocked, or a retainer agreement, because then they're going to ""use it"" on something dumb because it's now a sunk cost.<p>Perhaps I'm misleading myself, but I don't think this is because I'm low on the food chain, and it's certainly not bending to the wishes of an evil client as these are my own rules.  I think it's just a matter of work/lifestyle and I wouldn't have it any other way.",1335926662

For example, I don't have to worry about whether a new device that I've just bought will be compatible with all the media I already possess - since it's not DRM-encumbered, I'm free to do whatever neccessary to get the file onto the device.<p>Acquiring the media is the same - I can torrent music on my Linux PC, but I can't download music using many legitimate sources.<p>> You are part of the entitlement generation.

Every time a mew version of OSX shipped, competing third party apps would become unstable. Software compiled with non Apple tools would generate bogus error messages on pre-release copies of OSX. Apple would develop its own version of Java that ran faster but encouraged developers to use features not available in Java. They'd also bundle apps together so that anyone buying Apple's popular video editor, say, would have a free image editing and page layout programs. They'd steal code from third party developers and turn them into free add ons for their OSes. Oh and they'd simply kill off competitors by releasing free clones of their products.

They support dynamic recompilation at a higher optimization level, which we do not.<p>This is part of the debate in Google vs Oracle.   Google could have used HotSpot had they figured out some agreement, but instead ended up with Dalvik which lacks many of the advanced optimizations of HotSpot.<p>That said, java -server compared against out of the box Mono 2.10.8 is not an apple's to apple's comparison, it is by no means ""regular Java"".   That is Java tuned with some specific parameters.   It comes at the expense of interactive time, Mono's default is fast-JIT, and fast startup.<p>Java -server uses a fixed heap, this means that you must preallocate how much memory the application will use during its entire lifetime.   This is good for performance because the GC knows that it only has to scan for example memory between points A and B.   2 comparisons is all you need during GC to scan.    Meanwhile, Mono is uses a dynamic heap, which means that it can grow its memory usage based on demand (no need to fine tune the maximum heap every time your app crashes due to a low setting) and can return the released memory to the OS.   This complicates GC, because now we cant just compare against 2 values, we need to consider every object in the scope of a series of differently sized heaps.<p>With Mono 2.11, you can force your app to go fixed heap;   The only people that really have a use for this are HPC people and a handful of server people.   To be honest, most people dont want to configure the max heap of their server apps by crashing and trial and error.<p>The second component is that Mono's default is aimed for desktop/mobile configurations, not server loads.   If you want to use server loads, run Mono with the --llvm flag: you will have very slow startup times, but you will get code quality that is essentially the same code quality that you get from an optimizing C compiler nowadays.<p>As for Mono vs Dalvik memory use, in practice people run Mono with Dalvik (Mono for Android), not in standalone mode, so we end up paying for Dalvik's memory footprint.   But I agree, it would be nice to find out how much memory it actually uses.<p>Considering that we get the benefits of a more advanced GC, value types and generics while Java does not, it just seems like we would use less memory for comparable loads.",1335924406

The reason is what matters here, not the number rejected (as long as it wasn't a fluke, and since it was multiple devs I don't think it was).<p>They very much are being rejected for using dropbox.  You can be more specific and say it's for letting the user log in to dropbox but that's it.  Apple is blocking it because if you spend long enough wandering around the site from the login point you might find a place where you might be able to purchase something.<p>Logging in to dropbox is a core part of using dropbox and to suggest otherwise to call the title into question is very strange.",1335924262

3917284,comment,3916826,3917048,18,0,saurik,,,"The 30% ""apple tax"" on their App Store is not a major way that Apple makes money (more on this in paragraph 2). This leads to the conclusion that Apple is not attempting to hobble stores that undercut them: they simply like using their control of the store ecosystem to maintain the quality, simplicity, and consistency of the experience that allows them to provide to their customers, with the nice side effect of giving them massive leverage over their largest competitors and power over many external markets. I'd thereby reverse the order you have.<p>Checking the numbers, the profit margin on an iPhone is a little over $170, while the profit margin on an app is <<$1; most of the people I know who own an iPhone have purchased at least two of them (an upgrade a couple years later) and have purchased maybe, at most, 10 apps. If you check the Apple quarterly earnings reports Apple doesn't even bother separating App Store sales from iPod accessories: both are a tiny line item in comparison to the profit they make on their actual profit center (core hardware).<p>However, for content resources, such as books or music, the story is much different: I know people who have purchased many thousands of dollars of music, movies, and television shows from iTunes over the years. This is enough that the iPod and AppleTV can be effectively subsidized by iTunes (something you don't see Apple doing with the iPhone: they make certain to get their profit on that at the point of sale, possibly plus a carrier subsidy).<p>This is why this issue starts coming to the forefront for services like Rdio and Kindle: those actually hit Apple where it hurts, so Apple would prefer to use their control to hobble their opponents. But, Apple doesn't really want 30% of the revenue from these sales... it would be much better for Apple if they just went away, and people used iTunes instead. (I make this clear, as that is why I then don't feel it accurate to use this as an argument for the 30% being a primary concern.)",1335924103
