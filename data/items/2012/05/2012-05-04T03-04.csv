3926940,comment,3924657,3926572,1,0,sassafras,,,"It's true, I didn't read up on the tech at all.  That was just my initial reaction.  If it's fast, great!  I'd love to see some performance benchmarks.<p>As for Objective-C, whether the language in and of itself is the source of the slowness I was talking about is somewhat beside the point, IMHO.  I'm aware that laying out views in Cocoa involves a lot of overhead, and that it's as much to do with the complexity of what's going on under the hood as anything.  The fact of the matter remains though that you take a performance hit when laying out non-trivial views that need to be updated as fast as possible (e.g. when a table view scrolls by even one pixel and all the views have to be redrawn).  You could probably convince me that Objective-C isn't the reason this is the case, but in any event, when you find the need to drop down into direct drawing API calls in order to get the performance you need, the ""not much"" overhead you're talking about can become much more noticeable.  In a tight loop, a factor of 2 can make a huge difference, even though ""2x slower than C"" would be an enviable benchmark for many languages.<p>Again, I'm certainly not denigrating Ruby or other languages, but to me, that aspect of iOS development is a reminder that one needs to choose tools carefully for the job at hand.  Hence my hesitation at the announcement of alternative toolkits for iOS apps, the vast majority of which I have yet to see any stellar examples of.  Here's hoping this will break the mold.",1336103922

When one takes into consideration that the low-end, but current-generation iPhone and a new Android phone cost about the same it adds insult to injury.<p>I bought a Nexus One (this is an HTC phone, to be clear), and liked where things were going.  Just shy of two years later, support was dropped.  Then, my power button encountered a common fault, and I would have to mail the  thing in to fix it, paying some indeterminate amount of money (but probably around $50, I gather), as well as being out a phone for a couple of weeks.<p>It so happens I managed to acquire a Nexus S, but I would never have paid market rate, and the direction and velocity the both the built-in applications and the greater ecosystem has taken since then have left me with a very sour impression, even though there are features on Android that I very much like.<p>Basically, I can't justify paying more than $300 for a current-gen Android device, or roughly half that of an iPhone.  After all, in all but the most rare cases, your length of support from the manufacturer is less than half as long...<p>All told, I've been an Android user for three or four years  on the flagship devices starting with a G1, and since about a year ago I would have to say that my pessimism is basically monotonically increasing.",1336103357

I am not sure that downloading the root.zone.gz instead is necessarily required, especially with the amount of new tld's that they are planning on adding it would amount to a lot of wasted resources.<p>Also, for some domains (those in the UK are the ones that popped into my mind), you have sub-domains such as co.uk.<p>So that is another extra lookup... and depending on whether or not you want to use ANY or not in the lookup you find that if you query ns1.nic.uk for co.uk. (A) you get an SOA record back, but no NS results, so at that point instead of just being able to continue you'd have to retry with co.uk. (ANY). At that point you get back a truncated result, and need to retry over TCP...<p>Now you can continue on to ns1.nic.uk for co.uk. and ask it your question mydomain.co.uk. so and and so forth.<p>You've piqued my interest and I am thinking I may start keeping logs from my local recursive DNS resolver and start looking at what the cost is now versus what the cost would be if recursive DNS resolvers would go step by step themselves (keeping in mind TTL's and the like).",1336102103

My impression (not a lawyer, haven't done any significant research into the case beyond reading provided links, etc) was that the case was determined based on non-literal copying. If I see the source code for an application and then write my own application that doesn't share code, but does share the overall structure and makes the same design choices, there's an argument that I plagiarised the original software just as much as if I took a novel and rewrote the same story in my own words.<p>That doesn't seem to be true of an API. A program is the embodiment of an idea, ie an expression - the same program can usually be written in a myriad of ways. An API is a functional description of how to interact with that program - there's no way to reimplement that API without it looking identical. An API may require significant design, but design is usually protected by patent law rather than copyright law.<p>So really the case hinges on whether an API is an expression or merely an idea.
