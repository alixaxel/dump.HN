They do seem to make their source links pretty clear though (unlike Engadget; a pet peeve of mine) and the ratio of rehashed content vs. reviews/commentary/etc seems much higher.

The difference is that, reduce being eager, and these reducers fns being out of the seq game, there's no per-step allocation overhead, so it's faster. <i>Laziness is great when you need it, but when you don't you shouldn't have to pay for it.</i><p>Looking forward to trying this out. I've been implementing another language in Clojure (tho just experimenting for the moment). It's a non-lazy language (Groovy) so I have <i>reduce</i> all over the place, e.g.<p><pre><code>  (defn multiply [a b]
    (cond (and (number? a) (number? b)) (* a b)
          (and (vector? a) (integer? b)) (reduce conj [] (flatten (repeat b a)))
          (and (string? a) (integer? b)) (reduce str (repeat b a))))

  (defn findAll [coll clos]
    (reduce conj [] (filter clos coll)))
</code></pre>
Hope reducers give a speed boost by removing the laziness I'm not using.",1336535623

How many CEO's do you think have resumes that contain false data?<p>CEO's, older, experienced CEO's, only expose their resumes to a very limited scope of reviewers.  I'd suggest that the scrutiny (fact-checking) that their resume gets is not quite the same as, say, a developer applying to a large IT company. 
Whether the demand for a factually accurate resume from a potential CEO is greater, less than or the same as your average developer is left as a question for the reader.<p>Here the person leading the search embellished her own credentials.<p>Perhaps when selecting a CEO, there are ""more important things"" than the checking the accuracy of his/her resume.<p>But then you could also argue finding false information on a resume might just have some informative value of its own.<p>The public almost never gets to see a CEO's resume.

Most trading of these assets happens OTC, between private parties, and never touches an exchange.<p>I was not claiming that it does happen in an exchange. I was claiming that the banks were (successfully, for years) doing everything in their power to stop such an exchange from forming - do you think that is not true?<p>I was claiming that the big banks own the existing exchanges, currenex, hotspot, EBS, is that not true? (I've been out of the game in the last 3 years, the player names might have changed -- but I'd be surprised)<p>I have first hand experience of big banks exerting their influence on those (supposedly anonymous) exchanges to kick participants out when their trading style was not compatible with the banks' interest.<p>> This is far more de-centralized and efficient than having it happen on exchanges.<p>De-centralized, yes. Efficient? Only for the other party (which is a bank, the vast majority of the time).<p>If you want to change swiss francs to USD, and I want to change USD to swiss francs, if we had a two sided market (""an exchange"") to meet in, we'd find each other, agree on a public, easily discoverable price, and that's it; The one of of us who was smarter (or could wait longer) would earn the spread, the other one would pay it; alternatively we would meet at the mid price, splitting the spread. This happens all the time in exchange traded shares, commodities and futures.<p>However, the way it works today OTC is that instead you and I both find a big enough player (e.g. JP Morgan, or Goldman, or whoever), who makes a market in the currency - buys at the lower price, sells at the higher price, earning the entire spread, always. Unlike either of us, that player -- by virtue of its size and position -- knows the ""buy"" and ""sell"" orders of a lot of the smaller players, and can react accordingly.<p>> s someone who negotiated the rate at which he changed his Swiss francs into US Dollars at a JP Morgan Chase branch in New York, it isn't a regulatorily locked market. Having a private banking relationship will lower the threshold for negotiated rates, too<p>That's exactly my point: You would expect an exchange that would make this into a symmetric, competitive, information efficient market <i>because</i> there are hardly any regulatory issues (compared e.g. to running a stock or commodity exchange). The fact that this hasn't happened in 500 years of modern exchanges is a testament to the stronghold that banks have on currency trading.<p>Note that such exchanges have appeared for everything, from bandwidth to energy to pork bellies - but only in a very limited way for currencies (controlled by the same old boys network), where it is easiest to start such an exchange, and such a market benefits everyone except same old boys.",1336535220
