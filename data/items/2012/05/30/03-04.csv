4041299,comment,4036659,4037598,2,0,Suncho,,,"The usage of ""new"" in Java is consistent according to the rules of Java and the usage of ""new"" in C++ is consistent according to the rules in C++.  I don't think you can say that one is more consistent than the other.  To a C++ programmer, the usage of ""new"" in Java, on first blush, seems highly inconsistent.  Why use it for a String but not an int for example?  The answer, of course, is that Strings in Java are objects and ints aren't.  In C++, everything is an object.<p>""new"" simply has a different meaning in Java even though the syntax is similar.  If I were designing Java, I'd leave out the ""new"" keyword altogether.  I see it as unnecessary to the semantics and confusing to C++ programmers, but that's just me. =)<p>I agree that the post was a plea to language designers, but such a plea is probably pretty useless and I didn't find it worth discussing.

Often the constraints are money, time, resources.<p>So demands of a software project in the real world are very different than the academia. Although you can argue that Lisp is far more a better language than Perl, based on some parameters you wish to evaluate. Others might have totally different parameters, for example in terms of mere usability and pace of getting things done, Perl will fare better than Lisp.<p>While evaluating two technologies it is really important to define the parameters you wish to evaluate them upon. Without that we are just comparing Apples and Oranges and then arguing that nutrition on one isn't better than the other. Unless we define who needs an Apple and who needs an Orange for what reasons, we won't be able to say which is better than what for what purposes.<p>There fore comfort is really a subjective term. For a professor sitting in a university with endless time at his disposal Lisp will make the perfect and most comfortable language. But me sitting on P1 ticket assigned to me, and given 45 minutes to provide with solution has no other option but to use Perl.

4041223,comment,4040170,4040491,2,0,tikhonj,,,"I definitely agree about niches--in my experience, the best comment threads are not due to the forum but to the commenters. All other approaches weed out poorer comments; you can only get actively <i>good</i> comments by attracting the right sort of commenter. In practice, attracting competent people in a certain niche is easier, and most trolls aren't very interested in whatever particular topic you're discussing.<p>As far as your three categories go: the first two are really bad, but I'm also very put off by the last. Most places I've seen with a single ""dictator"" have the same problem: posts are moderated not only based on tone and presentation but also on content. I'm happy if a troll or overtly offensive comment gets removed, but seeing reasonable comments that may not follow the ""dictator's"" ideologies removed or ridiculed annoys me <i>more</i> than an inundation of poor comments, even if I <i>agree</i> with the ""dictator""! I stay away from most ""dictatorship"" style boards just as much as from the ""worthless holes"".<p>The best solutions outside of narrows niches are either truly impartial moderation (usually by people apathetic to the issues at hand) or some sort of process-oriented moderation based on voting or a set of clear guidelines. The former requires having the right sort of people run the site while the other requires having a reasonable audience amenable to moderating themselves. Neither is a silver bullet, but both are much better than the three alternatives you listed.<p>Coincidentally, I still think the best moderation system I've seen was on Slashdot. I don't go there very often any more, but the highly rated posts were <i>always</i> good. If anything, it went too far the other way--too many good posts got buried. However, even with that misgiving, the end effect was still basically the best I've seen. Also, classifying posts into categories like ""insightful"" or ""funny"" also really helped especially for skimming through longer threads.<p>EDIT: Also: I think having very simple rules for moderation is the best approach. The best rule I saw was simple: ""no personal attacks"".<p>This is trivial to enforce fairly (that is, both removing bad posts and <i>not</i> removing good posts) and manages to get rid of most ""bad"" comments without stifling minority opinions. It also keeps the discussion much more civil and pertinent, which is very nice.

4041183,comment,4039314,4040536,6,0,hysan,,,"The real answer, which is alluded to in your post, is that the years requirement is simply a mechanism to reduce risk and blame for the person hiring you. There are a few things to consider in these situations:<p>1. He is already being interviewed despite satisfying the years experience requirement. This means they are willing to ignore that requirement. (or I misread this and he never made it to an interview)<p>2. All new hires have a ramp up period. This costs money and a failed hire can be costly.<p>3. A hiring manager (or whoever has the final say) is the person who will ultimately take the blame for any failed hire.<p>Considering the above, there is really only one question that needs to be satisfied in the mind of the employer for any ""inexperienced"" candidate to get a job:<p>- Is the risk of hiring this person lower than that of all other candidates?<p>When you try to answer that question, you get a clear understanding of where the years requirement fits in and how it effects the go/no go decision. So let's see what risk factors are normally vetted out during interviews:<p>1. Skills - Can he do the job? (the well roundedness part of the answer falls here) Let's make the assumption that he can so the answer is yes.<p>2. Personality - Does he fit in with the team? (conflict resolution and all that other stuff in the SO post falls into here) Let's make another assumption that he can so the answer is yes.<p>3. Will he flake out? - This is where experience factors in heavily. Evaluating someone with very little work history makes this impossibly hard to get correct. With longer resumes, it is easier to have high confidence in making this judgement. 3 years is generally enough time to see if the candidate either stayed with one company for a long time or stayed at 2 companies for a long time. This is usually a good indicator that the candidate worked out well and can be trusted to contribute in the long run. This is also why jumping too many jobs in a short period of time (or over a career) is generally considered a bad thing. It makes you a very high risk hire.<p>When you are asked personal questions (where do you see yourself in 5 years, what do you do in your free time, etc), this is where you are given a chance to alleviate their concerns. Questions about prior work experience are also used to vet out a candidate's flakiness. Even someone with tons of experience can fail this part of the interview in which case they would also get rejected. Low experience candidates are simply starting with a -10 buff.<p>So to answer the OP's questions:<p>1. How can I overcome the assumption that I do not have the skills required because I do not have the ""right"" number of years of experience?<p>He must minimize the ""Will he flake out factor?"" Either ace the ""flake out"" part of the interview OR show yourself to be so outstanding with regards to skills and/or personality that they ignore your potential flakiness. The best way to do this is via skills. You can't be just better than your peers. You must be better than your seniors. Either show this through outside work (personal projects, open source contributions, etc.) or by impressing them with your knowledge. Based on what the OP wrote, he seems capable but doesn't STAND OUT stand out. The personality route is also viable but that is much harder to swing unless you know people in the company already.<p>In the case he didn't even make it to an interview, then he must rely solely on displaying his skills via his resume. Outside projects and open source contributions with a personal website (or a link to code repos) is the best way to accomplish this. If his resume looks generic, then it's no wonder he didn't make it to an interview.<p>2. Are skills directly proportional to years of experience?<p>No. I know some people who have been programming since they were 10. Coming out of college, they clearly have outstanding skills but zero experience. But as stated above, this is not the real reason why he was rejected (he should actually ask for feedback assuming he made it to an interview round).",1338347303

4041174,comment,4039784,4039784,2,0,trustfundbaby,,,"I was so upset when I got to work this morning and found that not only had the chrome extension changed, the website had changed completely too.<p>It used to be that I'd click on the chrome extension icon and immediately get a link along with the page title that I could post straight to twitter or facebook. The j.mp/bit.ly homepage was bookmarked in my bookmarks bar and showed me everything I cared about in one place (the link, with another link to copy it, how many clicks on my link, and how many total clicks to that particular article).<p>I imagine they went ""hang on, we're making life waaaay too easy for them"" and proceeded to throw up the vomit that is the current homepage. Now to get the shortened link from the extension, I have to click save and them do some other nonsense to retrieve my link.<p>I'm the worst kind of angry about this ... angry and powerless, because bit.ly is such a part of my online life now (personally and a bunch of apps that I've written use it) that I simply can't do without it ... there's no other decent alternatives, plus I have this weird thing where I think its kind of rude to complain about a free service.<p>So apart from this, I'm just going to shut up and hope something better comes along so I can jump ship. It happened with delicious (pinboard), so hopefully, it won't be long.",1338347021

4041170,comment,4040863,4040863,-4,0,matznerd,,,"I thought this was pretty standard so here are some other tips for anyone starting a new site or looking to increase their SEO. Sitemaps and metatags are the main things you need on every site+page. I suggest you then write a 600-1000 word article using your keyword as the title and in the URL. Then use the same keyword 1-2% of the time in the body, so a 1000 word article has 10 mentions. Plus use the keyword in an H1, H2, and H3 tag. Also use the keyword in one link to another page on your site. You also want to include at least one off page link with anchor text of your keyword to a high-authority site like wikipedia. And then after that is done, I suggest you ping it using something like www.pingomatic.com to make it get crawled more quickly. Any other q's feel free to msg or email me.",1338346909
