This allows them to perform more high-level language-specific optimizations. LLVM forces front-ends to lower their code directly down to its fairly low level IR, thus throwing away some of this high-level information. It's possible to use LLVM's metadata system to preserve some of it, but this is subject to a variety of restrictions, and decorating a low-level IR with high-level decorations can be substantially less convenient than just using a higher-level IR. Clearly there are interesting tradeoffs here.<p>For another example, the author ribs Perl, Python, Ruby, and Java for not sharing backend code, and yet, years later, LLVM has still not been proven broadly viable for such languages, despite numerous efforts. Maybe someday it will be, but it's pretty clear that there are, yes, tradeoffs in play.

So it looks like so:<p>Version A - 200 / 500 - 40%\nVersion B - 150 / 500 - 30%<p>A new affiliate comes on board and decides to send 200 visitors to your page from some ""Buy 200 visitors for $1"" domain redirection service. These visitors are such low quality that they will never ever buy anything and will probably just close the window immediately (or are bots). Now your results look something like this:<p>Version A - 200 / 680 - 29.4%\nVersion B - 150 / 520 - 28.8%<p>And with just 200 visitors some random affiliate has killed all your results. Now you could add filtering and reports based on the affiliate or traffic source but this is more code and more attention you have to pay to the test.<p>If you were running a traditional A/B test your results would look like this:<p>Version A - 200 / 600 - 33%\nVersion B - 150 / 600 - 25%<p>And even though the overall conversion rate is lower you can still see version A is better than B.<p>The idea is good and I love the idea of auto optimization, but it does have it's flaws which require more than 20 lines of code to overcome.",1338351529
