I have doubts to the quality of screens they will choose, for cost's sake. This is a country that still has a lot of poor people and doesn't have the tax base to use iPads exactly. Is a poor screen better than a ""Retina Display"" paper book? Now, while displays will be cheaper and better by the end of the 5 year rollout, and (barring more Europe recession) Turkey is still growing at a respectable rate, giving them a better tax base in 2018. I'm still not convinced what they can reasonably afford.<p>2. If these tablets are too good or can do too much, they will be stolen. Kids will drop them. Dropping a paper book isn't as problematic as dropping every book you have and the tablet shattering, or a kid stealing another's tablet/submerging it in water out of spite, or adults stealing the tablet. It will happen.",1337327991

3990822,comment,3989454,3989454,7,0,pinaceae,,,"For you guys wondering how it is even possible to fire 30k people at once:<p>In every organization of that size there is cruft. Mind-bogglingly large cruft. Working with those behemots will teach you that you could fire entire departments and no one would notice. There is so many people simply tasked with completely non-customer relevant things like reviewing HR review forms, etc. - they get their pay, produce no tangible value.<p>Now mind you, every company needs people to keep the whole structure going. HR, IT are never profitable, of course. But at some point during the growth phase of a company these start to metastasize  - they are cancer, feeding themselves, leeching of the company that hosts them. And not just money, but also power. Suddenly managers of those areas have a say in company direction. Block innovation because of 'processes'. Have never seen a customer, never produced anything in their life, have no shred of idea of the core business of their company.<p>And just like cancer treatment, past a certain stage you need to cut deep and wide.<p>Prahalad and Hamel laid a bit of groundwork for more effective org-cancer treatment with their core competency definition.<p>You know your cuts were deep enough when a few months in you notice pain. People not being able to service customers effectively. And you'd be surprised just when this really happens at places like HP. 9% is laughable. If you have lots of layers in an organization, every employee laid off has a ripple effect. Need less HR, accounting, IT, etc to service less employees. Even less layers of management as you can combine teams.<p>Looking at certain country hubs of HP here in Europe I'd wager you could easily cut 50% of the current workforce without any negative impact on customer relations.",1337327950

All the newspapers Berkshire Hathway is buying are modestly profitable according to Poynter Institute. They didn't buy the Tampa Tribune newspaper which is struggling.<p>2. Berkshire is also loaning $400 million to Media General at 10.5% interest. And providing a $45 million credit line.  The interest on that loan will go a long way towards paying for the newspapers.<p>3. And on top of this, Berkshire is getting stock warrants equivalent to almost 20% of Media General. Media Generals stock prices are already up by 33%.<p>In essence, Berkshire has put in $600 million which will earn them about $60-80 million per year (from newspaper revenue and interest on the loan.) Gives them 20% of a media company with a market cap of $90 million and room to rise higher. And leaves with a $400 million loan which has to be paid back to them eventually.<p>This is a bloody genius deal.",1337327764

For example, the kids who have received these tablets have been selling them on the street to buy candy instead of using them to study. Further, there is no centralized management software for the books and other tablet content. As a result, kids just delete books on the tablets and tell their teachers that tablets don't work because they are missing books. The data center that the gov't has been using is not equiped to deal with the volume of service requests that the tablets are sending to the DC. There is a real sense amongst participants that despite all the investment on part of the Turkish government the project will be a huge failure.",1337327700

3990789,comment,3988515,3989934,2,0,nhaehnle,,,"<i>This activity is ultimately underwritten by deposits.</i><p>Yes and no. First of all, deposits are created whenever a bank gives out a loan. So it is not the deposit that makes loan creation possible, but rather the reverse: creation of loans is where money in deposits comes from in the first place. Without loans there would be no deposits.<p>Now the outstanding loans given by the bank are on the asset side of its balance sheet and there must be something corresponding on the liabilities side. For most banks, deposits are indeed a large part of liabilities.<p>However, the liability may just be a loan from the central bank or from other banks instead. It's not strictly necessary for banks to have deposits at all (and there are banks which specialize in such a way).<p>The only reason why it makes sense for banks to attract deposits is that they typically pay less interest on those deposits than they would have to pay for other refinancing options.<p>And again, all this doesn't say anything about the dynamics of the system, i.e. it doesn't say anything about loan creation. It's not like there is some process where the banks say ""Look, we have X more deposits than loans, so let's give out some more loans"". Some banks operate with more deposits than loans, others operate with less. In the end, they give loans whenever they find a creditworthy borrower.<p>In the overall system, i.e. when summing over all banks, the sum of loans is roughly the same as the sum of deposits, because loans are where deposits come from in the first place. (I say roughly because owners of deposits can transform them into other types of assets such as bonds.)",1337326910
