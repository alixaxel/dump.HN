It's still a LOT less than the actual impact of your departure on the business.<p>Counter offers never work out in the long term.  Now that you've put in your notice, you're no longer seen as loyal.  Therefore, had you accepted (bad idea) they would not have kept you around any longer than absolutely necessary.<p>Even so, trashing your former employer after they offer you more money, however self-serving, is bad business.<p>I would not hire somebody if I saw them bad mouthing a former employer.

3990126,comment,3988881,3989728,9,0,InclinedPlane,,,"P/E is a crude tool sometimes, and it's important to know it's limits of utility. Amazon, for example, has more than 10x the revenue of Facebook and has been undertaking a great deal of expansion, hiring, and investment in recent years, which has kept it's earnings relatively depressed. More so, the future growth potential of Amazon is very straightforward. They will almost assuredly garner a larger portion of the retail goods market over the coming years, especially throughout Europe, Asia, and South America where they have only recently started making inroads. More so, their digital goods businesses (eBooks, MP3s, video on demand, PaaS hosting, etc.) are on track for a hefty amount of growth as well. More so, Amazon is an enormously diversified business. Betting that Amazon will continue to execute well in enough areas to continue to expand immensely and to bring in enough profit to warrant today's seemingly inflated P/E ratios is not actually that crazy of a bet. Amazon's market cap is only around $100 billion total, which is barely twice Amazon's annual revenue.<p>Now, compare that to Facebook where they <i>already</i> have more than 10% the population of the entire Earth as users and yet have less than $4 billion in annual revenues and yet are slated to IPO with the same market cap as Amazon. In order for that bet to make sense Facebook would need to grow its business by one or two orders of magnitude and dramatically change their profitability structure. In short, they would need to fundamentally transform their business. That's the bet that people are making when they buy facebook at a 110 P/E ratio and to me that seems a lot riskier than the Amazon bet.",1337307962

Put another way, taking money from A and giving it to B so B can buy things from A does not (and cannot) make A wealthier.<p>Sure they can, according to some models.<p>Here's the argument: Say A and B produce goods for each other, and so A might buy something from B for $5, and B might come back and buy something from A with the same $5. They are happily creating value, trading back and forth. Now, say something scares A so that he wants to save some of his money instead of spend. Then B is getting less income from A, and so she also becomes worried about her future income and spends less. Then A gets even less money, and is even less willing to spend. As you can see there is a feedback cycle where A and B produce (and spend) less and less. This is a recession.<p>Now give B some money, possibly even taken from A. Now B is getting a more reliable income, an is more willing to spend on A, who thus earns more and becomes more willing to spend on B, and so on in positive feedback.<p>This is basically Krugman's ""Babysitting Co-op"" scenario.",1337307493
