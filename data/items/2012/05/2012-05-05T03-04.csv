The judge spoon feeds them the law and the experts spoon feed them the technical information. And of course the judge retains substantial discretion to set aside the conclusions of the jury. The stuff about ""theatrical performance"" is more TV than reality. It's very important as a lawyer to be able to explain complicated concepts to the jury in a way they understand, but that's clarity not theatrics.<p>The jury is mostly there to weigh the credibility of the witnesses and experts. E.g. do we believe this Google witness when he says he didn't know about X? We do this for a very sensible reason, which is that it makes the legal system credible. It's very easy to lose faith in the judicial system because you don't trust judges, etc. It's easier to put your faith in a jury of your peers. And at the end of the day, as a dispute resolution mechanism that's what the judicial system depends on: faith that it will render fair judgments.",1336188262

The total download numbers for all ten apps is about 17,000 (1500 Android), with about 500k impressions for the last 7 months.  At best, when the apps were most popular, I was making $35 a day in ad revenue which has settled down to about $5.<p>However, I must note that the apps are not very good. As I was new to C#, each app took less time than the last, but the first took about 3 months of my free time. It was a cool way to learn to code while giving myself a tiny boost in income.

It's healthier for my mental sanity to recognize that great things can still be done by those not at the top than to try and suppose the top is nearer to me than I would like or suppose that the top doesn't exist. If you asked me who I thought was at the top of humans thus far, I'd respond with von Neumann.

They collaborated on problems of Taylor instabilities and they wrote a report. When Fermi went back to Chicago after that work he called in his very close collaborator, namely Herbert Anderson, a young Ph.D. student at Columbia, a collaboration that began from Fermi's very first days at Columbia and lasted up until the very last moment. Herb was an experimental physicist. (If you want to know about Fermi in great detail, you would do well to interview Herbert Anderson.) But, at any rate, when Fermi got back he called in Herb Anderson to his office and he said, ""You know, Herb, how much faster I am in thinking than you are. That is how much faster von Neumann is compared to me.""</i><p>And there was this piercing comment made here a while back: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1054201"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1054201</a> An excerpt:<p><i>Look, I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you, but if you have difficulty with any programming concept, you must not be a supergenius. You're just an ordinary genius at best.</i><p><i>The sad truth is that there are some people for whom programming comes as naturally as thinking, with code formed as easily as thoughts; and if it takes an effort to understand any aspect of programming, you have just learned that you are not one of those people.
