(A cursory search turned up .net magazine declaring it the #1 web design trend for 2012.) Skipping it for an experimental prototype is probably fine, but it's essential for serious work.<p>Third, as I mentioned from the start, the site in question here fails even when browsing with almost all scripts enabled: something essential in its design gets caught even by NoScript's minimal anti-XSS protection. That suggests an actual security risk to me.<p>And finally, I won't get into an argument about security bugs, but you haven't commented on the privacy issue at all. In its default mode NoScript prevents the vast majority of tracking systems that I've seen, while having a minor and entirely manageable impact on day to day browsing once you've used it for a week or so. You may not like that tradeoff, but it would be nice if you'd give some minimal level of respect to those who do.",1336186648

I'm certainly not saying it doesn't play a part, but it's still a hotly debated question among experts as to what is ultimately responsible for the crime drop. Most likely, it's due to a combination of factors, for the basic reason that social phenomena like crime tend to be very complicated. We would be extraordinarily lucky if it could be pinned down a single, simple explanation.<p>And while the socioeconomic distribution of the population would be expected to play a part (which is certainly affected by family planning), it would be highly unlikely for progress in policing techniques not to play a part at all.",1336186207

In general the speakers want to network with anyone interesting/useful, speaker or not.<p>Two recommendations:<p>1) If you enjoy or don't enjoy a presentation please give concrete feedback. Either in person or via a conference feedback mechanism. It <i>really</i> helps to know what's working and what needs further improvement. And it's a good first point of contact for networking.<p>2) Apply to become a speaker! Start from somewhere small (or not) and go from there. It's too easy to convince yourself you've got nothing people want to hear. A few years I started with speaking at a local evening event in a town in New Zealand--this year I'll be speaking and running an extremely well received workshop at OSCON for the third year in a row.<p>* Blatant plug:<p>If you <i>are</i> going to be at OSCON (the O'Reilly Open Source Convention in Portland, Oregon) in July and want to learn how to get started with the Arduino consider attending my ""Get Started with the Arduino - A Hands-On Introductory Workshop"" <a href=""http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/23941"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oscon.com/oscon2012/public/schedule/detail/23941</a>.
