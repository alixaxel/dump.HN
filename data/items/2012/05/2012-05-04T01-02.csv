I am not in front of a bloomberg terminal, but off hand I believe Google doubled its quarterly revenue in 1 year.  Something like $800M-> $1.5B and added just 2000 employees[1].

Secondly, and more importantly, the electoral majorities commonly want their government to pursue policies that are in opposition to each other.  That is, they want both more services and lower taxes.  Ask people if they want free health care and you'll get a sizable majority.  But so what?  Saying you want something isn't the same thing as saying you're willing to pay for it.<p>Corporations are no different.  Shareholders want higher returns and less risk.

(this is an overly simplistic definition, but it is mostly right, almost all the time).<p>So you have:
Gross Revenue - Expenses = Earnings<p>What is left out of this simple definition is ""operating leverage"".  Operating leverage is the concept that you have a set of costs that don't move much no matter how much your revenue moves.  Most internet companies have a lot of operating leverage.<p>So lets take a hypothetical company:<p>Quarter 1: (Revenue) $100m - (Expenses) $99M = (Earnings) $1M ..... All with a market cap of $100m, the P/E would be 100.<p>Now, if expenses are mostly fixed, (think lots of engineers salaries which have most everything running in macros etc.) and the revenue increases by 5% what is the new PE?<p>Q2
$105m - $99m = $6m .... all with a market cap of $100m, the new P/E would be about market average of 16.66<p>--You could do the same example if you drop your long term projections on R&D, or acquisitions or any number of expenses.",1336096150

Don't take on financial obligations that will make it impossible for you to return to school.

It's hard to live in a dorm after you've lived like an adult for a while.<p>2. It's easier to jump into another job than it is to go back to school.  After all, you were making good money, right? And isn't the point of school to get a good job?  This is dangerous thinking.

Since then, I've looked back at what I had, and realised that the format would be really well-suited to Android/iOS (more so the former since the code is already in Java).<p>The code is 95% done (there were a few levels which weren't fully implemented, IIRC), but the game itself is pretty small-scale compared to something like Pokmon, and everything aside from the code is more or less complete.<p>So, here's what I'll contribute to the project:<p>* I'll help with the coding and related work, of course, though it will be more of a side thing for me<p>* I have a private Git server we can use<p>* The original Java Swing code, including a custom game engine, characters, levels, maps, etc.<p>* Extremely extensive documentation (this may very well be more useful than the original code for some parts of the game, actually); includes all level specifications, event flow, all dialogue, etc.<p>* Related video, images, and audio<p>If anyone cares to see it, this is the intro video I have embedded in the start of the game: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i4i9sz44-k (depending on how professionally the redux wants to take itself, I may be willing to put in some money after the MVP release to remake this and/or properly licence ""borrowed"" IP).<p>Regarding funding, if someone does decide to take on this project, we can set up a Kickstarter page, but if that doesn't pan out I suppose we'll have to bootstrap it and keep the first release alpha-quality. Regarding revenue, the obvious options that come to mind are advertising, flat cost, and/or possible in-game purchases.<p>---<p>So, is anyone interested in working on this?

Not only would it allow for better ""traditional"" editors, the fact that iOS doesn't rely on the keyboard for OS-level navigation would make it a perfect vehicle for VNC and RDP clients with ""transparent"" keyboard support.<p>I could understand Apple prohibiting the use of such an API for accelerators ""merely"" to discourage half-assed ports of traditional WIMP apps, but why not allow the use of a physical keyboard as an ""IT controller"" just as they permit external controllers for games? It's simply unreasonable to insist that developers build a more ""touch-based"" interface to fundamentally non-touch-based remote systems, and nearly as unreasonable to expect professional programmersto adapt to a ""touch-based"" UI paradigm for _editing text_.

(based upon trial and error, previous experience, etc.)<p>- Consistency: how much is it like other patterns in the same UI/environment?<p>- Metaphor: how much does it 'feel' like other real-world objects and leverages how the user understands them already?<p>These are of course a sample of high level overlapping themes. This particular prototype is obviously optimizing for efficiency. It does so very well, but at a very, very deep cost to the others. It is an undiscoverable interface. It utterly destroys the direct manipulation illusion of the iPad. It causes the virtual keys to no longer be metaphorical buttons since you can drag across them for an effect. It is inconsistent with other use of gestures, particularly since you are controlling a cursor <i>remotely</i> much like you would with a mouse (likely a fire-able proposition at Apple!)<p>The thing that makes Apple's work so amazing is the balance they manage to strike between these things and so consistently get it right.
