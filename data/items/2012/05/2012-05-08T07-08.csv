Rasa dari xamthone sendiri sangat enak dan tidak seperti obat rasanya bahkan seperti jus, manis, asam, segar, dan hanya ada rasa sedikit kesat dari kulit manggis. Rasa dari obat herbal xamthone plus yang tidak seperti obat tadi lah yang membuat xamthone plus sering di sebut jus, tepatnya jus kulit manggis.<p>Obat herbal xamthone plus dibuat dengan bahan utama dari buah manggis terutama bagian daging kulit (bukan bagian kulit luar tentunya). Selain dari bahan utama kulit manggis obat herbal xamthone plus juga dicampur dengan bahan pendukung lain seperti bunga rosela, apel, anggur, dan madu murni.

""I've seen {0} {1} {2}"".format(""John"", ""eat"", ""an apple"")

Just because of the homepage, I'm not inclined to continue using the app. I know you guys aren't designers but there are a few improvements that I can see.<p>1) Your tagline on the bottom of the homepage tells me more about your service than the copy with the ""Have the best vacations humanly possible"". Lists are boring, especially without visuals. Because the homepage is the most important page, I'd focus on only getting them to try search first then find out about all the other features you offer.<p>2) As many have mentioned, the video thing is really annoying. I click on the video to expect something to watch, but it's blank. If you don't have a video, don't put a placeholder image there yet.<p>3) Where do you want to go and when? default text in the searchbar. The less the user needs to type, the better. It's also MUCH more convenient for the user to select the When from a drop down list because they usually have pretty precise dates they want to travel. Because there's this extra option, I didn't know what to type at first. I had to search 3 times to realize that you do City, State and Country.<p>4) Because your site doesn't have any visuals, your featured lists actually take most of my attention. Those should never take away from your search bar which is your call to action.<p>I'm no expert on design, but I'm just listing out what I've learned the past year (my homepage for a past startup was very similar to what you have now).<p>I took a few minutes to make you a sample homepage mockup that incorporates a lot of the stuff I mentioned above. Design is a really subjective matter; everyone will think differently of the mockup below, so it's up to you.

For one thing, it conflates Fund of Funds with other hedge funds, which is pretty questionable given that they're really a separate class with different fee and performance expectations.<p>DeutscheBank is a bunch of kids and that particular report is questionable??? I hope <i>you</i> don't work in funds management.<p>> Effectively, SEC regulations like Dodd-Frank impact large funds worldwide, because you're subject to them if you have more than a small number of US investors.

A hedge fund is <i>defined</i> by the class of investor it aims at (institutional and/or qualified investors) - everything else is variable - hedge funds are diverse in almost all other dimensions (although some things are common e.g. 2 and 20).<p>Returning back to the original point:<p>""You could swap out VC funds with hedge funds and the article would pretty much be the same.""<p>Very true. The variation within the hedge fund industry is more than the variation between a VC fund and any average hedge fund. IMHO 90% of the article applies to hedge fund investors. The issues of the 2% management fee, the human factors of the fund managers, and the issues to do with transparency (black box) are all relevant to many hedge funds.<p>The only reason I am answering you is because I hate seeing the standard misconceptions about hedge funds being promulgated.",1336462944

The 0.3% you are being offered could be 0.2% or less by the time of exit.  0.2% of a $100 million acquisition is $200k.  If your startup does not hit about a billion dollar valuation <i>and then exit at that valuation</i> you don't get a motivational amount of upside out of the equity.<p>Additionally, there are a variety of ways where an exit can happen but your 0.2% ends up evaluating to 0%.  One is liquidation preferences.  (e.g. Let's say that your company takes $20 million of investment at a 2x liquidation preference, then you exit for $40 million, which your friend thinks you break even at.  You will receive a check for $0.  Your four founder friends may simultaneously receive checks from a side-pot, because they actually matter to getting the deal done.)<p>Then there's just the numerically most common outcome, under which your startup never successfully exits and you took a pay-cut to work overly hard for a few years with no upside but a resume strongly suggesting to your next employer that you enjoy overwork and underpay.<p>You're an intermediate engineer, at minimum.  Salaries in the Valley for people in your bracket are creeping to $140k+ <i>plus</i> (smaller amounts of) equity.  Seriously.  They're DYING for people right now.  Salaries for engineers in other big metropolitan areas, including Seattle, are going up as well.  I guarantee you that you can find offers substantially more compelling in Seattle if you love living there.  (Including remoting arrangements.)",1336462133

3942626,comment,3942081,3942081,4,0,strlen,,,"Hi, here are a few bits of advice based on your current and previous posts.<p>First, please make sure to proof read your posts and find a few folks who are willing to help you do so: ability to write well counts a great deal (<i>especially</i> if you're serious about running a business). Good news is that you already enjoy writing and thus you are far more likely to invest in deliberate practice.<p>Second, I think you drew the wrong conclusions in your previous post. Big companies are rather predictable: you have (with some margin of error) a fairly good idea of what the culture, environment, et al are going to be like when you decide to join one. Startups, on the other hand, vary greatly from one to another: you're more likely to have a horrible experience, but you're also more likely to have an amazing experience. You've had an unpleasant experience at one startup, but it doesn't logically follow that your only option is to start your own company: there are plenty of companies that are actually great to work for.<p>To be honest, I don't think this is the right time for you to do a startup: looking at your previous posts and comments on this site, it sounds like you need to build your technical skill-set (looks like the last company you've worked for didn't even use source control!), confidence, and a network of like minded people. If somebody asks you ""why would I want to move to Silicon Valley to start a company if I already have a great job?"", they have a very different set of values from somebody you'd want as a founder. Great engineers (or product managers, designers, and so on) always have many options available to them <i>besides</i> starting their own company: it's a matter of choice and not a last resort.<p>Spend some time improving your online presence: at the least fix the gramatical errors (e.g., its/it's and build/built), build a few web or mobile applications (assuming that's what you're interested in), put up a few projects on GitHub/Bitbucket (but have a few strong programmers review them before making the repositories public). This will make it easier for you to show people (potential co-founders, clients, customers, employers, coworkers, or just like-like minded folks) that you're serious and have potential.<p>Essentially I feel you're running <i>from</i> something (in this case a job you didn't enjoy and the experience of being laid off). Instead, put yourself into a situation where a startup is something you run <i>to</i>.<p>[Edit: corrected a few grammatical errors of my own]",1336461536
