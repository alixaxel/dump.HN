I have already moved to another country, not because life cost was cheap, but because it was less stressful for me.<p>I am passionate about my work but I mostly focus that passion on side projects and hobby (that is for free). Not saying that mixing work and passion is bad ( I think, it is great ), but that can easily be abused ( game industry, animation industry ).<p>I think it is wrong to push people from the start to work on weekends (that was the way I read it), it is the fastest way to burn them out (speak of personal experience here, first company (start-up) I joined payed me ~900$ a month but I didn't care because I was motivated, worked 10am-8pm~1am including some weekends, after 5-6 years of this I was a mess, Apple is hopefully not be the same ).",1336442258

The problem is that the source of support for that insurgency was in North Vietnam, and it was impossible for US ground troops to advance there and eliminate that support.<p>The war effort was also politically micromanaged--for instance, every airstrike had to be individually approved by the White House. This led to delays and, frankly, interference in military affairs from incompetent politicians.<p>Fighting a counterinsurgent war on the defensive is never strategically sound; one is always better served by being on the move and taking the initiative. This was politically impossible in Vietnam, which is why it took so long.<p>Now, perhaps there were valid political reasons not to invade north Vietnam. In that case, the answer is not to get involved at all. You either do the job right or you don't do it at all. In either case, the mistake <i>wasn't</i> that the US invaded Vietnam without a good reason--there was no invasion, and there was a good reason.

While there's some cool stuff involving wavelets and using interesting basis sets (matching pursuit looks cool), if you're primarily looking at power and frequency over time, the FFT is sufficient, and usually faster than the other algorithms. (And if you're looking at power/phase, the common Morlet wavelet choice is mathematically equivalent to an FT with a Gaussian taper.)<p>I'm not sure what you mean by ""on a small window such that this isn't really applicable""; can you give an example? As long as you accept the inherent time-frequency resolution trade-offs, there's no obstacle to using FFT on a small window. It's called the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), and it's used everywhere; it's probably used more than analyzing an entire signal, since we frequently want to know how power and phase change over time in a signal, and a full-signal FT can't tell you that.",1336441601

Bias is nothing more than <i>the extent to which your opinion differs from reality</i>. If you consistently and vehemently insist that the earth is round and not flat, you aren't biased, you're <i>right</i>.<p>And regardless of bias, you have to also take into account the specific evidence and reasoning provided with an assertion.
