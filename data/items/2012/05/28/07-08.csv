Orson Scott Card's stories are the opposite: Plot drives everything, and simplistic prose carries you through. They're both valid types of fiction, but make for totally different experiences.<p>When you put down a Card novel, you remember the story arc. When you put down a Gibson novel, you remember the images. Everyone knows the opening line of Neuromancer, but few people quote lines from Ender's Game. Everyone remembers the ending of Ender's Game, but many people forget the ending of Neuromancer, even if they enjoyed it.",1338191947

I recommend 10-15 mins of steady pace on treadmill for your warmup, some stretching afterwards. Running will control your fat growth and cardio in general will increase your stamina and overall good feel. 30-50s breaks between repetitions - stay in the zone, don't let the muscles to cool down and don't waste time chatting with training buddies.<p>* Start with small weights, lots of newbies feel ashamed to put too little weight but nobody really cares. Too much weight will damage you at worst, slow your progress at best.<p>* The only supplements you should buy are whey protein, creatine and vitamins - that's all you need and that's all that worked for me or my friends, everything else is money wasting.<p>Keep on doing that and you will see results after 2-3 months, then results itself will be enough to motivate you not to quit.",1338190137
