There have got to be a few clever / simple ways of discouraging low-quality hate, without discouraging high-quality hate or moving in the direction of censoring or complexity.  By ""low-quality"" I mostly mean the derogatory and/or superficial ones.<p>Just throwing some out there...  Ask people to voluntarily check a ""this is negative"" checkbox when submitting, and if they have too many of them show a ""curmudgeon"" badge next to their name.  Or, let the poster have a limit number of ""this is infair"" or ""disputed"" points they can assign, that will mitigate the benefit to someone's karma, or ding/label the person if too many people accuse them of being unfair in proportion to their number of comments.<p>I know, I know, these ideas are stupid, and dumb, and idiotic, and so am I for having had them, and so is anyone within a 10 foot radius of me at the time I posted this, by proxy.

Forgot I might be talking to a robot and I must have a repeatable scientific experiment to validate my individual experience.  Otherwise it means nothing.<p>Oh, except those rules for a scientifically valid and repeatable study don't count when he cites it himself:<p>""<i>The evidence for an inborn, male predisposition for systematizing comes from a single experiment on newborn infants, tested with a single person and object. The person was the report's first author, who surely knew the experimental hypotheses and who, we now learn, may have known the sex of the infants whose attention she elicited. The experiment provides no evidence that the basis of infants' preference, if real, had anything to do with the categorical distinction between the displays. Would infants show the same preferences for other face/object pairs? Would they maintain this preference if low-level properties of the two displays, such as their speed of motion, were equated? One need not object to Baron-Cohen's politics to be less than persuaded by his data.</i>""[1]  says Elizabeth Spelke[2].<p>Sad Trombone.<p>Go validate your sexist culture another way.  Evopsych:Psychology::Astrology:Astronomy<p>And yes, I watched that entire clip.  It sucked and wasn't worth the time.  It's by a comedian who gets scientists with competing models react to each other's statements.  And only the newborn baby one has any bearing on gender vs environment when it comes to women avoiding CS.<p>I'll include another excerpt below because it's just too good to leave out:<p><i>""\nMore important, Baron-Cohen fails to consider the extensive evidence that has accumulated, over the last thirty years, on infants' developing understanding of object mechanics. Hundreds of well-controlled experiments reveal no male advantage for perceiving objects or learning about mechanical systems. In most studies, male and female infants are found to discover the same things at the same times. Both males and females come to see the complete shapes of partly hidden objects under the same conditions and at the same ages. They figure out how objects support one another, through the same series of steps. They reach for objects by extrapolating their motions, with equal accuracy. They make the same errors when they search for hidden objects, and they get over those errors at the same time. Sometimes female infants have an edge: In experiments by Laura Kotovsky and Renee Baillargeon, for example, females start to learn about the relation between force and acceleration (the harder a stationary object is hit, the further it goes) a month earlier than males do. Males catch up, however: by 6 1/2 months, you can't tell them apart.</i>""<p><i>""Whatever the newborn infants in Baron-Cohen's experiment were doing, the male and female participants in three decades of infant research have followed a common path, engaging with objects and people. Infants don't choose whether to systematize or empathize; they do both, and so do we all. Baron-Cohen's categories may seem as quaint as left and right brains by the time his newborn subjects are old enough to read about them.</i>""<p>[1] More at <a href=""http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge158.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge158.html</a> (Search for her name as there are a lot of people there tearing Simon Baren-Cohen a new one.)<p>[2] Her Bio <a href=""http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/index.html?spelke.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~lds/index.html?spelke.html</a>",1332805942

But let me walk through them with you and perhaps we'll get to a similar place ...<p><i>""All 3 solutions run Skype, let you create and manipulate documents and play games.""</i><p>You've outlined some desirable features of this 'computer.' Skype, documents, and game playing. There is a trap here which I've discovered and that is with price. If a computer is 'expensive,' and any new laptop, netbook, or desktop computer will fall into that category, it has to have things which justify its existence/purchase. On the other hand, if the computer does not cost very much, people often dismiss it as a toy. (We have many exemplars from LeapFrog and others which fit this category).<p>If you had the equivalent of an Apple II (but upgraded to some recent microprocessors) you could have a computer which was programmable (and games of the type that make you think versus fast twitch) could be made for it, and on which you could edit documents but not change fonts or any of that stuff necessarily. And it cost less than $50 and the only 'breakable' parts were the keyboard and the TV you hooked it up to, it might be a different story.<p><i>""An Android tablet would seem to be the best solution when coupled with App Inventor. Sadly App Inventor doesn't run on Android itself so you have to have a non-Android computer to do your development work.""</i><p>This is one of those things that is an issue for me as well. When I tried to use Arduinioes for teaching programming you run into a barrier of getting <i>two</i> computers rather than just one. And sadly the ecosystem of windows, Linux, and MacOS make compatibility a real drain.<p><i>""I could of course setup emulators so she gets a Sinclair Spectrum and Apple //e and can learn just how I did, but things have moved on.""</i><p>I would hear more about 'moved on' ? Do you mean that you have moved on? Or that computer science has moved on? The beauty of these simple systems is that they are simple. They teach you to 'think' computer and that is tremendously powerful when you attack more modern systems. Sort of like a lawn mower motor on a tube frame with a centrifugal clutch isn't really a 'motorcycle' (its a minibike) but it is a great teaching tool on the concepts involved.<p>One of the areas that could use help on today is graphics. Back in the day there were some great pre-packaged graphics chips with full documentation that you could use to attach to your microprocessor. Sadly those days are gone. The good news however is that nearly every 'intro to FPGAs' class has a part where you build a video chip out of an FPGA. And they are now as cheap as those old customs chips. I've spec'd out a design which is a dual buffered HDMI output with a sprite based HW cursor. Its surprisingly cost effective (parts wise), and since it doesn't care about HDCP compliance its actually pretty simple.<p>With an open access graphics subsystem, a modest ARM core CPU, some memory, and USB plugs for ""disks"" and ""keyboards"" I think we could build a system that works well for learning about computers from 'Wow' to pretty sophisticated data structures.

We all have a suit in our respective closets, but it's just taking up space for most of the year.  Now, we're different enough sizes that we couldn't all just share one suit, but, if you had a few thousand clients, you could certainly send a fitting suit to the fellow who needs it, when he needs it.<p>There's also a huge boon to be found in having branches in both hemispheres.  Instead of spending December paying the land tax on a warehouse full of shorts, just rent them out in Australia.  Then, come July, send out the shorts in the US and the sweaters down under.<p>I'm not sure about the environmental impact.  On the one hand, you have quite a bit of carbon footprint from shipping the clothes all around.  On the other hand, the company would have a strong economic incentive to maintain the clothes.  I'm betting a lot of clothes that are currently thrown away could be saved with proper cleaning and sewing skills.  I'm now imagining reading the company's blog having less posts on Redis integration and far more on their new way to remove grass stains.<p>Honestly, given the sizing issues, this probably makes more sense for men's clothes, but that avoids competition with 99dresses.<p>Dammit.

While I wouldn't deny that most people are going to have a better experience on Windows or OSX right now, I believe that as the commercial software world becomes increasingly focused on web, tablet, and mobile platforms, room appears for the ""open-source desktop"" - Linux or otherwise - to experience a renaissance.<p>The open-source ecosystem accomplishes something no company really wants to bother with - maintaining and polishing up old working code. Over a period of a few years that is no advantage, but when you start taking a decades-long view, old solved problems want to stay solved, and open-source increasingly becomes the option that gets you there faster.<p>And the cutting edge has already moved on. Although there are still plenty of high-end tasks that need the kind of deep hardware access you only get on desktops, the web has proven that it can do an increasing breadth of high quality apps - and so have the mobile environments. If you're selling software, you want to be on those platforms if you can, despite all their maturity problems.",1332803345
