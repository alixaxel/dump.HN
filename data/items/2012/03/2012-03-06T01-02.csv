You can't get more than you've got.... no matter what you do. There is no magic.   You upsample so you drive harmonics generated in the digital-to-analog process during playback further up in the spectrum so when you get to the analog stage you can use a nice gentle analog filter to filter them out.   Without the upsampling, you need a nasty steep analog filter to filter them out, and that can have audible side-effects (or at least measurable) in the  audible spectrum.

3669275,comment,3663672,3665088,1,0,tsotha,,,">Well the maker of the Zeppelin NT is the original Eckener entity that created the Zeppelins, so to the extent that a ""Zeppelin"" is an airship built by Luftschiffbau Zeppelin GmbH, the Zeppelin NT is a real Zeppelin.<p>Well, yes.  He said ""this is a Zeppelin, not a blimp"", which is a lot like saying ""this is a Chevy, not a butterfly"".  A blimp built by Zeppelin would still be a Zeppelin, and Zeppelin builds all sorts of things that aren't related to airships.<p>The reason I don't think it will scale well is, like a blimp, pressurization of the gas bag is what keeps a hybrid in the proper shape.  This means as the size of the airship increases the envelop pressure must also increase to deal with greater external forces, making the lifting gas heavier and therefor less efficient.<p>The US navy fielded blimps larger than the Hindenburg until the early '60s, but they were never able to get more than about half the Hindenburg's lift capability for this reason.<p>With a hybrid you still get the benefit of placing engine pods more efficiently and you don't have to worry about the nose collapsing if you go too fast.  However, if you were going to go through the trouble and expense of building an 800 ft airship there's no reason to sacrifice that much lift.",1330997976

Since Twitter's JS platform is about doing all of the HTML rendering on the client-side that has to be taken into account (this wasn't a concern in the past when it was mostly done on the server-side). If the page takes 3s ~ 5s to load even with a warm cache and a tiny (size) ajax-request, then it sort of defeats the purpose (unless your purpose is to relieve server-load instead of in-browser load times).",1330997966

When it kicks into the chorus, it becomes totally distorted and everything in the midrange bleeds into each other. It's a mess.<p>Then, try listening to the 24/96 Immersion box set copy or a vinyl-sourced 24/96 rip and you'll find it's gone. When the song gets complex and loud, everything remains totally clear, each instrument stands on it's own, it doesn't become an awful distorted jumble.<p>You could argue that it's just the quality of the master that makes the difference; but if you take a copy of the original transcoded to 16/44 and compare it again with the 24/96 copy you can hear the same effect.<p>Why would anyone argue against high-resolution audio anyway? Sure, most everyone will probably just continue downloading 16/44 MP3s, but at least give us the option to have 24bit FLACs of the stuff we really like. Please and thank you.",1330997310

If people want to pay for 24/192, and even he just admitted that they will legitimately enjoy it more, how can you conclude there is no point?<p>Ultimately, sure. The world is full of products and services which only add value in this weak sense.<p>If the same wine tastes better if it's  priced higher, then it still tastes better. But I think it's only honest that the consumer be aware that the increased utility from being priced higher is due solely to the fact of it being priced higher. Beyond that, I don't care.<p>One thing we can all agree on is that music is much more enjoyable if you think you're listening to it through good equipment or from a good source. Ultimately it's only the `thinking' part that matters. So I would make two points:<p>1. One point he's making is that playing audio sampled at 192khz through regular equipement actively distorts the music in negative ways. So now if you know this now you should enjoy that music _less_.<p>2. If you're adept metacognition (maybe that's not the right word), you'll realize a) you can get most of the enjoyment by buying equipment that's `pretty decent', and then not worry about it too much. b) you're probably fooling yourself by spending so much time/money worrying about having the best equipment, so you're probably not getting the maximum utility from the experience anyway. Or maybe it's the experience of trying to get the best equipment it self that's enjoyable, not necessarily the increased audio fidelity.",1330997037

It's the same signal, same bandwidth and everything. Duplicate the stream and add a 1 sample delay to one of the channels. When you hit play, that delay would be there. If you downsampled the 44.1kHz signals after applying the delay to one of the channels, you would <i>almost</i> hear the same thing. The difference is that you could not detect the difference between the signals until after a few samples. With the 192kHz stream it would be unambiguous after 2.<p>Remember, Nyquist-Shannon holds if you have an infinite number of samples. If your ears could look into the future then what you say is perfectly correct, but they need time to collect enough samples to identify any timing discrepancies.",1330996837

There is going to be a limit based on the grain and the size of the film (35mm, Super, IMAX). 65mm film shot is going to be of higher quality than what digital is capable of today.<p>While I have no doubt that digital will eventually catch up and surpass film, there inevitably is going to be a transition period where quality films were recorded (let's just say at 2k) where the input is constrained and extrapolation be the only available option.<p>4k is the current state of the art. It will not be so forever and because it's recorded at 4k, we can't go back and extract more dynamic range due to the limitation of the sensor. Whereas you can go back, redigitize an IMAX film (say Chronos shot in 1985) that is in good condition and get way more info than something shot on 4k yesterday.<p>TL;DR IMO input still absolutely matters. 35mm is not the upper limit. We went through this with photography and am now doing the same with video/film.<p>EDIT: After thinking more about it, here's a more extreme example. I purchased a Kodak DC20 back in the 90s (early adopter yay!), even if the camera had decent glass, there's no way I can go back to an image captured by that camera and magically get the equivalent of 22mp 5D camera by resampling. If I had used a film camera, I can get a much improved scan.<p>EDIT2: Here's a good example. Slumdog Millionaire was mostly shot on a SI-2K which recorded at 2k. You can't go back and get 4k output on the digital portions.
