He is being downvoted for pointing out one of the biggest serious issues with digital content licensing: The problem isn't just the DRM, but also that the licensing agreements usually (always?) destroy the traditional right to resell your book/movie/album when you are sick of it, or just when you would rather that a friend have it (say, when you finish reading a book).<p>Paying say $15 for an ebook that is nontransferrable, when the physical book is ALSO $15, is an absurdity that I can't imagine will stand the test of time.

(e.g. Jerry Yang, Michael Dell, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield of Ben and Jerry's)<p>However, there is a huge ""BUT"" in the statement of suggesting entrepreneurs shouldn't go to college - and that is entrepreneurs SHOULD go to college.  Let me explain:<p>While I wholeheartedly believe ambitious, talented, and opportunistic entrepreneurs don't necessarily need to finish college and get a degree to be successful, I do believe they need to be smart enough to get into a good university to begin with so they can meet the right people and find co-founders.<p>Even though I grew up in a pretty affluent suburb, almost none of my high school classmates ended up being entrepreneurs or tech entrepreneurs.  Had I ventured out on my own without the college experience, I would most likely still be trying to create my first successful venture at the age of 40.<p>For many of the entrepreneurs you listed, they found their opportunity and market while in college.  If the schools had not asked the right questions or if they had not had the opportunity to be in an environment where they observed a need, many would have never founded their dorm room start ups.<p>tl;dr: get into a great college, even if you don't plan on graduating.",1332309123

3733290,comment,3728885,3730407,2,0,lemming,,,"What you're describing is CPS, but that's not how continuations would typically be used in a webapp, it's actually a compiler technique (I've always thought it was crazy that node.js forces you to do by hand something that should be done by the compiler). A language that supports full continuations as first class objects, for example some Scheme implementations, allow you to actually suspend the current execution (including the entire call stack) and store it somewhere, and then start executing it again at a later point in time. So your web container can start running a thread of execution for a particular request, suspend it after it writes its response then resume it again when it receives the next request corresponding to this web session. It allows you to write code like:<p><pre><code>    function handleSession() {\n      renderFormPage()   // writes response with HTML for form\n      suspend()          // wait for next request in the session\n      processForm()      // process the form data - notice this is the same function\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIt's a very powerful technique and can make web programming very intuitive since you can have a single linear flow for a complex web interaction.<p>Check out Chris Double's tutorial on this:<p><a href=""http://double.co.nz/scheme/modal-web-server.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://double.co.nz/scheme/modal-web-server.html</a><p>Or SISC-Web for a simple but complete implementation:<p><a href=""http://siscweb.sourceforge.net/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siscweb.sourceforge.net/overview.html</a>",1332308505

His motion looks like a kite, when he's flapping wildly the front of his chest stays pretty stable and looks like it's anchored.

If it does, we cry foul and the developer updates a patch hopefully within a few days or weeks.<p>On a production environment, this is much different.

The big movie pushes I've seen this year are John Carter, based on a character that first appeared a hundred years ago, and the Hunger Games, based on a book series that first appeared less than four years ago. Then I see a new Three Stooges film coming out that, among other crazy things, features an appearance of several Jersey Shore cast members. Many other big budget films this year are sequels: Wrath of the Titans, The Avengers, Men In Black 3, etc.<p>And here, Prufrock451 is a lucky one. Hollywood is starving for ideas, but even when innovative writers come up with a good idea, Hollywood prefers to go with established money-makers and often red-lights obscure ideas. I think they're so willing to go with Prufrock451's story because it got so popular on reddit. There's lower risk. They see that this story can attract a lot of eyeballs, and are hoping that those eyeballs will translate to box office success.<p>Hollywood likes to blame its decline on pirating, but in reality there are very few new ideas coming out of Hollywood anymore, and they expect to make money repackaging old ideas, putting them in 3D and charging a premium. Hopefully stories like Prufrock451's become more common and we get to see more original ideas make it to the big screen.

People don't like getting signed up for things they didn't ask for, and getting listed on (say) a Science Fiction (<a href=""http://scifi.stackexchange.com/users"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scifi.stackexchange.com/users</a>) site that didn't even exist when they registered would be sort of evil.  I don't think Reddit even has a user list page, so it's less of a concern there.<p>- I don't think the Reddit/Stack Exchange parallel really works in this argument.  There are two big differences that I think matter in particular.<p>1. The unit of work is wildly different.<p>Subreddit's can survive on link submissions alone, which is pretty effortless.  Comments and voting are gravy, certainly useful gravy, but not absolutely essential.<p>A Stack Exchange needs both question askers and answer posters in pretty non-trivial quantities on day one.  Askers will get frustrated and leave if they aren't getting answers, and answerers will get bored and leave if there's nothing for them to do.  Both units of work are also pretty large compared to link sharing.  This is why the Area 51 process has a commitment phase, to help get enough of both types of users into the beta on day one.<p>2.  Subreddits are basically aggregating content (link sharing and all), Stack Exchanges are creating it.  Both are useful functions, but the failure cases are pretty different.  A failed Subreddit has some links that go to maybe boring, maybe useless, but <i>already existing</i> content.  A failed Stack Exchange has enough questions to give users some hope, but not enough answers to actually help them.<p>Basically, a dead Stack Exchange is much more likely to ensnare people and waste their time than a dead Subreddit which makes leaving them up sort of evil.  This is a major reason for high-bars for site creation, and killing the failures that still slip through (<a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/pruning-season/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/09/pruning-season/</a>).<p>All that being said, we are constantly looking at the Area 51 process and keep making refinements.  It's nowhere near a perfect, or even complete system yet.  I'd be shocked if there weren't major changes in the future.<p>- This feature actually exists, it's just very much for power-users<p><a href=""http://stackexchange.com/filters/new"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackexchange.com/filters/new</a> - find questions across the Stack Exchange network based on site and tag combinations.<p><a href=""http://stackexchange.com/filters/favorite-tags"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackexchange.com/filters/favorite-tags</a> - your favorited tags across all your accounts on the Stack Exchange network.<p>What we've found is that most people are active on a single site, typically their hobby or profession.  Something they're passionate about, anyway.  It's much rarer for people to be heavily active in more than one (non-meta/governmental) Stack Exchange.  While we do build tools for those folks (like the above), I suspect that one or maybe two Stack Exchange per person is the natural state of things.  The unit of work is again really different (and larger) when compared to Reddit, which is probably the root cause of such behavior.<p>---<p>So... I guess the TL;DR is that while there are <i>some</i> Reddit parallels in Stack Exchange, I really don't think most of these hold up.  Mostly because Q&A is pretty different from link sharing.",1332307461

However.....  I was spending two hours a day reading while taking care of my second child (feeding him, holding him while he was asleep, etc.  Wonderful times.<p>Anyway, I was reading Plutarch's ""Life of Lycurgas"" where he talks at length about sexuality in ancient Sparta.  Plutarch is a witty and very interesting ancient author.  I have enjoyed reading most of the works I have read by him.  Anyway, he talks at length about the social <i>functions</i> of pederasty (from other sources, presumably non-penetrative) and wife-swapping in ancient Sparta, and the upshot is that both of these have to be seen, if we take him seriously, as back-bone institutions on which Sparta's political structure was built (reading van Gennep's ""The Rites of Passage"" has only further solidified this view in my head btw).<p>Anyway, this brought up an interesting question for me.  In our culture we say that sexual orientation is something people are born with but is that really true?  How fluid is this really?  Logically, the only answer I could provide given the material I had read was that it had to be fairly fluid, and that if I was born in such a society, I would probably be happy living out these norms.  That puzzled me for a bit.<p>But then the realization hit, and that was that these things <i>are</i> deeply fluid.  You can't cure someone from being ""gay"" and make them ""straight"" because these are both artificial restraints.  And all the sudden, the male body became erotic for me.  The female body never lost the eroticism attached, but I began to see how sexualized the male body could be also.<p>So I don't know what these categories even mean anymore.",1332306061
