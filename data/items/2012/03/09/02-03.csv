Based on actual experience, I've found the two biggest problems living in apartments -- well, sharing walls/floors/ceilings with strangers, anyway -- is the noisey neighbors phenomenon, and the smoking/non-smoking thing. No matter what the official policy is on noise, there will be that guy who decides to operate what sounds like a jackhammer at midnight, on a work night. Or you'll be in an absolutely non-smoking building, floor, apartment, etc. and yet this mysterious cigarette smoke will come out of the ventilation system.<p>Providing a small living space? Not that hard of a problem.<p>Solving the rude neighbors problem and/or totally insulating/mitigating it? Harder. (Still not impossible, in my judgment.)",1331261410

A bit (heh) thicker than this (used a lightbox and just put the border piece at the front of the box) and a less pixel-dense screen, but otherwise comparable. Told my father to put pictures in a folder that was shared via Samba and they magically appear and rotate on the picture frame. It's still running, though I had to edit the wireless key on it once (fortunately I was forward thinking enough to create a separate FAT partition where my config files are read from).

Also, it doesn't look like the iFrame can be in portrait mode, and the one I have didn't come with a wall wart.<p>Oh, and this one has a tiny brass peg that presses the home button for you, if you ever need to hit it.

At least Opera and Firefox already had (a long time ago) a way to customize the mailto handler to open a given client / webmail client. However, that process was way to difficult and obscure for most users. So -and given they have a special interest in it- Chrome became the first ever browser to come up with a frictionless webmail setup (only for Gmail, obviously). Anyway, as others stated here, it is not so clear for users: I had my girlfriend asking me what that message meant, and I was thinking it twice before answering her.<p>Besides the excursus, as tikhonj said, if that idea becomes a trend, it could modify a bit the landscape. I feel comfortable when I can choose.<p>A problem I had with forms is that people may and will eventually mistype their address. And, from a customer relation management point of view, that is a very bad thing, as you will never be able to get back to the user (if you are not asking for another way to contact, and even in that case, you could not get back to them). On the other hand, an email has always a sender.<p>It's also a fact that an email could easily become unnoticed in the spam folder. That's why I've found myself wondering if there could be room for a service that would fill the gap between both solutions (and be convenient for the sender and the receiver).<p>Regards!",1331260932

I wasn't confused at all, actually your explanation was good and basically makes sense to me. Maybe not ideal, but that being said, the fact that you were able to come up with what looks like a pretty decent work around is really a credit to the process. The command line Ant tools enable all kinds of customized stuff as well as supporting using tools other than Eclipse. (at my last job we heavily customized it to support building ""branded"" apps that were released to the market with different package names and images) I'm pretty glad that they based the build system on it, even though Ant itself is terrifying.<p>I guess after working on BlackBerry apps, I'm spoiled by Android's tools.

If the price were right (say $500 or so), it could be a nice way to live in a great part of town without spending a ton of money. One of the joys of urban living is that the city is your extra rooms. You don't need thousands of square feet and a huge yard.<p>And if this place were $500 or so, you would have plenty of cash to go out and enjoy the city on a daily basis. But at $1,600 a month, only someone with a lot of money could afford to live there and enjoy the city a lot, which I think defeats the purpose of this kind of living arrangement. $1,600 would get you at least a studio in a very nice part of DC.<p>100 years ago, it was common for people to live in apartments that didn't have kitchens.
