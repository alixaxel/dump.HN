The examples the author picked are bad, but the rest of the documentation is not much better. It's rather unfortunate, since this is supposed to be an important resource for beginners. But when I look at the page for <i>cherry-pick</i> and I see in the description...<p><i>Given one existing commit, apply the change the patch introduces, and record a new commit that records it. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).</i><p>...I can predict that newbies will have a hard time agreeing that Git is ""dead simple"".

I've heard Buddhists monks relate: its like catching a glimpse of Nirvana without the spiritual work necessary to prepare you for it.  Yes, seeing the awesome potential and absolute miracle of consciousness and life can be a truly ecstatic experience.  But, being brought face-to-face with your failings and inadequacies before you're ready to see can be equally harrowing.<p>Towards the end, I was left to realize that although I kept showing up to class the lessons were over.

Exceptions being thrown should not normally be a sign of a bug; knowing the line number the exception thrown should be irrelevant information almost all the time, save for errors like access violations or null pointer exceptions.<p>Instead, the information contained in an exception can usually be turned into actionable data to a user or administrator of an app (depending on whether it's on the client or server).",1331277984
