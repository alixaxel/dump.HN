Exponential backoff or something.<p>You could also serve bad data back to them when they get so far into the tarpit.<p>It all depends on how much work it's worth doing.<p>Id love to hear more ideas, it's a fascinating question.

Basically what we could already do in 1996 but using more resources and full of ads and other distractions. And yet to many people this step backwards represents state of the art computing. ""Productivity"" is highly overrated. Computers are already extremely useful without a bunch of gimmicks. Most of the Web 2.0 companies are creating the desire for their own product. Facebook has turned family photo sharing into a circus show. It doesn't serve any need other than to push for more neomaniacal computerisation. Some people will want to share family photos over the web. We can do that with very simple software. It can even be loaded on demand and sandboxed without any configuration without a hugely complex platform. _Simple_ virtual machines capable of this kind of work aren't hard to construct. But people keep chasing idiotic benchmarks instead. And if it's too slow then change the hardware to make sandboxing easier.",1332125815

It turns out that the way randomization was done differed across countries. Detection of what procedures were done differed across groups. Treatment also differed across groups: for those randomized to screening, treatment was at major academic centers, suggesting that they may have had better care. I would think that this would make it more likely to cause a false rejection of the null hypothesis re: all-cause mortality, so I don't think it calls into question that part of the study. But it does trigger some concerns re: study design. A related editorial in the NEJM raises some of the points, too.",1332125740

I currently have about 6 tmux tabs open, each split with various windows.  Some will have vim inside, and vim will have it's own windows and tabs separate from tmux. It sounds confusing, but it's actually very simple to keep everything straight.<p>My tmux tabs are all named for their purpose.  So, if I'm working on different areas in a project, I can easily move to that area and focus on that.<p>tmux also supports having different sessions.  So, I can open one session, and if I have to move to a completely different project, I can open up a session for that.<p>As for file access, their are numerous plugins for vim that accomplish that.  I think they are NerdTree and something else I can't remember?  Not sure, I don't use them.  With tmux, I can have a pane opened up and just use the command line to see everything.<p>But as for seeing what you have open, tmux and vim give you numerous ways to do this, as well as move through all those screens, easily in many different ways, far easier than any IDE I've ever seen.",1332125658

Remember, we're building simple applications here so things don't need to constantly write off the the disk for various tasks.

We can instead exchange information-based products.</i><p>The article doesn't mention Lanier's extensive writing on what he calls Digital Maoism: the notion that collectives always solve problems better than individuals, who should give their digital content away for free. If there were some way of monetizing this digital content that did not benefit only a few well-positioned social networking hubs and that did not require draconian intellectual property legislation (which mainly benefits a few monopolists), then there might be some hope.",1332122650

So a given satellite in orbit does not necessarily need to pass over the United States. This is why you have to get on your roof and point the dish at some magical place in the sky. You're pointing it at the satellite",1332122473

Some of the problems don't carry over (the ones about the audience as a mass), but some do (sentences going by like a stream neither the speaker nor the listener can as easily go back and forth over). I feel we're losing something from when a book was the way to reach an audience, and we could add the interactivity and a lot of the other new advantages without losing the benefits of text.<p>Funny how that line about ""The moving finger, having writ"" has it backwards now with text easier to revise than speech.
