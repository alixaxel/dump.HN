Water takes 2,257,000 joules / kg to evaporate
Which works out to ~1,600 kg or 422 gallons of water per hour per MW.<p>However, I don't think they actually want to evaporate all that much water which leaves a lot of residue issues and instead focus on heating a much larger volume of water.<p>PS: The article is also wrong in that they don't directly cool hot air from their servers with this water.  They are cooling air heated by there cooling system and depending on how hot the air from there servers are they may simply vent that if it's warmer than the outside air.",1331953172
