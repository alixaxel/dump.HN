3669586,comment,3668152,3668152,11,0,gavanwoolery,,,"I'm sick of a different kind of BS.  Generally speaking, creating startups has become almost as ""meaningless"" as trading stocks.  You used to buy a stock because you believed in the long-term value of the company.  Now you buy a stock because people panic on that given day and you feel you can take brief ownership of it to squeeze a few pennies out of it, before dumping it back on the market.<p>Why do VCs love startups?  Because you can create value where there is none.  Somehow 1,000,000 users capable of generating $200,000 in ad revenue per year (never mind the startup is burning 2 million a year!) are able to create valuations of $50 million.  But hey, hot investors X, Y, and Z are in on this deal so it must be good!  And thus the creation of companies no one gives two shits about continues.<p>How many startups are actually profitable - that is, genuinely creating more cash than they are burning? I think I can count them on one hand.",1331006284

3669583,comment,3668310,3668920,13,0,zohebv,,,"> Basically, if you produce two ultrasonic frequencies, they will create an interference pattern at a much lower frequency than either of the individual frequencies.<p>So the interference pattern will be made up of one low frequency sound and higher frequency harmonics. Once again the higher frequency harmonics are redundant, because you only need to record the lower frequency sound.<p>The only possible way ultrasound can be picked up by the ear is if the ear has a non-linear response to the input sound. Going by the information in the article linked, it is highly unlikely that any significant non-linearity exists in the ear.",1331006203
3669582,comment,3669421,3669491,4,0,rdl,,,"I suspect you could meet the assets test if you valued your business correctly.  I've talked to some lawyers, and shares in a non-public corporation at whatever reasonable valuation count.  Thus, it's not too hard for an entrepreneur to be an accredited investor after a round or two of financing.<p>(Ultimately it comes down to the portfolio companies trusting that you won't turn this into an issue later with the SEC, if things go south.)<p>The problem of not actually having the cash to invest, though, is harder.  You also clearly add value being your cash, so you could probably make investments on that basis (as consulting services partially paid in equity, etc.), which don't fall under the accredited investor requirement, since it's not a solicitation to the public.",1331006156
3669581,comment,3669421,3669421,1,0,neovive,,,"This parallels the changes in consumer banking since the introduction of the ATM.  It's now rare for most people to interact with bank staff  beyond opening an account or taking out a loan.<p>Supermarkets are another great example of self-service automation.  For example, my local supermarket has 8 self-checkout lanes occupying the same space as 4 full-service cashier lanes.  Only one staff member is required to support these lanes -- although they should have two considering there is no training requirement for the customers :).  It's interesting to note that there is no discount for using the self-checkout, although you are now scanning and bagging yourself as opposed to the full-service you receive in the standard cashier.  I assume this is the ""cost"" of progress (and shorter lines).<p>In the long-term, I think the restaurants that leverage technology to enhance the dining experience will benefit greatly (e.g. enhanced menus, reduced printing, order ahead, entertainment, brand engagement, etc.).  Restaurants that simply use tablets for cost-cutting will lose customers. 
Dining in a restaurant is more discretionary than banking or supermarket shopping.",1331006154

3669577,comment,3666478,3668474,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Wasn't really thinking about Supreme Court filings, I was thinking the more mundane civil filings that happen day in and day out in say Santa Clara County Superior Court [1] where you can get a copy of all the documents filed in all the cases where the judge hasn't ordered the documents sealed.<p>I realize its kind of an odd thing to do, but you can go down to any US court house and just sit in the gallery and listen/watch. There are people who do this for Groklaw when they were following every bit of the SCO/Novell litigation.<p>The Novell/SCO case (and Groklaw for that matter) provide what I think would be a great service (when combined with copies of the original documents) so in the Novell/SCO case there were agreements about the assignment of copyright (or not) and how they were pleaded both by the defense and the prosecution. Reading how they were attacked and how they were defended gives tremendous insights into how such documents get litigated. Of course it costs time and money to have someone do that, but that (rather than just copying various public web sources for documents) would provide a real value proposition for someone who was trying to either come up with a document for this or wanted to know what questions/guidance they should give their attorney who is preparing such a document.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.scscourt.org/self_help/civil/faqs/docket.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scscourt.org/self_help/civil/faqs/docket.shtml</a>",1331005975

3669523,comment,3669263,3669263,4,0,srean,,,"With years of practice SEO engineers have become quite good at gaming PageRank. So by itself PageRank is not a good signal of quality anymore. This is by no means a revelation. But what really amused me when I tried computing PageRank on sample webgraph was that it had become such an awesome indicator of porn! For some reason I had not seen that coming.<p>Some of the easy to exploit loop holes of PageRank give you a glimpse of the nature of the internet a decade ago. Compared to other link-analysis based indices that were prevalent in those early search-engine days, Pagerank was quite robust against spam. But it had this one loophole - ""free rank"" that all pages on the web received.<p>One way to view PageRank is to think of pages as participants in an economy. They pages paid a flat rate 15% tax to the powers-that-be and the remaining they had to pay it forwards via their outlinks. The powers-that-be would collect all the tax and then re-share the collection equally among all the pages. And that ""equal"" sharing turns out to be a loop hole now.<p>Unlike a decade ago, creating a page (and thereby getting free PageRank tokens) comes practically for free. One can create thousands upon thousands of pages dynamically at zero marginal cost, if not millions.

The C-like syntax of your typical GL shader language is particularly encouraging in this regard (not to suggest for a moment that Looking Like C is a generally positive attribute).<p>Recently I have been giving it a little further inspection, and of course it is not quite so cut and dry.  Given the Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) nature, you are somewhere pretty good, roughly between a programmable DSP and Full Gory Petaflop Gigacluster.<p>BUT.  You get:<p>- No recursion, but maybe we can just be careful and collapse everything into loops.<p>- No memory management (yay, maybe), but that makes sense since we're trying to execute everything in parallel.  Perhaps we can squeeze our dynamic programming into a local 4x4 matrix?<p>- Expensive branching, especially particularly very expensive if it's data-dependent branching which goes different ways in different kernels.  This definitely makes sense if you think of the GPU as a hungry hoarde of soldiers marching along in lockstep, slaying the data, then somebody has to stop to handle an edge case and everyone else waits around ... I'd kinda envisaged it more as an N-microthread model with a bunch of workers churning through vertices and fragments as they become available.  Probably it is time to take a break from web services until I get over this, or develop an SOA GPU In The Cloud (GPUaaS?).<p>- &c. &c.<p>So, obviously there are some tasks which are well suited for this, and idioms which are well supported.  Other tasks and other habits don't fare very well at all.  Maybe an amazing recursive raytracer which was optimised for C is not going to survive a transition to GLSL without some very clever trickery, but perhaps there are subtasks which can be handed off instead.<p>The very interesting work being done on WebGL (Webkit, Firefox, Opera thankyouverymuch) seems to have the potential to bubble the GPU to the surface where it can be used and abused with a very small activation energy.  I think it would be nice to have some shader skills in the toolkit just in case the right problem comes along.<p>TL;DR: GPU programming is a lot more like learning a new programming language than I thought.",1331004297
