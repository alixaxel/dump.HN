They make following control flow basically impossible. They are equivalent to COME FROM.<p>Go's multiple returns and defer/panic/recover are a much cleaner way to handle errors, not perfect, but way superior to exceptions.<p>> Go ignored parametric polymorphism (aka generics)<p>Go didn't ignore parametric polymorphism, Go already has features (interfaces and slices/maps) that provide most of what people use generics for. Go might even get generics some day if a good design for them is found. But the people using Go every day don't miss generics, and that is because the language itself already provides what people needs.<p>Also note that C lacks both exceptions and generics, and many people still consider it the best language around to build many kinds of systems.",1332640662

3751432,comment,3746692,3749213,1,0,sausagefeet,,,"ML's and C# have their strengths and weaknesses, but from a type theory perspective, ML's type system is simply much more powerful when it comes to ensuring correct code than C#'s.  Take, for example, your implementation of Head, what if you messed up and wrote:<p>> return (list.Count == 0) ? null : list[0];<p>Would the C# compiler catch it or would you not find out until runtime?  An ML compiler would tell you that function is wrong.<p>What about using Head?  If you have a list of integers, will the compiler let you do:<p>> Head(integer_list) + 2<p>An ML compiler won't, because it's not safe.<p>> This isn't strictly the same as what you described if ""None"" is different from ""null"".<p>It is, but the important thing to note is I had to specify that the function, 'hd', can return 'null', by wrapping it in the option type.  'null' is only a valid value for option types.  If I write:<p>> val hd : 'a list -> 'a<p>I could not return 'null'/None, it simply isn't valid.  And the compiler wouldn't let me.<p>> the 'option' function you have in your example<p>'option' is a type, not a function (I suppose you can make some high level argument that all types are functions over values or something, but not relevant here).  And 'option' itself isn't really even a type, it requires a type variable, so ""'a option"" is a type where ""'a"" is replaced by a concrete type at some point.  It's not doing the work you described above, it's actually defining a contract between me and users of hd and the compiler.<p>> With your code, it's easy to break the hd function by changing the implementation to return a different type. You might not even notice the bug if the different type's implementation is close enough to the right one.<p>No, it isn't actually.  If I change the return type the compiler will not compile my code.<p>> I changed a method to use an integer instead of a string<p>This cannot happen in ML, the compiler won't compile it because an integer isn't a string.  What you described is not type inference, it's dynamic typing.  The only danger of type inferencing in ML is annoying type errors during compilation.  I'm not sure you actually grok what type inferencing is.<p>> It also makes refactoring a large project much more difficult in my opinion because there is no way to distinguish between specification and implementation. Consequently, changing your implementation runs the risk of breaking your specification without being informed.<p>Actually, refactoring code in ML tends to be pretty easy.  If you change the type of something the compiler won't compile your code, so you know instantly where you messed up and can fix it.  You can construct code to make this not work, but in general that isn't the case. See <a href=""https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/101"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/101</a><p>> let the compiler do that I say!<p>Exactly, and an ML compiler definitely does more of this than the C# compiler.  At a cost, of course.<p>Your post has several statements which suggest you are ignorant of ML and type theory.  If you're interested in learning more, check out Benjamin Pierce's book ""Types and Programming Languages"".  Or just spend a weekend with Ocaml or Haskell and prepare for the compiler to frustrate you with it's strictness :)",1332639852

3751421,comment,3750091,3751134,1,0,JunkDNA,,,"It's always nice to have someone with an insider perspective around here, so thanks for taking the time to post. I think one thing that gets lost in a lot of these discussions is that there is no law of nature that says movie production will always be insanely profitable. Every reader of this site has grown up in a world where Hollywood actors and actresses (as well as directors and producers) have made exceptionally good money doing what they do (obviously not a majority of them; I realize that). However, there has been a lot of money sloshing around that system for our entire lives which has led to where we are today, with various middlemen lined up to take a cut. The thing is, while people want to be entertained, they don't necessarily <i>have</i> to spend their money (or attention) on products like movies and TV. For me personally, I find it increasingly difficult to find enjoyment in products from Hollywood. Instead of watching a movie tonight I'm noodling around on Facebook and HN. Both of them are delivering entertainment to me much more cheaply  (both from their perspective and mine) and efficiently than Hollywood. This is a real threat to Hollywood in my opinion. The video game industry is getting schooled on this now. A whole generation is growing up buying video games in the App Store for close to the price it used to cost for one turn at an arcade when I was a teenager. That is hugely disruptive to established players. But again, there is no law that says video games must cost $50. The established companies have to adapt or someone else is going to swoop in from underneath and eat their lunch.",1332639623

If the incompleteness theorem is about the limitations of an axiomatic system, why wouldn't it apply to rational thought.  If (and it's by no mean certain) rational thought and the human brain have certain rules built into it to process, interpret, and act on information from the outside world, then couldn't these hardwired rules be considered axioms?  These axioms are clearly powerful enough to express the integers and so one would conclude that there are certain propositions that are true but cannot be proven by the human brain.  Of course, the brain and it's wiring is still a matter of research, and the fact that the brain is a dynamic system with neural connections in constant flux means that the system is not static nor are these ""axioms"".<p>I don't know, I'm just thinking out loud....",1332639510

Whilst the description is a binary one, the characterisation of someone is not. If you ever do a Myers-Briggs test, the result you get back will often place you on a sliding scale of introversion-extroversion - when I did the test I was on the border of the two (slight leaning towards introversion).<p>So simply because your ex decided to have a quiet night in, doesn't suddenly means she's an introvert. Unless one is an extreme introvert or extrovert, you won't be solely displaying the one type of behaviour at all times.<p>Second, the 'state of mind' conclusion seems to be a bit of a leap of logic :) Just because someone exhibits the occasional different behaviour doesn't mean it's 'all in the head'. Would you argue that cancer suffer who have good and bad days with their pain mean that their pain is caused by a 'state of mind' rather than an actual illness?<p>Introversion/extroversion is not something you can 'think positive' your way out.

Right now, our unique pointers attack the ""shared"" part of that -- since data in the exchange heap is localized to a single task, you don't have data races, regardless of mutability. So mutable structures aren't a concern there.<p>There is the concern that unique pointers are too limited to do a lot of the kind of tasks you want to do in a parallel way, and that's where the experiments we want to do with the ""patient parent"" model come in -- you can see my colleague Niko's blog here [1] for info on that. That approach allows shared immutable data.<p>Verification has never been a goal of ours, except for the kinds of invariants you can address relatively simply in a type system. Dependent types are cool, but at the moment they're so complicated as to place the language out of reach of most programmers.
