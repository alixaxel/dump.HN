What you said is partially true, especially if your management doesn't really understand development (highly likely.) However, if you are able to look at the work that comes down, and come up with better ways to do it and engage management (rather than just being a set of hands to do their bidding) you can increase your value. You will never be as valued as you would be at a tech company, but you can try.<p>That said, there are a number of small development companies that focus on marketing. Meaning, they are small developer run companies that take on contract code work for marketing firms (mobile apps, HTML5, etc.) and they are by default developer friendly.

This means that as the independent variable changes, the confounding variable changes along with it.  Failing to take a confounding variable into account can lead to a false conclusion that the dependent variables are in a causal relationship with the independent variable.  Take, for example, a study that seeks to investigate the relationship between income levels and test scores.  Without controlling for other variables, the study finds that higher income correlates with better test scores and concludes that the two must be directly related. This is a flawed conclusion because there are many lurking confounding variables that may influence this supposedly clear-cut relationship. For example, perhaps individuals at one school received better education than those at another school.

An insertion sort does this n times.<p>For a simple array/vector that's:<p><i>search: O(n)</i><p><i>insert: O(1)</i><p><i>total takes (O(n) + O(1)) x O(n) = O(n^2)</i><p>For a linked list:<p><i>search: O(n)</i><p><i>insert: O(n)</i><p><i>total takes (O(n) + O(n)) x O(n) = O(n^2)</i><p>There we go, the algorithm takes O(n^2) for both data structures. The theory already proves that a linked list has absolutely no advantage over an array when using this algorithm. On top of that, iterating over a linked list is slower than over an array for various reasons, even thought they are both O(n). So that's where the difference is coming from.<p>The example he uses is clearly a wrong use case for a linked list, it's plain wrong to conclude that the whole data structure should never be used.",1331205378
