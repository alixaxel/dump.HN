Even <i>not-so-smart</i> people don't exercise.<p>And I'd assume that a smart student has more challenging work and higher expectations for their own academic performance, which causes them to lose sight of the benefits of exercise. In other words, a smart person will often prioritize intellectual endeavors above exercise, which is acceptable (that's much better than prioritizing TV or video games above exercise!), but I truly appreciate MIT making a statement about the importance of physical activity.

I really think the old stereotype is still the driving force behind the ""get nerds to exercise"" movement. Maybe my sample size just hasn't been large enough, but I don't see massive unfitness in the nerd-sphere on the same scale that I see massive unfitness in the general-populace-sphere. My conservative perspective is that the ratios are about the same rather than nerds being more fit in general, and that unfitness is decently location-dependent, but if someone has collected the data I'd like to see it.",1331229459

It's better because (1) the layout is easier on the eye and mind; FSTTE's dense text, with modifiers dangling shamelessly all over the place, had a kind of geek charm, but it encouraged the reader to sit down and study it, cogitate over it, and ponder over it. The Startup Manual's design is biased towards action. The authors' car repair manual image rings true. (2) This book provides advice on ""physical object""i.e. non web-based startups.\nWith its bullet point summaries interspersed throughout the text and countless vignettes that bespeak years of experience, this reminds me of, and is as good as, Richard White's The Entrepreneur's Manual.",1331229268

Some angel funded and some VC funded.  Some have done well and others have had nothing happen at.  I've always gotten decent stock options and although the specifics are different across the board, the strike price multiplied by the number of shares has always been ""affordable"" to pay out of pocket, say in the $3-5k range.  For example, a $3k options exercise check to the company would be for 30k shares at $.10 for an earlier stage co, or 1k shares at $3 for a later stage co.  This made it easy to exercise the options when leaving the company (at any vesting point).  I didn't have to wait until the company failed/IPO'd/got bought if I wasn't passionate about working there anymore, but could still walk away with some stock for my hard work.<p>I'm now presented with a new start-up opportunity.  However, unlike in the past, the options offer is a million+ shares at $.05, meaning I'd have to write an exercise check to the company for $50k+, which I deem ""unaffordable.""  I understand that I'd only exercise if the company was worth something, but if I have to leave at, say year 5 and the company hasn't sold yet but is moderately successful, I'd have to, within 90 days, come up with $50k, or a buyer for at least some portion of my shares to offset the $50k check.<p>To me, the astronomically high number of shares is a huge red flag because it's so unlike any other scenario I've experienced.  It seems like it's way worse than the usual 4-year-vesting golden handcuffs.  If it takes 8 years to get to an exit, I'd pretty much have to be there until that time if I didn't want to pay $50k out of pocket and also didn't want to walk away with nothing after several years of back-breaking work.<p>Has anyone experienced a very-high-number-of-shares options scenario like mine before?  Is it indeed a red flag?  Is the founder using the overall high number of outstanding shares (one hundred million) to take the typical ""golden handcuffs"" to the next level?",1331228445

If Dropbox was legally coerced to do so, they have the technical means to erase any file in your Dropbox from each machine as it connects to the network. I believe they already do a best-effort version of this if someone stops sharing a folder with you. All it would take is a court order to remove a file and all its backups from Dropbox's server, which might happen without even targeting you specifically because Dropbox does deduplication and doesn't encrypt your data.<p>This may be very unlikely, especially with an encrypted password database unique to you, but it's not impossible.

(save time not sharpening pencils and make a million bucks).

This is going to be very tough for purely science related projects because most of the time there may not be a tangible reward directly coming out of funding the project it self. This probably is also the reason why most successful projects on kickstarter are arts (comics, films etc), technology/retail (iphone covers, chargers etc) related. So probably you can differentiate by hosting projects will a tangible outcome for backers. For example a DIY glowing bacteria or growing indoors bonsai plants or a aeroponics/hydroponics mini setup etc... You can even try getting people to create projects that create science kits at the end along with educational videos...<p>Though one problem I see with above approaches is that you may not control what project proposals you get... that's okay as long as a portion of your projects are of tangible output type...",1331226816

3680508,comment,3679731,3679731,3,0,sophacles,,,"Somewhat tangential, here is something I have long thought would be a very useful project, but unfortunately haven't had the time to build:<p>It is a scraping/crawling tool suite. Base it on webkit, with good scriptable plugin support (not just js, but expose the DOM to other languages too). It would consist of a few main parts.<p>1) what I call the Scrape-builder. This is essentially a fancy web browser, but, it has a rich UI that can be used to select portions of a web page, and expose the appropriate DOM elements, and how to find those elements in the page. By expose, I mean put into some sort of editor/ide - It could be raw html, or some sort of description language. in the editor, the elements one would want to scrap can then be selected, and put into some sort of object for later processing. This can include some form of scripting to mangle the data as needed. It can also include interactions with the javascript on the page, recording click macros (well event firing, and such).  The point of this component is to allow content experts/non- or novice-programmers to easily arrange for the ""interesting"" data to be selected for scraping.<p>2) The second component for the suite is a scraping engine. It uses the description + macros + scripts from the Scrape-builder to actually pull data from the pages, and turn them into data objects. These objects can then be put on a queue for later processing with backend systems/code. The scraping engine is basically a stripped down webkit without the rendering/layout/display bits compiled in. It just builds the dom and executes the page's javascript to ultimately scrape the bits selected. This is driven by the spidering engine.<p>3) The spidering engine is what determines which pages to point the scraping engine at. It can be fed by external code, or it can be fed by scripts from the scraping engine, a feedback mechanism (some links on a page may be part of a single scraping, some may just be fodder for a later scraping). It can be thought of as a work queue for the scraping engines.<p>The main use-cases I see for this are specialized search and aggregation engines, which want to get at the interesting bits of sites which don't expose a good api, or where the data may be formatted, but hard to semantically infer without human intervention. Sure, it wouldn't be as efficient from a code execution point of view as say, custom  scraping scripts, but it would allow for much faster response times to page changes, and allow better use of programmer time, by taking care of a lot of boilerplate or almost-boiler plate parts of scraping scenarios.",1331226151
