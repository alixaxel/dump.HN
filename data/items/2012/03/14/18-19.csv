Animal products aren't necessary in a diet at all, and they're only useful in a fraction of the quantity that most Westerners consume. Equivalent nutrition intake can be achieved much more efficiently by directly consuming plant products. I'm ignoring the issue of taste, because I don't think that can be classified as ""misery.""<p>Also, the current cost of meat is far from fair, as large farms are externalizing the cost of perhaps the largest risk of a catastrophic event for humankind.<p>I wouldn't necessarily advocate a complete ban on antibiotic use for animals.

It is true that lots of elite students at US colleges are interested in Banking and Consulting when they graduate. They are interested because both careers are prestigious and lead to more things.<p>But the comparison is very limited.<p>There is a passage at the end of his op-ed when he talks about his first days in the values driven organization learning the ropes of what the work is, how to be productive at it, and how to take the client perspective always.<p>I worked for McKinsey from 2003-2006 and I had that same first-day experience and it was more or less my experience throughout. I talk to folks now and they still think/act this way -- values are super important, the client comes first, being smart is all about helping the client better and therefore the firm prospering in the long run. People bragged about ""we turned down the work"" ALL THE TIME because it isn't a good use of ""the client's money/time/focus"".<p>There have indeed been scandals where individuals (even the ex-head of the firm!) have done unethical things at McKinsey.<p>These are more famous <i>because</i> McKinsey is so super duper integrity focused and they are embarrassing, but they happen on a backdrop of client service.<p>And indeed many many public spirited, ""business isn't really what I'm about"" people come work at McKinsey and leave and go on to do other things.<p>The <i>big thing</i> about consulting firms like McK which is really great and different from banking -- apart from the values which may be good for their business -- is that they are places for GENERALISTS. You get there and work on a wide range of problems, with a wide range of analytics/collaborative/communication skills. This is what is great about consulting and why people go on from there to do great things.<p>In the ""old"" world of Goldman Sachs this might have been true too -- when they were investment bankers advising clients on what to do. You and client win in this scenario. But much of the firm's money these days is made from TRADING, where there is a loser on the other side -- apparently the client.",1331750845

Pinterest clearly has control over their content and arguably promotes infringement by providing a nifty browser toolbar to do it.<p>There is also the ASMP, et al vs. Google case that is still pending. See <a href=""http://asmp.org/articles/asmp-qa-google-class-action.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asmp.org/articles/asmp-qa-google-class-action.html</a><p>The issue with pinterest is the presentation of the original image. Using an image with out explicit consent is illegal even with attribution. Perfect 10 vs. Google revolved around the use of low quality thumbnail representations in search results. Pinterest is not a search engine and does not use low quality thumbnails.<p>In comparison to Tumblr, it can be argued that Tumblr has a clear purpose as a blog platform above the ability to simply re-blog content from other sites. I am sure Tumblr is inundated with DMCA takedowns as well.<p>Theoretical lawsuits against Pinterest are more likely to have success because the sole purpose of the platform is to repost third-party content (to what ever means their business model is based on). It will also be interesting to see how well they implement DMCA take-down procedures. Even if the purpose of the site is validated as fair-use, the DMCA procedures will need to be sufficiently vetted to insure they do not lose protection. The recent articles seriously calls into question Pinterest's knowledge and ability regarding handling of DMCA requirements.",1331750567

In theory, they might have less pressure to sell if they have cash flow, but it's not clear this is enough to counteract their increased appeal to an acquirer.  Rather than indicting ""free"" services, it would seem more rational to avoid ""cloud"" services whether paid or unpaid.<p>Perhap you should choose only services from companies you feel are too large to be acquired (Google) or companies whose code is available to run on your own if they were to close down (Github).  Or stick with self-hosted solutions with that plan that you can change hosts as necessary.<p>For any company you chose, I think you have to presume that while they will try to keep their service running, they will be doing so primarily out of self-interest.

So for me, this was the most relevant part of the article.  Unfortunately some customers still use IE8 (and even 7), so it would be silly of me to force a tool on them they can't use.<p>Back onto the main topic...<p>In my experience IE8 is the most important one to profile and speed up - since it is quite slower than other modern browsers.  Spending time in the IE developer tools profiling can give some pretty good gains.<p>Moving expensive code into click handlers can have the drawback of making the user Touch Points, or where the user is doing interactivity slower.  This is where users can often notice the slow down.  But I'm guessing you managed to make it take less time than 200ms, and it's probably a little touched item anyway, so probably still worth it.  The alternative is to spread the computation after load, so the user might not even notice it happen.  Or if you're modifying the DOM, why not just do it before you send it to the user - and send them html which doesn't need a lot of javascript manipulation done.<p>It also brings up the point of testing and profiling.  I noticed there was a bug report in your blog comments.  It's really helpful to have tests before you start doing profiling, and especially once you have made your changes.  Tools like speed.pypy.org are really nice for tracking performance regressions too.  So, when a developer adds some new JS functionality into your app in 4 weeks time, you can see when the performance regression was added.<p>cya",1331748393

(I was a PM before I went to MBA and then LB.)<p>The biggest problem was that there's little incentive in financial products to pursue true creativity or innovation that generates value for your clients. Both the market and the regulatory climate make it very hard, and very risky, to develop and market new products. It's a lot easier to just find innovative ways to strip value from your clients, or make new securities look a lot like old securities.<p>My role at Lehman involved helping issuers structure securities for various capital markets. I did not see us openly fleecing clients in the style of Enron or this Goldman article, but it was pretty clear that some kinds of deals were far more profitable for the firm than others, and it was going to be in your interest to promote those kinds of transaction. It's the people at the top who set the incentives and set the culture of a firm, and things will only generally get worse as they trickle down the structure to individual teams who are more interested in their personal comp than the overall corporate brand.<p>One of the main reasons I wanted to go back to tech from finance was that I felt like there's at least a lot of tech companies (Amazon and Google included) where delivering true value to the end user is the primary value, and how you get promoted and paid. I did not feel that was the case on Wall Street; it was more important how many fees your team brought in than whether the issuers (clients) were still in business a year later.",1331748320
