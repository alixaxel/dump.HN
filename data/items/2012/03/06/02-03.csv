3669447,comment,3667049,3667049,1,0,danieljomphe,,,"Thus Datomic would be very great for centrally-operated systems, but not so much with highly distributed systems where many peers are often partitioned out because, for example, they have no Internet connectivity for a few days, and they still need to operate within their limited universe.<p>So if such a highly distributed system was to use Datomic, it would be harder to guarantee that each peer can work both for reads & (local) writes while being partitioned from the transactor. One would need to program the software to log those new facts (writes) locally before submitting (syncing) them to the transactor. And make that durable. Also, one might also need to make the query/read cache durable, since there's no network to fetch it back in case of a reboot of the peer. So it seems there's a missing local middleman/proxy that needs to be implemented to support such scenarios. At least, thanks to Datalog, the local cache would still be able to be used with this log, using db.with(log).<p>What do you think, is this use case quite simply implementable over/with Datomic, without asking it to do something out of its leagues?",1331002666

On dedicated hosting on some providers, yes you will get a quicker response than from Amazon or Microsoft or whoever your cloud provider is. However, when there is a problem with their service, by the time I find out about it I am normally looking on their site to see they have already been notified of the problem and are already looking into it. And Microsoft Azure does have phone support for any critical issues.<p>The 2nd great thing about the cloud is that, it isn't just your problem. They are hundreds if not thousands of companies affected and they are more likely spending far more money than me with them. Hence I get the rapid fix of any issues, without being the big client.<p>Benchmarks - not sure why that was brought up, you can benchmark on any cloud provider. On Windows Azure I can find out everything from CPU to memory usage and do remote profiling.<p>Dedicated will give you better costs, machine to machine wise but I would rather pay $1,000 + more a month to have someone look after all my hardware and the ability to scale as a I wish, rather than have to pay someone (who would cost far more) to monitor, upgrade and plan for it continuously. If $150 to $1,500 is an issue and you are prepared to spend a large part of your own time on this insignificant issues, then I suppose you are a startup and not a business yet.<p>I understand doing everything yourself at the start, staying as lean as possible, but if you are looking at that scale and hiring people then the costs of the cloud are FAR more attractive.",1331001255

And I agree that frequencies above the threshold of hearing are more important than standard dogma (based on Nyquist theory combined with Pure tone audiometry) allows. It helps explain how audio gear with a 100kHz bandwidth sounds clearer than gear with a 20kHz bandwidth even when they measure the same in the audible band.<p>Have you read the Audio Technology magazine interview with Rupert Neve?<p>Greg Simmons: Geoff Emerick, the famous British Producer ?<p>Rupert Neve: Yes, he started me off on this trail. A 48 input console had been delivered to George Martin's Air Studios, and Geoff Emerick was very unhappy about it. It was a new console, made not long after I had sold the Neve company in 1977. George Martin called me and said, ""please come and make Geoff happy, while he's unhappy we can't do any work"".<p>They'd had engineers from the company there, and so on. The danger is that if you are not sensitive to people like Geoff Emerick, and you don't respect them for what they have done, then you are not going to listen to them. Unfortunately, there was a breed of young engineers in the company ( I hasten to say this was after I sold it !) who couldn't understand what he was bitching about. So they went back to the company and just made a report saying the customer was mad and there wasn't really a problem. Leave it alone, forget it, the problem will go away. They were acting like used car salesmen. I was very angry with it. So I went and spent time there, at George Martin's request, and Geoff finally managed to show me what it was that he could hear, and then I began to hear it, too.<p>Now Geoff was The Golden Ears - and he still is - and he was perceiving something that I wasn't looking for. And it wasn't until I had spent some time with him, as it were, being lead by him through the sounds, that I began to pick up what he was listening to. And once I'd heard it, oh yes, then I knew what he was talking about. We measured it and found that in three out of the full 48 channels, the output transformers had not been correctly terminated and were producing a 3dB rise at 54kHz. And so people said, ""oh no, he can't possible hear that"". But when we corrected that problem, and it was only one capacitor that had to be added to each of those three channels, I mean, Geoff's face just lit up !
