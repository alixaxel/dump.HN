3670351,comment,3667049,3670109,5,0,snprbob86,,,"It's about writing software which is simpler and more flexible.<p>If you write a traditional shared-nothing web app client with a traditional bag-o-sprocs database server, you'll probably be good as long as your workload doesn't change much. Assuming your write volume never exceeds that of a single (as beefy as necessary) server (which seems to be working out so far for Hacker News!) then you're ok.<p>However, products/services evolve and requirements change.  Let's assume, for example, that you want to do some heavy duty number crunching. This number crunching involves some critical business logic calculations. Some of those calculations are in sprocs, but some of them are in your application code's native language. How do you offload that work to another server? You may have to juggle logic across that sproc/app boundary back and forth. It's pretty rigid; change is hard.<p>You can think of Datomic as a way of eliminating your sproc language and moving the query engine, indexes, and data itself into your process. Basically, you get everything you need to write your own database server. Furthermore, you can write specialized database servers for specialized needs... as long as you agree to allow a single Transactor service to coordinate your writes.<p>Back to the big number crunching. You've got the my-awesome-app process chugging along & you don't want to slow it down with your number crunching, so you spin up a my-awesome-cruncher peer & the data gets loaded up over there. Now you have the full power of your database engine in (super fast) memory and you can take your database-client-side business logic with you!<p>Now let's say you're finding that you're spending a lot of CPU time doing HTML templating and other web-appy like things. Well, you can trivially make additional my-awesome-app peers to share the work load.<p>You can do all this from a very simple start: One process on one machine. Everything in memory. Plain-old-java-objects treated the same as datums. No data modeling impedance mismatch. No network latency to think about. You can punt on a lot of very hard problems without sacrificing any escape hatches. You get audit trails and recovery mechanisms virtually for free.<p>Again, all this assumes the write-serialization trade offs are acceptable. Considering the prevalence and success of single-master architectures in the wild, that's not a hugely unacceptable tradeoff. Furthermore, the append-only model may enable even higher write speeds than something like Postgres' more traditional approach.<p>I hope my rant is helpful :-)",1331027955

These letters, and CVs and degrees as far as that is concerned, only get you so far.<p>After thinking about it (and deleting my first comment), I see it as some good basic advice for first time employers. What I don't really get is the point with the trial project... Do start-ups and highly qualified experts (supposed you actually want experts) really have that much time to waste? I don't think so.<p>One important point mentioned in the comments was culture, and yes it is paramount. Especially in disruptive, small companies where you cannot afford to have the average well-adopted worker drone around you usually get from HR in bigger companies, ideally the founders are around to communicate the culture themselves. Ouliers actually are a good place to start looking if don't already know your candidates.<p>Personally, I like interviews whith people who actually have a say in the hiring, only HR usually sucks.

There are plenty of people who see the obvious problems that for instance patents in the health industry cause yet don't want to remove all regulation or government influence in the industry.

But such an agency doesn't have to be public, and in any case its power should closer resemble the ESRB's power rather than the FDA's current power (which unless I missed something over the past decade has included the power to arrest anyone at gunpoint who tries to sell an orange on the premise that it prevents a disease like scurvy).<p>Since you did ask it, this rhetorical question does have an interesting answer you're probably not aware of:<p>> What next, should we buy and sell the right to vote?<p>This seems to be working pretty well for corporations.

Sure, but why in the world are you asking me this?<p>The first question is silly. It's probably intended as a shibboleth, but it's a pretty useless one: people who can answer it probably understand what is octal/decimal/hex, but lots of people who do know octal/decimal/hex have never heard of that silly joke.<p>The second question is very easy and it's good as a first filter: if you can't answer it then it's very very likely you cannot code. They're asking it because there are indeed people who interview for that position yet cannot answer it.<p>> And FizzBuzz (linked in #1): yes I get it, it's easy and it filters out 199 out of 200 candidates, but what about those 199 other candidates? Is it not possible that among them, you might have missed other candidates whose broader set of experiences would have taught you something that you didn't know, something more important than the fact they failed FizzBuzz, for whatever inconsequential reasons?<p>I think the 1/200 ratio is rather hyperbolic and not based on any actual data. In my experience interviewing candidates for a not very well-known company (so we didn't have 1000s of candidates for every position, more like dozens), more than 2/3 of the candidates would pass the really easy questions.<p>But yes, if the candidate fails Fizzbuzz then it's probably pointless to continue the interview.
