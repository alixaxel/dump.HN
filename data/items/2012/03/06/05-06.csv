Chances are that over 3-5 years you will see a number of price discounts - one of the only providers that does this for existing purchased infrastructure, keeping your costs in line with savings from Moore's law rather than locking in for years.<p>I would like to know the complete discount history because there would be enough data points now to project estimated discounts forward",1331013565

3669816,comment,3669568,3669568,62,0,cletus,,,"As much as people like to deride #1 (here and elsewhere) it's one of the most useful filters (in terms of filter value for effort spent). It's not a positive filter (in that a candidate who passes won't necessarily be a great programmer) but it is a great negative filter (a candidate who fails almost certainly isn't).<p>#2 I have mixed feelings about. A lot of people work on things where the source code (even the product) isn't visible. Having an SO profile is semi-useful but lack of one doesn't really mean anything. Github only makes sense if you work on open source (and frankly I'm tired of the incredibly naive ""Github is the new CV"" postings that pop up every few weeks).<p>#5 is what I really object to. At least in this case you've gone through the initial filters. Some companies use an audition project as an initial filter before you've ever spoken to anyone (you know, to see if you'd be a cultural fit and so on). I have zero time for this.<p>The problem with an audition project is that anyone truly good won't have to jump through those kinds of hoops. They'll have their pick of offers as is. Job seeking through a traditional (non-network) route is relatively low percentage such that there's only so much time worth investing in any particular position.<p>I'm happy to prove to you know I have a solid enough foundation in data structures and algorithms, I can program my way out of a paper bag and I can problem solve and communicate effectively but as soon as you ask me to spend a week--even a <i>day</i>--on some audition project, forget it.<p>Honestly, hiring isn't that hard. You just need people who are good at hiring to do it. I've done 10 or so ""lunch interviews"" at Google this year. This isn't an interview per se. It's simply taking someone to lunch in between their onsite interviews. It's a chance for the candidate to unwind, ask some questions, etc. But there is no feedback element to the process.<p>Of the 10 after 10 minutes I predicted 8 wouldn't get hired, 1 would and 1 I wasn't sure about. Turns out the ""yes"" declined an offer and the ""maybe"" didn't get one and I was otherwise right. <i>And this is simply from going to lunch with them.</i><p>My formula is:<p>1. Filter early. ""Hello world"" and other simple programming tests;<p>2. Establish technical foundation and problem-solving ability  (with one algorithm-related question that should be coded); and<p>3. Otherwise ascertaining personality/cultural fit. This you should get just from talking to someone for 10-15 minutes.<p>It's really not that hard. You just need someone who can actually do it to do it.",1331013202

If you invest in a company/software product that goes under, then you could be saddled with a piece of tech that you can't fix bugs for, etc. If it's open source you at least have the chance to do so, even if the community around it collapses and there is no new development.<p>The idea that access to the source is some sort of cure-all is a fallacy, but it may also just be a straw man. I don't know that anyone says that all open source projects are going to be manageable just because the source is available, but they are by definition <i>more</i> manageable than a project with no source available.",1331011481

It's a long story, but in short I let my guard down because it was a YC company only to find myself having wasted a week. The part that really pissed me off is that they came back _months_ later and pretended that no time had passed at all (obviously their hire didn't work out) and asked me to jump through more interviewing hoops. When I rightfully just told them to put money where mouth is they actually insulted me and the free work I had done (written in an email no less).<p>The point I'm making is that if you need this many hoops for a candidate to jump through you shouldn't be the one hiring. Find someone else with a business-tuned intuition and ability to judge character. If you act like you're the world's greatest company which people will waste hours and even days trying to impress you're going to miss the best people out there.<p>Also #2:<p>""Show me a Stack Overflow profile where I can see what kind of communicator and problem solver you are. Link me to an open-source code repository of your stuff.""<p>Kinda cheesy for Jeff to say the first part. I absolutely agree with supporting both info sharing sites and open source. But as a self-taught programmer that ships products and does very well financially, I can tell you that there are effective people out there that don't rely on SO to get things done and therefore probably don't contribute to it.<p>I do absolutely support open source software but I also don't have a lot of free time. I've written a raster to vector conversion library that I'd love to clean up a bit and open source. But I literally don't have time to do so. Does that make me a second class programmer? Having hired many people over the years I know that I would look very seriously at someone who has shipped a lot of products but doesn't follow programmer community trends like SO. I guess it could mean they're truly horrible programmers with no knowledge to share. It could also mean they're too busy meeting their own (or some company's) targets. It could also mean they like to unplug once in a while and lead a normal life.<p>I understand why companies like Google take a hardline approach to hiring. They just deal with too many people. But if you're reading Jeff's essay on hiring you're not running Google. If you're a small company you need to look at the outliers first since that where you're likely to find overlooked talent. That's where you're going to find the people who don't jump through hoops but who actually get shit done on a daily basis.",1331010398
