3689799,comment,3689478,3689626,8,0,mds101,,,">the reality is that we are a dirt poor country with not just deep institutional problems, but also moral and psychological ones.<p>I was searching for the words to express this for more than ten minutes before I read your comment. The key here is 'moral and psychological problems'.<p>To cite just one example, there was a lot of ruckus about the 2G Scam and the Lokpal bill recently. We believe that the guy who got 17200 Crore rupees in kickbacks is a corrupt SOB and should be punished to the maximum extent, but when it was revealed that a leading anti-corruption crusader was actually stealing money from the sponsors who invited her for talks, we dismissed it as a 'small amount'. This kind of 'it's not a crime if its done at a small scale but it's a crime if its done on a large scale' mentality is present among nearly everyone.<p>Also, another huge problem with Indians is that we as a people do not wish to risk anything. As a result we will never fight for something that should be rightfully ours (like a Government that does it's job). Urban voters are generally brainwashed by the charisma of our politicians or are bought wholesale with a few thousand rupees and a bottle of liquor. Rural voters don't really care who they vote for.  As a result we keep alternating between the same two sets of thugs. Will we get out on the streets and protest for better governance like the arabs did? Never.<p>So, the West can paint many  pretty picture and call it India, but this is a country in massive disarray, and the fact that it hasn't already collapsed is purely by chance.",1331449126

The problem with the 75 % literacy is that many of those uneducated people are old and can not be taught now.

This is an unfair position.  There may be corruption, apathy and so on, which impede progress along these lines.  But there were similar problems in London, New York and Chicago not too long ago (and in American cities there still are such problems).  So it would a double standard to say the least to criticize Indians in this connection on one hand and, implicitly, to rest satisfied with one's own government, on the other.  If you are criticizing both them and your own society simultaneously (assuming you're not Indian), this hardly provides support for what seems to be your point that Indians aren't doing enough.

But in the absence of those good people, you still need someone to do the work. That often means settling on someone who is unskilled for, say, $10/hr. You just end up hoping the reduced pay will offset the additional costs of employing them.<p>The technology sector is different. The constraints on time are completely artificial. If a really good programmer isn't available today, the project can wait until he is available next month.

3689731,comment,3689561,3689561,4,0,nessus42,,,"I remember ages ago getting in an argument with the kernel hackers on unix-wizards. My position was that filenames shouldn't be allowed to have meta-characters in them because it made shell programming difficult and dangerous. Their argument was that the spirit of Unix was that the kernel should be as simple as it possibly could be, and that you should ""Live free or die"". Therefore it was not the kernel's business to dictate what characters should be able to be in a filename.<p>They were wrong of course. The <i>true</i> spirit of Unix was to enable programmer productivity by being able to easily piece together new programs out of reusable components. E.g., via shell scripting, and the kernel hackers' notions about filenames and living free was directly at odds with this true spirit.<p>The OP claims that they've solved this dilemma in Julia.

1. When I type a product I have to click on search button to get the result. Can it be such a way that only clicking on enter tab should do the search?
2. When I deliberately misspel a drug name it just does not return anything. Does the search engine has auto suggestion method like google's?<p>Few questions:
1. What will be the revenue model? Will it be a SAAS?
2. Will there be a free version on the web? If yes then how will it be different from paid SAAS service?
3. Will it be limited to drug molecule and genes or it will extend to other categories in future such as scientific literatures and metabolic pathways?",1331446179
