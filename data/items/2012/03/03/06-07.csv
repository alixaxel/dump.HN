Assuming a thoroughly brilliant execution, I'm certain that this app will find its fans amongst all groups within the design-build chain. Architects, construction managers, general contractors and trades. Even building owners and maintenance managers, perhaps.<p>I haven't tried the app, but having worked in both architecture and construction and now as a UX designer, I'm quite familiar with the problems it addresses. One of the biggest challenges on a construction project (even a small one) is document control and management. Though most work in architectural offices is done on computers, paper plans remain the final method of output of construction information, and this causes numerous problems.<p>Of course there is the cost of printing that the article mentions, but that's only one of several inefficiencies. A little background for those unfamiliar with construction: First, traditional prints are cumbersome, so they're difficult to pull out and reference in any kind of adverse field conditions. Large sheets of paper do not mix well with wind or rain. Even in good weather or indoors they're a pain to carry around and handle, so they tend to spend most of their time in the truck or trailer, often away from where they're really needed. To make them easier to carry, construction managers often make their own smaller photocopies of portions of the plans, which compounds the second big problem: keeping the documents up to date.<p>On a large project, keeping everyone's documents up to date is a nightmare. The more subcontractors you have, the bigger the nightmare becomes. And if you have a fast-track or rapidly evolving design-build situation, the problem is further compounded by compressed schedules. When plans or specifications are out of date, estimations are off and things get built incorrectly. You get waste, increased project costs, and the occasional lost shirt. One of my mentors used to destroy on sight any out of date documents he found people carrying. This app should be a much more elegant solution.<p>Essentially, paper plans are so difficult to manage that they waste a huge amount of time and sometimes result in errors. They're a centuries old, paper-based data bank and info graphic. So it's easy to see how this app could not only save time and money, but also increase quality and accuracy of what gets built: The people doing the work will have convenient access to the right information at the right time, through plans and other forms of location-based information on a device that's easy to carry.<p>Further, the ability to notate and communicate right from the UI has the potential to fix one of the frequently broken feedback loops in the design-build process: communication between builder and architect about unexpected field conditions or difficulties with the current design. I have no idea about the road map for the app, but there's a lot of potential here. Imagine you're able to share screens and stream video or still images back to the architect about something needing clarification, and have her be able to sketch on the plans in real time. Then the changes can be saved as a draft copy, ported back to the drafting software, modifications made and reissued as an official document (and even change orders) in a matter of minutes. The potential for this to speed construction and increase quality is not to be under-estimated.<p>As a designer, I'm very curious about the UI of the app and how well the UX is adapted to the needs of folks in the field. Because there are just so many variations on the use case, so many different ways that building plans are used by different people in the process. And, there is <i>one</i> advantage to the size of traditional printed plans. Their bigness, at times, can be a virtue when you're trying to get an understanding of the overall layout of building, and extract key dimensions from it. Of course zooming in and out is how this is handled on monitors when drafting, but I suspect the problem is a little different on an iPad size screen, the solution needing to be a little more creative to convey the needed information.<p>Phew, thinking about the possibilities of this app is exhilarating, and my apologies if my post is overly long. Congrats to the founding team for identifying and working to solve such a significant missing piece in the chain of the construction process! :)",1330757993

3659574,story,,,1,0,24x7esubmission,"Donor oocytes and menopausal pregnancy",http://www.wewantababy.com,"Female age is perhaps the biggest enemy to fertility.Advanced Age plays an important role in a woman's ability to become pregnant and carry a pregnancy to term. It has become a more prevalent cause of infertility and the fertility clinic are having more and more couples with infertility problems.There is no universal definition of advanced reproductive age in women.The American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) defines infertility as the inability to conceive after one year of unprotected,regular intercourse.The time is shortened to six months in women over 35 because of the rapid loss of fertility that can occur in this age group.These women should see a reproductive endocrinologist,infertility specialist as soon as possible.<p>Infertility in womens has increased over the last several years as more and more women choose to delay childbearing.A higher percentage of women are marrying at older ages,many are delaying childbearing until their careers are established, the divorce rate is high and many couples remarry and desire their own children.It is clear that the biological clock is not in sync with these societal changes as a womans greatest fertility occurs in her teens and twenties. The rise in the number of women waiting until later in life to have children increases their chances of infertility and remaining childless.<p>Fertility clearly declines with advancing age, especially after the mid-30s, and women who conceive are at greater risk of pregnancy complications.Egg quality declines measurably in the mid to late thirties and most women will reach perimenopause by age 43.The ages vary considerably in different women and some will experience premature menopause, which can occur much earlier.However,studies have generally shown that women over 45 years of age or over 50 years of age have good pregnancy outcomes and are able to cope with the physical and emotional stresses of pregnancy and parenting.With use of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), births have been reported to several women at the age of 66 years and at 70 also.The oldest woman to achieve a naturally conceived pregnancy was 57 years old.<p>The major hurdles faced by the women with advanced age and infertility are covered in the following.<p>1] Down Syndrome babies:\nThe advanced age in the women increases the chances of genetic problems. This is the reason for the increased risk of Down Syndrome babies in women over age 35. At age 25, 1 in 250 women will give birth to a child with Down Syndrome. At age 30, its a 1 in 952 risk, and by age 35, the chance is 1 in 378.<p>2] Miscarriage:\nAs per the statistics risk for miscarriage also rises with the age. About 10% of pregnancies end in miscarriage for women in their early 20s. By the early 30s, 12% of women experience miscarriages. After age 35, 18% of pregnancies will end in miscarriage. And in the early 40s, 34% of pregnancies end in miscarriage.<p>3] Quality of Matured Eggs:\nAs women age infertility increases.Age and infertility are directly correlated and age is a common cause of infertility.Women are born with all of the eggs that are needed for a lifetime.Once menstruation begins,an egg(s) is ovulated each month until the menopause.As women age,their eggs begin to lose their ability to fertilize and develop into a healthy fetus,the condition is known as reduced ovarian reserve.After menopause,the condition is known as ovarian failure and menopause can occur at much earlier ages than predicted.Fortunately,donor egg IVF is available for women who cannot become pregnant using their own eggs due to age related infertility.Donors are healthy, screened,younger women who wish to donate their eggs to help infertile couples.In the infertility treatment called In Vitro Fertilization (IVF),success rates using donor eggs are high being equivalent to the age of the donor.For example,if the eggs from a younger women between the age of 22-25 is used in an IVF cycle with a women aging 40 years,the success rates equal the 22-25 year old age group. Donors are compensated for their time and efforts.Those who cannot conceive with donor eggs due to some problems can also opt for surrogacy option using the services of surrogate mother.<p>4] Pre-Existing Conditions:\nAdvanced maternal age is often linked to high blood pressure and diabetes that can affect pregnancy.For example,if diabetes is not controlled,it can contribute to birth defects, miscarriage,while high blood pressure can affect fetal growth by slowing it down.<p>Egg freezing is a process that could dramatically help many women wanting to preserve their fertility.Those who are young and do not want to have pregnancy at this age have started freezing their egg for their future.Young womens who have fertile eggs are choosing the option of egg freezing for their future motherhood.<p>Donor oocytes and menopausal pregnancy: Oocyte donation to women of advanced reproductive age: pregnancy results and obstetrical outcomes in patients 45 years and older<p>However most women in their late 30s and 40s can look forward to healthy pregnancies and prevent a high risk pregnancy.Women of all ages can improve their chances of having a healthy pregnancy when they follow simple steps.<p>* Have a preconception check-up with your doctor or infertility specialist.\n* Relax and have a happy attitude. Emotional wellbeing can also affect your pregnancy.The mental state of the mother can affect the health of the child.\n* The average time it takes a couple over 35 to conceive is 1-2 years, so try to remain positive if you do not become pregnant immediately. \n* Visit your doctor at the earliest if you havent conceived after 6 months of purposeful intercourse. \n* Begin pregnancy at a healthy weight.\n* Avoid alcohol,smoking and caffeine which can negatively affect fertility. \n* Eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables,vitamins and drink purified water.\n* Use over-the-counter tests that help screen for key elements either male or female fertility.<p>Pregnant women who are classified as having advanced maternal age are not sick, this is not a disease,so do not get alarmed,just do your best to have a healthy life style to ensure a healthy pregnancy.<p>Despite these grim statistics,not everyone will have trouble getting pregnant after 35.However,if you are having trouble,and youre older than 35,you shouldn't try on your own for longer than six months.
