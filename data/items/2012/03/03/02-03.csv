As soon as the movie started I thought ""Yep, here we go. 110 minutes of pure army PR"".<p>What I thought was more interesting were the comments on the reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. You can check them out for yourself here: <a href=""http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/act_of_valor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/act_of_valor/</a>\nIt is a shit movie; no doubt about it. What I find interesting are the comments on the reviews that the critics gave.<p>Critics of course correctly pointed out how this movie is basically an advertisement paid for by the Navy. However, any critic that dared to give a bad review or even mention the word ""propaganda"" was attacked by countless posters that were shouting how he is a ""damned liberal"" and how the soldiers ""die for [him] everyday to protect [his] freedom"".<p>I do not understand the glorification of soldiers and I probably never will. War is a horrible, horrible thing. Soldiers are professional killers. As Voltaire said: ""All murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets""<p>There is no glory or honor in war (more specifically the current situation in Afghanistan/Iraq). The soldier sure as hell did not die for you. He most likely died protecting his comrades that he has been living with for the last 4 years. The soldier probably doesn't even give a shit about you. The Army is not defending America's ""way of life"". Terrorists do not hate you because of your ""freedoms"".\nAs a Canadian, I really don't understand why my opinion is so frowned upon in the US.",1330742600

They all do it for money, or because of a sense of obligation/love.<p>But, there are a few other <i>big</i> differences between waging war and providing social services.<p>Perhaps the biggest is that a particular war is a one-time, no-easy-turning-back event, that generally provides little direct benefit to the population funding it. By way of contrast, I'm <i>not</i> saying that civil defense should in general go unfunded.<p>I'm saying that a single massive expenditure of blood and treasure, which will almost certainly result in the violent deaths of tens or hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children, should probably need to meet a somewhat higher bar than the requirement and funding of compulsory high school. Whenever many extra innocent people are likely to die prematurely, extra scrutiny of the decision-making process is required.<p>Because it is precisely when people are asked to pay for something that they seriously evaluate whether it is worth the expense -- and this is a calculation that <i>needs</i> to be made for war more so than for anything else. In general, I think most populations are more than willing to spend what's necessary to defend themselves from a large, immediate threat -- there was little trouble in getting people to pay extra taxes for WWII.<p>Also, because of its one-time nature, the cost of the war could easily come at the expense of other services. In general, people have consented to paying for social services (yes, in the long run they'll cause America to run a deficit if nothing changes, but for now it's being paid for with tax dollars).",1330742005
