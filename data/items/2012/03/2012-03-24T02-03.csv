3748324,story,,,11,13,Deception12,"Is college really worth it if your goals are to become a web developer?",,"	I am a high school student and I am currently trying to decide where to go to college, or if I should go to college at all. Over the past 2 years I have found software development to be something that I really enjoy doing. The problem is I do not have much experience as a programmer currently. Now the traditional route would be to go to college, and use the degree to sell myself along with the skills I have learned throughout college. However, I have talked to numerous people, owners of tech companies that say the degree itself is basically useless. Most if not all of them would say they would rather hire someone with experience that knows how to program, than someone with a degree that says ""hire me, I have a good education"".
I found a local school that offers a degree in software engineering, which would be much more relevant than lets say, computer science. It might be a good safety net as well. I think college, if anything, is simply something that reassures you that you will have a decent paying job when you get out. Spending 4 years at a university though is not only expensive, but over 4 years, technology changes. If I learn a hot language while in college, by the time I get out and look for a job with it, it will be outdated. Why not take advantage of it right away? While college may provide a good safety net and give you a framework to work off of, is it really the right choice for a software engineer?<p>There are quite a few alternatives that I feel could lead to even better job opportunities. Quite a few websites provide the resources to completely learn everything you need to know about programming for a small price. When compared to a college education that puts you $60,000 in debt, it looks like a simple choice to learn it yourself. Also, there are quite a few ""programming/developer camps"" (Dev Bootcamp/Code Academy) that are basically a few months long sessions, where you learn to program in a specific language in a very short period of time. All of the camps I have looked at are in the LA/San Francisco/New York areas. Basically they are all intense, but you walk out knowing that you have a really good foundation in a programming language or two, and also you are in high demand if you know your stuff. The great thing about this is the networking, most of them have employers that come to the programs towards the end, and there are many guest speakers from tech companies during the program. My thinking is, if I can land even a lower end programming + development position right after the program, I could take courses at a local college on weekends/nights. After four years of that (when all of my friends who go to college graduate). I will have 4 years of programming experience, probably will have had at least 2 jobs, had some experience with college courses, and best of all I will have absolutely 0 debt.<p>So my question is for all the programmers and developers out there, anyone in the tech industry, or anyone who works with hiring of programmers and developers. Is college worth it? Is going to one of these camps and working on a portfolio to demonstrate your skills a better choice? Or is it best to try to learn it all on your own?",1332557986

3748293,comment,3744841,3746949,3,0,Retric,,,"Your thinking of a basic classifier Neural net from an AI class.  But, that's a poor analogy for anything more complex than reflexes.  We have both short and long term memory, and we can do planning.  A really simple way to thank about short term memory is to have a single neuron in a feed back loop.  Basically it's output leads to it's input and it can be switched on and off.  Of course real neurons have far more than just 3 connections and tend to work in fairly large networks, but it's gives you an idea of how you can have a short term memory you keep cycling though the lyrics of some song and it's 'stuck in your head'.<p>Long term memory is a physical change in the layout of a neural network.  Spend long enough walking around a new city and there is an abstract but physical map that's actually stored in the layout of neurons in your head.  At the same time pieces of that layout represent locations on the map and how they connect to other locations.  Think of an entrance to a parking lot and you might have a fairly static picture of the location linked to the choice of where that will take you if you go there.  (So short term memory is now a neuron that cycles, a network that picks which target network to activate, and a network that represents something, plus feedback to turn on and off the targeting.)<p>So what's consciousness? It's the ability to think about things as abstractions.  When you say Apple to your self your actually activating neurons that keep cycling <i>Apple</i> over and over.  Picture yourself tossing a ball and your thinking thinking about starting the cascade of muscle memory that causes you to through something while picking the perimeters of where you want the ball to end up and how hard you want to to hit the target, and possibly the position you need to be in to actually be able to through the ball.  You can play around with the outcomes of if I do this that will happen by checking what neural net's predict the outcome will be.  Chess is a great analogy for this, players don't think about moves as picking a piece up and moving it somewhere else, but what it means when the piece is in a new location.  Though experience, education, or just thinking about things you can even train these neural networks to get better at those predictions.<p>Of course the actual implementation of these things is horribly complex, and many of the specifics are not all completely understood / studied.  Also, chemicals play a major role, there are actual chemicals that represent things like pleasure in the brain.  EX: Cocaine mimics the mostly hard coded chemical reward response for things like having sex by blocking the dopamine reuptake transporters. <a href=""http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1704"" rel=""nofollow"">http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/exchange/node/1704</a><p>PS: Still I hope this simplified model helps you understand what's going on.",1332556791

Sales guys sell everything, even if it's  not in the wheelhouse of the company. Software guys add features that they should probably have the courage to say no to. Musicians over-do their music (ie trying to show off). So that's the anti-pattern; people realize that sometimes saying no is better than the alleged best practice of always finding a way to say yes.<p>I will admit I certainly could've worded things better, but I was writing from my phone and that tends to decrease my willingness to craft better comments.<p>That said, the book ""Getting to Yes"" which is the inspiration for the article's title isn't at all about always saying yes. It's about principled negotiation. It is an amazing book; there's a reason it's standard fare in the MBA world. I would argue that someone practicing principled negotiation would say no in the situation of the article as well; in that sense the articles title is kinda just a cheesy headline (but still nice, it made me click on it).",1332555916

It is rare that I can get past page 2 of the /newest listings before getting the Expired link notification, so, I probably miss quite a few submissions.<p>Basically, the link code that you see is a closure that contains the results for your particular view of the articles. In that snapshot in time, your list remains 'constant' until you refresh it with a few to /newest or / allowing pagination to work consistently as you move through the list. When you get the expired link notification, it means that your closure has been removed due to GC or a server restart.<p>Each time a story is voted on, the global pool is updated, but, until your closure is recreated, you would not see the effect of the vote. Therefore, the shuffling you would see when you or others upvote a story that might change pagination won't affect you.<p>I believe the top 1000 is separate from the normal operation of the site and is run 'at some interval'. I don't recall, but I don't think it is recalculated frequently.<p>Ranking is a function of vote velocity over time. A story that gets a rapid number of upvotes will get pushed up higher than one that has a lot of upvotes, but was submitted hours ago. i.e. 100 votes in the last 20 minutes will be pushed above 140 upvotes in the last 60 minutes.<p>I'm in the middle of some code, but, if I get a chance this weekend, I'll take a look.
