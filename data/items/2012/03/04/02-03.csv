3661794,comment,3660718,3661191,2,0,mietek,,,"Fred Brooks writes in ""The Mythical Man-Month"":<p>""Programming managers have long recognized wide productivity variations between good programmers and poor ones. But the actual measured magnitudes have astounded all of us. In one of their studies, Sackman, Erikson, and Grant were measuring performances of a group of experienced programmers. Within just this group the ratios between best and worst performances averaged about 10:1 on productivity measurements and an amazing 5:1 on program speed and space measurements! In short the $20,000/year programmer may well be 10 times as productive as the $10,000/year one. The converse may be true, too. The data showed no correlation whatsoever between experience and performance. (I doubt if that is universally true.)""",1330829885

3661788,comment,3661731,3661731,10,0,rsanchez1,,,"Anyone who has insurance doesn't care about the price. They only care about the deductible. When people shop around, they look for the insurance companies that provide the lowest deductibles and stick with them. After that, there's no pressure on the providers to lower prices. The insurance companies in the US don't negotiate lower prices, they just pass on the cost to policy holders in their deductibles. The providers can increase the price without fearing that patients will go to a different clinic or buy a different generic version of their drug. Medical care in the US is one of the only industries where raising the price can get your more customers, since it makes the government push for universal health insurance to keep deductibles low.<p>There are a few solutions, two of which were mentioned in the article. The insurance companies can negotiate prices with providers, or the government can set the price. A third option is to let the patients themselves set the price by having them shop around. The patients would put pressures on the providers by going where they can get the cheapest MRI or the cheapest Lipitor. Then insurance would be reserved for emergency procedures, instead of being used as a medical credit card.",1330829681

I'm just back from a run, and can't reply in depth right now, but wanted to add this comment as a placeholder before the thread falls off your radar. Will update here within a few hours.<p>(And, PS, thanks for the kind words.)<p>[Update follows]<p>I don't think we've ever claimed that before Stripe you had to have a merchant account. We're of course aware that there were a a bunch of services that didn't require a merchant account before Stripe (not just PayPal, but also Google Checkout and Amazon Payments).<p>The point we always do try to make is that the vast majority of sites (and, especially, the <i>best</i> sites) end up using their own merchant account. Whatever about the feature sets of PayPal and similar systems, people still ended up preferring merchant accounts, and the traditional merchant account infrastructure powers most of the e-commerce on the web.<p>It turns out that there are actually pretty good reasons for this: the merchant-account based solutions gave you the most control over the end-user experience, the most control over the relationship with your customers, and so on. Merchant accounts were the best solution and still are the most widely deployed option.<p>To the extent that Stripe is competing with anything, we're competing with <i>that</i>.<p>And so, to get back to your point: it is, overall, a pretty subtle situation, and how best to make the landscape clear in a few sentences to someone watching TV -- or someone who doesn't know much about the industry -- isn't easy. We want to be as accurate as possible without compromising clarity or brevity.

E-mail harvesters usually discard it, but a user who clicks the link (e.g. to compose a message in Thunderbird) will have their subject field populated.<p>Now set up procmail to redirect messages to /dev/null if the passphrase is not present.  Now you can freely post the uri all over the web.<p>Real example:<p>mailto:aoxomoxoa@finnw.me.uk?subject=Don%22t+buy+this<p>(I'm confident that no spammer will send bulk messages with ""Don't buy this"" in the subject line, so that makes a good default passphrase.)",1330826750
