All the kid knows is that his dad didn't care enough to stay in his life and doesn't want to take care of him.<p>I do think it is unfair, in a ""life isn't fair"" way not a ""they shouldn't have to pay"" way, when the child was the accidental product and the father is on the hook.

3774435,comment,3774113,3774113,2,0,apinstein,,,"I remember thinking during class at business school (1992-1996) that the internet was going to cause a major shift in retail. To survive in the internet age, retail would need to morph into basically a manufacturer showroom, with very knowledgeable staff and where most goods were ordered in-store or online and just drop-shipped.<p>Why? Because the retail industry had devolved into essentially a real estate business; manufacturers bought shelf space from retailers. Manufacturers had essentially no control over the person-to-person sales/education experience for their own goods. Manufacturers hated it, especially new entrants, since it was so hard to introduce a new and actually better product.<p>It's taken about 20 years, but this is finally starting to happen at scale. Companies like Sony and Dell tried it, but they didn't really invest in the right floor salespeople or retail experience to make it anything other than a Sony store vs a Best Buy. Apple is really the first company to nail it, and it's paying off big time. It is really cool to see, as I think it's such a move in the right direction for both manufacturers and customers.",1333079824

3774395,comment,3774113,3774113,0,0,rodly,,,"This is an interesting example of how disruptive technology is. E-commerce is just too powerful a force and the low costs and ease of use will soon demolish our conceptions of what a retail store should be. With rising gas prices, no one wants to drive to a store, spend time searching for products, and be subject to annoying taxes and price hikes that B&M need to have to profit. It's an interesting but scary proposition because as more stores close down and jobs are displaced to programmers/web developers/etc, you get a pool of uneducated workers who saturate the employment pool with good work experience. This leads to lower and lower wages due to obvious excess supply and, well, you know how that goes. This is truly a scary transition that will become more commonplace in the coming years. There will be an uptick in jobs for people like us, but most people, even college students now, have no idea how to do much more than load memes in a ""internet explorer thingy firefox"". An even scarier question is when will E-commerce no longer need an abundance of highly paid programmers to build their infrastructure? I fear Amazon has nailed the proper way to shop online and their template is just that, a template. Wordpress killed the idea of a unique blog. Everyone can have a wonderful looking site and have no clue how anything works. When everyone can be extraordinary and stand out, no one stands out.",1333079006

I have a BA in another field, have been an entrepreneur since my mid-20s and am now a self-taught programmer. I generally don't contract or work full time for other people. But I would like to get a CS degree for personal growth. I can't really justify it being too disruptive so it would have to be:<p>1) Flexible.\n2) Not terribly expensive.<p>Currently ""questionable"" accreditation would be ok since I think people's opinion of online schooling is likely to change dramatically over the next decade.<p>What I'm looking for is an extended CS-related challenge with some manner of official closure at the end. For my own personal satisfaction I would like to say I finished a second degree as opposed to saying I finished some free MIT courses online.<p>Anything worthwhile available out there?",1333078513

Until people get burned, they don't realize that what you can get for $1500 on elance.com will, when it fails, end up costing you more than what you'd get for $15k from a skilled developer.

They would do this even if there was already a Best Buy within a few miles of that location.<p>Now that Circuit City is gone, Best Buy is left with quite a few stores that really have no reason to exist--they are too close to another Best Buy. These are a major contribution to the list of stores they are closing.<p>Closing these stores is not necessarily a sign of trouble.",1333076419
