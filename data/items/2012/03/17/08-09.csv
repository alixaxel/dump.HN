You just don't ask.<p>These sorts of things were happening in the Stalinist ""dark"" '50s, that's for sure, but when I grew up, in the '80s, the regime had become a little bit more ""civilized"". I think it was mostly because Ceausescu had signed the Helsinki Accords (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Accords"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki_Accords</a>) and in general because he wanted to detach Romania from Moscow's grip. The regime wasn't technically allowed, so to speak, to imprison people for political reasons, so this is why the authorities were resorting to either fake psychiatric assessments or to made up petty theft charges in order to take away ""inconvenient"" people.<p>Anyway, it's a very long and complicated story, 20 years after the facts even us, Romanians, don't have a single view on the whole thing (surprisingly enough, there's a quite big percentage of the population who'd rather relive those times than having to deal with the realities of the present).",1331974784

Which is to say, the poor are taxed disproportionately compared to the rich.<p>A person who makes $10M a year spends a <i>much</i> lower percentage of his income than someone who makes $40K a year. So now we're taxing the $40K person heavily, while the $10M person pays comparatively almost nothing, even accounting for lavish and expensive lifestyles.<p>It reinforces a negative cycle - the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and social mobility is removed. When the poor lose all hope of improving their lot because the system is so stacked against them, instability and unrest results and... well, the rest of this story might get a little violent.<p>This is probably a worse idea than, say, the flat-rate income tax that is practiced in Hong Kong and elsewhere.",1331973617

3716651,comment,3716267,3716602,3,0,tzs,,,"> This reminds me of Record/Movie industries' ""belief"" that piracy robs them of billions of revenue. No. If some magical perfect anti-piracy field was in place the vast majority of people not paying for your crap would still be not paying for your crap. That money doesn't exist<p>The record and movie industries are indeed wrong in their belief that every pirated copy represents a lost sale, but you are erring in the other direction.<p>First, aside from people who are pirating a movie they don't know much about to try it out, generally people aren't pirating movies that they think are crap. It wastes their time, and if they have a bandwidth cap wastes their limited bandwidth.<p>Second, most pirates, at least in the developed world, do have discretionary money for entertainment and other luxuries. If they could not pirate movies, the would most likely not give them up. They would reallocate their discretionary entertainment money so that they could get some movies.<p>If a perfect anti-piracy technology were deployed, there would be two competing effects.<p>1. Many people would reallocate discretionary spending. The movie industry would gain. Restaurants, game companies, book publishers, fashion, and such would lose.<p>2. Piracy can serve to raise awareness of a movie, which increases demand among non-pirates. If piracy were stopped, the movie industry might have to raise advertising spends.",1331972725

There's little to no value upside over the next five years (value, not price; value being what you get, price being what you pay), short of a stock market bubble spiking everything.<p>It's not surprising FB would get a $100b valuation though. Investors are desperate for growth.<p>Compression is a word FB investors should get used to. Facebook will spend years growing into that valuation, much like other tech stocks in a similar outsized valuation situation.<p>Google for example has returned a weak 6% per year for the last five years. Not much greater than the dividend that Verizon and AT&T pay. eBay has spent a decade growing into their crazy dotcom days valuation, and now sport a very modest 15x pe ratio.<p>At $8 billion in sales, FB can generate $3 billion in net income. Their model scales extremely well in terms of margins and expenses per extra dollar of sales/profit.<p>At $3 billion in net income, they'd have a 33 pe ratio. They can absolutely hold a valuation around those levels three years out. This is assuming their sales growth continues to slow. However, point being, there's no value upside left in the stock.",1331972535

Search engine marketing works because the person has already expressed their interests (and therefore segmented themselves very precisely) by typing in a search query. Retargeted ads are also effective because you are targeting the valuable segment of ""people who have visiting your site"".<p>Facebook, on the other hand, allows to define a random person really precisely. Not only on their demographics but also which web pages they liked, what their friends like etc etc.<p>This could extend to any ads. Banners obviously, but also TV ads shown on streaming programs.
