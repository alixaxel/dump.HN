I know it is all the rage these days, but it is an accessibility issue for me (and probably others as well). I use highlighting to make it easier for me to read text (it helps by eyes track better).

At first, I must be ugly and a social outcast (they referred to me as ""the burly Russian wrestler""). I shrugged it off, because everyone got shit. So what? Then I went to one of the parties; very few people there had met me before. I was a pretty standard looking 16 year old girl, but I felt like meat, just meat.

I thought about all the problems I encounter in order to think of a new product idea, and this is what I have so far.<p>I'm a subscriber to GQ Magazine because it makes clothes shopping a little simpler. I've found that the style of clothing they market is impeccable, but all of the clothing is extremely expensive.  I've talked to other subscribers who said they try to match what they see in the magazine to clothes they shop for at places like H&M, Express, etc.<p>My idea relieves this hassle: provide an electronic version of GQ's clothing section for people who can't afford $800 ties. I would follow a similar format GQ has: model new styles with information on where the consumer can purchase with the price. The clothes would instead be from more affordable retailers and possibly have a more casual feel than the mostly-formal GQ theme.<p>My issue with this idea is the business model. Right now I would rely on advertising revenue from clothing companies and other businesses who want to reach this market. Is this too risky of a business model for a student start-up?<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated and will help me get into my school's incubator.",1332813033

Nowadays a kid is not going to impress a friend with that.  Remember that positive feedback is very reinforcing.  On the other hand having an Android app that asks your name in a gui and gives a gui response is so much more familiar.  App Inventor has media players, camera recording etc which is so much more modern and expressive.  I'd much rather see her making an app where you record yourself saying your name, and then it says ""hello $name"" with your recording and text to speech.<p>> With an open access graphics subsystem, a modest ARM core CPU, some memory, and USB plugs for ""disks"" and ""keyboards""<p>That just won't work.

Maybe Google+ isn't designed to supplant Facebook, and maybe it shouldn't be, but it's hard to argue that it wasn't designed at least with Facebook in mind. Like it or not, Facebook directly stores and controls a tremendously large chunk of the data in the world, and to top it off it is arguable that it is this data is most important to people personally, since they spend so much more time with it than they do with, say, Wikipedia. Regardless of whether G+ is a direct Facebook competitor or not, this chunk of information is also off-limits to Google, and the result is that Facebook as an entity poses an existential threat to the entire company, whose job is expressly to make information accessible and searchable. Search isn't going anywhere, but if the most important information is locked away by Zuckerberg and Company, then it may also not be going anywhere especially interesting.<p>In spite of what I just said, I will grant that you're right when you say that Google+ isn't Facebook. The comparison is almost certain to be unflattering to Google+, and it misses something essential.

The ability to share blog-style posts in a more freely social setting has catapulted the site to popularity among a nontrivial portion of <i>very</i> prominent academics, not to mention the very influential tech people who use it. Facebook was the minority when it launched to ivy league schools, but one key to their success was that they had the attention of the right people. Google may not be popular, but that doesn't mean they're wrong. Time will tell what happens from here on out, but it will be ironic if the prominent hackers who jump ship because Google is changing ended up jumping ship so that a new set of hackers could build something cool in their place.<p>While I ended up agreeing with a lot of the points of the original TC article, I think your conclusion ended up being more right, and it is truly unfortunate that Google+ does not get defended as it probably should.",1332812416

3759502,comment,3755418,3756405,2,0,Lazare,,,"I think the problem here is that ""exploitation"" is very poorly defined.  It's widely used concept, and most people have an <i>intuitive</i> sense of what the word means, but these definitions conflict.<p>Let's step back a moment:  Let's say person A has a widget, which he values at $5.  Person has $20, and would like a widget, which he values at $10.  In a free market we would expect these people to negotiate and reach an agreement where A swaps the widget with B in exchange for between $5.01 and $9.99 of cash.  The aggregate benefit of the transaction is $5 (that is, as a society, we are $5 better off after this transaction is made), and A and B are each somewhere between $0.01 and $4.99 better off.<p>In this simple model, clearly both sides are benefiting, or if you prefer, are being enriched.  Question:  Is anyone being exploited?  Does it depend on the price?  Or do we need to know more details about the transaction, and if so, what?<p>I think most people intuitively have one of two reactions:<p>1) ""Unless fraud or force is being used, of course nobody is being exploited.  Both sides enter into the transaction with open eyes, and both sides benefit.  They can negotiate however they want to divy up the $5 in benefit - but as long as fraud or force aren't used, this can't be exploitation.""<p>2) ""Well, we need to know more.  If one side has a lot more power than the other, they might drive the price unfairly far to one side or the other.  If A is a large factory churning out widgets, a price of $5.10 might be a perfectly reasonable wholesale price; if A is peasant hand-crafting widgets and B is a multi-national widget trader, maybe anything less than $6 may represent the unfair exploitation of A.  Conversely, a price of $9.90 might be fine if B is a collector of rare widgets, but even $8 might be exploitive if B is desperately trying to find a widget to repair his generator after an earthquake.  We just can't know.""<p>I don't think either response is inherently more correct - both definitions are valid.  But, obviously, they conflict.  :)  Also, in my experience people rarely, if ever, will change their initial intuition.  Either you think exploitation is only the result of fraud or force (ie, using slave labour to produce widgets), or you think exploitation is involved in any transaction with a price that seems ""unfair"" (to you, based on fuzzy and usually undefined metrics).<p>As a result, I'm not sure discussions of exploitation really make a lot of sense.  Given the same objective and universally agreed facts about, e.g., Foxconn, a certain chunk of the population will say ""that's obviously not exploitation"" and a certain chunk will say ""that's clearly exploitation"", despite there being no real disagreement about what's actually taking place on the ground.",1332811564

Generally speaking, it's extremely difficult to independently come up with the same exact text as someone else for anything nontrivial in length.<p>The problem with patents is that two people can (and do) come up with the same idea completely independently and that many of those ideas are completely obvious (eg I remember seeing an early GPU trademark that related to applying 2 or more textures to a pixel in a cycle instead of 1).<p>I can write a computer program and it will quite possibly violate any number of patents.

Yea i realize that most you tube comments are relatively worthless but I do tend to speed through them to get a feel for what the response is to a particular video.  Inevitably I get through 20 comments and then the same 20 are repeated over again, often they are repeated several times.  Perhaps they are trying to give the illusion of lots of comments or assuming the comments don't matter.

Every other layer- wiring, circuit design, device engineering, physics, and so on- are no less valid, but you probably can't do all of them.
