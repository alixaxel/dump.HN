It's usually a very minimal movement, and I find it a lot easier (and less straining) than moving the pinky to press control. The only drawback is that it doesn't really work on a laptop keyboard.<p>I picked that up a few years back playing World of Warcraft and some other games, to avoid having to move my left hand away from WASD as much as possible, but it has served me very well in a lot of other applications since then.<p>Edit: Well, that was supposed to be an answer to cheatercheater below this comment.

3686667,story,,,3,6,spung,"Trademark Woes",,"Hey HN, just wanted to vent and share our recent experiences lately with trademarking.<p>We had a very relevant and favorable name for our startup. We've purchased the domain name, built the technology, worked on design and marketing/messaging, and purchased business cards. Only months later after all that work and talking to customers and mentors to develop our product did we start the process to trademark our name. We're fortunate to have access to a trademark attorney, who told us that our name has a big chance conflicting with another trademark recently granted which lists what seems like every internet software good and service under the sun, only a few letters off but pronounced very similarly. Overall, we're fortunate to not have incorporated yet, but I think it's more the attachment to the name and the time spent developing our messaging that's got us down.<p>After getting over the initial stage of feeling bummed we have to abandon that relevant name, we spent a week brainstorming new names that sounded unique, domain was available, and a uspto.gov search turned up no concerning results. We narrowed it down to a few favorites, and decided on our favorite one. We were so excited around this new name, started brainstorming how we could leverage a play on the name for marketing, design, and focusing the company around a cool character mascot we began sketching. Spoke to the trademark attorney today and he found another trademark with goods and services described as a desktop CMS application and selling prerecorded video/audio recordings for lessons in marketing. At first we said no, that's so different from what we're doing! But then he showed us a similar application for a different spelling of the name we wanted, along with the letter for rejection by the trademark office, which explained:<p>The goods and/or services of the parties need not be identical or directly competitive to find a likelihood of confusion. Rather, they need only be related in some manner, or the conditions surrounding their marketing are such that they would be encountered by the same purchasers under circumstances that would give rise to the mistaken belief that the goods and/or services come from a common source.<p>Now we're back to square one. We're thinking for this round we need to brainstorm names that are obscure, possibly in a different language, or a word that means nothing at all.<p>Does anyone have any similar stories or advice to share? Going through this frustrating process, I'm surprised any startup is able to choose any name with common words in them. Do many companies just go with a name once they secure the domain and hope for the best?<p>Thanks for any feedback.",1331341171

It was cool at launch, and true there are some areas where it's legitimately superior to FB and Twitter, but overall it's only marginally better at best, not enough to get most people to switch.<p>Worse, since launch they don't seem to have rolled out many improvements, despite the clamor among its users for solutions to various problems.<p><i>> Asked about what Google+ actually is, Gundotra answered that, at its simplest, it is a social layer across all of Google's services. For Gundotra, what was missing on Google before Google+ was its ability to really understand its users and their connections. The challenge, in Gundotra's view, is that most people don't actually quite understand this.</i><p>Actually, people don't care.  They're not using G+ in order to help Google understand them and their connections, they're using it to connect, learn, grow, and enjoy themselves.  But as good as the idea of circles is, there are still shortcomings in the service that impede this, and which Google hasn't addressed (hopefully they're in the process of learning from their copious amounts user feedback and fixing it all, but no idea what's going on behind the scenes).<p><i>> The general feeling one got from watching Gundotra was that in his view, those who don't quite get Google+ are probably not using it right and not looking at it in the right way.</i><p>That's unfortunate.  The right way is what is natural, intuitive, and emergent.  If Google didn't quite predict all of that exactly, G+ needs to adapt, not the other way around.  Again, maybe they're doing exactly that behind the scenes, and just aren't done yet.  I hope so, it's a great service with a lot of potential if they can just nail the remaining issues.<p><i>> As for a full read/write API that would give developers access to the stream and allow them to post to it, Gundotra noted that he doesn't quite want to do it yet. In his view, just opening up an API would pollute the stream.</i><p>I grok his concerns, but what they really need to do is provide the tools for users to micro-manage their own streams.  Hashtag filtering for circles would be a <i>huge</i> step in that direction, and give users complete granular control over what they see and from whom.  For example, if I want to see Sergey Brin's posts on computer science but not his skydiving vacations or pictures of dinner, hashtag filtering on my CS circle would facilitate that.<p>Side note - amusing article in the sidebar: <i>""Study: Two-Thirds of Search Engine Users Dont Want Personalized Results""</i>.

However, due to the requirements of a separate filesystem for USB Mass Storage, they partitioned the internal storage into two.<p>Then you get the Galaxy Nexus, with only one partition. It features Ice Cream Sandwich, with MTP (Mass Transport Protocol). MTP allows access to a filesystem without unmounting it, so the phone can continue to use the filesystem.

3686597,comment,3683681,3684786,2,0,codemonkeyland,,,"I think he's simply stating what has made many Java programmers very cynical about frameworks such as these. Java EE layers abstraction on top of abstraction. App servers like WebSphere use a ton of memory before you've even deployed your app to the server and they charge you an arm and a leg (yes I know glassfish and jboss are free). Java code is verbose and ill-suited to crafting systems which generate html. The Java enterprise camp was championing the idea that web applications should have JSP talking to session beans, which talk to entity beans which then talks to your actual data store. By the time you've coded it all up you realise that it's slow before you've even added any business logic. Things have improved since then, but they lost my trust a long time ago. Spring seems to love having programmers take java source and translating it into XML so it's much more verbose than java (quite a feat in itself) and hides some of the most critical code from the IDE. The ""benefits"" provided by such approaches are marginal at best. The ironic part... I'm a huge fan of Java the platform, just despise the culture of bloatware which has sprung up around it. The world is moving on to lightweight solutions which don't require app servers which generate stack traces so long that they span 3 screens.",1331338969

Well thank you so much, what I already knew is what I was NOT looking for. I'll use Google+'s search if I want to find a post on Google+.<p>Also I may be the exception, but ever since I tried DuckDuckGo I liked it more and more.

It just works great for most things I search for.<p>Social search... yeah many things have been said about it, but a classic example is the restaurant. Wouldn't you want to get restaurants near you, rather than one in Iran (let's pretend that is a top ranking one)?\nWell, no, absolutely not. If I want a restaurant nearby, I'll open up Google Maps on my phone, zoom to the range I want to search within, and search for 'restaurant'. Or if I can't do that, I'll simply Google for 'restaurant city-name'.\nThis localization is also rendered useless when you want to find a restaurant to take your girlfriend to and you are not whereever you would like to take her.\nOh and don't forget that Google can't really find the location of most desktop computers, it will only work on laptops and mobile devices when they share their location.<p>The only possible benefit I can see from this is that you don't have to type the city name when you mean the city you're currently at.
