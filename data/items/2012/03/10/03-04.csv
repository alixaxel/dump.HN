More specifically: Is it possible, by providing better tools for publishing and accessing information, to substantially improve public policy debates? Can we reduce the very large rewards for dishonesty and the use of disinformation?<p>This is the crux of the problem with our current political system, I think. It's not campaign finance, it's not religion, it's not disagreements about economics, foreign policy, security vs liberty (a lovely false dichotomy) or what have you. It is simply the fact that lies win and truth loses. Or, if that statement is not necessarily true, it is true in the current practice.<p>So, if you buy my premise, how can technology help? Isn't it a problem of human nature? You can't force people to be honest. You also can't force people to learn how to recognize dishonesty in spheres where they have not much competence. You can't impose good sense or decency.<p>But human nature is varied, and so maybe the seeming ascendancy of its more unfortunate aspects is situational. Maybe by improving the context and presentation of information they can be mitigated. Maybe technology can be used to recognize and reward honesty and to point out and discourage dishonesty. It hurts to think about, doesn't it? It does for me, because it is so hard, and that's what I took from pg essay. Granted, I may not be talking about problems to solve which would make you the next Google.<p>As an aside, I think that the utility of greater transparency of public actions (governmental or corporate) is already well-understood by many and much work is already being done in this direction so I am leaving out.

You've become so dogmatic, so preachy, and so full of immutable opinions and religious stances on how the ""community"" should behave, down to the most micro of behaviors, all while saying that the community owns the process and makes the decisions, while at the same time expressing intolerance for those who do not see things your way.  You talk at people, not to people.  Ironically some of these attributes are what made SO so successful.  You've also become arrogant.  I've heard you on numerous podcasts where you spend the first 5 minutes telling the interviewers what you will <i>not</i> talk about.  Who are you?  You should be happy you're getting attention.  And on your blog, which you built over so much time with so much effort and with which cultivated your huge audience, you've become absent.  The guy who is all about the community hasn't participated in a discussion in your blog comments in quite some time.  You just can't have it both ways.  Additionally, you lived so deep in the weeds of SO user behaviors and in the intricate meta details of how the site works that you lost sight of the bigger picture.  You became so meta that the metas had metas that had metas.

I'd like to see an 'app-store' translation for drama as well, but it seems like tv / movies are not as amateur friendly to create as games.  One person can develop a fun indie game, but it's nigh on impossible to create drama with a similarly small budget.<p>What aspiring drama writers / directors need are tools equivalent to game level editors to create their scenes without actors, cameras or studios. Packaged believable human CG characters may not be possible, but cartoon, animal, alien, etc. characters might be able to bridge the gap the way they do in video games and still tell a compelling story.",1331349789
