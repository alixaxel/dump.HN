I would say you made the right choice to keep working for that extra 6 months post-burnout, because post-burnout takes minimally 2 years to recover from if you're going to recover at all. For you it took 3, I would bet those extra 6 months factored in, but I'm assuming you didn't have to worry about finances so much during those three years so it may have been a good tradeoff.<p>I second the advice to uncover the causes that are pushing toward burnout, because if they are left to fester then burnout becomes inevitable and post-burnout recovery takes even longer. Exercising more isn't going to fix it. A week vacation isn't going to fix it, a month vacation isn't going to fix it, because when the vacation is over nothing will have changed.

I fully support the men who will help call out this kind of behaviour, and am also fully satisfied that this issue has front-paged HN for as long as it has.<p>From my own experience of work, cultural norms and popular issues, although only the smallest of samples, I'd say that (younger) Swedes have a much better handle on the balance of respect and gender roles than their peers in FR or the UK (England, specifically). Even the most subtle attempt at sexism is picked up on to a degree where it is unacceptable to at least publicly chance a remark of this kind in the workplace or in the media. Why this is I can only guess.<p>Prevalent (older) attitudes may account for the continued pay discrepancy between men and women and all that this reflects, but I'd say the Swedes have a very much less subtly-offensive 'working atmosphere' than those I've been part of elsewhere.<p>Also troubling is the question of 'women/babies/employment', but that's a whole other can of worms; just as a parting shot - men also leave poorly managed jobs when something better in life is offered to them, at least you get up to 9 months warning with women.",1332412000

Try to deceive them with BS!<p>A lot of people are not so lucky though to work with them. A company have a soul and a culture.

They would need to have a separate range of anycast IPs for every possible combination of regions (2^N possibilities) to prevent packets from going into a black hole. If they wanted to be able to serve a conservative number of hosts in every region (say 32768) that would require 15-bits of IP space per combination. If AWS expands to 10 regions, that means 25-bits of the IPv4 space. A /8 only gives you 24.<p>I guess an alternative might be to do some kind of NAT for unbound anycast addresses which forwards packets to an available region, but that is hugely complicated.",1332410529
