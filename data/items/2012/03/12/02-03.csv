I'm not sure how H1B works in the U.S., but a lot of countries have rules like that attached to work visas. So until your visa has been transferred to your startup, your startup can't pay you any salary.",1331521156

Their activities in California are a case in point. In the last eight years they have spent $10 million on state politics  either in direct contributions to politicians or in spending on ballot initiatives relating to crime and punishment. They have mounted full-scale political campaigns. For instance, the California corrections union has attacked public officials, such as the Los Angeles district attorney, who supported an alternative to the union-favored three-strikes law. Indeed, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy in February of this year noted that the three-strikes law sponsor is the correctional officers union and that is sick! In 1999 the union even successfully opposed a proposal to permit the California attorney general to prosecute brutality in prisons.<p><a href=""http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/43266"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hoover.org/publications/policy-review/article/432...</a>",1331520319

3692110,comment,3690481,3691099,4,0,dkarl,,,"Economic incentives are sandwiched between two other factors.  One is more attractive, and tends to dominate discussion, and the other is more powerful and tends to dominate actual behavior.<p>The more attractive force is morality.  People consciously approach their own behavior in moral terms, and they struggle, occasionally successfully, to defy economic incentives that conflict with their moral values.  This personal focus on morality (even if it is a narcissistic delusion) makes it much more natural to discuss policy in moral terms than it terms of incentives.  I don't think this is helpful for policy discussions.  We should all follow what we think is right, but policy needn't reflect moral consensus.<p>The more powerful force is culture.  Think of all the people in jail for selling drugs who could be living middle class lives if only they had rejected their social identities and social ties to follow economic incentives.  It's hard to imagine more powerful economic incentives than the ones operating in American life today.  If you're a poor kid and you dedicate your life to achieving technical competence in a highly paid profession, the economic elite is ideologically invested in the idea that you should be rewarded with a comfortable, secure upper-class life.  Not only are they eager to see you assume the most economically productive position in life you can, in order to bolster the U.S. economic growth that their investments largely track, but even more importantly, denying you the social position you've earned would undermine the legitimacy of their social position.  And if you shoot for Harvard law or Harvard medicine but fall short, you'll still fall in the upper middle class somewhere.  The incentives couldn't be more clear, but mistrust and cultural ties muddy things up.  The fact that people make many of the most crucial decisions of their lives as ignorant children, or have those decisions made for them by ignorant parents, gives culture a big advantage over incentives.  People don't see incentives with perfect, X-ray vision.  They see them through whatever lens they've been equipped with by their upbringing.<p>The effectiveness of incentives, then, depends on cultural factors.  In the case of corporations and thoroughly bourgeois businesspeople, we underestimate the power of incentives.  In the case of everybody else, we overestimate the power of incentives.  In the case of persuading inner-city youth to dedicate themselves to lucrative (for us as well as them) middle-class lives instead of lives of crime, our failure is less in providing opportunity (aka incentives) than in teaching them to see the opportunity and believe in it so that it becomes possible for them to work towards it.<p>I do believe laws should be seen more as a system of incentives than as enforcers of a privileged morality, but laws should be designed to be effective incentives for the people who live under them, not for homo economicus.",1331519654

The money is relevant, but not the main issue at hand.<p>In these communities, nobody cares about money, because your standing in the community isn't determined by how much money you have, but by <i>how much you have contributed</i>. This is kind of implicit in 4chan users, where it's considered tacky to even claim explicit ownership, because memes are understood to be products of an amorphous community. It's explicit on places like Reddit, where cultural standing is measured as a number.<p>Yes, the author would not be receiving money for this product, but having created the game <i>as himself</i> (as opposed to as, say, a semi-anonymous Newgrounds member) he draws more ire. Contrast the relevant videos: the original Kickstarter video features a single strong personality, a person mediating the experience of the memes in the game, while the response video is relatively anonymous, attempting to minimize the mediation between the viewer and his point. The fact that the response video also calls out other YouTube celebrities who do the same thingi.e. offer mediation and commentary of other content through an explicit personalityshould be incredibly telling.<p>Other comments that say things like, ""I'd be honored to have my content featured in someone's game,"" are missing the point. It's a basic culture clash: the article's author expresses distinct authorship which can be traced to a concrete person (or persona), even if he gets no profit and open-sources the result, while the people who make up the response understand that authorship as contrary to the whole point of communal humor, i.e. memes.
