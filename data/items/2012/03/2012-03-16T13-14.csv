You state that no one has stepped up on Android, however there are a number of decent apps that do exactly what's needed, and Readability have already launched on Android to some success.<p>Android users are often aware that they're missing out, but there is always something to fill that void. As a result, their users have a siege mentality towards their platform and the businesses that ignore them. As Instagram is likely to figure out when they (finally) move to Android arriving late to the Android game could be fatal to the perception of their brand.",1331906382

And thus forcing desktop users to use the crappy metro experience and crippling the desktop experience even further.<p>They need to do something progressive but a touchscreen OS for the desktop is <i>not</i> it imo. I'm sure though that it'll be a blast on a tablet.<p>If they can manage to explain it well to new users and to have 2 different app ecosystems it might just work.

This is just another reason why these 'ISPs' are a bad choice.<p>I live in San Francisco and chose Sonic.net because they don't cap or do any kind of traffic shaping. I did take a hit in my speed (from 20mb to 10mb), but their service is top notch and I feel good about where I put my money every month.  Sonic's also been doing a fiber rollout in some areas north of SF and in one section of the city.<p>I won't ever go back to Comcast. I'm interested to see how this will affect people.

They needed to be bailed out because they took great risks on the INVESTMENT side.  This merger of the investment and commercial side was prohibited by Glass-Steagall.

I have been to the states 3 times, first in 2006 where I flew into JFK and was ""randomly selected"" (woooo, I won!) and then detained for additional questionning for 5 hours.<p>What did they ask me? Name, DoB, place of birth (all info IN MY PASSPORT ALREADY!), fathers/mothers name, address, what job I did, where I was staying. I have no problems them asking me, but it's the way they treat you. I got put in a waiting room, told to sit down and answer these question in an ""application"" form. Having filled this in they just told me to sit down. When I got up to ask what was taking so long, ""Sir, would you please sit unless you are called"". As if the sir makes it polite. Eventually they stamped my passport and I was through.<p>Flash forward to July 2010, first stop Atlanta. Same deal. I'l also been backpacking for 6 months. That raised an eyebrow when he looked through all the stamps. I hadn't gone to any of those ""terrorist"" countries though. I was born in Bangladesh and have in the UK since I was a year old. I did get asked though\n- Did you have any military training before you left?\n- Have you been to country X, Y, Z\n- Why did you go to X, Y, Z. Do you not have a job? How did you get time off?\n- I even got asked why I left Bangladesh. Really?!? I was a year old mate, didn't really have a say in the matter!<p>The last time I went was December 2011. That time was a breeze. Flew into Newark, I was already on the system now (I had a change of passport between first 2 visits). I STILL however got briefly questioned in the queue to the counter, I have no idea why, but colour of skin is the only thing...<p>My brother went to Peru a few years back, he a his girlfriend had a stopover in Miami for a couple hours. Note they were not ""entering"" America, this was a compulsory refuel stop I guess. He gets hauled in, his girlfriend is sitting outside WTF is going on. He misses his flight due to the delay, they barely get him on the next flight but now his girlfriend has no fight since she was not hauled in. The airline to their credit were good, swapped their flights and his girlfriend took his flight and they gave him another flight yet several hours later. The most ignorant part of this though, when questioned ""where were you born"" my brother said ""London, UK"", ""But your passport says Kingston"", ""Yes, Kingston Upon Thames, near London, UK"", ""Well the only Kingston I know if Kingston, Jamaica"".

3713194,comment,3711603,3712603,15,0,drostie,,,"From the article's excitement, I would almost guess that they have a working attack against AES, but that sounds extremely unlikely with the amount of scrutiny AES has received. Still, AES is known to have some very clean algebraic properties, and people have wondered since the AES competition whether those would translate into real attacks -- perhaps the NSA has found a way. At least, the discussions about saving data to decrypt later sounds very suggestive of a break on either Triple DES or AES.<p>But I should say that you wouldn't have to break AES to break HTTPS and read most of the encrypted conversations on the web. In late 2008 a group of academics broke HTTPS by lifting a digital signature from a legitimately-signed document which gave few HTTPS permissions, onto a document which gave them arbitrary permissions. They did this by breaking the MD5 algorithm, and it caused the community to finally excise the last of the MD5 certificates for SHA1 certificates. But the NSA could do the same with the SHA1 algorithm's known weakness, and could then listen in on any man-in-the-middle attack they wanted. How complex is this? Since 2008, we've had an attack which might work in 2^52 operations or so. For the NSA that's approximately nothing. The Cray computer (one which we know the US government has) does roughly 2 petaflops now, or 2^51 operations per second or 2^67 per day. So it's reasonable to believe that, if they move from eavesdropping to active communication, they can already break HTTPS. (There is a risk in this method, however: if someone catches you doing this ""in the wild"", then they might notice and raise a big stink about it.)<p>Their exaflop goal would then be 2^85/year, which would be enough to run publicly-known attacks against Triple DES and perhaps to factor known 1024-bit RSA moduli -- for example the Equifax Root CA is 1024 bit RSA. If you could compromise one of those just once, you could issue  certificates of your own -- and it would be extremely difficult if not impossible to detect the intrusion. So with exaflop computing, they could seriously just spend a couple weeks breaking an RSA-1024 modulus and launch undetectable man-in-the-middle attacks against everyone.<p>It's also likely that they've got more efficient attacks than the public researchers have, since they have access not only to the public research but also to a set of well-paid brilliant minds who work on these problems every day, and have been for quite some time. (It would be nice to have some transparency and know just how far they have gotten, but of course they won't even tell us that. I guess that's a bit of a weird question anyway, like asking, ""in the odd event that you might want to stab the Internet to death, we would like to know: how large is the largest knife you own?"")",1331904767

I don't mean to be harsh but there really is no secret sauce for solving people's problems. Further, you don't 'lose' ownership to an idea that easily because:<p>1. Ideas are extremely personal entities. It is really hard to appreciate someone else's idea as your own. (Especially, if they are 'ground-breaking' as nobody would have seen it before)<p>2. It is insanely hard to actually build something. So, it is extremely unlikely that anyone would just rip your idea off.<p>Now, in case the above does not help answer your questions, let us assume that you do have the 'secret sauce' to be the next Google (in whatever field you are).

MS gamed the system in WA state to avoid paying overtime while still being able to take advantage of hiring contractors instead of salaried employees (this was in the 90s - unsure if the same system is still in place). Meanwhile, chipping away at the higher salaried workers just makes it easier to chip away at the lower salaried workers (e.g. retail workers, restaurant workers).<p>We're all in this together.",1331903582

Got a kindle touch, tried it for a week. It was worse, without a doubt. I tend to read in dim light (indirect lamp), and found that the kindle needed direct light for me to easily read without eyestrain. iPad with very low brightness, or even in reversed accessibility mode is nicer. For me, that is. And, any book or paper with code samples just doesn't work well on a small e-ink screen.",1331903539

I like the YC forums because they're very entrepreneurial and not full of a bunch of whiners.<p>The fact that there are so many negative complaints regarding US border security is more than noteworthy.  The TSA and Immigration are just so way out of control.<p>Overall, I think that this is the result of a lack of consistent and sane policies regarding immigration and border control.  On the one hand, we do relatively little to stop illegal immigration on some of our borders for political reasons.  Then on the other hand, we flail madly in the authoritarian direction by having this massive and unchecked TSA bureaucracy.<p>We really have no idea what we're doing on a national level.  As ineffective and counterproductive as border security and immigration is here, I can bet even without looking at the numbers that it isn't cheap.",1331903500

3713108,comment,3712626,3712754,6,0,kokey,,,"Coming into the UK through Heathrow, as a non-EU citizen, can be quite unpleasant.  It's less so nowadays than before, and it was also highly dependent on where you are coming from and what passport you are carrying and when you are landing.  That said, they tend to warm up the more you seem to know the drill and the more stamps for entry you have in your passport.  For first time visitors the experience can be pretty aweful as they play Jeremy Paxman on you after you've just spent 10 hours on a flight.  That said, if the immigration officer is of an ethnic minority they are usually much nicer.  It's one of the times I don't feel bad for racial stereotyping, when I have a choice of desk after 40 minutes of queuing and aim for the non-white officer.<p>I find the other UK airports to be much friendlier in general, they even say 'please' and 'thank you' and even have a sense of humour.",1331903308
