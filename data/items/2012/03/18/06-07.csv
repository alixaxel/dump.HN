And that's sort of the point - when you hire 1 million low skilled employees you are bound to hire mentally unstable people - the kind that commits suicide over a relationship breakup, an argument, etc. So while it's possible that work conditions ""triggered"" the suicide they likely weren't ""normal"" individuals and it doesn't say much about working conditions at Foxconn - the suicide rate would have to be much higher than the average to claim that Foxconn is a deathtrap in which a normal person would commit suicide.",1332053321

These opinions are my own and based only on the linked article.<p>I took a beating on the SEO blogs for calling SEO a bug a few months ago, but I'm glad the rest of the world is finally realizing that I'm right :)<p>Ultimately, Google is trying to rank you highly for providing the best <i>content</i>; you shouldn't be spending your time trying to figure out how to game Google by making superficial changes to the presentation of your content.  Want to rank better?  Write better!<p>The whole problem is rooted in the fact that Google is a leaky abstraction.  It tries to be an omniscient Sherpa, guiding the wary Web traveler with its infinite understanding of the Web and the individual user's needs.  The reality, though, is that Google is actually just a computer program.  So there is a gap between the user's mental model of Google and what Google actually does, and it's this gap that SEO exploits for its own profit.<p>An infinite amount of exploitation would mean that Google would just return results randomly, and so it makes a lot of sense to detect signs of SEO and penalize the behavior before it further broadens the perfection/reality gap.  Gaming the system is currently profitable, since the worst thing that can happen to you is nothing, but the best thing is that you get more traffic.

That doesn't mean it's wrong in this case, but now you have code which is hidden so the interaction space is limited, so there could be:<p>1) Now you have to add complexity to get information into and out of this interaction space. Similar to how it's easier to walk onto a field than it is to walk into a castle - if the walls protect the contents, they also contort your path around them.<p>2) Leaky abstractions. It might be the case that your protected code is needed elsewhere. Now you have to duplicate it, or break around the protection/expose a new way through, all of which would not be necessary for a free function. At the very least you have overhead considering this. All of a sudden your neatly wrapped class is two classes, one in use in two places where you could again change code and have an effect far away if you're not careful.<p>3) In a language such as Python, you don't have your code inside a class protected by anything except convention. So it seems that you either must: a) accept that what protects groups of code is programmer attentive care, not the system of classes itself, and thus that any other programmer paying the right kind of attention could have the same benefits and less code, or b) declare languages like Python to be excluded from the benefits of classes by not implementing them properly.

I'm also curious about the cameras, although I wish they had been running at fixed sensitivity rather than constantly trying to balance between black space and a very reflective Earth.",1332050879

Heinlein, which is a fantastic science fiction book about colonizing Luna and the politics of an anarchistic government, he mentions the creation of a Rocket Sled (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_sled_launch"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_sled_launch</a>) which seems to never get mentioned when people talk about earth side technology for improving our ability to leave earth.<p>Does anyone know if there is some reason why this technology seems to get ignored? According to wikipedia it seems like a big win. Why aren't we doing this right now?",1332050508

Yahoo actually tried to solve this with a slider with an option for more shopping/info results but it didn't catch on as users don't want to click anything, they just want to type words in to the box and get the perfect answer - be it an ad or an actual result. If you make a user do anything else then you've already lost the game.<p>This is another reason why I don't think Google will fix this SEO problem it has any time soon, and I definitely don't think this current 'fix' will solve it either",1332050461
