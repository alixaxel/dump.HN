While it can be whimsical to compare the two, and while you could come up with a single definition that is loose enough to describe them both, they certainly are different.<p>The analogy breaks when you accept that, then, debtors prison was not meant to be ironic or figurative. It was a literal prison.<p>Most importantly, the socioeconomic factors matter. Your comment is almost offensive to me. I'm an engineer in the bay area. I work for a startup. It's important to remember that while my colleagues and I aren't full-on rich, we are very very well off. As an engineer with 5-15 years experience, you have myriad options to earn between 100-150k. That's the middle of the bell curve. And it goes up from there with more experience, I just haven't made it that far yet.<p>Sure, the bay area is an expensive place to live.

3718963,comment,3717715,3718462,8,0,hackinthebochs,,,"I feel all this talk against OO is missing the fundamental idea being objects: You are in fact <i>strictly</i> reducing the solution complexity by the proper use of classes. They are a mechanism of data-hiding. I know data within a class cannot be accessed outside of my defined interface, thus my ""interaction space"" has been reduced. That is, there is data I can't access and code that cannot access my data. This is a marked reduction in solution complexity.<p>The same can be said about functional programming. But once you degenerate to passing a ton of parameters around in each function call, you're probably better off defining an explicit object anyway.<p>Measuring complexity by number of lines and saying defining a class is adding complexity is off the mark.",1332039493

3718945,comment,3717609,3717609,3,0,SkyMarshal,,,"Great hack.  Slight diversion but I just bought that router a few weeks ago, flashed it with Tomato Speedmod firmware [2], and love it.  First router I've owned in years that is fast, has no lag, no drops, no hangups, and is completely trouble free.  Plus, Linux (ssh, etc).  I think that's due to the combination of stable, reliable hardware and continually evolving OSS firmware [1][2][3][4]<p>It also occurs to me the extent to which software can squeeze every ounce of power and performance out of even old hardware, but requires time to evolve and optimize (the last 20% of performance/reliability requires 80% of the work, but makes a big difference).  Hence, this 2004 router is better than any other router I've owned since then.  And I'm not alone in that assessment, as positive reviews are still rolling in weekly [5][6].<p>In Bill Gate's day, 640k was enough for any good programmer.  Eg, systems were hardware bound.  But now that appears reversed, and in many cases systems don't reach the hardware's limits simply because the software isn't given enough time to evolve and optimize.  By the time the software gets to, say, 80% of the hardware capability, the model is discontinued for a shiny new one, but with software that's starting over again on a new platform.<p>Thankfully that's not always the case, as with this router, or all of Apple's products for instance.<p>1.

3718942,comment,3717715,3718901,2,0,gruseom,,,"I've been as influenced by that essay as anybody here, but I'm not sure I believe in a power continuum anymore. How powerful a language is depends on who is using it. You can't abstract that away, but if you include it the feedback loops make your head explode.<p>The trouble I have with what you're saying is it suggests that a better paradigm (e.g. FP), higher-level and more powerful, will improve upon and succeed OO. But the greatest breakthroughs in my own programming practice have come from <i>not</i> thinking paradigmatically- to be precise, from seeing what I was assuming and then not assuming it.<p>Edit: My own experience has been this weird thing of moving <i>back down</i> the power continuum into an old-fashioned imperative style of programming, but still very much in Lisp-land. For me this has been a huge breakthrough. Yet my code isn't FP and it certainly isn't OO, so I guess it must be procedural. How much of this is dependent on the language flexibility that comes with Lisp? vs. just that Lisp happens to be what I like? Hard to say, but I suspect it's not irrelevant. If you can craft the language to fit your problem, you can throw out an awful lot. Like, it's shocking how much you can throw out.",1332038554

3718940,comment,3717968,3718127,2,0,fdr,,,"I, too, am weary of this provision.  If there is no obligation to make information available, all this will do is embolden the inside-track of investors who can get information at the expense of everyone else.  There will be strong pressure for the former to misrepresent and mislead the latter, and now that the cap of 500 investors has been lifted, the latter type of investor -- one with low leverage, in particular -- is available in much greater supply.  Yet, I find the idea of allowing many smaller investors participating in the funding of a company compelling, but it is more likely that there will be a lot of heterogeneity in the size and leverage of investors in a firm that seems to me that it could lead to a lot of ugly situations.<p>Are there even minimal disclosure requirements in this bill for such ""emerging"" companies?

You've omitted at least one critical thing: the name. But even if the list were complete, it's a fallacy to say ""if you dislike the combination, you must be opposed to one of its components"".<p>(The name is critical because the human mind leaps irresistibly from names to things, something you appear not to be considering. But I already wrote about that.)<p>Organizing code, making it nicer, reducing complexity? all I can say is that my own programs got far better when I stopped organizing them into classes. They became shorter, easier to write, easier to test, easier to change, and more fun to produce. But we're in YMMV territory here. I do feel like stating, though, that I worked for years in the style you describe. I even taught it. And I said and believed many of the same things. Should that count for something? Maybe not. Maybe I just got bored and went off.<p>Encapsulation? The most grossly overrated allegedly simplifying mechanism ever. But ""any code could be modifying blah""? Any code can do a lot of horrible things. Trying to rely on technical constructs to prevent it just adds weight and bloat and impediments. Let's have flexible languages and be good programmers.<p>Difficult to reason about? The hardest code I've ever tried to understand has been complex object models where Thingy depends on Fooey which needs a Bingy and a Batty, and to construct a Batty you need a... Compared to this sort of conceptual glob, bad procedural code has always, in my experience, been easier to understand.<p>Inheritance vs. composition? Not relevant here. Maybe I should have said ""graph"" instead of ""hierarchy"". Whether A ""is"" or ""has"" a B, that's still an edge in a graph, and it's those object graphs I'm talking about. They are much harder to rework than functions. The trouble is that when we believe that programming <i>is</i> making object graphs, we assume that difficulty to be part of the problem and don't notice it.<p>Rewriting? You rewrote something to be clearer and more intuitive <i>to you</i> and maybe to others who share your beliefs. That it happened to come out in objects is a consequence, not a cause, of what you find clear.  It's a lot harder to judge clarity across assumption sets. For example, I work a lot in JS and defining JS objects is the one thing I never do. Maybe if each of us put our code in front of the other we'd recoil to exactly the same distance :)",1332037956

I'm a current DevBootcamp student, and I've never been in an environment more conducive to learning <i>anything</i>.<p>As a student you're surrounded by 19+ other students that are highly motivated and highly intelligent. We've also got access to fantastic and experienced mentors that are available to answer our every question and help us solve every problem that we may encounter.<p>I'll leave you with a quote from a recent thread on a Rails list from a fellow student (Ben Johnston):<p>""The course itself has exceeded my highest expectations. A typical day starts with optional Yoga in the morning. After breakfast we have a 1-2 hour class given by Shereef followed by some pairing on exercises or a project. When we are working by ourselves Shereef and the mentors roam around answering questions. We sometimes have a second impromptu class after lunch where Shereef will go deeper on a subject he sees us struggling with during the morning session. Then we go back to the pairing stations and hack away for three or four hours. We have speakers come in once or twice a week to talk to us about what it takes to become a great developer, how they work on projects and what to expect in the industry. The background of the speakers vary, we've had developers from companies like ThoughtWorks and Pivotal Labs, CEOs from big companies like IGN or startup founders like Michael Staton from Inigral. Every Tuesday Twitter engineers come to the space to teach us Javascript. Most students stay late every night. It is not uncommon for half the class to still be coding at 11pm.<p>DBC has been the hardest and most rewarding thing I have ever done professionally. I am inspired by my class mates everyday. They ""lean forward into the problem"" no matter how daunting it is. Shereef reinforces this attitude by relentlessly throwing us in the deep end and now we embrace that feeling of discomfort when something seems beyond our ability. I consider myself a developer now and know I can build really cool stuff. I can't begin to describe how good that feels and how grateful I am to Shereef for putting together such an incredible program. It has genuinely changed my life and was well worth the tuition (most of which will be refunded if we get a job from one of the 20+ employers coming to meet us). """,1332036169
