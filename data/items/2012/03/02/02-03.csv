There are still two logical errors in your argument:<p>1) There are a <i>lot</i> of differences between the US and Singapore.  Health care is only one of them; the original article listed several more.  Even if you're right that health care costs <i>alone</i> only lead to a 16% advantage (which is probably off by a factor of 3-4, given overall health care spending in each country), don't forget all the other areas.<p>2) Not everywhere is the Bay Area.  Perhaps the Bay Area can compete with Singapore, but the Bay Area has a lot of unique advantages.  Are we writing off everyone not in the Bay Area?  And don't say ""oh, they can just move here""; the infrastructure won't support it.<p>The original author wants to talk about Singapore and high tech jobs; you picked only one of several differences which made Singapore attractive, and then compared it to the most attractive region in the US.  And even on that basis, it looks a bit like a toss up.<p>Let's close by turning back to Singapore.  As you admit, Singapore is much more business friendly.  And it has very enviable economic statistics.  I already mentioned the 2% unemployment, so let's look at GDP per capita.  Using PPP, Singapore comes in 3rd worldwide in 2011 according to the IMF[2], with a per capita GDP of $60k - 24% higher than the US.<p>Remember that per capita GDP is a measure of the value added in an economy.  In concrete terms, those numbers mean that the average person in Singapore is so productive that they can afford a lifestyle 24% nicer than the average person in America.  Your example tried to argue that Americans are so much more productive than Singaporeans that you can cover the health care costs and still come out ahead.  The statistics say that on average, it actually the Singaporeans who are more productive.<p>(Mind you:  Singapore is small, and in many ways unique.  I'm not suggesting that it's possible or desirable to copy their model on the scale of the US.  Also, they have high inequality, and poor protection of civil liberties.  I suspect many Americans value their relatively low inequality and strong civil liberties.  And yet...repealing Obamacare and <i>properly</i> reforming American health care to be along more Singaporean lines would not obviously lead to higher inequality or weaker civil liberties, and it is clear that it could lead to a wealthier society and higher job growth.  Something to keep in mind...)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STIStory_761247.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Singapore/Story/STI...</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_...</a>",1330655450
3655088,comment,3654160,3654934,3,0,josevalim,,,"Hey metajack, glad you enjoyed some bits of the language and also thanks for the criticism.<p>Designing a language requires some trade-offs and the ""do"" is one of them. It is a keyword and its main goal is to reduce the number of parenthesis. You could write this in Elixir:<p><pre><code>  if true, do: (something; then_another_something)\n</code></pre>\nBut with do, you can give a many expressions straight away:<p><pre><code>  if true do\n    something\n    then_another_something\n  end\n</code></pre>\nSo, at first it may give the impression that the commas and do are aleatory, but after you get the hang of the syntax, it will hopefully make your code less noisy.<p>Finally, yes, the semantics in the end are Erlang semantics. My previous attempt at writing a language for the Erlang VM machine was fighting against Erlang semantics and that didn't end up well. :)<p>In the future though, you may choose to go with Elixir instead of Erlang because of its features. Macros and protocols are good features to make you more productive and your code more extensible. I am available for discussion at #elixir-lang on freenode.",1330655448

There are very few other ""files"" like them, in that an attacker copying them can deprive you of their value in a way that you cant protect with backups. I feel a big part of current ""internet security best practices"" are about minimising the risk of getting exploited - but with a pragmatic limit to how much effort you invest mediated by the excuse of ""if we _do_ get rooted, we can always reinstall and recover from backups"". It'll only cost you time, and perhaps some reputation, and may put assumed-private-to-you information in someone else's hands, but it hasn't deprived you of access to any of your data. That doesn't apply to bitcoin wallets, and example like this are pointing out flaws in assumptions people are making about appropriate ways to manage them.<p>It'd suck to be ""that guy"" who provides the object lesson in why we need to think differently about bitcoin wallets to just about any other file type we might put on an internet accessible machine, but we _do_, and I don't know whether we have an answer to the question ""Is there a way to secure a bitcoin wallet on a machine someone else has root access to (either your datacenter's staff with physical access, or the people with hypervisor access to the hardware your vm is running on)?""<p>I _think_ the answer is ""if you can't trust those people, you can't risk storing your bitcoins there"".

No matter what, if you don't need a huge amount of money to start, the initial barriers to entry in monetary terms are low. It is certainly not impossible to build a sizable business out of complete obscurity without investment (because money is just one barrier to entry), it is just extremely difficult to do.<p>If it is easy to build, there will be an enormous amount of competition until the ability to make any money is squeezed out. If it is extremely difficult to build, your competition will be very limited.<p>So I actually believe the exact opposite is true- the more investment money you NEED, the less competition you're going to face. It may be tempting to think that if you just go after a very small, niche market, you can corner it really easily because everyone else will ignore it in favor of larger opportunities, but that's just not realistic.
