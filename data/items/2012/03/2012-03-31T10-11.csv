The Android market is so large, and becoming larger every day, that other developers will gladly do the work you refuse to do.

3779966,comment,3779672,3779672,10,0,dendory,,,"I think it's very valid criticism and it can't really be compared with Windows. There's many differences:<p>- Windows has a lot of APIs and hardware abstraction levels. Microsoft has always been known to change things very, very slowly, and keep backward compatibility.<p>- Hardware makers don't mess with Windows nearly as much as they do with Android. They will install a Norton trial and that's it. They don't remove the UI and put their own.<p>- Microsoft acts as a gate to what innovation hardware vendors can bring in, even more so today with driver testing and signing. Remember back in the day when an OEM did something crazy you'd get BSODs from bad drivers. Now that doesn't happen anymore, because everything is so much more robust. Android is still no where near that, and Google isn't doing much, relying on the open community.",1333188575

It would be slow, because it's most likely a slow one with no GPU acceleration and such, but I wouldn't be surprised if 95%+ of Windows apps ran on it. The only reason you, yourself couldn't test it is because they (obviously) run their own ATM software full screen and block you from installing stuff.
