3719226,comment,3717715,3719120,0,0,overgard,,,"As a person who has written games, I think games are one of those weird cases where OO really shines, but I don't think it's representative of most general programming problems. In my experience OO makes a ton of sense when you have a lot of mutable state that actually represents a tangible real world object or metaphor. So that works great for games, which are all about simulation, and where you actually have a lot of things that really do map to an ""object"".<p>But, outside of simulations, a lot of programming problems come down to things that don't have a convenient real world mapping. A lot of it is just data transformations, and data transformations are awkward in an OO setting, because the focus is on the object rather than the process. This is where more functional styles really shine, (for instance, in compilers and such), where the existance of an object would be incredibly transient and short lived, because the goal is to transform one set of data into another representation. OOP basically sucks at this.<p>Objects are certainly useful, but I think they've been fetishized to a weird degree.",1332049724

If you decide not to go on to grad school, a certificate is not as valuable as the second bachelors.  A certificate may get you into the same school, but after a year you may want to apply for other masters programs.  No one is going to give much credit to a certificate except the people who issued it.  Plus maybe you could apply for a five year masters program and double count those last few credits.<p>Its not the low GPA that is going to hurt you, it is the complete difference between STEM and non-STEM degree programs.  Do you understand advanced math? Are you at least an intermediate level programmer?  You actually need these skills to be able to complete graduate courses in CS.<p>It's only worth the debt if you are committed to turning your degree into a profitable career.  That means you would need to work towards an engineering position while doing this.

Taking courses for a certificate could be a good way to test programming out, as well as learning on your own.<p>To be honest, you are going to have a hard time getting into a highly ranked CS master's program with the GPA that you had in college. Also, most CS master's programs require some level of CS knowledge before enrolling. Therefore doing either a certificate program and/or learning on your own would be very helpful before enrolling.<p>After 6 months or a year of progress, then consider enrolling in a master's program if if still feels like the right thing to do. One thing that is nice about programming jobs is that it is more about what you can do than the degree you have. There are a ton of great resources online that can help you learn if you have enough dedication to stick with it.<p>Best of luck.",1332048920

I thought it made sense going up (although I wasn't sure why its rate of change---which would be the acceleration---seemed to increase a bit), but then I was totally baffled after the separation.  It goes down from 2900 to 2500, then back up to 2920, then it plummets to around 300, then gently lowers down to the 50 or so that it's at for splashdown; there is no discernible change in acceleration when the chutes blow around 190.<p>Here's what I would have expected: numbers increasing at a relatively constant rate until separation, then a rapid decrease to zero (and since 1mph ~~ .5m/s, expected decrease at about 20mph/s), then increasing again (maybe with a negative sign) until atmosphere, then a decrease to terminal velocity, then another big decrease when the chutes blow.<p>So aside from the fact that there is no direction (not even a minus sign), so it's at best a speed counter, there still is something I really don't understand about that number.

Getting away from classes does not free you from the need for names; and in a dynamically typed language, it requires even more attention to names - see my other comment <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3719056"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3719056</a><p>I almost invariably find I need more than one closure down the road, outside of simple predicates handed off to algorithms. Even for such simple things as specifying a sink for output (out :: string -> ()), later on I find myself wanting a flush() routine. That's just my experience: problems grow thornier over time, and starting out with something more object-like adapts to that growth more gracefully than a closure does.<p>I think a lot of the problem comes from the syntactic weight of classes. I've implemented closures in a commercial compiler; the actual implementation, when it uses captured state, is very similar to a class, and in fact the implementation method I chose behind the scenes was a class. So I tend to view closures (rather than simple function literals that don't capture state) as just a concise way of declaring and instantiating an object.<p>I've had some success with blending the two. For example, a read-only collection facade is often implemented in .NET with ReadOnlyCollection<T>. But the normal way of implementing that thing is to pass off an IList<T>, which you may need to implement wholly if the logical read-only collection is not already a list. I think that's a complete waste of time; instead, I wrote a function that takes two closure arguments, getCount :: () -> int and getItem :: int -> T, and henceforth I can create a new collection with new behaviour without worrying about the ""name"" of the descendant, but with the benefits of a class for flexibility down the road.",1332047912

A laptop is something that would have been very useful to me, as it turns out it always ended up one lower then other things on the budgetary priority.  That doens't make it a luxury/status item as you said 3 up.<p>Ultimately there's a contradiction in your claim that a laptop in general is not a luxury/status good (""sign of affluence"" - wiki) but a cheaper iPad, which often functions as a laptop substitute, somehow is.",1332047270

A sonic boom doesn't just happen as you pass the sound barrier, but rather trails behind an aircraft the entire time it is traveling over that critical speed. This resulted in the Concorde only being able to travel faster than the speed of sound when it was over water (hence it's primary use for travel between New York and Paris or London).<p>But what if you could travel where there is no air?<p>Suborbital space flight means that any place on the globe is a 2 hour flight away.

I don't think it even applies to organizations that go over the 500 (soon to be 2000 with this bill, is that actually enough for super-microfunded kickstarter style startups?) investor limit, but I am no expert.<p>I'm not asking for much. Maybe even just what is filed for tax returns would be enough, or maybe not (or maybe it's more than necessary).  It just seems like no disclosure obligations at all (and I'm not even sure if that's what the bill actually provides) is too few obligations.<p>Case in point, Facebook.  For a long time -- may be even now -- authoritative numbers of numbers like revenue or profit that would be seen on their tax filing are probably only known to investors with sufficient leverage, AFAIK.
