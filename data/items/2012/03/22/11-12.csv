If the pirate bay is working on what other people are working on It won't be a little quadrocopter.<p>NPR recently did a story on what the future of commercial drones are shaping up to be [1]. The deal is they are working on drones with huge wingspans that require very little propulsion to stay airborne and can carry both solar panels to collect energy and batteries to store that energy. The planed flight time for one of these aircraft would be on the order of years. As of today they have successfully tested drones of this kind that can stay aloft for weeks. If thats the kind of technology the LOSS will leverage then it will fit the role nicely.<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/2011/12/05/143144146/drone-technology-finding-its-way-to-american-skies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2011/12/05/143144146/drone-technology-fin...</a>",1332417585

3739326,comment,3739193,3739193,43,0,nkoren,,,"In the biomimicry department, I'd look to the birds. Imagine an ornithopter mimic that seeks out power lines, clamps onto them, and powers itself via inductive pickups in its feet. Its battery gives it a 10-minute flying range; this gets recharged first. Then it goes into broadcast mode.<p>Sure, its signals could be triangulated, but if the mimicry is clever enough then it might be difficult to distinguish from a real bird. And it could be equipped with various means of monitoring its environment (such as an RF receiver which monitors the strength of nearby police-frequency broadcasts), which would allow it to rapidly bug out at the first sign of trouble. It takes to the air, circles for a few minutes, then finds another power line and starts over again.",1332417554

Yes, that's like $90 a round for 10 people in a New York bar.

It doesn't have to be a steak dinner for 20 people - I know I can't afford that. But if you go out for wings and beer, buy around of beers. If you don't want to do that, go to the local bakery and bring in two dozen bagels and cream cheese.

3739311,comment,3739165,3739271,1,0,kator,,,"True. I imagine modern compilers optimize this sort of stuff very quickly.  Back in the time that code was written it was better to just optimize directly in the code and not wonder if the compiler would do it for you.<p>I'm not advocating the code, more I wonder about how much the general population of developers has lost connection with the underlying performance of things.  The systems we work with today are so powerful that they forgive errors that just could not be ignored on older systems.<p>I recently re-wrote a streaming MapReduce job from Perl to C code and improved it literally 10x in speed.  I resisted doing it because most of my team doesn't understand C well enough to slice and dice a bunch of pointers and buffers etc.  I wanted  maintainable code that the rest of my team could maintain.  But in the end I needed performance so short of writing it in assembly C was the next best thing.",1332417167

Would Dropbox convert better if they had descriptive text on their home page, or at least made the features link more visible than the one in the footer? We'll never know unless Dropbox tests it and publishes the results.<p>When I think of software sold to businesses, I'm reminded of the place I used to work where the president had the IT department disable the speakers on all new PC's. He didn't want employees sitting around watching videos or listening to music on company time. It may be hard to fathom for some people, but there are offices where playing videos (even demos) is frowned upon - especially in a cube farm.<p>If you want to make conversions, think of all the barriers between you and the sale, and start knocking them down one by one.

That's kind of a mix between HTML5 history being so slow to come out and Google encouraging the # stuff in the first place. But everyone's still learning. Full page postback-less js applications are still a pretty new field.<p>Twitter were a very early trail blazer. As much as people hate it, kudos to them for having the balls to try it and let us all learn from their mistakes. I've got a project that's a horrible mix between postback and postbackless stuff. It's almost dailyWTF worthy, but I don't regret doing it as it's getting closer to getting it done right. And there are people using it right now and it works as much as I cringe about it.<p>For example if you look at the 1.5Mb js file they send when I do an anonymous request, it's got every possible action I could ever do regardless of whether you're on a tweet page, the main page, a profile page, etc. It doesn't matter if I'm signed in or not. They're all in there as templates. And then for some reason they wack in a load of compressed jQuery stuff, etc. It has how to sign up, how to add people to follow, congratulation screen for when your first few follows, etc.<p>That, to me, is just nuts. Why is there no split in the js dependant on the kind of user they're going to be? On reflection they probably think that too.<p>With regards to development environments, I do think you should force your programmers to understand your infrastructure. Give new programmers a couple of simple examples to play with on how to manage dependencies and loading files and that's that. In my view it's no different to saying 'we use these parts of C++, not these' or 'this is our coding style, you must follow it or your checkins will be rejected'. Or 'this is how the industry this app is for works, these are the general business rules most of them have, this is the general workflow'.<p>New programmers to your organisation always have to pick up some contextual information over time. It's your job to train them in the most relevant key information asap. I think far too often it's just a case of 'you're a programmer you're smart, let's just throw you in at the deep end and see if you can swim. Oh, why did you swim into the shark pen? Silly n00b.'.
