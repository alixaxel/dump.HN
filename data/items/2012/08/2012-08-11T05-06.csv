4369561,comment,4366125,4369401,3,0,potatolicious,,,"If you truly think that most people have ""fairly equal"" access to opportunities, you understand <i>extremely</i> little of the world.<p>It's easy to vilify a straw man you've never met.<p>> <i>""They aren't trying. They aren't taking the opportunity that sits before them. They are existing because government pays for everything for them. How is that even deniable?""</i><p>This is an extraordinary claim that requires substantial evidence. You are making a very serious accusation against a very large group of people, the least you can do is back it up.<p>A family of 4 on food stamps gets $688 a month to feed themselves. Do you serious think government ""pays for everything"" for them? Do you think <i>anyone</i> of sound mind would voluntary put themselves in that situation permanently? How many people do you think receive food stamps and think to themselves ""score! This paltry sum that probably won't cover my barest expenses is a strong incentive not to seek work!"".<p>Have you <i>met</i> someone on welfare or food stamps? I have. A whole lot of them actually. It's an extremely rough life - rest assured no one in their right mind is enjoying it. Those who stay in it long-term are <i>unable</i> to get away from it, not <i>unwilling</i>. This is a critical difference.<p>Your argument makes about as much sense as claiming the homeless are homeless voluntarily (sadly, a common argument amongst conservatives) - it comes from a complete ignorance of just how tough life is when you've stripped away the basics.<p>Your mythical American, who is lazy, good-for-nothing, and sits around doing nothing because the government is magically covering all of his expenses, I'm sorry to say, doesn't really exist. To be fair, it is <i>possible</i> for this person to exist in extremely small numbers as edge cases of the system.<p>But, just to humor you, let's assume this mythical creature <i>does</i> exist. How many of them <i>are</i> there?<p>Welp, there are 6.16 million Americans on long-term unemployment as of last month (there are actually more people unemployed than that, but they're not eligible to receive benefits, so for the purposes of identifying ""leeches"", they're not relevant). This is 2.5% of the total work force.<p>Only a portion of these people are actually lazy and idle though - naturally part of this 6.16 million are actually looking for work, but are unable to find anything. They are, by any reasonable measure, not leeches. There is also another portion which is simply no longer eligible for benefits (despite what you seem to think, they do expire, making the long-term plan of ""sitting on my ass while the gov't bankrolls my life"" a really poor one).<p>Let's be incredibly cynical, pessimistic, and presumptuous about our fellow man (that is your theme, it seems), and assume that a whopping <i>half</i> of all long-term unemployed folks are there voluntarily. Disregard the fact that a large portion of them would have lapsed benefits by this point.<p>So, <i>maximally, assuming the absolute worst about everything</i>, about 1.25% of the total work force is a lazy-ass sonofabitch that's getting benefits from the government (shitty benefits that in no way funds a comfortable lifestyle, but whatever, assume these people have third-world expectations for themselves).<p>You're getting your panties in a bunch, balking at <i>taxation in general</i>, and yammering on about the government stealing your treasures to fuel undeserving people... because 1.25% of the work force (0.96% of the overall population) fits that description?<p>""Unsustainable"" indeed! You decry taxation in general as ""redistributionist"" because, <i>maximally</i>, 0.96% of the population is a lazy bastard? You balk at the public funding of roads, bridges, and public utilities because, heaven forbid, 0.96% of the population (maximally!) doesn't deserve access to it?<p>Oh my.<p>Allow me to dig a little deeper. You dislike taxation, you dislike the government forcing you to pay for things. So you take a tired, old stereotype to justify <i>not</i> paying into the public good, out of some notion that there are hordes of malicious people at the gates just waiting to take advantage of you. You play up and exaggerate this stereotype to make it seems like a bigger deal than it actually is - even though in reality this stereotype hardly exists at all, and certainly not in great enough numbers to justify the moral panic you're suggesting.<p>You started this argument by moralizing against these supposed malicious freeloaders, but when your emotional appeals are deconstructed, you try to twist your argument in the ""public good"" direction - by insisting (without basis) that the funding of said ill-defined freeloaders is unsustainable and will break us all, even though it doesn't stand a chance in hell of doing that.",1344664618

4369540,comment,4366203,4366203,20,0,kamaal,,,"The author seems to be stuck in a country which is rising after coming from a country which had already risen. The path to success is no cake walk, its tiring and it causes fatigue.<p>As as Indian this article to me on many counts also looks like the story of India. The west will find it difficult to digest but the desperation to grow forces a person to go out of his way to do and achieve things people in the west in all the comfort cannot imagine in wildest of their dreams.<p>>>Modern day mainland Chinese society is focused on one object: money and the acquisition thereof.<p>What other dreams do you think poor people have?<p>>>The domestic Chinese lower education system does not educate. It is a test center. The curriculum is designed to teach children how to pass them.<p>The issue in Asian countries which are developing is most have only one shot at doing something in life. Study your ass off or perish, there is no social security- Your parents work hard to give you a decent education and you work hard in a once in a life time opportunity to do something in life. There is no other alternative, you don't have money to do business. The national infrastructures, license problems, corruption and other stuff won't give you a second shot at business.<p>There fore unlike in the west where 'chase your dreams' makes sense, here it doesn't.<p>>>Success in exams offers a passport to a better life in the big city. Schools do not produce well-rounded, sociable, self-reliant young people with inquiring minds. They produce winners and losers. Winners go on to college or university to take business studies. Losers go back to the farm or the local factory their parents were hoping they could escape.<p>As I said before, opportunities are at a premium here. This is difficult to understand if you come from US and settle down here. You will just never get why there is such a mad rush for opportunities.<p>>>The pressure makes children sick. I speak from personal experience. To score under 95 per cent is considered failure. Bad performance is punished. Homework, which consists mostly of practice test papers, takes up at least one day of every weekend. Many children go to school to do it in the classroom. I have seen them trooping in at 6am on Sundays. In the holidays they attend special schools for extra tuition, and must do their own schools homework for at least a couple of hours every day to complete it before term starts again. Many of my local friends abhor the system as much as I do, but they have no choice. I do. I am lucky.<p>Whoa this is nothing. In India while I did by second year of pre university college, I practically slept only for 3 hours a day for the whole year. Before going to the exam I cried. Because my whole years worth of hard work depended on this one exam! During my engineering college days, I've spend endless nights studying without sleeping. Same with school.<p>As a software engineer I've gone a whole week without sleep. And that was perfectly acceptable. My dad used to tell me, to consider myself lucky to even deserve the opportunity to go and work at a software company. Hence <i>anything</i> was acceptable.<p>>>An option is to move back to a major Chinese city and send our children to an expensive international schoolnone of which offer boardingbut I would be worried about pollution, and have to get a proper job, most likely something to do with foreign business to China, which my conscience would find hard.<p>Good schooling is shit expensive. Hence parents almost always send their kids to a local mediocre school. But warn them sternly to study very hard or they will have no future.<p>>>China does not nurture and educate its youth in a way that will allow them to become the leaders, inventors and innovators of tomorrow, but that is the intention.<p>Thats for the next generation. The first generation, like my Dad's. They had only one goal- 'First get your kids somewhere, let them take it from there on.'<p>The author is clearly stuck in a massive cultural conflict in his brain. He wants China to remain where it was, a mediocre country compared to his original homeland. He doesn't understand the cultural pressures of families in developing nations. He doesn't understand those countries are trying to go to where, his homeland is now. He clearly belongs to his native culture, where bulk of the growth work is already done, and people are just building on top of it. Where you can get to enjoy foreign vacations, passion based work environments, freedom to not worry about basic stuff like food, clothing and shelter.",1344663424

Now you have two problems.<p>Political terminology in the United States is MASSIVELY warped by entities who spend literally millions of dollars in an effort to connotatively redefine words. When you (re)define words like ""conservative"" or ""liberal"" you risk alienating people who have been conditioned to have an emotional response to either definition. If you define a term in a way that seems pejorative to your reader, the reader will weight every subsequent statement against the rigor they think you brought (or did not bring) to those definitions. Your essay will entirely fail to persuade if it rests on (perceived) faulty definitions.<p>When writing to a largely US audience, no attempt at honest communication will be aided by the application of political labels.<p>Here's a test: can the essay be rewritten without that political terminology?

4369517,comment,4369079,4369323,10,0,guns,,,"> <i>You have encodings, Unicode, ASCII, UTF-8, ISO 9660, Latin-1, code pages, UTF-16, byte order masks, gettext macros, po files, ... the terminology and model of the problem domain are extremely complex and difficult to understand.</i><p>In the beginning, there was ASCII [1]. It was a simple encoding that mapped a byte stream to standard American letters, numerals, punctuation marks, as well as some common non-printing control codes.<p>ASCII only used the lower 7 bits of the 8-bit byte, reserving the upper 128 positions for any non-American characters needed for national encodings.<p>And indeed, many dozens of national character encodings appeared that used ASCII for its lower 128 positions and implemented their own character table in the upper 128. One very popular encoding was Latin-1 [2]. This became the standard encoding in much Western software because it adequately handled the most widely used Western languages.<p>One major problem with these 8-bit national encodings is that the upper 128 codes are mutually exclusive with one another. Confusingly, they almost all shared the base 128 ASCII codes, so programmers and users began to equate ""plain text"" and ""sane encoding"" with 7-bit ASCII, since one could effectively communicate universally by restricting the characters used to those in the printable ASCII table.<p>As it became clear that the proliferation of 8-bit encodings was untenable, there emerged Unicode. Unicode is not an encoding, but a standard that provides a table of universal code points, along with some recommendations about how to combine and display certain code points. [3]<p>Unicode is implemented in the modern day by UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, which are primarily distinguished, as you might guess, by the base size of the code unit.<p>UTF-32 is a simple encoding that simply maps every Unicode code point to a 32-bit sequence. This is simple to parse, but potentially very wasteful, so is rarely used.<p>UTF-16 uses 16-bit code units, and is able to simply translate the most commonly used portion of Unicode, the Basic Multilingual Plane. For code points above U+ffff, a scheme is used to span the code point along two code units. This encoding is used frequently in Windows, and in Java.<p>UTF-8 is a variable length Unicode encoding like UTF-16, but defaults to a small one-byte code unit and has a famously elegant algorithm, so it appeals strongly to miserly Unix hackers.<p>> <i>For example, one time I downloaded some tarball (I forget what it was) that had a few bytes of binary garbage at the beginning of every file. After some research I found out that it's called the BOM and has something to do with international text, and I ended up having to WRITE A SCRIPT WHICH GOES THROUGH AND DELETES THE FIRST FEW BYTES OF EVERY FILE IN A TREE in order to use the tarball's contents.</i><p>The Byte Order Mark is clunky solution to the fundamental problem of divining the character encoding of an arbitrary byte stream. It's great if all your tools transparently support it, but annoying if not. However, some sort of convention or metadata is necessary to correctly encode your data. Python, Ruby, and other scripting languages have begun to coalesce around the magic encoding comment for source files (i.e. `# encoding: utf-8` as the first or second line).<p>Most everybody falls back to ASCII if no encoding is specified, or cannot be inferred from the stream itself. The better fallback is UTF-8, because breakages like yours are less likely to occur, which is why it is encouraged as the default system encoding in most cases.<p>> <i>Another time, I downloaded some Java source which contained the author's name in comments. The author was German and his name contains an ""o"" with two dots over it. That was the only non-ASCII character in the files. Eclipse and command-line javac WOULD NOT PROCESS THE FILE and I ended up removing his name from all comments; after that it compiled without a hitch. This was the official Oracle (then Sun) javac. A fricking SOURCE TO BYTECODE COMPILER SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON YOUR SYSTEM'S NATIONALITY SETTINGS -- OR ANY LOCAL SYSTEM SETTINGS! -- TO DO ITS JOB. But it does.</i><p>These tools likely have ways of setting the encoding without inheriting from the environment, but they do fall back on the environment as a simple convention.<p>The trouble is that there is no reason any longer to assume that all text _must_ be 7-bit ASCII. Unix and programming languages are evolving to handle this new multilingual digital world. The only obstacle that really remains are programmers, so I think it's fair to spend a little time learning the basics of the subject.<p>[1]: There were other antediluvian encodings (like EBCDIC)<p>[2]: a.k.a.

One of the quickest ways to burn bridges and ensure you are perceived as caring more about your own ego and ""needs"" than anything else, is to re-implement something without talking to anyone about it, be they the authors, stakeholders or 3rd-party dependents. This kind of ""look at me, manager! look what I did!"" behavior is the cancerous seed of a team ruled by self-seeking and ego.<p>If your needs would benefit the whole and are not a mere excuse for egoism, but are not aligned with the company/team, get another job.<p>In the end, the author learned a lesson, but the wrong one.

They all charge upwards for 25-35 cents per eligibility transaction.<p>The software company I work for sells a healthcare product which includes automatic real-time eligibility verification. We don't charge per transaction. We can afford to do for two reasons 1) we put a lot of effort into finding cheap/free/redundant real-time connections to payers and 2) we can simply eat the cost as part of the margin for our product. Our philosophy is that you should check eligibility often and always, at every point of the patient's encounter from scheduling to check-in. Per transaction costs scare away customers which is part of why we don't charge per transaction.",1344662001
