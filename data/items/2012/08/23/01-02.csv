Rewatchable is irrelevant to things that aren't movies. The scatter plot is only relevant if the correlation between the two is important, but the given graphs don't support that the correlation has meaningful information beyond that people who like a movie are more likely to want to rewatch it, which is a correlation that is likely consistent across all movies in their dataset and conveys little information about any particular movie.",1345687070

4420500,comment,4420404,4420404,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"It looks like a to-do list for writers. To show what makes it different, you really need to show how it makes it easier to visualize a complex story.<p>You chose the example of Robin Hood and his buddies stealing from the rich and running off into Sherwood forest, with the wicked sheriff in hot pursuit. From a writer's standpoint, this isn't a story, this is an episode - something happens, then something else happens. It's no more dramatic than a weather report. Dramatic tension arises from the differing outcomes that result from characters' choices - for example, Robin's friend is captured, so now Robin has to decide between fleeing or risking capture. A whole story involves a sequence of branching events, with various inputs and outputs such as characters, places, items and so on. I wish your video had taken the time to show a complex story made up of multiple episodes; as it is, I am not sure what makes it different from a stack of index cards.<p>You might want to look At Adobe Story, which is more geared towards film scripts but has a fairly slick interface for managing these 'fictional assets'. Final Draft is the market leader in that area, and while it's ugly and unintuitive in many ways, it does have a lot of valuable functionality because every noun or verb mentioned in a film script is eventually going to end up as as a line item in a very detailed budget and schedule.<p>Imagination is free for novelists, but the cost of organizing and structuring a complex story is in the editing and rewrite time, so try to show how your product can help authors manage complexity rather than how easy it is to get something into it.",1345686353

People learned (grudgingly) to use spam filters with their email because they had an existing service which had achieved large-scale network effect in a spam-free environment.

The problem is that contact names propagate outward from the master state where a push will update them.  For instance, they get written down on business cards.  They also get cached, imprudently but inevitably, in forms that are still digital but don't update properly.<p>Imagine a protocol that you could use to update your email address this way, and you'll see the problem.  In theory, you could design a special SMTP message that would cause all clients to update their address books.  In reality this would scale quite poorly and be quite unreliable, leading people to avoid it, leading it to be even more unreliable, etc.  Of course, your chances are much better with a bright, shiny new protocol... but still.",1345686100

4420461,comment,4420377,4420377,1,0,anigbrowl,,,"Goddamit Clement :)<p>One of the problems with the freemium model is that many people sometimes seem to pick a revenue target arbitrarily and then backfill their projections with the necessary conversion rate. Obviously, few firms or entrepreneurs want to expose their pricing models publicly in forums like HN, but startups need to be able to answer the question of what marginal utility they provide to their potential customers. The 'less than a cup of coffee!' model of app pricing, for example, assumes that since coffee is such a small thing users will be just as willing to throw down $3 for an app. But the coffee has physical, psychological and social value for the consumer that pays off on a predictable time horizon - and pays off not just the $3, but the time spent standing in line or buying and brewing your own coffee. Consumer preferences in for this commodity are sufficiently complex to support a large and extremely competitive market. If it was 'just coffee' then it would cost the same everywhere and vendors would be limited to normal rather than economic profits.<p>A better approach for vendors might be to assume your target consumer does <i>not</i> have endless disposable income. What value does your product or service provide that would make a coffee consumer go without their favorite beverage for a day? Or if not coffee, a competitor's offering or some other part of the consumer's <i>status quo</i>? How does your offering compare to the composite bundle?",1345685308

Ex-ante, many things are required to make any substantial change.  Ex-post, we can scrutinize and analyze and sometimes create a version of history that points to one as the key factor.  As others have pointed out, sometimes this is simply a top of the stack situation (last piece of effort is most important but would be true for whatever is last) and sometimes it's a genuine catalytic change (the last thing really was the biggest).  But since our decision-making about the future is fundamentally ex-ante, there usually is no silver bullet.  Also ex-post analyses are often based upon human surveys / analysis, which is highly flawed.  If you ask people, for example, why they love a certain product, they may respond with one feature and you might think that was the ""that one thing"" when in reality, they might love the overall experience, branding, support or something else entirely.",1345684332

It's easy to feel guilty charging a client high rates while you tackle an unfamiliar project, which requires you spend more time learning than producing. For me, consulting has been a constant tradeoff between taking jobs at high prices where I don't learn new things vs. lower prices when entering unfamiliar territory. I don't know if pricing services according to your ability to execute is best though. At the end of the day, you don't want to find your saying to your client: ""I did not execute as promised for whatever reason, but hey I didn't charge much!""\nThis situation shouldn't arise often if you are honest about your skills from the beginning.<p>2. Under promise and Over delivery<p>3. Spec out a project as well as possible beforehand. But agree upfront to a mid-way spec because projects change so fast that you may find yourself conducting tasks you should charge a lot more to do.<p>4. Build camaraderie with your client but hold your ground if they take advantage. Working with a variety of clients and building a network are advantages of the freelance world. Do you best to build quality relationships with your clients, so they tell your future clients that you are not only a great (insert job function), but also a great person. But I wouldn't go as far as to become so friendly that you feel bad charging them what you'd be making on another project.<p>Hope this helps",1345683612
