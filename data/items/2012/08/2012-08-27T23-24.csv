The best refutation I've seen is from obesity researcher Stephan Guyenet.<p>From <a href=""http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/08/carbohydrate-hypothesis-of-obesity.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2011/08/carbohydrate-h...</a><p><i>I hope you can see by now that the carbohydrate hypothesis of obesity is not only incorrect on a number of levels, but it may even be backward. The reason why obesity and metabolism researchers tend not to take this idea seriously is that it is contradicted by a large body of evidence from multiple fields. I understand that people like ideas that ""challenge conventional wisdom"", but the fact is that obesity is a complex state and it will not be shoehorned into simplistic hypotheses.<p>Carbohydrate consumption per se is not behind the obesity epidemic. However, once overweight or obesity is established, carbohydrate restriction can aid fat loss in some people. The mechanism by which this occurs is not totally clear, but there is no evidence that insulin plays a causal role in this process. Carbohydrate restriction spontaneously reduces calorie intake (as does fat restriction), suggesting the possibility that it alters body fat homeostasis, but this alteration likely occurs in the brain, not in the fat tissue itself. The brain is the primary homeostatic regulator of fat mass, just as it homeostatically regulates blood pressure, breathing rate, and body temperature. This has been suspected since the early brain lesion studies of the 1940s (47) and even before, and the discovery of leptin in 1994 cemented leptin's role as the main player in body fat homeostasis. In some cases, the setpoint around which the body defends these variables can be changed (e.g., hypertension, fever, and obesity). Research is ongoing to understand how this process works.</i>",1346109721

For the given opportunity cost, what's the impact on future earnings (over the next 10 years or so)?  Does working at a startup that gets acqui-hired give you a potential to make earn more in the future?  If so, how much more?<p>What if you break even in the long-run, but you value autonomy over money?  So you get a couple additional years of more autonomous work in for the same total money.  That's still a win, but we lack the financial forecasting instruments to properly value that.  The same can be said for all other non-monetary possible motivations for working at a startup.<p>Looking at the money you may have given up, and requiring that ALL of that be made up in one lump sum to be a success event seems silly.  It misses future income (which is relevant and can/should also be forecasted), as well as a number of other salient factors.<p>Any financial model we come up with, will still be just an opaque gage.  So if we're really just looking for a simple heuristic, looking at possible alternatives is an ideal choice (but as heuristics go, which all evaluations of this would be), it misses some things.

Are the rights under the EULA / ToS transferable due to terms explicitly in the EULA governing transferability?<p>2. If there are no explicit terms, what is the ""default setting"" for transferability?<p>3. Are the digital items being sold considered goods, services, or some combination?  (I'd imagine it's much easier to terminate a contract for ongoing services than to negate heirs' rights to goods the deceased has purchased.)<p>4. Is there a catch-all ""escape clause"" in the EULA which says ""We're allowed to terminate your right to access these songs or movies at any time for any reason, or no reason""?<p>5. What about the first sale doctrine?  Doesn't it say that you have some right to transfer items regardless of what the EULA / ToS says?<p>From a practical standpoint, you can probably transfer the account by just giving the password to the receiving heir.  Making new purchases on the old account may no longer be possible if they check to make sure the name on your credit card matches the name the account is registered to, but I'd imagine many providers don't do this check and only care about what your CC info says if they start getting chargebacks.<p>If you don't know the password and don't have access to the deceased's email to use the usual password reset mechanism, you may be facing an uphill battle.<p>It would also be a micromanagement nightmare to have several accounts on the same service with different content.  It might also trigger provider's alarms if you access several different accounts from the same IP address (although if the number is reasonably small -- less than ten, let us say -- hopefully they'll assume it's legit, i.e. multiple accounts belonging to different people living in the same house with a single NAT'ed Internet connection.)<p>The simple fact of the matter is that most Web businesses' domain modeling assumes that customers live forever.  What happens when they don't is basically anarchy.  We're still at the point where most of the people who die never had a large online presence, but in 30-50 years that will no longer be true.<p>An ideal situation for content providers would be for all content to be destroyed when someone dies, because then the next generation would have to buy it if they wanted it instead of inheriting it.  The problem is that this leads to cognitive dissonance, because heritability of possessions is a central feature of many cultures, including ours.<p>An ideal situation for consumers is complete transferability.  The first problem is that this encourages piracy -- if there was a free and legal resale market where any song could be sold for (let us say) $0.50, while songs can be bought on iTunes for $1.00, iTunes would make exactly $1.00 on each song it released, because exactly one person would buy it, then resell it (keeping a local copy), and its buyer would resell it, etc.  The second problem is that it's difficult for a company halfway around the country to differentiate between the legitimate heir of someone who's actually died and an account thief.",1346109361

Obviously if your stomach explodes or your intestine just plain stop working, caloric intake/deficit is now one of the least of your worries.<p>I think you actually hit the nail on the head here though, in using the word <i>""imply""</i>. Calories in - Calories out doesn't give you an <i>exact</i> picture, but it comes reasonably close for the purposes of most people.<p>It's by no means a perfect understanding, but someone who is obese needs simple rules that can successfully get them <i>started</i> more than they need a perfect knowledge of the science involved.",1346108592

But to my untrained eye, the first Galaxy S looked most like the iPhone 3GS. The Galaxy S2 adopted a brand new design language (more business-y and kevlar-like, super thin, bump on the back for some models) and I believe it sold the most. I remember reading the specs for the S2 when it first came out and it just impressed me how significantly it outclassed all phones up to that date. It was a no-brainer phone to get at that time all on its own merits not as a cheap copy of something else.",1346108457
