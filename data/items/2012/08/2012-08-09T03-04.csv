What is to stop the next person from turning evil too? A promise made by a person? Seriously?<p>If the new company were to come up with some decentralized architecture that would systemically prevent them from doing ads and would just establish an open protocol that anyone can use for a small licensing fee etc or some new way of making money, that would at least be something worth trying.<p>If the only difference is a promise that they won't do ads, hah.

From the publisher's point of view, it's completely legit:  A video that mixes public domain imagery with original additions.  Any news org that covered the landing without including some of NASA's public domain images or video would have everyone (rightly!) saying ""Their Mars coverage sucks!""<p>Even if they don't have original additions, it's in the public domain; publishers can do what they want with it, including merely slapping their watermark in the corner and uploading as-is.<p>I'd say that nobody's really ""at fault;"" rather, the widespread availability of technology to easily and cheaply download, remix, upload, and stream video is presenting new use cases which our existing notions of content ownership simply haven't had to deal with before.<p>The solution will be through some mix of better technology (i.e. smarter scanning algorithms), better modeling of the problem domain (maybe the next version of YouTube's Content ID program will address the issue of situations like this), and changing social and legal norms.<p>In the long term, I believe that one day, people, businesses, laws, and private agreements like ToS will work out an equilibrium where expectations of ownership and use are clear to everyone, penalties are considered reasonable and proportionate to offenses, are enforced consistently with few false positives or negatives, and people mostly manage to get along -- in contrast to the current free-for-all environment where none of these things are true.<p>Unfortunately, ""the long term"" may be very long -- I'd say 30-60 years.  Also, while my assessment may sound positive on first reading, the previous paragraph actually leaves substantial space for very distopian scenarios -- where (for example) permanent ownership is considered reasonable, fair use no longer exists, the expectation is that copyright violators will be jailed, financially ruined, and/or permabanned from the Internet, those penalties are swiftly and surely enforced by extremely invasive monitoring of all computer activity, and anyone who tries to make waves about the situation is dismissed by the media establishment as a fringe lunatic, and can't effectively organize due to the intense restrictions on the Internet.",1344483350

For example the rules for registering a USPS P.O. box are very stringent:<p>> To rent a PO Box, two different forms of identification are required. At least one of them must be a valid photo ID. [1]<p>This way they can actually track you down if you have something illegal shipped to the box.<p>A service like this where you can easily sign up without properly verifying your identity is just waiting to be used as a temporary drop-box for people shipping drugs from SilkRoad, people shipping goods they bought with a stolen credit card, etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-office_box#United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-office_box#United_States</a>",1344481416

They said his resignation, <i>effective immediately</i>, had nothing to do with any disagreement over company operations. It had everything to do with that. He was probably fired or quit in anger over his demotion, due to his (perceived) poor performance.<p>How they can get away with lying to the SEC and their investors like that boggles the mind - but it is how every company handles it. Firings are all resignations and they never have anything to do with the company or the former employees job performance. Everybody leaves as friends that have the upmost respect for one another and can't wait to work together again blah blah they just want to spend time with their kids. That they just drove their company into the ground is a complete coincidence.",1344481228
