What's changed in the US over the last few decades is the ratio of administrators to students.  I don't remember the exact numbers, but it went from something like 1 in 9 to 1 in 3.  Colleges will simply have to make due without the third assistant to the vice dean in charge of diversity and lower the tuition they charge to new students.<p>Fewer people will get degrees, of course.  Some courses of study are investment, and some courses of study are consumption.  You'll see a drop in the consumption degrees, since those people could only get jobs by continuing on to get a law degree.  There aren't any jobs for newly minted lawyers right now.<p>I would like to see the law changed so colleges can't ask about your family's finances.  The kind of perfect price discrimination they practice would be flatly illegal in any other industry.  Imagine going to a car dealer and having him tell you ""Well, the list price for a new car is $100k. But if you turn over all your financial information, you know, how much your family's house is worth and how much your parents make, we'll adjust the price of the car so you can just barely afford it.""",1343983744

(the robin round system)<p>The Point made in favor of the decision to suspend them: The players were suspended as they were ""Not giving one's best effort"" despite warning from the referee in at least one case.<p>Though I partially agree with both of the points, I feel, that though the decision was right, but the logic behind it wasn't!<p>My logic: There is a thin line between ""strategy"" and ""abuse of rules"", in this case, it was clearly the later one, because it was morally and sportingly incorrect to use the rules in such a abusive manner.<p>(mind that, I don't usually make decision based on morals, but this time, my heart (morals) and my brain (logic) are pointing in the same direction. )<p>In simple words, not giving your best against (lets say) your friend at the local court, would make him angry, since it is morally as well sportingly invalid to do so.<p>Now what I'm trying to point is this:<p>Was their decision right: YES<p>Was their logic (official reason) right: NO<p>So by giving this example, I want to share one of my personal sayings:<p>"" Your decision does matters, but what matters more is how you get to that decision.

4333062,comment,4332621,4332621,13,0,_delirium,,,"One thing missing in this analysis is the contribution of more stingy state funding to the decrease in affordability of public universities. For example, the University of California is actually cheaper per-student now to operate than it was in 1990, by about 25%: if you take the total budget, divide by total students, and adjust both numbers for inflation, the result now considerably lower. And that increased overall efficiency comes even despite an increase in administrators.<p>So if the per-student budget is lower, why are per-student fees much higher, rather than 25% lower? Well, the state portion of the funding has declined even faster: from $16,500 per student to somewhere in the $8-9k range in the upcoming budget (inflation-adjusted). So tuition has gone up to compensate.<p>The situation differs at different universities, but in the UC system it's close to being a dollar-for-dollar replacement of declining state funding by increased tuition.",1343981262

In the past, when voice was all anyone cared about, we had a relatively competitive market.  Features such as rollover minutes, family plans, and much more were offered.<p>For example, I have a 300 minute plan, but have maxed out at 5000 minutes now because I simply don't talk on the phone ( Rollover ).  Maybe in the past, this  was different and cost them more to send data across the wire  but now it is the same, voice data and ""data"" data moves across the same pipes as far as I know.<p>If the telco's had to be competitive when it was voice only and data was a luxury and if data and voice are no different  why are the telco's having such a hard time with this?<p>If a plan has 300 minutes of talk time, how about I get 300MB of data time.  If I don't use it all, then give me rollover data just like they do with voice.<p>These telco's basically have one competitor, that being the cable company.  From what I understand, DSL had new subscriber counts that were so low I was shocked something like a few thousand new accounts in total.<p>If they want to compete with cable, right now, they can't, but as soon as their speeds come in-line with cable, they have the potential to be your phone and internet.  And unlike cable, who only sends out one bill, the telco gets to send out a bill to every single person.  Now, everyone has their own Internet connection and is paying for it.<p>From what I understand, telco's are paying pennies per GB on this data from their upstream.  Places like Netflix drop the data as close to their doorstep as possible, at which point, there is zero bandwidth cost for the ISP to shuffle those bits around to users.  If I use all of my 500GB a month, that costs the cable co. well under a dollar in upstream fees.  Yes, they have overheads with their equipment and business operations, but that can't possibly amount to the overage fee's they charge, let alone the fact it costs me $70.00 a month or more for a decent Internet connection.<p>They are going to over-charge themselves out of the game.  As soon as wifi is ubiquitous and phones learn how to jump from one AP to another, things will get interesting.  If I were closer, there is an ISP called Sonic that is bringing 1 Gbps symmetric Fiber to people's homes for a very reasonable fee, around $50.00 a month I believe.<p>Look at AT&T and SMS messages.  Apple releases iMessage, making there no need for SMS for iPhone to iPhone users.  But I still have to keep SMS running for those people who don't have an iPhone. Apple could solve a lot of this by opening up iMessage so others can use the protocol which I believe Steve Jobs said was supposed to happen.  If Android could talk to iPhone over iMessages, it would wake up the telco's very quick.  The only remaining need would be the tweekers and their pay as you go phones, and banks, credit cards, and other pure txt services that send alerts.  Though they could simply put in an iMessage gateway but I have a feeling that would take years for them to implement.",1343981197
