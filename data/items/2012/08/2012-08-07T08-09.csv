Not so much in the sense of onward and upward, but in the sense of helping people feel that this aspect of their life has meaning and direction.",1344329969
4349282,comment,4349177,4349177,24,0,patio11,,,"This article is <i>amazingly</i> worth your time.  Endorsement out of the way I have one quibble and some elaboration:<p>I don't exactly love conflating buyer's remorse with payment fraud, since buyer's remorse is a psychological phenomenon and happens independently of fraudulent intent.  Then again that's a bit hairsplitting.<p>So, you're a digital goods business.  What can you do to reduce the odds that a customer requests a transaction get reversed, given that the customer initially did authorize the transaction?<p>1)  <i>Do nothing.</i>  Treat this as a cost of doing business.  This works astounding well for many client populations, which have naturally low refund rates.  (I'll give you a refund for any reason whatsoever, and I give out substantially less than 2%.  Not worth optimizing.)<p>But maybe you've made the decision to target poor customers, startups, infovores (they buy more books/videos/etc on X than they can consume or make effective use of, and have disproportionately high refund rates), or an audience demographically dissimilar to American housewives.  OK, we still have options:<p>2)  Add value to the one-time download by, e.g., providing a support channel gated on having an account in good standing.  Note that this also lets you do fantastically lucrative things like e.g. the club model for digital goods (recurring payment for one-time downloads), which e.g. put WooThemes on the map.<p>3)  For infovore-heavy niches, many people will suggest forcing delayed gratification on the customer.  For example, let's say you have just sold someone 5 videos / ebooks / etc with expected consumption time of 2 hours each.  Rather than hitting them with 10 hours of video all at once, you drip them out to the user at 2 hours per week for 5 weeks.  This can be timed such that they don't get the final video until after your money-back guarantee expires.  That's totally optional, though.  The theory is that a) you avoid overwhelming people and b) getting in their inbox 5 times with announcements of <i>even more value they got from you</i> helps to prevent a common problem of ""Oh, didn't actually have enough time to read/watch/act on that <i>because I totally forgot to make that time</i>, guess I should return it.""<p>4)  A lot of savvier folks in this space have customer communities where a) the interaction between customers adds value on top of the product, b) desire to maintain the interaction incentivizes people to not leave, and c) customers will (for their own reasons) do significant amounts of boring work for free, such that you don't have to add a not-so-lucrative ""Infinite free support"" sideline to a lucrative digital goods business.<p>5)  Too late for you now, but for the benefit of everyone else, a great way to avoid getting emails by someone whining about getting a refund for the $8 they spent on your ebook is to never ever ever ever ever do business with people at the $8 price point.  SearchHN [patio11 pathological customers] for more on this.",1344329897

If you added in landing rockets and their fuel as well it would be well over double the mass of a Viking lander, so the force of the landing rockets and therefore dust agitation would be commensurately greater.<p>Another advantage of a skycrane is that the rockets need to angled away from the payload anyway, and so the point where the plumes hit the surface is some distance from the payload, whereas rockets in the payload itself would hit the ground immediately below or to the side of it.

This will probably never change, so it can be a static HTML file. This means that you can go nuts using precise HTML to get a really great visual layout for the page without worrying about the client butchering it in some horrible js WYSIWYG editor.<p>What they probably do want to edit/update frequently is information on their selection of bagels. Here you can simply create some basic forms with names like ""add a tasty bagel"" and some very specific fields (for example: suitable for vegans [x]). Writing this code is generally very straightforward if you have a decent ORM. I once turned around a complete website in under 4 hours using nothing but scaffold controllers, some stock art and an off the shelf template.<p>I generally find that using this approach , clients are a lot more engaged with their website and actually update it more than if you simply throw wordpress and a bunch of plugins at them. Since they will inevitably forget how to use it or break something and then call you up to make tiny changes.",1344326869
