If you take a look at a program in the adobe suite, you'll normally notice two things. First, that using the program with the mouse generally involves awkward mouse manoeuvrings. However, keyboard shortcuts can eliminate 90% of this.<p>Third, do you personally recommend using a trackball? I've been experiencing some mild wrist pain lately and am looking for something better than a mouse.",1346392741

The reality is getting hearing aids and still not being able to use the phone to do phone interviews. And having people insist on it anyway.

It's being passed over for promotions because you can't be trusted to hear important things. And nobody can see any of it happening. Except you.<p>That's the real story. A little piece of it.

We all have choices:<p>You can buy Apple and use the iOS app store, you can buy Apple and jailbreak, you can buy dozens of different Android phones and use a number of different Android stores many of which are curated beyond what Apple does, you can buy WP7 and use that store (also heavily curated), you can buy a Blackberry and use that store (also curated), etc.<p>Everyone knows why Samsung got sued, even Google told them to change their design.  Motorola sued Apple first and Apple sued HTC first.  Nokia sued everyone before any of that but somehow only Apple is the big bad that's taken away everyone's ability to buy non-Apple phones.",1346389531

I love hearing about ideas how to introduce programming to people without cs background, nor (I assume) any prior interest in software development. I liked the part about communication - that's something they never teach at the universities. Btw, what did you use for editting? Some sort of an IDE, or maybe something lighter? For begimners I've always thought something like notepad++ or gedit should be enough (for the sake of syntax highlighting, wchich makes code so much prettier).",1346389343
