Many of the most promising new sci-fi writers, like Hugh Howey or Matthew Mather, are publishing their stories piecemeal as short-form ebooks. Howey's ""Wool"" series, in particular, might be the best body of science fiction I've read in years.<p>When you follow these new authors, you definitely notice how much they grow as writers and thinkers as they release new works every month or two. Contrast this to the old model, in which an author would agonize over a single manuscript for years and years, hoping against hope to get a bite from a publisher. I think the new incentives for serial publishing are helping these new players rapidly perfect their craftjust like the classic sci-fi authors of the Golden Age. Thanks to ebooks, we may be getting a new crop of authors to match some of those old giants.",1345607693

My sole concern in that area would be geared towards wanting a free one. Personally, I wouldn't buy one I wouldn't be happy to pay the full price for, and of course my brain sees it as very unlikely that this would be the least popular. Also, it seems a poor gamble to go for one I like less on the hope that I might get another free. So if i picked the least popular, my reaction would just be 'bonus, free tee!' (i wouldn't have any feeling of 'special unique little flower', either).<p>As for the language specifically, firstly, 'least popular' is functional. It tells me exactly what you are talking about. If i read 'most unique' i would have no idea how you were measuring that, and would probably feel uneasy about it-- like you were using the phrase as cover to pick whatever you wanted to. (Which is funny, since 'least popular' is already the best financial option for yous!). Secondly, it doesn't seem too negative to me (compare 'least awesome' vs 'worst'). That is for the landing page (and if any commiseration email), anyway. As far as congratulatory email, I would probably agree to frame it as 'most unique'.<p>Hope that helps!..

Imagine a more general contest: build my company a tool that increases our market value by X%; we'll give the winners $Y and a job interview. The expected value of participating is $Y/n, where n is the number of participants.<p>It's like the opposite of a professional organization. I suppose the libertarians approve. It drives down the cost of labor and therefore might make the market more efficient. Yet I'm suspicious.<p>I'd like to propose a counter-organization. Analysts can band together and offer a contest. We collaborate to create a tool that gives your company an X% increase in value. Companies bid for the rights to that tool. I'd expect that the value to the laborer would be greater than $Y/n. I guess that just described a consulting company.<p>Perhaps the situation is not so unique. Art also provides much value in the act of production and many organizations hold art contests similar in design to Kaggle competitions. Open-source software often doesn't even have a competition sponsor.<p>It'd be ludicrous to imagine holding a contest to offer the best legal advice or diagnosis.

They do not need to have made a lifelong personal commitment to their manager to find those reasons. Also, people do not need to have made that commitment in order to access their unprofessional self; normal team members find ways to be deeply unprofessional without entangling their relationships into their companies.<p>Yes. Strictly speaking, if you get into business with your significant other, you are increasing the cardinality of the set of things that can go wrong with your team. For people that think like us, maybe that's where you stop thinking, and if so, fine.

You can multitask heavily and still be very efficient.  I grew up with CLI's, so I view a good one as a pleasure to use, not a hindrance as some do. Customizability is nearly infinite.  It's generally less work for me to get a Linux box set up to acceptable productive levels than a Windows box.<p>#2. Windows 7:  This runs my HTPC and I use it for games, movies, etc..  There's pretty much no decent Bluray support on any non-MS OS, and I do like bluray!  Win7 still has some bugs, but it's a very livable OS.<p>#3. Windows XP: Yup.  Ancient!  However, a lot of our lab gear has drivers that won't work in anything else. I use it because I have to.<p>OS's I have used and am glad not to anymore:<p>OSX. I had OSX on my laptop for most of last year.  It's nice in that it has better interoperability with Linux software than Windows thanks to it's BSD roots, but if you want to use Linux you might as well use Linux!.  It technically has virtual desktops, but management is primitive.  I've never liked the OSX dock (Give me KBar or even the Win95 start-bar any day!).  Bluray support (one third-party app that does key management over the internet!) is dodgy and gaming is still not so good, so it's not really a viable HTPC OS.  Lion was also <i>very</i> buggy.  Much worse than Windows 7.  Customizability is the worst of any modern OS.  Apple tries very hard to force you to do things their way.  Oh, you can change things, but it's usually more trouble than its worth.  I expect the OS's I use to be capable of adapting to me rather than forcing me to adapt to them.  OSX is ahead of the game when it comes to trackpad gesture support, but hopefully other OS's will catch up fast.",1345606866

It's similar to previous social news sites, but different in a couple key ways.[1] Reddit was originally called a ""del.icio.us clone"" but now we call things reddit clones. There's some ick-factor from the way that content is copied from reddit and elsewhere, but that really goes both ways.<p>2) It's pretty clear how 9gag makes money: paid placements. Unlike reddit it doesn't appear to have a strong anti-commercial taboo. If it can grow big enough, it will make money.  Remember: Facebook is already quite profitable (by the billions!) just not profitable enough to justify at $100 billion valuation yet. So this objection makes no sense to me.<p>3) Facebook was a HUGE success from the point of view of pretty much every investor except people who bought for the ""pop"" right after the IPO. Every VC investor in Facebook did great. Maybe they IPO'd above their true value, but it's still a $40 billion company. That's larger than 99.99% of all companies that get started.
