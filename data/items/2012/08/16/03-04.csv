If they interviewed him, and he still refused to return, then that would be a textbook case of a justification for having him charged in absentia.<p>Secondly, he claims that he will be extradited to the US if he is brought to Sweden. How exactly would he suddenly become more likely to try to flee if they decide to charge him? He is already claiming that going to Sweden means a risk of facing the death penalty in the US.<p>In that context it seems ludicrous to think that interviewing him and then charging him would somehow increase his resolve try to avoid extradition, or that this has been the case for a very long time.<p>It is not like he would have considered voluntarily setting foot on Swedish soil from any point over the past year or more. A charge would not have made that more or less likely.<p>Meanwhile, a formal charge would remove at least some reason to question the motivations of the Swedish prosecutor, and it would make it much harder for Ecuador to justify asylum given that they have publicly used this as part of their process for determining whether or not to give asylum.<p>As for that. At the moment he is holed up in a small embassy, while the Metropolitan police is outside, waiting for a chance to grab him.<p>Yet the Swedish police still refuse to interview him, while making up bogus excuses for why they don't. They could have stated the reason you suggest: That if they make the decision to charge him, they want to be able to take him into custody immediately under the circumstances. That reason is still a poor excuse, but they've not even tried to use even that.<p>If he is a flight risk in his current location, he is a flight risk whether or not they interview or charge him - his only realistic means of escape is if he gets asylum from Ecuador and Ecuador finds a way of getting him on a plane, whether smuggling him in an oversized diplomatic pouch or convincing the UK to give him free passage. Either way, this doesn't become any harder or easier depending on whether or not Swedish authorities interview him.<p>The Swedish might not be the <i>only ones</i> acting irrationally. But if they're not acting irrationally, it would imply they have a hidden agenda. If their agenda is what they claim it is, then yes, they are acting irrationally.

Then shortly afterwards, Swedish military intelligence uncovered that it was still ongoing with the knowledge of airport personnel. At least officially without the knowledge of the Swedish government.<p>Maybe they've stopped now. Or maybe the units that participated in it are just better at hiding it, or maybe the US government is just better at making sure said Swedish government units have better reasons to deny knowledge.<p>But the fact remains that for sveral years, the US extracted prisoners from and/or transported prisoners through Sweden illegally to hand them over to regimes that would carry out torture in violation of both US and Swedish law and international treaties, with the complicit knowledge of the Swedish government.<p>It's quite possible the UK did too.

The electronic disk ejection mechanism was very cool. The battery life was unheard of. The was a button for every function, and every function could be messed with. I remember keeping the language in Japanese and the eerie blue backlight on the remote permanently turned on so that it looked cool.<p>But at the time it was released Apple had released the iPod. Basically a tiny HDD and audio decoder hidden under a simple user interface and simple human-machine-interface. All it did was play music, and it could store a lot of it for a little over half the price of the MZ-N10. Instead of being encrusted with a myriad of buttons, it relegated the functionality to the user interface. Simplicity through clever software.<p>Since then every Japanese gadget I've purchased has suffered from the same problem - excellent engineering but poor user-interface. The one exception being my Canon image stabilised binoculars which have exactly one button and a focus ring.
