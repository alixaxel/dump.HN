A hijacked airplane won't make it off the ground, and if the bomber is on the ground, what's the big deal? You can't prevent suicide bombings from happening <i>everywhere</i>, so it makes sense to focus the effort on where the damage would be particularly bad (e.g. 1 WTC). A bomb at the airport on the ground doesn't seem worse than Times Square.",1345449553

4406659,comment,4405987,4406157,6,0,quotemstr,,,"Bitcoin has deflation baked into the system. Deflation is _terrible_ for the economy because it encourages people to hide cash under mattresses instead of spending it on useful projects. (Or in more abstract terms, deflation raises the minimum viable rate of return on investment.) We've learned this lesson well. All the really terrible depressions --- the 1870s, the 1930s --- featured crippling deflation that kicked the economy while it was already down. When Williams Jennings Bryan seared ""you shall not crucify mankind on a cross of gold"", he was talking about how using gold for money kept inflation too low and hurt ordinary people in the economy. (Bryan's ""free silver"" movement would have been inflationary and beneficial.)<p>One important thing stopping the current depression from being as catastrophic as the great depression is the policy of the Federal Reserve (which is hugely influenced by Goldman Sachs) of printing money and keeping interest rates at 0%. If they didn't do that, we'd be far worse off right now.<p>So yes, as far as regulating the money supply goes, I'd trust the directors of Goldman Sachs over some algorithm any day, especially when that algorithm seems to have been designed by people with a very dogmatic theory of value, a theory that history demonstrates is incompatible with happiness.",1345449367

4406657,comment,4404697,4404697,1,0,ioquatix,,,"[I tried to post this as a comment, but Zed decided to delete it :/]<p>I think your comparison between for loops and .each is flawed - clearly you don't need to explain all those concepts in detail if at all. A for loop ultimately involves some level of polymorphism on the target collection, at least to the same level as required by the call to .each. I'd say that conceptually they are very similar, with both constructs having specific differentiating features.<p>Also, .each doesn't eventually become a for-loop in C code. 1/ Neither Ruby nor Python are compiled to C code, and 2/ I wouldn't expect that the respective looping constructs become a typical C for loop, it is more likely they will be implemented in the native op-code (e.g. CPython, Ruby 1.9).<p>With respect to why .each is fundamental to Ruby, we clearly see some key differences between Python and Ruby in this respect. I think the critical thing is that Ruby tends towards being a functional language while Python tends to be more imperative. We can see this clearly in the types of operations provided by Python, for example, list.reverse() in Ruby returns a copy of the list in reverse order, but in Python it reverses the list in place.<p>Using .each in Ruby code leads to shorter more concise code in contrast to the corresponding Python code. Whether you feel that you are being judged or not (in a social sense) is probably a matter of who you choose to interact with on that level (e.g. a particular developer community). Have you ever had to use non-idomatic C code? How about non-idomatic Python code? Clearly, a big issue with source code is composition (on a project level) and non-idiomatic code causes many issues in this area.<p>It is also interesting to note that non-idomatic behaviour plays a role in larger society. For example, choose the GPL and you might receive some complaints from communities that typically use MIT or BSD license. How about real life? If your friend buys you a drink and you don't play the social ""ball game"" (e.g. behave non-idomatically) you might have social problems in that area too.<p>I think that ultimately you are confusing a social interaction with a programming language best practice. I don't think either of these things are bad - heck, look at all the company specific coding standards for C or C++ code - but ultimately whether you choose to indoctrinate your students into a particular social circle, or teach them the best practice for a given programming language is simply a matter of perspective; and empowering your students to understand why things are the way they are, rather than simply saying this is the way we've always done things, is ultimately something I think is very important.",1345449160

4406655,comment,4405890,4405890,8,0,veidr,,,"I agree that the The Future is not Real-Time, but I don't really think these are new phenomena (neither real-time technologies, nor the fact that they aren't The Future).<p>It's probably mostly just my age (37), but I feel like these things come and go on a cycle.<p>My first brush with realtime was having a pager in high school. Wow neat, my friends can get ahold of me even when I am out in the streets! Huh, lame, all these people have my pager number now, and it beeps all the time and I never know if it is worth calling back.<p>Then came ICQ. Most of my friends and college classmates were all over that shit. I never understood it: text chat only seemed interesting to me late at night when I was too stoned (or whatever) to focus on anything. It combined the annoying immediacy of a phone call with 10% of the communications bandwidth of actual conversation.<p>Then I got a cell phone, but by that time we had caller ID and other people had cell phones (as opposed to the pay phones that had been calling my pager), and so it was only a minimal intrusion because just glancing at it told me that I didn't need to take that call right now (95% of the time).<p>So it wasn't too annoying, until the phones started to bleat our plaintive little demands to read the ""text messages"" that they had become capable of. I disabled the service.<p>Eventually we got to where we have data service and pocket computers everywhere. (I love that btw.) So now tons of people are pecking out little bleeps on facebook and twitter pretty much constantly. I don't really get this behavior any more than I got ICQ.<p>I like reading realtime twitter bleeps, say, <i>when I search for something</i>, or perhaps when I go on twitter to read stuff (if I did that), but why would I want them at other times?<p>I feel like Clifford Stoll, sometimes, ranting in my cabin in the woods about how e-commerce is never gonna catch on. Especially when somebody ""pokes"" me on facebook. (Thankfully, I only see that when I log on every month or so to see my sister's latest baby pictures.) But... what does that even <i>mean</i>? Why would I want people to be able to ""poke"" me? Whenever they want? And seemingly purposefully devoid of any content other thank the fact of poking me? Crazy!<p>So I fully admit that I don't get this latest round of 'realtime', but the solutions are still the same as the last times realtime came around. Just arrange to deal with information on your <i>own</i> time.<p>You want your machines to get data in realtime; sure, why not? And it will be cool if, in the future, we do indeed ""find ways to artificially stem the constant flow of information through algorithmic summarization.""<p>But there's a simpler, manual way to stem the constant flow of demands on your time: just reject them, and deal with them later, at your own convenience, or perhaps never.<p>What exactly is it that makes that hard for some people to do?",1345448898

4406653,comment,4406224,4406224,2,0,Tichy,,,"It's just that Java is very verbose, and actually I found it particularly horrible for data driven applications (by this I mean apps whose behavior is determined by data/config files, not ""Big Data"" - I have no experience with the latter). For complex data types you always need to create complex class hierarchies. In other languages you could just write<p>webInfo = {url: ""bla.bla"", title: ""bla die blub"", links: [""link1"", ""link2""]}<p>Notice that webInfo contains two different types, Strings and Arrays. In Java arrays or hashes you can not easily mix types - you'll end up just putting objects everywhere, then be forced to litter the code with type casts. Or you create the unwieldly class hierarchy. That is my prediction, anyway - I am too lazy to come up with a good example :-(<p>You can also not simply write something like the hash above. The nearest you can get is if you have created that class hierarchy with suitable constructors, you could instantiate that in one go. At least that is my memory - I have now avoided it for so long that I am not even sure how to instantiate an Array or a Hash with data on the fly anymore.<p>I think instantiating an array with data goes something like<p>links = new String[]{""bla"", ""blub""}, and there is nothing like that for Hashes - you are stuck with<p>info = new HashMap()<String, Object>;//generics are particularly ugly and annoying<p>info.put(""links"", new String[]{""bla"", ""blub""});<p>info.put(""title"", ""some stupid web site"");<p>info.put(""url"", ""undisclosed"");<p>And so on - a far cry from the example above. (Note the Java syntax is probably wrong, created from memory - but it is something like that).<p>Even if you went through the mind numbing work of creating appropriate classes, you'd be stuck with<p>info = new WebInfo(title, url, new String[]{link1, link2,...});<p>And that is just for two different types, and notice that there is no way to see what the name of the parameters of the WebInfo constructor actually are from that snippet of code.<p>title: someTitle<p>is actually much more readable because you can instantly see that someTitle is supposed to be a title.<p>Also if you want to use NoSQL, I suspect converting java classes to JSON could be a pita, too.",1345448725

But more importantly, note this part of your quote: ""<i>hasn't been in so much as a scuffle since primary school</i>"". What, exactly, do you feel you need to defend yourself against? You want to bring sidearms into a nation to protect yourself from 'not so much as a scuffle since primary school'?

It's not something that is peculiar to the Australian psyche.<p>But yes, around nightclub districts there is a problem. Even your linked article it's talking about the heart of a nightclub district at 2:30am. But in reality street crime is no worse here than anywhere else. I think you're falling into the trap that Australians so like to fall into, claiming that the country is always going downhill and is worse than anywhere. It's like the people that claim our country is the most racist in the world. Sure, we have some problems with racism, but what countries don't? Whenever we have these discussions, there's almost never any actual comparison to contemporary countries - it's habit for us just to assume we're the worst (because like the US, we like to think we're #1, it seems :)<p>It's actually really hard to accurately compare crime directly between countries (excluding homicide). A punch-on between a couple of guys can end up with five charges being laid in Australia (ascending charges, one of them will stick), and is listed as 5 charges in the stats. NZ does this as well, but not many other places do. In contrast the US doesn't even bother publishing those stats, they'll generally only publish <i>aggravated</i> assaults, which are with either a weapon or resulting in severe injury.",1345448125

Once again the point is that if you want to learn how to program in a specific language, you need to understand it's concepts and patterns. It's akin to the fact that if you want to learn how to build a car, you need to understand it's mechanics. You can easily take whatever you find in the internet and build a program. Or you could tweak an example to do something else without another care in the world. Guess what? You still don't understand what's happening or why, and because of that the end product will most probably be defective in some way. You still don't know what the point is, you only know that it works. That's OK if you need a quick solution for a small problem, but it's not when your goal in itself is to learn how to program (in Ruby)...<p>Go ahead and read Zed's article again, only this time do so slowly and with care. Come back and realize two very important things you seem to be missing:<p>A) This is Zed's opinion about TEACHING a programming language. TEACHING being the keyword. If you want to learn a programming language, you inherently need to understand it. As a small aside, he did write ""Learn Python The Hard Way"" which was pretty much a success, but don't believe me... he's probably a troll as you say.<p>B) The discussion is basically that a form of writing a specific block of code is easier to explain than another, although the latter is more widely used and considered the correct. Readability, though important, has little to do with choosing the correct construct to teach as to provide a good balance of the time and effort you need to put into learning.<p>You want to keep going with the analogies? You shouldn't drive a manual transmission car if you've only driven automatics, the same way you shouldn't deploy code to your clients that you've figured out will give you the results you want when you've never understood what the program is doing on the first place because you made assumptions when you started.",1345447342

The Java language is perfectly fine: high performance, statically typed, OOP, relatively simple and maintainable. It may not offer the most concise code and it may not have all the ""trendy"" language syntax features but guess what - that actually doesn't matter much in the real world (i.e. outside the realm of language designers and fanboys). If saving a few characters of typing is your major concern when choosing a language, you have much bigger problems.<p>But the real strength in Java is not the language but rather the overall platform - the combination of the JVM (which is an amazing high performance feat of engineering), the library ecosystem (which is the best overall for any language), the tools (great IDEs, Maven, a host of other developer-focused tools), the fact that the OpenJDK itself and most of the libraries are open source and the portability (compiled JVM code is extremely portable, and importantly doesn't need a recompile unlike some other so-called ""cross-platform"" languages)<p>So overall you can't really go wrong with choosing Java for server side applications. Although I would also give Clojure or Scala a look - if you are after ""powerful"" languages then these two are pretty amazing and you still get all the benefits of being on the Java platform.",1345446452
