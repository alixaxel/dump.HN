They enter delivery details and are tracked by a centralised computer.<p>Given this couldn't the central computer take the driver's current location and call/text the customer with an <i>estimated</i> delivery time that's going to likely be within a half-hour error window (closer I'd think in town). The logisticians must have a pretty good idea of the timing for a route after all.<p>So when you sign up you'd ask to be notified n hours before delivery. Once the route is calculated, with say n=1, if you're first drop then you'd have a call/text (1 hour) - (first leg duration) before the driver starts their round.<p>Wouldn't such a system reduce delivery failures, anyone know of a company that's tried such automated delivery notifications based on routing data?

Sorry - I can't hold back this time. Here's my context for reading this app.net post:<p>Twitter works in the same way the old AOL client did: you accessed some message boards and stock prices and film websites using AOL keywords. Marketers flocked to AOL to put up the latest movie premier website.<p>At the same time there was the small techno-elite downloading Mosaic 0.98 over their SLIP connection and starting to experiment with the ""world wide web"". In comparison with the closed systems like Compuserve and AOL, the open web took much longer to evolve becasue everybody was working on different parts without any central coordination. It was this lack of central coordination that brougt us a more robust system and I don't think that any of us will argue for a world where AOL is the gold standard of finding, hosting and accessing content.<p>Twitter is pushing hard to be the gold standard of messaging in the same way that AOL did. And are marketers flocking to work with Twitter along with newscasters giving out hashtags and @twitter-names.<p>But, in the backrooms and basements and hackerspaces of the internet, today's equivalent of Mosaic downloaders are experimenting with open, distributed social networks like buddycloud.<p>The buddycloud team and everyone who attends our hackathons that are working to build the post-Twitter future just like Netscape helped launch the open web.<p>The future will not be build around one company, but a couple of companies like buddycloud can help nudge it forward.

""Metasyllabus Initiative"": This is a generic Wordpress site using a contributed theme. I assume this is your first attempt at a personal blog. There doesn't appear to be anything technically special about it, and it hasn't been updated in 8 months. If you stick with web development, get used to that. I haven't updated my blog in a year and a half. Wordpress is great, though, because anyone can set it up and use it. Anyone.<p>2. ""Decision Tree Generator"": About as simple as it can get. An independent multi-page Javascript-dependent (Did you learn that on W3Schools?) post form that's easily broken and seems to offer very little utility to the user. The most complicated styling used in this project is probably the absolute-positioned results.<p>3. ""OmicronAlpha.org"": This site is down.<p>4. ""www.sagegerard.com"": I don't know any serious web developers who would use Concrete5, and the comments I've received even from novices about it (it seems to appeal primarily to novices) have all ended with disappointment.<p>My point is that you're still a beginner. As a beginner, you don't know as much as the people you're arguing with, and you're making yourself look a bit foolish. W3Schools is a fine resource for anyone who knows that it's often unsafe, inaccurate, and wrong. However, the people who know that don't use W3Schools. My biggest problems with W3Schools (other than the inaccurate information) are that 1) they don't explain that they are not associated in any way with the W3C and 2) they sell overpriced certifications that require a user <i>learns</i> inaccurate information.<p>I read an article a few years ago (that I'm not possibly going to look for now) about best practices when creating examples and guides. The most important lesson in the article was that you should almost never show wrong examples or antipatterns. I.e., don't show an example of what NOT to do. The reason was that the novice ends up remembering the wrong examples as often (or possibly more often) as the good examples. At that point, the example/guide has failed. That's what W3Schools does. They can add as many disclaimers to their site as they want, but that doesn't change the result. They aren't just not doing as much to help people as they could. They're doing harm to the internet.<p>And by the way, the second sentence of your blog post is both ambiguous and wrong. Was W3Fools created in 2008 (It wasn't.)? Or did W3Fools teleport back in time to only criticize a 2008 version of W3Schools (They didn't.)?",1344503103
