Lots of interest, we're in advanced due diligence with a couple of very large banks and expect the first sales and rapid growth in the next couple of months. So far, so good.<p>We were toying with looking for some angel investment, and about eight weeks ago were introduced to a local angel investor. After a a few meetings and lunches he came up with the following offer:<p>- Investor puts in 200k in return for 20% of the company. Rather more than I wanted to part with but OK as a starting point for negotiation.<p>- Investor promises to help drive company growth as he has contacts and experience, wants to be involved. Not ideal as we have no idea how he'd perform - in a two-man startup we can't carry a third person who wants to help.<p>- Investor requires the company to pay him back the 200k at 12% interest rate, personal guarantees no doubt required but I didn't stick around long enough to ask.<p>The reason the offer was interesting was the light in which it showed the investor. To make such a bizarre offer (basically, to lend us money at a crazy rate, and in addition to demand a large chunk of the company in return for the unproven value he said he could add) made me ask: what would he be like to deal with on a day-to-day basis?<p>We walked away.<p>What other crazy offers have startup founders seen?",1344840686

But we do have some level of cultural accommodation to and regulation of alcohol. By now we have nearly the same level of facility in dealing with marijuana, which is also a drug of abuse which is not that hard to use safely.<p>But every compound is unique. Taken in the ways they are almost always taken, alcohol and marijuana are pretty mellow and easy to dose and don't have wild side effects like immediately blinding you or shutting down your lungs if you screw up slightly. But they are not the same as each other and neither is the same as datura or belladonna. Many psychoactives are blow-your-head-off powerful tools that should never be used in the casual, vacuous party-time way that our culture likes to do for the last 60 years or so. And many, it's just prudent never to use at all.<p>Heroin is (or was) legal for UK hospitals to use in killing pain and I believe in its usefulness for that reason. But I am not going to defend high-dose, party-time heroin use as a reasonable and prudent practice any more than I am going to defend promiscuous, unprotected sex with many HIV+ individuals (which also has a very surprisingly low  per-instance probability of doing anything - yet that is exactly how it continues to spread and ruin people's lives).<p>In any case, saying 'alcoholism is also bad' is certainly not a reason to suppose that heroin addiction is not bad.",1344840024

4374747,comment,4374151,4374630,6,0,slurgfest,,,"Addiction is a valid folk concept: everyone is aware of someone who can't get off cigarettes or booze, for example, or gambling, or occasionally heroin or meth or crack - to the impairment of their life, past the point of ongoing pleasure. So there are real phenomena to study, of some social importance. And I don't dispute that many people lose control and mess up their lives in various ways, in addition  to running afoul of the law. So be careful with drugs, not even once, blah blah blah.<p>But the term 'addiction' does not correspond to any natural scientific category. Because unless it is made impossibly rare and unlike our folk concept, any definition will drag in all routine motivated behavior to the point where a lot is included which we all like and find healthy and normal.<p>There is no actual distinction between 'physiological dependence' and 'psychological addiction.' The relevant phenomena are all psychological and all have biological basis - just as one's behavioral responses to hunger, dehydration, embarrassment or sexual arousal do. Avoiding withdrawal might be more or less motivating depending on the drug - for example, cocaine doesn't really have much of a withdrawal compared to heroin. But the fundamental reason people use heroin isn't because of withdrawal, it's because they love it. The situation where one takes heroin simply to avoid symptoms is just not the primary mechanism of heroin addiction. And since heroin is the paradigm case for this kind of explanation, it is just generally not a good one. We have confused the different phenomenology of the cravings with a spurious major distinction between physical and ghostly causes, when we should really be considering the specific neural systems which are engaged by the different drugs.<p>I appreciate that what I am saying sounds controversial. If what I say is true, why do people keep talking about addiction? Because the word has an important function OUTSIDE of science - it applies a specific kind of pressure, an important feature of which is the appearance of being scientific. It is an implicit value judgement said in a scientific tone of voice, making it more legally and secularly palatable.<p>Addiction is nothing more than the pathologized version of desire or enjoyment. If you wish to cast shadows on anything people enjoy doing, simply call it an addiction. In particular if you wish to conflate social disapproval of an activity with a scientific judgement of unhealthiness, call the activity an addiction.<p>Suppose, for example, that a certain person goes to a bondage club on a weekly basis... so easy to make this into an addiction. Doing the same thing with 'normal' sex is just significantly harder. (Though still possible - in a situation where someone has an interest in pathologizing sex)",1344839021

(Remember all that ""loss leader"" talk when new consoles come out and are cheaper than what it costs to manufacture them?  This is why.)  By the time everyone gets their slice, you have a pit of dedicated game developers making $15k a year that have put up with distributors telling them what kind of game to make, who then ultimately get fired when they've done their job as commanded.  Seems like a career you'd need to love to stick with it.<p>Even if the numbers don't work out in the end - if OUYA's cut is just as big as the big guys, if the CPU doesn't cut the mustard, if developers can't sell big enough numbers to stay afloat, etc. - it still seems like a worthy enough idea to back it if you're a gamer and want to see what developers could do, free of the shackles of conventional distribution.

For some people who <i>are</i> genetically predisposed to alcoholism, this is exactly what prevents them from drinking, even though it's still legal. Yet, this small chance of being an alcoholic doesn't prevent anyone else from drinking alcohol, so why should it prevent people from doing drugs? It seems as though we run under the foolish assumption that being an alcoholic ""isn't as bad"", without realizing just how bad alcoholism can get.

When I went to the legendary SIGGRAPH 2001 Physically Based Modeling course with David Baraff and the late Andy Witkin, they discussed all the ways we could avoid having our numeric solvers ""blow up"" (basically, when numerical values change too quickly to figure out how to reasonably estimate them). Then Andy somewhat sheepishly mentioned that they don't actually deal with these problems, since their team at Pixar created a direct solver they actually used instead, which solved the many necessary equations symbolically instead of numerically.<p>This was 2001, so few in attendance had the ability to go off and write an effective direct solver for their project even if they had the right background to do it.  So we made do with numeric solvers and patched over occasional blow-ups. That's a picture of how things go. It's not surprising that the pipeline in Emeryville was far more advanced, seeing how Witkin and Baraff created the Maya physics engine as a warm-up for their Pixar system. By now, there are better solvers in many physics systems... yet how much more insanely awesome must Pixar's simulation software be by now?<p>It's easy to see that this kind of software is highly strategic  Pixar hired world experts to work on this and it must be extremely well-seasoned code, with countless tricky ""gotchas"" compensated for. It's not hard to see how that gives them a clear competitive advantage.<p>On the other hand, the potential is enormous. This system is the masterwork, even the life's work, of unbelievably talented people. Erin Catto's work and generosity with Box2D has shown the massive innovation and even cultural value of code like this. How many more amazing things could be created with a simulation engine of the quality Pixar is sitting on?<p>So although I'm not holding my breath, it would be amazing to see even a small part of their physics simulation in a future open source release. Is that realistic? I have no idea.",1344838043

He certainly could have had his hand in the pot but Pixar is under the control of Disney/Catmull & Lasseter.  Jobs/His family are the largest single individual share holder in Disney but its not like he had/has majority say.  If they needed to do this to keep making quality films, even if he was in a particularly bad mood towards OSS (say, Linus decided to say something cheery about OS X), they could tell him to go run his own company.<p>2. Apple, where Steve was clearly king, would open source or give away software at times, likely when it made business sense and not for the sake of brotherly FOSS love. For example: Contributions to KHTML (Webkit) and Clang, and wholly contributed things like libdispatch, Apple Lossless codec, etc[1].<p>I'm pretty sure Pixar's move here would be considered a good business move.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.macosforge.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macosforge.org</a>",1344837712
