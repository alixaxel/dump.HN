4374025,comment,4373764,4373764,2,0,makmanalp,,,"I think what he's missing is that a lot of people are expressing interest in building games and apps for it specifically and maybe exclusively.<p>This addresses the weak point of android and also newly released consoles. New consoles (the wii comes to mind) tend to have a lack of games, which tends to in turn make them less attractive. Android phones are pretty damn good these days but the apps are worse than iOS ones in general, which gives me pause when considering it.<p>Good devices without content suck, and vice versa (maybe a bit less so). So it's all about <i>packaging</i> good content with your good device. I think that's what they are aiming at.",1344815845

(If it's not, then that should be their first priority. But I can't imagine Facebook is running everything they do out of one process).<p>So they could port each service/component one at a time, rigorously testing and improving performance as they go. Then they'd not only get the benefit of a better runtime, but also a safer, faster language. In fact, if they're anything like most companies I know, they're <i>always</i> in the process of rewriting one service or another to improve performance or features, whether in a new language or not. All they'd need to do would be to switch to the new language whenever they were refactoring existing code anyway.<p>Of course I can't make the decision for them, and they are rightly hesitant to do an entire rewrite.

4373974,comment,4372378,4373855,3,0,deno,,,"> The JavaScript context is running an event loop which most likely must perform locking on its message queue and callbacks to async operations are queued for execution on a future tick of this event loop. All of this seems very preemptive to me.<p>Theres a single loop which blocks until the task <i>yields</i> while waiting on the result from one of the worker threads. Thats cooperation. All queued connections are starved until that happens. In Erlang, or just with pthreads, the connections are processed independently. Think separate event loops for each connection.<p>> To me, cooperation is when you yield the thread to another coroutine. This saves the state of the call stack, the registers, everything; meaning you don't force your user to keep that state in closures. The user code in a cooperative environment feels sequential and blocking and results are passed by return values, not by calling continuations.<p>That has noting to do with how execution is scheduled. Cooperative scheduling requires passing continuations[1], so the execution can be resumed while it waits. The simplest implementation is to use callbacks, the way node.js does it. Futures and deferreds[2] are a little bit more sophisticated (Pythons Twisted, probably something for node.js exists as well), as they allow for better composition. And of course you can hide the continuations entirely, which can be done in both Scala (compiler plugin) and Python (gevent or using generators), rewriting the direct control flow by breaking it on yield points automatically (this is how exception throws work in most languages btw), but the limitations inherent in having a single event loop per thread will still exist.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_and_promises</a>",1344814474

4373968,comment,4373117,4373634,3,0,darkandbrooding,,,"What follows is a layman just ""thinking out loud."" (But isn't that what Sunday afternoons are for?) When I use the term ""auditor"" I'm implying ""employees at a firm"" rather than ""a single individual.""<p>What App.net desires is for a trusted third party to say, ""Yep, they're legit."" So first, you would select an auditor who has a good reputation financially, technically, and ethically. Presumably, you'd line up a couple of secondary sources to publicly reinforce the auditor's reputation and bless the auditor's methodology.<p>It's been literally decades since I took any accounting classes, but I think you would <i>need</i> to follow the entire chain of some transactions, and this would necessitate showing real investor/customer data at some point. If you can secure that investor's/customer's permission, then sharing the data becomes a non-issue. How you get that permission becomes the issue.<p>If your auditor's reputation is strong enough, their name alone may be sufficient to secure permission. But you can also take steps to create a ""security narrative"" designed to put the investor/customer at ease.<p>You'd need to give the auditor access to your data, while preventing the possibility that they could leak this data. So the auditor would work in your offices, on your machines.<p>You'd provide laptops so that you can disable all peripheral ports. You'd secure the laptops to the table. The machines would have no optical drives. Those machines would net boot, have wired LAN access but not WAN, and no wireless access at all. They would run the software the auditors required but nothing else.<p>You'd confiscate phones and cameras from the auditors before they entered your audit environment. You could go a little crazy and record video of the auditors at work, with cameras angled so that you can see what notes the auditors are taking but not what screen they're looking at while they're taking notes. You could go a lot crazy and prove that the auditors are not sitting in front of any windows, thereby exposing data to high powered lenses across the street.<p>You could sanitize the data your auditors see, so that the auditor initially sees ""Backer N"" or ""Vendor Y"" instead of an actual person or company name.<p>Armed with some variation of the above security narrative, when the auditor says ""I'd like to talk to backer N or vendor Y,"" you can present that narrative to the backer or vendor to secure their permission for auditor access to the information.

But it's a weird suggestion that students can't add value</i><p>This is a thread from the site, but I'm quoting it here because it's relevant to the discussion about what kind of community app.net will become.  The first two comments make me uneasy: even if there is value in excluding/discouraging people who don't contribute positively-- which is true for a site like Hacker News, but not so much, I think, for a Twitter-like site where you only see the activity of people you follow; the Global stream is an exception, but it'll only take a little more growth before it becomes unusable anyway-- trying to judge from a blank slate whether someone who might sign up for the site is likely to contribute value, especially based on such vague metrics as ""ability to pay $50"" and ""student"", runs the risk of being elitism for the sake of elitism.  For some, $50 is enough of a barrier that they'll only sign up if they're especially interested (a sign that they'll contribute value); for others, it's little more than an impulse purchase.  As for students, I agree that the site should avoid favoring students over people who don't go to college, but as a rather biased student (and backer), I contest the sentiment that students can't contribute value or need to be ""managed"" more than your average slightly older entrepreneur. ;p  Even though age probably weakly correlates with quality, the goal of the site should not be to slightly increase average quality, but, if anything, to ensure that the highest quality users, the right edge of the bell curve, are there, which exclusionary principles will discourage.<p>Of course, the $50 is not actually some kind of proof of relevance but actual funding for the operation of the site; it can't be avoided.  But I think it should mostly be considered a necessary evil, and there should be a focus on letting people who are unwilling to pay it but are strongly interested in the community get in anyway, such as with a sponsorship system.",1344813486

It is just an additional way to share easily photos to them.",1344812567

I have great respect for the JVM, but PHP could simply be replaced by JavaScript for example.<p>It seems easier to me to port PHP to Rhino or node.js than to bring PHP to the JVM.
