I'd say literacy did not decrease, and access to information greatly improved. But if you wanted, you also could find a lot of illiterate people and a lot of ignoramuses, I would even argue it is easier to be an ignoramus now than before.<p>I can see however where that came from - with the rise of the TV culture and not seeing the following rise of the internet and global information connectedness brought by it - you can easily decide that the future is couch potatoes watching TV, not couch potatoes reading blogs and writing comments :)",1344138921

They're the people whose job it is to evaluate startups' prospects, and they care above all about two things: the founders and the market.  The founders should be relentlessly effective, and the market should ideally be of a size that can only be obtained by riding on trends beyond the startup's control (but visible to few besides the founders, or the market would already be full).  Joining the young Microsoft, for example was a bet on Bill Gates and microcomputers, both of which turned out to be very good bets.<p>As a hacker you may be able to judge market bets as well as or better than many investors.  E.g. I think HN readers knew Dropbox was onto something before most investors did.  So if you go wrong it will be in judging founders.  For many hackers, especially the unwordly sort, it's hard to distinguish true Bill Gateses from mere good talkers.<p>I wish I could offer some advice about distinguishing, but that would take a whole essay.  The best simple hack I can think of is completely self-serving, but I'll offer it anyway: piggyback on our filter.  YC specializes in distinguishing between genuine Gateses and good talkers.  We're occasionally fooled, but far less often than a typical hacker looking for a job would be.",1344138771

We are also starting working on an API.<p>It is perfectly OK if you do not have experience with any of the languages or technologies we currently use (Ruby/Rails/JS/MySQL/Solr...) as long as you can learn those quickly.

The best part is he progresses in a methodical way, everything is downloadable in pdf format, and his examples are great.<p>For physics, the Feynman lectures are a great once you have a bit of foundation, but really any course from MIT OpenCourseWare or Coursera will do.  The key is definitely doing examples, and I find it is particularly useful to apply it to real life by asking questions.  Rainbows?  Cameras?  Bubbles?  Spear-fishing?  All great examples of optics.  Deep sea excavations?  Pulling out the Titanic? Diesel-filled bags? Perfect for studying bouyancy and forces.  Have you played Tanks? (seeing as you're in high school, I'm sure you have.  If not, you should!) Projectile motion!  Just keep your eyes open.<p>Since you're doing it on your own, I highly suggest learning physics Calc based, instead of algebra based.  Everything will tie in very nicely, seeing how calculus was apparently invented FOR physics (courtesy of Professor Covault at CWRU).<p>Kudos, and good luck!<p>edit: After trying to use Wikipedia for physics in college, I don't recommend it if you're trying to learn.  They use weird terminology, and sometimes weird notation.  Sometimes it is good for examples though.  Also, check out the International Baccalaureate exams, an alternative to AP.  The main difference is that AP expects lots of breadth and little depth, vs IB is vice versa.  My physics teacher used to say ""IB wants you to be able to answer a question the same way someone with a PhD in the field would"".  You can find practice exams online.  By the way, for Higher Level (HL) exams (equiv to C-level in AP), around a 65% is a 7, the best score you can get.<p>edit2:  Don't forget public libraries!  Especially at large colleges or universities.  They have many textbooks available, even the old ones at times (which I prefer, there's something about picking up an old textbook and learning from it that's not captured anywhere else.  It feels like you're learning from the major players in the game, and I get more motivated to do well).  I'll stop with the edits now.",1344136580

4340468,comment,4340187,4340187,9,0,patio11,,,"The United States has no sales tax, per se.  (There's a few flavors of excise tax at the federal level.)  California, and many municipalities in California, have sales taxes.  They are routinely exacted from people who don't live in California, including (most relevantly by volume) other Americans.  To my knowledge there has never been a serious discussion about tax totalization at either the international or national level because it would be an absolutely <i>mammoth</i> undertaking.  By comparison, in some countries taxes are imposed by the national government, and totalization is virtually automatic within a nation and comparatively easy to arrange for international tourists.  (Also, those nations <i>tend</i> to have much higher taxes, and they've made the decision to rebate them to international tourists so as to encourage them to not go to locales with more favorable tax regimes.)<p><i>What happened to ""No taxation without representation""?</i><p>Not the best analogy, since foreign visitors are ordinarily not entitled to much say in the internal affairs of their host countries and can pick freely from all available tax regimes to purchase their goods from, but a good piece of rhetoric.  You might consider bringing it up with your elected representatives.  I rather suspect that they will be unsympathetic, as the Californian electorate routinely signals that they would rather pay salaries/health care/pensions for state workers than lower taxes on people who don't reside in California.
