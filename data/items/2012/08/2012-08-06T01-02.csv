It is not uncommon for a crew to finish a race sweaty and exhausted and a few hours later meet in a ballroom in black tie attire to go through a procedure that is reminiscent of courtroom proceedings to determine if a rule was broken or if a foul play was involved.<p>A team who we often compete alongside recently outfitted their boat with a multitude of GoPros, one on top of the mast, 2 on the bow looking back on the port and starboard gunnel of the boat, 2 on the back looking forward, and 2 looking out on each side. They not only use these to practice, going over the ""play by play"" if you will, but also during the aforementioned race committee hearings, to establish innocence or wrongdoing. They swear the cameras, which cost them at most $3,000, have won them many a race.<p>GoPro has done a very good job finding the niche they needed to appeal to, and marketing and fueling that niche to be the backbone of what appears to be a very successful business.

I think these provide a lot of insight that you wouldn't have the opportunity to receive via the standard portfolio/github and interview process.

And as a candidate, there have been a couple of time where I've realized via the challenge process, that I wouldn't want to work with a particular group.<p>It's a smart use of time by both parties to quickly determine if the candidate is indeed a good fit for the position.<p>Spec work, as in completing a project to receive consulting work, is an entirely different debate.",1344217376

I know several people who have done this in the past (myself included) though none quite as notorious as Woz.<p>I've made tear-off pads of $1 bills before, if you get a strap of new bills from the bank they come in sequential order and the pads will turn some heads but the bills are completely legit.<p>Uncut currency sheets don't have sequential serial numbers because of the way the print runs work; for uncut sheets the serial numbers are usually spaced by 20,000 or 32,000.<p>As a general habit I spend $2 bills a lot personally (they make excellent tips because people are so tickled to see them... They're not overly rare, go to the bank and ask and most times you can get them).<p>I've been to a couple of trade shows in the past where your ""pay"" for sitting through a particularly boring sales presentation was an uncut sheet of bills and a large pair or scissors and the tiny thrill of cutting off your own $1 bill.<p>Trivia for you all: uncut sheets have special serial number ranges, so you can identify that they came from uncut sheets (for modern bills the serial numbers are 96000000 and higher). This prevents people from buying an uncut sheet, cutting the bills in a strange manner, and then selling them at a premium as rare misprinted bills (not that it stops anyone, look on eBay for misprinted currency and see how many of the bills have high serial numbers...

Intellectual Ventures is a huge known patent troll.
I think bgC3, the new company of Bill Gates, is going to spearhead some very advanced patent trolling tactics (I have no evidence for this).<p>But right now the blogosphere is more or less just passively angry.

I support what they do, but the factual tone limits them to being short-term and prevents them from  making the vaguer strong claims that they should be making.<p>Groklaw is in the position to influence people on the most important subject of the 21st century, and I think they are doing a poor job of it as well as making whatever motives/resources might exist transparent.",1344216379

If I brought software to our clients with the explanation: ""toughen up, read the manuals, we adhered to your spec!"" then we simply wouldn't get paid. Git or DVCS in general isn't this nature though and is turn-key like MS Office for example. If some part of Office was a usability nightmare most people would simply avoid it. Some may not purchase the software altogether if they were to say take a trial of 30 days and couldn't get passed File->Save As or some rote ""simple"" command.

There's a simple argument that seems to indicate that they should not exist.  If I remember correctly, this argument was commonly accepted by engineers at the time Shannon's paper came out.<p>The argument is: you have a communications channel that flips bits with some probability, say 1/4.  Suppose you want to transmit one bit.  The first bit might have an error, so you add a parity bit -- now P(error) is 1/16.  But that parity bit might have an error, so you add a second parity bit, and you're down to P(error) of 1/64.  So you are driving P(error) to zero, but at the expense of ever-increasing overhead.<p>If you keep on adding parity bits, it's not clear that you can ever make the error probability arbitrarily small, while still transmitting some information.<p>That is, in the simple approach above, P(error) -> 0, but Overhead -> Infinity.<p>It is ""intuitively obvious"" that's a fundamental problem, or at least it was, until Shannon's results showed that intuition was wrong, or at least needed correction.
