But my experience with Safari at the Apple Store was that the FPS when scrolling through pages is noticeably low. (Also choppy enough as to be frown-inducing were native apps I tested, like REAPER.) I know it seems like a strange thing to complain about (who cares what FPS a desktop app runs at?), but it's something you have to see and feel to judge the impact on your overall experience, IMO.<p>Lion inverted trackpad scrolling so that when you drag your two fingers down, the content follows them, like there is a physical connection between your hand and the page. On the Retina MBP, that illusion was mostly lost for me. I'm actually curious to know if owners of the Retina display get used to this chugginess, or if it's still kind of a big deal, even after awhile.<p>I know only a little bit about hardware composition in WebKitand webpages are definitely not assembled ""entirely"" on the GPU. I suspect that there are gains to be made there, just in terms of how much work is being offloaded. Even if desktop Safari were to do what my old iPhone 3GS would doseparate the thread handling scrolling from the thread doing the painting, so that you could actually scroll ahead of where the renderer had filled in content, and see a checkerboard patternmight be a better feeling alternative. Then again, this could already be happening. I haven't kept up with WebKit changes. Credit to Apple for pushing the boundaries. But I want my buttery smooth page renders, damnit.<p>/end entitled whining",1344927101

4379723,comment,4379389,4379570,3,0,tsahyt,,,"You're probably right about a couple of things here. First of all, Apple's products are notoriously expensive. I've once got myself a list of hardware in the Mac Pro and looked up the individual prices of the components. It added up to roughly half of what Apple charges you. For that sort of money you have a <i>huge</i> margin of what you can do to make things quicker.<p>Also, laptops are <i>not</i> performance computers. The idea of a ""high-end gamer laptop"" makes me shiver and every time somebody asks me which laptop to buy for high-end gaming I'll tell them ""a desktop"". The thing is though, that a proper laptop is good enough for doing a lot of work-related tasks and definitely good enough for consumer use.<p>People like their laptops because they can carry them around, use them wherever they want. And they <i>know</i> that the price for this mobility is worse performance. Most people don't care though. It's quick enough for most things they do, so there's no reason to care either.<p>Personally I like my laptop, it's got a near-fullsize keyboard, a whopping 18.4"" display and I don't care about a mouse at all, so the touchpad doesn't bother me. It's quick enough for everything I do, large enough to be comfortable to work on but still at a size that makes it somewhat portable.<p>Now obviously, if you've got performance computing to do, stay away from laptops. For everything else, they're just fine.",1344926762

4379716,story,,,8,7,BTCThrowAway,"Ask HN: Are Maps Really this Dangerous?",,"Background:\nI work at a fairly big tech company. My team is working on a feature that will display maps and overlay data on top by shading in countries based on some metric.  I have never worked on maps before, but I have seen this used in all sorts of websites.  So our website doesn't seem to be breaking any new ground whatsoever.<p>Problem:\nWe want to get feedback on this feature, but before we can let customers see it, we need to have a bunch of committees sign off that we aren't doing anything that will get us sued or use language/graphics that will offend people in a random part of the world.  According to one committee, if we release these maps that use detailed country borders, we could get sued for millions of dollars and people could potentially be thrown in jail.  They claim that this is a likely scenario because there are other regions in the world that define borders differently than the western world and we must present them maps based on how their governments portray the world.  This means we would have to do some IP tracking and generate a custom map based on how each region should see that map and there could be dozens of different versions of the country borders.<p>We are looking to get < 100 customers to try this out in the U.S. and Canada. We are not looking to do a world-wide launch.<p>My questions for HN:\n1) Is what this committee saying true?  Can we really be sued or people thrown in jail for having software showing a potentially incorrect country border in a beta version of a website?<p>2) Do any of you run into these types of committees that enforce policies before you ship betas?  If so, are they a good thing for your company? Or do they do more harm than good?",1344926575

Literally a day after receiving his first MB12/L5MTHF injection he started talking. In the year and a half since, along with other supplements (fish oils, B6, probiotics, TMG, Zinc, etc -- all over the counter), and cutting out soy/gluten/dairy/eggs etc he's basically a totally typical kid now - he has no therapies, goes to a normal school, is advanced in some areas.<p>For myself, I lived a long time with low-grade but chronic anxiety and depression and after all this went down finally had some testing done on myself and found out I am homozygous for the C677T mutation, which means my body can't make methyl-B12 or methyl-folate. (Homozygous is 60-70% reduced efficiency in the reaction). I started supplementing with the same (though I get my MB12/L5MTHF orally, not injected), and for the first time feel like a cloud has been lifted. It's been amazing.<p>Turns out my mom, her dad, and so on and so forth were all B-12 anemic. It took my son being severely impacted for ME to finally get tested to finally figure out for the whole family what the problem is.<p>The interesting part is when the methylation process is disrupted by this mutation one of things whose production suffers is glutathione. It's a very important antioxidant (<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/glutathione-the-mother-of_b_530494.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/glutathione-the-...</a>). Thinking about one of the major detoxifiers of the body being broken is interesting in light of the seemingly tenuous links between ""autism"" and vaccines etc.<p>In short my armchair speculation is that there's likely a large overlap between undiagnosed 677T/1298C mutation sufferers and ""autism"" and when you think about injecting those kids with things that contain known irritants causing even more inflammation that the body can't clean out, it's not hard to imagine why it seems like they ""cause"" autism. To me it's simply more like pulling the trigger on a gun that's already been loaded and pointed to your head.<p>Homozygous 677T mutation rate is somewhere between 1-15% in the US.",1344925038
