55306,comment,55276,55276,0,0,gwenhwyfaer,,,"Turns out that the problem isn't concurrency <i>per se</i>, but shared mutable memory that an attacking process can sneak in and rewrite before the kernel reads it - and any schoolchild knows that if someone can sneak in and scribble all over something, they will. As if all the other problems with mutable state weren't quite bad enough... :)<p>I wonder how the history of computer architecture would have been altered had someone discovered a memory technology where writing into empty cells was very easy, but altering them extremely difficult, back in 1953? Such a memory technology would have been perfectly utilised by functional programming techniques, but would have made traditional mutable state extremely expensive (not impossible, as monads demonstrate, but not primitive). What would be different today...?",1189961534

I'm not sure if mild B vitamin deficiency is common or if very high doses do the opposite, but I've noticed a bigger mental boost from some energy drinks than from a similar amount of caffeine without the vitamins.",1189961497

Or, if he had discussed it beforehand, the founders had decided it was still a deal they would like to proceed with.<p>Instead, he went ahead and torpedoed the deal without the founders consent.  It certainly makes for good television, but I'd be pissed if I were one of the founders.<p>",1189960908

I sort of think that facebook's impressiveness is in its ability to scale the features so nicely.  <p>I don't think there are any features on facebook that couldn't be made by your average ycombinator news reader (they might be slow as all hell, but I bet most of us could create working demos of most features).",1189960080

55289,comment,54909,54909,0,0,nextmoveone,,,"Thanks for all the feedback...I just wanted to see what people thought.<p>At work I'm attempting to scale a mix of procedural php(60%) and object oriented php(40%) for a temporary 'system'. While I build a new one from scratch; I have complete freedom as to what the new system is written in and I was feeling that Ruby on Rails would be a good starting point because of its 'rapid development'.<p>The 'busy' season for my company is less than 2 months away and there are alot things that need to be done:
-Restructure DB
-Handle Web Service Consumption(WSDL with SOAP binding) on multiple occasions
-Deploy our own web service for Sales through 'affiliates'
-Have be able to be extended in the future by programmers other than myself<p>I am kind of stuck because with PHP it's ridiculously easy to consume webservices via nusoap(os library/class), but then I lose the ORM, but I have the freedom of customizing my DB interaction.<p>Then if I choose the ORM(rails) I have to deal with a slightly complicated webservice communication procedure. Plus there is a high probability that I will have to customize the db interaction so much that it may defeat the purpose in the first place.<p>So I'm leaning towards writing my own PHP+MySQL code from scratch, but I'm all alone so writing it wouldn't be something that seems accomplish-able in 3 months. Ruby on rails seems fast enough, but that web service thing seems like a real PAIN. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place.<p>Anyway, Thanks for everyones feedback!

55288,comment,54834,55036,0,0,vlad,,,"I want to chime in because your two posts combined are still valued less than pg's rebuttal, but I think you are more right.  Early cars were simply modified carriages with motors attached by hobbyists.  Hobbyists--already busy enough building and improving their engines--wouldn't stop to learn how to carve wood.<p>Two interesting ideas come to me about this.<p>From what I've read, Henry Ford studied assembly lines at the Springfield Armory (which was first to create machines to make individual parts for guns, as well as first to allow non-skilled labor to assemble pieces together without involving a craftsman at all.)  What's ironic is that two brothers who created and sold the first gasoline car (motorized carriage) were also in Springfield.<p>Henry Ford made many innovations to the product and the pipeline.  New competitors innovated on the design front to get more customers, while Henry didn't.  Since Henry did not change his automobile, and people wanted to buy cars in the 1920's with a more modern look (as defined by not looking like the same car Ford had put out since 1908), other designs took hold.<p>Successive design changes are made to stand out from the current crowd, that's all.<p>
