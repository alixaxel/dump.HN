Then I installed a CVS package that included the programs it needed, including RCS programs.  Its version didn't work with emacs.  If there were a package manager I would have been warned about the conflict.<p>I've been using Debian for years, and Ubuntu recently, but I had to look up autoremove; I've never used that apt-get feature.  I have used autoclean, which is benign.  It does sound like there are problems with autoremove that should be fixed, but for now why not just avoid that feature?",1189796232

54680,comment,54630,54630,0,0,Jd,,,"This is another semi-misleading title.  The article points out that Ubuntu on Dell, as with all versions of Linux, is still not ready for the mass market.  However, as the readers of this site are not ""average"" computer users the ""too rough"" comment does not really apply to us.  Yes, I have to hack a bit to get my multiple monitor setup to work.  Yes, I expect to.  <p>Although I have a recently purchased Dell Ubuntu and am quite pleased with it I would never recommend it to say... my mom.  <p>",1189795800

However, one way in which entrepreneurs frequently get off track is by trying to squeeze as much information as they can into the conversation with the hope that some of the details will hook the VC.

It has some real cruft around the edges, and I can see Haskell or Scala picking up real momentum before OCaml ever does.<p>Erlang: learn it. It is a simple language and as a programmer you'll probably find it very interesting. Also if you haven't done much functional programming, Erlang will push you into it. Erlang obviously has an advantage when it comes to parallel processing, but we'll have to see whether the string support ever gets better, whether it gets more mainstream libraries, and whether the complete lack of objects is an issue for adoption.<p>Right now I think Erlang is being hyped a little prematurely, but that might change if other languages can't adapt adequately to multi-core programming.",1189795536

So the Yahoo offer is much more lucrative.<p>Is it a justifiable to work on this idealogy for an acquisition? Say, for xyz.com, if each user brings in $10 on average (through advertising or sales), should the acquisition value (per user value) be more than that amount?<p>I'm not quite aware of this, so thought I'd ask.",1189795498

54673,comment,54630,54657,0,0,AF,,,"You know I really do like apt, but it isn't perfect, and 'rough around the edges' isn't a bad description for it (I know he meant Ubuntu as a whole).<p>I've had multiple times that by using apt-get autoremove, my entire Ubuntu installation has been fubared. It is almost nicer how Windows and Mac apps ship with all the required libraries and functionality they need, and you don't have to worry about it (both as a developer and a user). Add to that the confusion where programming languages have their own package managers (should I use Python's easy_install or the .debs?) and there's even more of a mess.<p>I've never had any difficulties on my Mac or on Windows due to a lack of a package manager, but I have had problems using apt.<p>I don't understand, what advantages does using a package manager have over simply shipping an app with the libraries/programs it needs? Yeah, you save hard drive space, but with hundreds of gigabytes of data, is that even important?",1189794913
54672,comment,54650,54650,0,0,danteembermage,,,"Worth pointing out is that, while the studies are almost certainly wrong, they develop into less wrong that builds on the old more wrong.<p>Take the Bohr atom, horribly wrong, but immensely valuable in  it's time (and still pedagogically). Then you add sub-orbitals, orbital hybridization theory, and the quantum mechanical model, all almost certainly wrong.<p>Even in the social sciences you have results like ""if we make charitable gifts tax deductible, revenue will go down, but gifts will go up more than the lost revenue"" later studies came along using people as their own control by studying their behavior through time instead of just over one year, and the opposite is true, tax revenue goes down more than giving goes up. So the original study was ""wrong""  but to get the right answer you have to start with the simple and build up.<p>There are certainly areas that are so entangled with inter-relations and data difficulties that make empirical studies worthless until someone comes up with decent models to untangle it all, but I think those are the exception rather than the rule.",1189794616

54669,comment,54650,54650,0,0,robg,,,"In my field, I've watched as the statistics have been invented to deal with the data. Papers from the early neuroimaging days may not have the best, or even correct, stats, but we know if those studies were on to something if the findings were replicated. I think that iteration in science is as good an approximation of 'truth' as we can get from the world around us. Without replication any individual finding is suspect, no matter how much play it gets in the popular press.

Repeat all of them. You should then get some idea of which 50 of the 1000 studies saw noise and treated it as data. <i>Then</i> compare the media attention accorded to the 50 versus the 950 -- that should tell you what you probably already know: that since we're drawn to interesting results, and implausible truths are interesting, we all pay disproportionate attention to studies that happen to be wrong.",1189793371
