About a year after that I finally landed a job as a web developer, and I've been able to do that ever since. I've never really been without a ""real"" job.<p>One of my friends, however, once answered, ""when the trust fund runs out.""",1189717113
54403,comment,54324,54370,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Two thumbs up for the Dilbert financial plan. May it spread far and wide.<p>If you're the kind of person who can't bring himself to follow a simple and sensible plan like Dilbert's, I have the book for you: William Bernstein's ""The Four Pillars of Investing"".<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfolio/dp/0071385290/ref=sr_1_2/103-3892353-0078258?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189716378&sr=1-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Four-Pillars-Investing-Building-Portfo...</a><p>If you follow Bernstein's advice you will end up with Dilbert's financial plan, except that instead of one giant index fund you'll have a bunch of smaller index funds - some small-cap, some large-cap growth, some international, and so on. Plus bonds, of course. In other words, you'll be a Vanguard customer. But there's nothing wrong with that.<p>This additional layer of complexity might be good for an additional point or two of growth. Or it might turn out to be a useless exercise in micromanagement. But it's a nice safe way to satisfy your urge to pretend that doing a lot of higher math and complicated bookkeeping is making you richer. The book is careful to steer you away from stupid stock-picking strategies, stupid stock newsletters, and advisers who work on commission (who are, by definition, not on your side).",1189717074

I'm stepping outside my area of expertise, but here's my intuition:<p>Radiative cooling and thermal isolation seem to be fairly well understood. They can also (unlike many, many other parts of the problem) be tested on Earth. Basically, any satellite needs to deal with this stuff, and designers <i>have</i> been dealing with it for a long while.<p>Now, if you add lunar dust to the mix, sure, that's a complicating factor, but I don't see it being as bad as some of the other things I mentioned.",1189715951
54394,comment,54324,54385,0,0,Goladus,,,"At the first company I worked at after graduating, many of the supervisor and manager cubicles had little certificates on them saying that they completed some sort of ""Who Moved My Cheese"" seminar.  I remember seeing copies of ""7 Habits of Highly Effective People"" as well.  Right before I left I saw someone with a copy of a book like ""Love 'em or Lose 'em"" a book about how to keep good employees.  It's cover looked suspicious to me but I don't know much about it.<p>Honestly, though, most managers simply did not read, and those who did certainly didn't read anything about how to become a better manager, unless it was forced on them from corporate.  Even those who took the initiative to read the bad books on that list will probably benefit.",1189715830

54386,comment,54236,54309,0,0,euccastro,,,"I think you got this impression from William Clinger's proposal.  He seems the most diplomatic from the gang, and still he isn't talking about migrating to R6RS, but cherry picking redeemable features from R6RS to enrich a design mostly based on R[45]RS.  Most explicitly ((de)emphasis mine):<p><i>The development of Extended R5RS Scheme might even provide a practical migration path from the R5RS to </i>some future standard that supersedes both<i> the R5RS and the R6RS while unifying the Scheme community to a degree that might be</i> hard to imagine at this moment.<p><a href=""http://scheme-punks.cyber-rush.org/wiki/index.php?title=ERR5RS:Charter&redirect=no"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scheme-punks.cyber-rush.org/wiki/index.php?title=ERR5...</a><p>Note, anyway, that Clinger's manifesto, while probably being an inspiration for the initiative, is not <i>that</i> prominent in the front page.  See the opening paragraphs there:<p><i>On 29 August 2007, the Revised Revised Revised Revised Revised Revised Report on Scheme was ratified by the Steering Committee. This has made a lot of people quite angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.<p>Many programmers believe that it was created by some sort of community process, though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the entire Standard was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being called the Great Green Arkleseizure. This theory is not widely accepted outside Viltvodle VI, and so, standards being the puzzling documents that they are, other standards are being designed.</i><p><a href=""http://scheme-punks.cyber-rush.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scheme-punks.cyber-rush.org/wiki/index.php?title=Main...</a><p>And some more aggressive statements of purpose:<p><i>To support the development of new standards for Scheme that fork from R4RS and R5RS in parallel to the R6RS.</i><p>[...]<p><i>To agree upon a new name to clearly distinguish it from The Language Formerly Known As Scheme (AKA R6RtlfkaS AKA R6RS).</i><p><a href=""http://scheme-punks.cyber-rush.org/wiki/index.php?title=Charter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scheme-punks.cyber-rush.org/wiki/index.php?title=Char...</a><p>So..",1189714147

I'd also call them over-hyped, rather than over-rated (who honestly would rate 'Chicken Soup for the Soul at Work' as a serious business book)?<p>I'd have been far more interested in seeing books selected from the 'recommended reading' list used for (say) Harvard Business School, and then an examination of the merits of those.   It could also be very interesting to compare the reading lists of the top b-schools to get a glimpse at their emphasis and biases.<p>Like most 'top 10' lists, I suspect this was intended more as a space-filler than as a serious contribution.<p>This just made #1 on my '10 Overrated Articles'.

The cinema still has to allocate a normal sized screen to it (150-400 seats) which it could be filling with this weeks new releases instead. This may work however in combination with smaller capacity screens instead (20-50). The exception is when sequels are released.
