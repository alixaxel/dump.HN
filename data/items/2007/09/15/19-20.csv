Just think about how much exactly $200K would last them and how much more money they'd need to raise to become profitable. Not to mention the control problems.<p>As funny as that whole thing was, the prof was right to break that deal. This company wouldn't have gone anywhere anyway with that kind of a structure.",1189885933

54974,comment,54834,54892,0,0,paul,,,"Yes, clearly we sometimes need to push what is ""normal"" and create things that people don't yet know they want, but we should be pragmatic about it. For example, Esperanto may be a more ""rational"" and well designed language, but I'm going to keep using English because that's what works for me. The early cars were ""horseless carriages"" because that was easier to build and easier for people to relate to, and there's nothing wrong with that.<p>The notion that ""I know exactly what people need and my ideas are all rational and brilliant while other's are stupid and irrational"" is just so arrogant and wrong, but it seemed to be the main point of the Fountainhead (based on the 1/3 of the book that I read 10 years ago...)",1189883208
