The great scientists often make this error. They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big thing right off.""",1189306313

Paul Buchheit does not expect any articles to be about him, so when he sees "" Paul "" in an article, he does not feel an instinctive reaction of curiosity followed by quick repulsion.<p>I'm kidding, of course, but it could definitely be a learned reaction of seeing many Paul articles to be about oneself.",1189305590

Otherwise you'd think they'd have the sense to either start downvoting, or simply stop using reddit, rendering it a site with 100 readers who all vote. More likely many of the 100,000 see reddit as their best source for all the Ron Paul news the 'mainstream' media is 'trying to hide' from them.\n",1189305558

If you want to access data but don't know how its going to be accessed until run time (i.e., if you need to search records based on any number of parameters), a relational database makes sense.<p>Also, the people he should be scared of are VAX people, not RDB people.

52383,comment,52251,52270,0,0,dood,,,"I think zealous voting is indeed representative of the current userbase: <p>For a long time the quality and diversity of links in Reddit was quite stable, reflecting the strong core userbase. Major systemic issues [1] led to more junk-food like submissions edging in, and slowly the forces involved drove out the original core audience, long-september style. This process continued gaining momentum, until fairly quickly lurching to the new stable state we find it in today. A similar process can be observed in wikipedia: those who care the most, have the most time, and the most tolerance for internet drama naturally dominate: the young and the passionate.<p>1. a) Reddit conflated two distinct actions into a single vote: training the recommendation engine (vote on what you like/dislike) and judging quality (what is good/bad). This lead to a culture of voting on <i>taste</i>, tending the system away from voting on <i>quality</i>, partly because of:\nb) The nature of these systems, like the mainstream media, is to tend to the lowest common denominator as audience size increases. This should not have been surprising.<p>How to avoid these issues? Paul's suggestion (somewhere else on this page) about automated topic clustering is a good one. A similar approach I favor is encouraging clusters of users to form naturally, using a collaborative classification/filtering approach; even something as simple as allowing three tags per link could do this. Once clusters are established, it should be much easier to allow users to opt-in or out of the clusters they like/dislike. The editor/oracle approach and/or weighted voting should also work, but seems like a lot more effort.<p>[ahem. I feel like I should mention I'm somewhat biased, as I'm now working on something experimental in this domain]",1189304295

52379,comment,52251,52335,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"No, I think the real problem is that talking about politics brings out the worst in people who disagree with you (because you make them feel angry), and the only the mildly unsavory in people who don't (because you make them feel smug).  How many people responded to <i>What You Can't Say</i> with some form of ""Yes for thee, but not for me""?<p>Telling people an important part of their opinion-forming mechanism -- their facts, or their fact-finding, or their ability to tell ""probative"" from ""normative"" -- is just as special case that gives everyone an equal opportunity to show his ass.<p>I actually spent some time thinking about how you could do better than what's out there now -- provide a way to enforce good rhetorical behavior; set some rules about evidence; and especially, make prominence based on credibility or evidentiary support.<p>But in the end, I don't think many forum users would really prefer the hard work of keeping their opinions in line with all the available facts to the satisfaction of beating a disembodied un-person in a non-argument.
