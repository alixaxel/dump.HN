(or maybe I just don't know where to look)<p>i.e. let's say you've developed a little site.  it launched with a little buzz but then tapered off.  you've added a bunch of features and a lot of the site/code infrastructure is in place to take it to the next level, but you've done very little marketing / etc.<p>What to do next in this case?  I have a site like that which is kind of rotting on the vine... a few k in revenue each month gradually sloping downward without anymore work on it from my part.<p>Biggest problem: managing people part-time can be a huge pain.",1189302925

While PG is likely genuinely dissatisfied with the current algorithms of reddit and digg, in this post, he was simply expressing helplessness about the many Ron Paul stories he has had to see on one of his favorite sites, and feels like he is responsible enough for the creation of the site to try to do something about it, but not really being able to do so.<p>For instance, Paul's argument did not take into account that voting up Ron Paul related articles is more about certain principles than about the man himself.<p>Some people like that Paul is pro-drugs.  Some people like that he has the most consistent voting record.  Some people like that he is libertarian.  Some people like that he's fiscally responsible.  That is not a single issue, unlike what PG has said in another post.<p>But beyond voting up unexpected political principles, readers also like to vote for articles that mention that media outlets reset or deleted polls and misrepresented their results, as well as those which criticize internet users for heavily favoring Ron Paul the most--which redditors and diggers feel is an attack on them or their intelligence.<p>Another reason users vote up Ron Paul stories is because users like rooting for the little guy.<p>Another reason is that users feel there is an injustice being done, such as that the main-stream media is not giving enough face time to all candidates.<p>Another reason has political roots--some users feel the other candidates aren't good enough, and regardless of what they think about Ron Paul, he has a consistent voting record.<p>Finally, many users vote up Ron Paul to vote for policy change, and realize there is little chance Ron Paul will actually be elected.<p>It has also become a self-serving prophecy in the main stream media that internet users heavily prefer Ron Paul and are responsible for online and text messaging votes, so those who use the internet think that's who they should vote for.<p>There are many, many reasons why Ron Paul is being selected.  When articles with his name come up, there are a variety of reasons to vote them up.  Those may not be good reasons to vote up those articles, but they're genuine, and I doubt there's a conspiracy.",1189302581

(and the JohnChow.com crowd)<p>I do find it hilarious though that many of these internet marketing nerds make hundreds of thousands a month while many Web 2.0 companies spend millions and can barely bring in a few thousand in revenues.\n",1189302366
52375,comment,52351,52351,0,0,curi,,,"<i>In response to the study, the Food Standards Agency advised parents to monitor their children's activity and, if they noted a marked change with food containing additives, to adjust their diets accordingly, eliminating artificial colors and preservatives.</i><p>That's stupid too. Parents aren't going to monitor children's behavior <i>scientifically</i>. They aren't going to record it carefully and objectively and compare it to control data previously recorded. This advice will simply lead them to act on whims and fancies.",1189302350

Numerous support groups for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have for years recommended removing such ingredients from diets, although experts have continued to debate the evidence.</i><p>So, the parents and support groups ""knew"" the answer <i>before</i> there was scientific evidence supporting their claims.<p>So, they didn't know, they just have an unscientific agenda.<p>Now the article acts like their position was validated. It was not. It's scientific status hasn't changed whether science happens to reach the same conclusion or not. They are irrational either way.",1189302094

52369,comment,52251,52254,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"The idea of a popular and high quality ""social news"" site is fundamentally broken.  Either you want a mass market or you want quality content.  The mass market has an IQ of 100 and will not choose content that generally appeals to people here puzzling over ""social news"".  Any fix that gets rid of the stuff morons like will cost you the mass market.<p>The metafilter people already went through all this.  They started to achieve mass market popularity and quality started to go to shit.  They cut off new membership and let attrition get rid of some people.  Then they were happy again with their small community.<p>If you introduce an editorial role, well guess what, it's not ""social news"" anymore.  Slashdot and Fark are far from new and web2.0.<p>This problem is nothing new.  Look at reddit's sister company, Wired.  Wired went from great in the 90s to mostly moronic and consumerist now.  It's also a lot more popular now.",1189301783
