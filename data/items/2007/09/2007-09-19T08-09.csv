Then you have to think about pods getting in each others way, and you can try and set up chains of the enemy's pods to be clever.<p>Also, the computer is too quick and accurate at placing pods. Make him a bit slower and stupider...",1190192307
56791,comment,55381,55679,0,0,myelin,,,"I think there is, although all I've been doing is limiting how many CPUs a VM is allowed to use.  Every VM starts out with vcpus=1, and we add more when the load factor gets up too high.<p>This is quite effective on a server with 8 cores (two quad Xeons) and 4G of RAM, as by the time you've given each VM 512M of RAM, there's plenty of cores to go around.  It would be more problematic on a single or dual core machine, though.<p>There are still a couple of ways a single VM can kill the box, though: it can max out the disks (so you really don't want to be running out of memory, unless you have a dedicated swap drive, so swap doesn't compete with normal disk access) and it can max out the network bandwidth.<p>In a hosting environment you'd probably want to set up some sort of internal traffic shaping so the each VM has a fair go at the available bandwidth, and you'd also want to keep swap partitions on a separate disk to data.  This way if a couple of VMs run out of memory, they compete for the swap disk but other VMs that are within their limits and don't touch the swap disk don't see a problem.<p>I don't know, but I imagine you might be able to do some magic with LVM to balance disk transactions/throughput between logical volumes...",1190191942

Brightroll has a similar rule and rejected my application. MochiAds seems to be exclusively for games.<p>All these damn companies suck and Google isn't in this game which sucks.<p>
Thanks again.",1190191265

Yes, a 2G phone is definitely a step back for most European and Asian mobile phone users.<p>But they do have a cool solution using the Cloud WiFi service.  O2 iPhones automatically hop between WiFi routers on the Cloud network as you move between nodes (seamless to the user).",1190191106

For audio recording and music--I've never taken a single computer class after high school AP classes.  My co-founder went to a good school in Australia, but I didn't know what it was when filling out the application so I just said, ""some school in Australia, probably a good one, and probably for computer science"".<p>That said, the number of Stanford, CMU, UC, MIT, etc. students and graduates is quite high in YC, and I can't think of any other community college bums in the bunch.",1190190051
