58068,comment,58025,58025,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Sometimes we find ourselves working with schemas that clearly have elements of truth, but that for some reason don't seem to hold up well empirically. Often times this is because the schema we have in our heads is more broadly defined than the underlying phenomenon.<p>A good example of this is the phenomenon of prodigies. We know there are some people in society who are exceptionally talented in certain areas, and we call these people prodigies. We then have certain schemas that we apply to these prodigies in our quest for wisdom.<p>But even though prodigies clearly exist, our schemas often seem to not hold up so well. For example, studies have shown that child prodigies are often not significantly more successful than the rest of us when they grow up. And similarly, many prodigious adults were completely unremarkable as children. Why is this? How is it possible for such exceptional children not to make anything of themselves, and for such exceptional adults to have been completely average as children?<p>Malcolm Gladwell observes that the reason for this is because when we describe child prodigies, we are describing people who are gifted at learning. Whereas when we describe adult prodigies, we are actually describing people are gifted at doing.<p>Because we are applying one set of sensemaking tools to both groups, our schemas tend to not hold up so well even though they are based on an underlying truth. The solution to this is to create one set of schemas for understanding and dealing with child prodigies, and another set of schemas for understanding and dealing with adult prodigies. <p>There are often areas where we engage in fuzzy thinking, and apply one toolset to multiple distinct phenomena. Philosophers and thinkers can create enormous value by identifying distinct phenomena, and giving suggestions for how to think about each one.<p>PG actually does this in his essay How to Make Wealth. He observes that money and wealth are not the same thing so we should think about them differently. Specifically, that money is sort of an abstraction of wealth, but for various reasons we can benefit from thinking about wealth on a lower level. Providing the sort of disambiguation that this essay does is really valuable, which is why this is arguably the most useful of all the PG essays. <p>It seems like with math we start with something we know is true but not necessarily useful (like just the concept of a line) and then we abstract our way to usefulness. This is opposed to philosophy, which generally takes the stance that all models are false but some models are useful. In philosophy we usually start with something that is useful in certain situations but not necessarily universally true, and then we disambiguate our way down toward truthfulness. I don't really see a problem with philosophy as long as it is empirically useful under at least in certain conditions. <p>I feel there are two major issues with philosophy today:<p>1. No ""philosophical method"" the same way there is a scientific method, which means philosophy doesn't really build on each other from one philosopher to the next.<p>2. No real way to categorize ideas the same way you can categorize physics research, which makes it hard to find prior art. So even though Malcolm Gladwell and PG make really good arguments, there is no guarantee that people in the future will use these arguments. As opposed to science where is something is proven true it becomes the basis for future works.",1190404296

58064,comment,58025,58025,0,0,ingenium,,,"I'm currently a philosophy of science and molecular biology double major, and I have to say I agree with Paul Graham's criticisms of traditional philosophy. None of it really makes sense, and is generally nothing more than someone's opinion. Yet we hold philosophers such as Aristotle in high regard. <p>Philosophy of science is different from classical philosophy in that it focuses on more concrete aspects. One of the best classes I took was the philosophy of artificial intelligence. We discussed what it is to be conscious, and how we differed from a computer, it at all. <p>Other classes focused on the history of evolution or relativity and studied how these theories were formed and the arguments from the scientific community against them. While a lot of the readings are books or essays by people simply giving their opinions, I've learned to consider what they have to say, but that it is OK and in fact encouraged to disagree and give your own opinion. Since philosophy cannot be ""proven"" like a mathematical proof, another's opinions are not any more correct than my own as long as both are formed logically. <p>What I took from philosophy was not the opinions of the ""great philosophers"", but rather was the ability to think about things logically and confidently make my own opinions on them.",1190403863

Where else can you deal with everything that western philosophy offers, from classification to epistemology to the philosophy of language and science -- and at the end of the day produce something that has immediate value for someone? All of this working, real-world stuff we're doing, from heuristics to machine learning and meta-programming -- it's all applied philosophy.",1190403675

My college had a great books curriculum, and the few books from the last 100 years changed my thinking as much as all the earlier ones combined.  Rawls' veil of ignorance is especially elegant.<p>One note about modern philosophy, though.  One of my cofounders enjoys reading about neuroscience, and I was talking to him about modern philosophy a few months ago.  He suggested, quite wisely, that in a few hundred years, the early 21st century work that philosophers read is as likely to come from science-oriented guys like Steven Pinker and Daniel Dennett (i.e. the meaningoflife.tv cohort) as it is from traditional philosophers.",1190403625

58045,comment,57915,57915,0,0,Zak,,,"This will actually make cars handle worse unless it's redesigned in one of two non-trivial ways. The problem is camber: the side-to-side tilt of the wheel and tire. Bringing the top of the wheel closer to the center of the car is called ""negative camber"" while the opposite is ""positive camber"". Most modern cars have a little bit of negative camber, which increases as the suspension is compressed. The relationship of compression to camber is called the ""camber curve"".<p>When the tire is being deformed by cornering forces, negative camber helps more of the tire stay in contact with the road. When traveling in a straight line, negative camber reduces the tire's contact with the road and increases tire wear. The reduced contact is visible on the left rear tire in the fourth photo.<p>One solution is to design a suspension with a very fast camber curve and allow minimal compression when cornering. This is similar to what most sports cars already do, and has a couple problems of its own. Such a suspension design is more limited in the distance the wheel can travel upward  and has somewhat less traction on bumpy surfaces.<p>Another solution is to have a separate motor to adjust camber. That's expensive and heavy, but would probably work pretty well.",1190401766
