But I agree with gnaritas that turning over the keys to your on-line identity was too big a step for me. Which argues, I guess for a distributed model that could share results.",1197865829

That's precisely the strength of OpenID (and <i>not</i> \nMS Passport). You're free to use any OpenID provider which <i>you trust</i> (including <i>yourself</i>), but you aren't <i>required</i> to use anyone in particular, like this guy suggests Google could/should do.<p>For example, I recently set up my personal website URL to be my OpenID (very easy: two additional <link> tags), which currently delegates to an account I registered with the myopenid.com provider, but I could easily change it at any time to another provider if I found another better provider that I trusted more (or even myself using something like <a href=""http://siege.org/projects/phpMyID/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://siege.org/projects/phpMyID/</a>)<p>Now, if Google wanted to be an OpenID provider (like AOL, LiveJournal, Technorati, WordPress, and others have done) I would be all for that. What we <i>don't</i> need is some proprietary system.<p>I suggest anyone developing a web app look into supporting OpenID authentication. It's not too much additional work, and it would make the web a better place if it were widely deployed. Plaxo has detailed instructions on converting existing web apps to support OpenID: <a href=""http://www.plaxo.com/api/openid_recipe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plaxo.com/api/openid_recipe</a><p>And for the rest of you, you should set up an OpenID and start using it wherever possible. Sam Ruby has good instructions on using your URL as an OpenID <a href=""http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-SuperUsers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2007/01/03/OpenID-for-non-S...</a> or OpenID.net has information on getting an OpenID from any number of providers: <a href=""http://openid.net/get/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openid.net/get/</a>",1197865135

90230,comment,90156,90156,0,0,mhartl,,,"Python was the first language I ever loved.  And I've defended it, and especially its whitespace for block structure, more times than I can count.  (One Perl programmer I know can't mention Python without describing it as ""that whitespace language"", and I couldn't understand why until I saw some of his, ahem, ""creatively indented"" Perl code.  I'm so anal about indentation that I really never noticed.)<p>But eventually I realized that whitespace is an Achilles heel in one context: using Python as an HTML-embedded template language---unfortunately, a very important case.  Seeing this Django book, and finally understanding how they solved the template-language problem with Python, appears to confirm this intuition.  They solve it the same way all Python frameworks solve it: they introduce a separate, template-specific language.<p>This is one big reason why I love Ruby, and Rails.  Because Ruby uses an ""end"" keyword, it works great as an HTML-embedded language.  This means that, in Rails, you <i>always</i> have a full-strength language at your disposal, and never have to use a watered-down template language. <p>It's possible that Django is awesome nonetheless---it does seem to be attracting some first-rate hackers---and I could certainly be convinced to switch, but being able to use embedded Ruby will keep me firmly in the Rails camp for the time being.",1197864248
