It just falls over, paralyzed. It literally hangs forever</i><p>He probably just needs to disable automatic builds. There are other automatic features that can be disabled as well. Eclipse can be stripped down like anything else.<p><i>nothing that would permit the removal of the copy-and-paste duplication patterns that Java programmers think of as ""inevitable boilerplate"", but which are in fact easily factored out in dynamic languages.</i><p>You know, I've never heard the phrase ""inevitable boilerplate"" from a Java programmer, though his quotation marks suggest that he has. There are some things that can really be shrunk down in non-Java languages, but a lot of the examples that people point out are harmless:<p><pre><code>  System.out.println(""output here"");
</code></pre>
or<p><pre><code>  for (Object obj : list)
  {

  }

These sorts of things don't really add to complexity.  Too bad he didn't provide any specific examples of his own. Typically, when attacking Java (the most common sport in the software world today) people will pretend it has disabilities it doesn't have.<p><i>like non-broken closures, that the Java community is resisting tooth and nail</i><p>Another phenomenon I haven't seen too much of, I guess. Most resistence probably comes from people who know what will happen, rather than people who dislike the feature in and of itself...<p>I'll say this about Java, since I get the impression that a lot of ynews people are in college or just out of college: I've had gigantic mountains of Java code thrown at me that I could make useful modifications to in minutes. It is hard to obfuscate. By contrast, I have dealt with Javascript codebases that were a nightmare to work with simply because the previous guy thought it useful to graft functions onto objects (or is it ""prototypes"") at runtime.

We're currently using Yahoo! Small Business to do this, which is very good. However, it turns out that you can only host a finite number of domains per user ID - They say it's for security purposes, but I'm not sure I believe that line... <p>Anyways, as a result we're looking for a host that provides an EASY reseller interface. Us technical folks don't usually get involved with the domain purchasing & provisioning since Yahoo does that part so well, and I'd like to keep it that way. I'm familiar with standard hosts like Rackspace & Mosso, but they don't appear to be terribly user friendly. <p>What I would like our business people to be able to do is: 
1. Log in to the reseller management page.
2. Buy a domain name.
3. Have that domain name automatically provisioned and set up an FTP site with user and password so that we can pass those credentials off to our designer. <p>We never charge our customers for these domains, so that is not important. <p>These are all purely brochure-ware sites, with 1 php form that emails form results to our client.

91254,comment,90876,91051,0,0,iamwil,,,"I woke up at 4am this morning for no reason and decided to go through it.  I thought it was pretty clear.  As an aside, from purely a learning experience, it was kinda fun and eye opening.  At least I can see why geeks think it's neat.<p>Anyway, the namespace clash is reduced with a ycombinator because you'd only have to declare it once.  Here, it seems like there's not much of a gain because we only used it on hash.  But if you wanted to use the same trick on array, or other containers, you'd essentially be not only duplicating code, but also taking up namespace with a make_array, or make_othercontainer.  In addition, any time you wanted recursion, you'd be able to use it.  <p>If I had to take a stab at it, ycombo is a way to implement recursion mechanism when the language doesn't provide named recursion, loops, or iterators, and all you get are first-class functions and a few substitution rules.  <p>As for (a), It seems pretty inane to use ycombo given that modern high level languages provide named recursions, loops, and iterators.  But what if you don't get those things?  Generally, you'd have to make your own recursion mechanism.  <p>When would you ever have languages that don't have those things?  Probably not often.  But Forth comes to mind.  I've never used Forth, but from what little I know about it, the language starts off with some basic primitives and that's it.  No loops, no if statements.  How do you get anything done?  Well, you build your own control structures.  People use Forth because it's possible to build your own very small compiler from the ground up written in Forth itself, and still understand the entire thing.  I suspect it's used in embedded programming because of that reason.<p>By that notion, I'm guessing you can physically build a lisp interpreter machine based on very few principles, like functions and substitution.  Everything else can be derived in software, even things we think as basic, such as numbers and counting.  Because of that, we can just build the basic axioms in hardware, and everything else can be built in software on top.  That lowers the cost of your hardware if you can build it in fewer parts.  ycombinator, in this case, would be a way to build recursion on a piece of hardware that only supports functions and substitution rules.  With recursion, you can process lists of things, which means you can get stacks, and data structures, and rest of the wonderful world you're use to.<p>In any case, I figured PG and co. called it ycombinator because they hope that people they fund will in turn pay it forward and start other early stage funding companies.  They're the first of many recursive calls to make_startup().",1198095497

Scala adds novel  ideas not found in other JVM languages, and makes certain types of problems much easier than they would otherwise be.
