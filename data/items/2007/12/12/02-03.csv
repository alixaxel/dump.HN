88536,comment,88296,88523,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"The deficit is certainly a problem, and it is not sustainable.  However, interest rates don't really have much of an effect on the deficit.  Sure, the government has to borrow money at a rate determined by the market -- why would anyone invest in a government bond paying, say, 2% when you could get a AAA corporate paying a much higher rate?  But Congress has unfortunately shown a willingness to borrow money regardless of the interest costs.  Keep in mind that short-term government interest rates were in double digits for most of the Reagan 80s, when the deficit was massively expanding.",1197428372

Remember, there's a good chance your first launch will fail.  We launched 2 sites in the 9 months where I kept my day job, and both went kerplop.  That could be because of a half-hearted effort (the app I'm working on was also the main plan, I just couldn't concentrate enough to build it while I still had the day job), but in general easy sites don't make money, and sites that make money aren't easy.",1197427817

The economy seems to be heading to a recession, but how will this affect the internet startup world? ...""</i><p>I remember reading somewhere on the Internet that one way to solve problems was to <i>""redefine""</i> them. [0] So try thinking <i>""reasons you should start a startup""</i>.  I can think of a few straight off. <p>- the coder pool is going to increase as businesses close or lay off extra staff. <p>- rents on property are going to be cheaper<p>- consumers are probably going to tighten the strings and shun payment to services of dubious value<p>- as opportunities, credit dries up, creators are really going to have to re-evaluate ""what users want"", now. Not pre-crash or recession. <p>- now you have to be frugal out of necessity :)<p>The advantage here is the rules of the game change. And change quickly. Where there is change there is opportunity as yesterdays <i>""new ideas""</i> become mainstream and relegated to the history of technology.  Thats one theory. The other is in the hiatus the chance to build new technology and ideas has some breathing room to grow.<p>I'd also like you to consider the <i>""future effect""</i> of the current boom. A backlash is coming for those working in <i>""safe, secure jobs""</i> where market demand wane.  I found this in the Australian press [1] and read as follows:<p><i>""... Michael Warrilow, Managing director of IT advisory company Hydrasight, believes today's tight labour market may be creating resentment among employers who have made pool-playing, T-Shirt wearing and all-day-Facebooking a part of the work 2.0 experience ...""

Once employers have more choice, there will be a backlash against their behaviour.

88512,comment,88296,88477,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"There are certainly risks to cutting rates: it hurts our currency and increases inflation risk.  I don't think your analysis is correct, though.  First of all, the Fed hasn't been continuously cutting rates: the first cut was in September, after several years of continuous increases.  Since then, they've only cut the Fed Funds target rate (the rate at which banks can lend to each other overnight) from 5.25% in summer 2006 to 4.25% now... a drop of only 1%.<p>Interest rates are nowhere near where they were at the beginning of the housing expansion -- the Fed Funds target rate was at 1% in 2003; it's at 4.25% now.  Most people are saying that even in a recession scenario, the Fed will only cut to around 3%.  Fed Funds aside, other interest rates remain high.  LIBOR (the primary rate at which banks lend to each other) is around 1% above Fed Funds, depending on the maturity.  Interest rates on corporate bonds are creeping up as lenders demand to be compensated for increased default risks.  Swap spreads have widened.  Consumer rates on mortgages and student loans are still relatively high, now that the secondary market for consumer debt has shrunk.  Only Treasury yields remain low as investors seek the extra protection they provide.  So it's not like the Fed has massively cut rates and money is sloshing through the system.<p>Second, excessively high interest rates can harm individual consumers.  At the individual level, it means that you pay a higher rate to get a mortgage, buy a car, pay down your student loan, or whatever.  The bigger effect is indirect though: companies can't borrow money to expand their businesses.  This means lower employment growth, lower capital expenditures, less R&D, etc.  People get laid off, paychecks are cut, consumer spending goes down.  By cutting rates, the Fed believes (rightly, in my opinion) that they can at least alleviate these effects, even if it's impossible to prevent them entirely.<p>Lower interest rates aren't even that beneficial to banks.  Banks earn money by lending it out.  If they are forced to lend money at lower rates, they simply aren't going to earn as much revenue from interest.  Wall Street banks also make money through things like trading, merger advisory, debt & equity issuance, etc. -- stuff that isn't really dependent on the absolute level of rates.  A Fed Funds cut is hardly a Wall Street bailout.",1197425386
