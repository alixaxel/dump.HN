88473,comment,88296,88296,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"A recession could potentially benefit startups by making venture capital more attractive than traditional investments.  During a recession, you expect the Fed to lower interest rates, making traditional bonds less attractive.  Stocks won't be very appealing either, since they tend to slide 20-30% in a recession.  The once-enormous market for exotic structured investments (e.g. CDOs, ABS, SIVs, CMOs, whatever) has nearly dried up.<p>People will need somewhere to put their money.  Some will turn to hedge funds and private equity.  Others will turn to distressed debt funds, seeking to pick up the pieces of the recession.  I'm sure plenty of people will turn to venture capital as well.<p>EDIT: That being said, I don't think it matters all that much whether or not we see a recession.  Economic growth certainly isn't going to be great over the next year or so, but does it really matter if the GDP changes by +1% or -1%?  All that's needed for a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth.  I think this is quite likely, but I doubt we will see real pain.  Recent economic stats have been holding up despite the pressure from housing.  Inflation remains moderate in the high 2% range.  The Paulsen subprime rate freeze should help reduce foreclosures and slow house price depreciation.  We'll see how it goes.",1197420829

88471,comment,88296,88394,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"No.  The Dow's large drop today was triggered by the Fed cutting the fed funds target rate by 25 basis points (0.25%).  Stock market investors were hoping that the Fed would cut 50 basis points, giving a further kick to the economy.  However, cutting interest rates by too much at one time can make money too easy, adding to inflation pressures.<p>I work on a trading floor at a major investment bank, and no one near me mentioned the Morgan Stanley report.  My firm has been forecasting a 33% chance of a recession.",1197420445

As projects like Squeak, Rubinius, and the official Java VM have shown, this sort of speed issue can improve independently of the language semantics.",1197420389
88468,comment,88370,88370,0,0,tarkin2,,,"I find grades are only a cursory indicator of intellectual worth. For sure, those who achieved A's are definitely hard-workers and have most probably looked into certain subjects at more depth and breadth (which they'll hopefully remember lest the whole educational experience seems totally worthless to me).   <p>I achieved A's in university. But then I know a guy who did poorly in comparison. Whereas I found what the markers expected of me he found what he wanted to know and explored what he wanted to explore, often deviating with standard practice to the detriment of his grades. <p>Although we are both as competent as each other his university edification seemed far more personally worthwhile; I learnt for the markers and industry he learnt to increase his understanding and capability in areas sometimes not formally rewarded (with marks). <p>I'm sure you can do both: accept the curriculum and learn it for your own benefit. I'm sure this is more or less everyone's ideal. But it seems a lot of people loose focus on their personal edification and concentrate on pleasing their markers. <p>For an example, I'm sure there are courses on XML. You could spend your time becoming adroit in your Schema definition et al or you could spend your time pondering about the general subject in more depth and even rejecting the conventional wisdom. I'd argue the latter course of action is quite valid; but you won't get any marks for it.",1197420266
