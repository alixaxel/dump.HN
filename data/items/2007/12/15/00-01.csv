Laziness and inertia keep me using it.<p>@webwright:  I am a hacker, project manager and biz guy, and I suck at design.<p>@dfens:  Essentially, online shopping lists with some cool algorithms suggesting when you might need what (I notice you haven't bought milk in 2 weeks, would you like to add it to your shopping list?) + suggestions + sms capability (both requests and receipts of your latest shopping lists) + more features tbd.  I have a core set of features that I as a user would like to see, after that point, its whatever makes sense.<p>I welcome more questions and more discussion.  You can either post here or email me at my lame hotmail account.",1197679624

89751,comment,89464,89464,0,0,geebee,,,"One of the best thing about coding positions is that they allow you to enter a new company and start contributing immediately in a very high value way.  If you're good at this, companies will typically heap as much responsibility on you as you can take - largely because the only way the developer can be effective is to gain domain knowledge.  I think that one of the best ways to get to other technical positions is to start as a developer and move into these other roles once you start to understand the business and product <p>(note: I definitely don't view moving out of development as necessarily ""moving up"", just ""moving over"" - in fact, I'd avoid companies that view the software development role as a ""bottom rung"" position.  These companies will write unbelievably crappy software and almost certainly lose any meaningful technology race).    <p>Any reason you don't want to start with the dev position?   You have a technical degree - did you do any programming during it?",1197678815

Musical instruments, medical diagnostics, anything that deals with information processing, which in this day and age, seems to be migrating to a software function.<p>But like I said, can't speak for pg.",1197678753
