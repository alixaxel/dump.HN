92488,comment,92441,92441,0,0,iamwil,,,"At first I thought there was a meaning to the colored numbers, but then I noticed they alternated.  Too bad.  It'd be neat to indicate how fast a story is moving up the list.  However, it'd be completely inaccessible to color blind people.  <p>Anyway, Happy Holidays all.",1198528875

92484,comment,92291,92291,0,0,apathy,,,"Do you need a 'community site' with drop-in modules for stuff like 'post this to Reddit/del.icio.us/YCnews' and 'upload a photo'?   Drupal is good.<p>Is it a custom application with tightly scoped, somewhat unique functionality?  Then use something like Rails or Django.<p><i>DO NOT</i> attempt to use Rails/Radiant for a full CMS, or Drupal for a mostly-AJAX browser-based app.  Trust me on this.  You have been warned.",1198528153

92482,comment,92388,92403,0,0,apathy,,,"Nagios is excellent once you get comfortable with it.  People have written check scripts for all sorts of bizarre hardware, interfaces (RS-232 polling, X10, etc.), and so forth.  You can turn the babysitting proactive by writing event scripts, eg. when a MySQL slave goes out of sync or memcached wedges, the event handler notices, kicks it, and if it doesn't recover after a few tries, <i>THEN</i> you get a page.  Obviously you need to be careful about what you put in an event handler, but used judiciously, they're great.<p>Cacti, ganglia, and so forth are useful adjuncts for routers, clusters, and the like.  But Nagios is a time-tested warhorse with a lot of community support.  It's ugly but it works and works well.<p>PXE + cfengine + nagios can be pulled together for Real Ultimate Power, or at least a simulacrum of what goes on at places like Google (whose scripts are custom Python monstrosities for the most part, but the functionality is pretty similar, with several levels and types of babysitter systems funneling into a more proactive statistical resource allocation type of analysis framework since the scale is so vast; at least that's the track that development was on when I left, and Urs is still in charge so I doubt it's swerved much).  <p>See here for an article on adaptive state monitoring: <a href=""http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/05/25/self-healing-networks.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/05/25/self-healing-n...</a>  with Nagios and Cfengine.  Add something like PXE reimaging of dead nodes to the mix and you cut down workloads by an order of magnitude on large installations.<p>If you are a sysadmin and haven't experimented with self-healing systems, you should fix that gap in your skill set.  If you have a sysadmin who can't or won't, fire him.",1198527702
92481,comment,92470,92470,0,0,shimon,,,"Nifty!  These scripts work by going through the document's img elements, and turning any that are flagged with certain CSS classes into canvas elements.  The image is then loaded into the canvas and manipulated with the proper effects using javascript on the canvas object.<p>Good for hackers who want nice visual effects but hate Flash.  Unfortunately, not free (commercial use restricted).",1198527694
