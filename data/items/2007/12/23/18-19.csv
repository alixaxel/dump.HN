It's more short term vs. long term and, basically, effectiveness.<p>For example, weed relaxes you and if you take it enough you can sustain a relaxed lifestyle. But then you become, to a certain extent, dependent on weed for this relaxed state and I'd rather work on something bereft of such an external dependency, like meditation as previously mentioned.<p>[edit] I am, of course, still assuming that this supposed drug takes over from your internal mechanisms that induce concentration, as opposed to strengthening them, meaning once you stop taking the drug you lose your enhanced concentration. If the drug does strengthen these mechanisms on a long term basis then I'm all for it.",1198435728

I have found that cutting out other activities like watching television and limiting the amount of on-line game playing gave me more time, focus, and energy for work. Thinking about what you can give up or defer to get what you want should be part of any calculation around stimulants to reduce your need for sleep. I still drink a lot of very strong tea (because, for me, the side effects were fewer and less burdensome than coffee) but I don't try and get less than six hours of sleep and know that if I cut it to less than four a price will be paid, if not the next day within two to three days.",1198435702

92237,comment,92136,92136,0,0,skmurphy,,,"A good book on supplements for improving memory and focus<p>""Mind Boosters"" Ray Sahelian M.D\n<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312195842"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0312195842</a><p>It's based on published research (as of 2000) but focuses primarily on reducing ""age related cognitive decline."" It's less for folks in their teens and twenties and more for folks in their 30's and beyond. Dr. Sahelian also stresses the need for regular exercise, sleep, and human contact and connection to keep our brains healthy.<p>Probably the best advice that Sahelian offers is to try one thing at a time, start with the lowest effective dosage and understand what co-factors are needed. In general pre-cursors are safer than re-uptake inhibitors because you are making more of the raw materials available for processing rather than modifying the internal regulation. In particular, if you are trying to boost acetylcholine then CDP, PPC, and GPC have many fewer side effects than the re-uptake inhibitors like Huperzine. <p>I agree with the comment on ""restoring"" vs. ""enhancing"" and would also suggest that everyone has limits (e.g. in their need for sleep) that they would do well to recognize. I personally have found meditation to be something that ""builds mental muscle"" when it comes to stress management and getting through a crunch time with reduced sleep (note: not no sleep) and believe that it's complementary to other methods.",1198434973

One of the great things about the new startup model vs the old corporate-ladder model is that there will be a lot more people who can say this sort of thing.  No manager at a big co would dare to.  But when you get paid upfront you can say what you want (afterward).",1198434248
