93392,comment,93339,93339,0,0,nickb,,,"I think people put too much importance on karma. Personally, I don't really care. I check my RSS feeds 3 times a day (when I have breaks) and I post stuff I find interesting. It literally takes a second to contribute to n.yc (hint: look into bookmarklet link) so why not help a site that I like? So yes, I've accumulated a lot of points. I haven't checked the score in weeks but I assume I'm still in the lead but if pg reset my points, I wouldn't mind at all.<p>I think people think that pg will look at your YC application differently if you have a high karma on the site. I have no idea if that's true (never applied) but some people have said that they had high karma and didn't get accepted. So YMMV. <p>I'd worry more about my app, idea, biz plan than to worry about karma when applying. I doubt pg will accept you just because you contribute to n.yc.",1198895482
