He made some good points about how, despite all the lavish stories, a good number of companies made it through just fine.",1182192325

28938,comment,28703,28905,0,0,gyro_robo,,,"The point you are missing is that WoW becomes <i>more</i> enjoyable if its repetitive, mindless parts are automated.  There would be no point to automating News.YC discussion or going out to dinner, but driving to work surely would be a candidate for automation for most people.  The Skinner Box analogy is directly applicable to mindless, repetitive behavior like clicking to kill monsters over and over again, while thoughtful discussion does not fit into that category.<p>Similarly, you could create a robot to watch movies for you or go on dates for you, but there'd be no point, as you'd be missing out on the enjoyment.  The statement about whether something <i>can</i> be automated refers not to mere physical possibility, but to whether it improves your subjective human experience.  Thus you can't really automate watching movies or going out on dates because you can't have someone else live life for you.  The benefit you gain is all in the <i>experience</i> of it, not the <i>accomplishment</i> of it.<p>The mindless activities these MMOGs subject you to are all of the <i>accomplishment</i> variety.  Those shouldn't even exist, but if they do, they deserve to be automated.  Then people enjoy the <i>experience</i> of being able to engage in the non-mindless activities.<p>The amount of scripting WoW <i>allows</i> is trivial compared to what you can <i>actually</i> do.",1182192164
28937,comment,28550,28822,0,0,neilc,,,"I think there are many examples. A lot of my personal background is in database systems: off the top of my head, non-consumer oriented startups in that domain include startups that are trying to beat Oracle at transaction-processing (EnterpriseDB, MySQL AB to some extent), and a whole bunch of startups in the data warehousing area (Neteeza, Greenplum, ExtenDB, ParAccel, Datallegro, etc.) In data stream processing / complex event processing, there is StreamBase, Coral8, Apama (although they've been acquired by Progress), etc.). There are lots of hard, enterprise technology problems that haven't been solved very well, and that are ripe for entrepreneurs. There are similar problems in data integration, networking, virtualization, security, storage, DRM, etc.<p>And that's without even thinking about vertical markets. For example, I think if you sat down in a room with an industry expert in, say, the oil & gas industry and a few smart hackers, you could come up with a way to apply computer science to improve oil and gas prospecting. There are dozens of similar vertical markets, where some smart hackers with a modicum of domain-specific knowledge could really make a pretty significant improvement on the state-of-the-art, IMHO.<p>The group-think among certain communities on the Internet toward consumer-oriented, Web 2.0, advertising-dependent web startups is really pretty amazing -- I just get terribly bored reading about all the different people building Web 2.0 task management web apps and similar junk. There are lots of other kinds of startups out there -- it's just that YC doesn't focus on funding them, and TechCrunch doesn't cover them, so this particular community of developers never learns about them.",1182191648

28935,comment,28901,28903,0,0,dfranke,,,"Go with Debian stable.  It's rock-solid.<p>I've done very poorly with Ubuntu.  I've tried installing it twice.  The first time, it installed successfully but then when I rebooted it trashed my RAID configuration and dropped into single-user mode.  The second time, which was last week, the installer kept hanging in bizarre places.  The whole distribution just seems to be geared toward very simple hardware configurations and chokes at the slightest violation of its expectations.<p>Also consider a BSD, though.",1182191493

Of late I've had at least one Web2.0 person express an interest in working for us.  I expect we'll find many others who find the web startup scene boring.        <p>",1182190394

28931,comment,28901,28923,0,0,bk,,,"I've been running Debian on a VPS for about two years and the ease of maintenance and overall sensible default security policies make it a great server OS. I'll always go for an OS where my default system is well-tested, stable, and trivial to maintain. I can then spend some time manually installing the latest versions of the two apps (web server and db) whose latest features I may need.<p>It seems to me that Ubuntu is pretty much like Debian with a more shorter upgrade cycle. Is that impression accurate? Also, does Ubuntu have any extra overhead that a Debian system might not have?",1182190361
