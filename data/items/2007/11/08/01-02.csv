77269,comment,77197,77197,0,0,zach,,,"This seems to indicate that a fully-working demo is not what you want to present to YC.  Since all you have is ten minutes, I would think you'd want a more focused form of presentation.<p>Put it this way -- are you a magician?  If you present a demo that effectively says ""pick a card, any card,"" you'd better be.  If you're demoing Google (the site it is today) for YC, it's probably not the best sell to just let someone type anything they want into it.<p>When you only have ten minutes, you need to retain as much control as possible over your message.  Present the article to sell the magazine.",1194487062

77265,comment,76851,76851,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... one key factor between those who succeed as entrepreneurs and those who fail is that those who fail give up too soon, but I've not seen very many suggestions given on how people can develop the ""stick with it"" trait ...""</i><p>You can learn resilience - you have to know and explore your limitations, physically & psychologically. Then push hard!<p>For me there are a number of things to learn though. A combination of both psychological and physical skills.  For the psychology I use techniques that can be summarised in 1 line: <p><pre><code>   SDNT CVS2OBVS QRH PRR\n</code></pre>\nThey are really just a series of techniques to get you pointing in the right direction. It is probably one of the most underused skill-set I picked up in some training [0] in the first startup I worked for.  <p>- SDNT: Start, Do, Notice, Think <p>- CVS2BVS: Current view of Situation 2 Best View of Situation<p>- QRH: Quality, Recognition. Humour<p>- PRR: Practice Repetition Rehearsal<p>A simple toolbox to overcome obstacles. Most revolve around questioning assumptions, finding out what is going on by observation then executing on what is important. [1]   The key insight I gain usually is perspective. Change perspective and you can see things in a different more positive light. Then work out where you need to go and execute.<p>The physical side should not be forgotten. <p>You live in a physical world. Ignore it and it will impact you just as much as the psychological world.  For this I keep reasonable fitness and undertake physical challenges like climbing that hill over there ~ <a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/bootload/tags/mtdandenong"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flickr.com/photos/bootload/tags/mtdandenong</a>  or see how far you can walk before you succumb to hunger or fatigue. Half your battle is going to be the physical world you work in. You may as well know how resilient you are by pushing yourself physically and see how you cope [2]  <p>For me, resilience a combination of both physical stamina and the skills and confidence you develop, used in conjunction with simple psychology techniques.  Combining them allows you to guide your mind, keep it questioning, on track and doing what needs to be done.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.schoolofthinking.org/who/who-dr-michael-hewitt-gleeson/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schoolofthinking.org/who/who-dr-michael-hewitt-gl...</a><p>[1] Download the book for more details ~ <a href=""http://www.schoolofthinking.org/software.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.schoolofthinking.org/software.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/252138977"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/bootload/252138977</a>",1194486495
77264,comment,77246,77246,0,0,german,,,"That's a good point but besides fighting, having at least one co-founder is a great deal (if he/she is a close friend).\nI'm telling this because a lot of startups change their business ideas several times, and sometimes your vision is not the right one.<p>There's one big issue here, if an employee tells you that your company will be better doing X instead of Y is totally your decision,\nit can be right or wrong but that employee will never talk to you about that idea again.<p>Sure, you can have a lot of discussions with your co-founders, but having a combined vision of the project helps a lot.<p>In my case, having one of my best friends as a co-founder is the best thing that ever happened to me.",1194486225

77255,comment,77125,77125,0,0,steve____,,,"I assume you've googled around a bit and found there is no simple answer to this question.  I'd say posting site like this is your best bet.  Do you know what you're looking for?  I ran a successful startup/small company and this is my advise - YMMV.<p>1) you're looking for someone who has similar values yet contrasting /knowledge/skills/abilities (KSA)\nThe similar values makes them a 'potential friend' and that's the best you can aim for.  In the past I made the mistake like so many co-founder do, of connecting with ppl because of our common KSA.  At first it's very easy to get along with someone who is equally passionate about, say, linux.  Over time your conflicting philosophies will lead to a poopy_work_environment(tm)... at which point you'll mostly like start the ""why I hate this person"" list to help validate breaking apart the company.  I assume it's very similar to a marriage/divorce.<p>2) Understand that <i>nothing</i> is more important than the 'who'\nThe person/ppl you choose to build a company with will make you who you're going to become.  If your values are similar you'll agree quickly on possible problems and get up into a high level of creativity when brainstorming solutions.  The process will be rapid and you'll alter your ideas with nothing more than an ""um"" from the other person/co-founder...  You'll know exactly what they're thinking.  You're a product of your environment so nothing is more important to you than the 'who'.<p>3) filtering\nLet's say you get 100 ppl interested in working with you, how do you choose?  I recommend tracking down someone who's studied Industrial and Organizational Psychology.  I was lucky to find two post-grads from a local university (UW) here in Waterloo and they suggested I read the textbook ""Human Resource Selection, 5th ed., by R.D. Gatewood and H.S. Field).  They also assisted with a few filters.  The best I'd say is to create a 'structured interview'.  This will help you interpret a persons values.<p>4) pick a small 'what'\nOnce you've gathered your 'potential friends', choose a small problem/project to work on -- even if it's for free.  Make sure the project is meaty enough (6months?).  The purpose is to alpha-test your startup.  Especially watch how/if you all resolve conflict.  I suggest agreeing before hand on the most pragmatic approach possible...  something like, if we reach an impass than we'll flip a coin... watch how the person who didn't get his/her way responds (especially if that's you).<p>5) try find someone who has already run the race -- successfully!\nImagine this 'potential friend' was someone like pg.  Their insight will handicap your odds of success.<p>\n6) Do not rush it.  At worst get a job at Burger King and wait.<p>I hope that's coherent.  I apologize for the length of this post, it wasn't intended.  If you have further questions, you can email me at dollarsignfoo@gmail.com\n-steve\n",1194484852

If I do decide to make the move, what are the best computer science schools, preferably with significant research in security?  I like the Vancouver area, but I don't think the University of British Columbia would be a good pick for CS.

But in general, at least among the largely growing high school contingent on Facebook, I generally wouldn't expect much sophistication... the interactions I've observed are pretty similar to what you see on MySpace.<p>Facebook is growing in the older-than-college age group too, though, and naturally those users are going to act more like adults. Writing facebook applications is pretty easy, so one great way to test your idea would be to just put out a prototype and see what happens.",1194483674
