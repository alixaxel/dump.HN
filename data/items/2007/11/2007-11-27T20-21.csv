Of working tinyurls (a good chunk are broken) about 30% are maps--which are currently filtered out on the site. <p>I'm not a designer, but did the design myself, so suggestions and bug reports are welcome.",1196196018

I guess it's not Digg-like, but that hardly matters for the reader.<p>I guess the new aspect of this is the personalities involved and that they have blog readerships.  That makes sense, although you wonder if they're going to be talking up their own stuff.<p>And are bloggers going to want to comment on stuff rather than reflexively write a new post on their blog?  I think not.<p>So basically all you get in a ""Blogger's Digg"" is the links.  But wait, you get those from the weblogs themselves.<p>So I think what this should really be describing is DayPop or Blogdex in their salad days.  Anyone remember them?  I know PG does, of course, since they helped inspire reddit.  They basically were replaced by Tailrank.  But TailRank is so broad after the blog explosion that you don't get the ""small community"" of bloggers and certainly lose sight of the individuals.<p>If Tailrank was weighted on the FeedBurner or Technorati rankings and formatted more like reddit, it would probably be just about as useful as any Digg for bloggers like this.",1196195313

84009,comment,83891,83891,0,0,paul,,,"I guess we should have warned everyone :)<p>There's quite a bit of good advice in the presentation.<p>One thing that I didn't see mentioned though is the difference between load-once and reload-on-every-page. Many of the worst JS abuses are from people loading 500k of JS every time the user clicks on anything. Apps such as Gmail or Google Reader only load the JS once then update bits of the page or an iframe as the user clicks around. That has some downsides of course, but it's the only good way to do something that's really JS-heavy.",1196194654

This is not a limitation in CouchDB itself, but in the standard library it uses. This problem will be addressed in a future release.""<p>This seems like a serious hurdle for major adoption.",1196193982
