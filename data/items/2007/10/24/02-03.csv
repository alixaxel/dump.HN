Instead you really should focus entirely on functionality and ignore all considerations of performance until you actually have a problem.  Be a dogmatic anti-premature-optimizer!  You can always throw some hardware at the problem later.  <p>If you are building something that will run on machines you don't control... well, then your problem is a bit different.  If you are doing that <i>and</i> it's a something like a game, which must ""feel right"", well... maybe you should make some decisions up front trading off productivity for runtime performance.  But even in those extreme cases, you are probably better off  fixing speed problems when they come up, not before.  ",1193193397

71922,comment,71760,71811,0,0,sriram_sun,,,"I'm Indian. Got a grad degree from a school in the US. I work in the US. High Tech Migrant Labourer (TM). H1B. Skill Set: you name it I got it ;).\nMost Indians I know would stick to English speaking countries, but the Chinese are a little more flexible as they have to pick up a new language anyways. \nIndians don't really have as many reasons as the Chinese to leave the motherland and stay abroad as politically, it is a lot more ""free"" than China. Both countries are finding it hard to find graduates to employ even in their own countries. So the exodus is not going to happen anytime soon. For right or wrong <i>my</i> perception is that most of EU is not socially evolved enough to become a multi-cultural community like the US (at least the big cities). Most of America is not either. France, no path to citizenship after generations of settling there? No thanks! So I think Denmark is safe for now!<p>But, OTOH, the good thing about being a high tech migrant labourer is aaah choices... choices.. :). If the dollar tanks, now there will only be more countries to choose from.\n",1193192927

A good friend of mine spent years getting good at it: studying, reading, networking like crazy, getting coaching, and he's pretty good now.  Another very important detail:  the corporate sales pipeline is <i>very</i> long.  6 months would be pretty fast to close a sale.",1193192543

71916,comment,71878,71909,0,0,curi,,,"Wouldn't more abortions mean less unwanted children mean less screwed up children mean less crime? Sounds plausible to me -- the main issue is whether this is a big effect or a small (negligible) effect.<p>This lead thing, on the other hand, is silly. It's just a correlation and then they guess there is a causation. Plus some statistics, but people get those wrong all the time, and they still allow for some other thing to cause both.<p>It's especially silly because the thing being explained is so easy to explain. Crime rates are lower in more modern times? Really? Wow. Maybe it's because children are beaten less often, and thus less angry, or any of the many other ways we've become more civilized.<p>Even a correlation with air pollution is pretty easy to explain this way. Maybe the same states that regulate air pollution aggressively are also progressive in other ways.",1193191248
