69859,comment,69811,69811,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I think there are two different questions. One is how we're going to pay for software and the other is how software is going to be made available and kept up to date technically. Regarding the latter, it doesn't look like there will be that binary choice between web and desktop for 10 more years so I'm not sure what exactly Adobe is going to drop. Local storage? Access to USB devices? I don't think so. It will become a matter of interpretation by marketing folks whether a particular application is called a web app or a desktop app. I mean that's what AIR is all about, isn't it?",1192736777

I have a mild preference for RPN calculators over infix ones, just because it makes it a little easier to keep track of what I'm entering on calculators whose displays are just one row of seven-segment numerals.  On computers or on nicer calculators I couldn't care  less. I'm equally comfortable with prefix, infix, and postfix and can easily transpose between notations in my head.",1192736459

That's what makes them professions.<p>If it was easy, then people would just do it as part of other activities, and there would be no specialization worth of the title profession. We don't think of typing in URLs as a profession, or spell checking documents, but we do think of graphic design or architecture as professions.<p>Programmers are operating close to the limit of human capability, just as other professionals are. Only a few people can do it well because it's a talent which is unequally distributed, just like being able to draw.<p>As for why this particular activity pushes that limit?

Right now 3 out of 4 of the world's super cranes are in China, constructing new office towers. The Chinese are holding something like a trillion dollars that we've traded them for TVs and such. The Chinese military is building a deep-water navy, and China keeps making no-so-subtle threats against Taiwan. In addition, the Chinese have a tendency to build up a lot of nationalistic anger whenever they feel threatened, whether the threat is real or imagined.<p>
Now the kicker is exactly as you describe: they cannot scale. Their system is rotten and broken, and the only reason it's still working is that they ""sold out"" to capitalism, effectively creating an oligarchy just like in the bad old days.<p>
But how would an implosion occur? There's good money that says that the worse things get, the more China is going to be looking for somebody else to get into a tangle with -- what better way to keep people's attention elsewhere. The blame has to go somewhere, and it can't be the leadership. There's an easy case to be made that China could blame it's impeding implosion on lack of cheap resources, favored-trading status of Taiwan, Japanese hegemony, United States imperialism -- pick your bad guy. In a pressure cooker the steam has to go somewhere.<p>
That's the worry.",1192734251
