I imagine quite a few others here would as well.  With enough feedback, you could probably find common themes and have something to run with.<p>The big question: how to share you application with others?  I don't see a problem of cutting and pasting it into a new thread and asking for feedback.  You run the risk of sharing your secrets with the world.  Also, this approach may not sit well with ycombinator themselves.<p>Any thoughts?

Sometimes you just have to build it and see but I think you could be onto something.<p>If you do it, try to integrate visual ways of showing that the app is working, and spend effort on getting that key first answer incredibly fast.  Another question to ask yourself is if you want someone to wait and watch the answers come in, or if they'll come back  in an hour to see what came in.  That decision is crucial to how you build the app.<p>This article might be of interest:  <a href=""http://www.seo24.org.uk/how-yahoo-or-facebook-could-really-kill-google.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seo24.org.uk/how-yahoo-or-facebook-could-really-k...</a>   Most isn't relevant, but skip down to the text ""Think of it this way - today's search engines answer three basic questions:""  <p>It's talking about <i>exactly</i> the problem you're solving, and the value you're providing.

Besides, our potential clients already gave up on Google when they are coming to us.  #2 - well, maybe yes, maybe not.  We make it easier.  And #1 - not much people have hundred of friends on IM.

I'd like to buy a gaming console, but I don't know which one.  I have close to 100 of active contacts in my IM, but barely few of them know something about gaming consoles.

I've been living in Boston a few years, working on a TN for a slightly larger company, and haven't had problems at the border.<p>However, the situation potentially gets a little trickier when a start-up is involved, as one is not supposed to be self-supporting - you need to have a paying job.  However, I believe that in principle, there isn't any reason that one can't hold an equity stake in a company that employs you.<p>I am already in Boston and working with a co-founder here, which is the biggest reason I need to be in the US.  Moreover, the access to smart capital and to our target market is significantly greater here (Boston, SF, and NYC).

I lived in the city for a little while after moving here, but after my car got broken into TWICE in one month, (even my sunglasses were stolen), and a couple of way too expensive parking tickets and even getting towed on one occassion, I decided to go migrate south.  Very glad I did; it's <i>much</i> cleaner, there are more trees, less crime, and notably fewer crazies.  It's easier to hear yourself think, too.  Rent is not really any less than you pay in the city, but you seem to get more  -- as in square feet -- breathing room, etc.",1193167203

71759,comment,71127,71315,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"There is no ""system administrator"" college degree...so you pretty much get to decide when you're equipped to be an IT consultant, and what your time is worth.  Of course, repeat business is the only way you'll make decent money, so you'd not want to exaggerate your accomplishments.  But, ""serious Linux nerds"" means people who are capable of setting up mail, DNS, web, users, LDAP/NIS/Samba, NFS/CIFS, and hooking it all up in such a way that it can operate without you present (I always used Webmin for this aspect--it has great ACLs so you can give as much or as little privilege as your customer needs to be able to create/manage users without breaking anything, for example).<p>Even if you're not an expert at all of these things, if you know what they're for and can read the documentation and make all of them work in an afternoon, then you're well-equipped (better equipped than many Microsoft ""certified"" techs) for the job.  Most small businesses don't even know what they need, much less how to set it all up.  So, when you go in, you'll find that they have no idea what you're doing, why you're doing it, or how it all fits together.  How you explain it is more important than how you implement it when it comes to whether you're called back or recommended to other businesses.  It has to work, of course, but as long as you're explaining the job clearly and in simple terms, the customer will remain happy (try to look busy, as well...sometimes you'll be waiting for installs and such...do something else during that time, even if it's busy work).<p>Note that I'm not necessarily recommending this path.  IT support sucks.  It's a very stressful field, where the only time you hear from people is when there's a problem.  In fact, the only time you hear from people is when there is a problem so severe that they can't get work done (people are so afraid of computers, and of thinking about technology, that they'll ignore trouble signs until the breakage is complete).  Thus, your customers are almost always stressed out.  I frequently worked for a company that had a quarter million in daily revenues, and so a day with all of their people off-line cost them significant sums of money.  I have great respect for the fellow who built and owned the place, as he kept his cool like a champ, no matter how tight the downtime schedules were...but some of his employees (and share holders) did not.<p>Oh, yeah, you'll also work a lot of nights and weekends, because that's when companies can afford to be completely off-line.",1193166991
