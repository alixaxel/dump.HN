I include bot networks in my definition of spammers as they're a source of spam, though I appreciate not everyone else does. <p>Yes, most DNS blacklists takes care of bot networks. Most also provide a web based query tool.<p>To identify spam sources, DNS based blacklists look at mail headers from trusted users. Some DNS blacklists may also use honeypots with accounts that should never be contacted.  ",1191380243
62429,comment,62348,62415,0,0,cirroc,,,"Thanks- That's certainly an avenue I'll look into.. It looks like they do the SBA loans that I had mentioned, but also do their own private loans, which might be an option.<p>We have two people in our team- If I could get a Chase loan to allow our lead coder to go full-time, and keep my job to make the payments, we could be OK until launch.<p>It's not optimal, but it might let us get the time we need to launch successfully and quickly.<p>I'm very open to any other ideas, and appreciate the discussion.",1191380158

62427,comment,62405,62418,0,0,rms,,,"No, I haven't come close, I just got suckered in when I was looking at different hosting companies and they had the best numbers. One difference between them and other ""unlimited"" hosting is that I think they do mean it -- I asked them if they had a simultaneous connection limit or any of the tricks other shared hosting providers used to cut people off that use to much bandwidth and they said no.<p>I would switch to a $20/month VPS like slicehost that provides a tenth as much bandwidth but I don't really need to set up my own services at this point and I don't have much motivation to switch, though I really should before my startup is launched. Latency is kind of bad too, my sites just feel slow when they load.",1191380036

62425,comment,62348,62385,0,0,cirroc,,,"Fair point, but we need to do something. I'd love any ideas- We're Mass based, and we've got the code about 80 percent done, depending on how you count. We've got users who are ready to pay when we launch, and we've got a decent potential for growth, but we know we're unlikely to be the next Google with this project.<p>In some ways, we're working to get the bugs out of our Engines, and working on our bona fides, so we can buy google with the proceeds from out NEXT project ;)<p>",1191379953
62424,comment,62348,62401,0,0,cirroc,,,"Alright- You seem to be in the consensus on the news.yc board, and I'm coming around to your viewpoint. That being said, what are the alternatives? I'm already working 65 hours a week on my primary job, which I need to pay rent and the server costs, art costs, etc for the startup.. Then I'm putting in another 30-35 a week on the startup (12 on Sat + 12 on Sun + 4ish Tues-Wed-Thurs)..<p>I can't really take another job- I just don't have time to do that, and actually code anything.\nApproaching AAs is hard, since the product isn't as ""Sexy"" as a lot of things. It's likely to a good few hundred K per year after we get it going, but it's not the next Microsoft. <p>Do you have any ideas on where else to look? Is there something outside the AA route, or even a sub-niche within in we should look at?\n",1191379943
62423,comment,62348,62370,0,0,cirroc,,,"Hrmm.. Very fair points, both on outside investors, and on CAPCOS. With outside investors, I know we'd get a better valuation if we could launch, and start bringing in revanue before we go out knocking on doors. Investing in a dream and a codebase is one thing, but seeing the numbers on paper has to help.\n",1191379903
62422,comment,62348,62378,0,0,cirroc,,,"You can if you put your personal assets and reputation at stake instead. To a degree, this is what you're doing in a startup anyway. You're putting your money, time and energy on the line, and hoping for a reasonable return on that. <p>Granted, you may be right in that it's not worth it for many projects. The project we're working on isn't as sexy as some though, and is unlikely to take over the world. What it does have is a moderate number (300ish) of users ready to sign on as paying customers at launch, and a good chance to tripling that within 6 months. Those aren't retire to Tahiti numbers, but they're enough to pay for dev.<p>Those sort of numbers make it hard to approach most AAs, who want to see a 10:1 investment:return\n",1191379884
62421,comment,62405,62405,0,0,stillmotion,,,"Sick of Dreamhost, I turned to MediaTemple today. I knew that spending an extra $7 on my existing $10-a-month bill wouldn't be a problem, but I just had a bad feeling about it.<p>I successfully switched 12 domain names in under 3 hours, and focused on getting mail and everything else working. As I was working it struck me, why the hell did I sign up with this host? Understanding that their (GS) systems are based on one domain, with a piggy back system of extra ""containers"" for applications, I realized that I bought myself into a crappy host that I will not enjoy throughout my time with them.<p>I am not hating on (MT), but as a liberal developer, I believe that XPanel with a pretty skin is not the host for me.",1191379842
62420,comment,62348,62380,0,0,cirroc,,,"That's fair, but at the same time, I'm hesitant to agree, on a few ground-<p>1) You're certainly right that banks have nothing to go on. My credit isn't amazing, but its certainly decent enough that I could probably manage a small loan from the banks on personal credit alone. It would provide a few months float money, at the least.<p>2) You've argued heavily before that there needs to be an element of becoming personally committed[1], providing motivation. Having a Personal Loan over your head is certainly one way to do that.<p>3) Are there other options? Raising Angel money would be more difficult for us that for some projects, because we're not as Sexy as we could be.. We sent in a yCombinator proposal that was very ambitious, but were rejected, so we scaled back to what we thought we could achieve on our own.<p>We're doing a pretty decent job on it, but its not going to be the next Google, or even the next Scribd. Most Angel Investors seem likely to want to back a sexier horse, so to speak.<p>We do have a dedicated group of users waiting to sign up for paid subscriptions, and we know we could hit profitability reasonably quickly, but how do we get from here to there?<p><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/die.html</a><p>\n",1191379839

62412,comment,62368,62393,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"Hmm. I don't want to step on any toes, so I'm just going to answer somewhat generally.<p>There are many smart people at iRobot, and most of em have many crazy ideas. Because the Home Robots side doesn't get  government funding, iRobot needs to invest a fair amount into a product before it sees a customer. That means that the market potential needs to be vetted before proceeding. All of this is pretty intuitive.<p>They've turned around this product really fast. That's what iRobot is good at: making something that actually works, really quickly.<p>Like many companies, employees are early testers of the products.<p>One VERY smart guy at the company once quipped: ""robotics is the study of the failure modes of connectors"". <p>It's sad because it's so true.",1191378550
62411,comment,62377,62377,0,0,queensnake,,,"Personally I kind of do it like an artist, not meaning to be pretentious, but like an artist 'dabs' the spatially-defining features of a painting first, I'll code or pseudo-code, first, parts that are the most 'interesting' or that I'm most uncertain about. Thus I hit the bottom places that change the design the most, early. At least that's the intent. I will still hit some unforeseen detail that knocks some larger organization out, but, I do find that defining the 'interesting' parts makes it that much easier to fill in the rest. ",1191378379

They might be for restaurants and brick-and-mortar businesses, but I don't think it's a wise idea, since those also fail.  They are not for technology startup companies, and not just because they don't want to loan you money.<p>There are angels who will give you convertible debt at reasonable terms, if they like what you're doing.  But, it's probably wise to give up a little equity to get someone with some money savvy working towards your success, and that's one of the benefits of raising money from investors that work with tech startups.<p>In short: Banks don't want you, and you don't want them.
