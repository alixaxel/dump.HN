64603,comment,64537,64598,0,0,aston,,,"ING Direct pays out less than HSBC, and I'm sure a host of other e-savings account that spend less to advertise. That said, I think you're right about them having a lucrative referral program. When I spoke with Patzer about it last summer, they were one of the big ones he mentioned.",1191815353
64602,comment,64425,64590,0,0,far33d,,,"ardit, no offense, but your lack of knowledge about the etymology of the word is apparent. I hate to jump onto this flame-bait, but here's the real definition of a ""hacker"" from the illustrious jargon file: <p><pre><code> 1. A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities, as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet Users' Glossary, usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of a system, computers and computer networks in particular.
 
 2. One who programs enthusiastically (even obsessively) or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming.

64598,comment,64537,64596,0,0,rms,,,"Yeah...    their affiliate programs pay insane kickbacks, ING Direct is around $100 dollars per new account with an additional $50 bonus to the person that opens a new account and they offer the best savings account rate in the USA, so Mint should get lots of signups.",1191814832
64597,comment,64425,64577,0,0,djb,,,"Thanks for the advice (and thanks to the others who responded to my post). I think I'll still give K&R a shot, possibly with the notes a13x recommended (I haven't had the time to check them out yet), because I don't want to buy another book right now. If I find that I'm not getting excited about programming or not learning well from K&R, I'll switch to Python.",1191814344

It's ""how do I price this to maximize the odds of success and the dollar worth of my share.""<p>If you do very well and sell for $10m, the <i>practical</i> difference between 33% and 50% in terms of your quality of life is quite small.<p>On the other hand, a feeling of uneven split between founders, particularly as the start up moves further and further from the basic concept you started with, is a potential contributor to a ""50% of nothing is nothing"" situation.<p>Once the game starts, it doesn't matter who put what on the table: if you're not actively getting screwed get your head down and focus on making what you ""own"" worth something, rather than worrying about how the loot is divided.

Maybe %2-%5 of the company, MAX. <p>That 2-5% is worth only if you come with something novel + a plan and strategy how to make it happen, and some contacts-help.<p>If all you say let's ""do a music application for kids under 12"", that is worth nada.",1191813497

64590,comment,64425,64425,0,0,ardit33,,,"I am so tired of hearing this word ""hacker"".   Use, programmer, software engineer, coder whatever.<p>There are appropreate times to use the word ""hack"",  when i am doing something really quick and dirty, just b/c it needs to get out asap,  but probably I am not really proud of my solution, as it probably less maintanable on the long run.<p>When you heare phrases like:  I did something ""hackish"", or my bug fix is kinda of a ""hack"", usually are not something programmers are proud of.  Usually that means I did a quick and dirty solution to that problem, and not an elegant one.<p>In an early startup, i guess, being quick is the most important thing,  but after a while you have to start caring about the long term of the code you are writting or end up like friendster, where their poor performance killed the company.<p>A good programmer will use a ""hack"" only as a last resort.

64589,comment,64425,64577,0,0,dfranke,,,"C maybe isn't the easiest choice of a first language, but I disagree that it's a bad one.  No single language will make you a good programmer, because a good programmer needs to be capable of thinking in high-level abstractions and also needs to understand what goes on close to the metal.  No language that I know of is good for both of those (Forth comes closest), and C is excellent for the latter.",1191813020

There are many countries in europe that have very different labour laws and regulations.<p>South\Eastern Europe is now the place with the most growth,  like an ""up and comming"" neighborhood, and you can get away with a lot more there.<p>Back home, most of my friends that have ""starter"" jobs, are actually doing it under the rug.  Go to work, regurarly, get paid, but they don't officially result in the payroll of the company  (to avoid all the obligations that come with it).<p>After a couple of years of work, once you gained some experience you move there, or somewhere else in a more stable status.<p>I am assuming a startup will probably be the same.  First years it will all be under the rug.  Remember, laws are made to be broken to a certain extent,  but they also prevent large companies from treating employees just as a disposable thing, with no rights, no vacation, no health care, no paid maternity leave as you have in the US.   <p>Sure some large companies do provide them, but some don't (ala Walmart), and this nation leaves it's citizen under the mercy of capitalism  (which just wants you healthy enough to perform your duties).<p>Remember, Europeans work to live, Americans live to work.",1191812738
