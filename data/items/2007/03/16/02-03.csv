The best example I can think of is the repackaging of 80's nintendo games in a single joystick you plug into the TV.  \n",1174013648
4518,comment,4324,4324,0,0,goodgoblin,,,"Another downside to incorporating as an LLC is that it makes it harder to try someone out when you are considering trading equity for services.  If you want to see if a lawyer is going to be a good fit, or if a SEO person is going to really help you out, there is no immediate corrolary to vesting in an LLC.  So it makes hiring fast/firing fast difficult to do.  You don't want a large chunk of your company held up by someone if it turns out the designer you gave 2% in leui of cash to design your UI is actually a complete flake.\n",1174013588

I plan on using it in the next project, but I don't have the Experience yet.<p>\nBeyond the fact that it's open, there's also that you can tie in other JS libs- So you have a lib you really like, you can import it's functions into JS, and use them as part of your application.<p>And while I agree that you could hack up the HTML/JS, that'd get really hairy for complex stuff- Although I think some people are doing that now to break things up better into modules.",1174011553

Reminds me of a certain information minister for both coherence and modesty:<p><a href=""http://welovetheiraqiinformationminister.com/"">http://welovetheiraqiinformationminister.com/</a><p>He's a good businessman, though. He took an early lead in the PC business and turned it into this generation's Sony Walkman knockoff + an overpriced Intel machine running Unix. Oh, and Wired magazine thinks his utterances are ""insanely great"":<p>""The products suck! There's no sex in them anymore!""<p>Steve, I owned an Apple II. There wasn't a mother Theresa pinup calendar's worth of sex in it.",1174011433
