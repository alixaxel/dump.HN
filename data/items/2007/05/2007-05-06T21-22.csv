Would you have kept your PR firm in 2007, switched to Google Adsense, or both?  Also, did you do any advertising at the time, or have affiliates or resellers of your service, other than PR?  I seem to remember VIAWEB banner ads.  Thanks.",1178488267

But it gives me something to hone my skills on and stops my brain from turning to mush while I wait for my Green Card.<p>I've been putting some more effort into it recently.  I'd be interested to know if people here have suggestions for what I could improve.  Please feel free to consider no nit too small to pick.<p>Some stats:<p>Lispdoc responds to around 3000 searches per day on average.<p>Its Google page-rank is 4/10<p>Alexa rank is 568,856 (three weeks ago it was 1,130,856.  current 1 wk avg is 228,583)<p>A Google search for 'lisp documentation' puts lispdoc in 7th place.",1178486687
