Do you like to build something like a... robot that goes around and... huh... does stuff for people that people themselves don't want to do?<p>I am sorry, but most of the ideas I hear from non-tech people are pretty much like that :-)<p>Man, you have to realize that ideas worth nothing. Seriously: ZERO. <p>What counts is the best possible implementation. Facebook is not the first social network and google wasn't the first search engine.<p>Sorry to disappoint.",1188031436

While a hacker may be able to hear the voice of the customer, it probably makes sense to have some folks that do more hacking and some more customer hearing.  If you have two co-founders, it makes sense to have one on each side.  ",1188030337
46531,comment,46024,46398,0,0,altay,,,"I'm in the same boat - a recovering 'ideas guy' who buckled down and actually learn to hack over the past year or so.  (One of the best decisions I've ever made.  Though, granted, I developed a real passion for it.)  I'm enjoying Ruby/Rails, but will probably check out Python next, because so many smart people seem to gravitate to it.<p>BUT, that said, I'm going to commit hacker heresy and recommend that you consider starting with Javascript.  Here's why:<p>Hackery reasons:<p>- it's how I learned object-oriented programming<p>- it's how I learned functional programming. (well, ok, a little bit of Scheme helped, too.)<p>Practical reasons:<p>- in any project, no matter what the backend is, you're <i>always</i> gonna need JS on the front end<p>- with the rise of rich UIs (ajax and whatnot), people who really know their JS are in demand, and it's a niche that most hackers don't focus on<p>- you can learn from studying thousands of other real-world programs. (when you see something cool on some website, just pop open the hood -- or, rather, pop open firebug -- to see how it works.)<p>- it's the layer that's closest to the user.  this forces you to keep everything in context while you hack.<p>- you said you're a good listener.  empathy is key to UI design, so you might find this to be a good place to mix your strengths with code.<p>Ok, now all you <i>real</i> hackers can tear me apart for recommending a toy language.  ;-)",1188030171
