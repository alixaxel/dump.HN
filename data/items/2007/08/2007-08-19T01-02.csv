43957,comment,43942,43942,0,0,Darmani,,,"You might consider asking for a zip code rather than a city. I personally live in an unincorporated area of Saint Louis county, and I was quite tempted to name one of the three surrounding suburbs (all of which are politically considered a city). While the decision  to just put down ""Saint Louis"" came easily, I'm wondering how much internal debate I would have had had I lived in an unincorporated area in the middle of nowhere.<p>And then, of course, there's also the reason that just typing in a zip code is easier.",1187488306

43954,comment,43635,43783,0,0,Goladus,,,"On the other hand, I've been a member of a loosely-moderated community for close to 7 years and it's still going strong (I think the forum first opened in 1999).  There is a lot of what might be considered ""trite"" to a casual observer, but for those of us who have been reading and posting there for a long time we simply ignore the content we're not interested in.  There's always enough good stuff to keep me going back.  <p>It definitely was never overrun with ignoranuses, at least not for any extended period of time.",1187487768

All my other grad school friends tried to warn me, but I didn't listen.<p>In school you're busy 24/7: doing schoolwork, worrying about schoolwork, or procrastinating on schoolwork.  At least when I was working full-time, I would leave the office at 5-ish and not worry about work for 16 hours.",1187487158

Because the posts tend to get long and drawn out I created this.  It's simple and just a start, but it should provide us a base for finding others in our area.  If people use it, I'm thinking about adding a location based forum section.",1187486454
43943,comment,43793,43924,0,0,rzwitserloot,,,"Interesting. Shame the rebuttal contains no references, whereas Dyson's is littered with them.<p>Though - the idea that global climate change, even if it ends up making the world a better place, will undoubtedly lead to tension and possibly even war, is almost axiomatic, and something Dyson glossed over.
