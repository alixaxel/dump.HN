I'm open to linking off of my site to a hosted provider, so long as I can sufficiently customize the look-and-feel. I'm also open to a lower-level code-it-yourself type of solution. Of course I don't want to spend too much time on this, and I want it to be cheap. :) Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences.",1186768690

It <i>does</i> look like Hitler's basement (ie bunker).<p>It looks like they're in a wartime bunker, probably with bombs going off overhead, all the while blissfully demoing web applications.

41297,comment,41133,41227,0,0,stuki,,,"	The point I was trying to make is that since processors now almost exclusively gain performance by adding cores rather than by speeding up each individual core, a per socket license lets the customer continue to keep the gains from processor evolution.<p>	With Oracle's per core license, if you swap out your dual cores for quads, you owe twice (or thereabouts) as much in license fees, essentially guaranteeing your (some processor performance metric) / (license fee) ratio no longer increases over time.\n",1186766305

However, it has been successful for one of the founders of Zenter who just found out they were expecting a baby the day he applied to YC.  <p>Working on projects on the side is great, but if you're in a market with other competitors, you might watch them pass you by.<p>Anyone know how many YC founders quit their normal jobs after applying and accepting funding?",1186765764
