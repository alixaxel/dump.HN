46879,comment,46878,46878,0,0,rms,,,"I've been running the Firefox 3 alpha for a while now. It's gotten much more stable over the last couple weeks. I'm down to less than a crash a day now.<p>I find Firefox 2 to be almost unusable because rendering lots of complex Javascript and Flash eats up an enormous amount of memory. Firefox 3's rendering engine is much better; I'd recommend everyone try it and see if it works for them. There are some other nice new features, like URL auto completion suggesting your most commonly visited sites/directories first.<p>Use this tool to force your extensions to work with Firefox 3. <a href=""http://www.oxymoronical.com/web/firefox/nightly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oxymoronical.com/web/firefox/nightly</a>",1188186923

46868,comment,46845,46853,0,0,palish,,,"Wow.  You're awesome<p>1) Colors: Yes. <p>2) Tag Cloud: Ehh.. Tag clouds seemed a little annoying, but it might be better than a straight table view.<p>3) Relative times instead of absolute times (""5 minutes ago""..): Strongly agree.  Implemented.<p>4) Okay.  I'll try to figure out how to make things more obvious for new users.<p>5) Hmm. Yeah, that is confusing.  Whenever you're doing something (for example, ""run"") and you make a post about it, that post gets added to the ""run"" chaingang.  From there, other people can read it and upvote it.  If you happened to upload a picture along with it, that picture is displayed as a thumbnail.<p>6) That's for upvoting user content.  It's probably less obvious on Chain than it is on say, YCombinator or Reddit.<p>7) Hm.. You can choose the interval time on the next page.  I wanted to keep the frontpage as simple as possible, so I didn't include a dropdown time interval there.<p>8) Yes, a FAQ is probably way more useful than an About page.<p>9) The +0 represents how many community points you have.  I need to represent it differently.  This is tied in with, ""How do I encourage users to moderate images?""  The idea was you'd earn community points for moderating images, then it would be displayed next to your name whenever you posted a comment or a cheer.  However, that's a little confusing too..<p>10) I was thinking consistency was better than making a new icon for that, and the consistent part is that it <i>looks</i> like a link.  It looks like something you can click on.  Whereas the uparrow does not, but I was hoping people would figure it out.  But maybe an icon is required.<p>11) Yeah, I'm going to add cookie-based authentication so that you can stay logged in.  That's a great idea to make the first thing you see be your own chains.<p>12) No way, not offensive or anything.  That was <i>exactly</i> the kind of criticism I was looking for. Thank you so much!  Got any more?",1188183899
