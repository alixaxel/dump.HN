My basic take is that he has both a unique philosophy of business/life and a unique way of thinking/problem_solving, and he gets his enjoyment out of applying this to other people's problems. It would be interesting to make a meta-cognitive model of his problem solving process. ",1177473171

The nonexistent problem is ""they seek the disk head to some specific location and then read or write my name to that location.""  I may have missed it, but I haven't seen you admit yet that you were wrong.  You've been informed now that reads use a memory cache and writes use a write-ahead log, right?",1177473156

It's the bright pastel highlight thing before it was hip.<p>I agree we can learn something about design from the whole thing.  The simplicity means that it holds up strikingly well.  The only thing that really dates it is the image buttons and image bullets.  Nice job, Paul, or whoever did the design.  It's really very nice.",1177471365

16528,comment,16270,16270,0,0,marketer,,,"What's the incentive to share ideas? The satisfaction of getting them off your chest to people who build businesses off them? I doubt very many people would do that. I would only ever consider submitting my ideas to two types of people:<p>1) very close friends/potential cofounders<p>2) people who can help me build it (investors, etc..)<p>I don't think this site has the right interface because people are naturally protective of ideas that can make money.",1177470555

16526,comment,16375,16375,0,0,skittles,,,"I'm an auditory learner.  I prefer to read at a conversational pace while <i>hearing</i> the words in my head.  In an academic setting, I learn much more from listening than by note-taking.  I go into some sort of zen-like state when taking notes that I don't get into while just listening.  It's like my ears tell my hand what to write without my brain processing the information.  If I put my pen down and listen (and participate when appropriate), I retain a high percentage and usually don't need to study later.  I wish I knew this sooner about myself.  It would have saved a lot of wasted effort.\n",1177470107
