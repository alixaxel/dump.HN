It is a huge loft. The downside - you share a bathroom with everyone else on the floor, like a college dorm. And, the building is conveniently located between a porno theatre and an alley full of meth tweakers.<p>The usual option is to find a share on craig's list.

<a href=""http://www.pennylicious.com/2006/10/09/billionaire-dropouts/"">http://www.pennylicious.com/2006/10/09/billionaire-dropouts/</a><p>Bill Gates, Paul Allen, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Richard Branson, et al.  This doesn't include hundred-millionaires, like Woz, who went back to college and got a degree afterward.<p>Having ""something to fall back on"" (a degree) seems a bit like saying, ""not living your dreams is acceptable"".  Obviously one can be successful with a degree as well; but we're a product of our circumstances, and how hard we try tends to depend on how hard we <i>have</i> to try.<p>Looked at another way, the effort you expend from 18-22 to get a degree may well be frittering away some of your most energetic and productive years.  Assuming your course of study is actually difficult and rigorous, your degree is a real accomplishment, and to be lauded; yet it does not directly yield positive financial results.<p>It seems easier to go back to school later and follow a prescribed course of study on a regular schedule than to found a start-up at a later age, with all its unpredictability and long hours.<p>Electing not to obtain a degree is to accept a set of obstacles and challenges in dealing with others who place a premium on third-party certifications.  The connection with entrepreneurship is apparent:<p>entrepreneur: a person who organizes and manages any enterprise, esp. a business, usually with considerable initiative and risk.

Some (like you) don't even waste time feeling bad, you get right back to it. Others don't. My point is that if you do feel bad, fine. Feel bad and move on. You're going to move on eventually, so just do it quicker.<p>",1176513389

In the Boston area, $15K is easily savable in a year, for a single person fresh out of college.  <p>In my graduating class, about 1/3 took jobs in engineering, consulting, or finance that pay $60-$80k (more in finance).  The remaining 2/3 became graduate students, temp workers, secretaries and teachers making $20-30k/year.  The ones making $60-80k don't live significantly more extravagant lifestyles (actually, I see far more engineers and consultants living with their parents than secretaries and teachers), so they pocket the $40K/year difference.<p>What's a typical salary for a talented computer programmer in Alabama?  Are there particular barriers to relocating to Boston or SF or Redmond or Austin and getting a decent salary?",1176512607
