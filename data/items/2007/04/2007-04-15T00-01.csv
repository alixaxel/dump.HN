It is only idea as of now, and I'm looking for skilled people to make this idea a reality, such as a demo.<p>However, I am hesitant to just explain my idea and post it throughout the internet in hopes of attracting people for fear that someone can just run with the idea on their own. I mean, I am just the idea guy with creativity, they're the coder, they can live without me, but I can't live without them.<p>How do you suggest I lure coders without exposing too much about the site's idea?<p>How do I convey that good pay will probably not be the case, rather that he/she will be a partner in the startup, without turning away possible applicants?",1176598799

The ""incomprehensible marketing speak"" line was aimed at the non-research IBM web pages I've seen, btw, not at Ars Technica :-)  ...'</i><p>Whoops, sorry. Your summary looks okay. The system allows you to be used to verify your identity (verification) anonymously unlike openid, an 'identity provider'.",1176598666
12996,comment,12995,12995,0,0,arasakik,,,"I've found that the most effective way to come up with ideas is to spend some time alone writing down ideas, usually ""aha!"" moments that occur while I am doing something completely unrelated. Usually the idea scratches a personal itch I have. After that, I've found that bouncing the idea off of co-founders helps to assert (or reject) that it is a valid business opportunity. How about you guys? What methodology works best for you?",1176598637

Further information about product details, etc. can be discussed upon further contact. ...'</i><p>Do you have a demo? a blog? or something you can show?  Build, talk create an audience and the <i>long tail</i> of the Internet will work for you. [0]<p>Not having something, anything to show  is counter to what's really going on at the moment in the web where there is an avalanche of interesting things going on. You have to market yourself [0], no not market, make a statement.  Here are the words I use to motivate myself here ...<p><i>'... Momentum builds on itself -- just start. Do whatever you can. Draw a user interface. Write a spec. Make something, anything, that people can see and touch and try. A prototype is worth ten thousand words. ...'</i> [1]<p>More releases (code, blogs, demos), less searching. This is not a criticism, just an observation. Remember we are in a boom so lots of really interesting things are happening. You have to compete and show your stuff by releasing and listening to your audience. <p>

I've posted fliers, posted on craigslist, talked to professors, etc. looking for skilled programmers to help me get this startup in development, but I haven't received a single response.<p>I grow exponentially frustrated day after day and feel like I have exercised all my options. If any of you have any suggestions on how you or your team found a coder, it'd be greatly appreciated.<p>For anyone who happens to have coincidentally come across this and is a coder, I am based in Orange County / San Diego  , CA.

12986,comment,12932,12932,0,0,bootload,,,"I had a quick demo and as a substitute word processor I was <i>underwhelmed</i>. There are little things that bugged me like the clunky spell check,  the lame privacy details that don't let you remove your documents (even if you leave) the monitoring of your documents. If you upload a file (in my case a OpenOffice doc) it misses grabbing the title from the document itself.  They also missed the <i>print</i> functionality. I don't want to download a doc to have to print it. [0]<p>If you've created a document and want to edit with others it looks ok. I <i>did</i> like the way the worked with the screen (lots of whitespace), revised documents, the input parser for various documents, the atom feed. The fact you could export the data in various formats and support for UTF-8.  I missed the point of it being a collaborative blog tool.  That certainly is a useful feature but not a killer.<p>Then I took into account the fact it's a new product. Bare minimum to get launched. It's not going to be used for corporates for security & privacy reasons.  But if you have to create something with someone else in a different location it will get usage.<p>That's from a user perspective. From an application perspective it's slick & I wonder how they got such a service up and running so fast. [1]  It does not take the radical steps of say Rael's stickit, [2] making little affordances as the user enters data, remembering it and getting the application to help you. [3]  I also miss an API. But it's early days.<p>I wonder how they intend to make money off it? Expanded functionality, number of documents you can create, edit. Guess there is plenty of scope for this.<p>
