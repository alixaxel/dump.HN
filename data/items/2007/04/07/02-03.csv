Trying to get in touch with interesting startups with demos for an app we're building. Also if you have an online demo or want to help me find people with cool demos email me, appreciate the help: sumon [at] zintilla [dot] com",1175914458

IE7 is their attempt to get their ass in gear for precisely that reason. The market's not going to stick around and wait for IE and the web will progress whether MSFT wants it to or not.",1175914238

9850,comment,9770,9770,0,0,brad,,,"This is a very thought provoking essay.  Very forward thinking.  I agree with many of the things that you say, but the fact of the matter is that much of the economy - domestic and global - runs in a Windows environment.  Most consumers still run Windows.  Am I missing the point?  Perhaps.  I suppose it is true that anybody who takes personal computing seriously is running Firefox and Thunderbird and Google Desktop on Windows.  In that sense, yeah Windows is dead.  Personally, I use Macs, so I am well insulated from Microsoft.  However, they are alive and well if only because of the Office suite.  If I send a an OpenDocument file to ten of my friends, they won't be able to open it.  If I send a Word file, everybody can open it.  The point is, Microsoft is still quite relevant today.  Although, I can see your points and would fully agree that free Linux could easily supplant Windows as a desktop environment (to run your stated Web 2.0 apps) or Macs.  I applaud your essay; you take some interesting positions and provide some profound insight.  Very interesting.  Brad Engelmann.\n",1175913919

There is no question of NEXT one unless we get this one up and running successfully.May be we may need to modify or add more things but if that is called NEXT thing then we will take it ;-)  ",1175913675

We worked three straight days at the end that we'd have spread out otherwise. I imagine YCombinator often jumpstarts even the companies it doesn't fund. That would be interesting to see numbers on. How many companies YCombinator has played a role in helping indirectly. We've certainly been inspired by this process.",1175913361
9847,comment,9770,9840,0,0,erdos2,,,"I recently acquired a Mac Book Pro. There was precisely one Windows program I wanted to run on it (SuperMemo) under Parallels, which received good reviews. Rather than wait to purchase a copy of Windows from the local CompUSA, I used an OEM copy of Windows from a defenestrated a DELL box (I replaced Windows with Debian). After installing XP as a guest OS under Parallels, I activated XP online by purchasing a product key through the Genuine Advantage program. <p>But that wasn't good enough for Microsoft. Microsoft informed me in their emailed order acknowledgment that I was some kind of felon: ""To convert your counterfeit Windows XP software to a genuine copy of Windows XP using the new Product Key, you will need to download and run the Windows Product Key Update Tool on the same computer you used to purchase the electronic license for Windows XP."" <p>The following week I received in the mail a Windows Genuine Advantage Kit for Windows XP Professional; it contained a letter asserting that I had ""submitted a counterfeit report"" with my order, and that this report would be ""treated as confidential."" Moreover, ""...Microsoft's anti-piracy team investigates each and every lead we receive. Since investigations are ongoing and extremely confidential, we are unable to provide you with the status of the particular lead you have submitted. The length of time to bring about enforcements varies depending on the nature of a particular investigation."" <p>Hateful monsters! Frightful miscreants! I suppose I deserve this for having anything to do with Windows. ",1175913342

9845,comment,9711,9711,0,0,Leonidas,,,"My next invention would entail reducing medication errors. Current available applications are developed by hackers who make it too difficult for non-hacker healthcare professionals to understand how to use.  In addition, the logical layout of lab values, prescriptions and so forth is not optimized for decreased error.  To have hospitals pay 40-60 million a year to license an ineffective, flawed, application is ridiculous.  I've been in one of the most advanced hospitals in the United States and my gawd, they still use a ""DOS"" system like interface ...wth...60 million a year for that?  <p>Personally, my error medication invention will be a contribution I'd like to make to patients and to my profession.  You don't get second chances when you deal with patients.. a first error can kill.\n",1175912569
9844,comment,9786,9832,0,0,me_jobs_r_u_woz,,,"Mukund and Leonidas, I have a reasonable understanding of programming; I designed and helped build a significant part of the code.  I did not mean to appear as if I have no knowledge of, or desire to, learn code.  But the opportunity I am talking about is to complete the transformation of the current app at hyper speed, so that we can fill the need right now, not in 12 months or longer.  Surely, if the demand is as great as I am saying, someone will fill the gap very soon.",1175912386

Of course now that Vista has failed to garner any real attention, this view is confirmed.<p>Further, I think that even on the desktop things are going to change and fast.<p>I don't think people realize just how well Apple is doing.<p>Their Mac sales are up something like %50, but they havent' really experienced network effects yet... as MS fails to come up with anything inspiring, PC owners are going to try switching in larger and larger numbers.<p>We aren't yet seeing the watershet that this is yet-- but the Mac has moved from the margins to a viable maisntream possibility.... and as PCs bought between 2004-2006 come up for replacement, a huge number of those machines will be replaced with Macs. <p>It was only in 2006 that people outside the software and web industry really started to see the Mac as a viable alternative.<p><p>Personally, I am starting to feel a bit odd, since suddenly there are all these new Mac users.  <p>When the Mac becomes mainstream, I'll lose the comfortable non-conformity I've enjoyed since 1988.",1175911978

9840,comment,9770,9770,0,0,BobG,,,"Being nearly 50years old, what frightens me about MS is that they think they can sell an OS which they can remotely turn off without out a court warrant and then its up to you if your business hasn't gone bankrupt to sue them . This just shows complete and utter contempt for their customers.Which will do for them in the long run.My next box will be linux. Maybe the apple setup etc looks attractive to the younger generation but its only superficial. They have their own history of arrogant greed too. Bob G\n",1175911668
