9668,comment,9625,9658,0,0,bls,,,"How do you explain the fact that the pencils I buy today are a lot more sophisticated, more comfortable, and have more features (refillable lead, advancing the lead via shaking) than the pencils I bought 10 years ago? The cost of a simple pencil is like $0.05. The pencils I buy are almost $10.00 each + lead + erasers. I like the $10.00 pencil guys' business plan a lot more than the $0.05 pencil guys' plan.",1175885258

9663,comment,9646,9646,0,0,neilc,,,"Off the top of my head, I'd think that the UI would be of secondary importance in any startup that is writing systems software: if you can solve an important business problem, a fancy demo is impressive (and important!), but the basic problem you're solving often doesn't require a UI. For example, enterprise data integration (conversion between data stored in heterogeneous formats and systems), or natural language translation/processing. Many startups in information management / data warehousing: if you build a Teradata killer, the UI is certainly a component of your product, but it is pretty secondary. A startup building hardware (say, networking stuff) might not need to pay much attention to the UI, depending on the target market. etc.<p>If by ""startup"" you just mean ""implementing the Web 2.0 idea-of-the-week"", then yeah, I agree UI is usually pretty important.",1175883966

My coworker and I have been talking about branching out and learning completely different languages to stay fresh and learn some different views. <p>It took me 3 read throughs of this article to begin to get a sense of what makes people rave about LISP. I've also read Chapter 2 of PG's book. From what I can see, I like.<p>I'm not saying I'm a convert (yet!) but I absolutely plan on reading Paul's book and working through the examples and excercises there. <p>In the meantime, is the article a good way to think about Lisp?

9658,comment,9625,9640,0,0,e1ven,,,"That's a great example, and illustrates exactly why I disagree with you ;)<p>If you design things to be simple and expandable, you don't NEED to keep adding features in order to give the functionality people have.<p>A Pencil has a certain set of features. It can write, it can erase. <p>It has other things it can do because of its design- It can act as a piece of wood, so it can be used to push things on the table, or used as Lincoln Logs..  But they don't need to ADD anything to support these uses.<p>You can decide tomorrow to use a pencil for things the developers never thought of- You can use it to trace leads, or use it to build a fort. You can use it to hold two things apart from one another, or use the eraser to hold pins..<p>These aren't features that needed to be added. No adjustments to the pencil are necessary to support fort-building. They're new and clever ways of using what's already there.<p>THAT's what you want to encourage. Find ways to create services that can be used in ways you never imagined.<p>APIs are a great example of that, but there's more that can be done. Make thing simple. Let people add their own uses for things and they'll do amazing things.<p>
