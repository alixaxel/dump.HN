13772,comment,13742,13759,0,0,dpapathanasiou,,,"Ok, strictly speaking, SoC is not free.<p>But SoC stipends are tiny, <i>almost</i> free.<p>Also, remember that Google vets each proposal, so they're funding those projects they'll be able to leverage in code, people (SoC is a great recruiting tool), or both.<p>The result of SoC is not so different from what you've suggested.",1176843586

You may also consider how e-mail and calendar use cases are tied closely together.<p>I'm not sold on how Google can leverage their offerings (aside from better image searching) to make as strong of a case in presentation software as they did with online calendars.",1176843505

Would you be likely to scale it back, or to continue funding companies and hope that some of them could ride out the storm for however many years it takes?",1176842309

13758,comment,13720,13733,0,0,veritas,,,"Good point, but as long as Google provides the essentials for creating online presentations, it will win easily.  Just ask someone out on the street who they'd trust more to do a good job with their presentations: Google or Zenter?  My money is that the majority (by a large amount) will say Google simply because of the name.  In reality, everyone on YCNews and TechCrunch are startup obsessed, tech obsessed early adopters.  We have no problem choosing Zenter over Google if Zenter is a good product.  Normal people, however, will, more often than not, gravitate towards Google.  ",1176842096

13755,comment,13650,13693,0,0,cyu,,,"You shouldn't blindly implement features just because your users are telling you to do so.  While it is important to listen and react to your user's concerns, it's also your responsibility to maintain the integrity/consistency of the application.  Also, if you don't believe that the feature you're building is going to have any effect, then it's already heading towards failure because you're not going to be committed to its success.<p>I agree with jkush -- if you don't agree with the user, you should engage the user and see if you can get the feature to a common ground that you can agree with.<p>Also, if your feedback loop is just an email, maybe you should add a forum to make the loop more interactive.",1176841887

You can find good XML processing tools for whatever language/platform you want.  High quality SGML processing tools are much less common.  I'm willing to take the overhead associated with doing an XHTML to HTML 4.01 conversion as the last step of the process in order to be able to use clean, high-quality, reliable tools for the harder parts.",1176841071
