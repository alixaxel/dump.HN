I read it cover to cover in a day, and then read a couple of his previous books.<p>However, when reading his earlier books I noticed that a lot of the ideas had been picked up by other bloggers, e.g. Seth Godin. Because of this, the book didn't seem nearly as insightful as it would have if I read it when it was published.<p>I suspect the same would be true today for AotS because of all the VC bloggers. While many VCs did have blogs two years ago, most of them weren't giving that kind of practical advice at the time. Paul Kedrosky and Fred Wilson had yet to publish many of their best columns, and Venture Hacks and Presentation Zen didn't even exist. Not to mention that PG had only published the first two or three of his essays on startups, the ones in Hackers and Painters (not counting the essays on lisp/coding).",1183779673

I have seen this on several sites (even some large ones), but that doesn't change the fact that it's a bit bothersome.  I just wanted to let you know in case you weren't aware of the issue.",1183778750

Most startups can't plan their launch so precisely so far in advance.<p>You should launch as soon as you're ready, and no sooner.  Usually you don't know when that will be till a few days before.",1183778589

I felt the same way after reading Guy's book.<p>I do not deny that the book sells well, all I'm saying is that for the serious (aspiring) entrepreneur, it's not worth the money or the time.",1183778039

32886,comment,32827,32874,0,0,myoung8,,,"The trouble with getting VCs to advertise is that their preferred way to generate deal flow is through trusted relationships. It would be difficult to do this purely through advertising (and it costs them less to just use word of mouth, not that they are tight on the money these days...).<p>Getting startups to advertise isn't very logical either because most of the time the target audience isn't the so-called TechCrunch 50K (unless they are advertising a job opening, but again, this is more often that not fulfilled through word of mouth and personal recommendations).<p>This is an unfortunate reality of the way the world works (although arguably word of mouth is a lot more effective in some cases).<p>Honestly, I think you're best chance at monetization is advertising for companies that provide the proverbial ""picks and shovels"" to startups--cut a deal with a hosting company, a domain registrar, The Company Corporation (to register as an LLC or C/S-Corp). Perhaps you'd have better luck getting some lawyers that deal with this stuff to advertise on there. (Think about this: you know who all the big VCs are, but do you know any good lawyers?) There are few other types of services that fall into this category. It would be neat to let people rate their experiences with different service providers.",1183777697
