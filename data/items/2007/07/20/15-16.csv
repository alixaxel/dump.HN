Good solid brainstorming is useful, but not when I'm actually coding. For that I like to be in my own world with the headphones on. <p>Sounds like TechStars is more like an incubator setup in this regard.",1184947117

I had never done anything with PHP before, but knowing enough c programming that was still done below an hour (finding the right place to modify was the only hard part).<p>I think the point is not which modification I made - nothing that was much different from some other usual spam-prevention mods which are in use. The trick is that no spammer cares about a single site enough to work around a custom solution.",1184946117

35635,comment,35015,35621,0,0,palish,,,"That's exactly the problem, a reward in the face of repugnant behavior.  I wasn't going to respond, but I found this comment pretty depressing so I have to ask you:  You seriously believe being rich is a license to be a douche?  Or that everyone's allowed to act however they want to food service workers, or the people that guard you while you sleep?  Or anyone at all?  What if, for example, someone had to be a waitress to save up money for college?  Sure, she could start a business, but what if she has literally zero money and no contacts, and she was just born like that? <p>What's depressing is how often people don't think of other people.",1184945681
35634,comment,35542,35625,0,0,willarson,,,"Solving that test is indeed pretty simple, I think its O(n^2) give or take. Even if it was n^3 the value of n is so low it isn't restrictive. The benefit is that it is relatively uncommon (not being targeted), and it is more difficult than the average captcha (less likely to be targeted). It is also resistant to brute force (many captchas have the answer to them included in the question, this one requires some parsing and solving, not simply trying words near the captcha randomly). This captcha is not perfect, but I think it is better than most current captchas, and it is deliver neutral (doesn't penalize the impaired). Thus it seems like a step in the right direction, but is not a final destination by any means.<p>\nBy non-consistent UI I mean breaking the ""Name, Email, Webpage, Body"" paradigm. I think a good (although certainly harder to implement) example of this is <a href=""http://www.djangobook.com/en/beta/chapter01/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.djangobook.com/en/beta/chapter01/</a> . If you click on the little tabs/indexes on the side of the page a little comment box pops up that is relevant to the specific position. This UI is sufficiently different from a standard commenting system that a standard form filling spambot would be clueless. This is only an example, but perhaps it helps explain my idea of diversifying a bit. Other types of spam bots would not be affected, but perhaps similar changes would make them less effective as well (your example of using Ajax is a good possible example).",1184945597

Lots more of them could, but not inside a huge bureaucratic company.<p>Holding 90% of the best engineers in the world ""hostage"" with six figure salaries and great perks is a good way to slow them down. I think they're scared of being blindsided, since that's what they did to Yahoo & co.<p>Google should be more brave and set them free. They can easily  stay the best at snapping up early-stage startups. They already do this, but it should be their only strategy. Google should almost completely stop hiring direct.<p>I guess this is really just ""Hiring is Obsolete"" from a slightly different perspective. That it might be evil of Google to jealously ""horde"" hackers out of fear.\n",1184945498

Germany is now lengthening retirement age, raising taxes, lowering benefits, etc to try not to go under.  And the high unemployment is really a big deal - it is giving rise to a growing rightest (ie neo-nazi) movement in Germany, and I think to Islamic extremists in France, etc.",1184945477

35616,comment,35015,35257,0,0,Anonymous314,,,"I think I was unnecessarily unclear - let's say we're talking about buying eggs.  Suppose I'm willing to pay up to $3 for a dozen.  That doesn't mean that I should buy them if I find eggs for $2.99 - I should keep shopping around, because grocers can profitably sell eggs for $2 a dozen, so I'm bound to find eggs closer to the $2 mark.  I need to take into account what would be reasonable for the other party when deciding if a deal is reasonable, not just the limits of what would be reasonable for me.  If I'm stuck, and <i>everyone</i> is selling eggs for $3 a dozen, then it matters whether that's beyond my personal threshold or not. If I <i>only</i> note how close a deal is to my personal threshold, without noting whether the other party would be likely to agree to a more favorable deal, I'm liable to get ripped off, unless I have no leverage for negotiating anyway, and I can only take it or leave it.",1184943654

There are maybe 3 or 4 companies that matter in defense, each making many billions while others get an order of magnitude less. So, no...there is no funding competitors in defense. There isn't much competition to speak of.<p>But this is not to say the machines Boeing makes are not amazing.<p>My comments are from working on military contracts. They're enough to make a reasonable person run for the hills.",1184943632
