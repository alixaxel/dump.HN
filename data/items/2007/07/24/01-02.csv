Why would we take what is largely an automated process (extracting information from a site to guide ads), and make humans do it?<p>With the idea to ""make something people want"", isn't it a bad idea to make something a minority want and the vast majority will fight against? Especially considering the majority's clicks are all that matter.",1185240390

And by sell I am referring to the ability to convert an anonymous website visitor who is visiting a new website for the first time, into a qualified lead and then a paying customer.<p>Users frequenting Digg and CNet are in a completely different mindset, than someone looking to get a mortgage quote, or a user who is surfing the net looking for a new bookshelf.<p>For these type of websites, promoting a specific product/service, it's been shown you typically have 4 seconds to convince the user to stick around, before they hit the BACK button.<p>Our research conversion data shows users were more comfortable with buying when presented with a thin website.<p>If you examine popular retail sites targeting the average Internet user, you'll find they all follow a similar paradigm:  Overstock.com,  Target.com, BuyOwner.com, WalMart.com etc. - are all designed as ""thin"" sites, deliberately not utilizing the entire width of the page.",1185239289
