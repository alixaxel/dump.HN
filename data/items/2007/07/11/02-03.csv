I'm not sure it can actually help the Wozniaks of the world be more like Jobs.<p>One of my brothers was raised in a different part of the country by my father's first wife. My other brother was raised by my father. My brothers and father have something very obvious in common to anyone who meets them. They can effortlessly and genuinely connect with strangers and make them feel at total ease. They've all worked in sales at some point and were remarkably good at it. I'm fairly certain the main trait they share is their deep empathetic dispositions.<p>This had lead me to believe there's a huge genetic component in being great at sales. I'm pretty skeptical it can be taught effectively, anymore than you can teach someone to be a funny person.<p>BTW, I think Freakonomics is a great book about incentives and a definite must-read for any startup founder.\n",1184122667

33590,comment,32362,32362,0,0,jmtame,,,"I added a footnote to this article, because I think some people have become misguided by the purpose of the article.<p>I'll include it for reference:<p>Important note: In an earlier version, I made reference to a venture firm, and I think some people were under the impression that the venture firm was at fault.  On the contrary, the venture firm I was at in this startup was extremely helpful, hospitable, and encouraging, as were all investors involved in the project.  I didnt create this article as a way to point fingers at anyone, and if you take anything away from this, please just see it as helpful advice given freely.",1184122081

33586,comment,33543,33543,0,0,mynameishere,,,"People like Craig always seem (<i>seem</i>, since I don't have a wormhole into his brain) to have this moralistic I-am-not-for-profit attitude. Does it ever occur to his, seriously, that every single entity posting on his site is ravenously trying to make the greatest/easiest/cheapest possible buck? ...and that he is facilitating that immoral attitude?",1184120494
33585,comment,33558,33579,0,0,palish,,,"The dinners mostly.  I'm mainly asking about equality.. My current employment's management has a bad habit of looking down on the implementors.  It seems like if employees are segregated in YC companies (<i>These</i> guys are eligible to attend, but <i>they</i> are not) then it would naturally lead to some problems.<p>Any startup I work with will get my deepest trust and hardest work.  My life will revolve around the company succeeding.  So - sorry if I sound a bit.. um.. arrogant - I expect nothing less than complete trust and equality in return.<p>I'm totally bored with life in the midwest.  Where I work there are about ten programmers. We all work on this long row of tables stacked end-to-end, in one room - no walls between us.  Everyone's talking and yelling all the time.  It's so noisy that I can hardly focus at any given time.  One of them has this great habit of yelling ""FUCK!"" at least once a day when something he's doing doesn't work out.  And he yells <i>really</i> loudly.<p>So I need a change and I'm ready to devote myself to something brilliant, not to churn out mediocre crap day after day, working on a product that crashes every other day.  But I couldn't totally devote myself if I wasn't trusted and equal.. could you?<p>Sorry that this turned into a personal account.. I just needed to vent and hope that maybe somewhere, finally, a company can treat its employees as equals to the management.",1184120347
33584,story,,,1,1,staunch,"Do Pragmatic Tools For Learning to Speak a New Language Exist Already?",,"I'm studying Japanese and have started hacking up various tools to assist. I'm seriously considering turning my stuff into a more polished project and releasing it, but not if someone has done something great already. I am concentrating on very pragmatic conversational speaking and not anything remotely academic. I really like image-association and vocabulary-building tools. Anyone know of some super smart (web-based?) tools for this that support Japanese?<p>",1184120260

My clients with an existing code base run whatever they are currently running.<p>I don't have an opinion on the use of multiple programming languages, the purpose of a database is to reliably <i>store</i> data that (usually) some other programming language uses or produces.
