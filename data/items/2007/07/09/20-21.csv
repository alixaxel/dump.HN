33328,comment,33312,33320,0,0,pg,,,"The seas around Venice are all shoals with just a few approaches.  And the air is pretty hazy.  I think small boats would bring news of approaching ships before anyone could see them from St Mark's.<p>Apparently Galileo did demonstrate his telescope from the top of St Mark's, showing some Venetian senators that with it they could see the sails of distant ships.  For that information to be valuable, though, it would have to be the first news to be had of them, and that seems unlikely.",1184012729

Cant believe that they[cnn/Time] are still using the same old buggy lame system they implemented for finding the ""Influential People list"" [<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27475"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27475</a> ] It was an easily hackable one and it still is. Weebly is #1 on the list now, and once again [honestly, i am embarrassed to say this ], i am responsible :(<p>For the ""influential people list"", what pg said became true [""Even if it wasn't hackable, it would still produce garbage results"" ]. The final list had nothing to do with the ""democratically"" voted list(hacked list). <p>The developers who worked on this particular voting system  should be ashamed of themselves. They should have implemented atleast a basic IP check.",1184012580

Unfortunately it reports ""Invalid Operator"" error when I try to use that bookmark now.<p>We're looking to hook up a credit card processing to our app. As cheaply and secure as possible :) We're running a subscription-based service therefore a solid recurring billing is a must-have.<p>Suggestions?

Supposedly he'd stand in the St. Mark's Sq. Bell Tower watching for foreign ships, and then use this information to arbitrage commodities.",1184011708
