1320199,comment,1318916,1319893,0,0,trominos,,,"Even assuming that this ""screwed factor"" is something meaningful, you miscalculated it. I think you're trying to find (percentage increase in work over normal hours/percentage increase in pay over normal pay).<p>If your pay is just a percentage of a company's profits, the amount of equity you hold has no impact on this number. If you working 50% more hours generates 10% more profits (or whatever) for the company, you get 10% more pay for 50% more work, so the screwed factor is 5.<p>Again, this is assuming that the screwed factor is meaningful in the context of a startup, and it isn't. First of all, the different possible outcomes for an early employee of a small startup can mostly be boiled down to two, maybe three: the startup IPOs and you get rich, it gets sold and you get well-compensated, it fails and you get nothing. Treating your income as a very smooth function of the hours you work is misguided in this kind of scenario.<p>Second, contributing to a culture of working really hard on the startup (by working overtime) might be more important than the work you actually do in your overtime. Startup employees don't work in a vacuum.",1273028362

1320191,comment,1319054,1319978,0,0,btilly,,,"The Netherlands examples are interesting.<p>In the piece I quoted, it isn't that value scales like n<i>n then like n log(n).  The argument is that value scales like n log(n), which for small n looks more like n</i>n than it does for large n.  That said the argument given implicitly assumes that most of the people in the network have most of the people they really care about in the network as well.  This assumption is less likely to be true for small networks than large ones.<p>It didn't make it into the paper, but an interesting optical illusion was discussed while we were writing it.  Most of us judge the ubiquity of a network according to how many people we personally know who use it.  Therefore people's value from belonging to a network tends to scale linearly with the size they perceive that network as having.  (A typical American neither perceives nor values the growth of that network in China.)  Which means that each individual observes what Bob Metcalfe did when he came up with his rule of thumb.  We found that interesting, but left it out of the paper.<p>Another discussion we had was on different networks that scale differently.  The two extremes we came up with are the telegraph networks and eBay.  In the case of the telegraph network there is an asymmetry between senders and receivers.  It is easy to make every resident of a major US city a potential receiver, at which point the network value scales linearly with the number of senders.  And at the opposite end, auctions scale in a less approximately linear fashion.  However we decided against including that because we didn't have detailed enough data to support our preliminary conclusions.<p>Also you should note that the IEE Spectrum article is an abridged form of <a href=""http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/metcalfe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dtc.umn.edu/~odlyzko/doc/metcalfe.pdf</a>.  The full version offers several different lines of reasoning that all converge on n log(n) scaling rules.",1273028033

I'm guessing that you think they aren't good for ""fishing"" either?<p>The basic idea with StackOverFlow is to ask well-defined questions and get well-defined answers, without the long messy threaded response found in most forums.  The worst is when the thread ends in a dead end.<p>The wiki feature and the ability to include formated code are very useful.  The reputation economy is essential, so more questions get answered, including older ones.  What happens in a forum when no one answers a question?  Ask again a few days later?<p>Also, they do have short discussions through comments, which I have found to be effective.<p>Finally, I think you, and many others, are completely missing the point of StackOverFlow, and hopefully other future sites like it.  If say, for example, 100,000 people are learning [Lisp, Scala, Java, C++, Go,  jQuery, C#, etc], they are going to have the a lot of similar questions that really only need to be asked once, with one or two solutions provided.  Now the next 99,999 people don't need to ask the same question.  So, now we have taken the FAQ and improved upon it by creating it dynamically through voting, and question matching.<p>There are various improvements that could be done to StackOverFlow. They are essentially creating a huge database of programming knowledge.  Ideally it, or a similar project, could be organized to enable someone to start learning any new topic and become proficient by browsing and searching the site.  Questions could be further categorized to enable better filtering (eg. Mac OS bug, compiler warning message, compiler error message), include specific version solutions (eg. Java 1.5, Java 1.6).  A Rosetta Stone feature could be added linking solutions.  For example, the question: ""How do I reverse a string in [Java]?"" could provide links to the Perl, C#, Java, Lisp, Scheme, Javascript solutions.",1273025673
