While what you mention is indeed a factor, I think the greatest factor is the fact that on the internet, ROI can be calculated. The metrics are much more precise and I have a feeling that there's been a <i>LOT</i> more money spent on advertising than was ever justified.<p>I think this is just the effects of greater transparency on the client side. When the client can measure effectiveness, advertising prices plummet. I think the current dismal advertising revenue on the internet is actually what advertising revenue should've been all along.",1275278340

What happened to ""Right, just the <i>other</i> guys should be regulated?""<p>I'm not sure what's not clear about the notion that large risk should be regulated.  If a company is capable, due to size or what have you, of harming a large number of people due to malice or incompetence on the part of its corporate governance, then sanity demands it should be regulated.<p>However, small companies should be regulated as little as possible.  I mean, assuming you want a working economy.  I'm not sure you do - actually, I'm not sure <i>what</i> you want, but from the standpoint of pattern recognition of your strawman attacks, I'd assume you want to regulate <i>all</i> business as little as possible.<p>Where I suspect we differ is the degree of ""possible"".<p>In my opinion, any business that can destroy hundreds of miles of coastline for other people while still having a banner profit year?  Yeah, that should probably be regulated, since the Invisible Hand ain't gonna do it.  Look up the Tragedy of the Commons sometime; you might find it instructive.  (Or perhaps not.

They are scared.<p>For every great advertising campaign that ends up all over twitter/facebook/etc, there are 10 that bring consumer complaints, shame, and a negative image. People are scared to try new things because their client might get mad and fire them.<p>To understand why this mentality exists, you need to get the 'media landscape.'<p>The Client - Whoever is paying for the advertising. This could be Pepsi, Coke, or Trojan. Generally the actual person is a high-powered marketing exec with a VP+ title.<p>The Media Agency - A middle-man group that manages the 'campaign' on behalf of the client. They recruit the different groups involved, pay them a bit, and run all the numbers for the client. In the end, they are judged on 1-2 'metrics' that the client cares about. This could be 'Performance' (# of ads clicked vs. ads viewed), 'Engagement' (# of times people click the play button in a video player, for example), or 'Share of Voice' (percentage of a website's views in a given time period that the brand owns).<p>The Media Agency boss is generally a 40-something advertising hotshot. He is hands off on nearly everything once his company signs an exclusive deal with the brand.<p>The Media Agency worker is generally a 20-23 year old who couldn't decide on a major in college so they went with 'international business.' They don't really use the internet much and are judged solely on the metrics mentioned above.<p>In the end, advertising deals are closed based on:
-Buying the agency a stripper or tickets to a hockey game
-Being friends with someone at the agency
-Being a website that someone at the agency visits every day<p>I can go into a ton more detail on things like the ridiculous 'RFP Process,' Creative Agencies, and other stupid advertising things if the interest is there.<p>p.s.

1391718,comment,1386670,1391242,0,0,Vivtek,,,"To be more general, then: <i>nobody</i> really gets the reality of other countries until they've left theirs - but since America makes most of the world's blockbuster movies, everybody has an ""America of the mind"" that is an internally consistent model.  I hasten to add that Americans have the same model - even though we live here and see reality all the time.<p>Europeans and the Japanese, for instance, think that society naturally agrees that education is a good thing.  After all, educated people have created everything worthwhile in life, right?  Doctors are educated, government administrators are educated, engineers are educated - stands to reason!  Americans, on average, mistrust educated people, to such an extent that education can actually be a liability for anyone proposing public policy.<p>And yet this is not reflected in movies, where scientists or engineers may be goofy, but they're always respected.  So the America of the mind is profoundly out of synch with real America, in ways that flummox anyone who tries to live here in the blithe assumption that America is a first-world nation.<p>That's just one example off the top of my head.

1391697,comment,1390440,1391319,0,0,strlen,,,"> As for your sequencing recommendation, I think it's better to learn foundational CS with something like SICP/6.001 and then reifying it with C (this CMU course looks damned good: <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/index.html</a>). I think it's easier to make your mental tool box bigger if you can do it this way.<p>Thanks for pointing out SICP/learning a non-imperative language. It's very important to learn a functional programming language and Scheme is the best choice because a) it's the language SICP (one of the best computer science books) uses b) it's ""pure-enough"" (you still have set! if you need it, but tail call elimination is a part of the language specification) as a functional language and doesn't introduce too many other (important, but unrelated) ideas (unlike Haskell or ML which have strict typing and unlike Scala or F# which have OO).<p>I would, however, disagree with you that it should be the first language: it should be taught before ""blub damage"" takes place (e.g., before students think only in terms of OO) but it's good to be familiar with programming and data structure to some extent (it helps to understand cons cells as pairs of pointers). C is a great language to <i>precede Scheme</i>: it doesn't force the OO paradigm and teaches students to differentiate between the value of the object and the address of the object (thinking in terms of multiple levels of indirection).<p>The reason I argue <i>against</i> teaching SICP to complete newbies is because otherwise students tend to think of functional programming as some sort of an academic exercise and not as an approach to solve the problem. I am basing this on actual observations of students that I know at UC Berkeley and at my own school (where a Haskell based course served the same role). Unfortunately in general I find that students don't appreciate the value they get out of a non-""Blub school"" (""why am I messing with pointers and recursion instead of writing GUI apps"") until much later in their career (""oh, I know how to reduce the state to take advantage of all the cores!"").<p>(1) I use ""Blub school"" rather than Spolsky's ""Java school"", as teaching C#, Python or Ruby as <i>sole</i> languages would have the same effect (it's trivial to learn all of these languages once you already know C and Scheme, it's an uphill battle do the reverse).",1275275856

The Author even says places like MIT teach you more theory and mathematical aspects of CS.

Microsoft basically finally made a nice portable media player just after the point where growth stopped in portable media players.<p>Courier I find interesting. I was one of the people who thought the demo looked really interesting. It totally spoke to me as a device that if it operated the way it did in the video (which is a big if), I'd have had a real use for. But I don't know if that means it would have actually been successful as a product. I think if Microsoft thought they could build it, and that it would be successful, they'd have done so. The fact that they scrapped it (or did whatever it is you do with a product concept video that you never actually said was going to be a product) shows me that they don't understand that market, or don't think it exists sufficiently.<p>I think part of the problem is the way Microsoft Research is structured.  According to Bill Buxton (who is kind of my dream ""wish he was my uncle""), Microsoft Research is basically tasked with incubating long-term technologies.<p>In this video, he talks about how some of the stuff he's been working on over the past decade is now starting to get used in shipping projects: <a href=""http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/LarryLarsen/CES-2010-NUI-with-Bill-Buxton/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/LarryLarsen/CES-2010-NUI-with...</a><p>While I think that's awesome for Microsoft to be that forward-looking, I think they also need a more short-term skunkworks.<p>Maybe not as radical as Google's ""20% time"", but I think something that shortens the amount of time between ""concept and prototype"".<p>Windows Phone 7 seems like a pretty good idea. It's a fairly novel approach to interface design; but it didn't just spring up. Microsoft basically plodded through ten years of bad mobile strategy and pissed away their technology lead until even they couldn't pretend that they were headed in the right direction.<p>If you contrast that with Palm, who also developed and launched a completely new platform in a relatively short period of time, I think it's obvious that Microsoft works in glacial time.  Then again, Palm's gamble hasn't really paid off either.<p>I think Microsoft couldn't possibly bet too big on mobile. I know it's trendy, and I'm certainly not being profound, but I don't think it's ludicrous to consider it the largest growth market in computing for the next decade. I think the problem (which the original article points out, is that Google has pretty much screwed their existing business model by giving away Android).",1275274985
