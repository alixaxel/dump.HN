I wanted open source to be fairly common and well-accepted, and not just something that weird people wrote and talked about on Slashdot. And hacker-friendly open-source Linux-based smartphones would be great, but that was just too implausibly awesome to even hope for. I wanted pleasant languages like Python to get serious commercial use.<p>Now, all those things have happened or are happening. Want to get on board with cloud hosting in any way? The standard options involve Linux VM images. Languages like Ruby and Python are mainstream and well-supported. Android is disrupting the smartphone market, and has the kind of widespread commercial backing I never would have thought possible for an open, Linux-based thing. Microsoft is no longer an unstoppable leviathan; they've stopped being scary.<p>Occasionally I'll reflect on all this and chortle happily.

Unlike HTML, there's only one correct rendering of a video, and the problem is pretty much solved by the first solid portable free decoder. Optimal encoding is an active research topic, but that can rely on whatever the de facto decoder supports.",1274551734
