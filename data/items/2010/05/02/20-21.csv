As an open platform users can and will install Flash. Might as well bundle a stable version with the OS so users don't have to install it themselves. Good for end user experience.<p>Flash on mobile/touch: Not an industry standard. In fact it doesn't really <i>exist</i> yet other than Flash Lite or Nokia's custom version of Flash for the N900. There is an opportunity to move away form Flash here in favor of HTML5 on the web. For native apps obviously Apple would prefer people to use their proprietary platform instead of Adobe's proprietary platform. As a closed platform, and a popular one, Apple has leverage to prevent Flash from becoming a mobile industry standard.",1272833847

If you don't believe me, check the Firefox crash analysis for today: <a href=""http://people.mozilla.com/crash_analysis/20100502/20100502_Firefox_3.5.9-core-counts.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.mozilla.com/crash_analysis/20100502/20100502_F...</a>. The Flash plugin is the greatest cause of crashes for them on the Mac, and it's pretty damn high on Windows as well.<p>The claim by the Adobe CEO that Mac flash crashes are ""to do with the Apple operating system"" is complete and total nonsense (there's nothing in OS X that would cause Flash to be crashy, and the data supports the fact that it's bad on Windows as well).",1272832118
