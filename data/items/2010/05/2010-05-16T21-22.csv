I mean, look at the top four: Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, and Fairy Tail. They all use much the same formula, but with the details changed. (Naruto has ninjas, One Piece has pirates, Bleach has something else, and Fairy Tail has mages.) It gets tiresome after a while, but that kind of thing tops the charts, consistently.<p>Meanwhile you have absolutely beautiful manga like Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou (which is made from liquid happiness) that don't even get licensed for official English translation.",1274047025

1352872,comment,1313791,1351383,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"> As far as I know there is no other language with as comprehensive a collection of <i>container-independent</i> algorithms in the standard library<p>Whoops. I forgot that, sorry. People may have meant true generic programming, after all. Now, actually using STL's <algorithm> and still end up with readable code isn't easy to me. For instance, each time `for_each` or `accumulate` would be appropriate, I end up writing a `for` loop instead, because the end result is more concise and  more local. So in the end, container independent algorithms rarely matter to me.<p>> I can write a simple, templated, singly-linked list class in C++ which can do everything the same `'a list` in ML can do.<p>I think we don't use ""simple"" in the same way. Here, such an implementation of lists takes only 12 tokens and 2 lines in ML. How many do you need to do the same in C++? My first guess is more five times that, probably ten. Still simple, but much more complicated nonetheless.<p>Though in that particular case, I'd rather blame the absence of inductive types. Templates really are simple here. The real problem shows when you combine them with inheritance: you have to jump through some hoops (like having to re-declare virtual methods in the derived classes).<p>> Your following two paragraphs are a fairly obvious attempt to change your original, wrong statement into something defensible.<p>It was an attempt to clarify my meaning. Yes, my statement was wrong. Lambda lifting doesn't go <i>way</i> beyond syntactic sugar. But, to me, it still crosses the line. To you, it doesn't. I think that's only because your definition of ""syntactic sugar"" is more liberal than mine.<p>But even then, we're not done. Before you do the actual lambda lifting, you have to parse the source code. Trivial in Lisp, but quite a feat in C++.<p>> […] The <i>only</i> difference is that now programmers must give a name to all their functions.<p>To me, such a restriction is sufficient to make function second-class citizen. If you can have anonymous integers, and you can't have anonymous functions at the same time, then functions are not first class. Again, we disagree on a mere definition. Beyond that, I agree that the other ""first-classiness"" properties of functions are far more important.",1274046329

In truth your CV should really be considered a framework, that you customize to each application based on the job ad.<p>A CV is a sales document, you mustn't lie on it, but its purpose isn't to be a completely objective file on you.

At your level, even 1 page is enough. And be careful with ""experience"" because it doesn't mean what you think it means.
