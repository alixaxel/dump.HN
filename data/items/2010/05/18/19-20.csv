1358828,comment,1357592,1358410,0,0,Kaizyn,,,"The main issue it has is that the management tools are a hack. They (Atlassian) started with a very simple system built around their relational database schema. As more users adopted the system, there was increased demand for a number of additional features to be added in. These have all been tacked in and the fact that they are all an afterthought really shows through in how you setup and manage JIRA projects.<p>From an end user point of view, JIRA is bad because it is slow, has a bad user interface, and really doesn't quite fit most workflows. If you're trying to track a trouble ticket, which is what JIRA was originally designed for, then it will perform the job adequately. However, anything else forces you to fight more against the system design to get things just the way your work process needs to be.",1274212779

I am feeling vulnerable right now, and had to reach out to the community for a little support.<p>I have been consulting for the last few months. That one client was my largest client and they are going away very shortly. I could either continue trying to do the freelance/consulting thing, or get a 'regular job' except I am in Jamaica and the startup scene, that I would want to work in, is not available locally. Going through the visa process is such a turn off, for another job in the US.<p>On that note, I would rather work on my app and am going to put my idea out there and see what happens.<p>I have been working with designers and developers for the better part of the last 3 - 4 years, in a project management type capacity and have discovered a huge pain point that I am determined to fix.<p>When a designer does a comp for me, they email it to me (or post it to basecamp, or upload to an ftp). I then look at it, reply to the email with comments, or post a comment to basecamp or send notes in a word/txt file. They then revise it, and on and on and on. This process gets very messy, especially when I have to then pass the comp along to other stakeholders (e.g. people on the executive team, other designers, developers, etc.). So I am building a web app to do that. It's called either 'Comp Version' or 'Comp Versions'. I own both domains.<p>I have started working on the interface, mainly jQuery, HTML, CSS. I am no designer, but I know how it should look and function and have decided to just build it myself. The truth is, that had things continued on (i.e. still had my major client) I was planning on taking the long slog of a journey and building it on my own, while learning everything. I am learning jQuery as I go along, and it is an uphill climb.<p>So, right now, in my moment of vulnerability. What I am looking for are a number of things. 1) Do you guys think this idea is good, and would any of you want to pay for this monthly? 2) Would you be willing to sign up for an alpha? 3) Are you a strong rails developer, that are interested in working with me on the back-end for equity or delayed compensation (that might be much higher than getting paid upfront)? 4) Any encouragement that can help me get over this little slump of vulnerability I am feeling right now.<p>I know that if I am able to power through, and get this app off the ground (without running out of cash), I will be much better off...both financially and psychologically (I can't explain how long I have been wanting to do this). I am just going through a slightly rough time at the moment.<p>Thanks guys.<p>P.S. I would apply to Y-Combinator...but it's too late and am running out of cash :|",1274212576

Although modern vinyl flooring may be low in phthalate emissions, they may well have been higher in the past. I grew up with linoleum in a lot of the house, and well remember its characteristic smell (along with those of vinyl car seats and a bunch of other plastics which were widespread in the 1970s).

Torture usually stands in for that evil thing because up until very recently, everyone agreed that it was so evil that the kind of weighing you are talking about would not be countenanced.<p>Let me tell a story that may explain what I am getting at. In 1984 (the year), a feminist named Carol Cohn went to a military school to learn about strategic nuclear concepts like mutually assured destruction, first strike, credible second strike, counterforce weapons, etc. What she found was that as she became immersed in that world, she learned to make similar kinds of artificial weighings of the destruction of cities against the loss of second strike capability. The decision calculus she learned to use allowed her to think about nuclear weapons in terms of numbers and geography rather than in terms of human life (""collateral damage"").<p>""If I was unable to speak my concerns in the language, more disturbing still was that I also began to find it harder even to keep them in my own head. No matter how firm my commitment to staying aware of the bloody reality behind the words, over and over, I found that I could not keep human lives as my reference point.

1358615,comment,1358417,1358419,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I can only offer an anecdotal perspective, but would say 'not too much'. My experience in a few Euro countries with both hrdware and software startups (both as participant/employee, and as friend-of-founder) is that most startups follow one of 3 routes (or some combination thereof):<p><pre><code>  1. Friends & family capital, recycle revenue into firm\n  2. Affiliate with a university to pursue research grant\n  3. Industrial development grant from govt. agency\n</code></pre>\nThis is assuming something speculative that mightn't easily get normal bank funding, of course. And it's rather out of date.<p>I don't think this will have such a big effect on VCs. It's not so much anti-US (although protectionism is a worry) as the EU spanking the UK for the previous government's lack of financial oversight. Basically London is the European hub for finance partly thanks to history but also because the UK  has access to all EU markets but the regulator (Financial Services Authority) famously employed a 'light touch' approach. Unlike the SEC, the FSA doesn't have a thick rulebook with strict compliance, but has generally operated on a case-by-case basis, leading to a perception that it is overly biddable.<p>So the EU's position is basically that they are no longer willing to trust this 'gentleman's agreement' approach to regulation as the sole compliance regime to get access to the whole EU. There's also a bit of a sideswipe at the UK's persistent habit of wanting all the market access benefits but wanting opt-outs of any EU regulations they dislike - having one's cake and eating it, so speak. The incoming Conservative government is historically anti-EU (they still feel the EU humiliated Thatcher by inducing her to sign a treaty she didn't read properly), so to some extent the other EU countries are making the point that they don't want 5 years of being scapegoated for the inevitable deep cuts to the UK budget, or having treaty negotiations put on ice because of the British aversion to holding referenda.<p>I can understand Geithner's worry about it being a form of regulatory protectionism^ but think to a certain extent he is also playing a diplomatic game. It would be a distinct feather in his cap if he could export something similar to the SEC ruleset to Europe, which would lower the compliance burden for US firms substantially, in kind of the same way that the Norwalk Agreement seeks to harmonize US and international accounting standards to bring about a consistent global compliance regime. While the SEC has had its ups and downs in terms of regulatory consistency and responsiveness, it's generally respected for the transparency of its compliance requirements.<p>See also: <a href=""http://www.economist.com/business-finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=15759924"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economist.com/business-finance/displaystory.cfm?s...</a><p>^ Of course, protectionism already happens to a large extent, and not just with regulation. For example, many non-EU firms are headquartered in the UK to be in the middle of London's giant financial market, but domiciled in Ireland to take advantage of ~10% corporate tax rate.",1274209629

(The question I wanted the Zeo to answer was, ""is it useful to go back to bed for an hour after getting up to write an email and check on work"".  The answer is yes; I get right back into the REM sleep I was in when I got up.  It's like I never woke up at all.  I have also learned that I sleep better on my back than on my side.  When I sleep on my side, I usually wake up after a few minutes of deep sleep.  On my back, the deep sleep lasts for an hour a night or so.)<p>It's not all good, though.  Their web interface is a PITA to use (the textfields are their custom javascript code instead of textfields, and this completely breaks conkeror), and the data the device collects is encrypted so that you can't access it without their website.<p>The Zeo is worth $200, but it's not a perfect product.

I'm in class right now but I'll edit this post later (30-60 mins) with a review.<p>Edit: I agree with everything jrockway said. I've seen improvements in my sleep, but it's not a miracle device: you get what you put into it. My problem was that I was sleeping a lot (10-11 hours wasn't unusual) and still felt tired in the morning and often went back to sleep. Since using the zeo, I've been able to reduce the amount of sleep I get to a more reasonable level (7-8 hours) and I feel pretty good in the morning. I've also been waking up earlier in the morning, giving me more time to do things I want to do before going to sleep. Sometimes I was too optimistic and set the alarm too early, though, and went back to sleep anyway. That rarely happens now, however. That said, I can't way whether my improvements in sleeping are due to the zeo or just a placebo effect.<p>Having hard quantitative data lets you analyze how your habits affect your sleep. For example, it's completely obvious to me now how drinking alcohol before sleeping negatively affects your sleep. The quality of my sleep went down and I'd wake up several times during the night. I'm hoping I can figure out more things like this like jrockway talked about (it's not perfect since you can't do something like a double-blind study, but you can try to emulate the scientific method).<p>The headband is fine. The alarm clock has a similar interface to any other alarm clock. The alarm sounds are really pleasant to wake up to (no beeping). I would recommend this to more people if it weren't $200, though to me it's a bargain for sleeping better.",1274209348
