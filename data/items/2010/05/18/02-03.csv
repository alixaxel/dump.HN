Today we have QM and relativity, which contradict each other but are very complete, and just a couple nagging issues of matter vs. antimatter and how gravity, inertia, time, and subatomic particles interact.  Back then they had a couple issues with the speed of light and a couple other minor details, and famous physicists were quoted publicly as saying that a grand theory of everything was just around the corner.  And then along came Michelson and Morley and Einstein and Planck and Heisenberg and blew our understanding of the universe wide open.<p>Sadly, since we've explored domains with sane timescales and mass / energy levels pretty thoroughly, it's unlikely that new physics will result in anti-gravity hovercars or vacuum energy devices or starships or time machines any time soon.

Move it to #1.\n- edit file F (starts out in default changelist)\n- put F in changelist #1\n- send both changelists out for review.\n- edit file B based on review. Run tests to make sure both CLs work together.\n- commit one of the CL's<p>So the basic idea is that I have multiple changelists open simultaneously and the contents of the changelists are fluid. I can keep changing my mind about them until commit.<p>Of course, since Perforce CL's are file-based, this all breaks down if I want overlapping uncommitted CL's. Git handles that better, which is why I'm using Git now. But I still miss the ease of use of Perforce when working on multiple CL's. Sure, the commits in Git are only local and you can always edit them until you do a push, but it seems like I have to plan ahead more and commit more often, or I end up having to split or merge CL's using commands I'm not very comfortable with.",1274149593

So you need to design the parts they all have in common, and leave the platform specific parts to the lower bootstrapping layers; build utilities, configuration files, even host introspection (if you can ask uname(1), don't ask the user.)<p>If the SDK is for a web API or an RPC style service, then you start by designing the data-interchange format. If you have a few messages to pass around, you can create the specifications for those messages, leaving enough room for exception handling, security, logging and auditing, and most importantly versioning. E.g.<p><pre><code>   message {\n      bool: error?\n      error: error-value\n      struct: {\n         int: count\n         values\n      } result\n      float: api-version\n      struct: log-info\n   }\n</code></pre>\nThis is the prototypical message in RPC style APIs when there are few, less than 20 different messages. And this is very XML-RPC API you will ever come across.<p>Another approach is to structure the RPC API around a query language of some sort.<p>If you have many CRUD and reporting operations that act on different data types, you can roll out a SQL, or even a hash-table like set of operations over RPC/Web Services. For example, instead of having:\n   ListEmployees\n   GetEmployee\n   GetNewEmployee\n   GetUnpaidEmployees<p>ad infinitum<p>You can have a ""select"" operation, with various arguments, and take care of the query parsing on the server side.<p><pre><code>    Get(Type, Where &optional GroupBy, Having, OrderBy)\n</code></pre>\nthen to get unpaid employees (where everything after &optional is optional)<p><pre><code>    Get(""Employee"", ""payment_date <="" . Date(..), ""employee_id"")\n   </code></pre>\nOr something similar.<p>This takes a bit more work on the server side, but it's doable in a week by a good hacker. Look at the Zuora SOAP API for an example of this.<p>If you want to see a ""NoSQL"" flavor, take a look at SugarCRM's SOAP API. It's entirely getter/setter based and very clean.<p>What matters is that you treat the server side query processing as a mini compiler project, which is what it is, so don't hesitate to pull out the formal theory to make sure nothing unexpected slips past. If you cheat and whish away the complexity by coding for a best-case scenario, you lose.<p>-----<p>Those were data-oriented remote message services.
