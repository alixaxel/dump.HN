1311078,comment,1310501,1310501,0,0,SilentCal,,,"There's actually a reasonably intuitive reason this one works. (At least for me, the Taylor expansions just look like a crazy coincidence).\nIf you try to think about complex powers using the normal definition of exponentiation, you'll just get a headache. Multiply e by itself i times?<p>However, there's another way to think about exponentiation. An exponential function's derivative with respect to the exponent is proportional to the value of the function, with the base determining the constant of proportionality. This fact can be intuited. Consider the following non-rigorous observation: x^(n+1) = x * (x^n), so x^(n+1) - (x^n) = (x-1) (x^n).<p>Now think about y = e^x, where d/dx (e^x) = (e^x). In words, the growth rate of y is the current value of y. Start with e^0=1, so the growth rate is 1. If we increase x by dx, we increase y by dx. If we increase x by idx, we increase y by idx. So, if we draw a vector from the origin to the position of y on the complex plane, the vector will be in the real direction, and y will be increasing in the complex direction, perpendicular to said vector. So the absolute value of y isn't increasing.<p>Now, in general, whatever the value of y, an increase of x by idx will increase y by iydx. Multiplication by i has the effect of a ninety-degree rotation to the left in the complex plane; try some examples if you don't accept this. So, whatever the current value of y, a small increase in x will move y perpendicular to the vector pointing to y. This results in a circular motion on the complex plane, as long as the i component of x is increased. When y gets halfway through this circle, it's back on the real axis, at -1. When does it get there? Well, since y has moved in a circle of radius 1, it has traveled a distance (not displacement) of magnitude pi to get through a semicircle. Since |dy/dx| started as one, and hasn't changed, that means the absolute value of x has increased by pi. Since we have only increased the imaginary component of x, then x must be i * pi.\nSo y = -1 when x = i * pi. e^(i * pi)= -1; e^(i * pi) +1 = 0.",1272741839

A similar marine rig spill in Australia^ last year took two months to alleviate by drilling a relief well and pumping mud into it; as with all drilling, several attempts are usually necessary to hit a suitably high-pressure part of the field. And the largest estimate for the output of the Montara spill was only 2000 barrels/day; this one is thought to be leaking between 3-5000b/d (1 barrel/~40 gallons).<p>And that spill was considerably farther from shore, with a continental shelf limiting the amount of oil that reached south-east Indonesia.

1311047,comment,1309403,1310395,0,0,codyrobbins,,,"Unfortunately I think people have a tendency here to downvote comments they disagree with rather than weighing them on their merits. Although I concede that perhaps it had something to do with the Nazi stripper comment ;)<p>I completely and unequivocally disagree with almost everything you said, though. I’m not entirely sure whether you’re speaking legally or on the level of what you think the company ‘should’ be doing from a moral perspective, but I think you’re speaking from a moral perspective.<p>But you’re attempting to say that the price does not matter, and here you can’t ignore the legal aspect, because price most certainly does matter in that respect. If you are paying for the service and there is therefore an actual honest-to-goodness contract between you and the business, then they do have a responsibility to continue to provide the service as stipulated in the contract. However, even then, it’s common for businesses to stop providing a service; if, for example, they refund your money. IANAL, but I imagine the Uniform Commercial Code provides for this sort of eventuality. Look at Lala shutting down: Apple decided to entirely remove the service off the face of the earth, leaving users entirely out in the cold. And they didn’t even refund anyone’s money—they just gave out iTunes gift certificates. I personally don’t think there’s anything wrong with this: they are making calculated decisions and they need to be free to make these decisions. Users <i>must</i> have an implied underlying understanding that the business may make changes like this.<p>But in the case of Posterous no monetary consideration is even changing hands and so the obligation is necessarily far more nebulous if there is one at all.<p>‘Sure,’ you’ll say again, ‘but I’m not talking legally, I’m speaking morally.’ OK—I’ll say again that I don’t think a business has any obligation to live up to whichever crazy expectation you happen to have dreamed up concerning their free service. Whatever your particular understanding of the service you are getting happens to be is completely orthogonal to what the business is going to decide to provide. If there’s one crazy guy in Butte, Montana who thinks Posterous is a dating site, and then Posterous decides to remove avatar images from the site, the guy in Montana just can’t complain that Posterous has ruined his ability to use the site as a way to look at pictures of potential dates. It’s their product, it’s their right to make any change they want.<p>Businesses, and especially web startups, need to be free to stay agile and change direction on a dime. They need to iterate to find a business model that works. Just because they were doing one thing in the past, people have no right to think the business is therefore forever after obligated to continuing doing so in the future.<p>I do think that it is absolutely within Google’s rights, if it so chose, to start charging money for Gmail tomorrow. It may break an unwritten contract, but that doesn’t mean they can’t nor shouldn’t do it if they decide that it’s in their best interest to do so. You may say from a practical standpoint that they’d lose 95% of their users if they did such a thing. But they are completely free to decide to make a change that drives off 95% of their users. I assume they would have calculated that the money they will make from the 5% of remaining users is worth it. Gmail is a bad example, though, because obviously Google is giving away the service for free because it brings in tons of eyeballs on their ads. If ad revenue in Gmail fell precipitously with no hope of coming back, do you think Google wouldn’t really start charging for it or cancel it altogether?<p>It’s ironic that you talk about ‘unwritten terms’ between the business and user, because someone already posted the Posterous terms of service, and it explicitly says that they might do this. So there are no ‘unwritten terms’—there are written ones and they explicitly allow for this, so it’s moot.",1272740985

The reason they need to recognize it as revenue is because if they didn't, they would be subject to an ever ballooning set of obligations to provide service to people who don't redeem their prepayed minutes.<p>So why does Skype take your money after a few short months of inactivity instead of, say, two years?\n1. Part of it is that current tax law requires that you recognize the money as a gain before too long a period (this increases profits and tax revenues, btw) \n2. Skype decision makers decided to go with the flow on the issue, at a cost to customer satisfaction. (""Hey, they want us to take the free money, let's take the free money"")<p>As an aside, redemption rates after 3 months are ridiculously low. Since they are going to get to keep the money regardless, Skype's only gain is on the service they wouldn't have to provide versus a longer grace period. Which considering profit margins and so forth, is likely negligible. So like I said, it is standard practice, but it's also bad business.<p>For more, look into the matching principal: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_principle"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_principle</a>",1272740425
