Looking at his income report, he is already making 50% of his income (and almost all his passive income) from stockphotos and ebooks. Comparing this to his current income from ads, it is obviously more profitable. I accept that he has more ad-based projects coming up, but in terms of effort, is producing ad-based software really going to be worth it? Another downside is that photos and books don't need the same level of ongoing maintenance as software.<p>Perhaps someone here has some insight into how much money software with embedded ads can realistically make.",1274104752

1354251,comment,1354179,1354189,0,0,nudge,,,"Nice infographic! In answer to your questions (just my opinions, mind):<p>1) The industry average (at least from sources talking about it) is around 1-2% of all signups upgrading, so you're at par there. I think, however, that this is not very helpful. Continuing the 'par' theme, what would you say is a 'good' handicap in golf? There's no such number, really, except in relation to certain goals. Likewise, I think your conversion rate should just be one of the things that you tweak in order to maximize your profit, which is most important thing in the end. Be aware that it may be much better to have a 1% conversion rate at a higher price than a 5% conversion rate at a lower one. Or vice versa.<p>2) I'm not sure about whether this is good or not, I'm afraid. It's quite a unique service you're providing - there's not a lot to use as a benchmark. Something to take into account is that people generally upgrade when they hit a 'pain point' in the app. That's when I go over my dropbox free storage limit, for example. For Bingo Card Creator it's when you want to print the cards you've created (I think). The pain point in your app is unclear. What is it people are using it for? Perhaps you don't want to limit the number of events, but rather the usage of the created timeline? Upgrade if you want to save it as an image, print it, embed it in your website, save it online etc. Remember that the more people put into something, the more willing they will be to pay to get past the pain point (it is a hassle for me to signup with anyone other than dropbox if I'm already using them, for example). Also think about the scenarios in which you are saving people a huge amount of time. For Bingo Card Creator, it's teachers spending hours messing about with Word trying to make different cards. The app saves you that time. Is there an equivalent for your users, or a particular subset of them?<p>Just some random thoughts there.<p>As a final thought, related to some of the above points, think about whether it is a good idea to stop people entering all the data they want to enter, which you're doing. Perhaps it might be better to let them enter as much as they want, but require an upgrade to stop it all just disappearing (or all but 10 events of it disappearing) as soon as they leave the site (or 24 hours later, or whatever). Then you've got people putting more into your app, and you're introducing a more natural pain point: pay up to keep all the work you've just done, or to print it, or to share it in its entirety.",1274102398
