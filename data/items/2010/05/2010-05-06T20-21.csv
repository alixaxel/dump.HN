- make the whole discover, share, etc buttons clickable.  Not just the bottom text<p>- i'm not convinced why i want to signup?  Give me a reason. Probalby just one reason.  Test 3 reasons and see which one gets more signups<p>- i feel overwhlemed by singup options.  which do you care about most? focus on that.  why even have such dominance of the ""login"" call to action? Most people that come to your site don't hvae an account yet.  Creat account should be primary action. Sign-in shuld be a little link.  people will find that.<p>-the header is too tall. reduce that and get teh important shit higher up on the page<p>- i signed in using facebook.  why take me to this other page where i have to do other stuff?  The location thing is broken. This page doesn't look like your website - therefore a user trusts it less. unify the experience.  Is there a ""start"" button in this page? I can't see one. I don't even know how to submit my email address.<p>k, that should be some good stuff to work with",1273179531

I think you're probably actually implying that you object to him promoting optimism, even though it is not accurate. Two counters to this:<p>1. a <i>realist</i> can use these ideas to be more accurate in their thinking. By being aware of when we are generalizing and personalizing, we can reconsider whether that is accurate or not. Although he said that a pessimist is more accurate than an optimist, it seems that a pessimist is not perfectly accurate, because pessimism creates distortions when <i>over</i> generalizing or <i>over</i> personalizing.<p>2. Your premise here, of insisting on positive knowledge, is a trap, because many things are unknown, and when failure has a low cost, experimentation is the rational strategy. Optimism supports this approach (you don't take failure seriously, and you keep trying.) But when failure has a high cost, being cautious is a more rational strategy. Pessimism supports this.<p>That is, for acting in the world, one should weight probabilities of success/failure by costs and rewards/dangers (as opposed to only observing, in order to discover probabilities for their own sake, as a scientist might, who isn't concerned about making something happen).<p>3. a bonus thought from my 101 Philosophy: studies have shown that athletes who <i>believe</i> they will perform better, actually do perform better. That is, an inaccurate estimation becomes accurate.

Thus we see some of the more financially powerful nations like Germany stumping up billions of Euros to avoid Greece defaulting, as long as Greece agrees to some pretty heavy ""austerity measures"" over the coming months and years so the money isn't just being thrown away because they're going to default eventually anyway.<p>Those measures in turn have already led to fatal riots in the streets, as to the average non-economist citizen, taxes are about to skyrocket, pension/retirement arrangements are getting significantly worse, etc. and no-one really knows why.<p>The trouble has actually been brewing for several years, since things like the Olympics broke their budget dramatically, but it's only with the recent worldwide economic conditions that it has become really obvious.<p>That's my understanding of why Greece in particular is in trouble today, but a somewhat similar story could be told about several other European nations, hence the general malaise in the markets.<p>I suspect this is a bit of a mountains and molehills situation. The odds of the rest of the Euro-zone actually allowing Greece to go bankrupt must be fairly slim, but of course the price of bailing them out is then being carried by those other countries and it's not loose change, so the markets are going to take a substantial hit all the same.",1273178636

1325619,comment,1324954,1325310,0,0,decode,,,"> What's the big deal about facebook? And what did we ever do before?<p>Facebook has solved two standing problems for my social groups.  Your friends and acquaintances may be using it similarly, without you knowing it.  Or maybe not.<p>1. Easy and effective photo sharing.  It's easy to upload pictures and tag the people in them.  If someone uploads a photo with you in it, you will get notified.  The end effect of this is that everyone at events, outings, and parties gets copies of the photos taken there.<p>What did we do before?  For many of my social groups, nothing.  Those photos were not shared.  For two of my social groups, we set up dedicated sites for sharing our photos.<p>2. Event planning.  The events interface works as well as any other I've seen.  And if everyone is already on Facebook, it's not as annoying as evite or some third party site where people don't have accounts.  I had a friend that refused to get a Facebook account for years and we always had to call or email him separately from the rest of the group.  This created more work for the event organizer (which was perceived as somewhat rude) and messed up the attendee counts, because he wasn't in the RSVP numbers from the Facebook event.<p>What did we do before?  Played telephone tag and sent group emails.  This works fine for smaller events with just a few people, but it doesn't scale past about 5 or 6 people.  It also doesn't work in the tell-your-friends-to-invite-their-friends scenario where you still want RSVPs from everyone.",1273177740
