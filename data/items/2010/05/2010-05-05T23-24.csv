But iPad won't sell for 300K piece everyday, that only happened the first day... actually it can sell! Yes, but there is an interesting point (so that it sells at such high rate): Apple ""must"" dominate the market.<p>For the iPhone, the competition is now fierce: Android, BlackBerry, Palm, Windows mobile and Nokia! Nokia is already a major player, they won't let Apple take the market easily and cheaply. They'll do marketing, new phones and crazy things to preserve their position.<p>That said, as competition is getting though, Apple has got to spend more on marketing and improving their products (taking down their profit, even if their sales are up, because they are spending more). Only if they dominate the market, then your investment will pay back.<p>My advice is: don't get in this stock.

1323028,comment,1322791,1322791,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Assertion #3: It is in the VCs' interest to acquire the most ownership of a company at the lowest price with the least risk.<p>Not quite - the investor's interest depends on their strategy, but it's balancing their desired return, resources, and risk. If you own 60% of a company, you've got to manage it, pay attention to it, keep a close eye on the books. If you own 5% of a company, and a savvy honorable investor owns 40%, and the rest is spread between founders, employee, and other investors - you don't have to watch it so closely. So you might get a better deal buying 5% at a worse valuable than 60% at a better valuable - because of the resources/time that will be required of you.<p>Investors want to maximize their return - but they also need to consider their strategy, what resources they have, how active they want to be, what their time horizon is, and so on, and so on. Saying they're after the biggest piece possible for the least money isn't quite right. If taking a bigger piece of the company makes the company less likely to make it, a smart investor won't do that.",1273103101

So you can't just say ""Oh, old people <i>always</i> think young people are too risque. Get over it.""  There is some structure to the current trend, and it seems worthwhile to try to explain it (though the OP fails, IMO).<p>Now, that doesn't mean that the threshold for human embarrassment has been static since before the industrial revolution; looking at history, it has certainly varied dramatically across time and space.  It's probably not random, so tracing it's cause would be interesting.<p>Further, I don't think many people are going to go to the extreme relativist standpoint and say that all thresholds for embarrassment are equally (un-)valuable.  It's not hard to make arguments for why it's a good thing people are too embarrassed to have sex in public (though I'm sure there are a few extreme bullet-biters).  So then the question is, can you defend what you think is an optimal threshold for embarrassment, whether or not it coincides with the current threshold?

Under the hood, it's a similar cloud approach, but more economical for those with volumes or steady encoding work.  Customers--or their end users--can upload at any rate (volumes of upload sessions at once through gateways located around the country for low latency), or ship drives. The queues process at a steady predictable rate, delivering content directly to the network.<p>In the course of processing countless libraries for clients, we've found they tend to have such unique ideas about the end result that a ""one size fits all"" web service often doesn't meet their needs out of the box.<p>So, we also offer Windows Media (WMV), Silverlight (VC-1), Ogg Theora, and cross-player H.264 encoding, adaptive bitrate encoding for Apple devices, iPhone video rotation, automatic thumbnails, web postbacks so you don't have to poll, incoming files of up to 4.7GB in size, and arbitrarily complex encoding requirements.<p>To your point about images + sound, for example, some clients supply metadata as XML, and using the metadata we generate pre-roll and post-roll video footage that stitches onto the transcoded video.<p>(We also have a consumer service that bundles both encoding and storage into a single ""per minute"" price.

There is no need to introduce an expensive new technology stack for an already solved problem.<p>On efficiency, heh.  Hundreds of thousands of items had been given arbitrary tags (on average over a dozen per item, and the same tag could be given repeatedly), and the question was to identify for each item the other items which were ""most closely related"" based on shared tags.<p>The fundamental problem with doing this in any kind of a database is that the fastest access path for a given fact is a lookup in an index.  Which means a binary search through a data structure to find out the page and row number the data was on, followed by parsing that page in memory to locate the row, and extract the wanted information from that row.  This is absolutely the fastest form of lookup available.<p>The equivalent operation in C++ is access an array by index and pull an element out of a struct.
