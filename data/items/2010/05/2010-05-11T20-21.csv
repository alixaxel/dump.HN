If I was starting today, I would use Ruby or Python.<p>2. Built-in documentation, college classes and web documentation. Generally I find documentation far more useful than tutorials. I would highly recommend checking out Zed Shaw's new book: Learn Python the Hard Way (<a href=""http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index</a>).<p>3. I don't think I've ever learned anything when I didn't have something specific to build. Just playing around trying to learn stuff never works for me. I need to have a reason to learn, a project that needs the technology I'm trying to learn.<p>4. I've had very little direct guidance in learning to program. I had my professors, which helped me mostly by introducing me to the technologies and giving me things to build. I've had various people on StackOverflow help me with particular. Mostly, I am guided by inspiration, not direction interaction. People like Zed Shaw inspire me. People like why. Sometimes libraries inspire me. LINQ is incredibly inspiring. As is pyparsing. These people and libraries give me an idea of what I want my contributions to the programming world to look like.<p>5. Best guidance in my mind is giving you a tool and then giving you something to build with it. I never would have found Ruby without one of my professors (or I would have found it a lot later). I may never have cared without Ruby Quiz and Rails inspiring me to build things. This is why I think you should check out Zed's python book. He teaches the language by giving you the tools and then asking you to do things with them.",1273610710

Similarly Freshbooks redid their invoicing some time ago, and found that people overwhelmingly preferred the new version, yet conversions to paying customer were better when people were given the old version and forced to figure out that they could change it on their own.

The objective was avoiding the degradation I had seen on other social networks. Hi5 and Orkut were the experiences where I based this reasoning. This was 3-4 years ago, I still hadn't used facebook.<p>One of my ideas was to give users access to sponsored SMS's. They could send a SMS and would have to choose some sponsor to that SMS, in the bottom of the SMS it would be included a slogan of the sponsor (20-40 characters). This could also work as user acquisition by sponsoring the platform itself. <evil> The friends contact information could also be used somehow </user><p>The strong points for this idea was that the profiles of users would have been richer to the advertisers allowing better targeting. Consumer brands are strongly tied to events, and I suppose this would facilitate getting advertisers. It would also enable to give brands opportunities to sponsor smaller events (long tail on the event advertising market).<p>Ads targeting is in a whole new level nowadays and I don't believe it would be a real competitive advantage, but maybe it could be sold as so. The success of this idea also depends a lot on how much people value free SMS's. Here in Portugal SMS's are free inside the same operator but I see younger people doing big gimmicks to get free SMS's to other operators. The effort people are willing to put to achieve that is crucial, I don't know how well that applies in other contexts.<p>Could we see something similar on Twitter? Instead of a sponsored SMS, a sponsored Tweet? If they give me the possibility of tweeting from my cell phone for free in exchange of a few characters and ads noise I would do it.",1273609352

Maybe this works in some cases, but that doesn't mean it's not also a mistake.<p>It's like that joke about the guy who lost his keys in the alley behind a bar one night. His friend finds him on the sidewalk looking under a street light, and asks him why he's not looking in the alley. The guy says ""It's too dark in the alley, I can't see a thing!"" The moral of the story: when faced with a difficult real-world problem that you don't know how to solve with your current skillset, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to try to change the problem into a different one that you do know how to solve. Maybe you don't need good design, but if you do, you should get a designer, and ignore blog posts about how pretty things are for girls.",1273608247
