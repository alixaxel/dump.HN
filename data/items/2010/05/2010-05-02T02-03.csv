The network relies on its members connecting and conversing; that's how the network derives its value. Facebook's network is valuable because it is the <i>de facto</i> online identity for many millions of people. And to engender and promote network effects, Facebook must necessarily expose information about you to other users. How else would anyone connect with you?<p>Sure, it'd be nice for you to make yourself invisible at a moment's notice.

It stayed alive to the end of the show, then immediately died. Apple charged me $800 to have it fixed. I had to have it repaired twice again after that (both of those were free, since the previous two repairs had been wrong.) During and after that, the battery failed and needed replacement four times. The last time, the Apple Genius told me that batteries are not covered after the first year, so I would have to pay for it myself. He looked at the repair history on the laptop and had sympathy, and replaced it for free.<p>To this day, the laptop does not work correctly, even though every individual component has been replaced at least once. Also, they made a typo when setting the serial number on the motherboard, which I had to tell Apple each time I had it serviced, since it didn't match the one on my AppleCare plan (replaced a B with an 8.)<p>Of course, the laptop had been working fine until a drunk hipster dumped box wine all over it. I wish the repairs had been perfect and free, but they weren't. I've gone through a lot of Apple products over the years, and this is the only one where I've had problems. All of the ones before and after have been fine, and this one had been fine until the wine.<p>Anyway, this is just an anecdote. Don't expect your own fuckups to be covered under AppleCare. It's an extended warranty, <i>not</i> insurance. If the parent is telling the truth, then he's an exception, not the rule.",1272767799

1311792,comment,1311635,1311635,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The thing I don't like about all these ways to ""improve"" HTML/CSS is that they all seem to assume the rest of the webapp ecosystem doesn't exist.<p>Take SASS's variables and arithmetic, for instance.  I agree that CSS desperately needs some way to abstract out common values.  But any decent webapp will <i>already</i> be using some sort of template system, and the template system will have some sort of variable.  Why not use it and be consistent with the rest of your UI?  If you introduce SASS into the mix, you just have to do things one way in your CSS and another way in your markup.<p>Same thing with Zen Coding.  Instead of using an editor plugin that expands abbreviations (which then have to be maintained), why not use your template system and avoid writing all that code in the first place?  If I were writing the example listed here, it'd look something like this:<p><pre><code>  <div id=menu>
    <table>
      <tr>
        {{#CELL}}<td><a href="""" class=nav></a>{{/CELL}}
    </table>

(That's using google-ctemplates because it's what I work with daily, but substitute in Django, Cheetah, Mako, or erb as necessary.)<p>Yes, there's still room for improvement, and yes, I wish my editor were more aware of available template variables.  But I also don't have to maintain the 5 separate <td> tags once I've typed them out, I can change one and have its updates be reflected across all the generated code.  I can avoid those pesky closing tags by simply not typing them; the HTML spec doesn't require them, all browsers handle it fine, and it saves end-user latency as well.

It would be a huge boon to Android phones.<p>Google groups is broken for some people, and I'd stay away from using it as a building block. Lots of people have negative opinions about Wave, me included. I don't even know if Buzz would help in any of this, the launch was so botched I never looked at it; people have told me it wouldn't work well for anything like this.<p>Posterous or Tumblr could do it too. Google doesn't seem to be very motivated in integrating their various acquired apps; maybe this would be that motivation. Or maybe Posterous or Tumblr might find some motivation in this.<p>It need not, maybe should not, and probably could not compete with Facebook. That's not a reason to not do it. Jones Soda does pretty well, yet I doubt if they think of themselves as a Coca Cola killer.<p>Whether Google or someone else does it, I'd like:<p><i>GENERAL</i><p>- Total control.  I don't want to be a control freak, I want to be a control <i>super</i> freak. I decide exactly what is private, shared and public. Everything that can be shared in any way should be obvious, and the settings interface for controlling privacy should be very obvious in: a) what setting controls what feature, b) what feature is controlled by what setting. If you have to guess how to change a feature's exposure, or what feature a setting controls, then you don't have control.<p>- Long-lived settings. New features should never expose tomorrow what was not exposed yesterday. That's just so disrespectful on facebook's part.<p>- New features should begin with the most restrictive privacy settings.<p>- No apps or third parties. Make your money through advertising or paid features. If you're Google then you already have great advertising revenue and this just ties into it.<p>- No friend can expose anything of mine to any greater degree than I have explicitly exposed it.<p><i>DISCOVERABILITY</i><p>- If I want to be invisible at any level, then I should be invisible as long as the rivers run and the winds blow, until I change it.<p>Invisibility includes:<p><pre><code>  - The outside world. I'm either discoverable to anyone outside the system, or I'm invisible, according to my settings.

  - People inside the system. I'm either discoverable inside the system, or I'm invisible.

  - My groups of friends. I'm either discoverable to my friends' groups, or I'm invisible.
</code></pre>
<i>EXPOSURE</i><p>- I control what parts of my data are exposed, and how far out. This is both independent of discoverability and cooperative with it. For example, no matter how far out I might expose a photo album, it can't be exposed farther out than my discoverability. On the other hand no object needs to be as exposed as my maximum discoverability.<p>If I'm invisibile outside the system, then I can't set the exposure of a photo album to outside the system. If I need a photo album or something else to be exposed farther out than my discoverability, then I'd need to create that album outside the system (say, as a picassa album in a different, public account). I might be able to link to such an album from inside (and that link would have the same discoverability and exposure protections as any other object).<p><i>FUNCTIONS</i><p>- Discoverability. Anyone can discover me, as long as they're within one of my discoverability spheres. If I've set my discoverability to ""world"" then you can find me through search or browse. You can send a message to me if I've enabled that (with enough hurdles to discourage spam). If you're a member of the system you can request to friend me.<p>If my discoverability is more restrictive, then you might only be able to discover me if you're already a member. Or you might be able to discover me only if you're a member of one of my friends' other groups.<p>- Exposure. Objects that you post or share have a settable exposure level. Posting objects to a group gives those objects the exposure that you previously associated with that group.<p>- Chat.<p>- Alerts. If a friend logs in while I'm in, I want to know it, unless they've set that data to hidden.<p>- The usual. Can post comments, pictures, music, books, links, ""other stuff"" and have conversations about them. Post things about yourself in your profile, with different parts of you profile's exposure individually controllable. Be alerted to comments in conversations related to you or your posts, and changes to posted objects.<p>- A group of one. I should be my own group, similar to how some Linux distros create a group whose name is your login and whose membership is just you. I may want to keep track of things just for myself. I may want to stage new additions, initially to just me, and then exposed to a gradually wider audience as I see fit. I may want to pull some things in to private that were exposed.<p>Everyone starts as a member of their own group of one (""self"" ?), unexposed and undiscoverable. You have to explicitly make yourself more discoverable, and you have to explicitly expose any objects in your group of one.<p>- Explicit groups of two or more. I should be able to explicitly band together with other people and form a group. Everyone in the group is aware of everyone else in the group. We can all post, converse and share. The group can be invisible or discoverable. I can expose my membership in the group to any group outsider who can see the group, or I can hide my membership from anyone outside the group. The email analogy to this might be cc:.<p>- Implicit groups of two or more. I should be able, on my own, to place people and groups inside of implicit groups that only I am aware of. If I post to an implicit group, each individual or group member of an implicit group receives the post or other object, and can carry on a conversation or other activity related to the object, but no individual or group within one of my implicit groups is aware of any other members of the implicit group; they aren't even aware that they themselves are part of one of my implicit groups, although they might guess from my style of writing. The email analogy to this might be bcc:.<p>The names of the two previous group types, explicit and implicit, may not be the best names. I initially described them as public and private, but those terms had too much confusing overlap with the notions of discoverability and exposure.<p>- Some groups owned by individuals and some groups owned equally by members. Not sure about this. Worth thinking about.<p>- Group union and intersection. I'm a little fuzzy on this one. Say you broadcast post an object to two groups. Person A is a member of one group, B is a member of the other group, yet the two people A and B have no relationship to each other within the system. If people A and B's discoverability settings would allow it, then they should see each other's comments related to the posted object and be able to take part in that object's conversations with each other as if they were both members of the same group. If their discoverability settings would not allow either to discover the other, then they should not see the others' comments.<p>If this function were done poorly, then gaps in conversations related to an object might be disorienting.<p>- Acknowledgement of the outside world. Under my control and choice, I should be able to make automatic tweets, or posts to my external blog, etc, based on what I post and where inside the system. I should also be able to make incoming posts from the outside, like ping.fm to twitter and facebook.<p>- Data migration. I should be able to export part or all of my data quickly and easily.<p>- Data ownership. I should be able to change the exposure of data that I post, and to delete it.<p>- Existence ownership. If I leave, I should be able to totally delete myself. Or, if I want, I could de-activate myself. But it shouldn't take searching outside the system to find a little known method for deletion. If I delete posts or data that are part of conversations, the system should insert a placeholder, but if it's mine I get to kill it.<p><i>IMPLEMENTATION</i><p>For this part I'll assume Google is implementing it, because they already have all the parts and we're all familiar with them. Applies equally to Posterous, Tumblr or a player to be named later, acknowledging that they would have more to build.<p>The fundamental activity in the system is posting objects and having conversations about them. An object might be text, media, a link, etc.<p>Posting objects could be handled very well by blogger. You can put pictures and links in a post, and there's a comment mechanism. The comments would continue the conversation.<p>You could also handle posts and reading with gmail, because it has excellent conversation threading. If you use gmail you'll have to be <i>very</i> careful about leakage, in or out.<p>Slashdot's forum has excellent threading, for inspiration.<p>Alerts and keeping up to date could be handled by logging in a lot and reading your stream, or via Google Reader, or by email/gmail, or any combination of them. Again, be very careful about leakage in and out.<p>Be nice to be able to post via email/gmail (hi Posterous!).<p>Media and albums by Picassa, but not just photos, anything a member has the right to post: books, audio, video.<p>Implementing some of this might be a challenge. Pick a subset. Iterate.<p><i>UI, UX, UXB</i><p>If you find anything looking like any part of Facebook, you're probably doing it wrong.<p>User interface should tend toward minimal. There should be zero or one way to do everything. UI elements should not suddenly disappear, to be found again after a frustrating search. Facebook recently made the logout link hard to find, burying it in the Account menu. Probably because they want to discourage you from logging out. Don't do stuff like that, it's disrespectful, and even if there isn't evil intent it encourages discussions of evil.<p>You should be able to easily choose where anything will be posted, and not have to worry at all that you might not understand where it's going.<p>When you view anything, you should get some indication of who else can see it, general by default but able to drill down to groups and individuals if you like.<p>Name everything well, once, and use only that name, everywhere.<p>You shouldn't need a help system. But someone will want it, and it should be worth reading. You should also be able to get to help for specific functions, from the context of that function, without having to abandon your context and go into ""reading the manual"" mode.<p>There's probably more.",1272766801

Well, Roberts Rules of Order imposes a structure on events that requires timing, so for instance, if somebody gets the floor, then one minute or two minutes later, we warn them their time is expiring.<p>The epiphany was twofold.  First, I realized that passing an anonymous function pointer to a queue is a lot more general than defining, say, a bunch of event names.  This makes the design of the event queue really lightweight.<p>The second part of the epiphany was that anonymous function pointers in Perl <i>are</i> closures, with lexical bindings to the environment at the time the pointer is created.  So my event queue reduced to a simple list of times and closures - magic!  Events are entirely general and you can spin off just the event queue logic as a separate module without restricting any later options about what types of event you'll be queuing.  It was probably the most satisfying programming I'd done in a decade.<p>I should note that I stopped doing programming for my bread and butter in 2003 or 2004, and switched to technical translation instead (easy to quote, no debugging, no disputes about what was done or whether it met the user's expectations - it's like programming for hire without any of the downsides!)

1311743,comment,1310844,1310844,0,0,locacorten,,,"Here's what's going on at a high-level.<p>1. Somebody discovered a security vulnerability in the implementation of a network protocol (i.e., a bug). The bug can be exploited remotely apparently. Which means that somebody from far away can break into your machine if your software has this bug.<p>2. This was used by someone else to push forward their agenda. In particular, their point is that newer dynamic root of trust trusted technologies are better than older static root of trust technologies. The goal of these technologies is to make a piece of code execute securely (i.e., without being compromised or modified by an attacker). Static root of trust can make a piece of code execute securely only by trusting <i>the entire</i> software stack from boot time until the execution of the piece of code. Dynamic root of trust bypasses this entire software stack -- it allows you to just verify that the piece of code hasn't been modified before it's being executed.<p>3. Now, the bug from step #1 can (in theory) be used for someone to ""break"" into the persistent storage of the NIC and compromise the NIC ""forever"" by changing its firmware to a ""bad"" firmware. This won't be caught by the static root of trust technology because such technologies do not typically check the firmware of a NIC card at boottime. And thus, in theory, the dynamic root of trust is ""better"" because it doesn't rely on making sure that the entire software stack remains uncompromised.<p>Now .. my opinions.<p>a. Remote vulnerabilities are very problematic because they lead to remote exploits. The lesson here -- get very experienced/senior/skeptical designers to implement networking protocols. Here's where it's worth hiring the smart guy. Implementing a new protocol in C from scratch is crazy. I'd fire this guy if he worked for me.<p>b. Dynamic root of trust is better than static root of trust on paper. In practice, dynamic root of trust is very hard to implement in a way that stays secure while doing something useful. When executing in ""secure"" mode with dynamic root of trust, you cannot use interrupts which basically means that's almost impossible to do anything useful (like sending or receiving a network packet).",1272765738
