My dad had read all the newspaper articles (in Kolkata, India) about the iPad and based on the tech-journalists' observations, decided that the iPad is a toy and can't do anything useful. When I told him I am thinking of buying an iPad for my mom for her birthday, he said ""No! iPad sucks. Just buy us a regular laptop.""<p>I explained to him that for the first time in the history of computers, there is now a low-priced portable computer that he doesn't need me to fix or setup. It won't get viruses, it is easy enough that my grandma can use it, and it just works like the iTouch that he is so familiar with. Suddenly it clicked in his head. He asked ""So this will let me go to Gmail, Facebook, all the news sites?"" I said yes. ""And this will have games that your mom can play all day? And it will let us read your blog and see your photos? All of it wirelessly?"" I said yes.<p>He said ""Ok. Get two then."" I said it doesn't have webcam yet so I'll give you one now and next year or so when it gets a webcam, I'll buy two. You'll get one and I'll keep one and we can video-chat from our sofas across the world (I'm in Florida). He was happy with that.<p>I think the real problem is that even though most tech-journalists aren't programmers or engineers, they still align their interests with the techies and try to think like Slashdotters: ""No wireless. Less space than a nomad. Lame."" Good journalists see through the different layers and can more realistically describe a technology for what it's worth. Yes, it sucks that the iPad needs a regular computer before it can even be turned on and it sucks that the iPad doesn't have a webcam. But think about it.

I recall a similar example where someone asked how to work out factorials in C++, and was presented with a highly efficient answer... because it used template metaprogramming and generated that answer at compile time.<p>This was certainly clear in the related FAQs last time I checked, so anyone who asks a homework question without making any effort to solve it themselves is not only lazy but also incapable of following basic netiquette.

My friend and I want to bootstrap a startup as a nights-and-weekends effort. The first thing we want to do is to agree on a contract that will keep things fair if one of us doesn't contribute as much as the other, or bails out completely. After reading HN threads on founder disputes, we have so far come up with the following. Please critique, who knows what trouble you might save us down the road with your suggestions.<p>Our agreement so far:<p>1. 50/50 ownership (subject to vesting)<p>2. Four year vesting schedule (25% at 12 months, 50% at 24 months, so on...)<p>3. A commitment to work x hours per week.<p>4. Some rule where a founder who fails to meet that commitment for a prolonged period can be fired.<p>5. Eventual compensation, at some percentage of market consulting rate ($50/hr? $100/hr?) from revenue for the founder who worked more, if the other founder fell short of the commitment.<p>This may seem pretty complicated, but our goal is to set something up that will ease tension rather than create it.

But to imitate the ugliness smacks of cargo cultism -- reproducing side effects in hopes of receiving a similar result. To me, the commonality shared by the sites you mentioned isn't their aesthetics, but rather that they represented either a radical innovation or a radical improvement over existing services. I DO believe this was a result of their engineering focus in the early stages, a side effect of which was poor aesthetics, but I don't think it's a clear indicator that an engineer-driven product cannot also benefit from smart design. Google's move to break the Altavista portal mode of thinking and present the user with a large, isolated search box was first and foremost a design decision.<p>I think Mint is a good example of design driving success. Mint is largely built on the Yodlee platform, but they made the interface their primary focus. I don't get any information from Mint that I can't get on my bank's website. But since signing up for Mint, I check my accounts twice as frequently, classify all of my purchases, track my financial history, and set budgets. I didn't have to wrestle myself into these habits, either -- they came naturally because Mint made them easy and available. And honestly, I would never have trusted my bank account information to a site that looked like early-days eBay.",1273674119

Spolsky used the term Architecture Astronaut, which I definitely was going in to my first job out of college. Now, I rarely think about architecture up front, I think about requirements and the fastest path to them, with the post step of eliminating repetition. This ties into YAGNI and 7 Habits and OODA and all kinds of different decision making strategies that it just feels right through and through.  Architecture seems to fall out from that and makes up for a lot of my own failings for design.<p>Point being: we're all at certain level X, and our relative level compared to other people isn't important, it's what we do with our personal level to develop and deploy projects.
