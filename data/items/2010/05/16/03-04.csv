I suppose if people keep predicting this indefinitely, someday it will become true.<p>In the meantime, new programming tasks are invented faster than the old tasks are industrialized.<p>""Once you get better at programming it is more like knitting or weaving than puzzling.""<p>This is up to you.  Was building Google, Amazon, Linux, Firefox, iPhone OS, etc. etc. etc. more like knitting or weaving than puzzling?  Maybe what you are saying is that most programmers aren't good enough to build those kinds of products, or would just rather stick to their knitting and weaving.  That I would agree with.<p>""Some programmers are better at this than others and can solve more complex problems.""<p>This is trivially true of any cognitive task.",1273982309

Most people aren't very technical, so they're going to use one networking site, and guess what? It's going to be what ""everyone else"" is using.<p>So, sure, you still have the choice to use it. But it's not like, say, system software, in that if you don't like the primary offering, you can go implement your own or download somebody else's.<p>That being said, I've still found absolutely no reason to use Facebook, and as such I don't.",1273982306

I'm a self-taught, 28 year old in NYC, and I've been programming rails for 2 years now.  I co-founded an education startup where I was the sole developer, but I can't keep eating hotdogs and ramen after 18 months and being essentially homeless (I sleep on a friend's couch).<p>So now I'm looking for a job, but I don't know what to ask for as far as salary is concerned.  I feel awkward asking for even $25/hour (#rubyonrails flipped out when I said that).<p>I'm not having that many problems getting interviews, but the part about the salary mystifies me.  One HR guy asked me what salary I was looking for and I wasn't ready for that question at all, so I mumbled, ""Oh, fourty... two... ?"" and he said ""... sooo, 50?""<p>So, one part is me not knowing what the salary range for a programmer is, let alone a rails programmer in NYC.  I guess the other part is me selling myself short.<p>Since I'm self-taught and always worked alone, I don't have another developer or shop that can say, ""oh, hey, this guy is smart"".  I also don't have enough OSS contributions or a stupid blog so no one can see that I'm not a complete idiot, but I feel like one because I've never worked alongside a competent developer who can mentor me in the areas that I'm lacking in (BDD, a smarter git workflow).  When Ryan Bates and Yehuda Katz are your only metric with which to compare yourself, you feel pretty small.<p>Any advice is greatly appreciated!",1273982281

1351321,comment,1351074,1351074,0,0,CitizenKane,,,"I've heard Stallman's arguments quite a bit and every time I hear them they don't ring entirely true.  Pratically speaking, the freedoms granted by free software are primarily meaningful to developers.  If you can't modify the software (or have no concept of what source code is) these freedoms largely become meaningless.  By the same token, if the source code is absolutely terrible the freedom to modify it is next to meaningless (I've had to deal with this issue a fair amount myself).<p>There seem to be a couple of implicit arguments in this that I find interesting.  First, that others aren't to be trusted.  Second, that software is in no way an invention.<p>Regarding the first, I think that for most people they have to rely on the developer of the software they use.  If the developer decides to stop working on it they can get screwed.  With open source software they may be able to find another developer, but then they are simply at the mercy of the other developer.  Their lack of freedom isn't shaped by whether the software is open source or not, it's shaped by their lack of knowledge.<p>Regarding the second, it seems that the argument for free software is an argument for free speech.  This in essence means that software is exlusively a work of creativity (an thus copyrightable) and is not a work of invention (thus not patentable).  I don't completely buy this argument.  I think software is unique in that it has aspects of both creativity and invention.  On one end of the spectrum _why would definitely epitomize the creative aspect of software.  On the other end, software paired with super computers and embedded systems certainly come closer to machines.<p>Overall, I these are tricky things to deal with.  I don't think that all software should be out in the open, nor do I think that every piece of software should be cloesd away.  I think the free software community needs to have a more nuanced view of the world and that having one will bear more fruit.",1273981994

Think of the people who frequent this website.  Many of them are writing lines of code to make something people want.  Surely there is some art to that.  There needs to be an idea, building something to show customers, and iteration on that idea taking customer response into account.  The customers have input, but the programmer decides what to write.<p>Just as wealthy people once commissioned portraits and told the artist what to draw, programmers can be employed someplace where the question of what to program is decided by someone else.

I won't use anything that requires proprietary file formats. I use a proprietary text editor, but only because it offers a familiar vi-mode interface. I do a brief mental audit every few months - If I expect it to take more than a day to migrate to a fully-open environment, I know I've ceded too much control to software companies.<p>I think Stallman is a fundamentalist, but an important one. I think he prompts debate and exemplifies practice in a way that is only possible because he simply will not touch proprietary software. Seth Godin recently argued that one of the most underrated properties of the internet is its ability to show us the limits of what is possible and in that sense Stallman is vital. I see him as a figure like Heston Blumenthal or Ray Jardine - there aren't many people with a sous-vide setup in their kitchen or hiking the Appalachian Trail with an eight pound pack, but their example broadens all our horizons.",1273981531

Quite apart from the question of the definition of monogamous (sexual contact with only one person in a lifetime? serial monogamy? some cheating? etc.), I suggest the following analogy: A man joins the Ku Klux Klan. He is not violent, and would never hurt a fly; he just wants a safe place to express his racist feelings. Is he culpable for the Klan's past acts of violence? I believe that even though he is not criminally responsible for acts that occurred before he joined, he is morally culpable for joining the Klan. The Klan has blood on its hands, and anyone who joins must share the guilt. So, too, with the homosexual movement.”</i>",1273981516

Thanks to pg for that! Forums such as these are not as common in the rest of the world as one could naively believe. But to bring this back to dublinclontarf 's original comment, I will write my last words on the subject.<p>As we are becoming more and more dependent on this thing called the internet, we must begin to create and offer the same types of securities, rights of access, usage and opportunities to the world, equally. Under the guidelines of free trade, like the WTO, we should have these already in place in some areas As online businesses are businesses, none the less, they should be given their due protection.<p>By restricting internet businesses from others and controlling what can and cannot be said on them is wrong. As China grows to become more powerful and has more ability to control their internet, I can only see a darker future for the state of freedom in China.<p>What we see now, are only examples of the type of governing and leadership in the CCP today. Human rights, free speech, social stability and environmental well-being all grow from the same tree. That tree looks to be quite unhealthy.<p>Bottom line, you do not have the freedom to discuss what you like on the internet in China. Period. Do so and you risk anything from losing a business license or police harassment to imprisonment or worse, in extreme cases. You do not have complete access to the online businesses being created daily across the globe. These are facts.<p>These freedoms that we take for granted in the US (I am an American) come from a basis of law and order. As I said before it is not perfect. Nothing humans create is. But from that law, we have much prosperity. the clean air comes from regulations and restrictions on wanton over-development, national parks have come from the common man fighting big business to protect something pure. By the way, even our president had to use his constitutional power to save one of the world's most precious gifts, the Grand Canyon, from the might of big business. And millions of immigrants have found a home to raise their families and prosper in their own unique ways.<p>Governments that oppress these freedoms and deny those rights have never fully grown to become world powers and beacons of hope. They made money and won some wars, but were never considered safe havens.<p>The problems associated with Internet and Freedom in China are merely symptoms of larger issues looming on the horizon.

In quantum physics, you've got 4 fundamental forces, a handful of elementary particles, and together they explain all of the universe.  In medicine, you've got a bunch of organs hooked up to the circulatory/lymphatic/nervous systems, and they make the body go 'round.  In molecular biology, you've got 4 bases of DNA and they explain basically everything.<p>The problem comes from the complex interactions between those elements.  You can learn how the body works in high school biology, but that doesn't prepare you to operate on it.  Similarly, you can learn how software is constructed (""make sure the right lines of code are used, follow each other, and are debugged properly"") from Hacker News, but that doesn't prepare you to actually put those lines of code together.<p>One of the unfortunate effects of Internet forums is that it seems to have shifted attention from the nitty-gritty details of <i>how</i> to do something to the high-level overview of how to do <i>something</i>.  So we have a bunch of programming forums where we talk <i>about</i> programming, but never actually program anything.  It's not just programming (just look at reddit.com/r/economics), but programming seems to have been one of the most affected disciplines.
