I mean, if with the same number of LOC, Gzipped size is different, that means one program is more repetitive than the other, right?

1318604,comment,1317381,1317907,0,0,jerf,,,"""I'm not convinced this explanation-by-analogy style is really all that helpful, particularly with regards to ""the big bang is an expanding balloon"". What makes it such a confusing analogy is that most people were already picturing something like an expanding sphere anyway, just one filled uniformly with matter moving away from a central point as it expands. And it doesn't reinforce that the Universe has no center, since most people can easily imagine what the center of a balloon is.""<p>The key to the balloon analogy is that it <i>only</i> applies to the <i>surface</i>. The interior of the balloon is to be ignored. You say you can easily find the center of the balloon, so I think you don't get this, because I suspect your ""center"" is the 3D center of the balloon. But that doesn't exist. Only the surface does. What's the central surface point of a sphere? There isn't one. That's the universe, only the surface is 3D, not 2D.<p>I'm fairly sure that even a large number of people using the ""expanding ballon"" metaphor don't get that, let alone the poor readers. I tend to be surprised when I see it explained correctly.<p>Also, in the classic picture of the wormhole, like you might find here: <a href=""http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/schwm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/schwm.html</a> , the wormhole is <i>not</i> the tunnel itself. If you see someone drawing an arrow that goes down the middle of the tunnel as the path of travel, they don't know what they are talking about. (That's the best picture I could find quickly, they're actually showing something else with that arrow, so I do not accuse them.) The wormhole is the <i>sides</i>; the image is two 2D chunks of space being connected through a 3rd dimension. (Incidentally you can tell Hollywood doesn't know either, because they <i>always</i> actually ""draw"" the wormhole.) The curvature of the 2D planes corresponds to gravity in these displays.<p>This is also true of the classic ""rubber sheet"" gravity analogy; the rubber sheet applies only to 2D, and the 3D ""things"" usually drawn should be understood to be merely labels explaining where the curvature comes from. You really shouldn't see a ""rolling ball"" <i>on</i> the surface, you should see it <i>in</i> the surface. Again, this is done incorrectly far more often than it is done correctly.",1272992364

This sounds to me like a general abstraction problem more than an issue with syntactic abstraction... and really, it seems like a problem with understanding how someone chose to abstract things.  They want to look underneath the hood for answers.<p>(2) They suggest that new developers will have a hard time understanding and adding to the system.  But new developers for any project have to learn the local language anyway.  It may look like C++, python, or whatever, but it the framework other developers developed always has its own learning curve.<p>Surely syntactic abstraction is just another abstraction tool that can be used to help make those frameworks easier to dive into.

Over time most of lisps features (generic functions, garbage collection) have been ported over to other languages save two - syntactic abstraction and metaobject protocols. On syntactic abstraction there seems to be genuine difference in opinion between lisp (scheme) and other languages. Lisp is on the side of allowing programmers to invent their own syntactic abstractions hence making their programs shorter and at times more understandable. Other languages have largely been unwilling to make that leap of faith because syntactic abstractions dont scale up with the number of programmers. They also make it harder to reason about the correctness of programs and make tools like profilers, debuggers, code steppers. So this continues to remain a genuine point of difference which means the lisp programs will continue to have the whizbang sleek look which other languages will find hard to emulate. On the other hands lisp programmers will continue to look in envy at the development tools of other ""less featureful"" languages.",1272990210

Maybe those too young to remember the advances made from IE4 through IE6, those may not understand how Microsoft set up how you and I use the web today. You seem to be missing the point. It's not Microsoft's job to make GMail work on your phone or linux; _however_, Microsoft's pushing the buck (even if proprietary) did push the browser market forward leaps and bounds. GMail hinges heavily on a little technology we know as XMLHTTP. Take a guess who championed the tech; take a guess how long before standards zealots published a specification draft. (MS '99; W3C '06)<p>Redmond has been sleeping, no doubt. But that is neither here nor there. It's refreshing to see other browser teams giving the IE team a run for their money and whipping them into shape -- they've been needing that for almost 10 years, finally getting them off their laurels. Competition is the best part of the space, and that should include innovative APIs (not yet standard) that us engineers can exploit to make our applications better, faster, or stronger. I'm certainly not going to wait for some standards committee to deliberate for 8 years over some monolithic spec that every browser will get wrong anyhow, as history has shown.",1272990049

Yosefk, like many C++ detractors, very clearly does not understand the rationale for a number of C++ features.  But this isn't the place for me to spend hours refuting a link that too you mere seconds to dig up.<p><i>See, when you don't need to do low-level stuff, many programming languages are vastly simpler, safer, more terse, and more flexible than C++.</i><p>That's not actually the case, though.  For a lot of simple (e.g., scripting) tasks, writing them in C++ results in a program a few small lines longer and orders of magnitude faster.  In one case I had billions of integers on which I needed to calculate some simple satistics; while the Python program was running, I was able to write, compile, and run to completion a C++ version that was a mere four lines longer (mostly empty-brace lines).<p>Some more complex tasks are actually easier in C++ than in other languages.  I had to write a parser and virtual machine for an assembly language in college.  Doing the bit-level operations in Python would have been a pain, in large part due to the automatic promotion of integers to longs; doing them in C++ was simple and preserved the semantics that I required.  I didn't need to manage any low-level allocation in that program; all my ""new"" calls went straight into smart pointers (auto_ptr actually worked fine in my situation and didn't require a non-standard library) and they handled all deallocation.  Valgrind confirmed that there were no memory leaks, with no effort at all on my part.<p>The vast majority of people who consider C++ difficult to write are unaware (commonly through willful ignorance) of how to write C++ for this the frequently cited issues never arise in the first place.<p><i>And you can learn them in no time (you were able to learn C++, after all).</i><p>It's not a matter of learning other languages; I'm competent in Python, OCaml, Perl, and a number of other languages I've worked with over the years.  C++ is actually a rather late addition to my bevy of languages.<p><i>So, in that case, C++ isn't the best option. Why bother with it?</i><p>Just because I can learn other languages doesn't mean C++ isn't the best option.  Sure, I could similar speed in OCaml, but then I'd be the only one who could work on it, and my employer would be in a tight spot if I were hit by a bus.  I could write it in Python or Perl a little bit faster, but it would be an order of magnitude slower, and I'd have to throw tons more hardware at the problem to process the same amount of data.<p><i>Object Orientation for instance, is a mistake.</i><p>Ah.  I see now that I'm arguing with an ideologue.  Good day.",1272988858

Most people don't really enjoy/understand the concepts that much (or disagree with their use), and categorize it as crack (typically short fanfiction that contains amusing or interesting concept but lacks the depth or structure to qualify as being good fiction).",1272988846

Those things don't work like cells, they add the duplication at the highest layer possible. It's not something pervasively shot through the entire architecture, all the way down to the simplest primitives, like it is in biology. Those systems run the same code on what may very well be the same basic hardware, code that still has the same basic structure of core primitives and higher layers and can still crash like a program can. They are slightly more robust against some types of errors, but are still not even remotely like a cell.",1272988815
