1392125,comment,1391208,1392113,0,0,ErrantX,,,"That sounds exactly like the sort of degree I mean. It's not all that common though, in my experience, to find a CS degree with that sort of curriculum.<p><i>Do you just cross me off the list because I have a CS degree.</i><p>That's silly :) You may have noted from my post that I do hire CS majors.<p><i>but do they understand the inner workings of a computer? Do they understand complexity, even the basic data structures.</i><p>Yes, usually a <i>lot</i> better than most CS graduates. Because generally speaking <i>in the real world</i> these are engineering problems rather than pure problems.<p>This is just my observation, but I don't think I am wrong - CS majors are generally worse programmers (and usually more full of themselves, but that's another matter) than CS engineers.<p>I would consider you (based on your post) an engineer; as you explain, you were part of the engineering dept.<p>(that's not to say CS majors are all bad - I've met some extremely good ones. The problem is that the <i>majority</i> of CS is taught as a pure subject with a smattering of applied theory. There is a distinct lack of problem solving involved. Traditional disclaimer: YMMV)<p>Also I should point out that being an engineer does not automatically make you a great programmer. Clearly you need an interest, an amount of aptitude and the ability/willingness to learn the pure subjects (if they were not part of your degree). The last of those isn't all that important - to be a good programmer you only need the amount of pure theory that is required (and you learn to pick it up as you go) - this is a common trait of all engineering.",1275295623

It is not considered a math degree, but instead a CS degree from an engineering department.  My education was engineering focused. My degree says I am a graduate from the Engineering school.  I can write assembly, program a fpga, write OO programs, OS drivers and System calls.  Shoot, I even wrote My own file system.  I learned java and C++, in the first 2 weeks of 2 classes, and that was all the programming instruction given.  Though I had good experience in MIPS Assembly, Java, C, C++, Scheme, Lisp, ML, Haskell,Prolog, C+ and Fortress.<p>I designed my own soda machine, calculator and even designed/created a real world solution which companies were interested in, though I cant mention because it would be me not anonymous.<p>I was not a computer engineer, I was a CS student.  My school also had computer engineering, but I was not really interested in the EE stuff.<p>I took all of the Math that engineers take, and I took the Engineering Chemistry and Engineering Physics.<p>Due to my CS dept being a subset of the engineering dept, the goals were the same.  Everything was problem solving. Every class had its set of rigorous problems, which students had to succeed at or they simply would not pass.<p>I learned Algorithms, internal Operating systems, Complexity, Computation, fundamentals of Programming languages, distributed systems, organization, Computer Architecture, VSLI/HDL, etc.  Im sure you get the point.<p>I personally think I bring a good bit to the table, as do the other few graduates that survived the curriculum.<p>You very well may find a more well rounded candidate than myself from the non traditionally educated pool, but they will be few.  If you lump all CS graduates in the same pool, you are doing yourself a disservice.  While yeah, somebody from a Java school may suck.  What do you say to a candidate like myself, who really can bring what you need to the table.  Do you just cross me off the list because I have a CS degree.

Teaching ""real-world"" computer programming in school is an impossible goal. You only get the real-world experience when you are out in it. CS should prepare you for the real world, and help expose you to the real-world, but it's almost impossible to teach it. What CS does teach you is the bigger things. The bigger concepts that go beyond software engineering, or any particular project in particular. You learn how to think about big things and hard problems. CS at a university is not a prep course for your job per se. It's not a trade school. You're learning things that can be applied in the real-world but transcend the real-world. It's important to realize that there are more important things than just being able to program C# for your job.",1275294303

1392074,comment,1391695,1391695,0,0,kurumo,,,"Generally speaking, CS programs out there seem to lack both depth and breadth, be out of touch/time with ""the desert of the real"", and suffer from what Dijkstra called ""the infantilization of curriculum"". Too often do I see people who are proficient (for some value of ""proficiency"") in one (1) language, usually the wrong one. I believe that a CS program ought to introduce you to several languages, to a level where you can read and write programs of small to medium size (~1 kloc). At a minimum, in this day and age I would expect C, your least favorite mainstream language (though I personally would avoid Java, due to combination of a lack of an explicit reference type and a misguided OO fetish), something from the Lisp family (Scheme), and Javascript. Something from the ML family would be a bonus, though I would skip type theory altogether. Having been exposed to several radically different languages helps. I would ask everyone to write an interpreter for a simple language (in a language of your choice): something with variables, conditionals and function calls. A compiler for the same would be a nice next step. As projects go, this would be sufficiently involved to address Dijkstra's complaint part of the way.<p>A few people said something to the effect ""the real world  is missing"". It's true. Majority of CS programs appear to be years out of date with respect to the industry practice, whatever ""the industry"" happens to mean for you personally. To some extent this is inevitable, though we could be doing a lot more to address the issue - say, as someone suggested, via a separate course, one that is updated biannually. A course like this could and should include a discussion of things like source control tools, build tools, etc. Things like resource management idioms in languages of the day should be discussed explicitly: too often graduates of CS programs assume infinite resources or automagical cleanup, especially if they come from a background in languages that are garbage collected. A course in parallel programming presented via different languages and their approaches to parallelism would be fantastically useful; I would pay money to see it on OCW or similar.<p>Somewhat related to Dijkstra's complaint is the following concern: people are terribly bad at thinking about complexity, at all levels - from a single source file to a system composed of hundreds of separate processes. We would do well to discuss managing complexity explicitly in CS curriculum: to make people think about difficulty of maintenance, changes to a working system, rollout procedures for uptime, etc. A seminar on the subject of complexity management, from small to large scale, with examples, would be very useful.<p>Incidentally, this is something I have been thinking a lot about over the last two years, in part due to conducting a metric shitload of interviews for intro positions. There are things that my CS program was missing, and things that a majority of programs out there seem to be missing; understandably, what I can say mostly applies to the former.",1275293260
