I consider it an affront to the dignity of all children and my teeth are set on edge every time I hear it.</i><p>For outliers, statistics doesn't work that well (and feels reductive of their uniqueness.... <i>because it is!</i>). And of course this is true of everyone - we're all unique and special and statistics doesn't get to the heart of our own personal story.<p>But this isn't the point of such things - terms such as age-appropriate are really aimed only at <i>most</i> children, <i>most</i> of the time.

1357235,comment,1355977,1356798,0,0,jules,,,"Multiple or predicate dispatch object systems take the view that objects <i>are</i> structs <i>without</i> methods in them. Methods are just open conditionals: by defining a new method implementation you add a clause to the conditional.<p>e.g.<p><pre><code>    type Animal
    type Lion < Animal
    type Elephant < Animal
    type Giraffe < Animal

    method encounter(Animal, Animal)

    def encounter(Lion a, Giraffe b):
        // eat it

    def encounter(Lion a, Lion b):
        // fight
</code></pre>
Is equivalent to:<p><pre><code>    type Animal
    type Lion < Animal
    type Elephant < Animal
    type Giraffe < Animal
    
    def encounter(Animal a, Animal b):
       if(a is Lion && b is Giraffe):
          // eat it
       else if(a is Lion && b is Lion):
          // fight
       else:
          raise NoApplicableMethodError
</code></pre>
Languages with predicate dispatch usually allow you to define your own predicate classes:<p><pre><code>    def Prime(n): // primality testing algorithm here

    def Foo(Prime n): ...
</code></pre>
Or:<p><pre><code>    type Rectangle height width

    def Square(Rectangle r): height(r) == width(r)
    
    def Something(Square x): ...
    def Something(Rectangle x): ...
</code></pre>
And they allow you to add predicates to methods themselves:<p><pre><code>    def encounter(Lion a, Giraffe b) when isHungry(a): eat
    def encounter(Lion a, Giraffe b) when !isHungry(a): walk away
</code></pre>
This is much more powerful and simpler than message passing, IMO.<p>It's closely related to pattern matching in languages like Haskell, but that's usually not allowed to span multiple modules or files. And algebraic data types are closed, making it much less useful.",1274185605
