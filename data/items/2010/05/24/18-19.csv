These are business problems where companies are desperately throwing many times more money at less efficient solutions or know they are leaving huge amounts of money on the table by not having a better solution.<p>He has a few talks where he talks about some success stories that he happens to know about because he's advised them as former students.  Nobody knows how many ""under the radar"" companies like this there are, but I would bet it's far easier to make a fortune from a company that fits this profile than a Google acquisition.",1274727588
