The concept was tested on the Deep Space 1 probe with great success. IIRC, a Vasimir engine (a variation on the ion theme) will be tested on the ISS. Ion engines are pretty much off-the-shelf (or, as much off-the-shelf as deep-space probe propulsion go) now.<p>Another alternative (that still would require some work) would be a solar sail, to be deployed after the probe uses the Sun as a gravity assist.<p>You could, conceivably, use both. You would shot the probe towards the Sun with ion engine on. Ideally, it would reach escape velocity from the Sun during this first leg. When passing close to the Sun, it would deploy the solar sail and get as much impulse from that as possible - discounting the sail mass, it's essentially free. When the solar sail is spent (it's a very thin foil, degrades and becomes less efficient as it gets farther from the Sun) the probe jettisons it, turns on the ion engine again and rides it until all the propellant is spent.<p>That should give it some serious speed.<p>Mind you, speed was not Voyager's priority. Voyager 1 and 2 were great sightseeing tours of the outer solar system. The fact they still work is a testimonial of the genius of those who built them.",1273888771

However, there are aspects that take most people years to learn, due to the time it takes to release a project and see it's failings.  This is different from learning physics, philosophy, or the academic aspects of law and medicine which can be learned in a classroom setting.  However, the practical aspects of law and medicine cannot be learned without years of experience in the field.<p>So yes, to be able to start practicing software the required body of knowledge is much smaller than medicine or law -- however this is somewhat artificial.  There is monopoly control over licensing for doctors and lawyers.  If there were monopoly control over licensing for programmers, they might have to spend years in the classroom before practicing as well.  I believe that apprentices could start practicing medicine and law much earlier in their careers and learn the facts they need along the way.  This would be a lot more affordable for students, but it would lower the wages of lawyers and doctors, so it's probably not going to happen.",1273887516

My idea for the app is to be a bare basics accounting system for freelancers, micro-isvs, and small businesses. I'm a one-man startup registered as a sole proprietorship. I am required to submit annually my financial statements (Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement) along with my tax return. What I need is a simple and basic app that can generate the three basic financial statements (if PDF or Excel format). From what I've read, these are the most important financial statements to any business. So my idea is an online app that does simple and easy bookkeeping and can generate the three financial statements. No invoicing, no proposals, no accessing my bank account, and so on. I looked at Xero and Less Accounting, they're not simple and basic enough for my needs. So I'm thinking of scratching my own itch. I was just wondering if others have this itch too.

And it’s why they’re using fake names ....<p>Well, I'm glad they're concerned. However, there's getting it, and then there's getting it.<p>I'm definitely on the adult end of things (I'm 44). I tended to use made-up names in net discussions until relatively recently. But I consistently found myself tempted to make comments that I would not want my real identity to be associated with. So, when I got my HN account in early '09, I used an abbreviation of my real name, as a reminder to myself that I shouldn't say anything I would not want to be associated with (and also that there is a good chance that even ""anonymous"" comments could be traced to the real me someday).<p>And that seems to me (in my arrogance?) to be a rather deeper level of ""getting it"" than that attained by many of the above-mentioned youth using fake names.<p>> Over and over again, I find that people’s mental model of who can see what doesn’t match up with reality.<p>Definitely. And this is not a new phenomenon at all. I remember reading the Usenet group misc.kids back in the 90s, and being shocked at all the personal details of children's lives that some parents were posting, often under apparently real names. The newsgroup was being treated as a neighborhood mothers gossip group, not as something that the whole world could see, and that would be archived forever.<p>EDIT. And a third passage:<p>> The battle that is underway is not a battle over the future of privacy and publicity. It’s a battle over choice and informed consent.<p>An excellent point, and one that needs to be made more often. Despite what the article says, the statement ""young people don't care about privacy"" might indeed be true, in general. However, even if it is, that does not mean it is okay to make privacy-related decisions for them. And it certainly does not mean it is okay to invade their privacy by means of trickery and deceit.",1273886706

The government has significantly more recourse than AT&T does. Whatever a commercial says or doesn't say, whatever you may think about it, if you owe taxes, you're going to end up paying them. If you've never been in tax trouble before, know that the states are much meaner than the IRS --- pay them first.",1273885715
1349090,comment,1348834,1348918,0,0,davidcuddeback,,,"I was just thinking about this last night, because I've noticed that when I spend all day involved in an intellectual task (could be writing code; yesterday it happened to be writing my thesis), I'm less entertaining to my girlfriend when we talk on the phone.  When I was thinking about it last night, I guessed that the reason was because I hadn't done anything during the day worth sharing.  Whereas if I do something interesting then I'm more likely to have an experience worth sharing with her.<p>This seems to make more sense to me.  For instance, when I made a discovery and when I got accepted to a conference, I had something exciting to tell her.  Even though I may be engaged in intellectual activity all day, I might have no problem switching gears to telling her good news and talking about travel plans for the conference.<p>But perhaps that's different than the dating scenario in the article because of my comfort level with my girlfriend.  Socializing with more-or-less strangers is a completely different state of mind, as shiny said, than talking to someone close to you.<p>I think there could be merit to both ideas.  I'll take note of it tonight, since I'm going to be going to a beer tasting in a couple hours after I've been engaged in my thesis all day.",1273885528
