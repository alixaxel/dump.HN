ZFS on FUSE reads almost as fast and lacks in write speed, which is reasonable---it's not optimised in the slightest and ZFS has a reputation for being somewhat slow even on Solaris, where it is native. Not too shabby, I think. (It's a benchmark, though. Your mileage may vary.)<p>1: <a href=""http://www.csamuel.org/2007/04/25/comparing-ntfs-3g-to-zfs-fuse-for-fuse-performance/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csamuel.org/2007/04/25/comparing-ntfs-3g-to-zfs-f...</a>",1275019165

But I am going to disagree with the notion of going on your own and just investing in index funds.<p>It's not as easy as it sounds to stay consistent with it over time (years, decades).   I did all the research, read a bunch of books, and used up a lot of my time when I was looking into investing.  I picked an asset allocation strategy, and planned to contribute regularly and rebalance annually.<p>That just didn't happen.  Rebalancing annually didn't.  Contributing in a timely fashion didn't.  My income goes up and down, I have to pay quarterly estimates, so I do keep some degree of excess cash.  invariably, I forget to invest the difference for long periods of time.<p>In the end I hired a financial person to just handle it and manage my money.  Yes, there is a drag on returns because of it.  But the alternative was being out of the market for periods of time, or off balance. Anyway, just another opinion.",1275019102

I suggest you challenge yourself to figure out what is the next step you need help with and figure it out yourself.  Unless you are looking at some very unique problem solving chances are you can do this.<p>Funny story: when I started coding my web app that supports myself and my family I had never created a database or re-usable objects.  I ended up with huge pages of procedural PHP code and a primitive denormalized database, because I didn't really know any better.  I've managed to scale this old code across two servers, and while it's pretty horrid, making changes and troubleshooting is a breeze because it's all mine.",1275016642

So here's a suggestion:<p>1. Take 20,000, and hire 4 developers for 5,000 each for, say, a few weeks of work. Have them build the SAME product. At the end of the few weeks, evaluate who you like better. There will be likely someone who stands out. Hire them.<p>2. Take 40,000, and build the product. Launch it. Keep removing features until you can build it for this amount.<p>3. Now after (and only after) you've launched, take customer feedback, and spend the next 40,000 finetuning the product.<p>There are of course also other ways to go about this :)",1275016298
