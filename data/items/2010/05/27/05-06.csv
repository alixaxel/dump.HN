Michael removed a lot of magic that I never understood. But I suppose my worries are irreconcilable: Michael attempts to please both programmers and non-programmers at the same time.<p>For example, I enjoyed things such as Figure 2.11 (a detailed explanation of MVC in Rails), but then Michael flashes through Ruby in Chapter 4. I understood it because I'm a programmer, but I don't know if any of the other target audiences would.<p>And as the tutorial progressed, I felt that Michael explained concepts and topics less and less.<p>For example, for user sign-in/out, another Rails book simply insert a session[:user_id] = @user.id, but Michael goes through the trouble of creating a new User.remeber_token field (Chapter 9). Why?<p>Security? Surely not, since he previously explained that cookies are checksumed to make sure that it was not tampered with on the client side. Efficiency? Nope. The session[:user_id] = @user.id is more efficient.<p>Then there are also other quirks such as modifying the Users table everytime the user logs in (it calls User.remember_me!). (I might be wrong about this, please check me).<p>I started this tutorial to remove some magic fairy dust from my eyes, but I'm afraid it has blinded me even more.<p>Michael, I'd really appreciate it if you could answer some of my questions.<p>NOTE: I've played around w/ RoR before, but not much.",1274939578

Of all the languages that are serious candidates, most reasonable people would agree it's already the closest thing we have to a global standard language, especially in science, business and programming. Also, you can have and preserve culture even when a people's default language changes. I also would argue that there is nothing inherently special in ""culture"" which is distinct from it's component elements -- much of it is random and arbitrary and due to different choices and evolutionary paths caused by geographic, racial and tribal/breeding differences. I'd argue that much of what we now consider to be national culture will blur together and fade away over a long enough period of time. And the pace has likely accelerated due to modern travel and communication technology (eg. jet airliners and the Internet). I also think it would be a net-win eventually if all nations merged together into a single nation -- among other things, it would eliminate or at least drastically reduce the need or justification for large standing armies and the military-industrial complex. US wouldn't need to make another country a boogeyman (USSR/China/Iraq/Iran/etc.) and vice versa.
