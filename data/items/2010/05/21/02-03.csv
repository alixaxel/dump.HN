Yes, it's not nice to unfairly antagonize people.

I've walked past police with machine guns in airports and that doesn't cross me nearly as unnerving as having to give my finger prints.<p>It's not that I'm worried for anything I've done, I have had police checks performed (twice from the UK) and I come up clean because I've never had a problem with the police and I've never committed a crime. What worries me is that our governments have data sharing policies, as soon as I'm finger printed entering the US I have little doubt that they've been entered into a database back in the UK as well.<p>I dislike the thought that someone will be capable of checking up on me behind my back. I can understand why the US would want it, even if it seems exceptionally barbaric, but it's that the UK and possibly Canadian or other governments will be checking up on if my fingerprints have appeared anywhere. Precisely because after the Madrid bombings an Oregon based lawyer was arrested on an 'incontrovertible match' by the FBI based on prints lifted and arrested him, however completely ignored the fact (for two weeks!) that he hadn't left the country - he matched because he was an Islamic convert and his wife was Egyptian born, his fingerprint never matched at all.<p>My figuring is that the longer my fingerprints stay out of any national or international registry, the less chance I have of being hassled during my lifetime because of a government screw up with the data.",1274409307

Mandriva is popular in Europe. In my experience, they are almost identical in terms of running proprietary software. Arch is also popular, but due to its source-based nature is mostly for more techy users -- they probably won't mind a bit of work if your software doesn't work out of the box.<p>There's a decent list on < <a href=""http://distrowatch.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://distrowatch.com/</a> >, sorted by popularity, in right sidebar.<p><pre><code>  Thirdly, how do we select distros/versions/etc without 1) the userbase crying foul for lack of support for their config; and 2) without subdividing an already small market for games?\n</code></pre>\nUse the most recent (or most and second-most, if you've got free time). The market is small, but there's different levels of small; most Linux gamers are going to be close to the bleeding edge, to take advantage of driver improvements.<p>If you're in doubt, run a poll -- ask which distro, version, and graphics card vendor your customers use. Publish the results. This will serve the dual purpose of 1) letting you know what to support and 2) giving users an idea of what configurations are best tested.<p><pre><code>  And our experience is that Linux users are not more forgiving when the app in question has been paid for. Expectations are low when something is free but high when something is not. So we need that work to be justified.\n</code></pre>\nSome users are never forgiving, whether they're in the right or not. However, potential customers will be influenced by how reasonable other user's complaints are. ""I use Ubuntu 10.04 and your game crashes on startup"" is a legitimate complaint; ""I run a four-year old Slackware install, and audio doesn't work because I replaced ALSA with OSSv4"" will just be ignored as a crank.",1274408190
