1340123,comment,1339053,1339538,0,0,celoyd,,,"As you suggest, this is going to be a matter of personal taste. But to me, naming software after an oppressed people is <i>prima facie</i> gross. That kind of homage is patronizing by default. We don’t have a Jew filesystem or a Tutsi browser, however flattering they might be the minds of the founders.<p>I think it’s mostly irrelevant that Gimp is an acronym. As an extreme case, if the initials of my descriptively named project happen to spell the N-word, people would be right to question my taste if I ran with it. Obviously “Apache” is not the same as the N-word, but you can see the point. It doesn’t matter if the connotations in my mind are only wholesome: I’m assigning to symbols that are already bound in outer contexts, and that’s dangerous in human culture.<p>I’m not trying to be the political correctness police here. It’s not my job to get angry on other people’s behalf – I’m not Apache or physically disabled. But I would think very hard before calling a project anything like Apache or Gimp, and to me they seem at least as bad as Diaspora.<p>Anyway, I do see how a reasonable person could hold your position.",1273636606

Hydrostatic pressure is essentially only a function of depth: P = rho.g.h. Think about the design of a damn, it needs to be much thicker at the bottom due to higher pressures. You can experiment (or thought experiment) with two cups of water and a tube on the same level. Fill one cup and fill the tube.

The example I'm thinking of is losing your network connection while typing an e-mail in GMail.  It shows a warning message, but out of the way so you might not notice.  If you intentionally take an action to save, you are more likely to notice the result (and a good user interface would make a failed intentional save obvious by a popup message or something).<p><i>You made a change - that's it.
