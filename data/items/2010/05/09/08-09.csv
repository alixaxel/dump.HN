Allen, a biologist at Oklahoma State University, argued that a smart-enough species could develop a quantum computer and eventually transfer their consciousnesses into it.<p>""No more inefficient metabolism requiring huge energy input, no chemically derived bodies to wear out, no reproduction, no death, no taxes. Just supermassively parallel collective consciousness with unlimited capabilities,"" he wrote. ""Perhaps, through super symmetry or entanglement, they can ""see"" or ""feel"" the entire universe. Maybe, they've gained the ability to manipulate elementary particles and can control its evolution and its fate. They would have become, by any human definition, Gods.""",1273394824

1331731,comment,1331591,1331591,0,0,10ren,,,"A great read.<p>One thing troubles me is that ""great businesses"" that make more money for their owners and raise prices for customers, seem to be less <i>socially useful</i> than the others, such as those in the airplane industry.<p>Here's the arithmetic for the 15% pa business, paying 35% tax, annually vs. after 30 years:<p><pre><code>    1.15   ** 30 = 66.2117720;   * .65 = 43.0376518\n    1.0975 ** 30 = 16.2980583\n</code></pre>\nBTW: My Buffett-based investment approach is to get the total stockholder equity from a while ago (eg. a decade) and now, and calculate its annual growth rate [1], a kind of $-acceleration. Then qualitatively understand what makes the business profitable, and consider whether those factors are likely to continue for <i>x</i> years. Finally, use the growth rate to project <i>x</i> years into the future, and compare with investing in an index fund; but normalize by today's price of the stock (ie you usually pay more than $1 for $1 of shareholder equity). You can see how long it will take before the stock outperforms the index. If it does, with a margin of safety, buy it.<p>[1] It doesn't account for dividends, and includes valuations of IP and goodwill (which are opinions, not cash), and I'm sure has other flaws. It's crude, but accurate enough if you use a margin of safety; I tend to think more precision is spurious and misleading, like those 7 decimal places above.<p>Does it work? I've looked at about 10 likely companies, but only one looked really good (30% pa growth rate, and an artificially low price due to bad news). After 5 years, my return today is 212.20%, ie it's worth over 3 times what I paid (and that's ignoring its dividends). Theoretically, it would be 1.3 * * 5 = 4.7, but I paid more than $1 for $1 of equity; the growth rate subsequently dropped to 25% (which is still fantastic!), and the current market is a bit low. So, the margin of safety is important.",1273393141

I'd love to see a better test of this, though.</i><p>That’s very much what I would expect. You generally disagree with someone because you think they have poor arguments – how could something that is, say, factually wrong or not coherent also be insightful? I always cringe when people here say you shouldn’t downvote when you disagree. Should you really not downvote if a comment contains obvious factual errors or if the arguments obviously make no sense? (I have to add, though, that the “obvious” is important here. I think you shouldn’t downvote when someone made reasonable errors in their argument.)<p>I think there are cases where comments you disagree with can be insightful (when, say, a aspect of a problem is shown that you didn’t consider before) but I would also argue that those instances are rather rare.",1273392374
