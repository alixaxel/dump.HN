Although he presents the air of a ""great programmer"", it's actually because his architectural abilities are absent. Given a small project, he'll do a good job of it-- and very fast, since he doesn't care about things like unit testing. Given a large one, he'll make a mess that even he can barely sort out. I can see how, in some environments, he'd look like a hero for being able to tackle supposedly complex problems (although it's his terrible coding habits that make such problems seem so complicated).<p>I hate hate hate ""rockstar"" programmers (and, yes, the Kefka-style ""hate hate hate"" is appropriate).<p>I also think there's an inherent mismatch between management and technical people regarding how to present the difficulty of one's work.

They have also filed Trademark infringements and other stuff against them at the same time (no comment on the general legitimacy of such claims for the moment).<p>I haven't fully digested all the information to have a complete opinion on this but... I think that this is part of Facebook trying to win the wider battle with Power.com, I'm not sure it reflects a deliberate move by them to try and turn ToS violations into criminal violations. However I am definitely in agreement with the EFF that if a potential side effect of any eventual ruling will bring in such criminal elements then it is a bad thing and should be fought.

It promises general, powerful, and fast machine learning, moving us one step closer to AI.<p>An algorithm is deep if the input is passed through several non-linearities before being output. Most modern learning algorithms (including decision trees and SVMs and naive bayes) are ""shallow"".<p>For intuition, imagine if I told you that your main routine can call subroutines, and your subroutines could call subsubroutines, but you couldn't have any more abstraction than that. You can't have subsubsubroutines in your ""shallow"" program. You could compute whatever you wanted in a ""shallow"" program, but your code would involve a lot of duplicated code and would not be as compact as it should be. Similarly, a shallow machine learning architecture would involve a lot of duplication of effort to express things that a deep architecture could more compactly. The point being, a deep architecture can more gracefully reuse previous computations.<p>Deep learning is motivated by intuition, theoretical arguments from circuit theory, empirical results, and current knowledge of neuroscience. Here is a video where I give a high-level talk on deep learning, and describe this intuition:

1319339,comment,1319174,1319174,0,0,kgermino,,,"I have long felt that anti-gouging laws are misguided fix to a problem.  The best example I have heard is a story of three college kids who lived outside the strike-zone of a tornado.  They rented a refrigerator truck, and some chainsaws then filled the truck with bags of ice.  Because the roads were in such bad shape, and they had to keep cutting down trees that were in their way it took the group the better part of a day to make it into the town center.  However once they got there they started selling the bags of ice for about double what ice would normally cost.<p>As more and more people heard about the ice a long line formed in front of the truck.  As the story was described to me most people would get to the front of the line and when they heard the price the people would complain that the students were gouging but still ask for 3-4 bags of ice.  Eventually the town's police came, locked the truck and arrested the students for price-gouging.<p>All this did was prevent the people who were waiting for the ice to not be able to get any at all.  Additionally since people, even people who complained about the high price, still bought multiple bags it was obviously worth buying to them at that price, and as more people outside realized they could make money they would be more likely to bring in even more ice, reducing the shortage.  Contrarily if the students knew that they would only be able to charge the normal price for a bag of ice they would never have bought any and the shortage would have been worse.  If your mother needed ice for her Diabetes meds wouldn't you rather pay $8 for a bag of ice than not be able to get any at any price?<p>Incidentally this story came from an episode of Russ Robert's Podcast EconTalk www.econtalk.org that was released about a year and one half ago.  If anyone wants to know more specifically I can check just ask, but regardless if economics interests you I highly recommend the podcast.<p>TL;DR: ""price gouging"" is actually an effective way to help alleviate shortages, especially in disaster zones where there is little or none of a necessity such as ice, available.",1273007434

People line up to buy them because all the stores are sold out. Police arrest the man and confiscate the generators. This guy was doing his 19 potential customers a gigantic service and only wanted 100% return on investment, he probably could have sold them for more than that, but instead NO ONE gets a generator. Absolutely asinine, the guy is a hero not a criminal.",1273006855

If he wasn't writing software, it seems like he would probably sell, paint, drive (or any other ""career"") himself to death, right? I wouldn't encourage it either, but it's probably just who he is.<p>It seems like these type of careers just draw that type of driven person.
