More important is the case of private data that are gathered by having a user enter their credentials. Using the private data in a way to which the user expressly agrees, regardless of TOS, should be legal. The problem arises when the data are used in a way counter to the user's wishes: like pretending to offer social network aggregation and instead publishing it without consent. That should probably be illegal.<p>I agree that it's not so clear-cut. Like a lot of legal matters, intent is also relevant, in addition to the actual effect.",1273006766

Only users make downloadlinks public, not Rapidshare. (Is that true, by the way? Is the only way to search Rapidshare to search for published links somewhere on the internet?) Giving the user the option of publishing the downloadlink cannot be prohibited. (I would guess because such a feature can have legitimate uses.)",1273006756

1319288,comment,1318916,1318916,0,0,agentultra,,,"Are programmers freaking lemmings or something?<p>We're people, damnit. We choose to work overtime for various reasons. Some of which include: putting dinner on the table, keeping our jobs, getting our foot in the door, and so forth.<p>In my experience there are only 3 cases for working overtime:<p>1. You're a new, mediocre, or terrible programmer. You've been given three months to deliver a web site using a framework that practically holds your hand and wipes your ass and yet you still need more time. Everything seems hard. There's nothing you can do but brute-force your way to the finish line: stay up late and work that overtime to get it done and make up for all the time wasted googling, procrastinating, and debugging with a shotgun.<p>2. The suits messed up. They set a deadline without consulting you. They took on a contract with an incredibly short deadline because the business needs the money. They forgot to plan ahead for the big industry conference and they need something to show off to the other suits that will be there.<p>3. You've entered a culture of slavery. You just got your foot in the door at a big company. Unfortunately things have been sliding downhill and they never told you just how bad it has gotten during the interview process. Some people who stick to their guns will run for the hills, but you've got bigger responsibilities and cannot afford to take another month off job-searching. If you don't join in, they'll just make you look bad and the suits will fire you.<p>For me it's simple: if I can't get it done in 8 hours a day, someone didn't consult me for an estimate and its their fault. I may choose to work the overtime to get it done, but it's not something I personally tolerate. I value my life more than my work and my free time is important. But sometimes you have to do what you have to do to put a roof over your family's head and dinner on the table.<p>It's not as stupid as, ""programmers love working overtime because they're passionate people!""<p>I'm passionate about what I do. But I'm passionate about life. Programming is a part of that. Slaving away to make some other dude rich isn't.",1273006536

I think it's pretty ludicrous to think they'd do that:  their sales of the iPad are directly, heavily affected by perceived performance of the device.  If it's slow, people won't buy it.<p>How many extra apps do you think that move would make people buy:  2?  5?  So you think they'd cripple performance and lose hundreds of thousands of sales so that they can get people to spend an extra $20 or so at the app store, of which they'll get all of $6?  If they wanted your extra $6 that badly they'd just up the price on the device.<p>I just don't understand this constant assumption that every decision Apple makes is anti-competitive and designed to achieve lockin.  Isn't it way more rational to assume that they want to make the device as good as possible because they make money by selling devices, and that their decisions are primarily driven by that motive?",1273006253

1319270,comment,1319188,1319188,0,0,mrkurt,,,"I found this sort of interesting, mostly because it's written from a different angle than I usually think about health care.  For instance:<p>> I'd rather optimize for the common case (random doctor visits) than for the edge case (major medical emergency).<p>In my case, I'd prefer to let health insurance work as insurance and have another tool to pay for routine medical care.  The plan they opted out of is meant to be paired with an HSA, which is a pretax fund that pays for medical services.  It also <i>goes with you</i> when you leave a company/insurance provider.  I don't know what the cost difference was between the HSA compatible plan and the one they went with, but I'd like to!<p>My ideal employer would pay for a high deductible health plan and and fund as much of an HSA as they could each year.  This is a better deal for me (and I suspect many people here).  It allows me to make more nuanced decisions about how my benefits are allocated.  If I have a cold, but it's not quite bad enough that it's worth the $80 or whatever out of my ""retirement account"" to pay for it, I'd rather have the $80.  Similarly, if I injure my knee, rather than paying the $800 for an MRI I might choose to put it off and try other things (that one I've done, it worked out well!).<p>Health is one of those things that a health care plan isn't very good at maximizing, which is why it seems odd that companies/employees treat plans this way.  The best possible things people can do for their health are: eat healthy and maintain an active lifestyle.  Besides that, early detection of giant problems is a huge deal.  Standard health plans don't really do any of that, unfortunately.  Companies that want more healthy employees should address those things specifically, I think.  Sadly, they're some of the first benefits to go (as I sit here sobbing about a 50% cut in my health club allowance for 2010).",1273006216
1319269,comment,1319092,1319092,0,0,scott_s,,,"While C++0x will have proper lamdbas and closures (I've said this how many times in the past few weeks?), I think it's worth noting the ""proper"" way to emulate a closure in C++ is with a function object. Example:<p><pre><code>  struct Summation {
    int& sum;
    Summation(int& s): sum(s) {}
    void operator()(int n)
    {
      sum += n;
    }
  };

  vector<int> numbers;
  int sum = 0;
  // give numbers some interesting values
  for_each(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), Summation(sum));
  cout << ""sum of all numbers: "" << sum << endl;
</code></pre>
C++0x lambdas will generate code very similar to this. The need to explicitly define a named struct/class and function object is an obvious weakness of this technique.<p>Although I do agree with his overall point, which is that the need to use iterators for all sequences is a code smell.

I think that'd be Sendmail 8.6.12 and 8lgm's syslog(3) overflow exploit.<p>For the first half of the 1990s, Sendmail was to Internet security what Wordpress is now: the dominant attack vector. Sendmail zero days were the bearer bonds of #hack. Whenever Allman's team fixed a flaw, the current version of Sendmail became one of the hottest targets on the net. 8lgm had been coming off a string of something like 12 high-quality advisories. An unpublished 8lgm advisory in 8.6.12 was a big deal indeed.<p>8lgm basically dared the Internet to reproduce their finding; they said ""it's an overflow in vasprintf in syslog, but we're not showing the exploit"". For the next 8 months or so, everyone was madly trying to cobble together stack overflow exploits. I remember sitting in someone's apartment at a party watching Mudge walk us through some example shellcode. I started Matasano with one of the guys who published the first x86 stack overflow.<p>My point is, well before Smashing the Stack, buffer overflows were a <i>very</i> big deal.<p>Let me head off a likely follow-on argument: there's no ""Smashing the Stack""-a-like for heap overflow exploits; the techniques to exploit heap overflows are as folkloric as stack overflows were prior to Elias' article. That is to say, it's out there, it's not hard to find (especially if you can read and play with exploit code), but there's no solid cookbook. And yet there's a thriving ecology of heap exploits out there. So it's hard to argue that the '90s would have played out that differently without Elias' article.<p>This does nothing to answer the core question: why so many years between rtm's worm and Lopatic's HTTPD exploit?",1273005936
