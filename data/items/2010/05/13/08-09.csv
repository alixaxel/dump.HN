1343703,comment,1343517,1343517,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"It's really frustrating the way these huge bills get created. You might have 20% good ideas, 20% toss-outs to the PACs that elected you, 20% earmarks, 20% total crap, and 20% unknown.<p>Is a bill like that worth voting for? You can pitch it as solving a huge problem, being an indication of rampant corruption, making progress in a key social or political movement, being a vehicle for bringing money to your state, or being a terrible mistake. Fact is, it could be all of these. Then congressmen can use legislative tricks to both vote for and against the same bill, effectively rendering any kind of simple debate meaningless. Which is the exact reason why it's constructed the way it is.<p>I think in terms of startups, this is the worst bill I've seen in years. And while I'm sure professional Angel organizations are all on top of the changes and such, we need to be moving in the exact opposite direction than this bill is taking us. I think real reform is needed, but I am deeply worried that the underlying theory here -- that market risk can be managed by committee or legislation -- is deeply flawed. Adding to that structural problem I have is all of these other really bad tack-ons, like giving the FDA more control over the vitamin and supplement business.<p>Bad. Bad. Bad.",1273741096

LA is world-famous for its urban sprawl and car culture! And in the Bay Area, you can drive from Millbrae to Gilroy while going through nothing but endless suburbs for 65 miles. Meanwhile, Portland has super-restrictive growth and zoning policies, and is much cheaper. So I think there are more factors at work.",1273740471

Some is direct: military, police, court, and prison spending accounts for a <i>huge</i> proportion of total government budgets, more than half.

1343664,comment,1342635,1343461,0,0,_delirium,,,"On the last point: does that actually happen, though? That's what idealized economic theory would predict, but large corporations' internal structure is quite far from idealized economic theory. My guess would be that if you were able to set up some experiment where one employee cost $100k while somehow having $0 payroll taxes, while another employee cost $90k plus $10k in payroll taxes, the employer would, more often than not, hire the $90k employee.<p>This happens already, I believe, as regards families. Employees with families cost more in health-insurance benefits than single employees, if the employer offers to subsidize a percentage of health insurance (as most do). But employers don't pay single employees of equal qualifications commensurately more, despite what economics would predict.",1273738681

With my assumption of measurement by derivatives above, those would be the students whose knowledge changed the most during the lesson—those who knew the least before <i>and</i> the most after. Thus, teachers would be jockeying for the students most <i>in need of</i> education, not the students who already know the most (because the pretest scores would reveal that the teacher hadn't changed their knowledge very much over the year.)<p>Rather than the current No Child Left Behind policy of regression to the mean, this would assign the most ""learning-intensive"" teachers to the students most in need of learning, and assign the students who self-study or are otherwise pre-informed to teachers who are more ""lenient"", likely diving further into interesting sidebars and tangents.

And that's leaving out more esoteric ideas like FRP (Functional Reactive Programming), the funky type systems needed for efficient purely functional languages, and the less-well-known OO constructs (multimethods, metaobject protocols, etc).<p>No CS curriculum can ever both touch the whole spectrum of what there is to offer and be reasonable to mandate for all students. Inevitably, some students will want the minimum necessary for practical work and others will want to explore as many avenues as possible. The importance is in striking a good balance: exposing students to enough different paradigms to produce good computer scientists without requiring so much that they never get enough real experience with specific languages to be good programmers.",1273737982
