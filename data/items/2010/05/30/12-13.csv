You have full control over who and what you follow, that's the beauty of it. I've found that in general, following any more than about 150 people will get overwhelming.

There are so many different viruses that cause ""the common cold"" and an anti-viral would probably only work on one of them.<p>Just putting together a clinical trial would be incredibly expensive because of the difficulties in picking out patients who have the virus your drug treats while they're still early enough on in their illness to be treatable.

1390391,comment,1390317,1390342,0,0,patio11,,,"Sustainable just means ""more flattering to my sense of aesthetics than the alternatives.""  It is highly non-obvious to me that producing paper cups is more resource intensive than producing clay cups, or that waste produced by clay cups is easier to store than waste produced by paper cups.<p>Clay cups, for example, require dredging up a whole lot of water and river mud, which (despite the fact that it is done inefficiently by poor people, which is apparently the working definition for ""environmentally conscious"" for reasons I do not pretend to understand) is not an ecologically neutral action.  Scale it to Starbucks level consumption and that is an awful lot of river mud.  11 million metric tonnes, by my back of the envelope math.  Plus whatever energy you use in construction of the cups, which aren't exactly carving themselves out of the mud in a carbon-neutral fashion.<p>This could be averted, of course, if people would simply <i>consume less coffee</i>, but that might be a bridge too far for the latte liberals at Starbucks.  I'm sure they'll find a cup which looks absolutely nothing like a paper cup, which will ostentatiously proclaim that consuming <i>this</i> cup of coffee makes you a better person than consuming <i>that other</i> cup of coffee, which is about 99% of the purpose of environmentalism: social signaling of moral worth among rich people for whom traditional religion holds little attraction.",1275222673

Having been severely burnt out from a couple of start-up ventures that ate up 5 years of my time, I'm really just looking for something I can enjoy coding in the background of my life at a leisurely pace.<p>The ideal project would see me spending more time programming on the back-end rather than wasting a day fiddling with CSS, and having to spend lots time considering complex issues rather than doing lots of 'grunt work' coding, and ideally have no time pressures, as it's something I'd do for enjoyment, rather than trying to seek a monetary gain at the end.<p>Any ideas people care to share? Some interesting things I've thought of are:\n   - A TCP/IP scripting language: Basically an interpreter that enabled a user to work at the packet level quickly and easily using simple logical statements depending on what the receiver sends back.<p><pre><code>   - Apache syslog: An Apache module that sends access logs over syslog (I know there are ways to do this already, but you need to use a pipe to logger and that just seems like crud to me).\n\n   - Binary watermarker: Something that watermarks executables that makes discovery and tampering extremely difficult (may not be possible, but worth a shot)\n\n   - Subversion plug-in to automatically perform static code analysis (may exist, haven't looked very hard).\n\n   - Web-based tool for getting yourself or your website/network vulnerability scanned over the Internet.</code></pre>",1275221865
