1360030,comment,1359806,1359980,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Baseball is even <i>better</i> than that. It's a bunch of discrete events that are built out of many, many nigh-identical repetitions of even <i>smaller</i> discrete events.<p>The other point to make is that baseball controls the combinatorial explosion by either having the players act in relative isolation (when fielders handle the ball) or by grouping them in tiny groups of two or three (pitcher, batter, and to some extent the catcher), one of whom is generally a constant in any given game (the catcher), and one of whom only changes a few times per game (the pitcher). This is a fairly restricted set of possible matchups, and these are replayed over and over to get better stats. That's why baseball is the statistician's dream.<p>Similarly, in basketball there are fairly few players on the floor, and they tend to match up with each other fairly predictably. And while American football puts 22 players on the field, most of them never touch the ball, and most of the remaining players do the same sort of job over and over in the same relatively small part of the field, interacting with the same small subset of players on the other team.<p>But soccer is all over the place. ;)",1274240912

This is also compounded by having a knockout cup (where the Goliaths can and do go out) and the teams playing each other in a league far less than most American sports, at about 25 matches a year.

When I left their check out basically meant you always owed them ~$200.  I paid and moved out of state.  6 months later I get a collections call saying I didn't pay the bill.  I told them I paid it, she said it wasn't and said it was going on my report unless I paid that day.  Luckily I paid by check and my bank (like all banks I guess now) keeps canceled checks online for pretty much ever.  So now I had to go back 6 months and find this check then call the apartment then the collections agency, etc...  A HUGE hassle and time waster for me all because the apartment complex employed incompetent people.<p>The kicker was that the girl trying to collect from me said ""people make mistakes and you can't blame them.""
