1359804,comment,1355266,1357092,0,0,jdietrich,,,"She doesn't recognise at any stage that he might actually have feelings, or that his opinion might matter. It isn't that she thinks that this man's life isn't solely about her - she doesn't recognise that his man has a life. Whatever he feels, however he acts, her response is to ignore and invalidate.<p>It is erroneous to believe that what defines narcissism is an obsession with the self. The primary defining trait of the narcissistic personality is the failure to recognise the boundaries between self and others. Narcissists see others as simply an extension of themselves and fail to fully realise the independence of the minds of others. Narcissists have failed to develop the understanding that there is an external reality, acting independently of their own mind.<p>Narcissists are so debilitating to those around them because their internal logic is so different that our natural reactions are confounded. We fail to recognise when narcissists are lying, because to a narcissist anything that comes from their imagination is the truth - narcissists don't experience any stress whatsoever when lying and seem to be absolutely confident in anything they say or do.<p>People who are in relationships with narcissists quickly lose their sense of self, because the narcissist's erroneous sense of personal boundaries erodes their sense of sentience. The best analogy I can give is Orwell's Newspeak - if you live for ten or fifteen years with someone who can genuinely convince themselves that black is white, who acts as if nobody else around them has emotions, who acts as if they are the ultimate arbiter of truth, it absolutely warps your sense of self. There is a vast amount of literature on what happens to the partners of narcissists and this guy seems to fit that pattern exactly.<p>It's not that he's a pussy, it's that after twenty years of being told what he thinks and what he feels, he has a completely eroded sense of self. He doesn't know who he is anymore. That's why he wants to leave and why he finds it so difficult to do so. He came out point blank and said ""It's over, I'm leaving"" because he rightly anticipated that he wouldn't be given any opportunity to discuss it, and that any response he would get would be manipulative. He correctly anticipated how he would be manipulated, but fell for it anyway because he has lost his fucking mind.",1274233748

As it happens I just went from Firefox 3.5 to 3.6 on this machine yesterday, and a deliberately-subjective performance test I just ran has Chrome and Firefox a lot closer to indistinguishable difference. (As an end user, I don't care about 10% differences on this or that benchmark.) I had been using Chrome for the last two weeks, but I have very badly missed NoScript and right click -> ""Block images from this server"". (Stupid flabby stomach ads.) Now I think I'm headed back.<p>But I suppose I can salvage my thesis by saying that at least until recently Chrome had a significant advantage over Firefox. If Firefox's performance catches up, that may staunch the bleeding, because if Chrome isn't much faster, why switch? Firefox definitely has more features, and nobody really cares about HTML5 right now; by the time they do FF will be there.",1274231209
