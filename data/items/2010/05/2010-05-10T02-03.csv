The Food Revolution (Or Diet For a New America) - Tim Robbins
The Omnivore Dilemma (Michael Pollan)
Healthy At 100 - Tim Robbins<p>one last note - Diet for a new america was written in 1988!!!

Nobody that has ever brought a child in to the world had absolutely everything in order. And even if they thought they did they would have soon found out that it was not the case.<p>Then there is the period (pun <i>not</i> intended) between conception and delivery, in which a lot can change.<p>Waiting for the 'perfect time' is the best way to guarantee that you will never have children, there <i>never</i> is a perfect time, there will always be one more thing to fix.<p>Instead, if you want children, go for it while you are young, adaptable and have tons of energy. Worry about fixing problems if and when they appear. Try to do the best you possibly can and if you fail at something try to do it gracefully.<p>That is not a call to go and procreate if you for instance are not able to feed your kids or take care of them, but let's not overdo it on the having everything in order, that's a complete illusion.<p>My parents had 'everything in order' when they got me and my sister, fast forward 6 years and they had a very messy divorce, there are countless examples like that. And there are plenty of counterexamples too, of people that had a pretty tough life, decided to have children and simply did an amazing job of creating a place for them in the world.",1273460207

There are plenty of whole foods that are little better than sugar, and some processed foods that are not horrible. Plus, if you don't have the luxury of eating whole foods for each meal, the glycemic index can help you choose the lesser among evil alternatives.

I work since I finished high school, and the best colleges in Brazil require full dedication, so no time to work. I regret the fact that I decided for continuing my career instead of dedicating myself to get into a public college, right now I just can't do that, because I'm 22 and would have to spend an extra year working on the admission exam preparation.<p>So now I have to pay for whatever college I can afford, in order to get a degree ASAP.

It was very difficult and very engaging; I learned a lot and enjoyed every day.<p>Taking hard classes, though, is not good for college -- I was mostly a B student (but in things like number theory, linear algebra, electricity & magnetism), and was being compared against the A students from average high schools when it came to college admissions.  The result was that I didn't get in anywhere really great, went to an average school, and was so bored that I basically failed out.  (Technically, I withdrew without credit after the second semester.  The first semester was great, because I took classes that I wanted to take instead of ""required classes"", including DJB's UNIX security course.  If every class was like that, I would have never wanted to leave college.  But sadly, most classes involved little more than showing up and reading 1000 pages of boring books.)<p>If the college classes had been more interesting than kindergarten, I would have gone... but the reality was that the professors didn't speak English, the students didn't speak English, and I already knew everything they were teaching me anyway.  It wasn't going to work.  It depressed me, so I had to leave.<p>The good news is that once you get out of academia and into the real world, the odds shift very greatly in favor of the gifted.  Nobody cares how hard you work, they care that you solve their problems.  Seems like every year, a new job offer comes around that wants to double my salary -- not exactly what the academic establishment would say about long-haired hippies that get up at noon and dropped out of college.<p>But the programming world is an odd one :)",1273457454
