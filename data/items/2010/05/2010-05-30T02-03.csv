That’s fragmentation you want – iPhone apps make no sense on that device.<p>Other than that, doubling the horizontal and vertical number of pixels (four times the pixels) is actually quite clever and will probably not lead to any fragmentation. Since the display’s size won’t change in any significant way, old iPhone apps will just look the same on the new device (every pixel will just be displayed four times, no need for ugly interpolation) – everything that’s a vector and not pixels will just look better without any effort on the developers’ part. The old iPhones presumably won’t have any problem with apps that come with higher resolution bitmaps.<p>Since the screen size doesn’t change it also doesn’t make any sense to add any additional elements which would then be too small for older devices – the size of our fingers and the resolution of our eyes is the limiting factor here, not the resolution of the screen.<p>All of this also means that a increase in resolution is no more a big leap forward (i.e. it allows you to display more stuff), it “merely” makes text, videos and photos look much nicer.

1389803,comment,1389583,1389724,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I understand that, and apologize for my loose terminology. There are two reasons I suggest employing a larger size.<p>The first is to do with flow, as you mention. While all of a large cap needs to be able to withstand high pressure, that is not in itself an especially tricky engineer problem. But size doesn't hurt; in my experience it's rather easier to stop up a large pipe than a small one with the same pressure, simply because it's a less delicate maneuver. In the case of a domestic plumbing crisis, it's nice to be able to exert your arm rather than just your fingers.<p>The other reason is simply to do with bulk. The larger the cylinder, the greater it weight when finally sealed, the more room you have to anchor it, and the farther from the (presumably fragile) ground in the immediate vicinity of the gusher the circumference will be, if one is trying to bore into the ground with restraining pegs.<p>The surgical approach has not been very successful so far.

1389798,comment,1389583,1389724,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I should also note that the idea of blocking the hole with gravel isn't exactly a bad one. You're right to point out that if you use big pebbles for your gravel the oil will just squeeze through the abundant empty spaces. So... use finer gravel!<p>The pressure will try to push the gravel out. So maybe make it really sticky gravel, so that it glues itself together.<p>Now there are three things to say about this plan:<p>(a) we call this sticky, very fine gravel <i>concrete</i> and we use it all the time;<p>(b) a fun educational point: Even with really <i>fine</i> gravel, oil can still diffuse through it. Oil diffuses through ""solid"" rock all the time. The oil underground is actually trapped inside rock. The rock that holds the oil is relatively porous; the oil is kept underground because above that rock is a layer of denser rock that oil can't diffuse through very well.<p>(c) In case it isn't obvious yet: The reason your idea still doesn't work very well is that the first cupful of wet concrete you pour onto the hole will promptly get flushed away by the pressure of the leaking oil. ;) As will <i>every successive cupful</i> of wet concrete. Unfortunately, a giant slab of solid concrete must necessarily start out life as a thin layer of wet concrete, so the only way to put a concrete seal over a hole that is actively leaking is to cast it someplace else and then drop it on the hole.",1275187677

At every point along the wall of a sealed vessel, the pressure is constant. So if, e.g., the pressure of the hole when sealed would be 100 PSI, then to stop it every square inch of the seal needs to withstand that 100 PSI.<p>If the top of your concrete cylinder has, say, 100 times the area of the hole, then the <i>flow</i> of oil may end up evenly distributed over that area. But if you then try to seal the top you must now provide the same strength of seal -- it must withstand the same pressure -- over a much larger area, which is probably <i>harder</i> to accomplish.<p>This seems counterintuitive, just as the lever is counterintuitive. But we use this principle all the time to lift things like elevators and cars. You push on a tiny-diameter cylinder with your arms (or with a little electric motor), and it pumps fluid into a much larger-diameter cylinder under the car, and the car rises. Of course, you have to pump up and down dozens or hundreds of times to lift the car one inch.",1275185538
