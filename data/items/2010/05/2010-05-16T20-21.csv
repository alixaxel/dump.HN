Just for fun, let's look at the most popular manga on One Manga:<p><a href=""http://www.onemanga.com/directory/top/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onemanga.com/directory/top/</a><p>1-4: Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Fairy Tail. These all have blood and violence. They generally don't have much sexual content, though there is occasional mild fanservice.<p>5. Hajime no Ippo. It's about boxing. There <i>will</i> be blood. And broken bones, and so on.<p>6. Full Metal Alchemist. <i>Pretty gosh-darn violent.</i> Dark, too.<p>7. History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi. Guess what: it's another fighting manga! Less bloody than you might expect, actually, and I'm pretty sure they keep the sexual content down to PG-13 levels. This one would probably get through! Way to go, Apple!<p>Skipping #8, because I've never heard of it...<p>9. Hunter X Hunter. Quickly flipping through it at random turned up a page in chapter 28 where a murderous nightmare clown is carrying a severed head. Pretty tame sexually, though.<p>10. No Bra. There is no way in hell this would pass any censor, anywhere, ever. Moving on,<p>11. Mahou Sensei Negima. Oh dear lord, no. It's not just the violence, although it has violence aplenty. It has pretty vast amounts of sexual content, most of it involving characters who are, at most, 15 years old. (Fun fact: has a <i>freakishly</i> long TV Tropes page.)<p>This kind of strict policy doesn't just block a lot of manga; it blocks almost all of the most popular manga. It's madness, and the policy's only redeeming virtue is that it probably won't be applied consistently, so they might let some stuff through that they would have blocked if they'd been more thorough.",1274041064

A few friends of mine used to be in an (internationally) rather popular rock band in the 90's (if you're over 30, it is quite possible that you've heard of them). They have stopped playing together since then but now, after many years, they decided to do one last world tour. Given that they're all British citizens, they had to get a US working visa for the concerts in the US. To get the visa, they had to actually  prove that the fans wouldn't be exactly satisfied with the performance of a similarly named tribute band (formed by US citizens). I know that this is required to keep foreign ""commodity musicians"" from playing in bars and restaurants but sill quite funny, considering their (former) popularity.<p>(In the end, they managed to get their visa.)",1274040741

You say you'd love to work a few days a week in a cafe or book shop, but worry that it would not pay well enough -- you should figure out how much you need so you know.   You may need to adjust your lifestyle - it is far easier to not spend a dollar than it is to get a dollar.<p>You may find it hard to get a part-time job to start off with.  It may be easier to work a full time job for a few months, and then ask to cut back.  If you save money in the mean time, you can quit if they refuse and seek out a better position.<p>There are a lot of posts here about the best kinds of part-time jobs.  In reality, you are probably not going to be able to pick out the ultimate pay-the-rent-while-I-code-my-startup job; you are going to end up with one of the first few you actually find, and finding that job itself may be a full time effort for a while.<p>In that light, I'd like to suggest that the actual job and environment doesn't matter so much as you'd think, and that the fact that it is DIFFERENT is what matters.<p>Ideas for good products come from experience, not from cloistered ivory tower environments.   You might come with a great product after working with several different inventory or point-of-sale systems, or observing how an independent roofing contractor maintains all his contacts on his phone, or whatever.<p>All the great American writers first learned by writing about real life things - Steinbeck filed many short newspaper stories on dust bowl refugees before he wrote the Grapes of Wrath, Clemens did the same and wrote of real experience in ""Roughing It"" before his masterpieces.<p>Here's my advice:  1) know your expences and cut them where appropriate; 2) get a job, and quit it within the first 2 weeks if it obviously sucks, and then get another one; 3) while working, agressively attend meetups and similar events so you don't become socially isolated; 4) after 3 months, ask your boss if you can cut back to part time if you need to do that - if he says no, work another 3 months and ask again; 5) if he still says no, quit, re-evaluate working a corporate development job, and start over again at step 1 if that's what you need to do.",1274040695

If you go to the CRA website you'll find lots of documentation.  The registration process is simple too -- fill out a form, send it in, and wait for a number to arrive in the mail.  (I think it's free; if not, it's only a nominal fee.)<p>The worst problem I've had with paypal has been a few customers being blocked from making direct credit card payments -- but after they created paypal accounts everything worked fine.  (I'm guessing that they were borderline on paypal's fraud-detection systems, and providing information as part of the process of creating paypal accounts was enough to push them into the 'safe' category).<p>If you're taking payments mostly from Canadians, mostly from businesses, or mostly in >$100 amounts, you might want to skip credit card processing in favour of cheques.",1274040694

The ""carbon free"" service would work great in my area where there is a high density of people in town homes with small front lawns.<p>Maybe YMMV on the small lawn mowers. But I have had extremely good luck with them. I think that most of the problem people have with mowers is failing to maintain them properly. In my experience, if you can buy a used mower that will start quickly without much hassle it can generally be kept in decent working order for a long time. But purchasing one of these used mowers was why I said the idea scales. It's pretty easy to get enough work out of a used mower to buy a better quality mower.<p>Thanks for sharing your insight.
