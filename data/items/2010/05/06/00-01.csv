You get a different quality of work, support, and dedication. Ever had an unpaid intern? They take up more time than they're worth. Free labor is very expensive...<p>> And Einstein was not a bad example to pick out of that. His contributions possibly number in the trillions, yet his salary was quite low.<p>Salary is a part of compensation, but not all of it. Again, the U.S. President makes something like $400,000 per year, but his total compensation including prestige, perks, fame, power, etc, etc is one of the highest in the USA. Salary is not the only form of compensation. Money/direct monetary benefits is not the only form of compensation. When you can eat anywhere for free, and stay in any hotel or palace as an honored guest for free, you don't really need so much money any more.
