Would totally solve our issues.<p>details:<p>We just moved a fairly large Rails 2.3.4 app to 1.9.1 this week and have run into a number of 'incompatible charset encoding' issues.<p>My client is running a site that sends middle american students to middle american colleges. There's not a foreign character or thought in sight (which is a separate issue). However, our content writers occasionally use MS Word and a ""smart quote"" slips into the uploaded content.<p>When that happens, our rails HAML layout is in one encoding, and the partial that renders the smart-quote-bomb text from the database are now in different encodings, and the page errors.<p>The solution is to write a custom sanitize() method on string that forces encodings and gsubs away smart quotes. The consequences of missing one in 1.9.1 are just higher than in 1.8.7.",1273111190

Even if they did, trying to determine a utility function for a consumer would still fail.

I didn't see any software crashes. The tablet, on the other hand, did have quite a few hardware problems. But that's because it was literally made just this demo. The tablet is encased in a clear plastic case that looked like it was hacked together in some lab. One of the Adobe employees told me it had ""a motherboard and NVIDIA card"". Some of the hardware connections were loose apparently because when I would set it down on the table a bit too sharply, some of the buttons would fire sometimes sending me back to the home screen. The touch screen didn't seem the best quality as someone else noticed. It wasn't very responsive. Not sure if that was a hard drive or software problem.<p>On the Droid, I watched a movie preview on Yahoo Movies and it played flawlessly.<p>So as for me, from what I saw today, I'm cautiously optimistic about flash on phones/tablets.

They work for you and me, the taxpayer. I can't even begin to comprehend how unions in this sector have ever been a benefit to the economy or the public.<p>I find it outrageous that it was ever allowed to happen, since, evidenced by your own viewpoint and conclusion, it has utterly eroded what unionization stands for.<p>I agree that unionized industrial labor was a good idea in 1900. I don't think unionized public employees were <i>ever</i> a good idea. Isn't this kind of corruption the stuff of revolutions? ""Taxation without representation"" is what it appears to amount to.<p>In the private sector, unions might still make sense as a hedge against corporate exploitation of workers, as other commentors have pointed out. They also might not. Your grocery store example I've seen here in the Bay Area, and the market is quite unforgiving to a business with such slim margins.<p>[1] The automakers are a pretty muddled situation, though the US government now owns enough of GM that I'd consider it little different from the postal service.",1273108374

Is Unicode not capable of encoding the full Japanese language? What information would you loose by encoding with Unicode?<p>The problem is that SHIFT-JIS, and other regional east asian encodings, codify variations of characters that Unicode combine into one. The Japanese in particular dislike this conflation of characters that they feel should be separate. This process of combining characters was called Han Unification:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_unification</a><p>Now imagine that you're a Japanese user who feels that three similar ideograms are in fact sematically different, but a standards body has decided that the differences are merely stylistic and has combined them into one form: I'm sure you wouldn't be as willing to lay your language at the feet of Unicode and swear allegiance to the one true encoding.<p>Also consider that UTF-8 is optimized for efficient encoding of Western languages: a japanese text may be in practice four to eight times the size of a sematically similar version in a western language. SHIFT-JIS presumably does not suffer from this problem.<p>> This seems to be a much better solution than this encoding nightmare. Esp in a language like Ruby, I want to have it simple and straightforward.<p>Except that languages are not really that simple or straightforward. I appreciate the flexibility of Ruby 1.9's encoding system. The only thing really broken right now are the tools that wycats mentions in this post.",1273108043

If P does not finish, then you have no answer. If you have no answer, then P does not do what we defined it to do.<p>But I think you're missing the more important point. We <i>defined</i> P to be a certain way, and as a result of that definition, we also demonstrated that it cannot do what we defined it to do. That's the fundamental problem. If you want to think of it in terms of what you're currently hung up on, then consider that implicit in our definition of P is that <i>it will finish</i>.<p>Also consider that if P does not finish, it's no better than just running the program with its input and observing the behavior.",1273107990

If you divide the area of a chip by the size of a transistor, you should get 100 billion transistors on a chip, but in fact you can only get about 1 billion. The rest is overhead: wiring, power, isolation, etc. Probably a similar overhead will apply to memristors.<p>Also, in the 5+ years it takes to make them practical and reliable, transistors will make progress too. So it's unfair to compare the theoretical density of a new technology to the achieved density of an existing technology.",1273107757
