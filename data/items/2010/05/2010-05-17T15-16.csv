This sounds like more complaining from authors doing sloppy js-only work.<p>Sometimes incompatibility is a necessary evil, but that's not true on the web.

This creation of a complete <i>product</i> is what has made Apple so successful in the last decade and seems to me to clearly be the 'building' of a product.<p>Anyway, if vision and negative taste are cheap and easy, why don't more tech companies seem to have them? It doesn't at all seem to me that the trait that makes Apple stand out is that they have engineers that are head and shoulders above the rest of the industry. Not at all.

Switching from a Microsoft intellisomething keyboard to a Model M (and a Logitech web keyboard before it) reduced my wrist pain (and I'm already on Dvorak). At work, I'm now using a Microsoft keyboard once more, and have noticed a marked increase in wrist pain.""<p>I don't disbelieve you -- and, in fact, would report the same.  Model Ms are awesome.<p>However.<p>What makes a good keyboard is very much a personal thing.  It depends on many factors.  How tall you are; what position you sit in; what kind of chair you use; how high your chair is adjusted; what your posture is like within that chair; how high your desk is; how high your desk is relative to your chair; how the monitor is oriented; how long your arms are; the ambient temperature; how large your hands are; how strong your fingers are; what position you hold your fingers in over the keyboard (I maintain that holding your fingers over the home row as a default position is insane); how often you take breaks; what kind of exercises you do during those breaks, if any; what kind of exercises you do before sitting down to type, and when you're done for the day; and how many hours a day you type are the first few factors that spring to mind.  I didn't have to try hard to come up with this list.<p>So the Model M works for you, and it works for me too.

I'm sure this will be fixed eventually even if no one picks it up this summer.<p>3. Destructive commands actually, well, destroying stuff. This point makes me feel like the author knew git first, tried mercurial out, and switched back, making the blog post a little misleading. I don't know how you could expect a delete not to be a delete unless you were familiar with something like git already. If I were to run a delete command in Mercurial, I would read the documentation on the command first to make sure it created a backup for me. Only if it then failed to create this backup would I complain. Also, I think I prefer the bundle approach of Mercurial. You can always rename the bundles to keep track of them. You could even write your own extension in 5 lines that ran a destructive command and immediately unbundled the created bundle to restore your changesets, exactly duplicating git's functionality.<p>The first two issues he mentions I would consider to be actually valid complaints against Mercurial, the third just a personal preference of the author.

The repository structure isn't particularly good - it ""works"" for the most part but sometimes you just want to kick it. And forget hacking around with it..<p>Silly things like ""hg copy [file]"" doesn't copy file history but does a remove/add & cp/rm are another ball ache.<p>Ultimately hg is a <i>good</i> tool; for lightweight, hackerish version control it is great. Beyond that? Yeh, use Git.",1274108666

The best early-stage employees also need to fit that description, so aspirants need to figure out ways of demonstrating those qualities.<p>Of course when everyone starts doing it, it'll stop working, and smart, determined guys like Nick will figure out some new way of hacking the recruitment process.",1274108664

I once worked for a company that had won an award as ""One of the 50 best managed private companies in Canada"" several years running.<p>The procedure for judging this award consisted of accountants coming in and measuring the degree to which our decisions were driven by documented, repeatable processes. At no time did they measure how well our products were selling, the quality of the talent we were able to attract, or our turnover.<p>My point being that there are means and ends, and when you put a lot of work into measuring the means, you get a lot of emphasis on means. I will NOT suggest that your ends automatically suffer, just that the correlation between repeatable and universal ways of measuring means and the ends you achieve are loose at best.",1274108518
