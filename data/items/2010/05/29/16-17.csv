The US has always been concerned with figuring out its racial composition, since slavery and all its multitude of consequences (Jim Crow, lots of poor blacks leaving the south for Northern cities) have made it so important.  Think of all the money and power that used to go with whether you were white or black, or whether you could treat an employee (or slave) as white or black, or whether your state had a lot of black people or not who only got you 3/5 of a representative!<p>It is starting to seem anachronistic to worry over race (thank god!), but that history is really very recent; think about bussing riots in the 1970s, etc.  Also, a huge number of government programs have a mission to try to fix racial disparities (successfully or not), and they need information on basic racial population composition.<p>That said, I can't wait until nobody cares about race anymore.  The litmus test on this will be whether (""inter"") marriage matters; in coastal cities among college educated people, it isn't really news if one's parents are asian and white, or latino and white, but it still elicits comment and introspection if they are black and white...<p>I think the big dividing lines today depend on education and family cultural background, but I am not sure how a decennial census might track that.",1275151290

I assumed that most of the challenge would be in mapping and mastering the problem domain:  figuring out what problems you need to solve, researching existing solutions to each problem, finding code and adapting it for your needs, experimenting to see if the existing solutions work well for your particular problems, adapting them if necessary, and then wiring it all together in a simple way using a glue language.  Lots of work and sophisticated AI stuff there (probably a few PhDs if you took it far enough) but no fancy programming.

The food you eat is more expensive in California because there is a high floor on the compensation required for the people who produce it. Your coworkers require higher salaries because it's more expensive to live in California.<p>According to Salary.com's cost of living calculator[1], for every four $100,000 engineers in San Francisco, you can get five $80,000 engineers in Austin at the same salary percentile.

Maybe it attracts the best people (and I note you had to say ""perhaps"" since you are just speculating), but it <i>definitely</i> raises the costs of doing business quite substantially, which means less ability to hire, expand, or exist at all. That's not speculation, that's the entire purpose of regulation like this; the government directs you to spend money in this manner or go out of business, no third option.<p>You must also consider that the California system as a whole, which includes its regulatation system, <i>has become</i> unaffordable and California faces the task of either tearing some of it down or raising taxes to make up for it, and one way or another you must account that negative to that system, too. It's easy to ""politic"" away the problem of unaffordability for quite a while, just as we have done, until suddenly it produces a result far worse than if we had done the putatively-inferior-but-actually-affordable thing in the first place. Unaffordability is not a political matter, it's an objective one that can't be argued away.

As noted in the article these are mostly srather narrow pure computation benchmarks, so the OS shouldn't matter a lot. Sure, the OS X kernel is crap when it comes to supporting exotic features, so SBCL has to do a little bit of extra work around bugs in things like signal handling. And I could believe using mprotect() for a hardware write barrier have a worse relative performance compared to a software barrier on OS X than on Linux. But at least in the context of pure computation these kinds of effects shouldn't distort things all that much.",1275148993
