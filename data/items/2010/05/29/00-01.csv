I was trying to explain to him how I viewed your former employer as being <i>too</i> successful.<p>I said Blizzard was Too Successful in that WoW achieves profitability to the detriment of fiendish players, many of whom waste untold hours of what would otherwise be productive time. He, being an almost pure libertarian, disagreed with all too familiar logic: ""it's not <i>my</i> fault they get addicted"", etc.<p>I then asked him if he would sell drugs, and he responded that he already had.

I also get links from friends on Facebook. Finally, on Twitter, I follow mostly what Kevin Rose calls ""tastemakers"" and sometimes get some links from them, amongst the general ""what are you doing?"" updates.<p>But if I just want to read some stuff, it's all separated.<p>Friends, tastemakers and publishers in the same interface could be a really good mix.<p>Basically, Digg can become the one-stop shop for links and articles: some from my friends, some from tastemakers, my RSS feeds, and I suppose also from the Digg users in general (friends or not).

As a Technician, I started a company focused around building what I loved to build (good software). To a certain point, it's easy for N co-founders to keep juggling all the balls that comprise running a business (rather than just writing code). This is the ""Infancy Phase,"" and all was well, just as he describes.<p>It was the ""Adolescent Phase"" of the business where everything fell apart. All the various things we were juggling became too much, and they started to fall by the wayside. In my specific companies, I think a big cause of this was trying to do <i>too much</i> in terms of product.<p>And so I followed one of the paths he predicts--I threw my hands up, and started small again with a new company. The revelation that did it was pretty much exactly what he writes:<p><pre><code>    You realize something you've avoided all these years...\n    You don't own a business--you own a job... the worst job in the world!\n    You can't close it when you want to...
