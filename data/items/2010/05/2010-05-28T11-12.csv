1386153,comment,1385783,1385828,0,0,elblanco,,,"Japan's efforts in hi-tech have always been different than other places, transport engineering, robotics, electronics, etc. Basically ""stuff"" but not software. I think it could be successfully argued that Japan is miles ahead of the West in certain areas like robotics or mobile digital television transmission.<p>Software on the other hand has long been the Achilles heal of the Japanese technology industry. I read a great article one time on why that is (sorry I couldn't find the link to it, but this is somewhat along the same line <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5069366/why-zen-software-design-does-not-come-from-japan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5069366/why-zen-software-design-does-not-...</a> ) that attributes it to generally historic reasons. Principally that the Japanese language was hard to build into cheap computers early in the electronics boom and the result is that efforts (both engineering and in terms of cultural assimilation) simply went into other areas. Instead of PCs, people had fancy cell phones. Instead of people going into software and interface engineering, they went into analog and digital circuit designs. You could commonly get a cell phone in Japan that could take photos and videos, pay for a soda, access the Internet had ring tones (both for you and for the caller), could play games and mp3s long before you could get the equivalent in the U.S. Which sounds great on a pure features list, but the software on the phones generally stank.<p>While hardware engineering in Japan is generally more mature than the equivalent in the West, the opposite is true of software engineering. Part of this means that sub-areas of SE are also more mature, like interface design. However, in Japan, consumers are trained to buy off of bullet points, so even devices like the iPhone had trouble taking off ( <a href=""http://www.teleread.com/2009/02/27/why-the-iphone-is-not-popular-in-japan/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teleread.com/2009/02/27/why-the-iphone-is-not-pop...</a> ) simply because it lacks features most users want, despite the fact that accessing the features it does have is a better experience.<p>It's an interesting Paradox because you would think the opposite would be true. The Japanese traditional aesthetic <i>should</i> drive people to clean and simple UIs 
, but a couple generations of consumers simply haven't been brought up in that environment. The effect of course is that a couple generations of developers haven't been raised in an environment where there was demand for good UI.",1275047355

Immediately you have the problem of the less skilled not being able to follow the code pratices of the gifted coder, it will be harder to reuse. And the when somebody else has to extend it will cost a lot more time, or to correct something.<p>Surely some parts of code should be clever, sometimes it has to be clever because there are no alternatives. It should always be somehow well contained. But if you start evaluating code <i>per se</i> you surely end with a bad compromise.<p>Isn't this obvious to everybody who has to lead a team(I don't)?",1275046930

It is like the difference between a program and a product.  There is a lot of work necessary to make the transition. For example, a product is made up of 1) the program 2) the release discipline, 3) manufacturing (admittedly near zero for cloud) 4) marketing and 5) support.<p>I would think that also whatever they have built has a bit of a proprietary nature which when exposed to the cloud would reveal things about their strategy that might make their trading strategy more public than they would want.<p>So I would be a little surprised if this popped up on the grid.

That's the way un-clever programmers do. Clever programmers, instead, invest lots of time into reinventing things that don't need reinventing, and then must be learned by those who come after them; and implementing things that don't need to be reimplemented. Reams of copy-pasted code is not the affliction of the clever programmer. Instead, you discover that there's a strategy factory to instantiate a strategy that chooses which home-grown database abstraction layer to use and what kind of caching to apply to it; and that there's a home-grown template library on top of that, with its own caching layer. And it's all configured with a plugin system that uses a bunch of XML metadata files for each plugin — all in order to run a message board.",1275044662
