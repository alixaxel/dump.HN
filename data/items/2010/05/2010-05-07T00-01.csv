E.g. if I have some really interesting content, I could post it on some public hosting site, or own my own web site, and if it genuinely is interesting, it'll hit the main page of a site like Digg/Reddit, and therefore sell itself.<p>I think the move away from plugin prison to HTML5 is great (am myself a developer), but we know that the mass majority don't buy based on techie cool-ness (if they did, then Apple's developer un-friendly-ness would drive them all to Android!)<p>Sounds to me like you guys want to be the YouTube for documents?

I guess like Smugmug's founder's interview, there'll always be a high-end niche of any market (are you trying conquer the ""high-end"" and ""niche"" documents? If so, then perhaps it might be a branding problem?) As in, if people perceive you as an expensive brand, then naturally people will _want_ to publish via Scribd.

What do you need for a thriving post-industrial economy?<p>You need a culture that can deal with change. You need companies that are small and agile. You need incentive structures that reward ideas over performance. You need a government that is not stuck in bureaucracy. You need a thriving VC investment climate with Angel Investors that are willing to take risk. You need entrepreneurs that take risk. You need an education system that rocks. And guess what, Japan has none of that [12, 13].""</i><p>I'll take exception to the one statement that Japan is not able to deal with change. If you look at the history of Japan, they are probably the only country in the history of the world to go from a medieval society closed off to foreign influence to a global power in less than 75 years. The reasons for this ability are complicated and may only work at the macro level, but it does demonstrate an enormous capability for change.<p>The article is right, however.

In a nutshell, japan has now a strong position but will decline economically if the current government doesn't take serious steps to reduce and avoid, e.g. bureaucracy overhead.<p>Some interesting points from my notes:<p>- The case of Apple vs. Sony is for instance only a software issue not hardware. Sony doesn't encourage collaboration.<p>- Apple iPod production is a very interesting case anyway in respect that it is partly made in japan [1]<p>- Growth in regional differences (e.g. fukoaka prefecture has invested heavily in education and infrastructure. Has now strong ties with Busan area in Korea.) will be strong drivers for future markets.<p>- Too many ""big basket"" companies in japan<p>- Very competitive market (e.g. accepted ROI in japan is 4-5% while internationally it is more like 10-15%)<p>- Privatisation in japan started in 2005 (!). It takes very long to get products into the market<p>- Successful companies managed to roll their own efficient distribution chain (e.g. Uniqlo, Ikea, 7eleven)<p>- It takes at least twice as long to get the ROI than anywhere else. International companies are too short sighted<p>- Japanese consumers are very demanding and less forgiving. To get it right here is very difficult.<p>Startup wise there is also a growing environment, especially in seed funding for new ideas University wise. I attended another presentation from UTEC [3] where the growth rates they had were very impressive.<p>Current outlook for japan is not good, but that is mostly because they are too immobile and have too much bureaucracy.
