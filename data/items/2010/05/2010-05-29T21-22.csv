A very clear articulation of the place of creativity:<p><i>Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.</i><p>and design:<p><i>Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works. The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it's all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it.</i><p>The missing part for me is that he doesn't see that they're like yin and yang with each other. Grokking leads to creativity, and creativity leads to grokking. Most people who aren't engineers don't quite understand the profoundness of that feedback loop. I feel like he mostly does -- but there's still this small little missing link. It could even be his Achilles' heel. But yeah, in everything else he is quite clairvoyant.",1275170371

Shadow of the Colossus is the best refutation to Ebert that I can think of.<p>One factor that you're leaving out is the moral horror of painfully slaughtering these giant and beautiful creatures.  Often the colossi are completely benign, and you have to figure out a way to injure them to get their attention or bring them down to your level.  My wife watched me play the first level, and left the room horrified.<p>Thus, the emotional reaction of the player is a key component of the art.  I began the game tackling the first colossus with feelings of guilt and shame for being such a butcher, but that was tempered by the knowledge that the kill was a <i>necessary</i> act.  You have a love to save, after all.<p>However, as you progress through the game your revulsion subsides.  You become numb to the screams of pain, the frenzied attempts to shrug you off.  It becomes simple sport, instead of a vile but necessary act.  The kills devolve to ""just a game"".  Your character physically reflects this, as you become gradually darker and deformed, but at such a slow pace that you don't notice until the corruption is quite far along.<p>And then, at the end, after you thrill to the final hard-won kill, the morality comes rushing back.  What you've done was wrong. Evil.  Even though you set out with the best of intentions, your soul is now irredeemable.  The guilt is intense.  Then, finally, redemption of a sort.<p>SotC is emotionally richer than most films, and the responses that it evokes would not be possible in any other medium.

1389280,comment,1388905,1389217,0,0,sjs,,,"I switched to Emacs so I could use the same editor on Linux and OS X. I made the switch wholesale and used TM only to look at diffs or browse a project quickly (Emacs need something like the project drawer, and speedbar isn't the answer).<p>I forgot about all the nice things I liked about TM. defunkt's textmate.el gets you part of the way there but isn't enough. I've had to implement lots of small things and discover features I didn't know about Emacs (global-auto-revert-mode). Right now I'm working on selecting an enclosed region (ie. find the innermost text surrounded by a pair of quotes or parens/braces/brackets and select it), which is Cmd-Shift-B in TM.<p>A friend and co-worker uses TM and the little niceties have tempted me to switch back since I mainly use OS X these days, however I'm simply better off with Emacs. TM is great but unfortunately while TM2 is in the works TM users are left out in the cold. There aren't many things Emacs doesn't already do due to its nature (open source and tradition of sharing code) and the things it doesn't do I can write myself. So I can bring Emacs up to speed with TM but not the other way around. Open source is a giant win for developer tools.<p>I don't want to bash TM or disrespect all the hard work Allan has put and is putting into TM. TM has influenced just about every modern text editor on many platforms and we are all better off because of TM even if we never used it. But if you're not happy with TM there are viable alternatives.<p>We all know the drawbacks to systems with a SPOF and it's not a good trade-off for a development tool as critical as your text editor. Sorry Allan, I truly am, but as TM2 takes longer and longer it gives people a big reason to migrate to another editor. Once switched, it's going to be a tough sell to get people to switch back without any guarantee that such a thing will never happen again. Especially if they switch to an infinitely customizable editor such as vim or Emacs where it's possible to mimic TM's best features, even if it's not as easy as in TM.<p>If any TM users do try Emacs get github.com/defunkt/textmate.el and have a look at github.com/samsonjs/config/tree/master/emacs for TM-refugee goodies.",1275167806
