While Darwin's work was controversial, he was buried at Westminster Abbey -- hardly a rejection by the establishment.
Can a man who was Master of the Royal Mint and President of the Royal Society be considered a complete outsider?  Faraday, as professor at the Royal Institution had a role both being an official scientific advisor and in expounding science to the public.  Surely more the Feynman of his day than complete outsider.

The awful truth about Android is that while Apple and Google know software, none of the people Google is partnering with, handset makers or telecoms, do. None of them understand what it takes to make high-quality, defect free software, or what 3rd party developers need from a platform, or what end-users expect from software. I can tell you that having sold to and consulted for them, and having family members who've worked for them, the telecoms are particularly clueless about these things.

Given that experience I'd put forth the following points...<p>Pros:<p>1.  Despite what RoR fans claim I think you can get things done faster in ASP.NET MVC 2 (if you use Visual Studio). All  the usability enhancements combined with technology like WCF simply help you get things done faster (though there's a down side to this advantage in the cons)<p>2.  On the above note I still think C# is a vastly superior language especially now that it's essentially ""borrowed"" the best parts of Python<p>Cons:<p>1.  The main reason to go with a MVC framework is ease of testing and the RoR community is far more robust and hence offers far more testing options<p>2.  (Related to Pros #1) Using Microsoft technology like WCF creates performance woes.  I would question using it on a really high performance site<p>3.  You really need to buy Microsoft servers.  I haven't even tested MVC 2 on Mono but MVC 1 was spotty and not officially supported<p>4.  Support is minimal on the Internet.  Again this boils down to there being far, far more Ruby developers (Let's face it ASP.NET MVC is a subset of the already smaller ASP.NET developer community)<p>I don't know if that helps but those are my initial thoughts.",1274684468
