Hell, look at how they're stagnating in the web browser arena.<p>Microsoft plays second fiddle <i>all the time</i>.

SQL Server.<p>> Bing is an also ran that can't even come close to Google's dominance, no matter how much money they throw at consumers with that cashback scheme.<p>I've heard good things about Bing.  Claiming they bought all their users is disingenuous.<p>> When the vast majority of users are obsessed with social networking, writing small little text/tweets, bite-size 2D addictive casual games with one-button control, and playing music and youtube videos, how are you going to cash in on that if you're a Microsoft? Try to replicate Zynga and Twitter? Then what?<p>You don't, and you then compare the current financials of Microsoft, Zynga, and Twitter.<p>> Maybe -- and this could be the key -- MS needs to start _aquiring_ technologies instead of trying to reinvent them like they're some garage startup.<p>Microsoft acquires companies _all the time_.  It's a common criticism: ""Microsoft has never created anything.  They've just bought out companies that create things.""  ""Like some garage startup""?

Does the company need to pay her for that training time?  I am not a lawyer so I don't have those answers, but I am a manager and know I don't ever want to ask them.  I believe it is safe to say that applies to virtually all companies of any size in the US.<p>Now, what he could have done is, much as Jacquesm described, recommended her the same day he turned in notice and offered to train her.  This would have let management make the final decision and get all the papework in order while he still gets to help out a friend by helping her get a job and help out the company by saving them the trouble of finding a replacement on two weeks notice (if they choose to avail themselves of it by hiring her.)<p>I have taken that second route, and that effort, in full consultation with senior management, has always been appreciated.
