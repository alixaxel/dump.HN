1336712,comment,1324913,1325070,0,0,adrianscott,,,"Hi Vincent, Thanks for your comment. My comments below:\n1. The facebook issue you mention was already in the past. To clarify, this concern is not about that. This is about after you made the change for that, and then did an additional change of taking out the blog name.<p>2. I totally respect if it was not Posterous' intent per se to do a 'brand grab'. At the same time, if we look at the change it is clear that it is now +more Posterous brand, and - less individual blog brand. For example, Posterous changed the wording to 'Read more on Posterous' and not 'Read more on my blog'. So in that context, it is at least a 'Posterous brand enlargement', and a 'user brand removal'.<p>3. As I mention previously I suggest that the team be concerned about the brand perception they are creating. I recommend you speak with trusted outsiders to get some independent feedback on this. Posterous would benefit significantly from better communication. significantly...<p>4. Garry requested constructive suggestions and several members have replied with suggestions that can work without needing to have an option. Can we have feedback from Posterous about these suggestions? (I think the overall suggestion is that for names > than the max # of chars, use just the first letter of the 'border-crossing' word, followed by an ellipsis character.) (I suggest you discuss it in your blog rather than here, though feel free to do so here as well).<p>5. Users are giving you some valuable feedback here that you can use to increase the value of your offering, the value of your corporation and also your long-term profits. I hope you will appreciate this free feedback and find a way to leverage it.<p>6. Bloggers do care very much about building brands for their blogs, so this area can be high value add for your service offering.<p>7. In terms of not wanting to announce all of the many changes you discuss making, how do you wish for us users and potentially paying customers to communicate feedback to you?<p>8. We would not be investing the time to provide you with this feedback if we were not big fans overall of your offering, and appreciative of the work you've put into it.<p>9. If you feel that you'd prefer simplicity over providing users branding capabilities, can you recommend another solution for us? You already offer many great branding capabilities, such as the domain name mapping, and favicon.ico setting capability, which were key features in my decision to try out your platform. I have less urge to  post now though, admittedly.<p>I hope these comments and this feedback help!",1273546762

I've been trying to deal with all the complexity of working copy/index/local repostory/remote repository/other remote repositories, merging changes back and forth, and umpteen other things, for a good few months now.  It's genuinely Hard (TM).<p>I <i>have</i> definitely done occasionally awesome things, like amending commits with small noticed typos before pushing, stashing is totally awesome, cheap branches are mostly convenient.  But there's _so many_ layers, and nothing (that I've yet discovered) that lays it out in a manner that makes it easy to understand.<p>I've a lot of past experience with Subversion.  I used SVK for a while, so I could get local dev branches and commits without pushing to the central repository.  But git continually confuses me.  Plenty of it is un-learning other VCSs (no, to get rid of that mistaken change, I don't revert the file, I checkout the file.  revert is a command but it does wholly other things.)

I had no idea the extent of difficulties I would face. The hardest thing was getting the ""buyers"" - i.e. the employers - to advertise. The ""sellers"" - the graduates & students - was a piece of cake. 1,000 users in a couple of months. But without buyers, the whole thing was for naught.\nThe other thing I noticed in the ""marketplace"" business model is that the leader is able to reinforce their market position and take the lion's share of the market. It's very difficult you're up against a competitor like that but if you're establishing yourself to be the leader and succeed, it's extremely profitable.

1336685,comment,1336406,1336406,0,0,davidkpham,,,"Hey Erik,<p>Congratulations on the launch! It is a very aesthetically pleasing web design. Seeing the product kind of gives me an itch to start gardening :)<p>Here's some general feedback I had:<p>1. Instead of ""SproutRobot tells you when to plant & sends you seeds,"" how about an even more general statement, like ""We'll give you everything you need (to grow your own groceries)!"" I feel as if the current statement limits your what your product does in people's perceptions. Personally, the main reason I don't garden is because I'd have to do a lot of initial work. If you positioned yourself as making the initial work a lot easier, I'm sure a lot more people would be encouraged to sign up. Sure, gardening may mainly be knowing when to garden and having the seeds, but I think most people perceive that there's a lot more to it than that - of course your product will change that :)<p>2. Why not change the ""Get Started"" button to ""Get Started, It's Free!"" and remove the small banner underneath it that says ""It's free to sign up!"" I like the button, and I think it's one of the more prominent features on the page, so why not use it to induce trial by incentivizing clicking on it?<p>3. I also agree with one of the comments above me talking about how the actual sign-up page is a bit wordy. While having illustrations like you mentioned would certainly help, you should try to greatly shorten the sentences. It made me think it would take too long to read the page.<p>4. Sorry for jumping around, but on the homepage, you should also put in some client-side validation to ensure that the zip code field is already filled in before they click ""Get Started!"" Receiving that error page would be enough to discourage me from continuing.<p>Other than that, I'm liking the website. I can't comment too much on the actual product itself because I haven't tried it out yet, but I will certainly give you my feedback when I do.<p>Thanks,\nDavid",1273546054

1336682,comment,1336371,1336624,0,0,johnswamps,,,"But these fluctuations are often just noise. Having a glass of water before you step on the scale isn't going to help you lose or gain weight, but it still shows up on the scale. You're just micro-managing things that don't matter on this point. And then are just some things you can't control. If you have bowel movements at the same time every day, then that's not an issue; but if you go at different times every day (or not even every day), you might register as having gained two pounds one morning, when in fact you ate at a caloric deficit the day before.<p>But if you are going to weigh yourself every morning, keep this in mind and try to keep the exact same conditions every morning. Do it at the same time every day, either eat breakfast before weighing yourself every time or after every time, etc., otherwise you'll be worrying about changes in weight that don't mean anything.",1273546032

Start with ""User Stories"", or things you want the software to do for your users.<p>2. Assign each story a difficulty (""Story Points"").<p>3. Work in iterations (""Sprints"") of two weeks or so.<p>4. Your total accomplishment is the Story Points of the User Stories you complete, and your productivity (""Velocity"") is story points completed per sprint.<p>I didn't think this was a good system, as difficulty varies with experience and tools, and so if you're more productive new stories will be assigned smaller story point values.  So you're really only measuring how hard you work, rather than the value you create.<p>Maybe they use lines of code in other forms of agile.",1273545136

Alexandria Neonakis?<p>Thirdly, I too looked for a pricing plan page - to figure out how you were going to make money. When I entered a zip code, then I discovered the pricing page. It looks too wordy. Try to find a more concise way to display that same information. It kinda looks a BIT confusing, maybe it is psychological because the columns for each of the plans are not the same height. I don't understand how the height for each of the columns is decided because the $19.99 & $69.99 columns are the same, the free plan is shortest and the recommended plan is the longest. So something about that display is a bit off-putting/confusing.<p>Also, have I told you I really love the artwork of the people planting. Love it! As a result of that artwork being so nice, the pricing page feels so bland. The copy is just black text on white columns with an awesome background. Maybe you can try using a little whitespace, and then adding a few other design elements to the columns.<p>Maybe I am just nit-picking, but the headings for the columns have the word garden, except for the email one...consistency is lacking. I would add a small graphic for each of the gardens, each one getting more 'lush' as the plan increases in cost. Then change the name of the 'email only' to something more inline with the theme.

I'm assuming there aren't any images small enough, or something...to which I'd suggest you cut out the ""sprout Robot Beta"" in the top left, and let it be its own image...seamless enough on the website, but adding an image to facebook...which could help a great deal.",1273543483

I want the entire box to be a click target, and give me a mouse-over subtle color change. I also want pictures there.<p>The checkout page is very weak. A little javascript to count down how many vegetables I have left and gray things out when I don't have any options would be nice. The current plan upgrade link was sloppy-feeling. I also don't like ""Oops! We need a little more info. Could you fix the following things?"" ..it made me feel like I screwed up, when I think I followed the obvious path through the application. I'd be tempted to split out the joy of choosing what plants I'm going to get from actually paying for things. Also consider making the username the same as the email address, less to remember.<p>Come to think of it, after I choose a plan, a page where I romped through (conceptually) a bunch of awesome-looking fruits and veggies, dreaming about my awesome garden, with a form down at the bottom that says ""where do you want us to send your tasty, tasty carrots, beets, and celery?"". Then the address capture is about where my goodies are going, not paying...<p>This website is a great idea. I wish I had space to plant things, I'd give you a shot.",1273543342
