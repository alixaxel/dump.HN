Facebook status updates. Not even structured events, even though Facebook just made creating the latter much easier.<p>So we pivoted. The new incarnation was: \nDiscover events through taste makers.<p>This -we thought- allowed us to short circuit the ""I don't have enough friends on the service"" argument. So now you can follow people who share your cultural interests and discover events through them so that you can drag your friends along.<p>This newest incarnation is too hard to distribute.
