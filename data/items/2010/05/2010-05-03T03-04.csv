1313873,comment,1313679,1313679,0,0,chime,,,"For those who haven't dug into the audio analysis and synthesis field, it is really hard to understand why speech recognition is so complex. As living beings, we interpret sounds in a fundamentally different way than computers. Our brain has the ability to interpret sound-waves and provide meaning and context to them without us even realizing it. Once you hear a cat's meow, even if it happens in a different frequency range later, you can still associate it as a cat's meow.<p>This is what computers ""hear"": <a href=""http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/images/waveform.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ling.ed.ac.uk/images/waveform.gif</a> - in fact, this is ALL they can hear. When you hear 44.1khz, audio, that is 44100 bytes of information (a value between -128 to +127 per byte) per second. There is no hidden metadata behind the waveform. At 100% zoom-level, the waveform IS the audio. Theoretically, you can take a screenshot of a 100% zoomed waveform and convert that to actual sound with absolutely no loss of data (of course, you'd need a really high resolution to show a graph 44100x256 pixels in size. Now given such a waveform, how would you convert that to plain-text?<p>As an example, try recording ""ships"" and ""chips"" into a mic and view the waveform. See if there are any patterns you can identify between the two waveforms. I've done it over a hundred times. There isn't an easy way to discern if the letter was ""sh"" or ""ch"". Yet our brain does it so very easily thousands of times every day. So, failing easy pattern recognition, we have to use frequency analysis, DFT, and tons of AI.<p>My unscientific gut-feeling is that we're going about all of this the wrong way. We are using the wrong tools. Discrete, digital computers will never be able to tackle problems like pattern recognition in their current state. Switching to analog isn't going to improve anything either. I don't know what the correct instruments/devices will be but I know programming them will be very different.",1272857346

1313866,comment,1313075,1313759,0,0,nostrademons,,,"> Kind of like the incentive people have when evaluating electronics, which are under consistent, massive deflation thanks to technological progress? Not such a problem there, is it?<p>People put off electronics purchases all the time because of price deflation.  How many times have you heard people wait until the next Macworld before buying things from Apple, or wait and see what the next Android phone will be before buying anything?<p>It's not really a problem for the electronics industry because electronics is a robust and growing industry anyway.  So people spend less than they otherwise would, but nobody cares because they're still spending more (on electronics) than they used to.<p>That growth is because electronics is a substitute for several other old economy goods.  What's good for the iPad and the Kindle certainly isn't good for the publishing industry.  It <i>is</i> good for the consumer and the economy, because it encourages people to switch away from more resource/labor-intensive, less useful goods like books, and towards less resource/labor-intensive, more useful goods like tablet PCs.<p>You can't apply the same logic to the level of the whole economy, because (by definition) there's nothing for the consumer to switch to.  Price deflation across the <i>whole</i> economy means that the consumer is encouraged to switch away from goods and into cash.  But cash itself is non-productive; it has no utility for anyone beyond a means of purchasing other, more productive goods.<p>Whenever you get confused about macro/micro effects, it's helpful to forget money entirely and look at what people actually <i>do</i>.  When prices drop for computers, people switch away from other goods and buy more computers, which, assuming computers are more efficient to manufacture, is good for the economy.  When prices drop across the economy, there's nothing for people to switch to, except cash, and cash is <i>not</i> good for the economy or the consumer.<p>> An incentive driven by seeking greater return. In your world, wouldn't everyone invest in the bond market, or buy annuities, rather than the riskier stock market? Doesn't exactly gel with reality, does it?<p>""My world"" doesn't actually care whether people purchase bonds or stocks or real estate.  It abstracts those away and assumes the relative asset mix and risk preferences will be the same.  The only difference is that the rate of return for holding <i>cash</i> has gone up, and hence some percentage of the people who otherwise would've purchased stocks or bonds or real estate will instead hold cash.  Because they now hold cash instead of stocks/bonds/real estate, they have no incentive to improve (""invest in"") the businesses represented by those stocks or bonds.<p>> What does lowering the money supply do, pray tell? Wouldn't that increase the value of the dollars remaining in the system? That's deflation, by definition. How can it be both your solution and your problem?<p>No.  That's a decrease in the money supply, by definition.  (Some people define inflation as a change in the money supply, but such definitions are highly unorthodox, and can't describe phenomena like the 2008 deflation, where the money supply increased sharply yet prices fell.)<p>Over time, as people's expectations adjust, a rise in the money supply will tend to lead to inflation and a fall will lead to deflation.  But before you get full-blown deflation, you're going to get <i>disinflation</i>, where prices are still inflating but at a slower rate.  That was the situation during Volcker's ""shock therapy"" in the 1981-82 recession: the money supply contracted, the contraction squeezed the inflation rate down to something manageable, but then the contraction was reversed before prices could actually start falling.<p>> We'll speak more clearly if we aren't so broadly. Natural deflation is not static, but a force dynamically determined by facts of the economy, such as the growth in productive output.<p>Agreed.<p>> For natural deflation, little investment -> less growth in productive output -> little deflation -> more incentive to invest. Likewise for the converse: lots of investment -> more deflation -> less incentive to invest. This dynamic interplay is a self-regulating force which serves to naturally counteract the market propensity to go off the rails on some wasteful bubble or other.<p>Somewhat agreed.  This, empirically, seems to be the case when deflation is minor and the economy is hovering near equilibrium.<p>It does not appear to be the case when there is a sudden shock to the system.  For example, a financial panic increases the demand for hard currency, which pushes up the value of currency (deflation), which encourages people to hoard even more currency, which causes still more deflation.  In theory, this should be self-limiting when entrepreneurs realize that assets are available for bargain-basement prices, then buy them (without credit, otherwise they're at the mercy of fickle creditors) to put to use in new industries.  In practice, there's good evidence that it can last a decade or more.  It only takes one bad 4-year term to unseat a modern democracy, so policymakers have a strong incentive to not let things get so bad for so long.",1272857063
