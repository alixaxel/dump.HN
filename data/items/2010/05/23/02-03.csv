I felt the first whiff of their professionalism when computer ate my online electronic visa application, and the consulate in D.C. gave me a hand-signed ""Pass"" into Australia few hours before my flight. Second time was when I was renewing my visa, the clerk found out I had 3 days left, of which 2 were weekend days; she escorted me out of the line into an express booth and everything was sorted out. Can't wait to return here in 2 months and for my immigration papers to get approved. I am eager to call it home, what not with an aussie mrs.<p>FWIW, fellow yanks should google Australian ""COPS"" type shows, where they show police arresting criminals, etc. It's a laughable joke! I have seen drunks and thieves abuse, spit and attack police officers. In the U.S. that would mean a one way ticket to the operating room, and if you're lucky to make it out alive, a prison cell.",1274583524

1371636,comment,1371436,1371436,0,0,Tichy,,,"Fragmentation killed J2ME development for me. It was impossible to keep doing it as an Indie, because you needed to test your app on hundreds of devices.<p>So I worry a lot about this aspect for Android, but I have some hopes that it won't become as much of an issue.<p>The main reason is that all Android phones still have the same software basis. They have the same virtual machine and so on (except for the OS versions, but there won't be hundreds that soon). So the issue of having different bugs on every phone should be greatly reduced.<p>Another thing I hope is that it will be easier to do refunds, so I would worry less about pissing off customers when my app doesn't work on their phone. (I don't actually know how refunds work for Androids, but there must be a way?).<p>With the most common payment channel for J2ME apps, premium SMS, it was very difficult to do refunds. Typically you would only learn what phone the customer has after he sent the SMS, by which point it would have been to late to tell him that the app won't actually work for him.<p>Anyway, I just decide to be optimistic about Android for now.",1274583235

What she didn't realize is that English has something similar but we don't recognize it for indicating formality -- often as a class or education signal, or to use differently depending on audience.<p>I was confused but she explained...<p>Most English words of German origin are vulgar or informal, while most of Latin, Greek or French origin are formal. Like ""shit"" vs. ""feces"", ""fight"" vs. ""quarrel"", ""drink"" vs. ""imbibe"", etc. In general, where we have synonyms, and those synonyms can be ranked on a scale of informal to formal, German words are towards the informal end, and romantic origin words are towards the formal end.<p>She said it's been one of the hardest things to learn when learning English (and she's quite fluent), is this concept of ""formal"" English vs. ""informal"" that is separate from ""colloquial"", mainly because nobody recognizes it and nobody teaches it.<p>So apparently this is also something one has to learn in English - word origin, in order to gauge proper usage.",1274582577

If you're watching it on an iPod or iPhone then that's the only profile they support. In other words Android phones will have better maximum quality video than Apple's. Is that part getting overlooked somehow?<p>""Better"" doesn't mean ""much better""; a better residual coder is useful, but H.264 has better reference frame system - On2 seems to love idiosyncratic systems which aren't as good - and much more flexible adaptive quantization. Which is the basis of x264's psy optimizations, so the same (fundamentally good) ideas probably can't be implemented as well.<p>> It's only a matter of time and at least the Xiph guys have experience of doing exactly this on a similar codebase and they've been working on VP8 for weeks already.<p>IIRC Theora barely implemented rate-distortion optimizations in the first place, let alone Psy-RD - you have to get that out of the way before you can do the really interesting things.\nHowever, I don't think VP8 uses the weird Hilbert coding of the older system, so it might be easier to implement all of that.

1371576,comment,1370847,1371297,0,0,pjscott,,,"Not so! There's one thing you can do with skip lists that I don't know of any easy way to do with other data structures. Suppose you want a priority queue, and you have a bunch of cores, and these cores want to insert into the queue and remove the minimum element concurrently. How do you implement this to allow fast concurrent access from a lot of threads?<p>First, there's the approach everybody remembers from Intro to Algorithms: use a binary min-heap. It's guaranteed to be balanced, so you get O(lg n) time insertions and delete-the-minimum operations, with low constant factors. Nice! But how do you make it concurrent? You can put a lock on the whole thing and only let one thread use it at once, but that's slow. You could use fancy fine-grained locking, but there will still be inter-thread memory conflicts arising from the heapify operations you need to maintain the heap invariant. There has been some work on this, and they've come up with some decent ideas, but it still has scaling problems.<p>Now look at skip lists. It's a randomized sorted list data structure, and it claims to be, as you put it, probably pretty balanced. Various threads can insert concurrently without breaking that ""probably pretty balanced"" property. The memory read- and write-sets are very local, and it's possible to do all this with lock-free synchronization. The end result is a priority queue data structure that scales to hundreds of cores. And the code doesn't fry your brain, which is a plus. There's a pretty neat paper about it here:<p><a href=""http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~itayl/ipdps.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~itayl/ipdps.pdf</a><p>By the way, if you happen to be using a processor with hardware transactional memory support (you aren't, yet), then this code becomes even easier to write, as you don't have to worry about how to do lock-free synchronization. I almost felt cheated by how simple it was.",1274581109

1371566,comment,1371171,1371488,0,0,VanL,,,"Hmm, I will have to go back and review what I said to see if I misspoke. The basic issue is that open source licenses are copyright licenses, and so their enforceability is tied to the scope of copyright. The scope of copyright as applied to software is not at all clear, despite what anyone will tell you. And, probably not surprisingly, a lot of the ambiguity around the scope of copyright comes from the use of interfaces, APIs, and methods of linking. Python, like any dynamic language, is fuzzy around the boundaries here.<p>There are so many square pegs and round holes that anytime someone says something is ""clearly"" a derivative work, that person is almost certainly incorrect. The concepts of copyright were never meant to apply directly to software, and the law doesn't work the way people frequently intuitively think it does.<p>The problem is that applying copyright (and patent, but thats another story) restrictions to software has broad implications for what you can do with the software. This isn't just a practical issue; it is a freedom issue in the Free Software sense. I see so many bogus claims each day about IP that I have become very wary of its scope.<p>For example, a couple years ago Blizzard was able to get an injunction against another company because the other company sold a program that scripted Blizzard's software. No modification, just GUI automation. I was horrified, and disagreed, but they were able to put together a winning argument.<p>I unabashedly advocate boundaries on copyright. I think authors should say where they consider their code to end, and other code to begin. I think those boundaries should be reasonable within the scope of the law. I think this principle applies even (or especially) when it is free or open source software.",1274580743
