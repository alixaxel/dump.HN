What is a good boardgame which has<p>(1) rich tactics\n(2) does not need ""memorizing openings"" type efforts to be good at or where such strategies don't work.\n(3) is easy to set up and play (4) has some online community<p>I don't pay chess these days for much the same reasons as jacquesm. Miniature wargames are fun but a bear to setup and tear down. Most popular boardgames aren't very rich tactically, mostly dependent on luck/die rolls  etc.<p>I guess Go would be a good choice but I can't get anyone to play with here and/or teach me some interesting tactics :-|.

I thought I knew the basics of how to use them, and have used them in the little bit of Haskell I have written, but that makes no sense at all to me.<p>What are the apples and oranges supposed to represent? Why would anyone want to put oranges in the spacesuit? When ""you just take what you need"", who is the ""you"", and are they swimming around in the ocean? Is the ocean significant at all?<p>I might be wasting my time trying to understand this analogy. I'm not up to speed on terms Haskellers throw around such as fields, rings, category theory, etc. Haskellers are welcoming of newbies and eager to teach, but are on a vastly different level than the average developer causing some of us to feel we're not smart enough to wield Haskell. Unfortunately even some basic concepts are so abstract that trying to explain them in concrete terms often leads to gibberish such as dons' analogy there.<p>I realize dons probably wrote that for the monad-savvy crowd as kind of an inside joke, perhaps I'd do well to just move on.",1274587091

The key to solving this one is just to get the MIDI data into the Windows MIDI mapper system.<p>If you have access to the app source you should be able to rewrite the code to use DirectSound or FluidSynth to play MIDI rather than touch the serial port.<p>If not, two dirty-hack options come to mind: you can loop the serial line's output back into the computer with a USB MIDI device(classically, MIDI goes over a 9-pin connection, presumably you already have a solution for serial-to-9-pin with the original setup) or you might be able to poll outgoing serial traffic and remap it with some code.",1274586812

1371737,comment,1371598,1371598,0,0,patio11,,,"Ruby is a programing language.  Ruby on Rails is a web framework.  That is not a pointy-headed distinction, because the reason Rails is vastly superior to regular ol' PHP for certain types of prototyping tasks is because of all the stuff it has built <i>on top of</i> Ruby.  For example, ActiveRecord, which will save you from having hard-coded SQL calls in the middle of your prototype.<p>There is a certain amount of conceptual overhead which happens with Rails projects that doesn't happen with PHP.  Deploying Rails apps is still an order of magnitude or more harder than doing PHP apps -- even with Passenger, which supposedly fixed deployment.  There will almost certainly be more configuration in a Rails app.<p>On the plus side, the Rails and Ruby communities have <i>wide and deep</i> amounts of OSS code for you to use to accomplish typical web dev tasks.  The PHP community is, ahem, well, I'm sure they're wonderful people and if you're working <i>on Wordpress</i> they have huge amounts of well-packaged code available for you to use to accomplish your tasks.<p>You don't mention if you're a programmer already.  PHP is well-suited to folks with minimal programming ability.  I would think doing Rails without having strong object oriented programming skills would be a recipe for disaster.",1274586484

You are right, there are different degrees of immune system response w/r to IgE response. But no IgE? Not allergic -- probably intolerant -- <i>may</i> have something else.<p>Lots of things people say/think they are allergic to, they are actually intolerant of.<p>I'm not putting down Dangerous Grains, only cautioning that many people improperly self-diagnose. The authors are recognized practitioners in allergy medicine. I forget some of the the terms off-hand, but mistaken self-diagnosis when learning about new medical topics is sometimes called the ""medical school student syndrome"".<p>Just because many of the easily observable symptoms of Coeliac disease are commonly found in any random selection of population, does not mean that Coeliac disease is common. It doesn't help that most of the symptoms may or may not even be present!<p>But really here's the list of symptoms: Abdominal pain, Abdominal distention, bloating, gas, indigestion, Constipation, Decreased appetite (may also be increased or unchanged), Diarrhea -- chronic or occasional, Lactose intolerance (common upon diagnosis, usually goes away following treatment), Nausea and vomiting, Stools that float, are foul smelling, bloody, or “fatty”, unexplained weight loss (although people can be overweight or of normal weight upon diagnosis), Anemia (low blood count), Bone and joint pain, Bone disease (osteoporosis, kyphoscoliosis, fracture), Breathlessness (due to anemia), Bruising easily, Dental enamel defects and discoloration, Depression, Fatigue, Growth delay in children, Hair loss, Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), Irritability and behavioral changes, Malnutrition, Mouth ulcers, Muscle cramps, Nosebleed, Seizures, Short stature, unexplained Skin disorders (dermatitis herpetiformis)\nSwelling, general or abdominal, Vitamin or mineral deficiency, single or multiple nutrient (for example, iron, folate, vitamin K), Type-1 diabestes, autoimmune thyroid disease, autoimmune liver disease, rheumatoid arthritis, addison's disease, sjogren's syndrome.<p>Almost everybody I know has half of these symptoms half of the time -- and the ones that are less common are from something that's not CD (hair loss? how about Rad poisoning. Short children? Pituitary irregularity. Mouth ulcers? How about being a skank in High School?)<p>Here, let's try some example differentials: \nPatient is 28, Female, Caucasian, blood pressure is normal, pulse is normal, height and weight are average.\nSymptoms: Anemic, Bloating, Constipated, Abdominal Pain, Nausea and vomiting, Bruising easily, Fatigue, irritability and behavioral changes, muscle cramps, swelling, vitamin D and Calcium deficiency in lab work.<p>Does she have a) Lupus? b) PMS? c) or one of the .5% of the adult population with CD? (hint, it's never Lupus).<p>How about this:\nPatient is 62, Female, Caucasian, BP is elevated, pulse is elevated, height is below average and weight are average.\nSymptoms: Anemic, Indigestion, Occasional Diarrhea, Bone and Joint Pain, Bone disease (osteoporosis), Bruises easily, Dental discoloration, Fatigue, Hair loss, Hypoglycemia, Malnutrition, Short Stature, unexplained, Hives, Vitamin and mineral deficiency.<p>Does she have a) Lupus? b) Old, eats a crap diet of mostly snack foods, works a high stress sedentary job and drinks lots of coffee and tea and just starting eating a high fiber diet for the first time in her life? c) one of the .5% of the adult population with CD?<p>Or let's try another:\nPatient is 34, Male, Caucasian, BP is normal, pulse is elevated, height is average, weight is above average.\nSymptoms: Thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, fatigue, vomiting, foul smelling stools, diarrhea, irritability, nosebleeds, vitamin and mineral deficiency.<p>Does he have a) Lupus? b) Has hereditary Grave's disease, is fat, eats a crap diet of pizza, candy and Jolt, has poor social skills, and just ate a bad piece of three day old pepperoni and we should check to see if he has sepsis and swab for known food-borne pathogens? c) one of the .5% of the adult population with CD?<p>My point is that the observable presentation symptoms for CD are crap. They could be symptoms for anything. Hence the caution on self-diagnosis. It also doesn't mean people should go out of their way to inconvenience themselves to avoid grain products and food with gluten in it because they get bloated on occasion or have stinky poo.<p><a href=""http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/</a> <i>""Diagnosis involves blood tests and, in most cases, a biopsy of the small intestine.""</i>",1274586470

1371707,comment,1371064,1371064,0,0,tptacek,,,"Like everything else, when and how much to talk to the police is a judgement call.<p>I am quite possibly the world's least legal driver; I've spent more of my adult license with a suspended license than a legitimate one. Not only that, but I drive around with expired plates. In one case, very, very expired plates. From a different state. And I drive a pretty consistent 10MPH over the limit.<p>And yet I very rarely get tickets. Because I am (I think) good at not antagonizing cops. For instance, here is a trick that works <i>very reliably</i> for me: when driving on the highway, if I see a cruiser pull out onto the road from a trap or the median, I pull over preemptively --- before the lights come on. They say, ""why'd you pull over"", I say ""I figure you pulled out like that because I did something wrong"", and they say ""drive slower next time"".<p>Similarly: dome light on, car engine off, hands on the wheel, window (mostly) down. ""Got any weapons in the car""? That's a question I'm happy to answer.<p>I think the thing people don't realize is that most people are total assholes to police officers. Just being civil puts you in the top 10th percentile of their clientele. I'd rather be civil (and, for my neighborhood cops, <i>helpful</i>) than self-righteous.<p>Another thing, after reading the ACLU guides, watching the videos, and reading the books: you have rights, but you have no <i>authority</i> over the police. You usually have a constitutional right to be free from search without probable cause. But that does <i>not</i> mean you can prevent an unreasonable search; it merely means you're likely to win a case that hinges on evidence obtained from that search.<p>If you're an iota less than civil to a cop who's having a bad day, he'll arrest you. That's pretty much the ballgame. Your day is ruined. Find a friendly, polite, <i>short</i> way to avoid discussing incriminating topics with the police. Say, ""sorry, I don't consent to searches"" and, if pressed, ""I'm really sorry, this is just a thing with me, but I'm not going to consent to a search; is there anything else I can do to help?"". But <i>do not</i> say ""My life might hang in the balance if I allow you to search me"". You're just going to get arrested, and then immediately searched anyways.<p>Finally: <i>none of these things apply near the border</i>. You have essentially no rights near the border.",1274585615
