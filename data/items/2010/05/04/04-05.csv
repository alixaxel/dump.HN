(I really don't care if anyone sees the things I put on Facebook).<p>I initially chose NOT to link any of my profile interests to their respective pages. I have no problem giving Facebook data for their open graph project; my fear was that I would soon be inundated with dozens of news feed items from all of my interests' Pages. So I unchecked all the items that had been on my profile for several years, thinking that they would still be displayed as simple text (as opposed to links).<p>Instead, they were all deleted! So I took some time to (partially) rebuild my list of interests as links, only to then of course witness the flood of news items posted by those pages. I have been 'hiding' them as they show up.

Your speculation that it could be used in safari, presumably for squirrelfish, is about as unfounded as the assertion that ecma is plotting a coup by switching from is to ecma.. if you have links to the contrary, ill be happy to eat my hat, not to mention learn how llvm is useful in this space.<p>also, to understand just how much fun llvm can be, take a look at unladen swallow.. there are major RAM and binary size bloat issues without the corresponding speed increases, currently.

It's a tiny number.<p>Apparently this is why it is so hard to define what is actually causing cancer and what isn't.

Only one node is working on a query a time, while synchronizing access to resources at a physical level.<p>Clustrix is fundamentally different. We compile the query down into query fragments and evaluate relevant portions of the query at the node which holds the relevant data. We bring the query to the data.<p>You can find more specifics on our architecture in our white paper:<p><a href=""http://www.clustrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/clustrix-whitepaper-01-no-on-sql-mysql-object-key-value-store-database-scaling.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clustrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/clustrix-...</a><p>Clustrix is all about concurrency and parallelism.

Most people would rather not deal with the added complexity.<p>In a typical sharding scheme, one would choose a partition key (typically some primary key, e.g. user id) and use that as a distribution strategy. At such granularity, hot spots are a common problem. In Clustrix, we have independent distribution/partitioning for each table/index, down to the row level. To get hot spots is if you contend on a single row -- but that's really an indication of something going terribly wrong in the data model.<p>ACID (transactional properties) and KV (data model) are orthogonal concepts.

1317049,comment,1316865,1316865,0,0,jerf,,,"I'm underwhelmed. The reason we build our programs that way is that actually makes them <i>less</i> likely to crash. We actually have access to programs structured more like the E. Coli graph. They crash a lot. Because the fact that one error takes down the whole system has less to do with the organizational structure of the code, and more to do with the fact that we've deliberately built the system such that one error will crash the entire system... because the alternative is worse. There's no recovering from a segfault not because there aren't enough different implementations of core functionality, but because there is no sensible way to recover from a segfault.<p>Cells have a type of redundancy programs do not have, and may never have, and it actually hasn't got anything to do with the source code at all. They have numerous independent copies of things that mostly work, most of the time. They perform tasks that transform lots of things into lots of other things, most of the time. The whole system is built so that everything mostly works, most of the time, usually recovers, and it doesn't matter much whether this cell dies or that mitochondria malfunctions. It's an entirely different set of primitives brought on by massive parallelism. (And not the usual biological parallelism you hear about in the brain, but physically, everywhere.)<p>It's the difference in primitives that brings about the difference in result. Difference in optimal layout is an <i>effect</i>, not a <i>cause</i>. Cells don't have the option to work like programs, and programs really don't have the option to work like cells. (At least not without a lot more computational resources.)",1272946673
