I mean in the sense that even non-techy users can look at google and say ""wow these guys have changed the world"". Or even at the very least, ""hey cool, I found it"".<p>Doesn't that brand affection count for something?<p>I have never met a non-techy user express love for facebook in the sense that it was doing anything special or even worthwhile. To them it's just yet another way to talk to their friends. Sure it may be the best way, but the perception is that its just a damned messaging interface. A cool contact book. I don't know.<p>Personally as a more tech-savy user, I <i>love</i> google. They have done <i>so much good</i> it makes it hard for me to get upset with them over privacy issues; so many things become pretty trivial. Google made information <i>easily</i> accessible to the entire world. They liberated costly video media by taking on youtube's ridiculously non-sustainable business model. They run goog-411! <3. Google maps is the best, google mail is the best, with google docs i can say goodbye to bloat-ware to write a freaking essay. There's google scholar, google translate, google code, ... they don't have to do any of these things, much less make them freely accessible and zero-cost for the entire world. Oh yeah, then theres little teeny tiny google.org<p>Man I love google, they can have my information anytime they want it. <3<p>Thanks google!<p>So my point is people can say xyz company is the next Google killer all they want. They can say feature is X is going to turn the tides. But really, perceived brand awareness/trust/loyalty <i>does</i> count for something. Does facebook even have a charity arm?",1272938290

Sure, some people don't care about being seen naked, but a lot of people do and this is a deeply embarrassing and unpleasant experience that will stay with them for a long time.<p>Members of my family have been left stranded in a foreign country when an airline refused to carry them because one of them asked why he was required to show the same documents for the third time in rapid succession. (The airline's excuse for this absurdly disproportionate response changed so many times afterwards it was hard to keep track, and I won't say any more because as far as I'm aware legal action for compensation is still pending.)<p>Hundreds of people from my country have recently been held in hotels under armed guard because after a diversion to a different country's airport due to the ash problems, they obviously didn't have visas, so they couldn't even get a train home. I'm not sure why anyone in a country these people never wanted or expected to visit would consider them such a security threat that they couldn't leave and had to be held at gunpoint, but there you go.<p>These things are not trivial, and I don't think a single one of those people would consider objecting to this sort of security theatre ""being silly"".<p>And you fail on the ""bit in the middle"", because all the unpleasantness that I described in those earlier posts happens on a single flight.",1272935911

The political culture does have some significant differences, but the people are more similar than not.  If education works better in Canada than it does in the USA (my experience and international comparisons suggest that it does), then it can work better in the USA as well.<p>On the religious point, that may be a real factor in the difference.  I ran across the one figure in <i>The Homework Myth</i> but don't have the level of detail to break down private schools by type.  Another factor that I suspect is that there is a large gap between the factors that parents will see as quality, and factors that actually affect student learning.  Private schools that offer a lot of extracurriculars and make good presentations to parents will attract investment, whether or not the students are truly getting a quality education.<p>Personally if I could afford to, I would sidestep the whole mess and home-school.
