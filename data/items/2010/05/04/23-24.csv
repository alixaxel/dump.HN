The followup (you mean <a href=""http://daringfireball.net/2009/08/phil_schiller_app_store"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daringfireball.net/2009/08/phil_schiller_app_store</a>, right?) has Gruber saying that he still thinks it's wrong to put a 17+ rating on a dictionary for having Naughty Words in it, and that he doesn't think the person who rejected the Ninjawords dictionary acted (1) wisely or (2) consistently with Apple's policy as described to him by Phil Schiller.<p>(He did say that Apple weren't as wrong as he'd thought they were, because he'd thought they insisted that the Ninjawords dictionary be both (1) censored and (2) marked 17+, whereas supposedly that turned out not to have happened.)<p>Anyway, I'm not sure what your point about the followup really is. Gruber said something very uncomplimentary about Apple's handling of App Store applications in this particular case (most outrageous yet, hard to do worse) and in general (clear implication of lots of earlier strikingly outrageous rejections). Therefore, he is not uniformly uncritical of Apple. -- Unless you're suggesting that he said that with the intention of issuing a retraction to make Apple look <i>even better</i>, and that his later comment wasn't (as he claimed) precipitated by getting an email from Phil Schiller responding to what he'd said?<p>Don't get me wrong: it's clear that John Gruber is on the whole very, very enthusiastic about Apple and their products. I would not look to him for unbiased commentary on anything Apple-related. But that is not at all the same thing as being prepared to defend anything ""regardless of morality"", which is the accusation <i>heresy</i> made above and which still seems to me quite un-called-for.",1273017331

1319830,comment,1319706,1319706,0,0,colonelxc,,,"Original Blog Title: High Academic Results Make Better Programmers<p>Personal anecdote about laziness and grades:\nMy freshman year of college, I had a semester where I decided that video games were more important than school.  I got a terrible gpa, lost all my scholarships, etc.  I spent the next several years making it up.  Now I didn't quite just rebound to high 3's and 4.0's, it took a few semesters to overcome my bad habits first (3.2,3.5,etc).  Eventually I ended up with a cumulative 3.5.<p>While I do regret getting that poor of grades, it does provide some talking material for an interview (provided your lower grades don't pre-filter you).  It shows that you realized your mistakes, worked to improve yourself, and with your high junior/senior level grades, that you actually are smart enough to do the work (well, as much as college can prepare you for that).<p>So, I guess my point is that even if you have had bad grades, you still have time to prove yourself, and may even end up with interview talking points.",1273017030

1319826,comment,1319706,1319706,0,0,jswinghammer,,,"It's sort of silly to suggest that people assess someone based on grades when first meeting them (or ever). No one has ever asked me about my grades in any level of education-they're average to below average compared to my peers (2.5-3.0). Most people assume that I did very well in school because I spend a great deal of time reading about a wide variety of subjects so I tend to know a lot about whatever topic comes up at lunch or whatever.<p>I've met some people who got good grades but can't do anything useful so they go nowhere. I've met some people who make my grades look excellent and they're much more capable than I am in terms of programming skills (in my estimation at least). In my experience the ability to influence people in an organization and read people's feelings is far more important to success than grades. Even the smartest people I know whose social skills are bad tend to have problems getting where they want to go in life.<p>I assume that people who write these kinds of articles did well in school (Joel Spolsky's made this point before so I'm mostly thinking of him). I think that people who did poorly in school are less likely to write this sort of article and thus if they did I'd pay closer attention to what they're saying. These sort of statements strike me as self serving and defensive.<p>If you did well in school you played by the rules and you got your reward already. Your parents were happy with you, your teachers didn't ever give you the lecture that went like this ""If you only tried a little bit you'd be getting an A in this class"", your friends admired your achievement, etc. I'm not sure I feel any need to give you anything more than you already have received. I don't resent your success at all but it's hard for me to feel sorry for you if people notice the underachievers who made it before they notice you.",1273016961

1319823,comment,1319649,1319649,0,0,derefr,,,"The author has inadvertantly stumbled upon a part of hacker culture with wide-ranging implications, that is almost never discussed—and that is that people expect that you <i>publish</i> code because you want it to be <i>changed</i>, and not simply <i>read</i>. This stems from a deeply-rooted tradition in programming of <i>not reading a codebase until you have a problem with it that you must fix</i>. People don't ""read for pleasure"" in the programming world; they don't even read to learn—have you ever had a school assignment that charged you with reading more than 1KSLOC? The only reason, as a programmer, I will ever ""cd src/"", is that I am on a mission to fix a problem. Therefore, publishing code but reserving the right to derivative works, looks a bit like gloating, or showing off—""look what I did! Look how smart I am! It's no benefit to <i>you</i>... but look!""<p>This makes perfect sense in the art world (and writing <i>is</i> a form of art), as you never really ""derive"" from a piece of art; instead, you first look at the mechanisms by which it communicated its message to add those techniques to your repitoire of skills, and then re-use those skills on your own works. That makes perfect sense in an artistic medium, where any single stroke or word or note may be chosen from an infinitude of options—but programming requires <i>formal grammar</i>—a finite set of ways of expressing each concept—and thus there is relatively little merit in studying the technique by which a single problem was solved.<p>On a separate note, for the first few paragraphs he seems to be completely unaware of the medium of <i>fan-fiction</i>—which is about as core to ""the culture of online fiction"" as you can find.",1273016745

1319816,comment,1318916,1319658,0,0,strlen,,,">  But I still think there is truth that efficient, sustainable hours can be more productive than long, stressful hours.<p>I agree here (when I find myself working 60+ hours a week outside of rare crunch time, I am usually doing something wrong e.g., giving bad estimates or losing focus), but forcing people to work ""efficient hours"" (you <i>must</i> be in the office at 9, vs. being allowed to come in at 11 and stay until 8) is micro management (loss of autonomy).<p>Not being allowed to do (even non-user facing e.g., infrastructure) projects without permission from project management, planning meetings and daily status reports is another example of micro management. Perhaps this isn't a part of agile manifesto (just like concentration camps aren't a part of the communist manifesto), but that aspect is certainly a feature of almost all implementations of uppercase-A agile (scrum,  XP, etc...). I'm all for frequent releases, continuous integration (and possibly continuous deployment), iterative development (at least for product features) et al, but you don't need a full blown ""Agile"" process (planning meetings, daily stand-ups, index cards, bringing in training consultants, hiring ""scrum masters"", etc...) for that.<p>Work life balance is important. It's also very important to work smartly and use labour saving techniques (adequate hardware, tools/automation). Performance requires maintenance and I make sure to allocate down time (time with friends and relatives, concerts, non-technical reading, trips/vacations, exercise, etc...) to myself on a regular basis.<p>However, the most important aspects of a job (to me) are autonomy, great colleagues and challenging work (exposure to new concepts and technologies, which frequently have a learning curve). Given a choice between working a 1-2 hours more and giving up any one of these aspects, I'd gladly accept a few hours more of work.",1273016553

Preferably by example.<p>4. <i>Everyone</i> has problems.  Now that you understand that, don't let people's problems interfere with their work or nothing will ever get done.<p>5. Learn the difference between issues and details.  Focus on the issues.  Don't waste too much time on the details.  And get your team to do the same.<p>6. When all else fails, communicate.  When all else goes well, still communicate.  Never underestimate the power of communication.  You'd be surprised how much slack others will cut you if you're simply open and honest with them.<p>7. Treat everyone else the way you'd like to be treated.  (This goes for everyone, not just managers.)<p>8.  Listen at least as much as you talk.  (This also goes for everyone, not just managers.)<p>9.
