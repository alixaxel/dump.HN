1366869,comment,1366217,1366217,0,0,roel_v,,,"Many of the replies so far are more 'general life advise' answers. To me 'street smarts' is what the rich people that I know are - none of them have degrees, but they're all wealthier than the educated people like doctors, lawyers, engineers etc. around here. These are all people who run retail or wholesale businesses, small chains of Walmart-style shops, building materials, run contracting/real estate development companies, even fast food joints - that sort of thing. These people can't tell Australia from Africa if you give them a map, and none of them have ever heard about a sine or integral or Pointcare's conjecture, yet they drive Maseratis and have dozens of properties. Why did these guys succeed and others businesses fail or barely make enough to live off? That is what street smarts is to me, what these entrepreneurs have that made their businesses a success, and what others lacked.<p>Anyway in trying to identify the nature of this street smarts, I have analyzed some of these people that I know, asking them questions that are still appropriate (i.e., not straight-out asking them about money) and don't make me look like a weirdo as much as I could, and keeping in mind a certain sort of anti-intellectualism that many of them exhibit (and that, in some cases, has paid off very well for them). I recognize that my thought processes are so far away from theirs that it's very easy to fall back into cargo-cult imitation, but still, I think that a large part of their success is in their deal-making capabilities. This breaks apart in two phases: phase one is connecting to the right people, phase two is making the actual, concrete deal.<p>Phase 1 is facilitated by having a large network, just knowing many people, and this is done by being a person that people want to be around with - be a nice guy, but not a pushover, be confident, dominant without being an asshole, and be in general nice to be around. This is a hard challenge to me, it isn't easy to get to know as many people as possible, letting them know what you do and finding out what they do, and making that all happen naturally. E.g. it's easy to 'meet' random people by chatting them up in the supermarket - but how will you tell them what business you're in? Smalltalk about the weather will only get you so far, how do you (efficiently, i.e. without turning them into full-blown friends with the associated time investment) get them to the point where they remember you as the go-to guy in your line of business, or get them to the point where you can call them when you need something, so that you always have an 'acquaintance' for whatever you need, who you can call?<p>Then there is phase 2, which can basically be summed up by ""at any point in any any negotiation, you need to remain willing to drop everything and just walk away"". This means being very aware of cognitive biases such as loss aversion etc. You have to be tough as nails here - be on friendly terms with people, so that they want to help you out, yet not exploit them because that will blow your relationship with them. You have to get people to a point where they are <i>happy</i> if they can do you a favor.<p>This is already getting too long, but let me share with you one (in my opinion) example of 'street smarts' that the Belgian and German readers will recognize: the soccer keeper (goalie) Jean-Marie Pfaff. He used to be the keeper for the Belgian national team, he also played for Bayern Munchen in the 90's I think. Anyway he has a reality TV show now, his daughters are models and kinda famous so they all ride the tails of his fame now, kinda like Hulk Hogan.<p>Anyway like I said, he has this reality TV show. In one episode, and this really struck me, there was a guy who was living in the same village as Jean-Maria and he came to the door of his villa, rang the bell and dropped off a bag of potatoes. Not ordered or anything, he had just harvested, has potatoes, and thought to drop off this bag. He was so eager to please this rich/famous guy that he'd out of nowhere brought him a 3 euro bag of potatoes. That, to me, means that this Pfaff guy has street smarts - he manages to be so likable that people that they do thing they'd not do for others.",1274435148

Doesn't give either of them a free pass in other areas.<p>Something that annoyed me for a long time as an Apple user was that people would criticize them very strongly for the wrong things, while ignoring, not understanding or actively embracing them when they did bad stuff. It seemed to be the wrong kind of feedback loop. (The absolute roasting they got from Mac developers when they suggested web apps were the future being a good example).<p>For an example of a Google faux pas, they're crowdsourcing map data in the developing world and then keeping the data proprietary.<p>If we can't give feedback about companies at any granularity lower than loving or hating the whole company then we're in trouble as an industry (and sadly that often seems to be the case).",1274433910
1366837,comment,1366537,1366822,0,0,SweltertheCook,,,"The problem that I have with this comment (and many of the stories like the one linked) is the simple fact that, although this is obviously a blatant attempt to re-write history via corporate PR (something that Google does just as often as any huge company), it really is true (in an overall sense-- Google certainly is attempting to avoid a future where the iPhone is dominant. Whether or not you think that's ""draconian""... well, really, stop right there. How many HN posts are there about various App Store debacles? Censorship? If it isn't ""draconian"", it is certainly less than ""free""). Google is doing something to challenge Apple here, and they are doing it in all the right ways.<p>I have a Droid, and a good friend has an iPhone. There are times when I really wish I had his phone instead of my Droid, but there are also a lot of times he wished he had an Android device. Like it or not, Apple has competition, and that's forcing them to innovate rather than letting developers do it for them via the App store. Tethering, built in MiFi-like capability-- these are things that Apple's good friends in the App store can't do for them, and Google is right to go after them. Likewise, although it is very likely I'll try to turn off/disable Flash support if my Droid is ever updated to 2.2 (or if I ever root it and go with Cyanogen, etc), it is a weakness of the iPhone, iPad, and going after Apple where it will actually hurt is more than fair game.<p>Again, I don't think giving Google a pass here (or worshipping at their temple) is a good idea per se. But I do think that a lot of the criticisms leveled at Google for this comment have less to do with Google's real sin-- PR manipulation-- and more to do with the fact that a great deal of Apple supporters are a bit chagrined that Google is doing so well against the iPhone.<p>Just look at Gruber. I mean, I love the guy-- read his site every day, as I think it is some of the best Apple analysis out there-- but as Google I/O has gone on, his normally cogent commentary has degenerated into what basically amounts to one-line (or one-paragraph) sniping over Google's attempts to challenge Apple. As if Apple somehow has the right to complete 100% dominance of the consumer smartphone market.<p>Again, like Google or not, I think its hard to argue that Android isn't a serious challenger to the iPhone (and soon the iPad, if Android-lovers have their way). And its hard to argue that this is ultimately good for consumers-- certainly much, much better than an Apple-run world where political satire is banned from our phones simply because it might ruffle a few feathers or distract from Steve Job's vision of the ""perfect"" App Store.",1274433850

Elements that you don't use don't get reset.<p>That's fine of course, but if you make a lot of websites then you really just want a common stylesheet that does everything you might need, and go from there.

I also did the overnight hackathon at Chirp, the Twitter Developer conference, last month.<p>General tips:<p>------------<p>- Make sure there's enough food & drink. It's very hard to think and keep working when you're thirsty or hungry.<p>- Second monitors for everybody involved are a must.<p>- Definitely still use version control. I've seen some people avoid this for the sake of speed but the ability to try things out and quickly recover is vital in a chaotic coding environment of a hackathon. Take the time to set it up.<p>- Don't keep things in your head for too long. It's faster to express yourself and communicate on paper. Bring LOTS of scratch paper and pencils.<p>- Take breaks unless you're in the zone. Get up, stretch out, walk around, get food, talk with others. It'll help re-energize your thinking.<p>- Don't sleep. All my hackathons were less than 24 hours and I didn't sleep. I got a good night's rest the night before I started and I stayed away from naps because it's very hard to wake up once you fall asleep.<p>- TDD is optional. If it's part of how you already code all your projects, keep at it. If you're not in the church of testing, don't bother. It will only slow you down. A hackathon is not about coverage or whether your code is well-tested, it's about whether you have code that works at all.<p>Splitting time:<p>--------------<p>- Never hesitate to stop and brainstorm, just don't let a session go on for more than 30 minutes.<p>- Leave visual design for last. My goal has always been to build something functional, not necessarily pretty or usable. I can also crank out CSS pretty quickly so I'm comfortable leaving most or all of the visual design for the very end.<p>- It's worth sketch out the flows early on. It will help guide and structure your code and other ideas. Just don't obsess over a great user experience in the beginning.<p>- Spend the vast majority of your time coding. Iterate like you've never iterated before. Hack, hack, hack, and only refactor if the latency is really bothering you. Get to something that works first and foremost, then worry about code quality, performance, readability, and all the things you're supposed to when you have more time.",1274433173
