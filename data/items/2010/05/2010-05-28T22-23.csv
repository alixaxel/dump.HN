I guess until closed time-like curves are proven to be unphysical (which seems likely), physicists will keep coming up with possible solutions to Einstein's equations which allow for CTCs (and refuting them). And who knows, maybe one of them can be implemented by humans.<p>On the other hand, it would be very interesting to know what is the mechanism by which the Universe protects itself against CTCs.",1275087414

Internet authorities, including ICANN, have enabled domains with digits in TLDs; software which is far more foundational than any web-app's email validation regex has been updated.<p>Registration of names in some of these digited-TLDs has begun; you can visit these TLDs with your browser; your users can have functioning email addresses on these TLDs.<p>If your app rejects such email addresses because of slavish compliance with imprecise language in a 31-year-old RFC, you'd be the one violating prevailing standards, which are a function of more than just formal IETF RFCs.<p>That the Internet-Draft I referenced may soon become an RFC is just cleaning up loose ends on a change that's already happened. This final step isn't even strictly necessary for the <i>de facto</i> standard to have changed by consensus among practitioners. Plenty of vibrant well-understood standards never reach RFC status, nor pass through any formal standards body.

They probably know there's no future in stripping in Moscow, but I would guess they think everybody in New York shops on Fifth Avenue, and if sex gets them that, what's the harm?<p>I think you're sadly underestimating how shocked Eastern Europeans can be when confronted with the reality of America.  <i>Especially</i> 18-year-olds.  And even if they ""knew what they were getting into"" in terms of there being sex, that <i>still</i> doesn't touch what human trafficking is about, which is a slow and steady process of degradation.  They'd give up their passports, they'd never see actual money, and the first hit of crack or heroin is always free at some rich guy's party - but pretty soon, it's not free, they're increasingly in debt, they feel trapped (and <i>are</i> trapped) and they think there's nobody in hell who will help an ugly, crack-addicted, no-longer-so-pretty woman.<p>So either you think Russians, or non-Americans, or whoever, ""know what they're getting into"" in that situation, and it's just fine, or you haven't thought it through.  I'm banking on the latter.<p>This is not a question of human intelligence.  We've all gotten into situations where a flashy fast talker got us into something that trapped us - ever had a cubicle job with a software consulting shop?  Our monkey brains <i>always</i> fall for that crap, which is why this particular story was so heartening - somebody actually stopped it before it started, and that's fantastic.<p>As I said earlier, Bingo's attitude was half humorous, half assholery - I wish he'd stopped at just the humorous half.  Sure, maybe this particular nightclub with sex ads where a mysterious guy wanted two 18-year-olds without much English to meet him at midnight for an interview after another job ""fell through"" and they were in another city <i>wasn't</i> a human trafficking situation.  Given the preponderance of flashing red flags, though, I'm damn happy we didn't give this benefactor the benefit of the doubt, even if the club itself had lots of prosperous young people attending.",1275086967
1387888,comment,1387781,1387781,0,0,tptacek,,,"If I understand this correctly, the loophole that's being closed here is a special tax rate for ""investment income"" from money that did not expose the VC's themselves to risk, but only the VC's limited partners (who provide most of the capital for venture funds).<p>In other words, the pension funds, endowments, and corporations that actually <i>provide</i> capital aren't being taxed more aggressively. The people who allocate that capital are.<p>This makes sense, doesn't it? If you invest $10,000 of your own money in a company for several years, you should rightly expect to pay the long-term capital gains rate on the returns. The tax code wants to encourage you to invest in things and drive the economy, and you did that.<p>But if I give you $10,000,000 to invest for me, and you turn it into $50,000,000, you shouldn't be getting a free ride on the millions of dollars you just made.

Here's how it would work:<p>1) Visit Diaspora.com<p>2) Install dropbox-style client.<p>3) ""Connect"" with your friends by facebook, twitter, google, oauth, email, etc.<p>4) Diaspora.com then shows all your friends files. Click ""Download"" to sync any file you want into your Diaspora folder. Any files you put in the ""Diaspora"" folder are shared with your friends.<p>5) Growl notification when a transfer completes-- open it from your Diaspora folder or play the media in-browser with the embedded VLC browser plugin.<p><i>Key Issues</i><p>* The UI would be stupidly simple-- everything happens in the browser<p>* No central index. All indexes are transparently synced P2P when both users are online.<p>* It's viral - any files you download into Diaspora folder are automatically shared with others by default.<p>* Privacy options let you limit bandwidth, restrict your friend list, etc.<p>* Embedded Web Server -- Diaspora.com would still be available offline.<p>* Embedded VLC Player -- Click ""Play"" to play media in-browser.<p>There are lots of legitimate purposes for the software. It's a like a free dropbox-- but with no central index it seems impossible to stop. The most exciting thing is that lots of normal people are now running the auto-updating ""Diaspora Personal Server"" and they don't even know it-- because it just works.",1275085413
