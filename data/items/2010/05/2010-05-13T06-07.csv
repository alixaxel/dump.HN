$1000 * 30 years @ 8% = $10,935.73
$1000 * 30 years @ 6% = $6,022.58
(10 935.73 - 6 022.58) / 10 935.73 = 0.449274991<p>The problem with most people when they go into the market is that they use a buy high sell low strategy. They buy into the market when ""it's doing well"" and sell when ""they lost their money""",1273733665

In a way you're right, and it's a massive amount of forms on top of a database, plus staggering amounts of business logic. But as it was born before the web, it does not render to HTML, but to it's own display system. Most parts are written in ABAP, an interpreted language, and the source code is stored in the database. A quite usable IDE and a debugger are included. The source code is there, so you can read it and explore how things happen.<p>There's a database abstraction layer, which works around some limitations of the underlying databases.

As another commenter wrote, investors as an aggregate <i>are</i> the market (hedgers, as another listed, are also considered, or could be considered investors who are investing for reasons other than direct belief in the individual companies/stocks).<p>2. Investment banks don't <i>need</i> to be investing. It's not their business, which is underwriting securities or acting as broker-dealers for M&A work. What we've seen in recent years are investment banks with trading divisions, but the act of investment banking is a separate business, and it's the performance of the investment banking team that should be compensating them.<p>3. You talk about option strategies, but for every move you make, say buying a call, another party had to have written the option. For individual investors, your point could still be very accurate. However, at some scale (though ridiculously large these days), this will break down.<p>That said, I do agree with your final point. An individual can beat the market.",1273733042

That said, I think there is a good way to have multiple generations under the same roof.<p>I know a guy, an executive, who lives under his parents' roof with his wife, son, and daughter. It's large enough, they eat together a lot of times, the mother and wife split the chores, and his parents love their grandkids. Babysitters are always available. Both the guy and his father are hardcore business types, the father is a college dropout entrepreneur, the son has an MBA. I gather there's some friction sometimes, it seems to work pretty well. That's in Japan, though the same thing happens in a lot of Asia, and to a much lesser extent, the Mediterranean countries still a little bit. Family ties are a lot closer - I remember being in Italy and thinking how cool it was when I saw grandfather/father/son all eating together quite a lot out at a restaurant, having some guy's time.<p>So, I agree with you, especially the way parenting/freedom in the West works. But I'm personally going to try to keep my home in such a way that the kids feel welcome for a long time - ideally they are independent enough to self-emancipate quite young, but can come back and feel very comfortable at home even as they get into later adulthood. A hard balance to strike and tradeoffs involved, but good if can be gotten down well.",1273732574

If someone says something I think is right, then I upvote to show my support and hope his viewpoint is propagated enough so that further misunderstandings on the issue is avoided.

The problem is that you are in a conflicted state that must be manually resolved.</i><p>I think that the point is that file 'foo' has already been merged, regardless of the conflict in file 'bar'. There is no way for you to revert to the pre-update state. In git, your previous commit still exists in the objects store even if it is no longer connected to the tree. And garbage collection won't even clean it out right away because it is still in the reflog ('git reflog'). The point being that once something is committed, it's permanently (barring garbage collection) in the repository. Whenever you make a change to a commit, a new commit is created, some pointers are changed, and the old commit still remains in the repository.<p>> <i>Oh, and somename is never tab-completed but othername is.</i><p>Responsibility for the tab-completion falls squarely on your shell (or where ever you got the tab-completion setup from).

These under-performing schools are often in poor areas, where the family educational expectations are low, and the home-life is not conducive to educational success.

Before he joined the Marines towards the end of WWII he was a laborer and union member, and as far as he could tell the union offered virtually no benefit to young and talented workers. Mediocre workers who were loyal to the union long enough to gain seniority did well, but ability got you nowhere.<p>In the wartime Marine Corps he wasn't promoted quickly but he was still given the duties and responsibilities he was capable of as soon as he proved himself.<p>The private armies and so forth were mostly a 19th century phenomenon.",1273731231

Ignoring 9/11, the last 10 years the safety has clearly gone up very much compared the previous 20 years. 23 crashes in the 80's, 15 in the 90's, and just 7 in the last decade (again, ignoring 9/11).<p>On the flipside, every crash except 1 in the last 10 years has been 100% fatal, whereas the previous 20 years there are quite a number of crashes with a lot of survivors.<p>I dunno, I just find that interesting. :P",1273730730

You should be comparing yourself to the compensation of an employee after adding the employer's portion of the social security and medicare taxes back in.  This calculation represents the true cost of the employee's labor to the employer, who is indifferent between whether the money is paid to the employee or to the government.  This is why it makes no sense to me to say ""the employer's portion"" because the employee really bears the burden.",1273730628

Can I upvote this article, but when it gets 5 down votes decide that I should exit it and go short?<p>If I can't exit my position, then what is the incentive for me to ever be the first person to vote on an article?<p>I think it's intuitively obvious to everyone that an article with 20 up votes will not start getting down voted all of a sudden. If I were to guess, I'd say that after 5 or so up votes, you're 90% or more to see a higher close; after 20, it's probably more than 99%. However, at 0 votes, you're probably close to 50/50 (again, just guessing based on experience).<p>If you can't exit, then your risk of ruin is way too high to make initial voting worth it. If you can exit, then it becomes easy to game the system by switching sides quickly.<p>Also, what about the ability of people to submit really crappy articles on a dummy account and then down vote them on a main account in order to build karma?",1273730496
