All calls have to be in by a millisecond before the hour, and after resolution no more transactions occur until the next hour.  Now everyone has to cool off for a bit before making a trade based on changes to the market, and algo trading is relegated to stocks that don't matter.  Any transaction worth making will have a human thinking about them for an hour, and it regulates the top speed of a crash.",1273377474

But I'm not sure any of these alternatives are any better on that front.<p>It would be nice to have some sort of verifiable guarantees that these companies don't use, sell, share, or give away any of the information they collect from me and about me and my circle of friends.<p>It would be even better were they mathematically incapable of collecting any of this sort of information at all.  I'm envisioning maybe some combination of Tor (or maybe anonymous remailers) and social networking, where not even the owners of the network know who's talking to whom and what they're saying (at least that's how it's supposed to work in theory).<p>The problem is that many of the value-added features that social networking sites provide rely on knowing something about the participants and who they're communicating with.  And the more of this knowledge the site has, the more useful/fun services it can provide.<p>So it seems that social networking sites and real privacy/anonymity are diametrically opposed.  So I'm not sure how useful a completely anonymous and private social networking site would be.<p>Still, no doubt there's lots of room for improvement from a complete privacy-invading site like Facebook.

Along the way, we've made a number of product decisions based on those tenets.  Among those are link permanence (link destinations don't change once created), the avoidance of anything that interferes with user experience (we've never framed, nor will we), and a dedicated focus on spam and malware detection, so that our users can click on bit.ly links with a high degree of confidence.<p>We take our responsibility as internet citizens seriously, and you'll see this exhibited even in the small details of the ways in which we manage flagged links (you'll notice we never actually disable a redirect, and at most simply insert an interstitial which retains the end destination link).<p>In the course of analyzing content for spam, malware, and phishing attacks, we rely on a number of systems, both internal and external.  Over the course of the past year, a number of spammers have attempted to use various levels of indirection through redirectors (some of which are reconfigurable), in order to obfuscate and cloak their efforts.  In fact, the bulk of shortens  to bit.ly coming through other URL shorteners have tended to be attempts to spam the system.  While our crawlers do of course follow links through redirections, the inclusion of modifiable redirects in the stream, and our analysis of the preponderance of spam attempts via these vectors have made it necessary and appropriate in some cases to block the URL shorteners.<p>Just to reiterate, the only goal is and always has been to protect the end user clicking on bit.ly links, regardless of the link source.  Given that multiple layer wrapping of URL redirectors tends to be an edge case based on inappropriate API usage, confused users, or in the preponderance of cases, attempts to spam, we think this has been a fair approach. As such, you'll note that we did in fact update our interstitial warning pages with language better reflecting the reasoning behind the status.  We're happy to see a healthy, vibrant, shortening ecosystem, and have no intention whatsoever to put a damper on other sites in the space.<p>Some have suggested we simply not shorten URLs already pointing to 3rd party short URLs.  While this is a potential possibility, our API responses and the innumerable clients and scripts that use these methods aren't currently designed with this state in mind.  Consequently, any changes would have to be carefully considered.<p>As with any product, bit.ly is a work in progress, and we're always interested in finding ways to best serve our users, while maintaining the integrity and openness 
of the product.",1273374571
