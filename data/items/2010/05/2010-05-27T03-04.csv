We'd do well to stop inventing more of the same crap and actually advancing the state of the art. C isn't going anywhere nor do I think it should, but it should be used only when nothing else will do.<p>Since about version 3 C# has gotten interesting. Still, even the new interesting bits are rehashed ideas from the 70s and 80s.

It's the only way to take a critical eye one what you have done and learn from it.<p>Lots of people think Jobs is a tyrant inside of Apple (and I agree with that sentiment), but I think the motivation for that is that he simply wants to create something he doesn't hate <i>right now</i>. It might be bootup time, or interface delays, or screen pixel density etc. That kind of thinking, a critical review of your own likes/dislikes is healthy I think in order to grow.<p>Fanboyism, by definition, is not a process of critical thought.",1274931717

I used the word ""specialize"" because I was responding to a claim from the OP. I took it to mean something more than ""have used"" or ""are familiar with"". I took it to mean something like ""has written more than one substantial project using"". Did your co-workers fit into that category? Do you expect that they represent the norm of those who ""specialize"" in the system? I expect that most people who have written more than one substantial project using Coq work in program verification or type theory, where the name ""coq"" is not unusual enough that it still evokes laughter.<p>KERMIT also said: ""Coq won't catch on in many places where it'd be very useful solely because of its name.""<p>I am surprised by this. Are you sure? Have you witnessed this? In the laughing case or cases you mention, did the laughter turn into a rejection of the idea because of the name? Do you think Isabelle or HOL get used more often as a result?<p>I just expect more from technical professionals -- not that they never laugh at a silly dirty joke, but that major project decisions are based on more than programming language's name, especially in a sparse field like the one Coq is in.",1274931556

I am truly unsure the original intent.<p>English is pretty good, I agree, though phrasal verbs are the work of the devil. It has a head start in aviation, mathematics, engineering, some television, finance, and computer science. The British did a good job of seeding it everywhere and WWII gave it a large boost. Then again, the dissolution of the empires in the 60s made English and French <i>less</i> fashionable in many areas of the world as nationalism took hold.<p>Favoring ""gradual unforced adoption"" is a fine thing. I suppose I favor it too, as a ""lingua franca"" but not as a single global language. Knowledge of history does, I'm sorry to disagree with you here, qualify one to have a credentialed opinion. Language hegemony has <i>never</i> happened without a lot of people getting killed. I do not favor that, and I trust you don't either. Maybe this time will be different, who knows? America has always had wonderful, astonishing optimism.<p>But keep in mind that what you are proposing is no less than closing the book on many venerable, vibrant, and (ahem) more populous cultures.

If not, you can be in the top 10% of earners, and you can only ""afford"" to buy a house equivalent to those in the top 30-40% who got in pre-2001.<p>In major cities in Canada, $500k will get you an ""ok"" cookie cutter in the suburbs, if you're lucky.  In the US, where the bubble has burst, $500k will, in most places, get you what seems like a mansion.",1274929747
