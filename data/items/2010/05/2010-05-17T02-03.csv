Pays around $18/hr starting out.<p>Retail - Retail sucks if you hate what you're selling, otherwise it's not too bad. I worked in a supermarket and hated it, but a friend worked for a car parts store and absolutely loved it.<p>Delivery Driver - Friend who worked at car parts store switched to a driver after awhile and liked that even more. Load up the car and head out, get people to sign off and sometimes collect payments. I always thought I'd like this style job, mostly because it's so independent.<p>Computer repair/freelance IT work - Most people would give this a big ""hell no"", in high school I worked for a bunch of small companies and made $25/hr cleaning off viruses/repairing machines/building new PCs. I'd usually go into a place for 3-4hrs on weekends. If you don't hate it, you can make some decent money.<p>If you're fairly comfortable with computer hardware and windows, you'll get by fairly easily. For all other problems: google. The IT jobs also lead to more side work, typically the companies I worked for didn't have websites. I worked out deals with friends who were designers and asked for a finders fee for referrals I sent. (Knowing what I do now, I would've taken on the work myself at a higher rate for web development and just outsource most of it)",1274065184

But I think the author of the blog post is speaking of a problem that emerges at a larger scale when you follow more & more people. Your stream becomes bigger while the amount of time you have stays the same so your options are 1) unfollow people, 2) don't read everything, or 3) put in more time. Personally, I don't like 1 or 2 because I feel like I'll miss out on timely, relevant information and 3 isn't an option for most of us.

1353365,comment,1352154,1352810,0,0,barrkel,,,"With STM and persistent data structures, you're fundamentally limited by how fast you can change a single memory location; and you can't freely modify the memory location because of the risk of missed updates. Cliff's table operates concurrently over the whole data structure - there's no single bottleneck, rather every slot in the table is potentially an update location.<p>When I said thousands of threads, I was stressing the massively concurrent potential of Cliff's design, but more importantly, the point where the hardware is fully subscribed and physical hardware threads are frequently trying to update the data structure. If there are only 2 threads involved on a dual-core machine, depending on everything else (constant factors), I would still expect Cliff's table to be faster.<p>Clojure's approach is at a different level of abstraction than Cliff's approach. Probably a better analogy would be whether it's better to manufacture a car or use a travel agent. Not everybody could safely manufacture a car, but almost anyone can use a travel agent with moderate phone, social and organizational skills.

This pipe did have a shutoff valve for exactly this situation, but it failed and will not activate. So basically your option is to squeeze the steel pipe shut, and hopefully this doesn't weak the pipe causing it to break. Also, apparently the pipe is mostly covered by rock, so somehow you have to work around that.<p>I'm sure we've all tried to stop the water from coming out of the garden hose by putting a kink in the hose.
