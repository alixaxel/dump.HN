At the preliminary injunction phase, everything is gauged on probabilities and a judge has a lot of discretion in deciding the issues.<p>As reported in this article, based on P 10's preliminary showing, the judge was not convinced that P 10 would likely prevail on the merits based on the evidence submitted (meaning, the issue of whether infringement occurred remains open for trial but the judge did not see compelling enough evidence at this point), was not convinced that P 10 would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were denied (since it waited 4 years even to file the suit, the natural question in the judge's mind is ""what's another year or so to get to trial"" if no urgency has been shown to date), and was not convinced that the public interest would be served by granting the request.<p>Thus, a significant victory for RapidShare but, at the same time, just one more step along the path of getting to trial, where the merits of the case will ultimately be decided. It may be a precursor of things to come but that will depend on whether P 10 can shore up its evidence of infringement before the actual trial itself.

1368418,comment,1368069,1368069,0,0,mdasen,,,"Get friends who are artsy.<p>In all seriousness, I like working with a designer rather than hiring one.  Part of it is how one sees design.  Is design something you can just purchase?  If so, isn't code just something you can purchase?  I think that part of the reason we're here is that we realize that you can't just buy your way out of code problems.  Code is important, it takes dedication and hard work not the fulfillment of some sort of spec list.<p>The same is true, in my personal opinion, of design.  The design and interactions that users are going to experience are of a lot of importance.  It's not that hard to find a designer who will work with you on a project. The key is to treat them like a partner rather than someone who is doing some lower form of work that you don't really need, but will make it look flashier to users.  Even if you don't have money, it's possible to get people to come on if they're a partner in the project.  I mean, artsy people really understand not getting paid (especially if you're in the same not getting paid boat).  They don't understand being belittled and unappreciated - really, who does?<p>So, respect, partnership and working together can go a long way on random projects that probably won't amount to much.  There are lots of sites like <a href=""http://99designs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://99designs.com</a> where you can get people to compete on spec.  It feels a bit cold to me - as if once a design is made, it's done.  I prefer a more continual improvement thing.<p>I'm not saying 99designs doesn't serve a good purpose.  It's just not my style. I also have a lot of artsy friends so it might be easier for me than you.  If you can find someone who is good at graphic design and understands user experience, data layout, etc. it's awesome.",1274469062
