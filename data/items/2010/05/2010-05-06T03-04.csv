When you shrink Flash down too far, you run into problems like having the electrons tunnel out through defects in the insulator. The limit is supposed to be about the 20 nm node. And apparently memristors are supposed to be practical to manufacture quite a bit smaller than that. And if we get the manufacturing techniques right, we'll be able to layer memristors in a fairly straightforward way.",1273115805

It's not hard to see it as possible, as we're already assuming P exists and finishes: allowing it <i>more</i> flexibility should only make it <i>more</i> likely to exist.<p>By allowing it to not finish on paradoxical situations, it can exist in what would normally be a paradox.  Thus P(Q(Q)) can indeed exist, because P(Q) does, even though it does not return.<p>There may still be a way to prove such a paradox-avoiding P cannot exist; I'm not claiming that.  Just wondering why we require it to return, when as far as I can tell there's no legitimate, real-world reason to do so.  Sure, it makes the proof easier, and allows us to use simple logical grammars... but since when has ""simple"" always been correct?<p>The equivalent would be the oracle remaining silent, denying the paradox the possibility of existing.  If no statement is made, no paradox can be formed.",1273115750

The era of ""easy"" consumer firmware updating has been a mess over the last few years. Companies ship beta quality software with the knowledge they can fix things later. Maybe they will -- maybe they won't. What happens if the company goes out of business? What if the model just doesn't sell well enough to justify further firmware development? Everyone knows DRM is bad but I don't think we spend enough time knocking companies for this horrible practice of making consumers chase the carrot of firmware upgrades. It's not a trivial task for most people especially if it requires downloading files and USB memory sticks which is the case with many older BR players.",1273115293

The formal proof grinds through the details to make sure those concepts do, in fact, pan out as we think.<p>P(Q) will finish because we defined it to do so. It will return either <i>true</i> or <i>false</i>. The problem isn't with the termination (or non-termination) of P(Q), it's with Q(Q). The termination status of Q(Q) is what gives us the paradox: its behavior is the opposite of what P(Q) said it would be. If we can construct a case where P behaves contrary to its definition, then it cannot exist.<p>In other words, we asked our oracle ""Will Q finish?"" and our oracle gave us a reply. Then Q went off and did the exact opposite, proving the oracle wrong. But our oracle is, by definition, always right, so we have a Serious Problem. We resolve this Serious Problem by recognizing that we asked our oracle a question that it can never know the answer to.<p>Remember that Q(Q) is what gives us the paradox in the first place. P(Q(Q)) is nonsense. It's like recognizing that 4/0 is undefined, then trying to define cos(4/0).<p>I think your discussion about a ""real-world P"" begs the question.
