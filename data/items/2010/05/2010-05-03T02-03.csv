1313774,comment,1312936,1312936,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"Why this article is crap.<p>>> 10. Facebook's Terms Of Service are completely one-sided<p>No they aren't. In return for accepting them, you get to use the site. See? Two-sided.<p>>> 9. Facebook's CEO has a documented history of unethical behavior<p>Then he proceeds to list one unproven allegation, and one lawsuit settlement. We sometimes settle lawsuits where the negative outcome, although unjust, is likely enough that the settlement is probably cheaper. These points so laughably fail the ""documented"" standard that I should just stop reading now, but I can't.<p>>> 8. Facebook has flat out declared war on privacy<p>They are responding to their users' preferences. If anything, users have declared war on privacy. The site is designed to shared information about yourself. If signing up for that site is not an invitation to privacy invasion, what is? And is it surprising that someone who believes most people want to share information about themselves, as the CEO of Facebook surely must, does not care about privacy as much as the author, who is obviously all about it?<p>>> 7. Facebook is pulling a classic bait-and-switch<p>Members, by and large, don't care. It's not Facebook's responsibility to constantly nag people about the privacy implications of setting their privacy settings to ""off"". It would make the site more difficult and annoying to use, and would likely have immeasurably small impact.<p>>> 6. Facebook is a bully<p>Wait, are we complaining about how Facebook fails to protect user privacy, or how Facebook is overzealous in protecting user privacy? It's flat out false that Facebook sued this guy. They did force him to cease and desist by threatening to sue him. Maybe they should update their robots.txt, but that's hardly a reason to stop using them.<p>>> 5. Even your private data is shared with applications [that you install]<p>Oh, just like my regular computer. Should I stop using that too? Most Facebook applications rely on some set of private data to make interesting features work. Installing these applications would be a usability nightmare for people who have their privacy shields turned up, which ironically would probably decrease the number of people using those settings. This is because most of Facebook's users, even the ones with privacy settings turned up, only care about privacy when it doesn't get in their way, and when having to choose between privacy and easy functionality, they will take the latter.<p>>> 4. Facebook is not technically competent enough to be trusted<p>They are dealing with an enormous attack surface and highly motivated attackers. I think what you mean to say is, ""Facebook's engineers cannot perfectly cover all possible vulnerabilities that their business requirements expose them to."" They are normally quick with responses and fixes, so that's a problem, but not one that any other company doing this would avoid. But the whole ""technically competent"" thing is BS. They are obviously technically competent based on the various open source projects they have released and which are seeing wide adoption.<p>>> 3. Facebook makes it incredibly difficult to truly delete your account<p>If my friends are any indication, many people who delete their accounts eventually want them back. Keeping those people from making a mistake they will later regret is probably a feature.<p>As far as making no promises about deleting your data, I can say that especially in a NoSQL environment it's very difficult to track down every little piece of data that belongs to a user. Sometimes this data is in formats that are not mutable on an individual-record basis. At my workplace we sometimes aggregate data in SSTables (see the Bigtable paper for details) that, did they contain user data, would not be immediately modifiable for each user that wanted to delete their account.<p>>> 2. Facebook doesn't (really) support the Open Web<p>This is not an issue for most normal people. But if it is an issue for you and you want to make a moral statement by closing your Facebook account, by all means, do. Facebook's incentives for maintaining their walled garden to some extent probably outweigh the loss of every user account for every person that even cares an iota about this issue.<p>>> 1. The Facebook application itself sucks<p>Seems like a lot of people like it and derive some use out of it. Sorry you don't.<p>This article is idiotic. Most of the points are flat out false, and the rest are taste issues where the author is out of touch with the zeitgeist.",1272853644

1313759,comment,1313075,1313472,0,0,Empact,,,"> It gives people an incentive to sit on their currency and hoard it away instead of investing it in productive ventures.<p>Kind of like the incentive people have when evaluating electronics, which are under consistent, massive deflation thanks to technological progress?  Not such a problem there, is it?  We're not fussing over Dell or Apple, or the car companies, for that matter, who see similar, though less pronounced, levels of technology-driven deflation.<p>Why would such a force, which is so innocuous in these areas, and which develops naturally due to the rise in productive capacity & efficiency over time, be so problematic macroscopically?  Why would people stop investing, any more than stop buying computers and cars now?  Before answering, see my following point.<p>> what incentive do they have to invest in a potentially risky venture that may make more in the long run, but may also cost them their principal?<p>An incentive driven by seeking greater return.  In your world, wouldn't everyone invest in the bond market, or buy annuities, rather than the riskier stock market?  Doesn't exactly gel with reality, does it?<p>> If you have continuous low-level inflation, however, it can be brought under control simply by reducing the money supply.<p>What does lowering the money supply do, pray tell?  Wouldn't that increase the value of the dollars remaining in the system? That's deflation, by definition.  How can it be both your solution and your problem?<p>> Deflation biases people towards inaction, Inflation biases people towards action<p>We'll speak more clearly if we aren't so broadly.  Natural deflation is not static, but a force dynamically determined by facts of the economy, such as the growth in productive output.<p>For natural deflation, little investment -> less growth in productive output -> little deflation -> more incentive to invest.  Likewise for the converse: lots of investment -> more deflation -> less incentive to invest.  This dynamic interplay is a self-regulating force which serves to naturally counteract the market propensity to go off the rails on some wasteful bubble or other.<p>Seems to me your arguments are specious, and the current bias against deflation is an orthodoxy.",1272853129

Most of the people who read this are likely to already agree with the sentiment, and those few who did not yet are convinced by reading this are unlikely to have any pull where it matters. (Plus, there was an article recently that suggests that faced with contrary evidence, people will dig their heels even deeper)<p>And the massive group of people who don't really know anything much about the subject and could be useful if they, the entire group, all read about the issues and thought about it, are hardly likely to read this. (Though I suspect this is the audience that is being targeted, seeing as how the entire article is really just an analogy)<p>Rather than seeing more of these articles, I'd like to see, oh, arguments that we can use in general regarding such issues.<p>For instance, someone says (regarding some upcoming restrictive legislation), ""Don't worry about it. It doesn't affect you if you have nothing to hide/aren't doing anything wrong"". What are the main things you want to say to respond to that?",1272852908

Someone might do ""good"" things all the time, but if you could read their thoughts and see their motivations, you might not necessarily consider them to be as good as they appear. Similarly, someone who's done a lot of bad things might not seem so bad if you knew their inner motivations. Actions only give you half the picture (if that).<p>You also seem to be making a terminological point about when it's ok to apply the term ""good person"" or ""bad person"", but that's a red herring.
