1385725,comment,1384664,1385270,0,0,buster,,,"Interestingly, a rather big/complex web ui was done in extJS and it looks like extJS will be abandoned for new projects, mainly due to: little control over generated html/css and big performance issues, not i18n support, no code splitting, no unit tests and some other problems that seem to be solved in GWT.
I, for one, am suspicious if GWT is really the better way, basically adding anotehr layer between browser and sourcecode. My feeling points me more in the direction of jQuery, which probably doesn't do all this out of the box but many of this from plugins.",1275022762

I'm really trying to be helpful here and not rain on your parade.<p>Do you expect to find a job in the future by submitting your resume? If not, then you can happily ignore what I have to say.<p>I run part of a growing software operation. As part of my current role, I've looked through well over 500 resumes to fill a variety of positions over the past few months. This isn't my primary task. This is just one of my many responsibilities. As such I have to develop filters to assess a resume to see if we are going to phone screen or pass. If we don't have strong filtering, then we would wind up overloading our staff with phone screening. They won't have enough time to do their ""real"" work. So we need to err on the side of caution and accept false negatives and skip over some capable folks because they fail a filter. Is this fair? no. Is this a reality? Yes. There is only so much time in the day. I'm not going to overload my staff and I don't want to spend my own nights reading resumes and holding phone screens.<p>So although you are a unique and wonderful snowflake who may be on the far right of the performance bell curve, if you've hopped from job to job, I won't really know why by looking at your resume. I will just see a red flag that you might be a flake, you might get scared at commitment or have poor staying power when the going gets tough, or you might have trouble getting along with people. Your 2 page resume is probably not going to address those concerns. If your resume is much longer than 2 pages, I'm going to find an excuse to mark pass on it to for a variety of reasons (but that is another story).<p>I'll give your resume the 2-3 minutes attention I can and mark pass and go on to the next resume.",1275022329

Take a look at China's nuclear power program sometime; they've brought the cost of their CPR1000 plants down to where they're cheaper to build than coal plants of the same size, and they're well on their way to do the same for the more modern AP1000 reactor design. They've got a bunch of new nuclear plants under construction, with more on the way as they pick up momentum. We're talking about 10-15 large reactors coming on line every year, with the production rate increasing as they ramp up.<p>Also, they've got their first commercial-scale pebble-bed reactors being built right now. If I remember correctly, they're also looking at incorporating thorium into the fuel mix.<p>Also, they're working on 40% and 70% more powerful versions of the AP1000 that will not add much to the cost. Nuclear power in China is going to be seriously cheap.<p>Also, they're working on fast breeder reactors, which use uranium much more efficiently. They're building two BN-800 reactors, working together with Russia, since Russia has been profitably operating fast breeder reactors in the BN series for decades.<p>If you're only looking at the US and Europe, then sure, the Nuclear Renaissance is looking a little feeble.

1385664,comment,1379417,1383649,0,0,jerf,,,"""Is xmpp that much heavier?""<p>Well, it depends. It is not commonly understood that XMPP is actually very modular. What I was citing you was the requirements for what you might call the ""usual"" XMPP server, what people tend to expect when they hook up Pidgin or Adium to something claiming to be an XMPP server for dedicated-client use. Huge rosters (in the hundreds is distressingly common, in the thousands not unheard of), server-to-server connections, avatars, conferences, frequent granular presence changes (some % of the users changing for every MP3 they play due to plugins), logging, etc.<p>On the other hand, throwing together a ""shitty"" web chat where no one chat room is expected to have more than, say, 20 users, where ""chat rooms"" are the only communication concept and rosters are more limited or perhaps nonexistent, no logging, sure, Node.js should definitely be able to scale to 100K no problem. Probably beyond with reasonable hardware.<p>I think you may be referring to Plurk's work, and please note I'm not calling their stuff ""shitty"", I'm specifically describing a minimal chat client up there. I actually don't think XMPP is all that much heavier than AIM or MSN (some, yes, but not really that bad), it's that IM has evolved past the days of ICQ. What kills you are the O(Roster Entry) elements; one guy with a 2,000 element roster (bidirectional) comes online. With XMPP, as part of the connection process you shove down the 2,000 user roster to the guy logging in, and have up to 2,000 other presence notifications to send out. And it's hard to make that entirely async; even if you do just grab the roster as a lump out of some data store, you still have to iterate over the 2000 elements of the roster to send out the presence updates, and even with GHz to play with that is going to take some time to formulate all the necessary messages. This is what would really worry me at the startup flurry I mentioned.<p>But like I said, you could still carry hundreds, most likely. Although even then I would observe that the value of having an XMPP server actually in-context to a Node.js process is really pretty minimal. You can still be a ""part of the server"" via the component protocol which is what you almost certainly really want. Let a best-of-breed do all that for you, and just implement the additional stuff you want in Node.js. Unless you're doing too many O(roster entry) things in there (which in general you aren't in a component), Node.js should scale quite well, and components can typically be sharded cleanly too (by assigning users to shards).",1275019433

In otherwords, if you can describe (draw) a picture that represents what you are talking about, then you really understand it.<p>The second was that not all math is something you can visualize.  In that some of the beauty of math is that it can describe things beyond humans abilities of perception, and that it is precisely in these cases that math is its most useful.",1275019403

-(37signals before DH) During a job interview in which JF wasnt very serious about landing the job, he randomly met an acquaintance. This person agreed to work for 37signals as a designer. This person brought a former client with him to 37signals. This client spent atleast 200,000 in services from 37signals.<p>Who knows how 37signals would have turned out without that 200k during its early years.
This was 37signals big break, not saying it ""made"" 37signals, just saying that 200k obviously helps and luck was a factor.
