However, the book is platform-agnostic; the goal is that by walking through the book and working along side it, you can go from nothing to a working (for some values of working) emulator for whatever platform it is you choose.  Along with this, I'm going to be building at least one emulator along side it, with full source available (marked by chapters) so that at any point in the book, you can flip over to the source and see how I tackled things there.  I don't want everyone in the world building Yet Another NES Emulator (TM), as fun as they are, so I'm really trying to make it as flexible as I can.",1273964273

So if you got 4 cores you can get 600k ops/sec, assuming you'll have enough bandwidth to saturate that.<p>I agree with you that if Redis performance is better than memcached there is to fill a bug or start a conversation, as there is something odd. Both are written in C and use multiplexing internally, against the same OSes. The performances should be very similar, or the memcached performances should be better as it supports less features.<p>Edit: p.s. can you please explain why running multiple memcached processes, one per core, was not good enough?",1273961613

1350768,comment,1350343,1350634,0,0,palish,,,"Think of it this way.  A program is just a set of bytes (which are numbers from 0 to 255) which describe what it should do.  The goal of most programs is usually just to read in some data (again, just a set of bytes) which is stored in memory, then manipulate that data.<p>The easiest way to understand how to emulate hardware in software is to just make up your own simple assembly language.  For example, let's say you want to have these operations:<p>""set <memory location> <value between 0 and 255>"" -- sets the value at <memory location> to the specified value<p>""add <src memory location 1> <src memory location 2>"" -- adds the numbers at the two memory locations, and stores the result into memory location 1<p>The point is to keep it ridiculously simple for now, so let's assume the memory locations we provide are also values between 0 and 255 -- effectively giving us 256 bytes of memory to work with.<p>So let's write a very simple program.  It will perform 2 + 2.<p><pre><code>  set 0 2\n  set 1 2\n  add 0 1\n</code></pre>\nThe result is now in memory location 0, and the result is ""4"" obviously.<p>So what might the program look like on disk?  Well, we only have two instructions, so let's say the code for ""set"" is ""0"" and the code for ""add"" is 1"".  If we store the program in a file, then it might look like this:<p><pre><code>  0 0 2 0 1 2 1 0 1\n</code></pre>\nNow that we've defined an extremely simple assembly language, we can write a virtual machine for it as follows.<p>First, write a program which allocates 256 bytes of memory.  This is our virtual machine's memory space.<p>- Read in the first byte of the program.<p>- If it's 0 (""set""), then read in two more bytes (the dst and value arguments for ""set"").  Set mem[dst] = value.<p>- If it's 1 (""add""), then read in two more bytes (the ""dst"" and ""src"" arguments for ""add"").  Set mem[dst] = mem[dst] + mem[src].<p>- If it's > 1, then abort (the program is invalid).<p>If this all made sense to you, then you should be a stone's throw away from being able to write a VM for more complicated instruction sets.  Just find out what the instruction set can do, and then write a VM which allows the instructions to do those things.",1273961346

I guess it wasn't a very good descriptor. Anyway, it's too late to edit it.<p>The typical chess mental game involves chains of calculations to visualize future positions, then evaluating those positions based on the potential of good or bad chains of moves. ""Strategic"" plays are based on the possibility of generating or preventing future tactical plays.<p>Bridge is more a game of inferences; out of the 26 or 39 cards you can't see (depending on the phase of play), the most important part of the game is guessing how those cards are distributed and planning for the contingencies that might arise (or the ones you need to arise). There are very few situations that involve long chains of calculations and possible positions; most of it is planning correctly, estimating probabilities (unless you're one of those talented people who can do the exact math in their heads), and good guesswork. Or at least that's how I play it...<p>It's very refreshing to play a game that works out those areas of the mind, which are so important, but for which there are few direct workouts. The best play is usually clear post-mortem, and hands change every 7 or 8 minutes, so you get a lot of quick, direct feedback.<p>The second most important part of bridge is communicating with your partner based on the limited language of putting cards down on a table, and the reason it's not the first most important part is because communicating correctly depends on inferring correctly, planning, and understanding partner's plans.",1273961089
