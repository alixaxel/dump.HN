HTTPS connection setup is significantly slower than a regular connection - you may not think that sub-second delays matter but they absolutely do in the competitive web-app world.",1273892302

1349238,comment,1348464,1348851,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Thank you.<p>As to your question of who would be the first to incriminate Gawker, rather than Chen: Probably the Computer Hacking & Intellectual Property (CHIP) unit in the criminal division of the US Attorney's office for the Northern District of California, located in San Jose. Gawker's legal representative would have to be summoned and indicted by a grand jury, unless the firm chooses to waive that right and proceed to a hearing.<p>Gawker Media LLC is a Delaware company headquartered in New York. Title 18 §3237 provides that any offence begun in one district and completed in another (eg CA and NY) can be prosecuted in either district, but it would probably be most practical to do so in California.<p>Gaby Darbyshire is COO and legal representative of Gawker Media, and per a letter [1] taken into evidence during the search was fully apprised of the situation. The letter did not repudiate or disavow Chen's actions but rather emphasized his employment by Gawker and use of his home as his regular place of employment. Under the doctrine of <i>Respondeat Superior</i>, Gawker is liable for acts carried out by Chen because an agency relationship exists between them; and because he committed a crime, in the scope of his employment, with the purpose of benefiting his employer. Even under the stricter rules of MPC 2.07, Gawker's COO and CEO appear to have approved and even reveled in Chen's illegal actions, and thus acted with <i>scienter</i>.<p>1. <a href=""http://gizmodo.com/5524843/police-seize-jason-chens-computers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gizmodo.com/5524843/police-seize-jason-chens-computer...</a> 'Gawker's legal response to police'.<p><i>small voice</i> I think...\n(edit: FYI grellas is a real attorney, whereas I'm just thinking about trying to become one...don't rely on anything I post!)",1273891696

If you could come up with a simple accounting system that didn't take three full minutes to load, even with an SSD, 4 processing cores, and 8GB of memory, you'd have a winner.  Even if your software was really bad, it  would probably still be better than Quickbooks.<p>You'd probably have to support these basic features:<p>Write Checks<p>Track Account Balances and Transactions - These need to be able to be imported in standard formats.  The format Quickbooks uses is XML.  I found it simple enough to reverse engineer that I was able to convert CSV dumps from my bank to QBO files and get them importing into Quickbooks.<p>Categorize Transactions - I need to be able to say what each transaction is.  I should be able to setup filters to automatically categorize imported transactions.  For example, at the convenience store Wawa, I buy exactly two things, coffee and gas.  If the transaction is less than $5, I want it to be categorized as personal food, if it's over $20, I want it to be categorized as gas.  I should be able to set this up, and never have to categorize one of these transactions again.<p>That's all it would really take.  You would probably want to integrate with one or more invoicing systems to track receivables.  You could setup an API then build connectors for popular applications, like Freshbooks.  A good interface for accounting for bank deposits would be helpful as well.",1273891116

This suits me...except:  I need to account for me as a person in addition to my LLC.  I want both accounts in the same system since it is common to make mistakes or to rethink the expense later: I paid on my personal credit card but its a business expense.  I paid on my business card but it should have been paid on my personal card and then reimbursed as a travel expense to employee.  There are many of these types of ""reconciliations"" between personal and business.   A good accountant looks at my mistakes and ends up making three or four entries to fix my mistake.  I don't even know how to fix the mistake.  I want one-click fixing the books for these common cases.",1273889694

Those are at the heart of any project I've been involved with, as stuff naturally gets delayed and shuffled around all the time. I have yet to find a sensible way to get a comprehensive status-view of a given <i>Goal</i> (consisting of multiple stories) in pivotal.<p>Take for example this mantis ticket, esp. the ""Relationships"":\n<a href=""http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=11330"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/view.php?id=11330</a><p>At a glance I can see what state this Goal is in, what the progress is, what it depends on, what it is blocked on (if anything) and who is involved.<p>With a few plugins mantis will also add fancy progressbars and time estimates. I think there's even a plugin to compute a velocity similar to pivotal, even though I've found that feature amazingly useless in pivotal so far. Perhaps it works better when your tasks are very uniform and your teammates are robots instead of humans. ;-)<p>As for the higher level ordering (enforcing an ordering on Goals), for that Mantis uses the Roadmap, which can ofcourse also be modified at any time as needed; <a href=""http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/roadmap_page.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mantisbt.org/bugs/roadmap_page.php</a><p>Note also that all those extra-fields that are enabled in that mantis installation (Platform, OS etc.) are optional and customizable. In my setups there's usually only one or two, which reduces the UI clutter.<p>Note also the concise ""Issue history"" at the bottom which I much prefer over the cumbersome, ajaxified, collapsing/jumping mess in pivotal.<p>Anyways, to each their own.

That should make sharding and clustering a lot easier.</i><p>This wording makes it sound like this is an advantage for the server, that it enables things you otherwise wouldn't be able to do <i>in the server</i>.  But even with SQL, something, usually the server, parses the text/string based query into what is essentially a format similar to this.  Sharding and clustering would be ""easier"" too if you didn't need to do them in your application, if the server side stuff just handled it.  Removing the need to parse SQL can remove the need to do that from your stack, but the server usually handles this anyway.  The way we think about sharding and clustering now usually puts that functionality into the application or into middleware where you need to be aware of it.  There's nothing stopping a server from taking a text based SQL query and offloading all those scaling features from the app itself.",1273888820
