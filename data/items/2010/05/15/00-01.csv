I know that the web is littered with questions on this matter, but I still haven't been able to apply the answers I can find to my situation. I hence kindly beseech HNers to share your wisdom on this rather outdated issue.<p>I realize there is VBA, but I always disliked having the program/macro living inside the (say) Excel file, with the resulting bloat, security warnings, etc. I'm thinking along the lines of a VBScript that works on a set of Excel files while leaving them macro-free. Now, I've been able to ""paint the first column blue"" for all files in a directory following this approach, but I need to do more complex operations (charts, pivot tables, etc.), which could greatly benefit from the additional tools found in VBA.<p>For this specific example knowing how to remove all macros from all files after processing would be enough, but all suggestions are welcome. Any good references? (+) Any advice on how to best approach <i>external</i> batch processing of Excel files and its Office cousins?<p>Thanks!<p>(+) Even if the reference is, ""Ask in this other website: _____.""",1273885149

A public-by-default?""</i><p>Yes.<p>I share some of those things you mentioned, and I think our society would be better off if it were more acceptable to do so. However, those are absurd examples to bring up in this discussion. Few shared those things on Facebook even when it was friends-only. In the context of things people typically share on Facebook, public-by-default is perfectly appropriate.<p>Even if people did share those things privately on Facebook, we're talking about defaults. Out of all the things people share on Facebook, a small fraction of posts actually need to be private in the eyes of their authors. The default settings should reflect that, and people should restrict privacy when they need to.<p><i>""...recognize that the decision to share that information belongs to the individual, not anybody else.""</i><p>No one has suggested otherwise.",1273885074

1349073,comment,1348464,1348998,0,0,grellas,,,"It is usually pretty easy for a trade secret owner to show that it is protecting its property by taking reasonable and prudent steps to assure that the information is kept confidential (e.g., by making everybody who deals with it sign NDAs, etc.). Accordingly, most proprietary developments of tech companies do fall within the protectable trade secret category unless the company explicitly makes the information public (e.g., by open sourcing it).<p>I don't think there is any particular need to worry about stumbling upon trade secret information and incurring the risk of criminal prosecution. Anyone in such a position who has honest intentions can have a pretty good sense of what to do (report it, turn it in, etc.) and, if unsure, at least of what <i>not</i> to do (sell it for $$$, rip off serial numbers, photograph details and publish them on the web).<p>Remember, each of the criminal statutes requires that someone act in relation to trade secrets ""with intent to"" do something wrong (convert them to his own use, harm the owner, etc.), and prosecutors must prove this ""intent"" element (what the lawyers call <i>mens rea</i> or ""evil intent"") beyond a reasonable doubt.

So the 1964 Civil Rights Act is intended to ban that sort of unwritten-rules discrimination.

1349054,comment,1348464,1348982,0,0,briansmith,,,"It is pretty normal to request verification of ownership from somebody who claims to be the rightful owner of something lost. For example, let's say you found an iPhone (or bag of cash) on the street and posted a ""Found iPhone"" (or ""Found Bag of Cash"") ad on Craigslist. I bet somebody--probably multiple people--would reply that it is theirs pretty quickly. Are you going to ask them to verify in some way that it is theirs? If so, would your request for verification constitute a refusal to return it to the rightful owner? I don't think so. In particular, if you ""returned"" it to someone who wasn't the rightful owner, the rightful owner could sue you and/or worse, so it's in your best interest to verify that you are returning it to the correct people.<p>I think one aspect of this case is particularly interesting: I have the impression that the phone was much more likely to be returned by Gizmodo than by the ""finder."" And, I think Gizmodo paid for access to the phone, knowing that they would have to return it to Apple if it was Apple's. The thing I'm really curious about is whether the court thinks they really ""bought"" the phone, or whether they paid for temporary access to the phone and agreed to return it to Apple if it was theirs, or whether there's no difference legally. In other words, it seems likely that Gizmodo's payment for the phone enabled and/or accelerated its return to Apple. (Compare it to the case of the <i>other</i> lost iPhone prototype in Vietnam this week, which Apple will almost definitely never get back.)",1273884326

Take multiple, consecutive screenshots (faster, with a shortcut key)\n2. Immediately view your screenshots for annotation/re-arrangement/description\n3. Click 'Create Story'\n4. Get URL of new story (copied to your clipboard automatically), ready to paste anywhere<p>With it, you'll be able to skip mundane steps like:<p>- Locating where/which screenshot files to work with\n- Juggling between local files to open for annotation (unnecessary decisions get painful after lots of repetition)\n- Opening a browser window (Storyteller pops up when you need it)\n- Locating the files to upload\n- Waiting for the story to finish creating and copying the URL manually\n- Closing the browser window/tab<p>I personally like the speed and general smoothness of a native app too.<p>I have been uploading step-by-step screenshots quite a bit to reply my customers for a previous product of mine called Freshlog, a tool that helps create screenshot-attached documents in project management services like Basecamp and issue trackers like Unfuddle, Github etc (<a href=""http://freshlog.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freshlog.com</a>).<p>My customers have found my step-by-step screenshot walkthroughs very helpful and it has always been a pleasure to go the extra mile to make these for them.<p>However, after doing this many, many times a day, it can get very time consuming and tiring, so I made Storyteller. :)",1273883191
