But still, I think it's ok to have half-baked code out there -- you just need to mark releases occasionally.  Those can be as slow or frequent as you like, but it's still important for people to see what's going on in the interim.  And in turn, those people can help you get it fully baked.<p>As for controlled feature revelation, I think that's counter to the spirit of open source community -- the community is not really on equal footing with the company.  It like you're saying ""aren't we nice to share our code with you"" rather than ""let's all work on this together"".<p>Well that's my two cents.  I understand that not every company feels they can work that way, but I think the really successful projects have figured this out.",1272736414

Also, as noise, they don't yell out ""intelligence!"" as much as an analog radio signal, which is clearly from an intelligent source. Nuclear explosions may have some special characteristics, but frankly there's always something exploding somewhere out there in the cosmos. It's difficult to characterize the exact detection radius, but it's probably much smaller than you think.<p>Interestingly, as we become more efficient with our radio transmissions, which is to say, use less power, and ever more of it is locked behind at least one of excellent compression or encryption, it seems that the natural evolution of a civilization may return it to something that looks pretty natural again at a distance of light years. Dim, high-entropy signals once again become difficult to distinguish against background noise.<p>To be honest, the thing that yells ""LIFE!"" that is probably detectable out to a far greater distance than anything we humans have done is our oxygen atmosphere. We stand on the verge of doing elementary spectroscopy on distant planets ourselves.<p>Come to think of it, this is probably the most powerful argument against the paranoid alien. The paranoid, relativistic-projectile-firing alien isn't even looking for a sign of intelligence; the logic says they should extinguish <i>all other life</i>, just in case. But our planet has been broadcasting ""I'm alive!"" across the cosmos for between 1.6 to 2.5 <i>billion</i> years. If somebody out there was looking to preemptively kill everybody around them, they would already have gotten to Earth.<p>(Waiting until you can see a trace of intelligence is too late, after all, without FTL. In cosmological terms that's the striker hitting the alarm bell. You want to get there <i>long</i> before that. And even if you have FTL you're still safer preemptively neutralizing planets. Remember, it is <i>trivial</i> to neutralize a planet and reset its biological clock to zero; if you can wait a hundred years or two then very gently nudging a very large asteroid will do the trick, and if you're impatient there's any number of faster ways to do the same thing with very, very, <i>very</i> modest energy investments. Sterilizing a planet is <i>easy</i>.)<p>(On that note, no, neither the dinosaur extinction event nor any other impact would match this profile. An intelligence would <i>successfully</i> sterilize the planet, not merely ""substantially stress the ecosystem"".)",1272735944
1310875,comment,1310432,1310432,0,0,DrSprout,,,"Unless they're active colonizers, moving from solar system to solar system consuming all available resources, I don't see why we would want to fear them. Assuming they are, if anything they would avoid solar systems that might have active defense.<p>It's also possible such a civilization might follow much the model many hope to create for humanity, colonizing worlds then sending out new seed missions to every available world. If that's the case, there are three possibilities:<p>A. They respect other life, and avoid inhabited systems.
B. They fear other life, and seek out inhabited systems.
C. They don't care about other life, and attempt to colonize all systems they can.<p>Because of the assumed exponential growth life is capable of, and the distances between stars, the limiting factor is travel time, not growth, so it follows that the difference between B&C is negligible.<p>Now, if they have some form of FTL travel, then B could be a problem. However, it seems likely that if FTL aliens were interested in destroying us, they would have found us by now and begun monitoring anyway.",1272735879

You can like or dislike this feature without believing it goes ""well across the line"" of ethical behavior. We're talking about blog posts here, not scientific research or human life or politics or anything where a serious discussion of the ethics involved might be warranted.<p>Posterous isn't stealing money from anyone, and to the end user they aren't changing a single aspect of the user experience. They are altering the links of content creators slightly. Now, let's discuss that.<p>These links aren't being redirected to anywhere but the original destination. Adding an unobtrusive query parameter is absolutely not the same thing as pointing everyone to another website. I respect the opinion that it shouldn't be done, but I don't agree.<p>There are two arguments in play, the first is that altering links at all is fundamentally wrong. I can't refute that because it seems to be purely opinion driven. I can only say that I disagree, and that to me, things which have no detectable impact on the end user are not fundamentally wrong.<p>The other argument, and the one I find particularly silly, is this notion that Posterous shouldn't be privately profitting off other people's content. This is, in fact, how the entire economy of the ad driven web works. Users create content, site owners make money. See Google ads. What Posterous is doing is exactly the same thing, except it's better because I don't have to actually look at ads and I can still support the site.<p>Should Posterous have told people? Yeah. Should they offer an option to turn it off? Probably. But these are relatively minor complaints about an otherwise harmless feature.",1272734507
