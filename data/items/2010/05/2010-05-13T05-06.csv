They have a great chance of ""breaking out"" with large support, so they would be voted on early by supporters to reap the reward.<p>- Divisive stories/comments would scare away any voters and eventually only stories that were beneficial to the entire community would be voted on. So in this scenario, this system helps to define the community.<p>edit: Also, the problem that you describe isn't isolated to my system. In the current HN system, people don't comment on stories because they fear that their comment will be ""divisive"" and attract negative votes. My system encourages voting, which would reward someone for voting on a ""-3"" comment (that makes it back to 0 or 1) that is beneficial to the conversation.",1273729978

E.g., if you make a note ""book restaurant"", then you can bust that open and put in the restaurant details.<p>I tried Evernote before deciding to create FolderBoy.

The problem is that you are in a conflicted state that must be manually resolved. Unfortunately, making updates atomic across a branch has disadvantages. For example, svn lets you update individual files or directories instead of the whole branch. If you want to avoid this pitfall in the future, run ""svn merge --dry-run -r BASE:HEAD ."" before a real update. (I wish svn update had a --dry-run flag. Just because git is bad doesn't mean svn is perfect.)<p>Also, your scenario is extremely unlikely. I've used svn for 5 years and I've encountered that problem once. It was for a binary file. Two versions of the same image. It's not very often that two developers create a new file with the same name at practically the same time. It's even less often that those files can be properly merged.<p><i>By your logic, ""rm"" is flawed because it doesn't ask for confirmation when you pass -f instead of -i. Well, yeah. Sorry.</i><p>$ git checkout blah<p>This command either switches to branch blah or it erases all uncommitted changes in a directory or file named blah. Without more information, you can't tell. I find that frustrating and annoying. Your analogy would be more accurate if rm somename was the equivalent of apt-get update, and rm othername was rm -fr othername.
