1346504,comment,1346328,1346328,0,0,apsurd,,,"Recently Andrew Hyde from techstars dropped us a line at HN about boulder startup week, which just passed. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1283461"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1283461</a> (details here: <a href=""http://boulderstartupweek.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boulderstartupweek.com/</a>)<p>Techstars, courtesy of pivotal labs made good on their offer and they paid for my plane fare to and from Boulder. I am working on a blog post about my honest experiences there but since this thread is here I might as well post!<p>Boulder is a beautiful place. It is pristine, very nature-y and the people are quite friendly -- they smile as they yield to you crossing the street. There is no graffiti, no littering, and everything is in walkable distance.<p>I am from L.A. born and raised so going to Boulder was quite the experience. Everyone is white, white and tall! I am not white, and I am not tall. There are 3 trashcans most places; compost, recyclables, landfill. The ""Trident"" coffee shop is (from what I been told) the latest shop you can go to; it closes at 11pm.<p>Boulder is a bubble, and the boulderites know and are proud of their bubble. The people there love their lifestyle and many are quick to say how much ""they aren't like L.A. or S.F."". It's not disdain so much as it is pride in their town -- I like that.<p>Above all I think it is correct to say that everyone in Boulder is open to helping out. I mean that as generally as that sounds. Sure people in tech get all happy when they talk to other people in tech, but when we were holding a meeting at ""Atlas"" coffee shop, the manager of the store joined in on the conversation. I asked her some follow up questions as a  ""local small business"" and we now follow eachother on twitter. At ""The Cup"" I talked to a worker that that had a lot of tattoos about my ideas regarding tattoos and tech ... it was nice.<p>I think in Boulder.... people are <i>on the same team</i>, they like to think of it like that.<p>I love L.A. though, I have been to S.F. and aside from it having to deal with a lot of tourism, it is a great place as well. S.F. is big so naturally the bar is high. I think it is wrong to say just because Boulder is <i>so helpful</i> that SF is not helpful. YC is very helpful, I enjoyed startupschool and YC alumni are some of the most proactive and helpful people I've met.<p>Boulder is great, but all places have their worth. Boulder is a bubble, and some people like that - nothing wrong there. I would work in Boulder for a startup. I love the friends I've made there. Boulder is authentic in its specific and niche way.\nBut there is no denying that in bigger cities, you've got to deal with a much larger sampling of ""authenticity"" - L.A. may be dirty, but it's more indicative of a wide range of the world than Boulder is. There is no correct lens to view the world through though.<p>Maybe I'm not making sense. Boulder is a great startup scene. But in the end, a real entrepreneur is going to make the best with what he's got. Don't get the impression that because you are not in xyz town you are handicapped.<p>Thanks for reading.",1273809228
1346503,comment,1345281,1345281,0,0,abeppu,,,"No one's brought up <i>special sauce</i>. The trick to getting hired to do interesting software engineering work when you're not a brilliant programmer is to bring more than just programming skills to the table.  I didn't start programming seriously until I was in college (TI-89s, LOGO and ActionScript don't really count).  And I didn't even major in CS.  But I took CS classes, and I learned some Bayesian statistics and some natural language processing and a little machine learning stuff, and I got hired right out of school as a software engineer doing analytics for a company with an information retrieval focus.  And I realized that for most of the really interesting problems, just being a good programmer isn't enough.  I have coworkers who are more talented programmers than I am.  Some of them can code faster, or with fewer bugs or less thought.  And I'm grateful to learn from them, and to become a better programmer fostered by an environment with some really good programmers.  But the very best projects and problems need some additional creative spark, or mathy trick, or UI magic, or <i>something</i> beyond just the code itself, and sometimes, I get to contribute that something.<p>So if I was in the OP's shoes (and I almost was, although I wasn't a bad programmer when I left school, just green), yes, learn to program and work on projects on your own.  But also learn some stuff that your coworkers aren't likely to know.  For me, it was just enough Bayesian stats and applications thereof to have insights that others wouldn't.  For someone else, it might be distributed systems, or computer vision, or physical simulations, or information design, or algorithmic game theory, or fancy math,  or any corner of the CS or math or statistics literature that has a pratical application but which most programmers don't know.  I found that even good programmers won't generally know how to take the KL divergence between two distributions, or write the EM algorithm or put take the MAP estimate of a binomial rate parameter given a beta prior, but there are a lot of software applications for that kind of knowledge.  And the world is <i>full</i> of cool problems waiting to be solved by someone who knows how to program, but also knows something else.",1273809216

1346498,comment,1346146,1346425,0,0,starkfist,,,"Biking is good exercise but is quite efficient so you have to do a lot of it to get the same effect as running or even walking. For instance, it takes me about 1.5 hours to walk to work and I burn about 600 calories. The same distance on a bike, even going pretty fast, I only burn about 350 calories. And that's going flat out the whole way... in reality there are many opportunities to coast.<p>I've found that walking is underrated as an exercise. If you live in a suitable area (like NYC) it's easy to walk 2 hours a day, and you can also use the time to talk on the phone, listen to podcasts or books on tape, or just be outdoors.",1273809038

It matters not that a public servant pays taxes - that money goes straight back into the government, and pays him back.<p>I disagree with you strongly that wealth distribution is <em>required</em> for a stable society.  I would say that forced wealth redistribution leads to unstable societies, as it all degenerates into what is fair and unfair, of which everyones idea is different.  As soon as the route to wealth becomes one of obtaining power and influence rather than hard work, you're on the road to Greece and riots in the streets.  Or total collapse of government/society such as former communist countries, which were based by definition on wealth redistribution.  The concept of fairness should apply only to being able to keep the bulk of the wealth created by onesself.<p>Government services are necessary for a stable society, no doubt.  Government services in a lot of cases increase the wealth of society by providing natural monopolies such as roads, ports, police and defense.  We all benefit from government services.<p>I'll put it into an analogy.  10 people are on a deserted island, and there are tasks to be done to survive, which is fish, collect coconuts and fresh water.  If 5 people are collecting coconuts, fish and fresh water, and sharing it to the other 5, then it doesn't matter what the other 5 are doing, whether painting pictures, snoozing in the sun, formulating foreign policy or building rafts to invade the neighbouring island, you can't escape the fact that one half of the island is working to provide for the other half.  When they invade the other island and find a fridge full of beer, the total wealth and benefits for the island go up, but 50% of the people are still living off the work of the other 50%.<p>Anyway you slice it, if you're working for the government in any way, you're getting paid by tax receipts.  And when 50% of the economy is government services, one half of the economy is paying for the other half. It's not a perfect analogy but is intended to get people thinking about the size of government.  The only exceptions are where governments own money-creating investments like net positive sovereign wealth funds, and they are few and far between, and usually identified by having low or no taxes.",1273806868

But when you scale down far enough, you reach a point where there are zero companies in the sector, yet there are still non-zero number of people wishing to have that kind of job if they could.
