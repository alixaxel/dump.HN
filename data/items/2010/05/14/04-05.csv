1346597,comment,1342635,1346426,0,0,gnaritas,,,"You know the problem with simple analogies, they're simple, the world isn't.<p>> I didn't say anything about benefits. I was talking about money.<p>Of course you didn't because you think it's about money, but it isn't.  So lets complicate your analogy a bit.<p>> 10 people are on a deserted island, and there are tasks to be done to survive, which is fish, collect coconuts and fresh water. If 5 people are collecting coconuts, fish and fresh water, and sharing it to the other 5, then it doesn't matter what the other 5 are doing.<p>It most certainly does matter because reality isn't that simple.  If the other 5 people, in exchange for those fish, coconuts, and fresh water, also provide in exchange other necessary services to those <i>workers</i> such as medical care, law enforcement, and education then they most certainly are not parasites living off the backs of the productive as you wrongly imply.<p>It matters not whether you pay a private company via income or government via taxes if they are providing the same useful services to you; those services don't come free.  The difference is a philosophical one of whether you have a choice in the matter.  One half is not supporting the other, both halves are mutually supporting each other, the flow of money is irrelevant.<p>Your mistake is in wrongly saying the government workers are not doing anything productive or contributing in any way and that's simply not the case.<p>Collectivism tends to benefit the weak the most and the whole group overall while disadvantaging the strong.  Individualism benefits the strong the most, benefits the collective some, and disadvantages the weak massively.  As the strong are always going to be outnumbered by the average and the weak, it's only natural that any democracy tends to eventually slightly favor the collective rather than let the few dominate.  But swing to far to either extreme and everything falls apart.  You can't let the strong take too much or the collective rebels and you can't let the collective take too much or the strong rebel.<p>Redistribution of wealth through social policy maintains this balance and prevents the fall back to serfdom which is what happens when the strong get too much power/money and pass it down one generation to the next.  Not taking too much and letting the individuals still accumulate a decent amount of wealth prevents the fall to communism which destroys any incentive to be productive.  It's a balancing act, and it's not at all simple.",1273813156

One of the great things about Boulder compared to the rest of Colorado is that it is the closest thing we have to a community built around ideas, innovation, education, science, progress, justice, health and sustainability. And therefore draws and keeps people who care about these things. Sounds like great stuff to me. How could one <i>not</i> like those things?<p>The negative stereotypes are also true, in some ways, (ex-60's-hippies, trustafarians, spoiled university kids, so-called-environmentalists-driving-huge-ass-SUV's-with-black-windows-talking-on-cellphones-while-driving-in-the-rain, etc.) but I think the positive aspects of the town far outweigh the negative.

No, going to the W3C is not the answer.<p>I tend to think that if we can get people to stop <i>using</i> h.264 for <i>anything</i>, then freer codecs could gain traction - particularly On2's (now Google's) VP8.<p>Or, taking the bigger perspective, we should be complaining to the US Congress: patents are the problem, not Microsoft's choice in codecs.

But, amazingly, after playing around with your tool for about half the three hours that have elapsed since you posted it, I'm LESS worried about Facebook than I was before. Pretty much since I joined Facebook I have been posting links (including yours today) to my profile about Facebook privacy. Among my circle of Facebook friends, it is cool to have carefully considered privacy settings, and to be circumspect in what to post online. I have good conversations about interesting links on my profile and on my feed (much like HN), and didn't turn up ANYTHING by searching on my own name, my son's name, keywords strongly associated with my friends' interests, or anything else likely to turn up something we wrote out of turn. Now I'm actually beginning to trust Facebook privacy settings again--at least for smart users--after using your tool and the new Give Me My Data app<p><a href=""http://givememydata.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://givememydata.com/</a><p>to see what can be seen about me on Facebook.<p>Great work to make such an interesting tool. And, yes, putting the ""rectal surgery"" example on your webpage is funny and gets the point across very well.",1273809612
