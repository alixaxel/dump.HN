For example, I never learned to speak French fluently, but because I have some background in a latin-based language, I found it easier to learn Spanish.<p>It's much easier to relate existing words in your vocabulary with new foreign words, than it is to memorize them outright.

The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive the same amount of nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise.""<p>Again, there is no safe form of smoking, but all evidence points to the fact that smoking cigarettes made from American tobacco is vastly more dangerous than the ways in which people have used tobacco historically.",1274904953
