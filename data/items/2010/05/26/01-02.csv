1379280,comment,1377870,1378863,0,0,viraptor,,,"I agree with many things... especially the editor complaint. I wanted to create a syntax-aware editor one day and it's considerably harder than creating a standard one. It's also almost useless in case of dynamic languages, since you cannot verify that much at the editing stage. But this seems just wrong:<p>> <i>I hate languages that do now allow me to do something, just because the language ""designer"" decided so.</i><p>In many cases it's not about ""designer decided so"", but rather about tradeoffs. We cannot do X, because that would make Y considerably more difficult / fragile / slower. It also helps create some coding standards and common constructs. For example it's easier to read someone else's python code where the syntax is pretty much minimal and uses the same concepts over and over again (decorators are just functions in functions, decorators with parameters just call another wrapping function to get the decorator, etc.), rather than reading some haskell code, where someone decided to build own DSL which implements everything.

1379234,comment,1378819,1379124,0,0,ghshephard,,,"So, the one painful part of Jira, that Atlassian really needs to do something about, (And I say this as a Die-Hard Jira fan with four years of absolute devotion to the product) is the simplification of their field-issuetype-screen-schemes, as well as the myriad other schemes.   It took me over a year, and at least five or six sessions of sketching it out onto paper, before I was able to mentally map Custom-Fields, Screens, Issue Types, Priorities, Resolutions, Statuses,workflows  and their various schemes in my head.  One part that makes it problematic, is Jira is not _consistent_ in how you map schemes to collections of atomic elements like Statuses or Resolutions (Their are no IssueType-Status-Schems, or IssueType-Resolution-Schemes, but there are Field Configuration Schemes, and IssueTypeScreenSchemes)<p>But, with that one exception, the software is a delight.  Fast, even on a tiny platform.  Takes 3 minutes to install (The hardest two steps are setting your JAVA_HOME variable and mapping your Server Directory in a config file) - works on WIndows, Linux, Mac with zero issue.  Very extensible, great plugin community.  The new 4.x JQL makes sophisticated queries against your issue database a dream.<p>And it scales well - Our three  Gigabyte Memory, 12 Gigabyte Disk VMware Machine has added 18,962 issues this year, and continues to feel light (Now totalling 68,495 issues).<p>I can type a query like ""+VPN +Bandwidth"" - and get an answer back in about 2 seconds (Thanks Lucene!) - this with a full text search of all the comments, descriptions, and summaries.<p>I love the product so much that I even enjoy the people who have issues with it - Nothing better than to have someone point out a problem, and then come back with a 15 second solution that also provides the foundation for solving a whole host of other problems.<p>It has my recommendations with only minor reservations regarding the complexity (and inconsistency) of their schemes.<p>Remedy, on the other hand, gets no recommendations whatsoever for their out-of-the-box implementation.

Also, the JVM is a great platform, and you can target it with any number of languages: Groovy, Clojure, Scala, Nice, JRuby, Jython, etc.<p>Personally I'm using Groovy on Grails for the web front-end part(s) of my current project, and even using Groovy for some of the ""backend'ish"" parts just to get through the initial prototype.  Grails and Groovy are amazing in terms of developer speed - compared to Java anyway.  But since it's all still on the JVM, I can just drop in existing Java libraries and - if, or when - I need to, it'll be fairly easy to transition bits to Java.   For my money, it's the best of both worlds at the moment.<p>Then again, the stuff I'm doing is somewhat ""enterprisey"" so being on the JVM will probably actually be a selling point down the road.",1274836720

1379214,comment,1378815,1378815,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"I once wrote some blogposts [1] titled  ""Why do Startups still use Java? "". I would have thought people who wanted the Java libraries/JVM would have used Scala or Clojure. I understand why people would choose Java over say Python (the need for specific libraries like say Hadoop which have no direct equivalent in Python/C land), but I've not yet understood why they won't use Clojure or Scala once they choose the JVM.<p>I wasn't (and am not) running a startup so I asked  some friends who were (and were using Java). I never got a satisfactory answer (but I got some <i>surprising</i> answers including ""If I were 5 years younger I would be using Scala or Clojure but I am very productive in Java and don't have the energy to learn new languages""(!!)). Another interesting answer I got was that their startup focused on business value but needed only average programmers (I am just reporting what people said) and could very well work in Java. All answers tended to ""Sure Java is inferior but there are mitigating factors.""<p>Fwiw, If I were to ever start a business where software was a differentiator I would use (a) Scala (if JVM/libraries were important) (b) Haskell + C or (c) use a custom Scheme  variant I've been hacking on for many years + C.<p>I personally think the fears of not getting good programmers if you build in unusual languages is overblown. Even in Bangalore, good programmers would jump at an opportunity to work on interesting systems and interesting languages. I am not looking for work but  I would <i>still</i> consider a job offer from a  startup using interesting languages very seriously.<p>[1]  I was trying to figure out stuff by writing and so these posts are not  polished, but if anyone wants to read, here they are<p><a href=""http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-do-startups-still-use-java.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-do-startups-still...</a><p><a href=""http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-do-startups-still-use-java-part-2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-do-startups-still...</a><p><a href=""http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-do-startups-still-use-java-part-3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-do-startups-still...</a><p><a href=""http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-do-startups-still-use-java-part-4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pindancing.blogspot.com/2009/07/why-do-startups-still...</a>",1274836560

I was testing if a variable I declared as an integer was less than 0. To my knowledge, every number literal in C is assumed to be of a signed type unless followed by a 'u'. But now I know better. 0 is the exception.",1274836543

1379209,comment,1378815,1378815,0,0,scheff,,,"I'm going to go against the grain by saying I have created a startup in Java. Why Java? Mostly because it's what I'm competent in, not because it's the best ""startup"" material.<p>But what I have done is built a framework for a website which I can easily extend. The framework is robust and easy to adapt, so once I get my first startup up and running, I can punch out more in a much quicker turn-around.<p>I refrained from using a bunch of existing java frameworks/technology to speed up development because I didn't know what the end product would look like and don't like the way frameworks railroad you into a particular solution and prevent you from ""thinking outside the box"".<p>So it's very old school - Servlets and JSP.<p>I achieve agility by now just focussing on delivering new services, and calling those services from either JSP or AJAX calls. This gives me some flexibility in the UX.<p>I prototype very rapidly to prove that I can do what I want to do, then round off the edges if I'm happy that it's functionality that I want to include in the pool.<p>I can turn around new functionality in a matter of hours for the most part.<p>Pete.",1274836377

I mean, it's a measure of the number of times someone searches for ""PHP"" relative to all other search terms, right?  You'd get the same shape if the raw number of searches on ""PHP"" have remained more or less constant while the number of non-PHP searches have gone up, for instance, because the ratio of techies to non-techies on the internet has declined.<p>For example, if you factor out the seasonal fluctuations, calculus and physics have also ""lost ground"":<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends?q=calculus&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends?q=calculus&ctab=0&geo=a...</a><p><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends?q=physics&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends?q=physics&ctab=0&geo=al...</a><p>In fact, Linux and Unix have lost significant ground by this metric as well:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends?q=linux&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends?q=linux&ctab=0&geo=all&...</a><p><a href=""http://www.google.com/trends?q=unix&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/trends?q=unix&ctab=0&geo=all&#...</a><p>The langpop data doesn't go back as far, but suggests that PHP is more popular than 2-3 years ago: <a href=""http://langpop.com/timeline.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://langpop.com/timeline.html</a><p>I don't know if PHP is more or less popular than it was 6 years ago, but I suspect Google trends doesn't either.",1274835683
