I was going to a guy's code yesterday and I felt very _irritated_ to read it, that i ended up spending 15min indenting it myself. I'm sure a lot of people don't like unindented code.<p>and I totally agree with #1, it's very true for me. And especially when I've used some framework and the framework has been updated to a newer version with lots of goodies, i feel lazy to maintain code that been written in older version of the framework. (and even more lazier to update it to the new framework if it requires lots of changes). I just leave it working fine in it's current state. Seems like thats what results in legacy software. So I now follow my new rule-- working on beta versions of frameworks so that i can leave it unmaintained for longer time and spend the time on new ideas.",1274871534

In the context it's often used (the web browser) it supports callbacks, but not with some special semantic. Just callbacks, anonymous functions.<p>For this point of view I think that languages with coroutines are probably more powerful as event-driven programming languages, because it's possible to save the state across calls in a much more high level way, leading to code resembling a lot erlang code for instance.<p>Thanks!",1274871170

Because of the way linkers work and the way standard libraries are designed, if you define your own version of a library function then the linker won't pull in the library version--effectively choosing your local version over the one in the library. That keeps the standard library clean of patches and keeps the small, tight code near the project that actually needs it.",1274868508

How does it enrich us to know that someone mis-implemented memset() in a bootloader that possibly never even calls it, or if it does, probably passes zero as the argument anyway? (Or is dead code because on any arch anyone uses, memset() is implemented in asm.)",1274868478

You will be ask to choose an area code or city and your fax number will based on your choice. Not sure how they're able to profit with that kind of pricing but I guess they are hoping to convert some of those to upgrade to Onesuite Fax Plus which charges 2.5c per page sent.<p>Right now, you can only send fax through Onesuite fax program, if I can send through my email without the program (when I'm not using my computer) then it would be perfect.

(Similarly, other GPL’d apps that may exist in the app store via unofficial ports or forks.)<p>What’s Apple to lose if a user or developer of an open-source GPL’d application mistakenly pushes said application to the App Store? That is, until another a copyright holder or another developer calls foul.<p>I’m interested to see how this plays out between the FSF and Apple. Some murky territory we’re getting into regarding Apple regulation on licensing & copyright claims.",1274868149
