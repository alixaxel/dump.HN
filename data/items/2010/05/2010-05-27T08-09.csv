They have lot of money from their ads, so they can create product in another category (for example GPS), and offer it for free, while other companies who don't have those advertising dollars can't offer their product for free. Basically they can easily kill competition in certain niches, since they can support their product by money gained by another product (Adsense/Adwords).

Many common CEO responsibilities (particularly reviewing financials and signing off strategy) may be done by other directors / partners etc.<p>Where relevant, we also encourage clients to consider rotating CEOs. It's something we've done in our coaching company (which is large enough to have a full time CEO), and it means the role of CEO isn't the pinnacle, subject to office politics and power trips, and that post-CEO our coaches find other ways to contribute within the company (including going back to business coaching operationally).",1274950390
1383078,comment,1383064,1383064,0,0,drKarl,,,"In fact, moral based on religion is completely arbitrary. Some years ago I read a book titled ""Cows, Pigs, Wars, and Witches: The Riddles of Culture"" by the anthropologist Marvin Harris, where he explained that the reason why it is forbidden for muslims and jews to eat pork, is because those religions where originated in a desertic land, and pigs roll over themselves in mud where they are hot, and if there is no mud they roll over themselves in their own feces, which is a danger to health. That health rule became a part of the religious rules, and thus followers of these religions shall not eat pork even if they are living in a different place.
Religion alone has caused more suffering in history than any other idea, and has lead to wars, deaths, torture, discrimination, intolerance, sexual repression, sexist discrimination to women, and a slowdown for science, culture and knowledge. How is that moral acceptable?",1274950390

When you are just out of the gate, building a product and getting your first customers having titles is silly.<p>At a later stage it makes good sense. Whether or not 'investors want a CEO' depends on a lot of factors, the most important one being what stage the company is in, as soon as you incorporate you'll need a 'signing officer' (or two, or three, depending on the law), and maybe one of the people in the company is preferred for that role and so a natural transition from co-founder status to a CEO role is established. Don't be surprised if the guy that ends up in that chair is <i>not</i> the guy you originally envisioned.<p>There are lots of situations in which investors <i>don't</i> want a CEO. Two co-founders looking for seed capital are going to have a problem getting themselves taken serious if one of them labels himself CEO and one of them labels himself CTO. Too many chiefs, no Indians.<p>Agreed that having 'two captains' is not ideal, but should there be so much conflict that this is a problem the titles don't matter much. When your 'other half' walks out you have a problem regardless, and a title used to force an issue is not going to help in this respect.<p>Finally, the title of CEO of a successful company is useful when starting a new company, it becomes part of your track record, and a successful company will have a CEO, but you first have to get to that stage. And a good CTO is just as valuable as a good CEO, to weigh the role of CEO as fully 20 times as important as that of the other co-founders is not at all in line with my experience.",1274948980

Static typing doesn't help when speaking about inline caches for virtual calls (most method calls in a typical Java app) ... it only helps on the initial method lookup because you're dealing with a vtable instead of a hash (that's because at least you know the interface at compile-time).<p>But to do code-inlining and other such optimizations, the Hotspot JVM only compiles bytecode that has been profiled. That's because jitting itself is an expensive operation and you can't just redo it after you've inferred the conditions of a potential call-site cache, being more efficient to just first interpret that code until you have enough data.<p>Thus the long warmup time. But what works in a desktop/server environment doesn't necessarily work on a mobile phone with much less constrained resources ... and unfortunately Moore's law in the mobile world goes to increased battery life instead of increased processing power / bigger or faster RAM.<p>I still think Java was a poor language choice for Dalvik precisely because methods in Java are implicitly virtual and because you can't have custom stack-allocated values.

It doesn't know where it's going, so it's meaningless how well it gets there.<p>Microsoft, for better or worse, is still in the driver seat.  In terms of market share, Apple is a rounding error.  But they inspire. They are exciting people about the future.   When was the last time Microsoft did that?  This isn't just about share price; it's about perceptions by investors, customers, employees -- everyone.  They need to inspire again.",1274947750

I figure at this point I've ""invested"" $48,000 in opportunity cost. Though the app is making about $1000/day, the company has run out of cash and I've been asked to stay on for a few months while they look for investment. So, they're offering some equity. (I would have received some anyway for working at half my rate for 8 months.) I really have no idea how should start to valuate how much I should be looking for. It seems to me at this point I'm more a partner in this thing if I'm actually working for free and have already invested $48k as opposed to an employee you'd throw a few shares at for incentive. Any thoughts?",1274947331
