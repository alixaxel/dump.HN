At this point there are companies inside of YC that have grown larger and been around longer than Viaweb was, so not only are you <i>able</i> to get advice from folks other than the YC founders, there's an emerging set of people who are in some aspects <i>more</i> experienced.  (Though, naturally none who have seen more early phase startups up close.)<p>That's one of those surprising emergent properties that I think will be of increasing import as the trend continues upwards and also has an effect of distributing the load on the YC founders.",1274489951

In a few years a $200 subsidized iPhone might be a high priced product compared to a free with contract Android phone. The iPad at $499 might be a premium device compared to a <$200 netbook. The sales of traditional PCs will eventually start to drop as these other devices fill people's needs. We're probably near the high water mark for the Macintosh. Standalone iPods are already starting to seem old fashioned. How many more years can they rely on that market to exist? It doesn't seem the iTunes Store has ever been especially profitable for Apple either. They have to bet their future on the iPad/iPhone.",1274489767

There is a lot of room for improvement there and it would boost natural language processing a lot to have the tech to do that.<p>Any piece of tech has interesting components, but that's a relatively small part of the whole, and the money is made in the drudge-work, that was exactly the point.<p>From a start-up perspective, the 'core' engine of the product is probably relatively complete by launch day, but the infrastructure to make it scale, to market and monetize it, which is going to be a whole lot less sexy, is where the money eventually will come from.",1274489753

At $135, it was more than a dollar per piece of paper, and smaller than a volume of poetry, with decently sized text and a good layout. But make no mistake--it could kill a man, and it was well worth every penny.<p>It's not an exaggeration to say that you could spend a whole hour working through a single page, and in fact that's what the first day in my Real Analysis class was: learning how hardcore math is really done. It has an astonishing economy of expression, where everything you need to understand a proof is written, but if you blink you'll have to start over. It doesn't just feed you facts and theorems to memorize. Skill is developed in the process of reading, because reading this book requires unpacking explanations, filling in details, and making connections for yourself.<p>The closest analogy I can make is that it's like watching a grandmaster play a real game of chess, when all your previous chess lessons had been finding the correct four moves from a handful of common positions. It's not necessarily the best or easiest way to learn real analysis itself, but having learned real analysis from that book, you are prepared to not only learn, but master, any other type of math you happen to come across.<p>Requiescat in pace.",1274488517

He needed the power of Simula, but at the time Simula implementations didn't scale.  He took the ideas he found useful in the language and put some into C, as he was building large scale C/BCPL applications.<p>To me that's the definition of building a language for yourself.  You actually write a language that you need to solve a specific problem you have.<p>And I find his categorization of good vs bad languages somewhat absurd.  What actually makes Ada, C++, and Pascal bad?  His lack of understanding?  What makes C, Perl, and Lisp good?  The inverse?<p>While I have my own personal prefernces with respect to languages, I fully believe a large part of it is familiarity.

In English, there's ""big, large, enormous, huge, gigantic, gargantuan, grand"", and about a dozen others. In Chinese, if something is big, it's '大 (da)', or maybe 'very big'. Except the great wall, which is the ""long wall"" (not big).<p>- If something is ""good"", it's ""好 (hao)"", or ""really good"", or ""very good"", or ""double good"" or possibly ""佳 (jia)"".
