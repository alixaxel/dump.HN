1391065,comment,1389583,1389667,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Having slept on the idea and read some more news this morning, I'm much less optimistic about it :-(<p>I'm struck by the fact that there are other oil plumes nearby on the seabed, eg 400 feet away from the big one. If the borehole itself is damaged and oil is also leaking out through cracks in the ocean floor, then successfully capping the wellhead will just increase the outward pressure to other leaks, and we'll end up playing whack-a-mole. Depending on how porous or fractured the ground is in the area around the well, attempting to just cap it may be futile.<p>Indeed, it seems as if the latest strategy is the mentioned here of dropping a giant funnel on it and sucking up as much oil as possible through a pipe rather than allowing it to diffuse into the water, while we try to get an/other rig(s) in place to drill relief wells. And the estimate of having that done by August is based on the time it took to perform a similar task in much shallower water. The explosion in April took place about 3 months after drilling began, and while BP began drilling a relief well around the first week of May, there's no guarantee that any individual drill will tap into the same pocket on the first attempt, which I presume is why the government has ordered they get a second one going ASAP. The Ixtoc I oil spill in the 1970s, which was also in the gulf, took 10 months to bring under control. Although our drilling and seismic imaging technology has improved significantly since then, they're also applied to wells at much greater depths.",1275251245

And as I understand it, G Voice is not a VoIP solution yet.  (And that's not to say I agree with it being blocked.  On the contrary, their UI — the supposed rejection reason — doesn't look much different from the other dialer apps, including Skype.)<p>As far as ""competing VoIP solutions"", it's not like Apple is competing in the VoIP arena; they seem perfectly content to let other companies battle it out.",1275250026

Ditched the idea because the available ""IDEs"" are not yet very matured (bought a MacBook instead). I'm sure this will change in future. An IDE for web coding could be even implemented as a browser app, as long as you do the sftp stuff in server side. Full keyboard support (shortcuts for everything) is major requirement, because you want to keep your fingers on your bluetooth keyboard. Not a problem for web app, though.<p>Oh, and you won't really need integrated development environment if Apple enabled multitasking for every app + makes possible to switch application on external keyboard (i.e. support for cmd+tab). Then separate apps would do fine.",1275249821
