Not so with infinity.<p>Again, Rider has set me straight that I need to learn more.

Some kids are good at math, but do not like writing. And vice versa. A little boy might be doing algebra very early, but does not like nonfiction. Give him time! Let him work out his math and progress with it, perhaps he'd get interested in reading a biography of a mathematician or scientist at some point.<p>Likewise, maybe another boy is reading and writing at an advanced pace, is devouring classic works, but is behind in math ""for his age"" - that's okay! Give him time. If he needs more time in arithmetic or doing long division by hand, let him spend time there while reading at a high level. He'll get there.<p>Subdividing based on age is asinine and crazy. It means a majority of people will be studying at a skill level incorrect for them in an important discipline. That's before even considering how boring school is for most kids.<p>Me? I loved physics, liked chemistry, and hated biology. Because the way it was taught, physics was cool with acceleration, chemistry was interesting in terms of mixing things, but biology was a bunch of boring memorization of genome and species and things like that which didn't seem very important to me. So, I really enjoyed my Freshman ""introductory earth sciences"" (physics, chemistry, and a little geology if I remember correctly) and had a fun and enjoyable time, but then I was forced to move into rote memorization biology my sophomore year... I tried to skip ahead to physics, but they said no. Long story short, I wound up dropping out of two high schools, and got into a university despite that before dropping out of there too. Was a great decision for me! The school system is broken - it doesn't meet kids where they're at or where they want to be. Instead, it forces a strict curriculum that requires memorization and obedience to pass.<p>Look at home schooling if you want inspiration. There's a big community devoted to it, and home schooled <i>destroy</i> mainstream teaching methods on almost every metric except for social interaction/emotional maturity. (A big problem for homeschooling, parents need to be diligent in getting their kids representative social experiences if they're home skilled, at least enough for them to relate to other people their age)<p>But that's really it - on just about every other metric, home schooling wrecks on mainstream teaching methods. I think the biggest problem is that mainstream schooling instruction is bureaucratic centrally planned with age being the overwhelmingly important decision on what the kids learn.<p>How asinine! Everyone goes through cycles of being interested in different things. If a kid has a knack for language and is doing hardcore immersion, learning the Chinese characters that will let them read/write Mandarin, Cantonese, and Japanese, and they're learning Mandarin and Japanese at a high level and starting to read literature in the native languages... do you really want to break that up because now it's time for geometry?<p>You introduce the kids to a little bit here and there, when they're ready for it they learn it. Learning is one of the most exciting and coolest things in the world. The fact that schools somewhat make learning dreadful and boring is one of the most laughable things in the world. But again, you've got to meet the student where he is at. Statistics can be taught via sports, or via census data, or via business, or via hard science experiments, or... y'know? You've got to find one that stimulates the pupil. One training going 100 kilometers per hour towards another one going 180 kilometers per hour isn't going to get it done for the vast majority of kids.",1273492193

You can't go any further, it's all there is.  People talk about parallel lines ""meeting at infinity"" and ""there is no last point on the line"" sort of thing.<p>And that's what their intuition is telling them.  There's nothing beyond infinity.<p>Then when we talk about the cardinals we tend to reinforce that by showing that the odds, evens, squares and primes all have the same cardinality.  That's a bit weird for people, but they're getting the idea that infinity is odd, but they can cope with odd.<p>Then we show that N^2 and Q are both countable, can be put in one-one correspondence with N.  They're getting cool with that too.  We continue to reinforce the idea that there's infinity, and every time we do something we get the same infinity.<p>But that's now what they expect.  Infinity is kind of as far as you can go.  We're matching the set-theoretic cardinals to their geometrical intuition of ""out there.""<p>No wonder they get confused, upset, and occasionally angry when we then introduce 2^N as being ""bigger.""<p>I'm finding that talking about geometry and the concept of infinity, then talking about sets and the concept of intinity <i>as a different thing, despite the same name</i> is helping people to create different models in their minds.  These different models then help them <i>not</i> use the same intuition, and they don't get confused in the same way.<p>Then, as the final modification, I don't start by showing that loads and loads of things are all countable.  I talk about ""same size"" as being 1-1 matching, and discuss the idea that there could be something ""bigger than N.""<p>I do that first, and then go hunting, pointing out from the beginning that historically people found this difficult.<p>Now they get excited when I show them that 2^N is uncountable.  They've been primed to want to find it, and their intuition about ""infinity"" isn't challenged.<p>That's an incomplete summary - I hope it helps.

I simply think that everyone engaged in science, from the lofty Nobel Prize winner to the first-year graduate student grunt worker, has to be prepared to follow correct methodology, each day and every day.<p>It happens, among all subjects that are researched, that I am most familiar with the research on psychology of human abilities and education reform (especially the intersection of those subjects, education of gifted children). Most of what passes for ""research"" in those subjects is appallingly bad from a methodological point of view. I've seen very influential publications with recommendations on gifted education that consist entirely of ""fudge""--made-up citations that can't be verified if you look at the cited journals, and ""studies"" with no description of how the data were observed at all.<p>When a press release writes ""According to a 2003 study,"" I immediately look for a citation of the study. Scientific studies that get published all have citations. Serious scholars cite that which is published. My alarm bells went off when I didn't see any citation to any study to back up that extremely implausible point. If you want to talk about priors, my statement is that it is EXTREMELY implausible that ""a mere 40 percent of gifted children will complete an undergraduate degree"" by any reasonable definition of ""gifted."" There are severe economic limitations on college access for some learners (cited by me in another post in this thread).

I suppose I wondering why there isn't the computer equivalent of a space elevator. That is something most people know about that can't be done with current tech but is physically plausible (but might still might be too hard to do). Something that might spark the equivalent of the spaceward foundation, but for computers.<p>The fleet architecture represents a different face of unconventional computing. One that geeks can get behind. However it concentrates on speed of processing. Looking at the costs of computing, increasing computational power per watt or flops is useful but does not address the dominant cost of owning and running a computer. The dominant costs, I think, are the costs of learning the system, administering them and programming them. This is not addressed by either of the above threads of research.<p>I have my own odd-ball ideas. Which I'm excited about. I just wanted to gauge opinion of HN type people.",1273490096
