1352546,comment,1351917,1352042,0,0,wallflower,,,"As an iPhone developer, who developed the skill through
brute-force experience and trial through throwing away lots of code, I wonder why Google doesn't take advantage of this. Currently, the iPhone SDK is better than the Android's SDK. Similar to the high value of Microsoft Visual Studio integrating everything into a true integrated environment, the iPhone SDK is much closer to Microsoft Visual Studio-like than the Android SDK.<p>Overnight, Google could start to change this underdog status. Why doesn't Google buy Appcelerator's Titanium or Phonegap? By buying a software tool company that makes it much easier to write Android apps, Google could show up in force for the battlefield of developer mindshare and consumer experience, by giving away the tool free and sponsoring conferences, contests, bloggers, heck even venture capital for Android-focus companies.<p>In the long run, because of their carpet bombing approach with devices, Google will earn the majority share of smart mobile device operating systems. Why not accelerate the process by making it easier for developers to make something? Not everyone is above-average when it comes to software development - why not make the Visual Basic for mobile platforms. I argue that Visual Basic was a key linchpin of Microsoft's Windows dominance. Before Visual Basic, you had to use the Windows API or (yes, a third-party app framework) like Foxpro.",1274035941

Are you being ironic?<p>Hey, I'm not an expert, but does calling up major supporters with incendiary allegations strike you as the behavior of a news organization? Are they doing this to bring important information to the public?<p>I work at the Wikimedia Foundation. I do not speak for the organization -- I'm just a programmer -- but these are my own impressions.<p>First, I've heard from our press guy that Fox News hasn't called the WMF <i>once</i> for any comment on this story.<p>Also, the atmosphere in the office isn't exactly ""chaos"", as the article alleges. Lots of other business is proceeding normally, like the revamp of the Wikipedia interface that went live last week.<p>I'm just a hired hand, and not much of an expert on the Wiki* communities, but it seems to me that Fox News is reigniting an <i>existing</i> debate about how to manage the tiny, tiny minority of Wikimedia Commons images that could cause offense to people. We're talking about a website where the biggest news of last month was that some guy donated his collection of images of rocks and minerals.<p>Jimmy Wales decided to do a purge on his own authority, but was widely criticized for overshooting what was needed. This provoked another meta-debate about founder authority. So he voluntarily gave up his ""founder flag"" rights, so the debate could get back on track. There's been a lot of very frank discussion, which is how Wikimedia lists are <i>all the time</i>, but Fox News is focusing on only the divisive aspects, which are already way out of date in my opinion. Some (not all) community members who were very vocally displeased a few days ago are now happier with how things are proceeding. And are back contributing to the main work of the site, you know, that whole free knowledge thing.<p>And that's where things sit as of this moment, to my knowledge. People are still working out what changes to practices are necessary.",1274035571

As FraaJad said there are no short-cuts and no tricks.<p>Let me start by saying that you can't be self-employed. The US immigration service is employment based which means you have to have an employer to sponsor you. There are exceptions to this but you have to be ""an alien of extra-ordinary abilities"" - I am not sure what that entails but regardless of what anyone tells you here, you should talk to a lawyer and you can always ask him/her about it to see if you qualify.<p>Furthermore the H1-B is given for a particular alien for a particular skill-set that can only be applied for the position that the H1-B was petitioned for. That means that you can't work directly on and be compensated for anything that the H1-B petition does not cover - naturally that means any and all side-projects.<p>H1-B's are not handed out in April - the process of applying starts in April - so in theory you can apply for the 2010 H1-B quota starting April 2010 to March 2011. For several years the quota was drying out in less than a month but I don't think that has been true since 2009.<p>My advice - approach a lawyer to see what your options are - you will potentially have to find a company to sponsor your H1-B but that pretty much eliminate any chance of you working on your projects.<p>Lastly - the $2500 is made of two parts - the application fees to the USCIS for the H1-B and the lawyer fees. As far as I understand this - this is a cost that has to be incurred by the company that is sponsoring you. You should know this - furthermore this can be a deal breaker for startups because of<p>a) The cost<p>b) As FreeJad said - the business needs to prove its own viability and it's need to hire a foreign national.
