1333198,comment,1332542,1332542,0,0,slapshot,,,"My personal perspective: I am a Kaiser member (California) and I love it.  It is extremely simple to deal with: if I ever feel sick, I show up at a Kaiser facility and pay a $10 co-pay.  If I need tests, I walk down the hall and pay a $20 co-pay.  There is no billing, no headache, no mess. Everything is in one facility and integrated.  The doctors, nurses, and NPs seem competent, if somewhat busy.<p>That said, I've heard that people with rare and specialized conditions have a harder time navigating the Kaiser system, but I'm not sure that it's any worse with other healthcare systems.<p>Overall, it has made me a believer in the HMO model when properly executed.  And it appears that it takes complete integration for it to work right: the joy of Kaiser is having everything in one building and managed through one system.",1273452744
