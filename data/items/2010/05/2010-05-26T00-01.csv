1379197,comment,1378912,1379177,0,0,humbledrone,,,"It's not hard to type a statement like ""(void)v;"" to explicitly say, ""v is intentionally unused.""  I fail to see the drawback of this approach.  Of course you should only do this when (1) you can't remove the parameter from the function's prototype and (2) there is a good reason for it to be unused.  But once you develop that habit, the compiler can help you catch bugs that are otherwise easy to miss.  Sounds like a worthwhile tradeoff to me.",1274835521

Keep in mind, however, that the web is just a UI layer. What is the UI _for_? It really irks me to see Ruby mentioned _only_ with Rails next to it, as if it wasn't an a very interesting language even without it (the combination of ideas from Perl and Smalltalk).<p>Statically typed languages feel awkward for web development (but then again, I haven't done much web development, so perhaps I am missing some of the better options e.g., Lift), but there's all sorts of interesting libraries for Java/JVM when it comes to:<p>* Middleware/services (Jersey/JAX-RS, Grizzly)<p>* Socket communications (Netty, Mina, Grizzly)<p>* Distributed coordination and communication (JGroups, ZooKeeper)<p>* Search and data processing (several ""NoSQL"" systems, Hadoop, Lucene and Katta for search)<p>* Threading and concurrency: actor libraries like Killim and Jetlang, java.util.concurrent and jsr166y/fork-join framework.<p>It should be noted that you could also use them with Scala. If liked using Java, you'll like Scala even more. Unless, of course, you've already got a predominantly Java project and have a specific reason against mixing/matching Scala (e.g., don't want to have a require having another jar in a servlet container which may be incompatible with the existing Scala jar in that container).<p>Clojure is yet another example of something very interesting that's happening on the JVM, but to me the big pull of Clojure isn't related to it being on the JVM: I like the fact it's a Lisp-1, its STM approach, first-order data structures - with syntactic sugar - beyond lists. Even if you viscerally hate Java and the JVM, you should give Clojure a try.<p>Of course there are a couple of JVM specific issues that <i>are</i> annoying and knee-cap <i>all</i> the JVM languages (in comparison to C, C++, Scheme/CLisp, OCaml and Haskell): lack of unsigned types, lack of ability to create user defined ""primitive types"", erasure with generics (mitigated through work arounds like Scala's implicit) and other artifacts of the JVM imposing a type system on you.<p>Personally I was dismayed by Java's smell (associated with the enterprise CRUD web development that went on in Java in the late 90s/early 2000s, Java's design by committee, etc...) and didn't even touch it until a few years ago; I squarely believed that all _real_ programming could only be done in C or C++ (while Lisp could be used for prototyping algorithms). I found that despite Java's _many_ annoyances, it's a language that could be practical for many non-trivial programs (rather than the usual ""enterprise"" apps which crash when you click the wrong button). Subsequently, I also discovered the same about Erlang, OCaml, Scheme, Common Lisp and languages I previously ignored as toys/glue languages (Python, Ruby, Perl).",1274832650
