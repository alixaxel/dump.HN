1369571,comment,1369338,1369512,0,0,mkramlich,,,"The folks that built the well and platform, who made the mistake that caused the explosion, and the folks who failed to quickly seal/stop/contain the leak are clearly at fault. I think the issue is whether if a company thinks it is smart enough to start a deep sea oil drilling operation (BP/Transocean/Halliburton) that it should also be smart enough to have a tested plan in place to quickly seal a leak -- at any depth they operate it. The argument being if they want to build a well that would be too deep to stop a leak like this, and yet, somehow not too deep enough to build the well in the first place, that they should not build the well there, period.<p>For example, one of my assumptions based on the physics/engineering I do know is that it should be possible to build a simulated leak contraption, at that depth. And then they could run experiments where they try to stop the leak. Since it would be a controlled experiment they could have control valves to turn on/off the flow of oil (or whatever alternate liquid they use), but the key element is that the contraption has a part where it just gushes out thousands of barrels of the oil-like substance, under conditions as close to a real leak as possible. Test, measure, do post-mortems, tweak and fine-tune their plans and gadgets. Then, disseminate a plan, train people, have tools and gadgets cached reasonably nearby all such wells they operate, and be able to move in and take decisive action to seal the leak within the first few days. ""Go big"" if necessary to seal it. Just do it, quickly, because time is of the essence. Have backup procedures also in place, ready to go, with all necessary gadgets and trained folks nearby and ready to go quickly. I do also assume that a company that makes billions in profit each quarter would have enough money to do all of this.<p>I'm mad at them and I am willing to point a finger because I find it really hard to believe they could not have done much better. The combination of brainstorming failure scenarios, testing, planning and having billions of dollars to spend on tech and people should have taken them a lot farther, I think. I just don't buy this ""we have enough brains and money to build this thing, but not enough brains and money to fix it when it goes bad"" argument. The first buys the second, as a general rule. And they've had plenty of time to prepare for the second.",1274492940

1369559,comment,1368051,1369520,0,0,starkfist,,,"It depends what you consider costly. I switched to Japanese after college and moved to Japan for a year. Rather than learning anything about the writing system, I took a 6 week conversation crash course before leaving. When I got there I just mastered the accent and some of the cultural communication idosyncrasies like ""active listening"" rather than spending time reading and writing anything. I ended up going on far more dates with women than I ever have in my life prior (or after) and had two really cool girlfriends. In contrast my friend who was obsessed with mastering Japanese had no friends at all for about 3 years. Nobody wanted to talk to him because his accent was so grating. I feel like his approach was far more ""costly"" if you consider ""social cost"" a real factor.<p>In terms of real economic value I have come to the conclusion that a native english speaker mastering another language rarely pays off, in a financial sense.

All that stuff weighs down on the saturated rock/oil underneath, and then you poke a hole in that hard top layer of rock.<p>The pressures we're talking about are immense, so high that methane in spite of the temperature is a solid.<p>Containing the pressure is the problem.<p>The only places where pumps are needed to get oil out of the ground are shallow wells, especially in a newly drilled well the pressure will almost always be 'on'.<p>The deeper we drill, the higher that initial pressure will be.<p>Over time, as the well is depleted the pressure can go down, and depending on the substrate the oil is in (usually some kind of porous rock, it's not quite drilling in to a lake of oil down there) this will happen faster or slower.<p>Once a well is 'depleted' the rule is really that there is still plenty of oil down there but it can't be moved to the surface economically. There is plenty of research in this area (such as controlled burns to use the gas pressure from the burn to push the oil to a collecting well), but simply pumping it out is usually not the way things go.<p>My personal big fear about this particular 'gusher' is that the longer it lasts the more the oil under pressure has to erode the wellhead, if it gets to the point where it starts widening the well head (like say the tip of a plasma cutter that is used a bit too long) that the cavity will get larger than what can be plugged up.",1274491755

Li and Thompson's Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar (713 pages) is familiar to many English-speaking students of Chinese. It too is far from exhaustive. Many of the mistakes made in speaking standard Chinese by second-language speakers that impair understanding are GRAMMAR mistakes, and that is true even of native speakers of other Sinitic languages (""Chinese dialects"") who don't know Modern Standard Chinese as a first language. And almost half the population of Chinese, according to a survey by the Chinese government, self-rates as unable to converse in Modern Standard Chinese.<p><a href=""http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-03/07/content_5812838...</a><p>Moreover, despite what that article says, written Chinese characters are frequently a barrier to understanding among Chinese citizens from different regions too. There is first of all the problem of high rates of illiteracy in China, because of the old-fashioned writing system Moser mentions. Many literate Chinese persons tend to write in the regional vocabulary and grammar--there is that again--of their native Sinitic language when they write, and I have seen numerous occasions of Chinese people traveling out of region and not being able to read hand-written signs at markets or even printed official signs posted by the local government.",1274491228

They are constantly turning away great startups due to having limited slots.  Upping the amount they invest per startup would only help them if they took commensurately more equity ($80k = 24%+).  With limited slots, they are simple trading great startups with lean-living co-founders for great startups with a higher price tag.<p>Who isn't applying?  The YC process is -- survive 3 months on ~$20k.  Survive 3-4 more months as you raise more money or get to profitability.  Presumably you have savings or friends/family you can borrow from.  How about a HELOC?<p>Honestly, if you can't find some way for 2 people to survive on $20k for 6ish months, you're probably either a pretty lousy life-hacker or you've had some bad luck.
