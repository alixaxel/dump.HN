Meaning, performance is rarely an issue. So, you rarely care about performance. That's fine: performance rarely matters, anyway. When it does, we can still locally optimize.<p>> > And on all other fronts, C++ really sucks.<p>> <i>Stating a claim is no defense of it.</i><p>You're right. <i>This</i> is: <a href=""http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yosefk.com/c++fqa/</a> The writing is quite fun, and the whole thing is actually informative. To sum up, the guy says that for a new project with few dependencies, C++ is almost never the best choice. Meaning, (almost) no niche is best filled by C++. Each one is better served with another language.<p>> <i>Your original point, which I've now quoted twice, was that C++ is inappropriate because many programs don't need to deal with low-level details like memory management. My counterclaim, which you have yet to refute, is that C++ is no obstacle to that end.</i><p>You're right (again). I can't refute that point. Now <i>my</i> point is, that doesn't make C++ appropriate. See, when you don't need to do low-level stuff, many programming languages are vastly simpler, safer, more terse, and more flexible than C++. All at the same time. And you can learn them in no time (you were able to learn C++, after all). So, in that case, C++ isn't the best option. Why bother with it?<p>But still, I wonder how a significant project could avoid to implement some sort of data structure itself (which would mean worry about memory). Do you have any example?<p>> The vast majority of people who blame C++'s design choices don't understand them. Have you read Stroustrup's D&E?<p>I didn't. As I understand it, Stroustrup had some goals, and C++ achieved them. One such goal was to bring Object Orientation to C programmers (the ""masses""). So I won't say that C++ didn't achieve it's purposes. It did. I just say those purposes weren't worth the behemoth that C++ is.<p>Object Orientation for instance, is a mistake. As seen by C++ (and Java), OO encourages high coupling and side effects more than is healthy. And that's before you need to apply one of the baroque design patterns from the GoF book.",1272964968

1317535,comment,1315551,1315551,0,0,diophant,,,"Wow, I never guessed that my simple proof achieved so much resonance! 
You're right in the comments that the proof just shows the NP-hardness. I ommitted the other part of the proof, because it seemed obvious to me - as others already said, you just have to find a solution of the level by nondeterministically ""guessing"" and verifying it. 
Of course, the game levels can get arbitrarily large. You have to assume this for any problem, otherwise there is only a finite (and therefore constant) number of configurations of the problem, and checking them can be done in constant time.
Btw., I also found a direct reduction from directed Hamiltonian cycle. The proof is a little bit more complicated, the idea is that you have to collect a key in each node, and that you can leave each node only once, i.e., leaving a node on one edge will block all other outgoing edges of the node. Another technical difficulty was to create crossing edges. If you are interested in the proof, I'll ask Holger to put the example level in his blog.",1272964932
