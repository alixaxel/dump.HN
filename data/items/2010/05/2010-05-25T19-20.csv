This would have put me in the awkward position of telling the person that thought they had a job lined up that they needed to interview, may or may not get the salary they thought they had locked in, and that they would have to wait at least a week (likely longer) while I considered all other candidates, especially possible internal candidates.<p>And that is before talking about the fact they trained someone who had not yet signed an NDA in our processes and internal workings.  I know in some areas this is not a problem, but in some industries I worked with this could have caused major issues.  In fact, if working with any kind of sensitive data, this could involve actual crimes being comitted.<p>And that is not to mention the fact I would have to then have a long talk with legal about whether or not we needed to pay her for the week of training already done.  And, again I am not a lawyer, but I suspect this could have opened up horrible liability situations if she had actually been injured in an employees only area while being trained without an employment contract.<p>The only saving grace is that most managers generally (I certainly did) have a good enough idea of what is going on in their areas that this would have been caught and corrected within hours instead of an entire week.<p>[Edited for minor grammar and spelling fix]",1274816993

I mean; the only reason this is big news is because Google supplies a <i>lot</i> of sites with analytics. If a site uses another service then this opt out is useless (in terms of them not being tracked). Additionally they are providing all this data to the site directly - Google is just the aggregator some webmasters choose.<p>This is, in fact, about people preferring <i>Google</i> not having their information. Which is a fair enough point (if I visit XYZ.com I don't implicitly agree to provide my data to Google).<p>I think there is a fair gentlemans agreement in place; whereby website owners have a ""reasonable expectation"" to be able to see what kind of users are accessing a site.

1378335,comment,1376911,1377226,0,0,thesethings,,,"Exactly. MUNI (SF's bus service) is by many measures irresponsible, incompetent, and corrupt. It even runs a late a lot.
But the density of the city simply creates such a high frequency of buses, and coverage of routes, that it results in a very practical, pragmatic service to use.
Even really well off people often don't have cars in SF just because having a car is more of a hassle than taking the bus/BART/extremely occasional cab.
We know from Paul's blog (awesome blog, Paul!) that he really likes cars. When even he is thinking of ditching it, it says a lot about the service.<p>Sidebar: I currently live in Portland, which has an award-winning bus/rail service. And it is true, it's awesome. The drivers are polite, and often really care about urban planning/civic stuff. The buses are clean, the documentation/data/maps/API well-done.<p>But because Portland is so much less dense than SF, it still means that in many cases, taking a bus here is more of a drag, and cars more common.

Sometimes the type system feels backwards. What if I don't want the compiler to infer types for my variables? What if I want the opposite, where it does constraint checking on said variables? For example, instead of inferring the type of the elements of a list, it instead makes sure that they all belong to a particular typeclass. This is a subtle but huge difference that makes it difficult for me to program UIs. It can be done, but it seems to take more effort than it does in some other languages.<p>2. Allowing the construction of infinite values leads to some really frustrating errors sometimes. Sometimes you make mistakes of the form ""let x = f x"", which is valid in some situations and not others.<p>3. Monad should imply Applicative should imply Functor.<p>4. Bytestring handling bites you in the ass sometimes and you don't know it until your program crashes because you mixed things up improperly. Something is wrong here, when we are losing type information that should have prevented this.<p>5.

You can't advocate privacy and provide privacy tools while at the same time promoting analytics and data-mining tools used because of a lack of privacy.  Ultimately, the two sides conflict and the end result is often bad for both sides.<p>Case in point -- IronPort used to be a company selling spam cannons, and then they started selling anti-spam devices.  They quickly realized they had to stop selling the spam cannons if they wanted to be perceived as the anti-spam vendor of choice.",1274814214

The author appears to believe having a lisp which ~5x-10x slower is a worthwhile tradeoff to make if the underlying lisp is simpler, more flexible and more expressive.

Oil <i>is</i> energy inputs; if the EROEI drops too low we can't replace it until we find <i>more</i> than the energy we're currently getting from it from non-petroleum-based sources.
