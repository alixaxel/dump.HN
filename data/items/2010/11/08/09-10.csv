1881965,comment,1880096,1880643,0,0,roel_v,,,"""Also, it's been my experience that clients care about the price before the project begins, but never after.""<p>I agree, and from both sides of the table. I've provided added services to projects where the total value of the added services were a multiple of the initial cost, without getting any complaints or requests to lower the budget. I've also paid many extra hours for additional work and never felt bad about paying for any of it; and I'm very cost conscious and drive a hard bargainer when I get an initial offer.<p>I think it's a trust thing, after the other person has shown that they're capable of providing high quality services, cost is not so important any more, while if you're just getting quotes from people, you have no way to find out the true qualities of the people you're asking (usually). Even references from people you know personally sometimes end up blowing up in your face, a guy may be having a bad day when he's working on your project, screw up and refuse to fix it. Relationship-breaker right there, while he may have done an (objectively) great job at your brother in law's project last year.",1289210242
1881964,comment,1879836,1880193,0,0,cheald,,,"I think the real danger here to Apple is that due to devices like this, Android could decisively unseat the iPhone as ""the smartphone"" in the public consciousness. Right now, when you say ""smartphone with apps"", I suspect that most people will mentally jump to the iPhone. If these sorts of low-end, low-cost device/plan packages go big (and they will), it'll rapidly erode the iPhone's carefully-curated image as ""the smartphone platform"". Android has been chipping away at it for a while now, but if you capture the low-income-but-tired-of-the-RAZR market (hi, high school and college market), then you more or less have captured the entire direction of the market.<p>Apple will continue to sell iPhones, and will continue to be successful at it, but it won't be the market-dominating behemoth it's been in the past couple of years.",1289210222

I'm more in agreement with you than the author, but I voted up the article for this line which is a gem:<p>> Any client will have grand dreams of his product. He will constantly ask for new things, and think those were naturally implied from his vague sketches. If you have quoted a fixed price, and you were smart enough to have a detailed contract, you will need to fight him on every step, saying ""we didn't spec that"". Whereas, with an hourly rate, you can say ""sure, let me estimate how much will this be"". The client can then decide if it's worth the money.<p>Perhaps his method is better for projects with unclear scopes or first time buyers, and yours for clear scopes and veteran buyers?

Assuming, for ease of math, that translates to around $33 million a year, that puts their P/E at around 1000.<p>Their strategy seems to be a combination of ad space sales, and the sales of Facebook credits, although they've stated that the majority of their revenue comes from advertising.  I'm very skeptical that advertising is the kind of business model that can meet that level of speculation.<p>Do you feel this is an incorrect set of conclusions, given the information culled from Facebook's representatives?  Or do you feel that I've overlooked information about it's strategy or revenues?  If you have information that conflicts, or adds to this, I'd be very interested, as I'm sure many people here would be.",1289207351

While it does not create quite the compactness of the Closure compiler it does get you close without enforcing constraint on the way you write JS.<p>As well, if you are doing large apps with jQuery then you should take a look at Backbone. It helps organize the JS application architecture. In saying that though there really are better toolkits for large JS apps that are designed to provide the frameworks of application architecture in your app.<p>Dojo is the one that I use and recommend, once over the learning curve you will find that it is designed to handle large JS application is an intuitive manner and not just by making it look like Java in the browser. It exploits the best parts of Javascript while bringing in language constructs from several schools of thought to provide a very robust toolkit.<p>I have used most all of them and it is my choice when the webapp surpasses a certain point in complexity. I always tell people that I can save them a lot of time when it comes to JS toolkit selection and then I tell them if it's small use jQuery and if it's large use Dojo. It is meant to be slightly humorous but there is a grain of truth to it.<p>There is nothing faster to learn and more intuitive that jQuery but it comes at the cost of reduction in it's robustness. There are tools to address this but to me they always feel like bolt on's.<p>Dojo on the other hand trades up front intuitiveness for robustness. A trade off that toolkits like Closure make is to make JS more like Java to bring back some of that intuitiveness but at the cost of some of that robustness. Dojo is unapologetic a JS toolkit and uses JS concepts as first class citizens. It then borrows best of class language constructs from other areas of language progression.<p>Anyway, my long winded point is, if you are having issue with growth of your jQuery application you may want to give Dojo a try.
