In other words, thinking about it as (1) drawing energy from the wind and transforming this energy into forward physical motion instead of (2) the wind pushing something faster than itself.",1289215001

1882104,comment,1879764,1881976,0,0,Kliment,,,"Given I practice with both, this is very true. And it's not just that they see it coming. But the parent to my original comment was noting it was just a pocketknife, not a sword or something. A small knife can do way more damage at close range, is nearly impossible to parry when in distance, and moves crazy fast. The saying goes that if you get into a knife fight, you will get cut, and you might die. Regardless if you win the fight.<p>EDIT: I now notice it was you that made that original comment, so I'll answer that: A knife that opens with little effort and then locks into place allows for one-handed arming and stabbing, without the risk that the blade will snap back and cut the user. It also enables a blade the length of the handle to be stored in space slightly more than the length of the handle itself. A blade of the length of your typical pocket is considered sufficient to easily cause fatal damage even when used by an untrained fighter. In many countries there are exceptions for knives that require two hands to open, or where the blade must be held in place during usage or where the blade is below some set total length. The UK has fairly strict restrictions on knives in general, so most of those exceptions do not apply.",1289214930

The service I am developing is server side in order to be able to use it on mobile phones (do you know of any?)<p>I have some doubts about how useful this service can be, so if you could make some suggestions and clarify a bit, it would help me a lot.<p>1) Do you find this service useful to have it on a mobile phone? Or maybe you use the increased/decreased playback rate only on long videos that you usually watch at home?<p>2) I know HTML5 is getting better and better support and that video/audio elements have a playbackRate attribute, but I was wondering if you think this can (on the short-term at least) be implemented on mobile platforms (limitations due to CPU, battery life, etc.)<p>Any other suggestions or thoughts are highly appreciated :)<p>Thank you!",1289214023
