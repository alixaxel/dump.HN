I don't think a fine effectively gets across the point that battery and vandalism are <i>crimes</i>, not minor violations like jaywalking. $200 is a speeding ticket, and to some upper-middle class teenagers, little more than pocket change.

1881553,comment,1880334,1880630,0,0,8ren,,,"IMHO the difficult part is seeing the commonality of those edge cases. That requires firstly knowing about the edge cases, and secondly seeing the problem (the commonality of those cases). The final step is a solution, which is where the maths comes in (or might).<p>Anecdotally, it seems fairly common that maths is independently re-invented by people applying it - famously for relativity, IIRC. That's because the maths guys don't actually know about the applications.<p>It's a truism for our industry that if a new approach really is significantly better (eg. x10) <i>in practice</i>, it will be adopted. You don't need to convince people; you just beat them. OTOH, there's a common wish to over-automate: to spend a week saving a second, and then it turns out to not handle the very next case. So, some people don't like to use frameworks because they are too constricting (don't handle all the cases <i>in practice</i>); and some (Alan Kay) even say if you <i>can</i> build your own infrastructure, you <i>should</i>.<p>Mathematical ideas usually only work on their own assumptions - a difficult part is matching those assumptions to an application. Though maybe this isn't a problem for the generics example.<p>There's also incidental practical issues, like the need to ship, then of back-compatibility, resulting in a current Java implementation that can't express <i>List<Circle|Rect></i> (you need an explicit <i>Shape</i> interface/superclass).

If I were running an organisation like Facebook or Google, I'd be pretty concerned today about the privacy backlash that seems to be building in many countries as everyday non-geek users become more aware of how these companies operate and the potential risks associated with such liberal use of personal data.
