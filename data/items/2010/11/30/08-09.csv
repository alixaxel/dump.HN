Effectively commerce has stopped for the day.<p>Imagine if instead that audience of 2 million homes was interacting.  Think about hundreds of thousands of people watching Masterchef, and being able to stop when they see a recipe they like, bring up coles online, order the ingredients for the recipe and return to Masterchef.  Coles Online pays a referrer fee to Channel 10 and to the producer of Masterchef.<p>Think about TV holiday programs like Getaway showing destinations around the world.  The viewer stops the TV program, books a flight with Qantas, books some hotels and returns to watching Getway.  Referrers fees from Qantas and the hotels go to the Getaway producers and the TV station.<p>Every night miilions of people would not be passively watching but would be interacting in a vibrant online community.<p>This sort of stuff only becomes possible when <i>everyone in the country</i> has a predictable high speed broadband connection - the NBN offers this.  A hotchpotch of ADSL, fibre backhauls and wireless does not.<p>We should be garetful and thankful that we have a government with enough foresight to build such critical infrastructure.<p>If you are not the entrepreneur to take advantage of these incredible opportunities then someone else here might be.",1291107450

1953574,comment,1952037,1952651,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"My point is that in the time between now and when all governments and powerful organizations on Earth are open and honest (likely to be a fair stretch of time) organizations like wikileaks cannot help but discriminate in the organizations they shine a light onto. There are innumerable reasons why this is so, starting with the mere matter of random chance and limited capabilities, moving to the matter of the nature of the organization and the opportunity for such leaks to occur, to the interest of the ""viewership"", the consequences of getting caught, etc, etc, etc.<p>This discriminatory coverage has the potential to create a false portrait of reality. And that has consequences. Imagine two magazine covers, one photoshopped and immaculate the other completely ""honest"". To most uncritical observers the ""honest"" cover will appear vulgar and ugly in comparison. Only a few people will take the time to appreciate that the perfect cover is an utter lie. How do such dynamics play out in society, business, and geopolitical relations? In a wikileaks future a brutal dictatorship that can maintain utter control over its media image might be able to appear better than an honest and open, though flawed, country of liberty and consensual governance. Indeed, this is already a problem to some degree today. Idiots who don't know better imagine that life in dictatorial regimes might be exactly how the regime and its sycophants portray it (all the more believable without any dissenting voices), whereas every gritty aspect of life in western democracies and every flaw down to the least consequential is revealed in gory high-definition detail.<p>To me wikileaks specifically seems very much biased by the ""point spread"" problem, of judging America and the west by a much higher standard than the rest of the world. There's nothing wrong with holding America to a higher standard, but there's everything wrong with losing sight of the fact that the standards are different and then falling into the notion, as so many have, that, say, America is as bad as the Iranian regime, or that American troops are no better than the Taliban. The consequences of such discriminatory judgments and of such imbalanced worldviews are dire indeed.",1291107257

What is the crucial characteristic between those that makes some programming advice applicable to one but not the other).<p>The opposite of of DTSTTCPW is either doing things that don't work or things that do work but are more complex than necessary. There really isn't room to disagree with DTSTTCPW.<p>Thinking vs. coding is a false dichotomy. At the end of the day I don't care if Richard Hipp thinks for 8 hours and types for 10 minutes or if he types for the whole day without thinking first, as long as SQLite is a kick-ass software.<p>Personally I found that there's a (very small) limit to how much I can design up front (thinking phase) before I start implementing my ideas (coding phase). I invariably find that coding improves my understanding of the problem (often forcing me to update my designs) as well as giving me more ideas (it's not like my brain shuts off during coding - thinking is going on in parallel).<p>This is the core of agile argument: we're not smart enough to think about everything up front so the only realistic option is to start small and simple and build more complex things as we go and learn.<p>The author might be content with the fact he hasn't shipped his software in 9 years but I wouldn't take his opinions as relevant to what I aspire to do: writing useful software and shipping it.",1291106773

1953554,comment,1953150,1953150,0,0,davi,,,"On the face of it this is hard for me to understand.<p>Here's the way I can rationalize it: imagine Google spends $20 million (or whatever) to build underlying technology. Then spends $2 billion to roll out a nationwide sales force sufficient to saturate all cities of some threshold size, and another $1 billion for a nationwide marketing campaign to introduce the project to consumers, all over the course of 1 year.<p>On the surface this is a better deal. But does it remind you of anyone? Microsoft. This is what Microsoft does when they try to do something new. And all too often, they fail. One reason they fail is that it's hard to effectively mobilize thousands of people and spend gobs of money in a short amount of time. The effort is so big it threatens to crush itself under its own weight if it is not properly managed. And management is hard.<p>Google is essentially sidestepping this management risk by spending a ton of money. They get something that is in a working state, rather than trying to quickly deploy something huge and new. Money is (relatively) cheap to Google, but opportunities for low risk, significant growth into a complementary space are rare. So this makes sense for them.<p>Here endeth the half-baked disquisition.",1291106433

In this comment you acknowledge individual differences, and you take some conventional wisdom to task.  In the former comment you jump up on a soap box and proclaim what people with kids should do.<p>So first off, as a #1 employee in a startup that had a baby right during the early stage, I'm living proof of the fallacy of your judgement.  I pull off the work-life balance thing pretty well (stay-at-home mom helps a lot), and my effectiveness at work is not diminished.  The fact is that commitments at home give me an ongoing sense of urgency that keeps my overall productivity up without inducing burnout the way 18-hour days do.  And in any case, the variance between individuals is far greater than the variance between hours worked.  You'd be a fool to hire lesser talent just because they're willing to work 80 hours a week.<p>More to the point about this last comment, you're absolutely right to think about future regrets.  Having a family is a big sacrifice, and it will not necessarily make you happy.  On the other hand, slaving away at startups, even if you find financial success may not make you happy either.  Today's media culture (of which silicon valley porn is a significant part these days) programs our ego with all kinds of beliefs about happiness: if I'm rich I'll be happy, if I'm famous I'll be happy, if my talent is recognized I'll be happy, but the belief doesn't make them true.  The sad truth <i>may</i> be that <i>nothing</i> will make <i>you</i> happy, and you are destined to be miserable, or vice-versa.  It may be that the greatest accomplishments require a certain discontent, and in fact you care more about the accomplishment than the happiness.  It's a mess that you have to sort out for yourself.  Anyone preaching how others should live their life is invested in a particular belief system that may or may not apply to you.  When you are making these kinds of decisions I think deep soul searching is the only way to go.  I wouldn't place too much stock in other people's regrets, because there's no way you can sort out the baggage underlying someone's stated beliefs to really get a read on how it might apply to you.  Instead your only recourse is to go with your gut.  This is the ultimate gift and curse of living in a free society.",1291104245
