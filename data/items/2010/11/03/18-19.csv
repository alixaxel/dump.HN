1865987,comment,1863678,1865869,0,0,tptacek,,,"Where to begin...<p>1. Employment in the US is (for the most part) at-will. Employers can fire you for having a bad haircut. This is a good thing: it lowers the barriers to starting new companies and taking on new employees.<p>2. In virtually every situation in which people are given protections beyond ""at-will"", the harms have overwhelmed the benefits (see: teachers, auto workers, municipal employees).<p>3. The very few exceptions to this practice mostly involve unconscionable discrimination: specifically and literally, race, color, gender, national origin, and religion. To these 5 protected classes we should add ""pot smoker""?<p>4. To many employers, ""protected class"" is code for ""excuse to get sued"". Termination is already a minefield simply because of racial and gender politics. I'd argue that ending racial and gender discrimination makes the hazards worth it, but even as a legalization advocate I can't argue that ending pot discrimination is worth a dime to society.<p>5. It gets worse because in addition to the fact that every other state criminalized cannabis, huge companies operating out of those states (notable examples: the federal government, almost every major bank) have drug-free work policies that would overnight have become unlawful in CA.<p>6. California's ""lawful activity outside the workplace"" thing appears to be a CA quirk.<p>7. That quirk isn't settled in case law and may only apply to cases where companies try to suppress political speech or invade privacy.<p>8. It seems batshit crazy to me that I can, as a CA employer, fire someone for having a bad haircut, but I can't fire that person for being nationally televised for marching in support of Nazism. Let's not pretend <i>that</i> particular law was well-thought-out.<p>I can bring this discussion back to earth real quickly though. The problem is simply this: we're having a huge and tangled discussion involving discrimination, at-will employment, freedom of association, contract law, and so on. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people are <i>imprisoned</i> because of marijuana criminalization. Many of them are now going to remain imprisoned for a longer period of time because the advocates of this measure overreached and tried to pass a ""marijuana anti-discrimination act"" instead of a ""marijuana decriminalization act"".",1288810714

That might be a mailing list or it might be a shoutout on github asking for information.<p>I'm not too keen on a big structure off the bat when you don't know what the reason for the forking is. Then again with google groups it's really not that big of an issue to set one up.<p>And I'm fully aware that people have done this for the longest time without github but right now, github is where the ""community"" lives.

Their is also the issue of reach.  Facebook presents a platform that business can build on that people really use.  Facebook has users.

Sitting on top of Facebook essentially gives them all of this without a problem.  Most places can't do what Facebook is providing for them.<p>So now users have a reason to ""Place"" themselves at a business, and businesses have a reason to link into the system.

For example, the founder of the first (then unlawful under state law) dispensary -- and a kind of ""father of the moment"" was quite against Prop 19.  He and the author of the proposition had a falling out and parted ways in a joint business activity.<p>Various growers were against it.  They are <i>already</i> dealing with falling prices and the perception was that Prop 19 would greatly accelerate that.  That kind of political sentiment easily ""trickles down"" through the various supply chains.<p>Within the industry the main monied supporters look like folks who expected to make a cool quick few million in retail trade.<p>Those are the lines of a feud.  Hence, the regionalism of ""Are ya fer it?  Or again' it?"" [traditionally stereotyped as a question that comes from someone pointing a shotgun at you while asking].<p>A fair number of casual users were looking forward to their 5x5 personal plots and/or safe and (state-level) legal dealing --- but others were scared away by the ""no"" campaign's characterization of the implications of Prop 19.",1288807829

I see the same close-minded thinking coming from self-described liberals. Why can't we just talk about basic philosophy and not Team A vs. Team B? My original point was that conservatives should want legalization, or at least tolerate it, because they want to conserve limited government. It has nothing to do with republicans, democrats, libertarianism, etc. Conservatives were not favored in CA this election cycle. It's been the case since 1988. Liberals who want legalization can't simply blame conservatives for the banning of pot.
