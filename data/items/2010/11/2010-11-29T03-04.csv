1949312,comment,1949275,1949275,2,0,evanrmurphy,,,"Infix and unary operators are pretty straightforward, since they're just prefix versions of their JavaScript counterparts:<p><pre><code>  (&& x y)    => x && y
  (|| x y)    => x || y
  (+ x y)     => x + y
  (- x y)     => x - y
  (* x y)     => x * y
  (/ x y)     => x / y
  (% x y)     => x % y
  (+= x y)    => x += y
  (-= x y)    => x -= y
  (*= x y)    => x *= y
  (/= x y)    => x /= y
  (%= x y)    => x %= y
  (= x y)     => x = y
  (== x y)    => x == y
  (=== x y)   => x === y
  (!= x y)    => x != y
  (!== x y)   => x !== y  
  (! x)       => !x
  (++ x)      => ++x
  (-- x)      => --x
  (. x y)     => x.y
</code></pre>
While the dot operator's base form should be a prefixed s-expression like all the others, it may be awkward to use in practice:<p><pre><code>  (. (. ($ ""body"") (addClass ""hidden"")) (hide))
  
  => $(""body"").addClass(""hidden"").hide();
</code></pre>
Since the dot operator is so common in idiomatic JavaScript, I propose allowing it to be infixed as a special case:<p><pre><code>  ; expands to the above prefixed version

  ($ ""body"").(addClass ""hidden"").(hide)
</code></pre>
For blocks we use a wrapper function rather than the curly brace block so that lexical scoping for variables can be ensured:<p><pre><code>  (do (= x 5)   => (function() {
      (++ x))        var x;
                     x = 5;
                     return ++x;
                   }).call(this); 
               </code></pre>
The ternary operator:<p><pre><code>  (?: x y z)   => (x ? y : z)
</code></pre>
Perhaps we can create a useful distinction between the ternary operator and if-statements by giving if implicit do (just as cond has implicit progn in Common Lisp), but I'm not sure what the most elegant solution is. Thoughts?<p>Functions:<p><pre><code>  (function)              => (function() {});
  (function ())           => (function() {});
  (function ()            => function() {
    (+ 1 1))                   return 1 + 1;
                             };
  (= foo (function ()     => var foo;
           (+ 1 1)))         foo = function() {
                               return 1 + 1;
                             }
  </code></pre>
We could build a simple unhygienic macro system using the traditional quote ('), quasiquote (`), unquote (,) and unquote-splicing (,@) operators, as well as rest parameters (&). Here's how you might define a macro called unless:<p><pre><code>  ; macro definition

  (mac unless (x & args)
    `(if (! ,x) ,@args))

  ; example usage

  (unless true
    (alert ""Won't be executed""))

  ; expands to:

  (if (! true) 
    (alert ""Won't be executed""))

  => if (!true) {
       alert(""Won't be executed"");
     }
</code></pre>

The internet has democratised information to the point that an unhappy individual with mid level trust in an organisation can expose the organisation's ""sensitive"" information globally with very little effort and thought.<p>Before the internet an individual could expose this information, but the barriers were much higher. To be a whistle blower you could only influence people immediately near you socially. To reach higher you had to filter your information through news organisations. While there are cases of this happening, the information was still continually at risk of being censored. Would this cable information have been released if a whistle blower took it directly to the NYT, or even a collection of newspapers?<p>With our current online structure of Twitter, Blogs and peer file sharing it makes sensitive information immediately accessible to millions with no chance of it being censored. To me Wikileaks represents the start of something hugely disruptive to our way of life. It's not possible to scale an organisation beyond several people while maintaining complete trust in each of them. When every piece of information is at risk of being exposed, what position does this place governments in?
