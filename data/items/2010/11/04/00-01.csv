Sure it'll kill the infection, but it could well kill you too.<p>Go nuclear, it's the lesser of the evils. Existing infrastructure can be cannibalized for it (access to roadways, rail or river, cooling pools, cooling towers, etc.) even if the power plant itself cannot be. Furthermore, the totality of all nuclear accidents <i>in the world</i> has caused less deaths than coal soot alone. Disregard the fact that coal contains radioactive compounds that are being vaporised and inhaled.<p>Interestingly, I know here in Canada at least, that many of the nuclear plants have become their own sort of nature preserve.",1288832374

I screwed up HS to the point where no good university would accept me, and spent 18-20 doing web dev and not really growing.  I realized I had to get out of there.<p>My advice: go to whatever 4-year, brick and mortar university will accept you and WORK HARD to prove your HS transcript is not an accurate assessment of your abilities.  Live on campus.  Then transfer to the best school you can that's going to give you the most opportunities for growth.  I ended up at a big research university where you could get involved in research as an undergrad, and loved it.<p>Another thing: hang out with the right people.  I think people, to a certain extent, are just a product of their peer group.  If you're surrounded by smart, motivated people, it's going to rub off on you.<p>If you have a choice, I'd recommend not starting at a community college.  It's harder.

Nasdaq had just broken its own record, hitting 5,048, \n  and the majority of investors thought the dot-com phenomenon would last\n  forever. \n\n  Peter, however, privately disagreed, believing that the dot-com era was \n  going to crash spectacularly very soon. He already realized what the\n  market came to know shortly thereafter: There was very little substance to the\n  majority of dot-com “superstars.” Nonetheless, he capitalized on the\n  opportunity presented to him, raising $100 Million to fund these hard times\n  for PayPal, closing this large deal in only three weeks. The closing was\n  March 31, 2000. This was critical as the very next day, the Nasdaq began\n  its famous freefall, crumbling by 67% in less than 18 months!

Do you think you contributed $1M to your company's bottom line last year?<p>Remember that the goal of all for-profit companies is to generate profit, and that profit is either returned to its shareholders (known as dividends) or re-invested in the company with the hopes of raising the value of the company (and hence the share price). You can get a piece of that pie by taking your hard-earned money and investing in the company you work for. Some companies even let you do this at a reduced price (stock options) or, if you're lucky, include a stock award as part of your compensation. If you're not a shareholder, you shouldn't expect to see any part of the profit: you haven't taken on the risk of investing in the company.

I was 40 years old. I had a decade of hard work that took me very often away from my family, who mean a great deal to me. And I thought, ""If you're not wise —“ It, it’s important sometimes to stop at the height of things and to re-, re-stock. Go back to zero. Take yourself back to zero. Sometimes you have to do that yourself and constantly — to be able to rejuvenate and keep going, you have to sometimes start all over again. And I felt it was the time for that. I'd been very rewarded in the business, done a lot of films, had just directed my first film, had had a tremendous reaction.

The tactile feedback is significantly improved over any other keyboard I've used, save possibly for the Model M. Switching to the Omnikey from the membrane keyboards I had been using put a stop to the wrist pain I was experiencing daily at work and that alone has made the premium they've commanded more than worth it.<p>The biggest downside that I've found (well, that others around me have found) is that it makes a fair bit more noise than the average keyboard.",1288828941
