I don't mind paying more in taxes if I can delay the issuance of stock (in the RSU scenario), but I have a hard time paying taxes up front on something as volatile and illiquid as stock in a start up company.  Hopefully the RSU scenario will get tested and more accountants / lawyers will be more comfortable with this scenario.",1289228375

To put this in perspective a commonly known metric is that when Nokia paid 264M Euros for Symbian that, that value was the cost of two years worth of phone releases (dev. cost wise).<p>On this argument I suppose it depends if you automatically dislike ""big guv'munt"" and resent the funding, think it could be done different or for some reason think Symbian is a bad focus for this cash.

If you do a fold-left, then you'll accumulate such high relevance that you'll quickly start discarding every word in the right-hand data set. On the other hand, if you binary-split the folding process you're more likely to be OK.<p>I used a binary split and due to the sparseness of the data (and the uninsightfulness of my algorithm) didn't run into too many spurious drop cases. But the implementation I posted is very basic and shows my lack of background in NLP-related pursuits -- I'm lucky it did anything useful at all :)",1289228348

Caterwaul leverages this by implementing a JS parser, defining a macro syntax, and letting you determine how the code gets rewritten.

When it was PowerPC based, the performance/power ratio was actually quite good, thus the supercomputer built with them.  After the Intel switch, that really went away, and their hardware was no longer that much different from something you would buy from HP or Dell.<p>I'm betting this will go one of a few different ways:<p>- Apple will allow OS X Server on a small number of validated hardware platforms and/or virtualization environments.<p>- Apple will focus on HA clustering in it's software.  This is already available to some extent with certain portions of their software stack, but this is often dependent on coherent storage (Xsan) which isn't available without a large fibre channel outlay, which rules out the Mac Mini Server.<p>- I doubt Apple will get rid of OS X Server as some are suggesting.  It's implemented as a package that installs over OS X client, and is quite easy/efficient to install and admin.   At worst, they'd likely open source more of it and let people roll their own (currently many of OS X Server's individual components are available on <a href=""http://www.macosforge.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macosforge.org/</a> )",1289227813

I think you need to ask them. And the TW guys meant well. In fact, the teams really enjoyed the exercise. It just wasn't as helpful as it could be.<p>I think that this is not related to the questions per se as much as it was related to the focus on the Questions rather than the goals. In other words, people love checklists, and even a checklist of simple necessary questions can be abused. What I see over and over again  -- even from experienced practitioners -- is the focus on the checklist rather than the <i>problem</i>.  They'll get through an exercise with TW feeling great, having all the questions answered, even making some cute diagrams. But the whole project is fracked, and everybody knows it.  The team is just happy that they're doing what they were told to do, and had a good time doing it. That's not what I consider a successful result.<p>Taking dozens of teams through kickoff, I've found that the initial week or two is the most critical time for the entire project.  Many times I've had managers ask for a schedule or agenda for each piece of the kickoff -- couldn't I provide just a list of questions we'd be going over? Looks like this list might do that. I always refused, however, because once I started asking these questions, we'd almost immediately run into business organizational issues: the customer wasn't present, nobody could make a decision, conflicting demands that couldn't be met, etc. And it was <i>these problems</i> that ""Inception"" is really supposed to be fixing. Not just question-answering or game-playing.<p>Of course, that's in an environment where the problem is fixed by the business and the teams are supposed to solve it. In a startup, it's much more experimental-based and there is no set problem. Still, asking questions like this can be very useful. Just be careful to keep addressing risks, not just answering questions. That's the whole purpose of the questions, right? To find risks so you can get to work.",1289226201

1882496,comment,1881630,1882430,0,0,roel_v,,,"Thanks. My understanding is that it's hard to compare US secondary education to European-style because in the US there is very little (maybe even no?) differentiation between students and material taught, out of an 'equality' social norm. (from what I hear even people who are mentally not very well developed and would in Europe be send to a 'special' school are mixed together with all other students in the US). Did you feel this difference? I suppose that in the Atheneum you had mostly fair to good students around you, from middle- and upper class families (I'm not familiar with the school itself, just extrapolating from similar ones). That may have been different in a public school in a more urban environment. If you would have gone to a 'beroepsschool' downtown Antwerp, the contrast maybe wouldn't have been so big :)<p>I'm not sure yet if one system is better than the other though. Empirically, it seems that somehow US universities come out on top in the end after all, considering that the quality and amount of research products is higher in the US than in Europe (even when restricted to EU-12 to account for the historical disadvantage Eastern Europe had and compared on a per-capita basis).<p>I also have no reason to believe (haven't read any research) that the quality of life or psychological development is better or worse (for any objective measure thereof) for US vs European high school students. 10 years ago when Slashdot had several 3000+ post threads on Jon Katz' essays on bullying of geeks in US high schools (after the Columbine shootings), a popular complaint there was that the US system somehow exacerbated bullying because of this mixing of people that put the future convict in the same class room as the future professor. Reading those stories however didn't seem worse than what my high school (in Belgium) was like.<p>Sorry for derailing the thread :)",1289225392
