At some point the adaptation process leans towards these individuals favoring a form of acquiring anything at a cheaper (preferably) free price because the opposite side of the spectrum - that of being thrifty, pragmatic, conservative...loses it's efficiency over time regardless if many still view themselves as conservative buyers.<p>One may make the counter-argument that this is over-thinking an age old practice of software piracy but in my honest opinion there's a huge difference between underground software ""crack"" sharing from wholesale piracy to mass consumer p2p usage.<p>Nonetheless just to support your topic:<p>Justification: Piracy helps promote businesses via consumer awareness<p>Rebuttal: Piracy helps promote BIG businesses. If piracy supporting people were truly for helping businesses, they would be a lot more intelligent in seeding certain products.<p>Instead the most seeded ones are often times also those that are mainstream. This doesn't mean the technology hasn't allowed for those who would seed or allow for a less costlier promotion of an item but... until piracy develops a seeder mentality rather than a leeching one, this justification won't ever reach reality. (and by seeder mentality, I don't mean just those who have the capability to possess seedboxes or seed 1:1 - I mean we have to have a conscious identity as consumers even if we're acquiring something that is cash free because it's not votefree.

Then for each step, when we invert the outer-most corners of the square, we constrict C_2 such that the circle lies on the new outer-most points of S.<p>What happens is that as you repeat this process more and more the outer circle C_2 gets smaller and smaller, approaching the size of the original circle inside the square, C_1.<p>Also you can infer that the area of S is equal to the area of C_1 and C_2 since (area C_2) -> (area C_1) and (area C_1) <= (area S) <= (area C_2).

But that is absolutely crazy. You're getting maybe 15% of the VC's time and paying $8M for doing so. Seriously, that's nuts.<p>Instead, hire a decent investment banker and be prepared to pay several hundred thousand to do so, hire a couple great business development people who are actually in your space as opposed to in the venture capital space, and go to town. If your VC tells you that their halo effect is worth more than a million bucks, (or alternately if you're talking rather large numbers, if the delta between one money source and another is more than say 20%) you need some pretty concrete reasons as to why.<p>TLDR: Shop around for capital.

I was a little saddened that the replay and analyse option after games did not actually analyse games, but with the export I can download the games into my favourite chess engine and have it analyse the games for me.<p>[edit: noticed that there is a forum, don't go there. While someone occasionally posts an interesting game like <a href=""http://lichess.org/analyse/0mbole"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lichess.org/analyse/0mbole</a> the level of conversation is roughly what you'd expect from a 4chan /chess/ board.]",1290366123

Towards the middle of it.<p>---<p>Once someone has said “It’s (really) none of my business, but...” it’s entirely permissible (if slightly rude) to reply “You’re right, it is none of your business.” It’s also reasonable to reply “Well, then, don’t!” to someone who says “I don’t want to make you feel uncomfortable, but...”<p>---<p>That doesn't work as well for others, Imagine ""I am not racist but ... "" <interrupt> ""Oh, but you are racist"". So now you accused someone of being a racist. Sure you have stood up and called them on their racism, but you also created an enemy. Sometimes it is worth it, sometimes it isn't. Depending on the situation.<p>Or for example ""To be perfectly honest ... "" <interrupt> ""Oh but you are not honest"". Well now you are the one accusing them of dishonestly simply because they started the phrase with a stupid ""but-head"".<p>I think the point of the article is that some such phrases should raise red flags. They are not 100% proofs of lying or deceit.",1290366049
