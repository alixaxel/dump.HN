What they're doing is speculatively opening sockets to servers, and also opening a second socket if their first attempt doesn't get a response quickly enough. It's pretty easy to see how a bug in this stuff, or even just the expected behavior, could trigger abuse filters. But, as I said, I think it is worth doing.

1872176,comment,1871700,1871948,0,0,sp4rki,,,"You're looking at this completely the wrong way. For starters:<p><i>who is Google to dictate what other companies do with their own data</i><p>It's our data, not Facebooks, not Google's. Google is providing a benefit for Facebook and it's users and in return want's Facebook to provide the same. This is a good business decision for Google, a relatively very small nuisance for Facebook (since they do have a feature to export data), and a great BIG step in providing us, the USERS, with simple ways to use out data wherever/however we see fit. They are not dictating what other companies should do with their data, they're asking for the data stream to be importable/exportable by means of a two way sync in which the user is the one in control of their information.<p>Also, ""substantially fast"" and ""easy"", means ""in a non crippling way"". They don't want to get screwed over by Facebook adding what Google requests but maiming to a point it's not useful to anyone, in which case both the users and Google suffer from it.<p><i>How is this going to affect us - the small startups and independed developers</i><p>How is it going to affect you? Easy, after you leverage Google's API for years to get a gazillion users and a 25 billion dollar valuation, Google is going to expect you to play nice and share your data with them, but only if your users want to so anyway.<p>You know what sounds borderline evil to me? That you want to leverage the users data the resides in Google's servers and also take advantage of the API's Google make accessible, but don't want to have to go thru the trouble of giving them the same treatment. I find the company that doesn't comply with such a simple request more evil than the company that provides such a service and wants to build a relationship based on reciprocity, but is forced to close it's doors because someone doesn't want to play nice.",1288936318

I am curious which services out there have open APIs that one can use to create mashups (and just generally query).<p>I ran across an old HN article -- http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=216112 -- which is an interesting start, but being over 2 years old is a little dated.<p>I guess my question is simply -- what services out there allow location based queries to their data, what rates/limits do they put on them, and are there ways to getting greater access (for instance w/ Twitter -- the firehose vs. normal account query limits).<p>If there is already a good list, please share that.  If there are some hidden gems, I'd love to hear those too.",1288933732

Don't get me wrong, they are great to solve some problems, and even though they don't assure us to converge into a global minimum on our space, they are more robust than other methods to search in the whole space.<p>We can see a relation with the humans, I am pretty sure that we are not a global minimum in evolutionary terms, but... certainly we are at least close to be a local minimum.",1288933695

I've had my Google account since it was in Beta, and it's 48% filled.<p>Gmail has been so unbearably slow for me that it forced me to switch from Firefox to Chrome on a Mac. In Chrome, it's much better, but still very slow.<p>In fact, I just got Office 2011 and trying out Outlook.. I've used to be a devoted Outlook user before I switched to a Mac and went 100% Gmail for all my personal & professional mail. But Outlook 2011 for OS X seems awesome so far, so maybe this will be the end for my Gmail experience.",1288933611

Apple quickly quashed this, so perhaps these apps are looking to benefit from word of mouth, or to gain a number of reviews. As I mentioned earlier you need 5-6 reviews before you even get a rating and having more certainly doesn't hurt.<p>On a similar note, I believe Apple's charts may now be weighted to take price into account, at least in some form. I occasionally play around with app prices to see how sales/revenue/in-app purchases change, and last week I upped the price of one app from $1.99 to $2.99. Sales dropped from ~400 to ~250, but my chart placing was virtually unchanged (I think I dropped once place). I don't believe the ranking is based on sales over a period of days, though it may be a factor, since my ranking does increase/decrease with normal sales fluctuations.",1288933551
