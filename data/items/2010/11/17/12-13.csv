1914017,comment,1913102,1913102,0,0,scottdw2,,,"That's a pretty big conclusion to jump to (they are cheating the test) based on a small amount of evidence. If they were ""precompiling"" the java script for the test, and had functionality to ""preconpile"" java script code in the cache, would the fact that they precompiled the benchmark mean they were cheating? No. It wouldn't.<p>Keep in mind that there is a lot of code, such as Jquery, that is identical but distributed from many sources. It could benefit from similar matching and pre-compilation.<p>If dead code analysis (and other optimizations) was part of an ""offline"" compilation step (that's not efficient enough to do online), then changing the code would result in a slower execution path. Once the method body changes, the compiler wouldn't know it was dead without re-running the analysis (the changes could introduce side effects).<p>Now, this doesn't mean they are not cheating, because there is no evidence either way. But, what you are observing in this case doesn't imply cheating either.",1289998577

Recently re-launched / re-vamped, it's a mashup of Last.fm and YouTube (http://vyemusic.com) with some funky extra sauce to spice things up. The idea was to create something to take advantage of YouTube's awesome music catalogue, without just using the normal YouTube search API (which other YouTube music sites do for some reason) and present it all in a visually appealing way, which I think music fans and general internet users will appreciate.<p>By using the Last.fm music data (I hope) the experience is a bit cleaner, and there's some additional functionality with being able to upload your iTunes library (as an XML file) and move all your tune-age to the cloud. Of course the usual playlists / library thing is all there as well, and radio mode for the more adventurous audiophiles out there!<p>Anyway check it out, let me know what you think works/doesn't and if you have any ideas for how to improve the thing. Really appreciate any feedback, and maybe you'll find Vye Music an enjoyable music site (or maybe not, let me know why :D) --<p>Thankss",1289997437

I also don't wish to take a pro- or anti-environmentalist stance. I'm strictly neutral. I'm just talking about the nature of research publications.<p>Many of us in acadaemia are aware of a perceived phenomenon whereby ""fashionable"" (for want of a better word) topics get published and/or attract research. From a cynical (yet often accurate) perspective, researchers have become adept at framing their research proposals in the context of the topic <i>du jour</i>. I'm not saying the research is bad, just that funding is easier if you mention buzzwords.<p>My point is that acadaemia goes through cycles of particular interest in certain topics. The funding gets allocated to it and the journals are more likely to publish research relevant to the ""fashionable"" topic than other research. Now, I'm not saying the research is flawed; just that if you fund research into environmental change, you're probably going to find a lot of environmental change. If tomorrow you decide to massively fund research into extraterrestrial life, you will see a surge of papers in high-impact journals about that very subject. The environmental change hasn't gone away, it's just that fewer people are trying to publish data about it.<p>Perhaps for that reason we shouldn't be impressed by the sheer volume of research or the perceived quality of the publishing journals. We shouldn't panic because the number of papers on the subject has increased by several orders of magnitude in recent years. We should get a clear picture of what is going on, ignoring the funding bias, and once we have analysed the data from a balanced perspective and we see that it spells certain doom for all of us, <i>then</i> we can panic. ;)",1289996788

Parallel Computing is tough IMHO and it takes some brainstorming to solve even the basic problems like computing prime numbers or sparse matrix multiplication.\nAlso we use OpenCL, which itself is quite a complicated deal. ( TBB, OpenMP are simpler ).  The tutorial makes the basics clear as well as the post have an aesthetic feel to it.  All in all - a nice read.",1289996183
