Believe it or not, most people do not study copyright law for years in order to develop opinions about what activity should be infringing. Instead, they develop an ad-hoc set of intuitions about what sorts of activity copyright should regulate. Sometimes those norms happen to line up well with what copyright law actually says and sometimes they're in complete disagreement. In this case, the norms line up. In other cases, like a poor artist who earns basically zero dollars remixing, they don't.<p>In other words, what is legal often differs from what most people's intuitions about what is legal, and this difference is especially large in area of law that are complex and divorced from popular debate. The truth is that if you tried to explain copyright law to the average person, they simply wouldn't believe you because so much of it is so absurd.
