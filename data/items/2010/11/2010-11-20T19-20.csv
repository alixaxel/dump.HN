So it's not news that some want higher taxes and not relevant unless they can somehow prove they are in the majority of millionaires.<p>2.  The argument against letting the tax cuts expire is that it will bring down tax revenue by causing us to slip back into a recession and shrink the entirety of the economy.  These millionaires chose not to address or refute that point on their website.<p>3.  As thrill pointed out these people could easily lower the national debt without a law.  Simply buy treasury bonds and continue to invest that money and any profit made off that money into more treasury bonds.  By doing so you're effectively giving the government money that goes directly to lowering the debt (since the treasury will reap the gains of the interest paid on the bonds rather than having to pay that money to another entity)",1290283123

Engineers == self-centered == bad
Managers == other-centered == good<p>Another perspective might be that engineers are more interested in the value of the work they do whereas corporations are only concerned with the economic benefit they can obtain from that value.  I'm not an economist but I'm convinced that value and price/cost/profit are two very different things.  The first measures the actual benefit to a person or society of a given good while the later is determined by market dynamics/economic context.

1925047,comment,1924769,1925008,0,0,rprasad,,,"1.  Not entirely correct.  In most states, S Corporations pay more taxes on their income than do LLCs.  Also, you don't avoid paying the self-employment tax; you just pay it in a different way, as payroll and other taxes through the S Corporation.  In many states, taxes incidental to the employee relationship will end up exceeding the self-employment tax.  Moreover, wages paid through an S Corporation cannot be characterized as capital gain (15% rate vs. higher), whereas income earned from an LLC can be capital gain.
Also, the S Corporation has significant restrictions.  The most important is that only US citizens/legal residents can be investors. If any of the restrictions is not met, the S Corporation will be taxed as a C Corporation, resulting in double taxation of income.<p>2. I agree; the only benefit of a series LLC is avoiding the administrative costs of forming multiple LLCs.  Unfortunately, the accounting costs and hassles for a series LLC will more than swallow up the (relatively small) administrative savings.
Also, the series LLC is not a new form; it's just an extension of the sub-partnership concept and will be taxed the same way.  (If the corporate tax structure is selected, it each new LLC in the series will be treated as a subsidiary.)<p>If you're worried about filing taxes, just choose the simplest form.
