Although, objectively, we are probably simply living in amplified times - more people, more connections, more communication will lead to more progress than at any other time, but also to more situations like this.<p>I think the problem, as is often the case, comes down to incentives.  School officials have few incentives to make decisions on the side of reason, which may be difficult or unpopular, and many incentives to make ""popular"" decisions, which tend to err on the side of passion and prejudice.  Exploring why that is the case is a true rabbit hole...",1290131964

This thinking broadly underlies the idea that we are continuing to progress as a species and will ultimately learn to solve the problems that historically have beset us.<p>This sort of episode should serve to remind us that passion and prejudice are ever at-the-ready to spring up and override reason.<p>On the side of reason:<p>1. You have a classic work of literature that is <i>widely</i> recognized as an important indictment of totalitarian societies, something that young people in a free society should presumably regard as a staple of their learning.<p>2. You have a significant historical work that is a product of its times, which sound learning should suggest ought to be taken on its own terms, notwithstanding that society has changed since then in what it regards as acceptable cultural references. Again, even if regressive, one would think those raised in a free society would encourage its study, if nothing else than to understand why the older cultural references existed and why people accepted and later rejected them (if that is indeed what happened).<p>3. You have reasonable arguments that the references to ""savages,"" taken in context, were not intended to be demeaning at all but were essentially a literary device used to promote the themes of the work. Again, in a free society, one would think these would be topics that ought to be debated as part of coming to grips with a classic work.<p>On the side of passion and prejudice:<p>1. You have public school systems that are charged with developing strong young minds and yet willingly succumb to the premise that some forms of expression ought to be censored or circumscribed at the whims of pressure groups in the community.<p>2. You have serious subjects being resolved by supposedly responsible public officials at the level of pure emotion.<p>3. You have what amounts to open demagoguery holding sway over that which scholars would widely if not unanimously oppose.<p>The stunning thing here is how one-sided this all was, with cravenly officials scarcely even putting up resistance. The next thing you know, they will be banning books that use the word ""niggardly."" Based on the logic on display here, that is surely next in line.",1290131101
