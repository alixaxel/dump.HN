The more money a given application is responsible for, the more likely it is that it's a house-of-cards (pun intended for MVS nerds). They're always mishmashes of COBOL, SAS, DFSORT, and random proprietary languages that have never been the subject of a third-party book, and were sold to a company that was sold to a company that was sold to CA Technologies back in the 1970s. Whatever these languages can't do is implemented through Escher-painting constructions of Excel references and VBA macros.<p>So, when people say that R has some issues, I say, ""boo fucking hoo"".<p>Most businesses suffer from an unnatural separation between IT and the business end. If business people want something programmed, they call IT. They don't learn Python and do it themselves, because Python is a ""programming language"". R is the first real language that business people are being encouraged to learn, because it's an ""analysis environment"". You have no idea how often I have to edit the word ""programming"" out of my presentations for this reason.<p>R will win in business because it's decent, and it's been around long enough to not be scary to managers. I'd be cautious about drawing comparisons to other languages that have undergone big design changes, because, as far as I can tell, the existence of a decent language in the business world is entirely without precedent.<p>(Edit: In case the above came off as sounding like a ""non-hackers are idiots"" rant, it wasn't meant as such. Many of the people that produce these hideous monstrosities of SAS and VBA code have PhDs in statistics and atmospheric sciences.

I am offended when someone makes this association and usually on my friend's behalf because it makes her  job more difficult.<p>The logic is simple. I'm offended because someone else is causing harm to someone I care about. Granted, this is a specific example. I'm not really offended on the behalf of all massage therapists but I'm fairly sure my friend is.<p>If you worked with women who have emotional problems due to the way society devalues them it's perfectly reasonable to become offended on their behalf.
