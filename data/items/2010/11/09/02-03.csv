1885078,comment,1884312,1884312,0,0,davidst,,,"Where to begin?  I'll pick one of my favorite mistakes: Cleverly avoiding a market that was ripe for the taking.<p>In the early/mid 90s I built a compressor called Quantum that outperformed PKZip by an average of 20% to 30%.  For a few years it was the best-performing general-purpose compressor available.<p>Microsoft, Borland, Novell and a handful of other companies licensed it.  Cumulatively it saved them hundreds of millions of dollars in cost-of-goods for disks.<p>My smaller mistake was to not apply for a patent.  Quantum was the first compressor with a workable implementation of optimal parsing and about half of the improvement over PKZip was due to it.  I was then (and still am) philosophically opposed to software patents but purely from a business standpoint possessing a patent on optimal parsing would have made it difficult for competitors.  That said, I don't view the decision to not apply for a patent as being a mistake as much as a deliberate choice.<p>My bigger mistake was to ignore the retail market.  I felt that PKZip owned that and going up against them would be foolish.  Instead, I took the low-hanging fruit of selling to software publishers.  It was a handful of boutique sales (which one man could do) instead of attempting to penetrate the retail market against a strong, established competitor (which seemed intimidating.)<p>Except... I was completely wrong.  PKZip never made a concerted effort to build a usable Windows version of their product.  Phil Katz didn't like Windows and so PKWare was slow to evolve the product from a shell wrapped around the DOS tool into a first-class Windows app.<p>The world needed an easy-to-use compressor for Windows.  An improved UI and support for additional compression formats extended beyond the scope of my original product but I could have done it without difficulty and I rejected the idea for the wrong reasons.<p>The market was ripe for the taking yet I cleverly convinced myself it wasn't worth trying and settled for less.  Fortunately for WinZip they didn't make the same mistake and they quickly rose to a dominant position.",1289270804

The Buffett article he links to says because America's been doing no.3, the foreigners will use those bonds to buy property in the US before they're inflated away, and that the US won't likely confiscate foreign-owned property.<p>But neither author mentions what makes the US different to China, Japan, India, and others taking over US manufacturing. Chinese can become Americans, but Americans can't become Chinese. The US (and Australia and Brazil, etc) are founded on immigration. Foreigners buying US land can be given US citizenship as an alternative to having their property confiscated. The children of Chinese (and Koreans,etc) are going to Western countries to be educated, usually hoping to stay. By offshoring manufacturing and ICT, the US, Canada, etc simply get a larger citizenship base, not lose any global competitive advantage.<p>Despite the rise of China, many of the younger generation of Chinese still want to live in foreign English-speaking and European countries, and that's not likely to stop. And eventually, Americans will eventually vote for the government that lets them in the easiest, because house prices will start rising again when the international students rent them and immigrants buy them.<p>But Americans and Australians don't become Chinese or Vietnamese, nor do they want to. An immigrant-based nation such as the US can outsource its manufacturing to ethnic-based nations such as China and India, and stay rich BECAUSE it's an immigrant-based nation. People from ethnic-based nations will generally prefer to live in the US or Canada BECAUSE they're immigrant-based nations. So the US needn't worry about outsourcing to India.",1289269465

The density of their writing, combined with their tendency to redefine terms on the fly means that critiques often end up being critiques of interpretation, rather than critiques of the work itself.<p>Of course, the writers would argue that that's exactly the point.  The main idea of postmodernism is that the work is inseparable from the interpretation.",1289268086

Amazing experience, best money and return I ever spent on myself (includes all toys).  Do it and be wary of their tiered pricing model: everyone at the office I went to got magically upgraded for no additional fee--the surgeon was vested in just using the best tool 100% of the time.",1289268037

My security friend was talking about something that Amazon does not (and presumably very few people do) know.  Meanwhile my friend at Amazon was just stating the fact that he was not supposed to use AWS, or only with extreme caution.  Of course that may differ from department to department, if that's what you mean.",1289268035

Several services, for example the payments infrastructure, are subject to regulations that make it challenging to implement _at all_, much less in a shared environment like AWS.  Again, this is not an argument that AWS is compromised, and teams at Amazon are absolutely using AWS.",1289268034
