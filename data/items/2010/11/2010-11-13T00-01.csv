1899885,comment,1899089,1899089,0,0,yoak,,,"That looks like it could allow extending a practice common in only fairly new startups to more mature and larger organizations.  I like the idea of people being able to find things that they want to work on and that they think are important, build teams around themselves and take action.  Particularly at the beginning of projects, things work better that way if you've built the right team.  Later, you tend to get more pressure from external drivers and end up resorting to ""business owners"" prioritizing backlogs or whatever applies to your implicit or explicit SDLC or methods.<p>At first blush, this looks like a way to extend that useful aspects of new teams further by increasing the bandwidth for tracking, communicating priorities and dynamically organizing without losing things.  That's how it is different from bug trackers, etc., mentioned in the other comments.  It would be interesting to use something like this in a project as mature as 37signals and see what happens.<p>I will look into it further if it becomes a product.",1289609838

1899879,comment,1898600,1899137,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I'm about 270lb construction worker. I have never seen a design in my life. At 15 I got a job as a reviewer because I lived in the sticks I couldn't get anywhere to work to be able to pay for video games and movies - plus I was too overweight and lazy to be up to do a paper route. I did however use ingenuity and talent to start writing reviews, getting free games and movies and trading for what I wanted.<p>I worked as an electrician at 17 with a licensed electrician. We never did new construction so all our work was after-fact and involved a ton of creative work arounds (I was like 200+lbs, you think I'm crawling in loft space in the eave of a house? No fucking way - genius kicks in fast). I currently work doing siding, windows, soffit and eavestrough. Not only do you have to be able to make your own cappings, but our instructions are literally - ""[x] inch insulation, and [x] type siding"" for a full house with windows, vents, gas and hydro stacks, pipes, and all sorts to work around. Seen a badly sided house? It looks horrible, and worse you get leaks in your house.<p>I'm 22, in 5 years the only thing I'm unsure about doing in making a house is the foundation. I've done everything else or know I can without a doubt without ever doing it - roofing for example, cover your nails and stagger, I've worked with roofers and they literally aren't that smart. If you can't roof - find a god and pray for help.<p>In my free time I still write, on a nearly daily basis. Either blogging, or working on a novel or short stories. This writing is usually fed with beer, sometimes rum, always a sugary liquid like pepsi or coke on my non-alcohol nights. I'd feed my other work with booze if I could, but a drunk guy up a 32ft ladder is a <i>bad</i> idea.<p>I think creativity involves the ability to jump to tools you barely know and to still excel.",1289609680

We live in a world of huge bandwidth-delay products and short connections, the opposite of what was the case when Van Jacobsen proposed it almost 30 years ago (to be fair, it's pretty damn impressive that his basic idea has prevented congestion collapse from recurring despite decades' worth of network evolution). Google's position on window size definitely makes sense in that regard but the very existence of ""magic numbers"" would suggest that there's room for some fundamental improvement. I think there are some really great ideas in the RCP project [1], which basically uses some information provided by routers to allow all flows to achieve their maximum steady-state fair-share allocation within one RTT. Even if it doesn't see the light of day on the broader Internet, I think it has excellent potential for datacenter networks.<p>That's article you linked is a really great summary of this issue; thanks for sharing that with me.<p>[1] <a href=""http://yuba.stanford.edu/rcp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yuba.stanford.edu/rcp/</a>",1289608603

For a while, at least.<p>Whereas those who have worked under (or with) that person for a while might have a substantially different evaluation (more like -10x).  Either because they've deal with his morale-squashing abrasiveness... or because they've seen his handiwork up close.  Enough to detect, let's just say, a bit of a disconnect between their material output, and the superhuman gravitas projected onto them.<p>Also, while it may be arguably <i>more</i> true for tech that intrinsic employee values greater than other professions, there's not much basis for believing -- as many hackers seem to like to believe -- that this is something <i>uniquely</i>, or nearly uniquely true for tech people.<p>There are all kinds of professions (not even professions that have outlandishly high salaries) where it could easily be said that certain employees contribute <i>greatly</i> more than others -- bartenders, chefs, and (though some may laugh here) schoolteachers come immediately to mind.<p>Yet even though competition is sometimes quite fierce for these star performers[1], no one in those professions is in the habit of saying ""so-and-so is 10x, 100x more productive than your typical bartender/chef.""<p>So to a large extent, I think the whole 10x/100x thing has a lot to do with the current zeitgeist -- and the fact that a lot of tech people, frankly, have incredibly inflated egos, and easily imagine themselves in that rarefied 10x/100x category.<p>And not so much with the incredible, intrinsic business value of high-performing engineers.<p>I mean realy now:  10x?  Okay, <i>maybe</i>.  100x?  Come on.<p><pre><code>    [1] well, maybe not for schoolteachers, unfortunately.</code></pre>",1289607225
