1942826,comment,1942300,1942489,0,0,dctoedt,,,"> <i>Copyright infringement is not stealing. ... [it] happens when I don't follow your artificial scarcity rules.""</i><p>These artificial scarcity rules help make creativity <i>economically</i> possible.<p>Yes, copying is a good thing; it's how the human race makes progress.  But life is a movie, not a snapshot; even in the not-so-long run, it would be counterproductive to elevate copying to the status of an absolute, preemptive Good Thing.<p>Consider:<p>1. <i>Someone</i> has to invest money in creating intellectual property. At a minimum, the actual creators have to come up with enough money to buy food, shelter, etc., for themselves and perhaps their families while they're doing their creative thing.<p>(I won't even get into whether the creators' investment of their time is deserving of compensation; I happen to think it is, but that's not important here.)<p>2. The harsh reality is that investors normally will not make such investments unless they have at least a reasonable expectation of getting their money back (purely-altruistic motives being rare).<p>3. If prospective investors know that copiers will quickly destroy the ability to charge money for the fruits of the creative process, they're highly likely to give a thumbs-down to that particular request for their money.<p>(As an analogy, imagine the effect that Hugo Chavez's 'nationalization' -- read: confiscation -- of foreign oil companies' interests in Venezuela has had on the willingness of those and other companies to risk any more money there.)<p>4. So while copyright infringement may not seem like stealing, it can have a remarkably similar economic effect.<p>5. That's why intellectual property law tries to strike a reasonable balance between the interests of creators and their backers and the interests of the public. EXAMPLE: The U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress to give authors and inventors exclusive rights, but only for limited times. EXAMPLE: Copyright is limited by the fair-use doctrine.<p>6. There's often room for argument about whether any particular aspect of IP law is productive in supporting creativity. For example, it can be legitimately debated whether patents for business methods are a net positive or a net negative.<p>7. But a blanket statement, implying that egregious copyright infringement should never be punished as criminal behavior, is short-sighted.",1290793760

1942808,comment,1938651,1941559,0,0,archgoon,,,"So... we don't actually know where banning all unhealthy foods leads since no one has actually tried it? Apparently you are telling me this statement was meant to be a rhetorical fact-free statement, and I was not supposed to actually look at the real world because it isn't actually applicable because no one has ever done this in full.<p>I suppose that it is true that if the US was able to pass laws like a Totalitarian State (arbitrary laws with no support from anyone [including commercial interests]), than yes, it is Totalitarian, but that would have nothing to do with the food ban itself.<p>So, since that interpretation seemed to not be relevant, I assumed that if you were to actually look at a future where the US had banned foods, it would have had to gone through the standard process. You'd have the usual fake grass-roots movements, coupled with some legitimate ones, coupled with the standard conflicting commercial interests which would push for exceptions and loopholes, which over time gathered support and eventually would stop being a liability for a politician to support.<p>At which point, you would either have it accepted by the majority, like transfats bans in applicable locations, or it would be felt to be overly restrictive and be rebelled against, like prohibition in the 1920's (existence of spectrums are of course acknowledged). None of these situations make the resulting state totalitarian (unless you want to claim that the US was totalitarian under prohibition). Creepy that people are being manipulated? Sure, but that's doesn't make a state totalitarian.<p>So I looked at countries that had implemented _some_ amount of food bans (the 'real' reasons are irrelevant, politicians claim health, so if anything, is more representative of what we can expect to happen), to get an idea as to which way it would go in this case. It seemed like a reasonable way to answer the question 'Where does this road lead to?'<p>My apologies if there was some other, more obvious interpretation, but that was how I read the sentence.

I'm looking for someone for my team to fill a ""devops"" role, and sometimes people talk about it like it's ""developer/operations"" (someone who can be both a developer and do systems work) and sometimes it's ""developer operations"" (someone who is a toolsmith <i>just</i> for developers, does release engineering, deployment related work, monitoring and maintenance, doesn't deal with the nittygritty of production systems).<p>Personally, give me a developer who also knows operations and systems maintenance and debugging, or a operations guy who also groks development and the product development lifecycle.  Having these roles be distinctly separate people or teams, who don't have experience on the other side, is a gross inefficiency.<p>There's a tendency, as a company grows larger, to separate the concerns.  In a smaller company, it's almost necessary to have the same one or two people do both roles (especially in a startup -- your startup's chances of even getting out the gate are reduced if your technology arm <i>only</i> does one or the other).  I think some of the increased elitism from the purely developer side comes from the recent perception that ""you can get rid of your systems and ops guys because developers can now deploy to the cloud"".  Elitism exists in some form on the systems and operations side because technical debt is more obviously visible to them (but they are unaware of the history of the reason for much of the technical debt, not having been involved with the product side).  The ones who are legitimately  elite, because they are on both sides, are also seen as humble because they concentrate on actually solving problems using whichever tools are available from either camp.",1290793086
