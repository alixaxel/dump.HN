For even more fun, throw in Pakistan, North Korea or (really stretching here, because they don't do formal nation state like  diplomacy  or maintain records thereof) the Taliban or Al Quaeda.<p>I suspect a good portion of the people who decry WikiLeaks today would be analysing this data, or otherwise using it to draw insights to further US interests and lauding Assange as a hero, while the Chinese (or whoever) would be making the ""this endangers our people/troops""  and ""Wikileaks is irresponsible"" argument.<p>I doubt US citizens would be doubting Assange's ""agenda"" or saying things like ""many of the documents being leaked contain information that was exchanged under the assumption of privacy."" and so they shouldn't be public and so on. I suspect people would laud Assange as some kind of heroic figure for exposing an enemy regime at great personal risk.<p>Is Assange a US citizen? If not why should he care about the impact on the USA? Would an American care about the impact on say Chinese diplomacy before he exposed any records he had on their thinking?<p>Nothing wrong with being nationalistic/patriotic as long as you are aware of your biases (if any) therefrom. Most HNers are Americans and the discussion here is somewhat biased in that direction of whether this is good or bad  for the USA. That is just one possible perspective of many and hardly universal.

The rest of the stuff is mundane, uncontroversial, and honestly, should not have been leaked.<p>Governments desire and need privacy for a great many reasons, and IMHO unless this privacy is used to abuse governmental power or commit a gross injustice, the government ought to be entitled to it, just as we are entitled to our privacy unless a crime (legal or moral) is suspected.<p>Don't get me wrong, I think whistleblowing organizations are a fundamental part of a healthy democratic process, but this indiscriminate ""the US is not allowed to have secrets"" thing is unproductive, nor is it fighting any injustice or abuse of power.",1291013480

Google has a vested interest in things staying the same (again, with the exception of Chrome OS).<p>Maybe the coding challenges Google faces just don't have the sex appeal Facebook's have.

But it is equally important to remember that they are foreign systems.  I am yet to be presented with an example of a foreign system that would directly transport to the US and be equally successful.<p>The US has problems in healthcare, in education and possibly in its economic systems, but non of it is a result (at least in my opinion) of picking the wrong policy system.  Largely the policy systems countries choose are based on the demographic, values, economic values, etc.  Germany's economic systems work for Germany because they are build for Germany.<p>I recognize that this article is not directly making the argument that the US should convert to a German style trade and employment system, but it implied multiple times.

We're experiencing the second wave of the tech boom from the 1990's.  TC and YC are cheerleaders for what was already occurring.<p>* Recession/weak job market for programmers is a thing of the past, at least in Silicon Valley.<p>The job market is weak, in terms of quality jobs and pay.  Outside SV the job market for job seekers is absymal.  There are many skilled programmers who don't live in SV and can earn more money developing websites and web apps than they can in the job market.  Companies are being left with open jobs and unable to fill them because the talent is being eliminated from the job pool.<p>* Reducing this to $50/month has no meaningful impact on startup costs.<p>I was referring to the large-scale cloud computing, not replacing virtual dedicated hosts with VPS.  I don't have exact numbers but I'd gamble that it costs 2 orders of magnitude less money to develop a large-scale datacenter than it did a decade ago.",1291010929

If neither gdp growth (below other European countries in the same category as Germany) nor median income growth is a good metric, what do you suggest instead to measure German success ?<p>Your comment made me realize I may have not been very clear - the issue is that Germany's success is measured in terms of exportation as is, which is known to be a common fallacy in economics. If it were because German's products became better at a cheaper price, then it would have been a good thing, but I am arguing it has been mostly through artificial deflation (income stagnation instead of money deflation as this is impossible in the eurozone).<p>This is not very polemic, btw, and is pretty much agreed upon by quite a few people, independently of their political inclination (see e.g. <a href=""http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/martin-wolf-china-germany-commiting-world-to-deflation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/martin-wolf-china-ger...</a> for one reference)",1291010910
