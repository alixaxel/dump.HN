However, despite you saying it isn't an option, if you actually serve good translations through the site that are crawled, that may draw more visitors.<p>If it is a saas app and you want it to be used internationally though, I say go for it and use google translate to attempt to translate labels, etc. that you use. Provide a feedback area so that people can tell you if the translation is bad, if they feed like it. But be aware that there is much more to i18n and i10n than translation (legal, other gov't issues, cultural issues, timezone, character set issues in page and DB, layout differences).",1289588361

I guess I was relating to a hypothetical situation rather than the one I'm in now, but I don't think the choices here have anything to do with entrepreneurship; they're all circumstantial.<p>As all entrepreneurs know, things can fluctuate quickly; there are times when $50 today, little as it is, is more important than the potential of $5000 in the distant future, there are times when you need all the fumes you can get to keep things running. Then there are times when there is a lot of cushion available and $50 today is almost so worthless it's not worth considering -- in that case, of course it's better to take the gamble.<p>This test has very little to do with entrepreneurship.

First of all, recent versions of SASS include support for SCSS syntax, which means you can basically start with plain old CSS and learn to use variables, mixins, nesting, etc from there. Second, learning SASS syntax is not at all difficult. It's exactly like CSS, except without curly braces and semicolons, and it's whitespace sensitive. I find this results in much more readable code, and is much faster to write than standard CSS.

In this case,  the app was doing thousands of round trips for no good reason other than architectural purity.<p>In the real world,  composite operations should be done,  more or less,  in transactions.  For instance,  in one user authentication system I've worked on,  there are about ten database updates to create a new user.  There really ought to be one ""createUser"" call that creates the user.  You could probably get away with not having database transactions if you're talking to the database locally,  but in a distributed app on the wider internet,  you just can't expect to do ten communications in a row and have it work ""reliably enough"".",1289586638

Yes, it gets easier to handle rejection when you've ""been through it and lived"" before. But one factor that I haven't ever seen mentioned anywhere else: when you have so many concurrent ""rejection"" opportunities, you start to care less and less about the rejection itself, because it represents a smaller and smaller proportion of your open ""prospects"" (I hate to word it that way because it's incredibly objectifying, but can't think of any other way to put it). At a certain critical point, it almost becomes a relief to get rejected.<p>And I found that this ease with the situation helped me be more successful in general. People can tell when you're nervous. The more anxious you are about a situation, the more likely you are to fail at it. That's basically true for anything, not just chatting up girls. You worry too much about non-critical issues. So, when I wasn't worried about picking up a date, I could more easily pick up a date.<p>For me, that critical point came when I had three separate first-dates scheduled in the same week. By the rules of my challenge, I had to attempt to follow through on every introduction. I ""luckily"" hit a dry spell at that point, didn't pick up a 4th date, and quickly whittled it down to just 1 regular relationship in the few following weeks. By that point, I considered the challenge over and successful.<p>I think there is a lesson here for sales. I've worked at a lot of contract development companies that were forced to bend over backwards for their clients specifically because they failed to ""date around"" for new clients. When a client asks for a major, out-of-scope feature, telling them ""no"" is a lot easier when there are 5 more waiting to replace them. Now, threats from clients to drop vendors are often way overblown, but it's still important to not end up with all your eggs in one basket.",1289585845

You can find an informed comparison here: <a href=""http://devtionary.com/?p=89"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devtionary.com/?p=89</a><p>My initial preference was Less, because sass seemed framgmented with 2 syntaxes, and also less seemed more aesthetic, but I ended choosing Sass for the following reasons:<p>* Sass has Compass built over it <a href=""http://compass-style.org/docs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compass-style.org/docs/</a> and this alone is the biggeast win over Less<p>Compass is a framework that comes with a foundation of components :<p>- compass core <a href=""http://compass-style.org/docs/reference/compass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://compass-style.org/docs/reference/compass/</a><p>- many plugins for different needs (search github for compass), special mentioning Susy liquid grid framework <a href=""https://github.com/ericam/compass-susy-plugin"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ericam/compass-susy-plugin</a><p>- with Compass I can monitor a whole directory of templates at once, and have them instantly compiled when I save from the editor, not sure if Less can do this<p>* Aptanta Studio 3 and few other IDE's know to syntax highlight sass and scss, not sure about less<p>* If you don't like the indentation syntax you can use the curly Scss, Scss and Sass are interoperable, you can call one from the other and vice versa<p>* The ruby version of Less is deprecated and I write a ruby based project (indeed, not all HN users are pythonists)
Moreover, I don't like the idea on compiling the templates client side (as in less.js) and waste precios miliseconds, nor use an external interpreter (node.js)",1289585100

And it can be fun too, if you work on the right things. Even if I go on to be a farmer, I'll still solve the odd problem by programming the solution.

But unless you were present at the firing of your friend, or he recorded it, I don't think it's 100% fair to quote Jobs, especially out of context. Just because he can be an asshole at times, doesn't mean we get to slander and spread hearsay. Your friend wasn't doing what his boss wanted. The boss said something mean for whatever reason. Anyone in a long term relationship has said something mean. So if an employee isn't the right fit for the company, chances are, every once in a while, something mean will be uttered when they are canned. You're making to much out of it.

I've emailed a high up Apple executive about something before and not heard a thing only to get a reply to my email 9 months later while he was on a flight and had time to kill. From what I heard, dealing with all of the legal mess around the major labels (e.g., contract upon contract numbering dozens to get a single album onto iTMS) was a huge part of the 2003-2004 era work at Apple. It bogged down executives and even programmers who had to constantly revise code to accommodate legal requirements.<p>It could be that Steve Jobs was somehow being manipulative and singling out CD Baby. Or it could just have been that the company was bogged down. You said yourself that hundreds of others were at that original meeting. That's like herding cats. In fact, the entire iTunes Music Store was an exercise in herding thousands of cats. I still have a hard time believing it got done.<p>Regardless, it's still a good tale.
