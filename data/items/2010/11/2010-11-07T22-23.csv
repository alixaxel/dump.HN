Responses may be different now. Try to decide in advance what your goals are: are you hoping to make a scene or not?  Likely you should not do not do things like this if it is not acceptable to miss your plane.  I'd recommend choosing a final outfit that you would feel comfortable defending to a judge as not indecent to wear in a public place.<p>(I suppose I should mention: I personally have no problem with backscan X-ray so long as it is fast, safe, and effective.

They're cheap, quiet, and low-power. They're not high-performance, however, and not ideally suited to RAID applications. Also, given the new sector size you can get dreadful performance from them if you aren't careful in setting your partition boundaries.<p>Having suffered the consequences of ignoring data safety rules in the past, I now make a practice of having three copies of important data in at least two separate locations. I'm frankly astonished that there apparently wasn't a differential backup process at the company. I mean, a month's down time, WTF?

To work as a contractor has both benefits and downsides, which are typically the reverse of being full-time employed. My hourly (daily) rates are based on the fact that I might not be able to fill 40 hours of work week after week. So, in a sense, my clients also sort of pay me for the time I'm not working. That's why my rates are set to a certain level, and it's also the reason contractors are more expensive than full-time employees. If I happen to be working from home and I do work for 2 clients and both jobs take me 4 hours, than in that single day I earn twice as much.

For example, should these public discussion pages be over HTTPS on hacker news?<p>On my site I am planning the following: operate the login page over HTTPS and issue two cookies. One is HTTPS only and other other is for all pages. The public (non HTTPS) cookie is only used for identification (e.g. welcome messages and personalisation). However, all requests that change the database in any way are handled over HTTPS and we check to make sure the user has the secret HTTPS cookie as well. Often forms submit to a HTTPS backend and then redirects back to the public page over HTTP. Also, all account information pages (sensitive pages) will be over HTTPS.<p>This way, the worst that can happen via cookie sniffing is that someone can see pages as though they were someone else.

The Game Boy has character-mapped sprite, background, and foreground layers and audio functions with pulse, DPCM, and noise channels(it should also be noted that like the NES before it, sound functions are integrated onto a custom CPU; it has a substantially different instruction set that is a cross of 8080 and Z80 capabilities). They both have plenty of buttons, so there is at least a common functionality subset there.<p>The main advantage of the TI is that there's a large amount of memory/storage for an 8-bit processor(128kb, 48kb user data within the OS, 1.5MB flash).

Browser makers (including Mozilla/Firefox to a large degree) are responsible for the fact that HTTPS hasn't become the standard protocol as it should have been years ago. It's not only the unproductive mixed content warning but also the insistence of all browsers to only accept expensively bought certificates and throw a very scary and hard to overcome error dialog if a site uses any other kind of cert. While that isn't a problem for big(gish) commercial sites like GitHub, it presents an insurmountable hurdle for private sites and small-time projects for no good reason. For most sites I don't need ""secure"" origin verification as badly as encryption. The lack of a verifiable server address shouldn't mean that I should be bullied to not use an encrypted connection with it. But even if the verdict is that you absolutely can't have one without the other, browser makers should AT LEAST include trusted root certs of authorities who offer free SSL certificates, too.",1289169628

Yes, it's over 100 minutes, but I thought it was incredible; it was a gift to anyone open-minded enough to accept it, probably because the scope of the talk ultimately went far beyond video games. It's not that Jonathan didn't have insightful and explorational thoughts on game design, but near the end of the talk he showed how he was actually approaching deep questions on the relationship between art and entertainment- irrespective of the medium. I (as more of an ex-gamer than anything- years ago my parents made me sell my Super Nintendo when I starting acting like a junkie) still enjoyed the 90% of the talk that lead into the pretty damn awesome philosophical ending, but I for all I know an experienced gamer will call Jonathan Blow out as a pretentious n00b. Anyway, if any of you have read Infinite Jest, remember the conversations between Marathe and Steeply when you're listening to this talk. Are many gamers slaves who believe they are free? [everything that follows is from Infinite Jest]<p>Marathe had settled back on his bottom in the chair. 'Your U.S.A. word for fanatic, ""fanatic,"" do they teach you it comes from the Latin for ""temple""? It is meaning, literally, ""worshipper at the temple.""<p>'Oh Jesus now here we go again,' Steeply said.<p>'As, if you will give the permission, does this love you speak of, M. Tine's grand love. It means only the attachment. Tine is attached, fanatically. Our attachments are our temple, what we worship, no? What we give ourselves to, what we invest with faith.'<p>Steeply made motions of weary familiarity. 'Herrrrrre we go.'<p>Marathe ignored this. 'Are we not all of us fanatics? I say only what you of the U.S.A. only pretend you do not know. Attachments are of great seri ousness. Choose your attachments carefully. Choose your temple of fanaticism with great care. What you wish to sing of as tragic love is an attachment not carefully chosen. Die for one person? This is a craziness. Persons change, leave, die, become ill. They leave, lie, go mad, have sick ness, betray you, die. Your nation outlives you. A cause outlives you.'...<p>...[Steeply's speaking] 'What if sometimes there is no choice about what to love? What if the temple comes to Mohammed? What if you just love? without deciding? You just do: you see her and in that instant are lost to sober account-keeping and cannot choose but to love?'<p>Marathe's sniff held disdain. 'Then in such a case your temple is self and sentiment. Then in such an instance you are a fanatic of desire, a slave to your individual subjective narrow self's sentiments; a citizen of nothing. You become a citizen of nothing. You are by yourself and alone, kneeling to yourself.'<p>A silence ensued this.<p>Marathe shifted in his chair. 'In a case such as this you become the slave who believes he is free. The most pathetic of bondage. Not tragic. No songs. You believe you would die twice for another but in truth would die only for your alone self, its sentiment.'",1289169455

The problem is the impact that the unreality of the Internet has on people's psychology, and what happens when Internet psychology crashes into cold, hard reality.<p>There are two events being ""discussed"" here: the alleged incident of sexual battery at ApacheCon, and the Internet's reaction to the report of the incident. Both are, to my eyes, shot through with Internet-thinking.<p>I can give you a pie-eyed exegesis of how the rapid-fire 140-character ""we're all Interfriends"" no-harm no-foul if - it's - easy - to - and - nobody - catches - fire - it - must - be - ok mentality might have led to some idiot allegedly assaulting a peer at a conference, but you can probably see those arguments coming a mile away.<p>But this article isn't mostly about the actual incident; it's motivated more by how the Internet responded to the incident. And the Internet handled this incident the same way the Internet handles everything else: the same way it handles an iPhone bug. So you've got people talking about ""innocent until proven guilty full stop"" (note: you are not in the real world trustworthy until proven untrustworthy), and other people saying ""she wasn't actually injured so what's the big deal"" (note: of the places I would not want to be locked up for sexual battery, Georgia tops the list).<p>But they're not <i>really</i> talking about gender politics. They're nerds, trying to fit a complicated event into their mental models, which models <i>demand</i> consistency and transparency and rigidity. It's just difficult for the nerdal cortex to process the idea that rather than laying out an irrefutable case in front of a court of law, the victim of sexual aggression can use other tools available to them to retaliate, deter future offenders, and reestablish a zone of control over themselves.<p>You saw <i>exactly the same mentality</i> over the Reiser trial. ""How can you be convicted of murder on circumstantial evidence?!"" (answer: <i>very easily</i>). ""Juries just don't understand Aspergers!"" ""His best friend is a serial killer!"" The nerdal cortex tries to absorb these stimuli and turn it into a graph structure that can be traversed for answers, but no matter what the model is, at the end of the day, Reiser led the police to the body and confessed to the crime. Reality is inescapable, even when the graph isn't fully connected.<p>I wouldn't read this most recent story as an example of how geeks discriminate against women (though: they do), but I would look at it as another cautionary tale about how reliable the conventional wisdom of geekery is.",1289169227

So there's a one-way ratchet effect, where they keep adding new layers of security theater but never retire old ones. And because they're insulated from political accountability, there's nothing travelers can do to push back.<p>Public opinion is rarely coherent or rational. Most voters think Congress spends too much, but if you poll individual big-ticket spending items, almost all of them are popular.

Pape's ""Dying to Win"" an interesting refutation of your post.<p>> While the motivation of individual terrorists is quite diverse, and some do actually want foreign influence out of holy sites, the overwhelming force behind their hatred towards western culture is actually based on the conviction that they have to destroy a deeply amoral and infidel society.<p>An interesting assertion. You have perused their literature, as you've implied some for of quantization. Please do share your data.<p>> The 9/11 terror attacks were carried out mostly by religious lunatics from Saudi Arabia, a land that is both wealthy and not occupied by western forces. Of course subsequent American military action in Afghanistan and especially Iraq has catalyzed the recruitment of some new terrorists who may start out with the reasons you described. But even given the ongoing conflicts in the occupied countries, the majority of terrorists come from wealthier backgrounds and never suffered any occupation themselves.<p>You have entirely misunderstood me. It's not the occupation of nation states that motivate, but the occupation of Holy Lands. You'll note that Saudia Arabia contains the Holy City of Mecca and the Holy City of Medina. American bases once  near these cities caused a significant amount of religious and secular anger; strong American relations with Saudi Arabia still do.<p>> However, the prime motivation of the terrorist is not withdrawal of western influence anywhere.<p>Oh?<p>> Instead the goal is to achieve some kind of conversion by using fear as a weapon.<p>Hopelessly vague. You do know that these groups actually _state_ their intentions, both publicly and privately?<p>> The religious radicalization of the US in recent years together with our willingness to obliterate the freedom that once formed the very basis of our society, those are the intended effects and they were achieved on purpose.<p>How do you know this? How could anyone, further, have predicted this outcome?<p>> We are now closer than ever in spirit to the Islamic idea of society,<p>That's wrong-headed. Islamic societies were for centuries bastions of learning and art. Increased environmental hardship and the resulting poverty shifted Middle Eastern cultures to a more repressive frame of being, but this is hardly some intrinsic ""Islamic"" trait. Also, I seriously doubt that the goal of fundamentalist Muslims is to create fundamentalist Christians. Seems rather counter-productive, especially considering their rhetoric and historical views concerning The Crusades.<p>> we once again have disavowed science in favor of abject ignorance,<p>This phenomena is hardly new in human civilization. Note that Victorian Britains were enamored of the Marvels of Science and their disenchanted Edwardian children became mystics.<p>> we are taking back achievements of equality,<p>Oh?<p>> we are even working on instating Sharia law in some places.<p>Preposterous.<p>> We have indeed declared war on the concepts that Muslim radicals hated the most, not the least of which are: individual freedom and rights, self-fulfillment, women's rights, sex (for non-procreation purposes), education, free speech, and science.<p>Note that despite the rhetoric of al Queda, they have never attacked a country which did not operate a military base near territory they consider Holy. This assertion has no basis in fact.<p>> Keeping that in mind, the TSA's purpose is not to provide security, or even to provide a false sense of security. Its job is to update people's expectations about the nature of the society they are now living in. They chose to do this in a place where we're vulnerable, where our employment is on the line, where we invested a lot of money. They chose to do this in a place that once symbolized the freedom to travel anywhere we wanted without government interference. To show they own us, and to not-so-subtly demonstrate how completely our freedom depends on personal compliance and the ability to get along with overseers who possess the power to do pretty much anything to us on a whim.<p>Ah, ""They"".
