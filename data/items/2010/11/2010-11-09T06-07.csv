I think most people want to live in Tokyo if they come to Japan, but I think Kyoto is one of the best cities in the world. It's beautiful, has an amazing laid-back atmosphere, and is full of interesting events and things as it is the cultural capital of Japan.<p>The only problem is that you get a lot more out of Japan if you speak Japanese. Not many people here are very good at English. There's plenty of expats, though. Everyone I know who has visited Kyoto temporarily as a tourist or student has loved it and wanted to stay as long as possible.<p>There are English teaching jobs aplenty in Japan, but many have low pay and not so great conditions. As long as you're not from America, you can come on a working holiday. (I'm American so I came here with a job on the JET (Japan Exchange Teaching) Program. It pays a lot but usually places you in the country-side, not a sweet place like Kyoto.)<p>Personally, I think living abroad is one of the best, most educational things you can do for yourself. If I could run my own country, I'd require all citizens to live abroad for at least one year.<p>Good luck, and have fun on your adventure!",1289284475

I'm too scared to use it on any mission critical servers due to unpredictable downtime.<p>If you're under high traffic and you try to resize the server the operation time hugely blows out. There's no way to block this TCP traffic other than changing DNS settings which is obviously undesirable and you might as well just manually setup a new server if you're going to do this (which is what I now tend to do). This process should be automated. It's an obvious bottleneck and fixing would dramatically improve their offering.<p>I didn't really mind Rackspace having all these issues at the beginning, but after 2 years I see no progress anywhere. Unlike AWS there's very little apparent investment in the infrastructure tools. Other cloud services have matured, but Rackspace hasn't. While the support at Rackspace is awesome, there's only so often I can hear someone apologizing. I'd rather the issues just got fixed and all this friction was reduced.

I guess that's true, for some reason I've never noticed it before.<p>I usually keep my left hand on my ""home keys"" when browsing (Firefox user here), in order from pinky to thumb, q-w-e-f-⌘, of which I use w, f, and ⌘ on a regular basis, and I guess that usually keeps me from mis-hitting q when I mean w, I'd actually have to push the wrong finger, which is pretty rare.<p>Right thumb goes on the trackpad for mouse interactions (much easier now that the MBP trackpad presses in rather than having a button), other four fingers on that hand go on j-k-l-; (⌘+j/k/l I use all the time for downloads/search/address bar, ; is wasted, of course).  Scrolling is the only thing that sucks, but you can get pretty far with space/shift+space (hit space with left thumb, shift with right pinky).<p>If I had a problem with this, I'd probably go with the WoW shortcut for quitting, alt+command+Q, which is pretty hard to do accidentally (Double-thumb keypress? Expert move...) and doesn't tend to be bound to anything else.  Command+1 seems like a bad idea because some of us are very used to Command+(number) to switch to tabs.",1289283136

Then I realized that it's not an intelligence or skill thing; it's a cultural and communication thing.<p>- A friend of mine here once hired a guy to paint his ceiling.  The painter did a good job on the ceiling, but didn't put down tarps and got paint everywhere on the walls and floor.  My friend was understandably angry, but the painter couldn't understand what the problem was.  From the painter's point of view, my friend didn't specify that the floor and walls not get paint on them.<p>- I hired a crew to build an addition to our office.  After they put in the floor, I realized that it was lumpy and misshapen.  When I confronted them about it, they didn't consider it a problem.  I didn't say the floor needed to be flat.<p>- I asked a smart, college-educated colleague to fix one of our broken clocks.  She ended up just switching the clock with one of the working clocks.

Then it said it was going to take the server offline to do the actual clone of the disk from one to another. Then it took us to a screen saying 'Did everything complete properly? Yes/No', saying that clicking 'no' would just boot the old server back up again.<p>We waited for an hour, then two, then three, and the server still hadn't come back online. I didn't want to click 'no' in case it was something simple, so I called their support. After explaining what had happened to the guy, he told me to click 'Yes', which I did. Suddenly, the new server booted up and came back online. Support told me that when you get to that screen, you just hit 'Yes' and then your server boots up.<p>I couldn't help but think this was the dumbest thing I'd ever heard. They take your server offline, tell you it's going to be back 'any minute now', and when it is, you tell them if it worked properly or not. In reality, your server stays offline until you say 'Yeah, everything's working great', at which point they bring it back online.<p>I still recommend them to people who need basic services, such as 'I need a dedicated server for my blog'.
