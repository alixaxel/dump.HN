As a college student casting about for internships, that simple combination has helped me a lot. If you're interested, I could help set you up with the super-simple backend that can be hosted for free on App Engine.<p>I've also thought about adding a ""hacker résumé"" to supplement the regular one.

The number of slots depends on the number of applications we receive.<p>2. A group of 5 people will be deciding whether you will or will not be invited to present at SuperConf by Jan 1st.<p>3. If you are selected to present, you are responsible for your travel costs.<p>4. You present at SuperConf for a winner-takes-all Grand Prize of $17k in cash & prizes (currently working on making this number bigger).<p>Note: The winner is decided by a combination of the audience & the panelists listed on the site.<p>I hope I was able to clearly address all of your concerns.",1288757127

Facebook may look like it's poised to win in the short term, but the bigger and more complex the experience gets, the more AOL-circa-1996 it starts to become.<p>On-demand always tends to beat out kitchen-sink. The question is, who will eat Facebook's lunch eventually? Probably not a ""cooler"" competitor, as is popularly fantasized, but rather, a meta service of some sort -- not unlike how Google ate the content web's lunch back in the day.<p>Facebook Connect and the distributed Like platform will become increasingly important for Facebook as it hedges against site fatigue among its userbase. And if, at some point in the future, Facebook's core value is simply as the universal credentialing and friend list populating system for the consumer web and mobile space, that's still a fun place to be. But how monetizable or sexy of a place is that, really? Would Facebook basically be a Paypal competitor (of a sort) at that point? And how loyal will people feel to their Facebook credentials when and if they're sick of Facebook itself? Food for thought.<p>It's been said many times now, but ultimately, Facebook is Facebook's biggest competitor in the long run. And it's going to be a tough one.",1288756944
