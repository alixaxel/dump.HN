High barriers discourage competition and encourage monopolies.

1925029,comment,1924538,1924911,0,0,LabSlice,,,"I completely disagree. A person who is really passionate about IT security will know about cryptography because they are interested in how security works, not because it's a requirement for the job interview. In fact, I am surprised at the number of highly paid security 'professionals' who are little more than auditors with a pen and a form to tick.<p>Asking about crypto is a great way to weed out the auditors from the pros. There is also a difference between cryptographic algorithms and cryptographic implementations. I wouldn't expect you to write algorithms, but I definitely would like you to explain real-life implementations. A good set of crypto questions to ask, that are quite basic and yet will trip up lots of security pros:<p>* What's the difference between a Verisign certificate and a self-signed certificate?<p>* In which environment would I use the Verisign cert and in which one would I use a self-signed?<p>* In what cases would I expect the Verisign cert to generate warnings in my browser? What about the self-signed? How do I fix these errors?",1290279392

New sessions coming in get the newest version of the code, while older sessions keep running the old code, for an arbitrary (configurable) amount of time. This was a property of a system I was part of building in a previous job, and it worked very nicely; all session state was in a tiny (<64K) blob of data which contained in its header a pointer (intranet URL) to the server application metadata. In an ASP.NET environment, this made minor upgrades to the app server software painless, with no need to partition the web farm, bleed out old sessions and bring up new sessions, etc.; it's all automatic.",1290279050

1925008,comment,1924769,1924769,0,0,camz,,,"I'm a tax accountant and I can give you some insight into the tax aspect of the equation. <p>1. I don't think that an LLC is the correct legal entity you should be considering for your consulting arm because of self-employment tax. Many people forget that self employment tax is an expensive cost that could be avoided. You should be incorporating an S Corp to plan around the 15.3% tax. You're getting all the same benefits effectively except you'll pay less taxes. <p>2. I question the value of a series llc because it is a new tax entity and unproven in a number of courts. When selecting a legal entity, you don't want the new and sexy because you want security and predictability. <p>Having standard llcs would allow you to be sure of the legal ramifications because it is an entity that every state generally recognizes as opposed to the series llc. Also, a lot of the tax circumstances are going to be questionable because we can't be sure of their consequences. <p>If you're worried about filing taxes and the paper work then you could simply create a tax structure that avoids these additional returns. LLCs allow you to check the box and select passthrough tax treatment for partnerships or corporate taxes to be levied against the entity's income. Also, single member llcs are disregarded for tax purposes but retain their legal status so you could potentially avoid a number of returns. <p>I hope that this helps.   ",1290278822

For instance, you'll notice that if (Z,Z) is as infinite as Z, then the set of all rational numbers is ""as infinite"" as the set of all integers, since a rational number is just one integer divided by another. But what about the real numbers? Cantor showed with a cute diagonalization proof that they are ""more infinite"". Is anything more infinite than the reals? (Yes) Is there some level of infinity between the rationals and the reals? (I forget, but I think this is unanswerable, or rather, can be proved both ways) Those are some of the questions he worked on.<p><i>SPOILER</i>
The trick is to think of a big square, with 0,-1,1,-2,2,etc going along the top and 0,-1,1,-2,2,etc going down the left side. Then the ordering is done by infinitely zig-zagging your way down from the top left to the bottom right.",1290277933

No it's not. Unpaid overtime is perpetrated by the incentive structure at companies where it's in the culture. The same bosses that are so happily getting their peons to work overtime for free are the giving positive performance reviews to people willing to work long hours. There's an economic incentive to working longer hours, so people who are willing to work longer hours will flourish and people who aren't will languish or find a new job where the incentive structure is better aligned with their work habits.<p>If you don't like companies like that, don't work for them. They'll have no shortage of other employees to choose from: most engineers coming out of college have adjusted to the notion of long work hours.<p>(Frankly, there's nothing wrong with this: there's a lot to cover for an engineering degree, and making it easier would do a disservice to the students.)",1290276585

Which key is used for which function?</i><p>* <i>Cryptographically speaking, what is the main method of building a shared secret over a public medium?</i><p>* <i>What’s the difference between Diffie-Hellman and RSA?</i><p>* <i>What kind of attack is a standard Diffie-Hellman exchange vulnerable to?</i><p>* <i>What’s the difference between encoding, encryption, and hashing?</i><p>Here's my issue: if these are the questions you're asking, you're clearly never going to actually <i>work with</i> cryptography in your job. You may indeed end up deploying some appliance that uses ""standard Diffie Hellman"" somewhere, but you'll have no more control over that than you would over the LZW variant it uses to compress.<p>And that's fine! I think fewer people should deal with crypto, because people invariably get it wrong. But it's my suspicion that these questions are really just shibboleths; they're trivia meant to establish whether you're in the club or not.<p>In contrast:<p>* <i>Where do you get your security news from</i>: you will somehow have to keep abreast of security news (although, be honest, this is really just a question designed to bolster the club of security bloggers).<p>* <i>What’s the difference between HTTP and HTML?</i> Presumably if your candidate doesn't know how computers work, they won't do well at infosec.<p>* <i>How does HTTP handle state?</i> This is a fine question, although I don't understand why he calls cookies a ""non-native"" hack, since they're standardized as ""HTTP's State Tracking Mechanism"".<p>* <i>What exactly is Cross Site Scripting?</i> Sure, this is a great example of the kind of vulnerabilities corp infosec people routinely stumble across...<p>* <i>What’s the difference between stored and reflected XSS?</i> ... and if you've read anything about XSS, you know the OWASP-y taxonomy (although I might ask a corp infosec person to recite the OWASP top 10 instead)...<p>* <i>What are the common defenses against XSS?</i> ... and sure, you should know how to spot a bad fix to XSS, like trying to filter the <script> tag.<p>* <i>What kind of network do you have at home?</i> I have a Macbook. And an access point. I think the access point might be a 2wire? I guess I'm out the door.<p>* <i>What is Cross-Site Request Forgery?</i> As with XSS, a reasonable appsec thing for infosec generalists to know.<p>* <i>How does one defend against CSRF?</i> A little less reasonable but still germane (he appears to get this one wrong).<p>* <i>What port does ping work over?</i> This is the oldest trick question in the book (I think Cambridge Technology Partners made it up), but, sure, you're going to have to be able to firewall ICMP in your job.<p>* <i>How exactly does traceroute/tracert work at the protocol level?</i> One of my favorite interview question for developers is ""how would you speed up normal traceroute"" so I'm biased.<p>These are all reasonable questions, some I like better than others, that <i>all have something to do with the actual job of being in infosec</i>.",1290276099

Most students in the program tend to believe that technology development can be outsourced.<p>In fields like pharmaceutical or some research intensive ideas that require large amount of money even to start the project, its fair to say that presentation skills, networking and other softskills are far more importance to get started.<p>But there are people who think even software projects can be launched with a good idea and good business skills without any single idea about underlying technology or program. They simply say it can be outsourced once we get the funding and spend lots of time on preparing slides, researching the market and getting connections in the industry. More than 1 year is spent on these preparations.<p>For me it looked like enormous waste of time when lots of work(software projects) could have been done during that time.<p>When I read HN, I see many advices like 1. save the money for 6 month and start working on the coding 
2. stick with the job and work on the project on weekends.<p>But I'm not sure if I have the expertise or experience to judge an academic program designed by reputable universities.<p>Is there are two approaches?
One is, jump start the project right away and get the money later to grow
Second, do all the preliminary work first get the money and start the project<p>or the academic instituitons are misleading?",1290276097
