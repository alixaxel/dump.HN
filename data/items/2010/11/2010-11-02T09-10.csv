Neither Google nor other alleged gatekeepers can dick with our right to publish software. Even if we choose to give it away for free, users can download our apps and install on their Android phones without anybody knowing about it, getting a cut or messing with them. ""adb install MyApp.apk"" is a birth right on Android, bless the beautiful platform!<p>For a developer, Android is multitasking, garbage collected, and modern, almost to a fault. You can tweak it to your liking, as much as you want. And should you choose to, you can build it from sources and deploy it on your new exotic board that nobody has ever heard of.<p>At this point, Android is bigger than the efforts of all the carriers and handset creators, combined. What Android can do is only limited by your imagination, skill, and budget. Nothing is stopping you from developing a new mobile handset that puts the iPhone to shame (and many have done this) and loading Android with it.<p>Instead of finding fault in specific Android deployments or handsets, ask yourself: what do I want to do with Android?<p>This thing is bigger than a movement, it's a tsunami wave standing a mile tall: I want to ride it, I want <i>you</i> to ride it.

1859747,comment,1858905,1859166,0,0,_delirium,,,"Games is a particularly odd area because the big companies actively <i>don't</i> want designer/entrepreneurial type of people much. Everyone wants to be a game designer, but realistically, EA needs like a dozen top-level game designers, a few dozen designers of subsystems of games, and a whole hell of a lot of programmers, artists, and testers. They want to hire the next ""pumps out thousands of lines of animation code"", not the next Will Wright, because there isn't really any advancement path within the company to move up to be the next Will Wright, and if you hope there is, you're likely to be disappointed (or leave). Exceptions for a very few areas, which are usually direct hires by important people; e.g. Will Wright himself likes to hire a few, often junior, people to help him design and prototype his games. But a normal EA recruiter is not hiring for that kind of job.<p>I get the feeling that the situation isn't <i>as</i> skewed at many other tech companies; e.g. Google doesn't feel threatened by people with entrepreneurial / run-your-own-project kinds of instincts, and tries to channel them where possible. Also, when my brother got hired at nVidia, the recruiter actively was trying to sell him on the idea that nVidia was a great first company to have on his resume. Followed up with the usual we-hope-you'll-stay, etc., but didn't have any illusions about the fact that the kinds of people they want to hire often plan to move on or found startups, and that's fine.",1288691473

That would set a dangerous precedent though: ""I added one more feature to my demo! It's a significant change, so I can reapply!""<p>But that wouldn't be a huge deal since they only skim the late apps anyway.

If they had begun by gauging market reaction through using pre-order commitments (paid and unpaid) instead of relying heavily on deep pocket investors they would have been able to scale their initial offering to the market a bit better. If they had planned to launch a ""minimal viable product"" initially that could be scaled up over time as the business grew they would have avoided the massive up-front costs that sank them (the biggest cost was launches, they could have pre-built the entire fleet of satellites and kept most on the ground for a pittance in comparison).<p>Instead they put an entire fleet of satellites into orbit at tremendous cost and launched a service which on day 1 gave essentially 24/7 phone coverage over the entire Earth.

I hate that religious books aren't perfectly unambiguous.)<p>Based on this I think that we should judge the individual, not the religion.<p>However, based on statistics, it <i>has</i> been members of this religion that perform terrorist attacks, so profiling makes sense. I just don't think it needs to be done in the manner described in this story, <i>especially</i> for U.S. citizens.<p>In my ideal society, we wouldn't even have airline security for U.S. citizens, regardless of religion.
