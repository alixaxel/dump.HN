Hand-rolling an XML parser is a pretty sure sign of a certain kind of incompetence.  Wouldn't the same be true of hand-rolling a JSON parser, unless you're one of the (rare) first guys to solve the problem for your language or language platform?  To put it another way, wouldn't this only have been an advantage before XML libraries became commonplace?  The last time I reached for an XML library and found there was none <i>already installed</i> with my platform, I was using Tcl (and it wasn't hard to find TclXML.)",1289797601

FWIW, as far as I can foresee there will be no standard JS bytecode. Commenters here touch on good reasons:<p>* divergent, evolving VMs can't agree (not all NIH, see third bullet);<p>* IPR concerns;<p>* lowering from source over-constrains future implementation, optimization, and language evolution paths;<p>* view-source still matters (less, but still).<p>A binary encoding of JS ASTs, <i>maybe</i> (arithmetic coders can achieve good compression; see Ben Livshits' JSZap from MSR, and earlier work by Michael Franz and Christian Stork at UCI). But this too is just a gleam in my eye, not on TC39's radar.<p>Meanwhile, we are making JS a lot better as a target language, with things like ES5 strict mode, the ES-Harmony module system and lexical scope all the way up (no global object in scope; built on ES5 strict), and WebGL typed arrays (shipping in Firefox 4).<p>We have a Mozilla hacker, Alon Zakai, building an LLVM-based C++-to-JS compiler. Others are doing such things (along with good old SNES emulators and the like).<p>So being a good mid-to-high-level, memory-safe compiler target language is on TC39's radar. Not to the exclusion of other JS desiderata, and never in a way that compromises mass-market usability or buy-by-the-yard rapid-protoyping ""scriptability"". But one among several goals.",1289797537
