What will our food production look like in the future after we have damaged the quality of our soil in much of the current areas that we are farming? Our normal solution is to 'just add fertilizer' to it, but that comes with its own cost, and it also has to come from <i>somewhere.</i><p>Currently -- iirc -- most fertilizers come from livestock feces. My personal views on whether or not we should be 'farming living beings' notwithstanding... You have to <i>feed</i> those livestock something in order for them to produce feces. The current practice is to grow food for them (or to feed them the ground out remains of other livestock animals). So you need to grow more food in order grow more food? That doesn't seem sustainable.<p>This is not even getting to the issues we have with fertilizers running off into waterways and creating 'dead zones.'<p>2.

But here is how <i>I</i> would do it.<p>First as you proceed through the digits of a number, you know that after each digit you will have some remainder mod 7.  And each digit changes that remainder.  Now let's invent a piece of notation.  Let's say that (n...m) is a regular expression that matches any string of digits that carries you from a remainder of n to a remainder of m without in the middle having a remainder that is m or lower, or n or lower.<p>So, for instance, (3...1) would match strings like '6' or '23' or '200', but not '242' because after adding the digits '24' your remainder is 2, which is too low for the middle.<p>Now with this piece of notation, the desired regular expression is simply:<p><pre><code>  (0...0)+\n</code></pre>\nAnd (0...0) is not to hard to figure out.  It is<p><pre><code>  (\n    0 |\n    7 |\n   (0...1)(1...1)*(1...0) |\n   (0...2)(2...2)*(2...0) |\n   (0...3)(3...3)*(3...0) |\n   (0...4)(4...4)*(4...0) |\n   (0...5)(5...5)*(5...0) |\n   (0...6)(6...6)*(6...0)\n  )\n</code></pre>\nTaking just one of those pieces, what is (0...3)?  It is just<p><pre><code>  (\n     3 |\n     (0...4)(4...4)*(4...3) |\n     (0...5)(5...5)*(5...3) |\n     (0...6)(6...6)*(6...3)\n  )\n</code></pre>\nAnd so on.  If you expand all of the pieces out eventually you'll come up with a horrible regexp without my invented notation that will test for divisibility by 7.  (And nothing stops you from repeating that for divisibility by anything else.)",1288672731

Although merit goes a long way, academia is VERY political especially when it comes to making tenure decisions.</i><p>It's funny that you would say that, because it seems there are few environments better suited to people like Lukacs than academia. The way they see it: sure, the politics is a pain in the ass, but at least they're in an environment where they can make very substantial contributions to the world. The pain of politics is worth doing what they love.<p>Disclosure: my father is a very well known research professor in his field, who is always complaining about campus politics. ""So why are you still there?"" always gets the response, ""Where else could I go to do this?"" If you happen to know somewhere else, let us know.",1288671712

My biggest worry is that I do not know enough physics... I'm hoping P.chem rectifies that.<p>For the next academic year I'm taking the following: Biotechnology, Physical chemistry, Analytical chemistry, Instrumental analysis, Biochemistry, Drug design, Cancer bio, and doing some limited original research.<p>My favorite books in the past were ""Cell and Molecular Biology"" by Karp, ""Molecular Biology"" by Weaver, and ""Janeway's Immunobiology"", all of which enabled me to read the primary literature and contributed greatly to how I now see the world. There are also a bunch of poor or suboptimal ones that are not really worth worth pursuing. Once you read a few good texts, jumping right into a journal of interest is highly integrative!<p>Perhaps this is unwise of me, but I haven't yet made note of any of the people that are doing the reseach I'm most interested in. Even if I did, I probably won't be able to do work with them at this early stage.<p>In any case, my hope is that I can spend most of my time coding and searching through the chemical state space and biochemical pathways with computers. I strongly feel high-throughput techniques are indespensible and need to be utilized to make the best use of limited, prescious time. I would still enjoy spending some days in the lab running assays as they can also be quite fun.",1288671355

1859248,comment,1856068,1857968,0,0,gamble,,,"My first two startup jobs were in the Canadian health and education sectors, respectively. As government responsibilities, education and health care are covered by provincial freedom of information and privacy protection (FOIPP) laws. They go by different names in each province; Manitoba's is known as FIPPA.<p>In general, the laws are pretty strict about not releasing information. Student and health information is not supposed to be <i>available</i> to anyone except on a need-to-know basis, much less made available publicly. Our product had to have an elaborate system of permissions to prevent instructors from inappropriately viewing student data. Even something as apparently innocuous as posting a list of grades matched up against student names or IDs is forbidden.<p>The laws aren't for show, either. Everyone I interacted with in the course of that job, from bureaucrats down to individual instructors, took FOIPP very seriously. FOIPP compliance was a non-negotiable feature, and FOIPP violation bugs were always highest priority.<p>Typically, instructors become aware of student disabilities when they are asked to make special arrangements, such as arranging assistant note takers or special exams. Anyone who reveals that information is breaking educational <i>and</i> medical privacy, and would be in for a world of hurt.<p>I'm not aware if there are special exceptions for information released in the course of a lawsuit, but I'm not surprised that the university reacted severely. They take those laws seriously here.",1288670945

It does have extremely interesting problems though and does have smart people so you will learn a lot. However, facebook is most likely overvalued, so if you join facebook, it is highly unlikely you will get rich off of the stock.<p>Palantir:\nHas one of the most excellent engineering teams I have ever met. They have the best team I have seen in terms of algorithmic problem solving ability. They have an awesome company culture and great perks. Whereas facebook is the current hot place to work, I could see Palantir being the next hot place to work.<p>The one major downside of Palantir is that they work on enterprise software and thus, the product isn't as cool to the general consumer. Most of the people on this thread have no real idea what Palantir does and just assume that since they work for the government, their work isn't interesting.
