No matter how skilled they are - in fact, the more they practiced, the better.  I have trouble seeing this as as-quick as a semi-intelligent QWERTY pad that can correct most errors by proximity.<p>Sure, loops are fast, but are they as fast as a move and tap?  And how about ergonomics - is it more tiring, given that the distance travelled is <i>huge</i> compared to many others?<p>Totally-blind typing: awesome.  Huge advantage there where accuracy is important (Graffiti ain't bad, but small errors can magnify as you may cause a command gesture if you aren't watching).  I'd call it a definitive ""win"" there.  But how about other uses?",1288666773

People say silly things when they view age extension through the highly mythologized lens of ""mortality versus immortality"", rather than seeing it as a difficult set of scientific and engineering challenges, each of which merely extends your life expectancy.<p>For example, suppose that we had medical treatments to prevent cancer, almost all infectious diseases, and aging. Your life expectancy goes up, but sooner or later you're going to be hit by a bus or something -- not exactly eternal life. But still a darn sight better than having a mere 8 years as your life expectancy.",1288663849

This on-time delivery process is very different from how corporations manage their product releases and much more in tune with how volunteer driven communities are supposed to function.
