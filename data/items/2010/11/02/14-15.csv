I was relieved when Microsoft made this announcement (even if they are now trying to back track on it a bit).<p>Silverlight isn't bad at all, really. In some ways it's just fantastic. And given another 3 or 4 years or so, it will mature to the point of being a great framework. It's a truly awesome framework for WP7 and if MS can gain some traction behind WP7, having Silverlight in their corner is going to be a boon for them.<p>But right now Silverlight is both mighty raw and almost pointless for webapps. There are so many bugs in Silverlight itself and its related tools that it can make working in Silverlight quite frustrating. When all this time I watch HTML5 blossom and take off and pretty much gain feature parity (and beyond) to Silverlight, I can't help but think to myself as I look at my app, ""What's the point?""<p>Nothing is perfect, and of course HTML5 is going to have its warts, especially when dealing with every vendor's own implementation of JS and the new HTML5 components. But at least with this route you're swimming with the current and not against it. There's a lot to be said for that.",1288708721

They're not left at all, not on the economy (which I'm okay with), and not on moral issues (which I'm less okay with). So the greens are picking up voters that wanted a more progressive government, and whom voted Labor, and whom were then disappointed. The Greens picked up a seat in the Senate, are polling about 15% in Victoria for the State elections. So they're becoming influential at the expense of Labor.",1288707670

You cannot talk about a clear dichotomy between those who vote on their belief and those who vote on ""rational principles"".<p>It's wrong because voting is an inherent citizenship right; it cannot be made contiguous on intellectual (or any other, e.g. socio-economic class) aspects, e.g. knowledge of economics, full understanding of the issues etc. of a voter. If you open the door to voter discrimination by declaring some votes less equal than others, who knows what other ideologies may walk through it.<p>It is also dangerous because it creates a sense of ""right"". The one thing that always amazed me in my discussions with liberals in the US is that they argue that their position is, how to put it, ""inherently right"", i.e. that they are the informed ones, whereas the ""others"" are the <i>hoi polloi</i>, the uneducated, stupid masses. Years earlier, in the race between Kerry and Bush, when I pointed to these people that Kerry came across as unlovable and stiff, I was met with disbelief: It was Kerry's ""right"" to be elected because he was ""right"". The danger of this view, of course, is that it often leads to defeat. In any confrontation, knowing the enemy's full power is crucial and belittling them will not make you win the war.",1288707589

The reality however is that most of the voting public will not be, and your informed vote has no more weight than an uninformed one.<p>I don't like voting based on party, and I think the two-party system we have is inadequate, but the parties are there for a reason.  I know that I'm voting for a platform if I vote for a Democrat or Republican or Libertarian, and that the candidate is going to represent that platform at least to some extent.  In most cases, candidates' platforms are drawn directly from the party platforms, and you're not likely to find out much more about them until they've been in office for a while.  Even then, what is knowable about a candidate is mostly in aggregate.<p>As to actual issues, these can be much less straightforward, but often it comes down to something as simple as, ""do I want gambling at the mall?"" (a current issue in my district). There are a lot of implications behind this - money coming in from out of state to protect other gambling interests, developers who want to build, etc. - but I still think it's valid for someone to vote for or against it for their own personal reasons.

It's so heavily focused on Java/static type analysis, I'd think you'd be able to make a better/easier Ruby->Javascript translation by just starting anew.<p>The JRuby runtime itself uses reflection/some-day-invokedynamic to shoehorn a dynamic language into a static VM. Besides the fact the JRuby runtime would never get through GWT's no-reflection/nothing-fancy compiler, you're going from ruby dynamic semantics -> Java static semantics -> Javascript dynamic semantics.<p>Seems simpler to skip the static part. Some sort of Ruby's meta class semantics implemented via Javascript's prototype semantics.<p>I imagine the same thing applies with clojure, but I don't know as much about it.",1288706540

No attribution, link or otherwise for the assertion that ""Developers"" say they've been ""betrayed"". Who are they, how many of them are there, how much actual investment have they made and how do they expect to lose out? Not saying the story's necessarily wrong or untruthful, just that as presented so far it can't be considered anything more than gossip.",1288706515

I know none of your local issues, but I know that he's co-author of the McCain-Feingold Incumbency Protection Act, which gags those interested in the issues from educating the rest of the electorate. Apparently Sen. Feingold believes that it's better to have an ill-informed electorate, and that we <i>shouldn't</i> be able to use our 1st Amendment rights to put a voice to our ideas, if it has anything to do with politics.<p>IMHO, this is <i>precisely</i> what the 1st Amendment was designed to give us, and Feingold's disavowal of it overrides virtually anything else he may or may not have done.",1288706496
