1904127,comment,1903025,1903626,0,0,alexqgb,,,"The difference between these guys and many of their peers in the Forbes 400 is that they earned the money by building things. That makes them very different from a hedge fund manager who clears >$1b/yr. (a) from pure gambling with no benefit to the real economy and (b) by lobbying for - and getting - exemptions in the tax code that drop his income tax to 15%; less than that of the guy managing a McDonalds (or, as Rich points out, his secretary).<p>In other words, the systemic damage comes from corruption among those writing tax policy, which makes that policy a vector for spreading the resulting distortions and imbalances throughout the economy. The piece also notes that guys like L&S+Z are in a decreasing minority when it comes to a who's-who of the plutocracy. That is to say, they are the exception that proves the rule.<p>SV has always prided itself (quite rightly) on its distance from DC. But that distance can also mean being unaware of exactly how bad things have really become. Rich does a great job in pointing out that the problem of intense wealth concentration shouldn't be attributed to generalized bogeymen like ""technology"" or ""globalization"" or ""big corporations"". Rather, he charges that very specific and very abusive manipulations of tax law have allowed some of our least innovative, least competitive, and least valuable organizations to become maliciously self-serving at the expense of everyone else.",1289768337

1904114,comment,1903025,1903819,0,0,lotharbot,,,"I want to call your attention to a recent survey about wealth distribution [0] in which the average Bush voter stated that the ideal would be for the poorest quintile to have 7% of the wealth and the richest to have 35% of the wealth (Kerry voters said 12/30).  Now, a thought experiment: imagine every family had the <i>exact same income</i> and the <i>exact same rate of wealth accumulation</i>.  This is definitely more favorable to the poor and less favorable to the rich than you'd expect from the average Bush voter, or even the average Kerry voter.  The only way to be wealthier than someone else is to have been working for more years.  But if you do the math, you find that under this system, the richest quintile hold 36% of the wealth and the poorest hold 4% of the wealth.  In other words, this system that both Bush and Kerry voters would consider <i>extreme</i> in promoting equality actually provides <i>more wealth inequality</i> than either Bush or Kerry voters <i>emotionally</i> believed was appropriate.<p>Point being, the people surveyed clearly didn't have a principled reason for thinking 30-35% was an ""appropriate"" amount of wealth for the top quintile; they hadn't done the math.  In light of this, I want to ask you: do you have a <i>principled</i> argument as to how much wealth the top 1% or 5% or 20% <i>should</i> have?<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/id/2268872/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/id/2268872/</a>",1289768109

However, I also wrote for the student newspaper, competed on speech team, and went to the local high school's prom with my high school friends.<p>This, I think, kept me grounded. Yet when I went off to graduate school in pure mathematics, I was frozen. Whereas in my undergraduate years, I effortlessly comprehended the analysis and group theory flung at me, I learned in my first-year of graduate school that had been child's play. Study and work was now required. I failed again and again and it was painful (graduate students are not supposed to get B's).<p>Everything had come instantly to me in the past, so that almost no study was necessary. Things did not work this way in grad school, and I've been learning the work ethic for the past three years.<p>Yet my idiot brain still can't help but think ""Noam Elkies' discovery about supersingular elliptic curves got him a doctorate when he was 20!

If you somehow got funded and it wasn't YC-related, YC didn't hurt.<p>3) It's a self-selected group.  There are those that are NOT a good fit for YC, and they don't apply in the first place.<p>4) <i>Other</i>-selection.  Maybe YC only picks people who seem to have drunk all the kool-aid already.<p>5) Even if you felt screwed over, badmouthing YC would likely burn bridges.  So it would just compound your problems.<p>6) Would a dissenting opinion be trumpeted or quashed by the editors here?  Not being aware of any examples doesn't mean they aren't out there.<p>7) People don't want to do postmortems on their failures in general, and blaming others is generally seen as bad form, even if they really ARE to blame.<p>8) Brainwashing.  Even people who join street gangs would almost never blame them for messing up the member's life.  It becomes an in-group identity.  YC ain't no street gang, and the social ties alone can be a huge thing for people who otherwise feel quite isolated, even if YC per se isn't their cup of tea.<p>9) There are so many difficulties that a million other things are more likely to screw up a startup than anything YC does.<p>10) Since focus is key, if YC gets you to focus obsessively for 3 months, that alone probably outweighs any negatives that may pop up.  If your personal trainer or drill sergeant whips you into shape, then you got in shape, even if you think the process wasn't 100% optimal.  The real tiger beats the paper one.<p>A big part of it is just psychologically ""giving yourself permission"" to make something THE priority.  If you are doing a formal program, WITH A TIME LIMIT, friends and family understand that in a way they don't understand you just doing it by yourself, and won't bother you with distractions.  And due to social conditioning, you have a LOT of psychological tweaks making YOU prioritize your own project over surfing and wasting time.<p>Note every term how few comments there are on this site from people doing the program.

I wanted the ability to reuse content through snippets and even the possibility of creating my own macros easily, so I ended up creating a new language.<p>How heavily you use glyph is entirely up to you. If you like Textile and Markdown, you can just use some of the core macros and sections. For example:<p><pre><code>  md_section[\n    @title[Test Section #1]\n  This is basically a titled div where you can use _markdown_.\n  ] \n  txt_section[\n    @title[Test Section #2]\n  Here, instead, you can use *Textile*.\n  ]\n\n</code></pre>\nIn this way yes, Markdown and Textile are second-class citizens, but this is a good thing, in a way. Glyph is markup-independent so you can use them both, if you like, and even create additional filters if you want.<p>Regarding the syntax, I wanted something very basic (and easy to parse :P) but usable. Sometimes it may get a bit heavy, but on the other hand you can create macros for complex formatting, i.e. custom tables.<p>At any rate, if you have any ideas on how to improve Glyph PLEASE do contact me! I'm always looking for constructive feedback!",1289764862

Odd displays can indicate the existence of information that a presenter intentionally wishes to avoid highlighting, or information that the presenter simply does not recognize is present, and that information can be as interesting as what a presenter does choose to highlight.<p>Based on the Slate data referenced elsewhere in the comments here, there looks to be around 84% of the aggregate income for the top 20% of the earners.<p>Then interpolating the data buckets shown within the NTU tables and particularly guessing that the 20% range is around 80% of the taxes paid, and matching that with the Slate income charts.<p>This implies that the folks with 80% of the income pay somewhere roughly around 80% of the taxes.  Give or take.<p>I'd be interested in seeing a NTU-like breakdown matched with what data Slate has shown for relative incomes; matched with what looks to be the income and with slicing the income based on the different AGIs.",1289764815
