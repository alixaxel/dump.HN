(I know a lot of people who are in their 30's,  40's and 50's who've successfully learned new skills)<p>Communications of the ACM has hand-wringing articles in every issue about ""Why don't students want to study CS?""  They never mention the elephant in the room -- that these students are hearing from computer professionals in their 30's and 40's who all of a sudden find they are working a dead end job.<p>There's a huge demand for inexperienced out-of-college engineers that will work for cheap (for instance,  equity that probably won't materialize),  not demand health insurance,  and work 80 hours a week on ""charge of the light brigade"" projects that lack any semblance of project management.  There's very little demand for experienced engineers who realize that management is full of <i></i>it.<p>There's no educational institution that produces people with the skills it takes to develop today's web sites.  Often CS graduates get a bunch of 20-year old pap about algorithms and never learn a thing about project management, modern distributed systems,  and all the little details from CSS to the management of social systems.  People get those skills working in the school of hard knocks,  and a lot of those people (like myself) have been doing it for 15 years and we're not going to take crap from anybody.<p>When it comes to inequality,  it's dawning on people that higher ed is part of the problem,  not part of the solution. The few remaining ""good"" and ""secure"" jobs in this country are open to people who graduate (as undergraduates) from Harvard and Yale.  The entrance of women into the workforce has doubled the opportunity of employers to play out their racist and classist impulses.",1289757532

And the irony of the current situation is that the ""fragmentation"" we're seeing now is likely responsible for the fact that web development is ""easier by the day.""<p>The worst situation, which we had back in the late 90s, was increasing domination by one player intent on subverting standards to push its own platform.  Then innovative platforms get pushed aside for expediency's sake.  Wrenching the web back from Microsoft resulted in many years of difficulty, but now we're in a situation where everyone, even Microsoft, must adhere to standards or be left behind.  The very best outcome for web users will be for the market to stay as ""fragmented"" as possible, so everyone will be forced to stick with standards, and nobody ever gains a large share that can be used as a lever to distort the market.",1289757489

Nothing says the United States, Canada, Germany, France, Australia, Japan, China, India, or any other nation on the planet must make it easy for an immigrant to enter and establish a business.  Least of which, establish a business that requires minimal presence and that can direct its expenditures to any other country.  Put another way, if you were the Minister of Immigration, would you prefer to have the cloud-based start-up with 4 employees, two of whom want to live in your country, or do you want the datacenter that has millions of $currency_units worth of equipment that can't easily be forklifted out of the country?<p>To address your second point, without making any pass at politics: Someone once said that states are laboratories of democracies; therefore, each state conducts its internal affairs differently.

In computer science, at least, I know many people who spend 4-8 months doing research and getting results, and then 1 week writing. This is incredibly foolish, because you're selling yourself short. It takes a lot of time and energy to write (and rewrite) well, and unless you're a top-notch writer, 1 week is not going to be enough.<p>It's just a matter of setting priorities -- writing should not be an afterthought. You may have done the best research in the world, but if no one can understand it easily from the paper, it won't matter. I try to spend a month writing and editing my papers (often going through 15-20 drafts) to make them as good as possible. It seems like a lot of time, until you realize that if your paper is not well-written, it's not going to be read and understood, and so you've lost 8 months of work, not 1 month.<p>The same thing applies to preparing presentations for academic conferences. Most talks are terrible, and so it's actually not that hard to make one that stands out. The main thing to remember in talks is that it's just an advertisement to get people to read your paper; it's not a substitute! From this, you can derive many of the rules for giving good talks: provide strong motivation and background, skip very technical stuff, have a polished presentation, keep it simple, don't be boring, etc.",1289755205

It is also skewed towards topics that are not 'hard science', for example much of this doesn't apply to proofs, since they're (mostly) either correct or wrong.)<p>First, you need to define 'great quality'. Will you measure 'quality' by (1) what the reader will get out of it, or (2) what you (the writer) get(s) out of it?<p>For most academics, the second one is most relevant in the end. But the traditional view is that by fulfilling (1), (2) will automatically follow. You need to examine this hypothesis early in your academic career and see if it holds true in your field or publishing environment. Will you get name, fame and tenure by writing easy to read papers? Early-career, idealistic academics usually assume so, but finding out sooner rather than later (preferably without having to test empirically) if this is true can save you a lot of time.<p>In my opinion, for us mere mortals there are two ways to write a paper that has great influence and is widely cited. (the third way is to write a great, groundbreaking, genius-quality paper - let's face it, most of us are never going to do that.)<p>- Write one that is easy to understand and has broad scope. The topic needs to be 'fundamental' in the sense that it needs to be a precursor or prerequisite for research topics that are in itself (usually) much sexier. This way, your paper will be a good 'filler' citation, i.e. many people will cite your paper in the introduction of their papers because it was easy to understand (they didn't have to spend too much time reading and understanding it) and because the topic is obviously relevant to the rest of their paper. Furthermore, it helps if your paper can be used to support a position that people usually glossed over ('proof by hand waving'). In this way your paper can easily be added as a citation to a paper the night before the submission deadline. (what I mean is, it helps if your paper is not a fundamental part on which other papers can be build, but rather a piece of supporting evidence that makes the citing paper seem well-researched).<p>- The second way is to write a paper that looks more profound and seems to solve a difficult problem than it actually does, and then market it heavily so that others get convinced of these qualities by other means like social proof, the eloquence of its defenders, the ubiquitousness of the topic showing up at conferences etc. Now you won't (usually) get away with complete nonsense topics or contents so you'll still need to have somewhat good content, but writing in this category tends to use lots of obscure jargon, passive voice, long sentences etc. The writing style needs to be almost the opposite of the previous type of paper. For this to work out you need good networking and people skills and time and means to go out there and promote your paper. Both of these don't come naturally to many PhD students or fresh PhD's.<p>(Personally I tend to write, and even post online, in long sentences, use lots of expensive sounding words, phrase things in generalities where concrete terms would've clarified the content and not taken anything away from the point, etc - mostly out of habit. Make of that what you will about the content I usually try to get across ;) )",1289755101

My mother designs curriculum for gifted education, and over the years I've seen that part of the difficulty in raising a gifted child to being a healthy, successful adult is knowing what to do with them.<p>Richard Feynman was building complex electronic booby traps in his room when he was seven. Before turning ten he had nearly burned down his house with a homemade transformer in his ad hoc laboratory. Most parents would see him as a problem that needed to be fixed, or be so confused that he'd end up being ignored. Many parents can't see the world from the perspective of a gifted child, realizing how slow school seems, how frustrating their peers might be. Many parents wouldn't consider sending their kid to math camp, or Robot One, or having them apprentice for an electronics engineer. Since the adults wouldn't consider it fun, it doesn't occur to them, unless they're very close with their child, that their kid might love a month doing advanced math, or learning physics early.<p>I believe that gifted kids are fragile. They need strong reinforcement at home telling them to do what makes them happy, whether the other kids dream of being scientists, or a cellists, or a astrophysicists, or not. Since smart kids are also very aware of themselves, they're also very sensitive to the expectations of their parents and teachers. A lifetime of being told how exceptional you are can lead to severe depression if you wind up simply average. Someone with those kind of expectations lumped on them can even become very successful and still spend the remainder of their life lamenting the potential they had, judging themselves for not becoming a first chair, first rate, phd everything.",1289754860

Also, a huge simplification is that we ignore the impact on the economy; one of the central arguments for keeping the tax cuts is that it supposedly creates more jobs, as does government workers and aid to states.<p>Very cool find, though. Maybe it should be a required exercise before each election season, just to discourage politicians from focusing on the less important topics.<p>One last eye-opener:  this only helps plug up the year-to-year budget deficit.  The actual national debt is $13.5 trillion, and should another recession hit us between now and 2030, we'll be in bigger trouble even if you managed to balance the budget in this ""simulation.""",1289754203

And further, even if you are using SSL, if you aren't checking the key sigs, they can again see everything.<p>Cookies are simple and elegant and are not the problem - the solutions have existed for almost 20 years.<p>Firesheep is great because it is not only switching on users who had no clue, but also developers who have no clue.",1289754111
