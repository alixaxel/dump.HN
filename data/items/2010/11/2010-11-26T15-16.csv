I am not certain that this is in fact the case.

1942538,comment,1942300,1942489,0,0,jules,,,"So what is the difference between stealing and copyright infringement? That the scarcity in the latter case comes from artificial rules? If you have a piece of land with oil in the ground then what makes that oil scarce is the government artificially protecting your property rights, just like copyrighted content is scarce because of the government's protection of copy rights. Your ability to sell the oil depends on the artificial rules set by the government (or on your private army), just like your ability to sell a book depends on artificial rules set by the government (or on a private army).<p>The argument that if somebody takes the oil out of your ground you don't have the oil anymore is not important in a discussion of whether it's ethical to do so, because the effects are the same for copyright infringement. If you write a book and I put a copy of it online, then the net effect is that you can't sell your book effectively anymore. Just like the case where I take the oil that's easy to get out of the ground and you can't sell your oil effectively anymore.<p>So saying that copyright infringement is not stealing, while perhaps law technically true, is a dishonest presentation of the issue.

Solve this specific geometry problem. Where does this specific function attain a maximum?<p>- Abstraction to spaces (undergrad): The focus changes to abstract spaces and structures (e.g. topological spaces, groups, function spaces). E.g. Instead of focusing on the properties of one function, we study properties of a function space. A theorem proven about groups in general applies to any example of a group.<p>- Categorical abstraction (grad school): We can abstract further from specific structures to categories. Many structure-specific constructions (e.g. direct sums of groups, disjoint unions of sets, wedge products of pointed space) can be unified into categorical constructions (e.g. the co-product for those just listed). The language of functors provides a uniform way of talking about mapping one type of structure into another.<p>Another unrelated major viewpoint change I've experienced is that I've resigned myself to the fact that the world is much more random and uncontrollable than we believe it is. Pretty much all major events in my life have been unpredictable and essentially due to chance. This realization has provided me with more peace of mind, than before when I was much more worried about ""making the right decisions"".<p>I am interested in what meta-viewpoints people have experienced, and any changes they've experienced.
