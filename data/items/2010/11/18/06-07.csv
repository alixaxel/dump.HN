Eventually we abandoned it.<p>2nd project) I had a cool idea for something highly technical that I sort of wanted. In truth, it was more complicated than I could handle and overly ambitious. Abandoned. (It also turned out that it had been attempted in the 70s and 80s, and turned out to not be that great :P)<p>3rd project) Got pissed off at a big real world problem. Found a vastly smaller chunk of the problem. This way I can help in a small way and actually finish it.<p>The pattern I've been noticed is that I'm trying to get more ambitious in solving a real problem while vastly scaling down the effort required in my solutions and targeting less competitive markets. I'm amazed at how similar business is to research in that regard. Tackle a reasonably sized problem that has the potential to grow. Declare victory, rinse, repeat. As you gain experience, your perception of tiny will enlarge. :-)<p>Another thing I've noticed within myself, I've started to amaze myself in not seeing any contradiction between helping and asking for money.

The program board member's job was to go to Bill Nye, whilst the tech staff backstage went to get chairs, water, food, and the like. Meanwhile the people in the booth were calling DPS (the on campus police force), and 911.<p>The thing about everyone working that event is that they are all on headset. They were all no doubt following on instructions from their superiors on what was decided to be the best course of action. Whilst it may not have been the most PR friendly response, I can't help but think that having a large swarm of staff all run to Mr. Nye would be nearly as helpful as what (from the best I can tell, both from my experience as a member of the staff (I didn't work the event), and from what I heard from people who did work the event, and audience members as well) actually occurred.<p>Honestly, I'm having a hard time figuring out why this matters to me so much. On the one hand, I know these people, I work with them regularly, and I can't possibly fathom that they just stood there and did nothing. And indeed everything I've heard from trusted sources has been the exact opposite.<p>On the other hand, I'm annoyed that this is receiving as much attention as it is, as I don't think Mr. Nye wanted it that way (again, from what I've heard of him after the event), and I think trying to tie this incident to some sort of great failing of our generation is—frankly—ridiculous.<p>Perhaps the most important thing I'd like to illuminate in this comment would be that there is a far greater number of staff members working any event than the ones that you see, and just because you don't see anyone doing anything doesn't mean that they aren't. Though, yeah, I can imagine it looked bad.",1290060777

I honestly think we could be leaving 50% perf improvement on the floor due to the dynamic nature of the language.<p>And this is on top of the fact that you already have to reduce the amount of time spent optimizing since you don't compile the code ahead of time (most optimistically using a JIT of some sort).<p>Can we please move away from JS and move to a nice IL?",1290060161

And then TSA.<p>Of course in any real analysis of the world, something as sweeping and far reaching as globalization will certainly have some effect on whatever events occurred in the previous ~10-20 years.",1290060115
