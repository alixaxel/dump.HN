1868858,comment,1868411,1868715,0,0,stygianguest,,,"Your argument doesn't seem to apply to most code in natural sciences.
The difference being that their theoretical models are, in most cases, only approximated by code.
Yet, in papers, they claim to prove or test their theoretical model by experiments on the approximation.<p>Note that this is nothing terribly new.
Sometimes experiments testing a hypothesis give false positives because something went wrong in the experiment.
In that sense there is no real difference between a faulty thermometer and a bug in your code.<p>Having written this, I think your argument in fact does apply after all. 
In natural sciences one would argue that if your buggy code confirms an invalid hypothesis, someone redoing your argument with the same code would not uncover the problem. Publishing your code invites people to use your faulty thermomenter.<p>Of course I'm assuming that the published paper contains all necessary details to reproduce the experiment.
In case of e.g. climate models or modelling the formation of galaxies that might be a problem because the code _is_ the experiment.
Describing what code does is very hard, and it would be easier to just publish it in stead.",1288878932

If you're using svn and don't understand how mergeinfo works, then you're not in a position to make a fair comparison on merging. A lot of the comparisons between svn and git/hg/etc. are made by people who don't seem to understand recent versions of svn well.<p>Yes, old versions of svn ""suck at merging"", but the workflows with merges between multiple branches you describe work well in modern versions of svn with merge tracking. Your ""remembering the revision number of the last 'rebase'"" is unnecessary in modern svn.<p>I grant you that switch can take a while on a large code base, as can a checkout of a new working copy. Creating a new branch is contrary to what you say instantaneous in svn due to the cheap copies, however getting that new branch in a new working copy to work on I admit might take a while. A large part of this problem is mitigated if you just have multiple working copies checked out, but not all.<p>The details on why branching is cheap in svn are described here:<p><a href=""http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/subversion-design.html#server.fs.struct.bubble-up"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/notes/subve...</a><p>Part of the problem with svn is that the model is too flexible compared to git: the merge tracking supports tracking partial merges between branches, which is arguably an unnecessary complexity - the svn developers have expressed concern about whether this feature is valuable given the complexity it adds.<p>For general merge scenarios if you're using mergeinfo correctly, follow the practices laid out in the svn book, you shouldn't find merging particularly difficult or expensive in svn, even if you're doing relatively complicated workflows.<p>I'm not saying this is easier or works better than svn than git, just that it's doable and not as bad as many people make out. The merging in svn is (too) complex, but once you figure out how it works then it works well. With your ""I believe...there is mergeinfo"" and loewenskind's ""I've done it. Once."" I get the impression that neither of you have put the time in to really figure out how it works, but are still arguing against it.<p>Personally I prefer the way git works. But as someone who uses it everyday, for scenarios like the ones you say are nightmares, I don't think svn is as bad as you make out. There is an argument to be made for using git, but neither you, loewenskind nor the article make it as well as you could.",1288877178

Further work may then be based on this code, which will result in compound errors.<p>If, however, I carefully describe my algorithm and its purpose in my paper, but <i>don't</i> open source the code, anyone who wishes to reproduce my results will have to re-implement my code, based on my description.

This is a problem for me, since (non-retirement) money is not a significant motivator.<p>This is also true of customers, of course, but there's a bit more leeway and leverage there.<p>> The listed salaries in ads are just for where to start negotiations at :-)<p>Very true.<p>> In any case, if your start up does well, but not so well that you can retire like Brin & Page (exit w/ say $3-5M) you'll find that higher paying offers tend to come a fair bit easier.<p>Interesting. When I reach that range, I won't be accepting offers -- I'll semi-retire. I'd probably work at building a personal submarine like Nautilus UC3 ($200k), doing AI research, building robots and making art.<p>You mention SF and Seattle.
