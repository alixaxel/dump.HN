1855807,comment,1855103,1855103,0,0,thetylerhayes,,,"In my personal experience, you don't necessarily lose relationships (in quality or quantity). It seemed more like a ""weed out the wheat from the chaff"" process.<p>During my first startup, I lost friends. But many were weak links anyway (which is not to say I wasn't sad to lose them). I lost some close friends too, some of whom I'm still not friends with again. It sucks. But c'est la vie -- this is not exclusively an entrepreneur-only experience.<p>I also became much closer to my family, especially my parents. Fortunately, I've had great parents, and they continue to serve as wise advisors. So while I lost some friends, I also made some new friends who are now some of the strongest friends I've ever had, as we share many more things in common (i.e. my old relationships were friends because we went to school together, my new relationships are founded on mutual interest).<p>As for romantic relationships, my first startup officially killed my romantic relationship. But it was not 100% because of my startup, nor is it a story for the Internet. Still, my business was a large factor. You can only care for one love at a time, in my opinion.<p>I don't see any of these as failures, however. They are all growth experiences. I learn more about myself, my friends/family, my business, my interests, the world, and that's just the beginning. I will only judge these as failures when I tried to make something work and despite my truly 100% best efforts I was not able to reach the intended goal.<p>One last thought: maybe it is possible to ""have it all,"" but maybe you just need to re-define ""all."" Personally, to ""have it all"" is not synonymous with having everything at the same time. To me, to ""have it all"" can be spread out over my entire lifetime -- I can run a successful business now, then later meet someone I want to spend the rest of my life with, or vice versa. Or any other combination. Finally, ""have it all"" is different for everybody, so don't let my words define your life. But I hope I've helped at least a bit.",1288601790

Most of our facebook-friends are actually just contacts. Only a subset of those contacts are your real friends. So, the problem is with the name of the concept, not the concept itself.<p>It would be pretty useful if facebook expanded on the concept of labeling contacts and thus making contact subgroups. Yes, putting friends in groups is already possible, but I feel it is highly underpowered. It should rank a lot higher  in the whole user experience and the facebook core itself (separate walls, photos, easier management, easier viewing, easier control).",1288601274

1855786,comment,1855677,1855677,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Yup. Facebook friends trend towards bloat, which is problematic. Twitter followers/followees can be somewhat more manageable because there's a different set of assumptions about what following means vs. ""friending"".<p>The difficulty is that this is a very deep problem, and it is ""solved"" only partially by a very complex, very subtle, very tricky set of societal and personal customs and behaviors. The biggest problem from a social networking service standpoint is that computers very much prefer clear, explicit data, whereas human relationships exist in varying degrees of fuzziness. Most people don't sit down and write out a complete list of everyone who they consider a friend, nor do they create a tiered set of levels of friendships or a ranked list, nor would that necessarily be helpful as such levels are often in flux as friendships change, evolve, grow, and dissolve.<p>This is a problem everywhere with human behavior, it's one of the reasons why google was successful, for example. Back in the day every search engine was very practical and straightforward. Searching a set of terms brought you a list of web pages that had those terms on them, ranked by whatever convenient concrete metric seemed reasonable. To improve the quality of search results people would have to manually provide cues to search engines, via meta tags for example. Google decided instead to use a more sophisticated search strategy, extracting the implicit meta data about web pages via page rank and such-like. In short, google made web search conform to human behavior, rather than trying to get human behavior to conform to the requirements of search.<p>I suspect the same breakthrough is waiting to happen in social networking and will have just as big an impact.",1288600914

Is that how I really look to everyone?  Yep.  But my eyes feel normal at the time, if a bit cold.  If I force them to look like a normal person's eyes, they feel warm and half-closed as if I'm sleepy.  That's it!  In high creativity ""flow"" mode, I'm really <i>really</i> awake and I'm paying attention to my entire visual field.   Perhaps it's akin to looking frightened.  In order to see possible approaching dangers, you pull your eyelids back so they don't block peripheral vision as much.  You don't necessarily roll your eyes, but when your eyelids are so wide open, any glancing to the side exposes the whites of your eyes.  Very noticeable to onlookers.  (So then when I go out in public, I have to make sure to squint and pretend to look sleepy!)<p>Sheer speculation: ancient tribes might survive better if their members evolved to display certain unconscious instinctual facial expressions.

When I've put myself into an extreme creative state, I'll notice that my eyes feel cold w/wide open lids exposing more surface.

I certainly feel that way.<p>However, comparing the impact on the larger world, I really really think Facebook has made way more impact than we care to admit.  They got the whole world on a single social network.  They created the newsfeed, some thing which is ubiquitous across all sites now.  The Facebook platform, though buggy and heinous was completely revolutionary when they launched it.  They created a single sign on that is used by a staggering number of people across the web.<p>Personally, Facebook's innovation over MySpace is every bit as impressive as Google over Altavista or MapQuest.  We may not value the ends, but 500,000,000 users with orders of magnitude more engagement than Google is undeniable impact.",1288598891
