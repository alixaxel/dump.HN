1926448,comment,1926402,1926402,0,0,lukev,,,"Depends on what you want to use it for.<p>If you want to create powerful, intricate production apps, you're probably better off with CL. It's got better libraries, a bigger community, and more history.<p>If, on the other hand, you're interested in learning Lisp for the purity, the ""aha"" moments, and to become a better programmer, I'd have to recommend Scheme. It's a lot simpler, more self-consistent, with an order of magnitude less confusing bits and ""gotchas"". But it's still every bit as good at showing why Lisp is awesome.<p>And, of course, I must mention Clojure, which aside from the JVM cruft is much ""cleaner"" than CL, but just as powerful and ready for production use. It's also even more intensely focused on functional programming than Scheme OR CL.",1290319024

You've neither pointed out a specific flaw in nerfhammer's argument, nor answered waterside81's question for clarification.<p>All you're doing is reminding us that hard core libertarians hate almost everything that government does, and that they all consider most things that governments try to do to be bad for the economy.<p>You can't successfully argue that a particular action is bad by falling back on the base libertarian dogma that <i>all</i> actions of that sort are bad, or at least you can't do it without offering at least some independent support for the base dogma.  We already know that <i>you</i> believe it; what we're asking is why <i>we</i> should believe it in the context of this individual example.<p>There are dozens of possible responses you could give, I've come up with several myself, but frankly, I can come up with many arguments for both sides of the issue, so I'm of the mind that it's likely something we'd need to see a bit of empirical data on to be sure.<p>One of the few things I know for sure about econ is that first-principle-based arguments tend to be complete and utter trash whenever they measure up against real world tests.",1290319010

For instance, when I needed to run 3 simulated microcontrollers in a simulator that supported circuit plugins but only one microcontroller per simulation, this new way of thinking led me to realize: instead of trying to make the single simulator support 3 cpus, simply run 3 copies of the simulator process (and use tcp/ip to link them, via custom circuit plugins).  I think, that once we embrace separate processes for concurrency instead of threads, we'll begin to see how abandoning the shared memory model can actually make some things simpler.",1290318028

1926367,comment,1925399,1925399,0,0,jbeda,,,"A trick to save memory:<p>If you have a struct/class with a lot of members that are usually set to zero or some other initial value, you can store them in a ""lookaside"" structure that is hung off a global hash table with the pointer of the original object as the hashtable key.  You can then use a bitfield to keep track of which members actually have interesting data.<p>So -- accessing the member would look something like this:<p><pre><code>  int MyClass::get_foo() {
    if (foo_set_)
      return global_lookaside[this].foo;
    return 0;
  }</code></pre>",1290316151

Later on, you can do ""goto *ptr"" to jump back to that address.  Neat.

They're against a positive right to see a doctor and get regular treatment, but are <i>in favor</i> of a positive right to receive emergency-room care if necessary. Hence, ERs are required to treat heart-attack and stroke patients who show up on their doorstep, even if the victim is uninsured and has no ability to pay; turning them away is illegal.<p>So the question isn't over whether there's a positive right to health care--- almost everyone agrees there is to some extent. The disagreement is over which kinds of care are included in the right.",1290316106
