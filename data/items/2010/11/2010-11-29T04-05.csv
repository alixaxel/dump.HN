Everything Gibson said in this interview was interesting and worthwhile. But I found Spook Country mediocre and I am unlikely to read Zero History. I'm trying to come to grips with that. On the surface, I can say that I found it much easier to empathize with Chia or Cayce than with Holly.<p>My best distillation so far is that he used to write about people, technologies, and their relationships, with some peripheral stuff about brands. Now he writes about brands - and people and technologies have become a means to that end. Also the brands used to be fictional, which helped avoid the Spook Country feeling of reading some company's ad copy. Perhaps as a result of the emphasis on brands, his character are less sympathetic. They have always been out of control of their own lives, but they used to try to take control now and then. In Spook Country they seemed more abject, victims of forces far beyond their ken or control. I have no doubt that he has a valid point of view, and he is somewhat upfront about that shift, in this interview. But his interests no longer match mine.",1291006742

1949413,comment,1948756,1949176,0,0,brc,,,"I think this is a bit revisionist at best.  One of the defining characteristics of post-war West Germany was the embracing of free markets and de-regulated business.  The most influential post-war Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard was a fierce proponent of liberal economic theory and laid down the foundation for the decades of strong growth that West Germany experienced.  He flatly rejected calls for subsidisation of industry and threw out all the price controls that had been in place.<p>In contrast to the UK, which went the other direction after the war and nationalised and socialised so much that it's economy was moribund by the 1970's, in complete isolation with the emerging powerhouse that was the West German economy.<p>Sure, the Germans have had a problem with unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular, but they enjoy a high standard of living and a stable and prosperous economy.  And the unemployment rate has been dropping since the conservative-minded government has been in power.  It is now lower than most US states.<p>So I would contend that Germany, particularly throughout the period from 1950-1980 was following a classical liberal economic philosophy more closely than just about any other Western country, the US included.  And the results showed.  Though I would say it was more Austrian school based than Chicago.<p>I also don't agree with your assertion that socialism is required to keep an industry going.   For that you just need an export-led manufacturing sector, good technical training in schools, and to keep the finance sector in it's place, instead of being allowed to dominate the economy and thus wield political power.<p>Interestingly enough, the Germans haven't had a housing crash because there was no housing boom.  And that's because there was no attempt to change the ownership levels amongst people who didn't own a home.",1291006221

1949406,comment,1949158,1949335,0,0,dkarl,,,"The advice against trying to beat the market is based on the fact that there are tens of thousands of highly intelligent people paid to analyze securities, and they're all feeding off each other's behavior.  To beat the market, you have to beat a conventional wisdom based on the accumulated expertise of a lot of people.  For instance, if you want to buy stock in a Malaysian steel company, you have to decide that you understand the current value of this stock better than a crowd-sourced price generated by the research of a horde of steel industry specialists, people with intimate knowledge of the Malaysian economy, business environment, and political environment, people who can afford to spend all day reading forecasts of economic conditions in the countries where this company's steel is consumed, and people who have a drink with a VP from the company and get gossip about the CEO's health and the competence of his likely successor.<p>If no one was trying to beat the market, it would be easy to beat the market.  But since so many people are busy trying, it's silly to try to compete unless you want to take it as seriously as the professionals do and get plugged in the way they are.<p>The ""random walk"" hypothesis says you <i>can</i> beat the professionals.  About half the time.  By flipping a coin.  But the professionals are insiders, and as well-regulated as the stock market is, I would assume that an outsider playing against insiders in a 50/50 game will not quite win his full 50% share.<p>The hope that a person can price stocks better than the market as a whole rests on a couple of possibilities:<p>1.  Beating full-time professional analysts at analysis in your spare time, because you're just so bad-ass.<p>2.  Identifying a price that is heavily influenced by ignorant people and beating them by just being reasonably well-informed -- but this is not an original idea and hence is a special case of #1.<p>3.  Finding a niche that you know intimately for some reason, and in which you have no professional competition.  Oh, wait, this is just #2 again.  Or maybe you found a niche small enough that it doesn't get a lot of attention from professional analysts, and you can make a little bit of money at it.  That might work!<p>4.  Being the first one to take into account a new idea or source of information.  This one will make you wildly rich, and it's fun to dream, but while you're looking for that brilliant idea, there's no reason to risk real money on your ideas-in-progress.",1291005923

This is very good for the companies which export a lot, but is pretty bad for everyone else (including its neighbours).<p>Economic improvemnts are mainly coming from productivity gains - artificially lowering your costs instead of trying to build more with less is not a sustainable past.

All the usual cliches are there.<p>This story has been told for <i>years</i> in Europe, especially in France, where it is said we should follow the German way. It is very ingrained in the news reporting and the general level of discussions. One striking example is the French left and right discussing about Germany: both will assume that German growth has been better than France, and the left will claim that it shows growths is not well shared, and the right will use it as the proof that salaries are too high in France.

Most of the value in most software businesses comes from development, design, optimisation, sales, marketing and so on. In particular, selling software to large companies is a slow, expensive process that has little if anything to do with the quality of your software. You mention AI and NLP in the comments, which makes me slightly nauseous as regards the actual commercial prospects of your software - such projects tend to be academically impressive but monstrously expensive and near-impossible to market. Obviously I'm purely speculating, but I'd suggest getting your product out of academia as quickly as you can and talk to your potential customers. It's very easy to waste years of your life and a pile of VC money on a brilliant product that nobody wants. If you haven't read Steve Blank's ""Four Steps to the Epiphany"", stop reading this and go buy a copy now.<p>Open sourcing a project has many potential benefits. It looks excellent on your CV and is usually the best way of getting hired by someone you'd actually want to work for, as it proves that you can actually program. If your software becomes widely used, there are excellent opportunities for consulting, writing proprietary add-ons, books, speaking engagements and so on.<p>You say ""i don't want some big company coming and taking my source and putting it into their product even if they do credit me"". In fact, that's exactly what you want, because overnight you become the world's leading expert on a product by a big company, with everything that entails. GPL it and they can't distribute the software without also distributing the source. They can use the software internally of course, but guess who they're going to want to hire if it becomes mission-critical? That's the basic reason to open source a piece of software - it opens the possibility for other people to develop, market and become reliant upon software you wrote.<p>If you're willing to bet every penny you have and every minute of your life for the next ten years, then make a business of it as a proprietary product. You've got a great deal to lose, but you could end up richer than Croesus. If you open source it, all sorts of opportunities may open up for you with very little effort on your part.",1291005073

He tells the U.S. Ambassador that the Soviets have broken the Americans’ secret code. “We know they know our code,” the Ambassador, Moulsworth, replies, beaming. “We only give them things we want them to know.” The general pauses, during which, the play’s stage directions say, “he tries to make head or tail of this intelligence.” Then he crosses the street to the Russian Embassy, where he tells the Soviet Ambassador, Romanoff, “They know you know their code.” Romanoff is unfazed: “We have known for some time that they knew we knew their code. We have acted accordingly—by pretending to be duped.” The general returns to the American Embassy and confronts Moulsworth: “They know you know they know you know.” Moulsworth (genuinely alarmed): “What? Are you sure?”</i><p>...<p><i>At one point, the British discovered that a French officer in Algiers was spying for the Germans. They “turned” him, keeping him in place but feeding him a steady diet of false and misleading information. Then, before D Day—when the Allies were desperate to convince Germany that they would be invading the Calais sector in July—they used the French officer to tell the Germans that the real invasion would be in Normandy on June 5th, 6th, or 7th. The British theory was that using someone the Germans strongly suspected was a double agent to tell the truth was preferable to using someone the Germans didn’t realize was a double agent to tell a lie. Or perhaps there wasn’t any theory at all.
