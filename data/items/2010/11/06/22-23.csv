1877984,comment,1877680,1877680,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"I worked as an actual games reviewer a few years ago, before leaving to focus my spare time on becoming a novelist. Game reviewing was rather thankless work (but that is rather off topic for now).<p>Wii: The Wii Controller allows us great control whilst allowing us the full control of still having access to all our regular keys and analog sticks, giving us the familiarity and allowing a wide range of actions to be controlled.<p>Move: I'm a mature adult male and I would feel more comfortable waving an oversized dildo about in a downtown high street than playing a game with a luminescent ball on a stick. Beyond that, the Move limits the user immensely by requiring them to set aside their actual controller. The advantage is that you can use two controllers, which doesn't give any advantage over the Wii in motion control but allows both to be tracked by the Eye. The disadvantage is that a game requiring 2 controllers means only 2 players.<p>Kinect: This is the most technologically advanced of the three and also one-ups the other two by using voice recognition software. The processing is only partially on the 360. Furthermore it allows for the motion-control and voice recognition to be used in combination with a controller. Simply the voice recognition could be very useful in lots of games, especially in RPG's like Mass Effect or Dragon Age to allow switching of weapon sets without requiring menu access, and I'm sure developers will come up with my ingenious ideas than just that.<p>In 3rd place is Move mostly for the crappy design but also cause of the restricted playability; 2nd place is Wii, mostly because the potential has still yet to be tapped by developers, but the controller is rather cumbersome when games inevitably end up being your standard analog stick and trigger affair. 1st place is Kinect, because at worst you still have a usable controller whilst playing. At best you have motion tracking, voice recognition and a controller. Providing either the motion tracking or the voice recognition get well used, it's still going to be kicking the other two's asses in terms of changing the market.<p>However, as always time will tell. Kinect may not live up to any of its potential, but right now it stands to go much further than the other two in revolutionizing gameplay. Move right now shows me nothing new, but is far worse design and implementation than the Wii or Kinect.",1289084314

I may be totally wrong on this point, but it seems to me that over-engineering (in the forms of feature-creep, premature optimization, premature scaling, over-specification, planning for too many unlikely use cases, and all its other myriad forms) is often a tunnel-vision problem, a feature of the blessing/curse of engineers' tendency to focus really hard on a single thing.<p>If you look at the single-page source code to Plan 9's implementation of the cat command, and then compare it to GNU's, you can almost see it directly.  The Plan 9 coders were looking more broadly at the OS and knew they'd need a cat command, while the GNU coders were thinking just about the Unix userspace, so when Plan 9 had cat, they continued hacking by moving to the next thing, but when GNU had it, they continued hacking by stuffing more things into cat.<p>Hackers love hacking, and this is great for the hackers and the users, but one rarely hears ""This program is sufficient.  I will consider it complete and write a different one until it becomes clear that the program is insufficient.""  (I don't exempt myself here.)

Then when people do the same for Apple and add the other iOS devices, then articles as the one in the OP are born. Read my post again, because you're agreeing with me kind sir.<p>2) Here you're assuming that the users actually care about the iOS vs Android wars. A regular user who has an Android phone will not buy another Android phone because of its OS, they'll buy it because it's marketed as the successor of the phone they used before. By your example a regular user of Blackberry phones would easily move to another brand because it used the same Blackberry OS, or a iPhone user would move to a different phone manufacturer because he was told it also has iOS. This is simply not true. Nexus One users are more likely to buy a Nexus Two (and not a HTC Magic 2 in contrast) and iPhone4 users are more prone to buying a iPhone5 because of the product loyalty and brand popularity inherent in both choices. Industry trajectory is not measured by who has the most amount of devices with an specific OS out there, it's measured on who has the most amount of POPULAR devices period. Twelve years ago, people bought Nokia phones because they where the most popular ones around, not because they used Symbian OS.<p>On the downloadable app part you seem to equate quantity with quality, which is flawed at best. Quality developers will flock to the platform that is more profitable and merchantable. You're right, the most popular platform is the one that will get more developer attention, but device share is not a measure of popularity in the mobile app sector. Profits are.",1289081867

1877886,comment,1877003,1877003,0,0,Dove,,,"There are three tools for discovering truth and making decisions: reason, intuition, and revelation.<p>Revelation means ask an expert, read the documentation.  It is most appropriate when you don't know what you're doing at all -- when you have no sound first principles to feed into the engine of reason, and no experience on which to build intuition.  Revelation is fast but limited; you instantly gain a conclusion as sound as your expert, but you cannot improve upon  or critique it.<p>Reason is most appropriate when you have moderate experience in a field.  Through revelation and limited experience, you have developed some sound, inviolable principles, and can reason your ways to new ones.  You know what <i>must</i> go here because you know what <i>must</i> go there, and you can figure out how <i>this</i> works because you know how <i>that</i> works.  Reason converges to truth slowly but inexorably.  It <i>will</i> eventually get there.  But it takes a long time to process a lot of input or to navigate a complex landscape.<p>Intuition is an appropriate tool when you have high experience in a field.  Even presented with a complex problem, you know what to do.  You just know that OO is the wrong paradigm for this, and that code <i>must</i> go on the server, and this bug is almost certainly caused by a mismatched type somewhere in the parser.  Given time, you could probably justify it.  Doing so would be equivalent work to writing a paper -- there's just a lot of stuff to consider and weigh.  But the power of intuition is that you can decide nearly instantly, and often decide <i>right</i>.  Intuition as a tool doesn't converge to truth; it quickly leaps, and then it either gets there or it doesn't.  And even when does get there, you don't know immediately whether it actually worked or not.  It always uncertain, being only as good as your necessarily incomplete mental models.  But there are times when a fast guess is way better than a slow conclusion.   And there are times certainty isn't possible anyway.  One problem with intuition is that you can't improve its results for a particular problem.  If it's wrong, it's just plain wrong.  You can't doggedly grind on like you could with reason, or ask another source like you can with revelation.<p>The highest level of competence comes from using all three tools in concert.  With a lot of experience, revelation is sharp: you know who the experts are and what they are likely to know.  Reason is sharp: you know a lot of useful rules, and the fastest ways to check truth for certainty.  Intuition is sharp: you have a feel for the rhythm of the hills and valleys in the problem landscape.  You can guess the existence of a distant mountain the hill-climbing rationalist would take forever to find, quickly and soundly check the local landscape for its unexpected little pits and spikes, and borrow a <i>good</i> map to cross a desert quickly.<p>This engine of canny guesses and rapid checks and good borrowed maps is precisely what makes communities of hackers work so impossibly, frighteningly fast.",1289081423
