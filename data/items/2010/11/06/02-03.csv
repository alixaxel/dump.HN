Your side merely capitalizes on the present legal murkiness of the software/copyright issue.  Console manufacturers, phone manufacturers, and a legion of other device manufacturers have spent three decades capitalizing on abuses of patent and copyright law.<p>Patents exist not to lock out competition or allow total control over an invention, but as a method for making sure your work isn't stolen (for a limited time) and thus give you a commercial incentive to innovate.

1875758,comment,1875593,1875666,0,0,bravura,,,"There are two aspects of the problem that I consider particularly interesting: a) defining the problem, because being able to define the prob­lem and jus­tify your answer is half the puzzle in a lot of NLP work. b) scaling to a corpus of this size (vocabulary of 1M), because this scale is tricky but useful in many web problems.<p>Semioticians typically distinguish between <i>paradigmatic</i> and <i>syntagmatic</i> axes of semantic relatedness. Paradigmatic means that two words occur with similar other words, e.g. these two words typically have the same word immediately to their left, like ""blue"" and ""azure"". Syntagmatic means that the words typically co-occur in usage, like ""blue"" and ""sky"".

Green is what you experience when (roughly) the difference between the amount of light w/ those wavelengths and the amount of light w/ wavelengths outside that range is greater than it was a (temporally) little while ago, or in comparison with the light coming in from areas nearby, and strongly affected by reasoning about what color the object ""should"" be, and what the quality of light is that is hitting the object. As you say, green is a ""feeling"", not embodied in the light itself, but only meaningful in the brain. So the ""color"" of a neutral gray card (or even something which emits no light at all) surrounded by a bright red object or looked at just after a bright red object is just as ""legitimately"" green as the light reflected from a ""green"" piece of paper or emitted by a ""green"" LED.",1289009386
