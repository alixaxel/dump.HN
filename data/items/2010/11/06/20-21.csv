I got so into JS, that I started writing more logic in the client, because I could, and because JS, with it's loose typing and object notation was just a fast place to write code.<p>Now, two years later, I've embarked on a large project, an HMI in an industrial sector, and I of course made heavy use of jQuery. After 4000 LOC, the program needed some serious re-factoring in order to handle the next level of complexity.<p>To handle the complex demands of the application, I decided to use the Closure Compiler, which is great! The only problem is, that now, I'm writing typed code, in a non-typed language, and there's not much to really like about the language, besides the fact it's on all web browsers and has a ton of third-party support.<p>I guess my point is: I think tools like Closure Compiler and others which produce ""compiled Javascript"" are the future, if anything is. Maybe we'll see Python, or Java get JS like support in the browser, but if I could talk to the me from two years ago, I'd tell him: ""Start using the  Closure Compiler, and use less jQuery.""",1289075805

It's all explained upfront, which seems to improve the readability of the compacted code. This habit has spilled over to other languages with no implicit structure so that code is organized between descriptive comment blocks.

1877701,comment,1877294,1877294,0,0,jwr,,,"I disagree with the author. I've yet to see an abstraction layer that doesn't end up as the lowest common denominator of all databases supported or becomes a leaky abstraction.<p>Databases are different — accept it. I use PostgreSQL and Redis — there is really little they have in common and I use them for completely different purposes. I can't see how you could stuff all that into a single abstraction. I mean, in my Clojure code I use SQL transactions in one part of the program and Redis' optimistic locking (WATCH/MULTI/EXEC) in the other. They are _different_ and they are supposed to be different.<p>I also believe that the whole story about how difficult it is to ""switch databases"" is a red herring. If your code isn't a pile of spaghetti, then your database access functions are grouped together, not spread all over the place. This usually means that instead of abstracting the database with a generic database API, you abstract the database with <i>your</i> API, which only performs the operations you need.<p>If you do that, then a) switching databases isn't that difficult, b) your ""database DSL"" becomes <i>your</i> DSL, not somebody else's.<p>As a practical example, my code has a namespace called ""distributed"" which abstracts distributed synchronization using Redis. I can call (distributed/register-server), or (distributed/dequeue-job). The functions are very short, and really consist of redis-clojure calls with minimal database logic. Now <i>that</i> is a DSL I like.",1289075698

Intuition isn't too helpful unless you know something about the problem domain. Similarly, rational thinking can't really warp to anything truly new without intuition: the rational mind per se can only take what is already known and expand it a bit.

Recently started bizdev-people consistently underestimate the time requirements for certain well-exercised tasks.<p>Some of the most common icebergs are:<p>-form validation (seriously -one of the most highly exercised user-interaction paths; it's all over the place, and scales semi-exponentially with the number of fields)<p>-search (""how hard could it be? you just put an input form there, then figure out what the user thought, then display it"" -exact quote)<p>-anything that has to process natural language. I mean <i>everything</i>. Wanna split up a text into sentences? How do you differentiate between dr. mr., 2004. jun. , and valid sentence-enders? Generating a definite article (""a"", ""an"") before a noun? Keep in mind that 1,2,@,$,=, and other characters might also be valid noun first-letters :)\netc.<p>In my experience, the best anti-iceberg pattern is to follow a portfolio approach, and for each requirements which smells like iceberg, have a fallback plan in place -ie. after N hours of sunken investment, execution shifts to plan B.
