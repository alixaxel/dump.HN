1887705,comment,1887442,1887571,0,0,gte910h,,,"(Apoligies, HN is mangling my comment when I try to include C style comments, so I'm using C99/C++ style ones)<p>You should include whatever .h files you need in every file that uses them (things like stdlib and stdio for sure when you're using them). This makes it so you have fewer interfile dependencies which keeps your compile times down. So you only include other .h files in .h files if you need the types in them (or put a blank prototype in for it, aka struct foo;). Otherwise you include .h files only in .c files.<p>Feels hairy, yes, but that's the correct way to do it. By doing it creative ways, you cause great pain down the road (especially compilation times, and hunting for simple bugs).  If you're only using one or two functions, sometimes people just prototype the function:<p>// some people just would stick this prototype in their .c<p>//file they're writing if they need nothing else in math.h<p>double sqrt(double x);<p>I think you're missing something about C there though the way you talk about compiling things.<p>h files aren't really compiled at all. They are substituted into files where they're #included. You can actually write your entire project without them if you really want to (not suggested, but you can) by just putting prototypes for the functions you call at the top of the c files that need to copy them. That's actually why its important to put guard include statements at the beginning and end of h files to make sure they aren't included more than once. A properly written h file shouldn't cause compiler errors when you do this to it:<p>#include ""foo.h""<p>#include ""foo.h""<p>#include ""foo.h""<p>#include ""foo.h""<p>#include ""foo.h""`<p>The way you make it proper is you do this the top:<p>#ifndef __FOO_H__<p>#define __FOO_H__<p>and this at the bottom<p>#endif // __FOO_H__<p>Many IDEs do this automatically and vim and emacs both have plugins you can get to do this. Robert Pike's piece is from 1989, when computers ran much slower. The lexical analysis time from this is not worth talking about anymore.<p>Structure:<p>Generally C is structured with a main .c file which has a few functions related to start up in it and includes of header files in other modules which are needed. Each of the .c files includes the header files it needs, from either internal project modules, or from system level header files (aka <thingsInAlligatorBrackets.h>).  Generally each .c file  is a module, although in Object Oriented C, you may find modules built up of several different c files with each ""class family"" in a single .c files. Modules are purely conceptual in C.<p>Some C people get macro happy. Do no do this.  It is unclear to the rest of the C developing universe. Modern C compilers can do inline substitution quite well, often giving better performance than your macros. When people get macro happy, they end up making a file like ""GlobalMacros.h"" or even if they don't, they just have a lot of constants and end up with ""LotsOfConstants.h"" included in everything.<p>Resist the urge to put your .h includes in there but NOT in the files that actually depend on it. If you do that you break code if that .h file is ever taken out.<p>As far as final compilation goes: Every C file is compiled into an object file then linked using the linker. Alternatively, groups of .c files are compiled into .o files then linked into .a files (static libraries). These libraries are then linked in during the final compilation step.",1289332785

I can mentally translate snippets of code into assembly much like the compiler would. And that's what I like about programming, that you tell the hardware how to solve a particular problem and implement a certain algorithm. D retains that property while letting you use more higher-level abstractions than C++ 0x, and nicer syntax in things like templates.<p>When I first went from C++ to D I was very sceptical about it using garbage collection, but accepted it since you're not forced to use it. (I thought R-value references had to be the ultimate solution.)
But now I'm quite sold on it. I think it manages memory in a more elegant way than R-value references and reference-counting do, and you can get closures and efficient strings and arrays for free.",1289332518

I'm not sure if it's better in 32-bit, but there's frankly no way I'm going to compromise on my browser choice purely because of Adobe's incompetence. It usually freezes or drops down to maybe 5 FPS when I make a video full screen, it constantly uses a ridiculous amount of CPU time, it crashes tabs, and the font rendering is as shitty as ever.<p>I love when videos are on Vimeo because all of their videos play natively, and when I click on a YouTube video, I'm always hoping that it isn't one of the Flash-only videos that I need to switch to Firefox to watch. HTML5 might be in its infancy, but it already sucks a lot less than Flash, at least for those of us that aren't using Windows.<p>The issue isn't just performance—it's who I want controlling web technologies. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are open standards that anyone can implement. Whether or not the performance is the same right now, I have way more faith in Mozilla, Apple, Google and Opera than I have in Adobe (and if they all drop the ball, someone else will pick it up). Adobe definitely has talented engineers, but they've demonstrated again and again that they're just not capable of making Flash stable and efficient. I'm not sure if this is the legacy cruft built up in Flash, a lack of interest in performance on platforms besides Windows, or just pure incompetence, but I don't care. They've had over 5 years (over 10 if you count Macromedia) to work their shit out, and they haven't.<p>Flash may have had a role back when web technologies just weren't up the task for displaying any kind of rich content, but that day has passed. It's telling that the vast majority of articles I've read defending Flash are written by people who directly profit from Flash continuing to be a relevant technology. Some are Flash evangelists, others are just people who decided to hitch their careers to Flash and are just now coming to terms with what a bad decision that was, and a few just plain don't understand what they're talking about (e.g. Dave Winer). This author isn't one of them—he's actually provided a reasoned argument, and the awesome CSS3 stuff he's been putting out shows that he's not just blindly defending the only tool he knows—but people like him seem to be few and far between.",1289330572

1887556,comment,1884052,1884052,0,0,scottdw2,,,"I didn't like the essay much. The comparison with medeival medicine is a little shallow. One big problem he misses, is that unlike medeival medicine, computer science theory is well developed. CS has a solid theoretical foundation. The schism between engineers and academics mainly comes from the fact that ""formal verification methods"" are either not acheivable in practice, or require constraining a problem to a point where the verified software is not useful for anything.<p>Formal verification requires ""ground truth"". Something external that defines what the program should do, exactly. That's possible in some cases (a CPU emulator, for example, can be verified against a physical CPU). Most of the time, however, that doesn't exist.<p>That means what's usually necessary is a formal description of a formal semantics. Those things, almost universally, require either creating a Turing Complete semantic description language (to allow the semantics to be rich enough to express the solution), or a verry simple problem domain.<p>In the Turing Complete case, the formal spec degenerates to the program. That leaves you in a case where you are proving that the program does what the program does, which is useless.<p>The problem with simple domains is that they violate the law of leaky abstractions. All abstractions leak. Simple domains can rarely solve real problems. This is true even for cases like bison and flex. There is a reason most compilers use hand written parsers: they need to be usable by people. Once you move away from ""I want a Boolean function that says if string S is in language Y"" to ""I want to provide usefull error output that helps people figure out the mistakes they have made, and I want to provide contextually relevant assistance in authoring code"" the formal model falls apart.<p>So my prediction is this:<p>""Attempts to raise the level of abstraction (provided it's possible to escape to lower levels), will succeeded. Formal verification, however, is a myth"".",1289330212

Apparently this dangerous shipment was uncovered by good old-fashioned intelligence work in the form of a tip-off, which is the message that we ought to be sending - 'we have spies everywhere, fanatics can easily be deceived or corrupted.'<p>Personally, I don't think there was actually any intent to blow up an airplane. It's a possibility, of course, but an explosion in cargo airliner doesn't upset people en masse beyond sympathy for the families of the crew. And if it were a dry run, then the fake printer consumables would have been addressed to a dead address or a collaborator. That they were sent to a Jewish organization, and given that such devices have onboard electronics activated by current, it's a much more reasonably supposition that they hoped to blow up someone leaning over a printer.<p>The fact is that there are any number of electronic devices which could conceivably be packed with explosives and fitted with a detonator designed to go off when current is applied. I'm typing on such a device right now; I've never opened up this keyboard and for all I know it could go off <i>at any moment</i>. I count 13 similar devices on or underneath my desk right now, and some would be very difficult to detect even on close inspection. High-quality speakers, for example, are heavy, draw electrical power, and have big magnets in them by necessity, which would probably throw off many kinds of electrostatic detectors. Millions of them are shipped every day; we simply cannot inspect every last package shipped.<p>It seems quite reasonably to temporarily block all shipments from failed states like Somalia or Yemen. But adding each new bomb format to an ever-growing list of prohibited items is an exercise in futility. At some point one of these fanatics with a little more media savvy and imagination is going to hit on the idea of exploiting this reactive behavior and start sending out lots of dud bombs encased in popular or ubiquitous formats purely to provoke bans and cause economic injury - digital music players, handheld videogames, laptops all seem likely candidates. I avoided mentioning any popular brands but I think we can all imagine the the consequences if a few well-engineered explosive versions were 'accidentally' discovered by security professionals.<p>For that matter, with the holiday season coming it would be easy to throw a wrench into Santa's supply chain that would lead to grim-faced security workers impounding everything from Barbies to blankies. Let's hope nobody in Al Qaeda has read <i>the Grinch That Stole Christmas</i>.",1289330166

1887512,comment,1887306,1887306,0,0,alki,,,"I often wonder if the mild alcoholism of my youth (drinking to blackout roughly once every month, starting at age 16) has given me any lasting impairment.  Certainly, I have no terrible damage since I am highly functional at an intellectually demanding job.  But I've always wondered if I took an edge off my memory.  My ""prospective memory"" (remembering to complete tasks without reminder) seems to be much worse than average, but it's hard to tell if this is within natural variation and, even if so, if my alcohol use affected it.<p>I've read in a few places that alcoholism in children and teens leads to demonstrated long-term memory effects, especially for prospective memory.  Does anyone know the level of alcohol consumption at which this effect becomes measurable?  Is this damage permanent? (My google-fu seems inadequate.)<p>I suspect that researchers simply don't have the data to make precise confident statements about damage that is marginal (and, hence, is hard to measure).",1289329475

Anyone join me?",,"So I decided I should do this some time, just to change the scenes and boost productivity, so this December I'm probably moving to Thailand for 2-6 months where I'm going to code the hell out of my current projects. However I'm not really sure where do I ask a couple of things I'm concerned about. I was hoping some HN people lived/are living there and could give me a valuable advice.<p>I'm mostly concerned about renting an apartment:
1. Is it a good idea to look up an apartment on the internet (if so, what's the best website?)
2. What are the usual agencies fees and other conditions there? How much do you actually pay if you get an apartment for $x? Is it $2x? $3x?
3. What can go wrong in the process of renting an apartment?
4. I heard that most apartments are rented for 6 months or more. Does that mean I lose some money if I move out earlier?<p>Also, if anyone was thinking about doing the same, you are welcome to join me. Not suggesting living together, but meeting up and making friends could be exciting. And I would also be glad to meet people who already live there.<p>Thanks, HN.",1289329310
