1926105,comment,1925884,1926061,0,0,_delirium,,,"That's a version of the ""negative income tax"", like the current EITC, but not the one that Friedman proposed. His version refunds a proportion of unused deductions, and bottoms out at a guaranteed minimum income equal to the standard deduction times the refund rate.<p>In his version, there's an allowance calculated by family size, dependents, etc., and a ""subsidy rate"", which is the proportion of any excess allowance that's refundable. He proposed a 50% subsidy rate. If the allowance for a given taxpayer is $20,000, and the taxpayer earns $15,000, that leaves $5,000 in unused allowance, of which 50% is refunded, so the taxpayer gets a $2,500 transfer payment. If the taxpayer earns no income at all, the entire $20,000 is unused, of which 50% is refunded, so the taxpayer gets a $10,000 transfer payment.<p>So, if A is allowance, S is subsidy rate, and W is wages, the taxpayer earns W if W >= A, or W + S * (A-W) otherwise. The guaranteed minimum income is when W=0, and equal to S * A ($10,000 in the above example).<p>For Hayek, here's one of several places he discusses his rationale: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=nclLLOfnGqAC&pg=PA55"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=nclLLOfnGqAC&pg=PA55</a>. One reason is that, unlike many libertarians, he's strongly <i>against</i> private-sector safety nets through e.g. church charities, because he feels those inhibit human freedom by making people scared to leave their ethnic/religious/racial/social group for fear of losing its safety net, which he views as a variety of collectivism. So he sees a guaranteed minimum income as a way of promoting individual freedom and undermining the power of tribalist collectives.",1290308314

  * They will place weak students in classes where they don't belong just to maintain the appearance that they are serving a useful function (""Sure X failed biology and he'll be lucky to get into community college, but I'm recommending that he take chemistry b/c it looks good on his transcript"").
  * They will protect troublesome students to the detriment of other students (""You can't keep X out of class all the time.  You're just going to have to learn to control him"")<p>Students and Parents are as much of the problem as the teachers and the administration: There is often a pervasive attitude of entitlement without any effort amongst the students and their parents.

The huge increase in the number of dialysis patients is overwhelmingly attributable to these two causes. In the vast majority of these cases, renal failure can be prevented with relatively inexpensive intervention to better manage the primary condition.<p>In most other developed countries, it is politically straightforward to spend $20,000 a year on coaxing and cajoling a patient into managing their diabetes better in order to prevent them from becoming a $70,000 a year dialysis patient. Needless to say that the benefits to this approach are greater than just a cost saving.<p>The United States has a quite peculiar set of popular attitudes to healthcare. It is clear that a large number of US citizens believe that healthcare ought not be a universal right, but most also find it unpalatable to simply allow people to die of preventable diseases. Consequently, cheap early intervention to preserve health is often shunned in favour of expensive, late intervention to prevent death. To my mind the most egregious example of this is drug abuse and alcoholism - huge amounts are spent on ER care for disastrously ill addicts, but little is spent on basic social work and rehabilitation.<p>I can't honestly say that I understand the mindset that completely opposes government involvement in healthcare, but it seems obvious to me that the current situation is the worst of all worlds - the worst outcomes and the highest costs.

So, much of what is written is true, but much is also a bit slanted too.<p>So, mortality rates on dialysis do suck.  It's not necessarily a reflection of bad care, though that certainly happens.   Once you require dialysis, that means your kidneys are trashed.  They don't work well enough to function, so you need kidney replacement therapy.   This generally doesn't happen in isolation.  If your kidneys are that damaged, you generally have serious underlying health problems (diabetes, high blood pressure) that have also affected your brain and heart... so it's only a (short) matter of time before you have a devastating event.<p>There are diseases which only affect the kidneys in isolation, and those people tend to live a long time on dialysis.<p>The comparisons to foreign countries is always important but I feel like the article dismisses some of the country-specific factors<p><i>""Yet Italy spends about one-third less than we do per patient. These results reflect lower overall health-care costs and a __patient population with lower rates of diabetes and heart disease__, but also important divergences in policy and practice.""</i><p>Less diabetes and heart disease would be a huge factor in the difference in spending and mortality rates.   Those are massive implications, and also indicate that their dialysis patients might be due to different (less systemic) diseases.<p>In the end, it's probably only one factor.  I think it's likely that underlying U.S. cultural differences are another.  I believe expectations and beliefs about death and elderly may be different abroad, though I don't have any citations for that.  In the U.S., it's seems hard to deny people dialysis.   I'd be curious what the average age of people on dialysis in the U.S. vs abroad are.  I expect the U.S. average age would be much higher.<p>I think american families tend to want dialysis and are more reluctant to accept that it's simply the end of the line.  To be fair, it's a hard decision to not accept what seems to be a life extending treatment. And it's incredibly hard as a physician to refuse dialysis to anyone, especially if the family wants it.<p>I also expect these same attitudes pervade u.s. trained physicians who may skirt these subjects of death more apprehensively because they also share those attitudes.  The cover your ass mentality also tends to mean people err on the side of doing more, when doing less may be more appropriate.",1290305395
