1923449,comment,1923019,1923019,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"My suspicion is that the ""killer app"" is an artifact of the super-balkanized era of computing, the era when every vendor's machines ran a different bespoke operating system. That was true in the mainframe era, and it was true <i>in spades</i> in the early PC era, when the IBM PC and the Mac and the Apple II and the Amiga and the C64 and several dozen vendor-specific flavors of Unix all coexisted, all with different OSes and radically different hardware.<p>Just from the evidence, it seems clear that porting software is still hard, but nowhere near as hard as it used to be. There's been some convergence in hardware and operating systems. The rate of turnover in these things has slowed way down. But perhaps the biggest reason is that our hardware and the abstractions built on top of it are now so powerful that large classes of apps -- the ones that don't push the limits of the hardware -- have become trivial to port. The term ""killer app"" was invented around the time of Visicalc; Visicalc was written in highly tuned assembly language so that it would fit in 20K of RAM (no, that is not a typo!):<p><a href=""http://www.frankston.com/public/?name=ImplementingVisiCalc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frankston.com/public/?name=ImplementingVisiCalc</a><p>Nowadays you can implement Visicalc in Javascript and run it on any platform with a customer base larger than five, while routinely creating temporary variables that are ten times the size of Visicalc's entire codebase.<p>So the modern strategy is to test your software on one platform, and then if it takes off port it to the others. So why don't more people start on Android and port to iOS, rather than vice versa? Maybe it's the vaunted fragmentation problem, but I'd guess that it's mostly because iOS is where the money is. There's an app distribution model and a store. That makes it easier to iterate there. Release the app on iOS and see if it floats or sinks. Then spend your Android-porting energy -- figuring out an ad-based model, testing on many different devices, marketing to all those Android users who don't know what ""Android"" means -- on the winners.<p>There are other potential sources of killer-app lock-in. Hardware is one. People who want hardware keyboards can't choose iOS. But that market doesn't seem to have enough size for its killer apps to make news -- particularly because only a subset of Android phones have keyboards, and those keyboards are all different.<p>There's one very obvious Android killer app: Verizon. Not exclusive for much longer, though, if the rumor mill is accurate.",1290214635

You say you're burning 20K per month, that is one hell of an operating budget if you're basically two guys with almost no customers. You said you started a new campaign but results are trickling in slowly, which is normal. It will take time to build a brand and a customer base. Banking on revenue being ""just around the corner"" is likely to get you into trouble. You're only allowed to give a concrete time frame for profitability if you already have a graph with a growth curve on it that will cross the red line with a decent amount of confidence at a predetermined point in the future. If you're pretty much at zero revenue right now, you cannot draw this line because you don't know the growth factor yet.

In your place I'd probably look into these things:<p>Can the money drain be reduced to a fraction of what it is now? If that leads to a reduction in service quality, you need to ask yourself if the majority of the expense is actually going into the core offering that customers want from you? Can the scope of this thing be reduced somehow? What do customers actually need from you (concentrate on one core expectation if possible). Can you find money elsewhere, for example by making a business plan and presenting to a VC? Take a very critical look at your revenue expectations: are there any hard numbers you can work with and plan for? Can you partner up with a company in some form of mutually beneficial agreement, possibly reducing your expenses or at least to help you get in contact with a pre-existing customer base?",1290211984

You <i>will</i> have thoughts (lots of them at first), you <i>will</i> have moments when you're present and moments when you're not, you <i>will</i> have pretty crappy concentration at first.  Over time, you develop a very easy, effortless form of concentration that doesn't involve forcing anything.  Concentration isn't the goal, just a pleasant byproduct.<p>The benefits?  I feel much more centered and present, more relaxed, my mind is sharper.  My mood tends to be better.  To be sure, there are times when I'm cranky when I start and cranky when I finish -- we don't get to use it to force our experience to change.  But by practicing being gently present, practicing accepting ""this is what my experience is right now,"" I seem to have more pleasant moods and fewer, briefer unpleasant moods.",1290211406

Apple undeniably is brilliant at marketing their products and got developers wildly enthusiastic about them - normal laws of ""physics"" just don't apply to Apple in this space.   For Android reality applies and this looks pretty much like a normal developer adoption curve for a platform to me.",1290211375

New tools can help you be more productive and even spend more time doing the design work that you love.<p>I also understand that as a designer (or any other consultants) you want customers that are easy to work, pay you well and on time. It is your right to choose you customers. It is also their right to choose you.",1290211335

Adobe's own version cue server (which they annoyingly discontinued) is pretty usable as well.<p>Hopefully the Adobe Drive stuff they've recently rolled out will end up integrated into one of the big (D)VCS's, so we can finally start managing digital assets as easily as code.<p>I don't think that you're ever going to get the dev community to force format changes on Adobe, because the chances or someone really building a solid competitor that you'd need to pass files back and forth from are so low.",1290211297
