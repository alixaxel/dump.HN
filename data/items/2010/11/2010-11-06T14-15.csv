Of course if they can they'll be happy to take it like for the mp3 players market. At the moment, looking at the numbers, Android is eating market share mostly from Apple's other competitors. Remember, this is not a race to be the company who makes the most money, it's just about making tons of money, and this is what Apple cares about. Look at the computer marktet, they don't care in selling more pc than Dell, they care of making a boatload of profit, even with their 7%.",1289055551

Then again, having had gadgets with one flaw that annoyed the crap out of me, I'm driven back to research. (For example, a DVD player that suddenly decided that 1) a parental controls limit had been set and needed a password to override (0000 worked fine), and 2) EVERY movie was above that limit, including Lady and the Tramp, which is a children's movie from the 50s for goodness' sake.)",1289055512

1876978,comment,1875172,1875652,0,0,rfrey,,,"I have no trouble with the scientific method, in fact I'm a science fanboy. I do maintain some discomfort with your <edit: my interpretation of your> stance though.<p>I hope my first point doesn't come across as nitpicking - it's not meant to. I bring it up because it seems to be the <i>primary way that people who think they understand science, but don't, perceive science.</i>  It is that you seem to value things that can be <i>proven true</i>.  Nothing in science can be proven true - that's why it's so uncomfortable to so many people, and in fact is why the scientific method was such an epistemological break from the past.  All we can do is <i>disprove</i> things.   My problem with holistic medicine or chakras or chi isn't that dissection hasn't found evidence.  It's that the theory/model/worldview <i>isn't formulated in a way that can be falsified</i> and therefore the the views have no meaning in a scientific context.<p>Note that I didn't say they were <i>false</i> from a scientist's view.  They simply aren't meaningful - they're content free.  A scientist wouldn't actually say they're true or false: a scientist would say that science has nothing to say about them.<p>The second issue I have with your position is related to the first point but slightly different: I think it's incorrect to label as false models that have no evidence.  For example, say a holistic medicine practitioner relents and formulates one of his practices in a falsifiable way. Tests are done and no beneficial effect is shown. I think the appropriate response is that the model is <i>unlikely to be true</i>, not that the model is false.  We simply haven't disproved the null hypothesis yet - that's not to say it won't or can't be done.  The scientific method just adds 9s to the certainty.  It is never certain.<p>In short, a scientist is profoundly and radically humble.",1289055370

This portion of the paper is always up for further debate (hence the title 'discussion').<p>So, given some operational definition of 'persons', a statement like, ""The scientific research ... suggests that dolphins are non-human persons..."" may not be entirely out of order in a scientific paper. If dolphins are persons, it's not a big jump to say that they qualify as individuals worthy of moral consideration.<p>Now, whether their operational definition of person is good or not is a question up for debate. Science has debated the meaning and use of many terms and ideas throughout history. Questions about the relation of the planets and stars used to be primarily theological (harmony of the spheres and so on). Some of our most famous scientists worked to develop good tests and supporting mathematics which slowly created the science of astronomy. That process has been repeated for many, many things over history. Personhood may be another one of those debates, one which we have the opportunity to witness in these sorts of studies.<p>So, provided the philosophical statements were properly positioned in the paper, I don't think they were entirely misplaced.

But I hesitate to count intel out - they've been around the disruption cycle a few times (having invented the microprocessor and integrated circuit).",1289052095
