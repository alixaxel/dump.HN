That's the reason that any setting, no matter how fantastic (D&D, 40k, HHGTTG) still has (something that acts and thinks like) modern-day humans.

With all the upcoming features, it'll be interesting to see what amateur & indie game developers without the capital of hundreds of thousands of dollars will be able to do, especially in the living room (via set top boxes + 3D/gamepad support) where barriers to entry to X-Box Live Arcade, Playstation Network & Wii Ware are very high.<p>Add to this that mobile is the current big push, so all of these are coming to your mobile web browsers and you won't have to always download and keep updating and reinstalling standalone native apps to be able to experience these things.<p>Do you also know how hard it is to port across platforms if you're an indie? With Flash/AIR, you can now deploy simultaneously to Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iPhone/ iTouch/iPad (via Flash iOS Packager) & Blackberry Tab (and soon, Windows Mobile 7 + Meego) with minimal porting effort. Sure, native is still optimal in terms of performance & capabilities, but for content creators with limited resources, this is a godsend.",1289615139
