I don't know for sure that he never photographed a cat lapping, but I can't imagine that the typical cat was happy to sit around drinking when strobes were going off and a high-speed film spool was cranking nearby.

The only problem with this is that it's extremely evil (because even non-users of Facebook can be fucked by this, thanks to the ""steal all of your email addresses"" import method), and that there aren't very many banks and insurance companies.<p>Another model I see is using the photo service and the photo graph to help the police solve cold cases.  Match the artist's sketch to the Facebook photo database, find some matches, and talk to their friends.  Also very scary and evil, but potentially profitable.

No matter if you want to create a company or just team up\nwith someone to develop a simple idea just for fun, it is just not that easy to find a partner. What do people do to solve this problem?<p>They seek among their friends or coworkers, they visit conferences (if their companies are ready to spend ~$1000 for a ticket),\nor they hang out on IRC and tech blogs. These methods are certainly not bad, but are they in tune with the present times? Look at job sites,\nor, excuse me, dating services.  Nowadays no one gives you advice to go seek a girlfriend in a library or a club. You go online and search\nthrough huge databases, see pictures, read profiles and have a chat before an actual meeting. This widens your choice and makes you life   \neasier and happier. So why don't we make such a solution for ourselves, in order to find people to create companies or projects with? \nI know we all are skeptics and each of you will name me thousands of reasons why it won't work out but why not give it a try\nif it works great in other fields? I'm not saying that it will replace real communication and visiting real tech events, but it will probably help.<p>What solutions exist today:<p>In fact, there are some solutions already. For instance, http://techcofounder.com and https://spreadsheets.google.com. \nI tried to use techcofounder.com and it seems to work well. You can create a profile  and receive some interesting proposition letters.\nAlas, it is still inconvenient to use: hard to browse, no search, no history of conversations. Same thing with spreadsheets.google.com,\nalthough amazingly simple, it is very difficult to browse.<p>So what have I done:<p>I've created a simple tool: http://yafounder.com. It is not another pretentious game-changing startup,\nI've just created it by myself and the idea was to try to find a simple solution for a problem and see if people like it.<p>What it does:<p>It allows you to search through  profiles in the same fashion as you do on dating websites. Just choose who you are and who you are looking for. \nYou can add some criteria such as location or skills. There are also message system, microblogs (funny, huh?) and an ideas list where you can discuss different startup ideas.<p>What it lacks is obviously users and I would be insanely grateful if some of you will register and give feedback.",1289529706

Yes, 3-4 years of battling 'tough market conditions' may lead a board to get rid of a CEO, but they'll have pocketed millions during a decline, whereas the declining period is often marked by layoffs of people who were implementing the dumb decisions made by the CEO and board members.<p>So, true, the 'market' will decide, but the CEOs don't really feel the impact of the market's decisions quite as much as most workers do.<p>I don't know much of Bartz's particular situation or pay structure, so I can't comment on her.",1289527578
