You can't please everybody, and we can just try to make sure that the vast majority of readers finds a piece useful and/or interesting. We try to do our best to keep the high quality level, and the amount of editing work for every single article hopefully speaks to that.<p>I understand what you are saying regarding the color difference in the examples, and it would be more correct to keep the background color the same, but I truly do not think that it would change the choice of typefaces a lot. We have carefully considered the typefaces and how they work together regardless the background they are on.<p>Also, I found quite many useful practical tips in the article, which is why it was published in the first place. But I can see that some descriptions are more general and could (and should) be more precise and concise. I will certainly keep your remark in mind for the next articles.",1288947573

Depending on which feature or gene sequence you're studying, and what method you use to construct a tree, you'll get slightly different trees.  Sometimes this is just statistical noise, but other times it's due to different traits actually having different lineages, as a result of events like recombination (say, when a virus injects a fragment of DNA into another creature's genome) or horizontal gene transfer [0].  If you build a phylogenetic tree that covers whole genomes for multiple species, it will typically end up being a phylogenetic network [1] rather than a simple tree.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_gene_transfer</a>

The questions of importance to me are:<p>Is it possible to sufficiently geo-engineer the Earth's climate to counteract climate change?<p>If it is possible where's the cost/benefit analysis (i.e. how much do we spend on geo-engineering to achieve the best 'payoff' in terms of success)?<p>What's the cost of adaptation (i.e. accepting that the change will happen and adapting ourselves to the changing environment)?<p>Those questions are relevant regardless of whether or not the world is getting hotter or colder.

It's become a religion, but unless you're a climate scientist (and I'm not) you realistically only know what you've consumed from others, and there's a lot of people on all sides who are more interested in moulding facts to fit a political argument than identifying what's really happened.",1288946429

You're being abrasive, defensive and confrontational in your comment responses. This is partly why you're getting downvoted and you're not being taken seriously. It's difficult to take someone seriously when the help being given (in some cases from people who've done a lot more than you have) is being flung back in their face.<p>2. Nobody knows whether your idea would work or not, but your execution needs a lot of work. Have you researched the market? What's the market for a list of downloadable videos? How will you monetise? What separates you from other torrent or video list sites? How will you stop the MPAA from shutting you down? Why is it that when I go to the front page I get a blog and not the top videos? Why should I stump up money to support this?<p>Now for number 2, instead of being defensive (and I can tell you're angry about your YC rejection, but it's not all of us that are trying to help you that rejected you) look to answer those questions. You need to work out not just if this is viable but how viable this is and what type of return an investor should expect based on investing X (where X is a range of different amounts of cash that you need) and how that money will be spent.<p>You have what appears to be an MVP, I'd suggest you work on pitching for investment in order to grow traffic and improve usability and organic SEO.<p>You need to go out and find investors, they're not going to come to you.

Well, do you want a very reliable car that you never have to do maintenance on, do you want a really fast car you can race, do you want some sort of luxury or prestige?<p>There's a few different goals you could have with martial arts: Fitness/athleticism, competition/camaraderie/sport, philosophy/balance, and/or practical self defense. Of the last one, there's also a few considerations. A highly trained martial artist in any art is going to fight very well, but how long do you intend to train and when if ever do you think you'd need to be proficient?<p>For me, I don't care about the sport aspect, the fitness aspect, the competition aspect, or the philosophy aspect. I sometimes travel through dangerous places, and I needed training that would get me proficient to protect myself in a variety of common situations. I researched into this some, and if you want rapid proficiency at self defense - to the exclusion of the other elements I mentioned - then I'd recommend a martial art that's been refined and taught by a successful military.<p>The two that I was deciding between to learn first are Krav Maga, the Israeli Army's martial art, and Systema, the Russian one.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_maga"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krav_maga</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systema</a><p>I was in Los Angeles which has the flagship American Krav studio, so I studied there and enjoyed it a lot, and I feel capable of defending myself in a variety of situations after only a few months of training.
