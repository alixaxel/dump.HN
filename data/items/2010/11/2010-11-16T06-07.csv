Take, for example, American car companies which do brisk business in China. The brands are popular and American, but the cars themselves are all Made in China. China wins, American corporations win, only the American people lose.<p>China is engaging in naked mercantilism, artificially depressing their currency to maintain a trade surplus, enacting tariffs  and other protectionist measures to limit imports and foreign access to domestic markets, and trying to secure a monopoly on natural resources with the aim of waging economic warfare against other nations, as they demonstrated recently with their decision to halt exports of rare-earth minerals to Japan over a minor territorial dispute.<p>This is far worse even than what we've come to expect from our supposed allies in Europe who routinely slap 15+% VATs on our exports and selectively enforce regulations to target mergers and acquisitions by American companies.<p>I hope the policy makers who kept telling us that China would liberalize and become a responsible power as it developed are satisfied with the situation they helped to create.

The issue is trying to protect people from themselves.  By protecting them from themselves, you are also protecting <i>your</i>self. I posit that the vast majority of Facebook users fall into the following categories:<p>1) They joined to use Facebook as a social networking tool, and they are so used to a multitude of things on the internet being free, that they never bothered to question how Facebook is monetized. They personally don't derive any value from their personal, private information, so they don't have any inkling that Facebook could have any interest in that information.<p>2) They joined Facebook, and they know that Facebook has their private information, but they don't care. Their attitude is: ""What's the worst that could happen?"" They will only be convinced that something bad could come out of Facebook's data mining of their information when either: 1) something happens to them or 2) something happens to someone else and is high-profile enough for them to believe that it happen (while not being obscure or enough for them to think, ""Well, they deserved it.)<p>3) They don't necessarily <i>want</i> to be on Facebook, but all (or most) of their friends are and they miss out on things like invitations to events, as well as 'inside' discussions if they aren't on Facebook. They attempt to try and limit the private information that they put onto Facebook, and to limit who can see the information they <i>do</i> put on Facebook, but sometimes they get lost in the maze of config options for privacy settings that are hidden here and there (scattered about, rather than gathered into one place).",1289890328

Very unlikely.  Google required a bit more than creativity.  It required great hacking and also knowledge of the complexity in information retrieval problems which you didn't get back then with online lectures (what lectures?) on dial-up, etc.<p>Meanwhile, Facebook as great as a company that it is, mostly borrowed ideas and tweaked them a bit with ""exclusivity,"" a clean design, etc.  Not saying that isn't admirable, but yes, it doesn't require graduate level work, just creativity and a lot of hard work to get jumpstarted.  And I bet Zuckerberg didn't start hiring high school dropouts/grads to help him scale his site, etc.  Surely there were a few, but I doubt they accounted for many.<p>So if you want to build the next Facebook, you better be hard-working, smart, and creative.<p>If you want to build the next Google, you better be that and learn about the next challenges in machine learning, information retrieval, data parallelism, etc. And that more than likely requires that you learn it from the experts--ie, more than likely not your average college/high school dropout.",1289888769
1909282,comment,1909225,1909225,0,0,dayjah,,,"So far I have started a total of three companies with non technical co-founders / aka ""biz person"". I definitely recommend it. Start ups are really a great example of where anyone brings something unique and helpful to the table... as long as their great people you should be good to go.<p>My three golden rules for the biz person:<p>- do not get wrapped up in ""there isn't tech, so I can't sell"". I had my current co-founder develop our application while I was busy building it, she found a great tool that turns power point presentations into an iphone app and was able to demonstrate the application without me<p>- focus on knowing the space, and provide a reading list with notes to the co-founder focused on building the product. Investors, particularly at an early stage, are looking for co-founders that are knowledgable in the space, focused on doing the right thing, driven. That is, most investments are the founders, not the product. So two founders that know the space well comes across as a very strong co-founding team.<p>- consider everything a race - can your co-founder build the product before you get traction on your side? I bet the answer is no, but once the requests start coming in for tweaks, etc, you'll find that you do not have any idea on what you should be doing now - this, in my experience, is primarily as result of failing the first rule. If you treat your biz processes the same as dev tasks and keep moving forwards fast you'll yield better steps.<p>and a fourth...<p>- know your analytics inside out, get in place all of these parts. ""We need a mixpanel event at this point and this point of the application"" - etc.<p>Now, I noticed you aid ""business guy"" and not ""non-tech co-founder"". Early stage employees can be as important as co-founders, so take these rules and dilute them to taste... and remember you're a <i>critical</i> part of this effort.",1289888759
