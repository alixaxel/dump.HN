But Yahoo did the trick by providing open source implementations of these technologies. By providing them as open-source(may be first open-source product from yahoo),hadoop has quickly grown to what it is now in a very short span of time. Currently, almost all the big players in the web market are adopting these technologies for their use and, at the same time, contributing to these technologies. Facebook and twitter, both are now dependent on these tools.
I know that internally Google may be far too ahead than the current distributed computing technologies available in the market.

People care about the software you write and use it in their daily lives.<p>2.) You get social cachet from working there.  Say ""I work for Google"", and a bunch of people will say, ""Oh, that must be nice.  I wish I was smart enough to get in there.""  Outside of a few nerds who are too cool for FaceBook, saying ""I work for FaceBook"" gets the same reaction.<p>3.) Being in a younger, game-changing company gives you the chance to work on cooler, game-changing technologies.  Many tech workers are attracted by hard problems; young, fast-growing companies tend to have lots of hard problems.<p>4.) When companies are younger, they've accumulated less legacy code and fewer bureaucratic procedures.  If you ask a bunch of Googlers what they hate most about working for Google, I bet a large portion will say ""legacy code"".  This is a maintenance tax that isn't fun at all, yet has to be dealt with whenever you build something on top of it.  Being younger and smaller, FaceBook has less of this.",1290142819
