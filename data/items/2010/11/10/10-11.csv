Even if you treat the problem as a thought experiment, it feels uncomfortable because:<p>- Ball bouncing with 60% energy remaining all the time is actually a premise, a rule, because we are not supposed to consider atoms or their interactions. There is no reason to it, it becomes a fact.<p>- Ball is a singular object. We don't have atoms, so we don't have to think things like ""What happens when the height of the bounce gets shorter than the size of the atom?"" The concept of the ball becomes a premise.<p>- We get a picture that shows the balls losing speed in direction x at each bounce, but since the question asks for us to judge ""qualitatively"", we will omit that. We cannot have observations for this problem, it is not the real world.<p>- There is no friction, or spin, so vertical speed cannot be transfered into horizontal speed and vice versa.<p>- The concept of bounce might be different, this question probably assumes it happens at 0 (instant) time without deforming the ball, since remember our ball is singular.<p>- The rest we can probably treat with Newtonian physics in Euclidean geometry, no air, interaction between ball and surface frictionless, etc.<p>But it feels uncomfortable, because I too can make up an imaginary world for myself, dress it like the real world and ask my question and hide the premises behind.",1289386167

1889862,comment,1889720,1889720,0,0,Robin_Message,,,"EDIT: TL;DR: I see the primary problem with recruitment being far too many applicants for each job, because applicants apply to many, many jobs. Incentivise applying to only a few jobs and the employer gets fewer, better applicants.<p>For job-seekers, the marginal cost of one more application is too low, so companies get too many applications. With too many applicants, filtering becomes more random, so the reward for applying for a job you are only tenuously qualified for increases. It's a classic hawks vs doves with a big payoff for being a hawk amongst mostly doves<p>So, make it more expensive to apply for a job. Two ways I can think of doing this:<p>1. Charge applicants ten bucks to apply for a job. Have companies report if they were good enough but they found someone better. In that case, give them a refund. In all other cases, keep the money. (EDIT: This may possibly be illegal in some jurisdictions, but there are doubtless ways around that.)<p>2. Show companies how many jobs the applicant has applied for recently (not necessarily where they have applied, but you could perhaps positions/business areas) and/or restrict applicants to N applications per month. Aggressively detect and ban sock-puppetting — perhaps you can require verified ID of the applicant's name and get companies to check that is the name of the person applying.<p>You could also make things less stressful by operating on a say weekly or monthly cycle. Jobs are posted at the beginning of the month, applicants choose which N jobs they want to apply for, applications go out, new cycle starts. This avoids stampedes and requires applicants to be discerning.",1289386005

I'm more interested in the fact that the vast majority of Gruber-style pronouncements about how special Apple is require you to not have any knowledge of what's actually happening outside the Apple bubble.<p>It's also worth noting that the Samsung Galaxy Tab price has been on a constant downward trajectory. Last I saw the Carphone Warehouse in the UK was selling it for £489 for 32GB (compared with $599 for iPad 32GB) a £110 difference rather than the $30 dollar one Gruber quotes.

Only then will Apple operate on a level playing field with regards to other hardware manufacturers, as it is the advantage of the market that enables them to subsidise the price of hardware, and as they have grown dominant in hardware (especially in music players) they should be treated as a monopoly of that market and competition encouraged (by just levelling that playing field slightly).<p>I realise that these views aren't in line with the opinion of the vast majority of people I speak to, especially online and in circles who use Apple gear.

Also, adopted children tended to have lower standardized test scores than their non-adopted peers. Factors that are not important in determining high standardized test scores in children include: the family is intact, the parents recently moved to a better neighborhood, the mother didn't work between birth and kindergarten, the child attended Head Start (US government program providing education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families), the parents regularly take the child to museums, the child is regularly spanked, the child frequently watches television, the parents read to the child nearly every day. Noting the overgeneralization, Levitt explains that what is important in parenting is who you are, not what you do.""<p><a href=""http://www.wikisummaries.org/Freakonomics:_A_Rogue_Economist_Explores_the_Hidden_Side_of_Everything"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wikisummaries.org/Freakonomics:_A_Rogue_Economist...</a>",1289383734

I know a bunch of people a few years older than myself who would like to settle down and start a family now, but can't because they spent their 20s either unemployed, in a variety of clerical jobs, or in organizations (eg. school systems) that are chronically underfunded and overworked.  They don't have either the money <i>or</i> time to start a family without falling a rung down the socioeconomic ladder - let along work on cool stuff.<p>A lot of popular blogs (eg. Marc Andreesen's) divide up your career into phases, where you optimize for different things in each phase.  Your 20s is usually the ""development"" phase, where people hire you for what you can do in the future.  Your 30s is the ""harvest"" phase, where people hire or acquire you (at substantially increased rates) for what you've done in the past.  You want to optimize for skills & experience during the development phase, because otherwise, there's no reason for anyone to hire you during the harvest phase.",1289383318
