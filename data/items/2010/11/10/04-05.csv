Etc.<p>The truth is, all else being equal, salary is an important factor when deciding between offers and the only one that is easily comparable (i.e. if you have an offer from few good companies, like Amazon or Google or Apple, you will only know if you're compatible with the company/team/particular job you landed after you have worked there for a while but salary is a known quantity upfront hence it might tip the scale in favor of the company offering the highest salary).<p>Which is why offering above average salary is a good hiring strategy for any company, including Google.<p>I can't think of a reason why a single current Google employee should be displeased with such a raise.",1289365110

1889212,comment,1888843,1889043,0,0,jmilloy,,,"Right. The argument is that we force ourselves into monophasic sleep, which is unnatural and inefficient.<p>""Why We Nap"" (ISBN 0817634622) is a great resource about polyphasic sleep. Most of us are in the habit of monophasic sleep, even if we have crazy or limited sleep schedules. The thing is, if your body goes through more than one sleep cycle in a period of sleep, then there is a period in the middle where you are basically not getting anything from the sleep. Biphasic sleeping is a way to reset the cycle more quickly, so instead of 2 hours of low value sleep, you just wake up for a half hour or so.<p>Personally, I've found that another important thing is simply sleeping consistently. That means either certain times of the day or for certain amounts of time. For example, always sleeping in three hours means your body knows what to expect and makes the most out of the time. Biphasic is just the easiest (and perhaps most natural) way to do it.",1289364551

Dvorak is pretty established as <i>the</i> alternative English-language keyboard layout - It's not hard to set up on Windows, Unix, or (I'm guessing) OS X. Is Colemak? While I'm convinced that Dvorak is <i>significantly</i> better than Qwerty, if you're the stubborn sort that would use a different keyboard layout for English (spoiler alert: I am), I suspect there's diminishing returns after that. Still, I'm really curious about Colemak (what was the rationale?) - I just don't know anybody who uses it.<p>My strategy of ""heavily customized Emacs / Dvorak on my computers, standard Qwerty / vi otherwise"" has been a good compromise over the years, incidentally.<p>Also, I work with Swedish hackers who remind me that Qwerty is only ""standard"" so far across the ocean.
