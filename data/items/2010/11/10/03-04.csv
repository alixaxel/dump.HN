The point is, it's not the same.<p>Last time I had a forum argument with a guy who said he could build me a Mac Pro equivalent Dell for half the price. I went to Dell's website - no way. Best I could do was something like $50 less on a $3000 machine. So I dared him to prove it, and he came up with a machine that was worse in every way (oh we don't need a Xenon CPU, let's just go with a C2D... and things like that) and cost half as much. Total joke.<p>Your laptop that costs half as much - show us a link to the full specs page. This is the internet - prove it.",1289361419

I once wrote an application at a big company, which had a strict application packaging process, for remotely installing apps on machines.  A last minute change was requested, which resulted in a small error being made in the 'tab order' of the screen.  It would have taken one compile and 20 seconds to fix, but because the rules said the executable couldn't be updated once packaged, it remained so.  7 years down the track, the same application was still being used, and the users of said app had to skip using the tab key to get around fields and instead mouse backwards.  7 years of aggravation and frustration on the part of users which could have been avoided with 20 seconds worth of rule breaking.  I'm aware of what those rules are for, but having a structure so fixed that it causes this type of inefficiency is frustrating to all involved.

1888981,comment,1887607,1888629,0,0,icey,,,"That's a pretty fair question. In my opinion, the only reason to go with ASP.NET anything is if you already know C# (or any other .Net language).<p>Otherwise, Rails, Django, Flask, Cake, etc are going to be significantly easier to get up to speed with, have better communities, have less murky IP situations and are generally going to be less expensive to develop for and to hire developers for.<p>There are advantages to the CLR world - Tooling is top notch (Mono's tools are lacking right now but seem to be improving quickly), there is a reasonable amount of documentation, even though some of it is of questionable quality. C# performs well, both on Mono and .Net. There are many libraries available (although the quality of the libraries can sometimes be lacking). Many of the higher quality libraries are closed-source commercial libraries. Some of the worst ones are also closed-source commercial packages, so it pays to do research prior to purchasing anything.<p>The community has been warming to open source - in my opinion this is largely due to the efforts of Miguel de Icaza and everyone working on the Mono Project. (As an aside, if you don't like asp but you do like C#, you should consider checking out and contributing to Manos de Mono, a Mono based web framework which is still in its infancy - <a href=""https://github.com/jacksonh/manos"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jacksonh/manos</a> .)<p>Microsoft is, and always will be a for-profit company that makes money from selling its software. It has a vested interest in creating platform lock-in, but developers don't have to stick to the Microsoft way of doing things if they choose not to, thanks to the strength of Mono today. Either way, Microsoft is pretty up-front about what the cost of doing business is with them; and they have proven to be pretty consistent with their pricing.<p>Politics and profits aside, C# is an enjoyable language to use. I haven't spent time with F# yet, but I understand it's quite enjoyable as well. The C# team has done an excellent job of paying attention to programming trends and adopting techniques from other languages. The transition from 1.1 to 2.0 was kind of clunky, but since then they've shown a great deal of good taste in what they've implemented as well as how it's been implemented. Of course, the downside is that C# is a large and complex language. I think the most recent ""C# in Nutshell"" book is well over a thousand pages.<p>I have production code deployed in Python, PHP and Clojure, but I'm currently migrating back to .Net for my personal projects.  C# developers get an excellent cross-platform deployment story thanks to Mono (MonoTouch, MonoDroid, MonoMac). Honestly, I think Mono runs on pretty much everything from PC, Mac & Linux to WP7, iPhone and Android; as well as game consoles, embedded hardware, etc.<p>Additionally, many of the new to .Net technologies coming out of Microsoft right now such as F#, C# 5's async framework, MVC3 and Entity Framework 4 are very compelling. Microsoft is kind of a dorky company, but in my opinion they are producing pretty good software right now.",1289358707

My issue is that people seem to have the assumption that becoming great at something is about following some set of steps that can be explained: read this book, take this class, or drink this magic potion.<p>Instead, the reason people I know are great at the things they are great at is because that's all they do: when they wake up in the morning the first thing that pops into their mind is to grab their computer or violin, head to the library or laboratory, and be ""doing something"".<p>These people don't often have much else in common: their methods may even look like madness, with atypical technique permeating their self-taught landscape of awesome. There was not this ""moment of hesitation"" before they jumped in to do something.<p>And to me, nothing demonstrates this ""moment of hesitation"" better than someone who isn't doing something because they feel they aren't ready yet. I've seen people sit around for years, somehow operating under the principal that eventually the magic potion will appear, they'll drink it, and be great.<p>My contention is that these people will not become great. Now, I /don't/ believe this is incurable, but I believe that it requires someone really passionate about what they do to try to explore that passion with them: to help break down those walls that are keeping someone from ""already"" being great.<p>However, even more often, I think these people are in the wrong field, and here is where I believe ""be passionate"" goes from platitude to ""advice"": it is the advise to do something else that you are /actually/ passionate about instead of the thing you are currently sitting around talking about.<p>So, if you are currently languishing trying to build a company: you don't see how other people can spend the time they are doing, you can't bring yourself to occasionally make a fool out of yourself in a negotiation... you simply consider the thing ""work"" as opposed to ""the most important thing to be done when you wake up in the morning"", you are starting the wrong company.<p>This might involve choosing a different area, one you really believe in, but it may also just involve removing road blocks, whether they be external or internal, from the problem so you can relax: maybe you need an assistant, someone who has a passion for organization, to help you out with things you find boring.<p>Here is where you may then say: ""so the real advise is get an assistant; saying be passionate is just some weird cop out"". No: being passionate was the only concrete advise; it is the core belief you can use to rapidly take your issue and convert it into an action item. You start with ""be passionate"", identify why you aren't, and then solve it.<p>Now, the stupidest part of this is that I actually ""agree"" with this article, but I still think the author totally missed the point: I'd say this is the checklist used when you /are/ passionate about something to determine ""is this a business"".<p>Just because you are passionate about something does not mean you will (or even can) make money doing it. As wccrawford says, if you aren't putting your all into it, you are all the more likely to fail, and the thing that is going to allow you to put your all into it, day after day after painful horrible day, is ""passion"".",1289358405
