They're different services; GMail does not have third-party apps in the same sense. Facebook's app ecosystem has some quite disreputable parties in it; an API that lets these parties have access to friends' email addresses would place a lot of Facebook users' emails in the hands of companies that they have no direct relationship with or knowledge of.",1289372356

I know that one of the reasons I value the communities I'm a part of is for what you just demonstrated. As Mike would say, ""I am but an egg"" and I need the others in the community to point out where I have an opportunity for growth and explain why. I definitely appreciate the gnu.org link.<p>I guess where I disagree with all of this is in my implementation. I choose to provide services (as a consultant) rather than goods (in the form of modules or themes). I can't disagree with the result though, as the end is often the same.<p>Sorry for my attack on the thread; I suppose what I really wanted to do was ask a question and I didn't know how.

The question is whether GOOG will be higher or lower next year.<p>2) Options and equity that Facebook gives its employees aren't free. They have a market value, which Facebook is giving in return for an employee's efforts.<p>The real issue is that Google has more than 10x as many employees as Facebook, and its value is likely to be more volatile, which is good for risk-seeking employees.<p>Edit: Both Google has about 10x the Market Cap and 10x the employees, so they're at least in the same order of magnitude in terms of how much equity can be given away in each.",1289369491
1889386,comment,1887442,1889345,0,0,cdavid,,,"Indeed. I have read that parsing is the slowest part of compilation several times, but I guess this is very dated. For example, compiling numpy (a python package with ~ 100 kLOC of C code):<p><pre><code>  - CFLAGS=""-O0"" -> ~ 20 sec\n  - CFLAGS=""-O1"" -> ~ 35 sec\n  - CFLAGS=""-O3"" -> ~ 60 sec\n</code></pre>\nSince the amount of parsed code for those modes is approximately the same (for numpy it is exactly the same, but one could imagine differences in glibc headers, etc...), this shows that parsing is not the bottleneck anymore if you build non-debug builds.",1289369411
