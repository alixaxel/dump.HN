""Same story submitted three days ago and ignored"", with a link to their own submission.<p>My reply:
One of the benefits of relying on crowdsourcing for quality judgements (i.e. using people to determine what content goes on your site), is that by and large the system takes care of itself - good stuff generally floats upwards and bad stuff generally floats downwards. The advantage of this is that the system can respond to current events much <i>much</i> more quickly than any kind of curated medium. Many stories are 'broken' in places like hackernews and reddit long before mainstream media catch the story.<p>One of the downsides is that the system does have a fair dose of randomness. A story with 50 votes is not necessarily worth half a story with 100 votes. Likewise, some stories will get missed - perhaps the right people weren't looking at the new queue when it was submitted, or perhaps another high-profile story was taking up people's attention.<p>This is the tradeoff you make; increased reaction time for reduced recall. I.e. hackernews and sites like it feature fresher content with the drawback that some stories don't make it.<p>Fortunately, this system takes care of the drawback by virtue of the fact that if an important story is somehow missed, the chances are it will be submitted again by a different user and have another chance to rise.<p>Which is exactly what happened here. The system works, it self-corrected the omission of this story. How cool is that!",1290079350

I have a related theory, though.<p>I've worked with several arrogant people that took under-performing operations and grew them into sizable profit centers. Their arrogance was an asset when in a fast change atmosphere where bullheaded determination and over confidence got things pushed through. They didn't always make the best decisions, but at least they were capable of making timely ones - and bend the will of others.<p>Once the rapid growth and improvement period was over, though, they never adjusted to sustaining mode. Their arrogance caused rifts in the organizations. Two were eventually let go.<p>So my amateur management theory is that highly arrogant people may be great for leading organizations in a period of rapid transition, but they are not typically the best leaders for mature organizations.",1290078938

Simply being a narcissist causes ""much damage""? It sounds like this article is coming from the POV of a manager having trouble controlling employees with a not-low-enough self-worth.<p>The only troubling thing to me about the finding is this article summarizing it. A good manager gets the most out of his employees by putting them in roles that maximize their abilities and take into account their personal traits.

I've seen the salary information be used by agencies to pitch someone fractionally above what they're currently on, and lower than we're prepared to pay, just to help ensure they get the placement and kick back. They're more concerned with getting placements at all rather than finding the right person for the job (and making me a happy client) or increasing their revenue per placed candidate.<p>I dislike this, it's not helping me find the best candidates, and it's not rewarding the best candidates accordingly (I want them to not have money as an issue so that they are not stressed at work about silly things outside of work... so I want to pay them more than they need to a point of comfort). In fact it closes career progression off from the candidate, as progression is usually paired with salary increase to acknowledge the maturity of experience and skills acquired.<p>As a result of this I flatly refuse to act on salary information and keep it out of the interview. I'm not interested in money and hope that the candidate isn't either... we'll pay well enough for it not to be a worry without paying too much that it is a burden too much for us. The rest of the game, other companies can play that.<p>I'm possibly naive.<p>[edit]If you're wondering, whilst I do entertain the process and do act on agency CVs, we've hired way more people directly (us finding them or them finding us) as the quality of the candidate is way higher. CVs are so bad at communicating passion, creative thinking, actual technical skill... even more so once an agency filters them.",1290078100
