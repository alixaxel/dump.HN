1867749,comment,1866486,1866990,0,0,dkarl,,,"Stereotypes that have a kernel of truth will always persist, and there will always be a kernel of truth to the stereotype of the socially maladjusted hacker.<p>Why?  Because hacking is relatively friendly ground to them.  They can excel, and they will be much less handicapped by their social shortcomings than they would be in other fields.<p>If you want to end the stereotype, you have to make computer programming equally unfriendly to the socially maladjusted, unshowered nerds.  That would be a loss.  Not only would programming lose valuable contributors, we would turn some number of those talented people into sorry, helpless losers who don't contribute anywhere.  And that's the endgame:  if every field vigilantly safeguards its social reputation against infiltration by potentially embarrassing nerds, then it will be impossible for nerds to contribute to society at all.  For various reasons, hacking is hospitable to nerds:  why not leave it that way?  If you're uncomfortable being associated with a field that is unusually accommodating of socially inept people, then leave hackerdom and join a field that does a better job of policing itself.  There are plenty of those fields, and not many safe havens for dorks.<p>[Edit:  I am praying that nobody starts a subthread on the semantics of ""nerd"" and ""dork.""  Please don't.  Just read my comment the way it makes most sense to you.]",1288846700

The nice thing about RoR is it kinda forces you to do a few 'best practices things' so even newbie developers tend to end up with 'ok' code.  Of course, there are many PHP frameworks that also apply this sort of way of coding.<p>Also, note that there will be a learning curve (probably small, but you will notice it) when you first start learning rails.  Like all new languages, you'll overcome this eventually.<p>There is really no reason to choose one or the other.  You basically already know the answer.  Whenever people ask me this question I say 'What do you think the pros/cons are for each language?' and then right after they list them I say 'ok, pick one'.  This is really not a subject worth dwelling on with established languages/frameworks.<p>PS: If it were me, I'd choose RoR :)",1288846629

1867733,comment,1866305,1866783,0,0,patio11,,,"<i>all I did was sum the infinite series</i><p>This is meant to sound very difficult (and might be, if you majored in journalism), but summing infinite geometric series is easy enough to do in your head if you're facile with fractions: (first_term) / (1 - step_multiplier).<p>Observe that, of the combined velocity of the fly and the bike approaching him, the fly always makes up 60%.  That makes math easier since it eliminates division and time from the problem entirely.<p>On the first trip, the fly travels 12 miles and the bike approaching him travels 8 miles.  There are now 4 (20 - 2 * 8) miles between the bikes.<p>On the second trip, the fly travels .6 * 4 = 2.4 miles and the bike approaching him travels 1.4 * 4 = 1.6 miles.  There are now 0.8 miles between the bikes.<p>The part where people who are really good with math distinguish themselves from people who are not is realizing quickly that the problem they are looking at, with flies and bikes, quickly decomposes into ""sum the series that starts 12, 2.4, etc"".<p>12 / (1 - 0.2) = 12 * 5 / 4 = 15 miles total fly travel.<p>You can do it a little more formally if you want to verify the intuition that each step takes 1/5th the time (covers 1/5th the distance) of the previous step.  (My intuition says ""In the time that it takes the fly to go 5 units, the two bikes will chew up 4 units of that distance, so he is only left with 1 unit to travel the next time."")",1288846237

If you want to test the waters, follow a few tutorials for each that you're unfamiliar with, and see what suits you better.<p>If you're using a shared server, you also have to make sure that your host supports RoR (most hosts don't). So that could be an extra expense to consider.<p>Me personally: I'm a php person.

1867710,comment,1867315,1867498,0,0,mikeyur,,,"Size: Vancouver is a ""big"" city (or at least tries to be), but it's still pretty small. Small in a good way though, the population is ~2m in the metro area but the city itself is ~600k. The downtown core is completely walkable. It's always more of a hassle to hop on the train for 2 stops than to just walk. Clean, can't recall ever seeing poop (human or animal) on the sidewalk.<p>Rent: for downtown living in the more expensive parts, you're probably looking at $1600-2500 cdn for a 2bdrm. Don't mind commuting 10-15 minutes on the train/by bus: $1000-1600 for a decent place. You can get a studio or 1 bdrm in the west end (downtown) for $800-1200, add a few hundred more if you're looking at coal harbour/yaletown.<p>Outdoors: Parks, everywhere - a couple large ones and tons of small ones (a couple soccer fields, running track, etc). You've got more ocean than you could ever ask for and a couple local mountains (~20-25 mins from downtown by driving, or take transit + gondola up grouse which will probably be an hour or so). And you're 1 hour from Whistler. Lakes and camping within an hour of the city. There's also Stanley Park right downtown. One of the biggest advantages seems to be that you can get outdoors and feel 'out of the city' within the city limits.<p>Entertainment: Hockey (NHL/WHL) and Canadian football. Same amount of large bands coming through here as any major US city, good small venues as well for some local bands and smaller acts.<p>Transit: The city has pretty decent transit and it's cheap. $2.50 for a transfer (last 1.5hrs) or ~$80 for a 1 month, unlimited 1 zone pass. There are 3 SkyTrain lines which will get you downtown pretty quickly from anywhere within Vancouver (15-18 mins max). Transit is pretty bus-oriented, but it's never really been a problem for me. Getting out of downtown might be a problem if you like to hang out past 2am and/or live in the sticks. Not much open 24 hours or really late other than a couple coffee shops and a handful of restaurants.<p>Biking: I don't bike but the city seems fairly bike friendly (and getting better), I believe we have 3 routes now with separated bike lanes downtown. You can bike safely from anywhere within Vancouver. My neighbour bikes to work every day from East Van which probably takes him 25-30 mins each way.<p>Tech Scene: It's alright, but we're working on it. I put together a startup hackathon last month and met a bunch of fellow Vancouver HN users. There are a couple startup incubators here and more coming (I believe), Bootup Labs seems to be the most well known. There are angels, VCs and the like here - but nowhere near the level of SF, NYC, Seattle.<p>Talent: 2 main schools with CS programs nearby (SFU and UBC), but talent seems hard to find - it's here, you just need to look. If you do find it, it can be fairly cheap though. Much much lower than the valley (from what friends have told me), there are no Facebook-like companies driving up salaries here. I'm probably going to get shanked at the next hacker meet up, but you can probably get decent people for $35k/yr (junior) to $70k/yr (senior/leads).<p>A big problem seems to be that you can count 'notable' startups on one hand. There are gaming companies here, both mobile/console and gambling. It's much more relaxed here and people just want to live life well. There are hardcore entrepreneurs and hackers here, but also a lot of wantrepreneurs and people who want to come in at 10, take an hour lunch and leave by 5. Very little of that 'startup culture' you hear so much about in San Francisco.<p>My opinion, but other Vancouverites feel free to criticize or add to this.",1288845440

With 1 queue and the long taking guy first (blocking 1 counter for 10 minutes) total processing time is 11 Minutes.<p>Another way to look at it is that with one queue, everyone gets the minimum possible wait time.  In the many queues case you get that only occasionally. You could optimize the many queues so they're just as efficient as the one single queue but you'd have to know everyone's processing time in advance - impossible in a real world setting.",1288845431

A quick search is giving me nothing to disagree with you.<p>That being said: My understanding was that the many-line system worked better primarily because of the potential for a lot of lost time between the server saying ""Can I help whose next"" and the order actually starting.  This time is obviously hugely dependent on factors such as floor layout, space around the registers, customers familiarity with the system, etc.  The idea was that if you have one line for multiple registers (a la Wendy's) than when the second register opened up the next customer in line had to notice, go to the register, probably walk around the person ordering at the first register, and then start ordering.  Whereas in the multi-line system (a la McDonald's) the next customer in line will likely be focusing on the register in front of them ready to take the one step forward when their time comes.  These factors can certainly be minimized but in stores that are busy/crowded/not well laid out it they can make a noticeable difference.  That's my $.02 anyways.",1288845402

Enjoy the idea of hobnobbing with exciting personalities like Steve Ballmer and Mark Hurd? Follow my simple guide and your country can also enjoy the limitless prosperity and social harmony with which the technology industry has blessed California!<p>First, you'll need a name. It has to start with the word 'Silicon', even if the only silicon that will be present comes stamped with the Intel logo. Next, choose a geographic feature. Unfortunately, the best geographic features have already been claimed. May I suggest ""Silicon Muskeg""?<p>Now, if you visit the actual Silicon Valley, you will see a lot of office buildings. Ample supply of office space is <i>the</i> reason Silicon Valley is a success. So, the first thing you're going to need is a nice big, empty space to build offices. Lots of them. Try to find an economically depressed area, far from the places educated workers live (cheap!) and miles from public transit. Make sure this area is zoned so that only large, expensive cubicle farms and parking lots will be built, as this is the most efficient use of space. No services are necessary, as the people working here can simply drive into the city if they require food or drink.<p>Also, it is vital that your new offices be supplied with fiber-optic Internet service. Rare and difficult as this may be to provide, Internet service is what separates your mind-bending city of the future from the primitive hovels your country's technology industry now inhabits.<p>No replica of Silicon Valley would be complete without tenants! And so, your final task is to fill these offices with the industries that define the dynamism and forward-thinking spirit of Silicon Valley: IBM, Microsoft, Intel, and Dell! Don't waste your time on small fry: Fortune 500 only, please. It matters not if your new offices are filled with call centers and rebate-processing facilities, because the very <i>soul</i> of technology will leach from the telephones and TPS reports, permeating the landscape with the pure essence of innovation.<p>So huzzah, dear bureaucrat, and godspeed!",1288844502

It's just a yelling match peppered with a lot of ad hominem attacks and the solution is always cap and trade.<p>The solution goes nowhere though because China and India tell us we caused the problem and so we must unilaterally cut our consumption of greenhouse gases.  Meanwhile Russia is building a big oil and gas network stretching into China totally outside the reach of the would be international climate regulators and cap and trade financial superstructure.  Besides, cap and trade is just a way to pay corrupt politicians in developing countries to shut down industry and impoverish their citizens and better yet, starve their citizens by tearing up all their farm land and building inedible ethanol crops.<p>The irony is that the left are the ones who are super-enthusiastic about enacting draconian climate change legislation which dramatically increases the cost of energy for those in the lower income bracket and seriously handicaps the development and improvement in living standards of any developing country foolish enough to go along with the already smugly developed world's agenda.<p>BTW, Technology Review has really become quite ideological lately and is much less of a science magazine then it used to be.",1288843569
