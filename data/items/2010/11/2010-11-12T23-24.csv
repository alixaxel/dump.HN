1899757,comment,1899582,1899582,0,0,dotBen,,,"I could write an essay on this subject, but here's a few thoughts:<p>Managed servers != no root access.  Most good managed server providers will give you root and their 'managed service' is to keep things patched, deal with issues that span your cluster, higher tier of support than just making sure the machine is booted and network is available to the device, etc.  Sure, there are some providers don't give you root, which brings me to...<p>Be very cautious of providers who don't offer root and want to do all your app deployments for you. If you subscribe to the ""devops"" concept then deployment is part of the development process and can't be thrown over the wall and given to someone else to do in isolation.  Also, agile methodologies are now enabling us to deploy once a week/day/many times a day rather than the more infrequent cycles enterprise software is used to.  These non-root folks are not going to handle a deployment for you on a daily basis.  To not give the customer root is to really not subscribe to these new ways of thinking and new ways of doing business.<p>I would ask why you want to go down the managed server route in the first place?  If you need help with your initial setup and deployment find someone in your network to help you on a consultancy basis.  Simple on-going server maintenance should be something most technical people can pick up, and if you get stuck go back to your consultant. You'll probably still be better off $$ given the cost savings of managed vs dedicated hardware.  Plus VPS and/or EC2 solutions might fit you better than 'bare metal' hardware solutions, but both are (usually) non-managed services.<p>The only managed services I do recommend is if you want to go down the Heroku route, which is excellent if it fits your technology stack and business.  But I don't think that is what you were referring to.",1289605939

Your argument of knowing the risk beforehand is irrelevant.

Say, the access time of the disk will be a function of the position on disk, so it would be unrealistic to get random delays when scanning a large chunk of contiguous data or by just having a few delays in a random-access heavy load would also be extremely unfair.<p>In short, trying to model complicated disk latencies is pretty hard, and usually if you are programming with some model of disk in mind, building a disk latency simulator under that same model may end up giving you a false sense of security.<p>For what it's worth, I'd favor getting a cheap hard disk and trying the load there instead.",1289605880

This has been well-known for a while. I present to you the TCP throughput equation:<p><a href=""http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3448.html#sec-3.1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3448.html#sec-3.1</a><p>The fundamental reason for this result is that the rate that TCP's congestion control algorithm increases the congestion window is tied to round trip time. Congestion window determines how many packets can be ""in the air"" at any given time, and starts from 1-3 packets in modern OS's.<p>Moreover, packet loss dramatically reduces TCP performance, and this can happen whenever traffic traverses a congested router along its path: once the router queue is full, packets get dropped, and your congestion window is cut in half and grows slowly afterwards. It might be surprising to some, but the effect of queueing delays can often dominate the effects of propagation delays due to the physical distance that a packet has to traverse.<p>I know this type of measurement study has been done numerous times; I'm blanking on more recent ones but I know for instance the Rocketfuel project [1] from 2002 did perform large-scale Internet measurements that included link latencies from various vantage points on the network.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/networking/rocketfuel/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.washington.edu/research/networking/rocketfuel/</a>",1289604762

Even while rejecting the machine-or-transformation test as an <i>exclusive</i> test for saying that a particular business method meets the test for patentable subject matter, the Supreme Court nonetheless upheld that test as a <i>useful indicator</i> of whether something was patentable or not. If, for example, a software patent failed to meet that test, then a court could potentially conclude that it did not constitute patentable subject matter. What then? In all likelihood, a court would say, as did the Supreme Court in <i>Bilski</i>, that the challenged patent fails as constituting only an abstract idea, which is not patentable.<p>Courts have more and more been using the <i>Bilski</i> precedent as authority to strike down software and business method patents on abstract-idea grounds. <i>Bilski</i> pointed the way and many courts are following. (See, e.g., <a href=""http://ipspotlight.com/2010/08/19/district-court-rules-internet-advertising-patent-invalid-under-bilski/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipspotlight.com/2010/08/19/district-court-rules-inter...</a>)<p>The Groklaw piece referred to in this article discusses this in more detail (see <a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20101111114933605"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20101111114933605</a>). Moreover, in an August 13, 2010 piece (<a href=""http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20100813112425821"" rel=""nofollow"">http://groklaw.net/article.php?story=20100813112425821</a>), Groklaw reported that ""Groklaw member Celtic_hackr went through [the Oracle software patents] and sees none that are tied to any specific machine.""<p>With its latest filing, Google is revealing its strategy as one of taking on Oracle's software patents head on and asking the court to declare them invalid on the abstract-idea ground (among others). This is very aggressive and has potentially huge consequences.<p>Bottom line: Oracle can go fishing for opportunistic dollars but it will do so against Google only at a potentially devastating cost to its newly-acquired Sun assets. In the precatory words of Groklaw (in the item last cited above): ""And may software patents crash into the ocean as an unintended consequence of this patent attack.""",1289602976

Thanks for the link. :)<p>While I do like some of the messages and ideas Michael Pollan (author of linked article, plus Food Inc.) is promoting, I always take him with a grain of skepticism. He's correct sometimes, and incorrect or questionable others. A common symptom of someone who's not a doctor or researcher in the field.<p>I personally classify him in the same arena as Michael Moore. Not to be ignored, but instead to be questioned for every made claim, requiring non-cherry picked studies and scientific research to back him up.",1289602909

It's fantastic that so much effort was put into presenting the language, but reading it is rather painful.<p>At best it's written like a oral lecture, at worst it's wordy, condescending, overuses of italics for emphasis, leads by the nose for no apparent reason, and has obvious exaggerations that aren't clarified.<p>The grammar is all fine and so is the general structure, but I suspect a good writer could help a lot with the remaining details.",1289602890
