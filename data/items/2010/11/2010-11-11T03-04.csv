I think they have a great URL name too. Very catchy and rememberable.<p>One thing that I get as a ""take away message"" from the company is ""austerity"".  I think this was reinforced by the founders speech about the business at Startup School 2010, and articles like this one in TechCrunch stressing the founders homelessness:
 <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/21/airbnb-brian-chesky/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/06/21/airbnb-brian-chesky/</a><p>I may not be the only one with this perspective. If you look at the picture that Venturebeat chose for the article, it is someone sleeping on the floor in an empty room. Which to me does not seem exactly like the kind of PR message that is congruent with hospitality.<p>Based on his speech at Startup School, the founder and CEO Brian Chesky seem s like a very charismatic guy, which is great for a CEO, but from a business perspective, it seems like it might be time to think about changing the message that is sent out to the public and leave the old message of austerity in the deep dark past.<p>Good job Brian, and congratulations on the financing!",1289447685

Google breaks the gmail exporter to Facebook. Social networks apparently are now expected export all e-mails.

Imagine you wanted to
learn French, and there were no books, courses etc available to teach
you. You might decide to learn by flying to France and sitting in a
French Cafe and just listening to the conversations around you. You
take copious notes on what the customers say to the waiter and what
food arrives. That way you eventually learn the words for ""bread"",
""coffee"" etc.<p>We use the same technique to learn about protocol additions that
Microsoft makes. We use a network sniffer to listen in on
conversations between Microsoft clients and servers and over time we
learn the ""words"" for ""file size"", ""datestamp"" as we observe what is
sent for each query.<p>Now one problem with the ""French Cafe"" technique is that you can only
learn words that the customers use. What if you want to learn other
words? Say for example you want to learn to swear in French? You would
try ordering something at the cafe, then stepping on the waiters toe
or poking him in the eye when he gives you your order. As you are
being kicked out you take copious notes on the words he uses.<p>The equivalent of ""swear words"" in a network protocol are ""error
packets"". When implementing Samba we need to know how to respond to
error conditions. To work this out we write a program that
deliberately accesses a file that doesn't exist, or uses a buffer that
is too small or accesses a file we don't own. Then we watch what error
code is returned for each condition, and take notes. """,1289445663

1892733,comment,1891725,1892516,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Erlang's syntax isn't representative of Prolog's. It was originally implemented in SICStus, sure, but Prolog lets you add your own operators, and Erlang added a ton on top of the (rather clean) Prolog syntax. How would Ruby (or whatever syntax you like) look if you made a DSL <i>by adding every operator that wasn't already in use?</i><p>You know all the problems with the ambiguous ; , . stuff that Katz gripes about in that post? Prolog terminates every clause with a period, and all related rules just occur in sequence. Prolog has a read function, much like read in Lisp - ""read the next complete (s-expression|Prolog clause) from stdin"". The original Erlang compiler needed to read all of the alternative clauses for a function in one go* , so they strung them together with "","" and "";"", which are Prolog's <i>and</i> and <i>or</i> operators. (They could have fixed this when they started self-hosting, but probably had other priorities.) In practice, it isn't a problem (and Erlang has many perks to make up for those minor syntactic irritations!), but that can't be blamed on Prolog. It's sort of like if you used Lisp's (read) to load more expressions, but since your compiler needed you to read a whole module at once as an implementation detail, you used [ and { pairs instead of parens. Yuck!<p>In Prolog, that sort of code looks like this:<p><pre><code>    parent(terach, abraham).
    parent(abraham, isaac).
    parent(isaac, jacob).
    parent(jacob, benjamin).
</code></pre>
Note the conspicuous lack of semicolons.<p>* I'm reading between the lines here, so if Robert Virding swoops in and tells me I'm wrong, <i>Hello Robert!</i> :)<p>If anything, the reason that Prolog isn't good for entire applications is that it's fundamentally a rules/database query language. It's awkward for stateful / procedural code, but if you treat it like (say) a much more sophisticated SQLite, it will be good to you.",1289445015
