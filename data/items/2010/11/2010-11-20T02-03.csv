I had a TomTom for the first year I lived in NYC and the last year I owned a car, and Google Nav was comparable on all fronts, as demoed in rental cars up and down the Eastern Seaboard since then.<p>Notable downsides include battery life and built-in mounting options.  Notable upsides include no upfront purchase, free updates, constant updates, better information density (pixels per meatspace volume, roughly), ease of ad-hoc ""mounting"" (e.g. next to the speedometer, behind the steering wheel), and automatic ""straight-to-pocket-on-exit"" theft protection.<p>It's free, it works well, and it integrates nicely with other Android apps (notably Google Maps).",1290221699

1923612,comment,1923298,1923298,0,0,akeefer,,,"I enjoy clever ways of approaching problems as much as the next guy, but I would never ding someone in an interview for not coming up with a clever-enough solution.  Good software engineering is maybe 99.7% failure-avoidance and 0.3% cleverness.  On very rare occasions you need a clever solution, but most of the time you need to solve the problem in a way that you're 100% sure will work, has no nasty failure conditions, and that other competent engineers will understand.  If there's no other good solution, or if every bit/cycle matters, then you get to try to be clever, but that happens pretty rarely.  I've seen way, way too many problems caused by people using clever solutions for problems that had straightforward-but-less-fun solutions.  (And as has been pointed out plenty of times already here, the clever solution in this case is less optimal than a more straightforward one would be).  If an interviewer seemed intent on proving they were more clever than me, or on trying to get me to throw out unnecessarily-clever solutions to straightforward problems, it would be a pretty big turnoff.",1290219255
