Firstly, in the very strictest sense it isn't true, given that defects in operating systems and processors and single event upsets due to cosmic rays can introduce some degree of randomness into computer processing. Secondly though, even ignoring all of that, it's not helpful. It's a bit like telling a chemist ""remember, the chemicals will always do exactly what you tell them to."" Well, sure, that's true in the abstract, but the full complexity of the entire process is greater than any human mind can cope with, so it's necessary to use models and techniques that bring that complexity down to human scale. The same goes for the full breadth of the complexity of programming significant pieces of software today.<p>The computer will do exactly what you tell it to, but your brain is not capable of determining exactly what the computer will do (it'll process billions of instructions a second, if you tried to fully map out the operations of a computer in complete detail you wouldn't get even a fraction of a second done in your lifetime). Which is why we have to use abstractions, models, and various techniques to render that complexity manageable by human minds.",1289685591

The law proposed in California would make it difficult to fire someone that smokes pot. I don't agree with this.

The performance of your workers should be your only concern; the ""why"" behind their performance should not bother you. If someone gets high all the time and is able to produce amazing output, then why would you fire him? On the other hand, if someone gets high all the time and is terrible at his job, you have a reason to fire him that is cause-independent: he is not performing well. Why would you care how people like to cope with reality? The only thing that should matter for you is how useful they are to you for a given purpose.<p>Reality is harsh.

Cultivation of grains is usually said to date back about 10 000 years before present. The time perspective to see this in is at least a couple of million years of evolution as what we label the genus Homo, and in the ballpark of 65 million years of evolution as primates.<p>Seeds are rich in energy and nutrients to supply the plant embryo inside during the beginning of it's growth, and consequently heavily protected, be it by mechanical or chemical means.

Of course we did have essay writing as part of the Swedish subject, but actually writing them was always done in school, as an exam, i.e. sit down for three hours and write. And the grading of our essays were never on length, it was always on grammar, spelling, style, form and coherency.<p>University was largely the same. Granted, being a CS major you're expected to write a lot more code than essays. I took a few courses that had essays as part of the requirements such as technical writing and history of technology, but those were outliers, and not the norm.

I needed the money, so I visited her at the school where she worked. I took the draft she had penned and started reading.<p>I nearly vomited.<p>The quality of writing was atrocious. It wasn't just 'bad', or 'needing improvement'. It was shockingly, horrifyingly terrible.<p>Poor structure. Poor grammar. Not answering the question. excessive circumlocution. Hackneyed phrases every other sentence.<p>I diplomatically told her that I would 'change some of the words'. As she dictated and I typed, I changed sentence order and modified her word choices. When it was finished, there was a semblance of respectability. A few days later, I heard that the lecturer loved it.<p>That, dear friend, was the beginning. I completed quite a few assignments for her, but stopped after she started quibbling over the already small fee I charged. (Note to self: Always charge what you're worth.)<p>Sometime later, a neighbour in my building called me upstairs to help a friend of his. She was typing a paper for her degree to submit that evening, and he, knowing my language skills and typing speed wanted me to help. I went, sat down, and read.<p>Oh, dear.<p>I told her that in all honesty, it sucked. I made a few changes, typed up the rest. 'Twas enough for her to get hooked.<p>Over the next two years, I did several assignments for her. It got to where she would simply email me the research question, and I'd 'learn' the subject (yes, in 2 hours), get references, and like 'Ed Dante' divide the paper into sections, and prepare material. I could do a 10 page paper in one day, which would probably net a 90% grade or better. This was after never having heard of the topic before. She would get wonderful comments from lecturers about her 'wonderful exposition' and 'excellent analysis'. This from a girl who, although not dunce, could <i>never</i> verbally put sentences together half that well. I often wondered about the intellectual prowess, or lack thereof, of her teachers.<p>It's a smug feeling, walking around as a college dropout while knowing that you can run intellectual circles around people with graduate degrees. I should note, though, that these were all humanities subjects: Use 10 words where 1 would suffice and make up some bullshit, and you're good to go. <i>It doesn't have to make sense</i> because <i>Most teachers aren't going to read it anyway!</i><p>For those of us here on HN, who are in all probability above the average, it might be difficult to understand how stupid most people are; but take it from me: they are.

They took the basket-weaving classes on the cynical assumption that it was a short-cut to getting an ""easy A."" They padded their papers with junk - that is, whenever they couldn't avoid having to do a paper. They feared the demanding teachers and ran from them. They continually looked for outline-level materials (Cliff notes, Gilberts law summaries) by which they could try to cram for a test without really having to master any of the materials. In short, they did everything possible to avoid having to think or work at the process of learning and, hence, they graduated, if at all, miles behind the hard-working students in their ability to think or to work as they turned to face real-world challenges.<p>I have never understood this mind-set. For me, the challenge was always to take on the <i>harder</i> challenges if that meant developing either your substantive knowledge or your skills in writing, analyzing, communicating, or whatever. Wasn't that the point of being there, after all?<p>The one precious commodity you have as a student that you will likely <i>never have again</i> is the privilege of being able to devote large blocks of uninterrupted time to diving into any given area and mastering it. Once you get into the real world, it is very difficult, if not impossible, ever to have that resource available to you again.<p>Whatever you do, don't squander this resource but, instead, use it to advantage. You will sacrifice in the short term as you watch your friends party away while you slave away, but you will develop depth of knowledge and habits of discipline that will endure for a lifetime while those who choose to cut corners, sadly, will not.<p>Cheating does have its victims. Those who cheat, however, will one day realize that the primary victim of that cheating is none other than they themselves. <i>Caveat discipulus</i>!",1289683384
