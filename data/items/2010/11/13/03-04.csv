1900207,comment,1899963,1900142,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I think that there's room for us to abstract away branded search under a new category, but I don't think new browsers are the answer.<p>People rely on brands when they have a product whose quality is important to them, but is difficult to discern from casual inspection.  So for example, the strongest brands tend to be in markets like soda, foods, and cigarettes, because you're putting this stuff in your body and yet you can't tell what went into it.  Branded medicine can fetch prices several times higher than generics, despite being exactly the same stuff.  Things like software - Microsoft and Google - have middle-ground brand power, where quality is important (but not all-important) and you have few indications for overall software quality at purchase time.  Things like airlines have virtually no branding power, because the trip is over in 5 hours, you've gotten to your destination, and you quickly forget about just how unpleasant the flight over was.<p>Following this, there are two ways to cut brand power of entrenched competitor:<p>1.) Make consumers care less about product quality.  Cunard and White Star were done in by the airline industry, because by cutting trip duration from 5 days to 5 hours, they made consumers ambivalent about trip quality.<p>2.) Give consumers better information about the actual quality of the product.  Google destroyed branded directory sites like Yahoo because they showed everyone just how many websites the directories were missing, and let them evaluate for themselves the quality of the sites.<p>To achieve #2, you could build some software - either a browser plugin or a meta-search engine - that ""rates"" each result on an unbranded results page, saying ""This is filled with adsense"" or ""this information is false"" or ""this was copied from here"".  If you could convince consumers to trust the ratings more than the original search, you'd break the brand power of the original search engine.  However, that's probably at least as hard a problem, if not harder, than building the search engine itself.<p>FaceBook and other social networks become dominant because of network effects, not because of brands.  They don't let you export your friends, so you become trapped there, without much value anywhere else.  FriendFeed tried to break that cycle with their meta-social-network, but it didn't work, probably because they didn't add any value besides what the social network itself had.  In cases where new software really is superior, I think it's possible to convince whole cliques to move over at once, though, and that can break the back of the entrenched competitor.  I saw it happen with LiveJournal, and then again with MySpace.",1289620295

What would artist bootcamp be?<p>I think it would be pretty difficult to come up with some kind of three month course to improve the quality of your art (that is as productive as what happens in the real YC), but you could teach artists how to market themselves, I guess. Lots of artists aren't good at that.<p>I think it would work for artists interested in working commercially, to help them get skills for whatever field they wanna go into, learning how to market themselves, and getting connections. For fine artists who just want to show their stuff in galleries and museums, I don't know how useful it would be, besides the money.<p>What were you imagining for the ""YC of art""?",1289620271

Kochan<p><pre><code>    - Well written\n    - on-par with ""Learn C on the Mac"" regarding beginner status\n    - Not platform specific (you should know Xcode, TextMate)\n    - Code examples don't generally jump chapter-to-chapter\n    \n    Bottom Line: Recommended\n</code></pre>\n--------------------\nObjective-C Books:\n--------------------<p>Programming in Objective-C 2.0 (3rd ed), by Stephen G. Kochan<p><pre><code>    - I haven't fully read this book, but use it as reference\n    - Seems to be a great continuation from Mr. Kochan's C book (above)\n    - I wish I read this instead of Dalrymple/Knaster's\n    \n    Bottom Line: Can't give a recommendation because I haven't fully read it\n</code></pre>\nLearn Objective-C on the Mac, by Mark Dalrymple	and Scott Knaster<p><pre><code>    - Continuation from ""Learn C on the Mac"", but I didn't like it as much\n    - Writing style was a bit confusing at times. I preferred Dave Mark's C book.\n    - Mac-orientated (using Xcode 3.x)\n    \n    Bottom Line: Recommended, with reservations\n</code></pre>\n--------------------\nCocoa Books:\n--------------------<p>Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X (3rd ed), by Aaron Hillegass<p><pre><code>    - Chapters 1-8 were fine. Chapters 9-35 are a NIGHTMARE for newbies.\n    - Book uses new terms many times without defining them\n        - Better know what a File's Owner is, or else Chap 9 will confuse you, etc\n    - For one of the code examples the author wrote ""I don't really expect you to \n      understand every line of that code now, but browse through the method and try\n      to get the gist.""\n    - Book must be read sequentially, and code examples must be done sequentially. \n      Code examples in later chapters can reference code 5 chapters back. There's \n      no skipping around in this book, even for unrelated topics. Very annoying as\n      a reference book.\n    - For non-newbies, gives a ""taste"" of some of Cocoa's popular API's. You'll \n      have to read Apple's docs to really learn how to use them.\n    - Reading this book after getting some Cocoa experience was much easier.\n    \n    Bottom Line: Very good intro to Cocoa's API's, but NOT for newbies coming \n                 straight from an Objective-C book. Read another Cocoa book \n                 first, program in Cocoa for 3-6 months, and then get this book.\n</code></pre>\nCocoa Programming for Mac OS X for Dummies (2nd ed), by Erick Tejkowski<p><pre><code>    - THIS is the best ""newbie"" Cocoa book I've read. Very easy to understand \n      and follow.\n    - Hand-holds you the entire way.\n    - Many ""minor"" errors in the book and code examples, which is its only \n      downfall. However I managed to figure them all out and get every example \n      working.\n    \n    Bottom Line: Recommended for newbies. Only caveat is there are a lot of minor\n                 errors in the book, but I managed to figure them all out without\n                 much sweat.\n\n</code></pre>\nDave Mark has also written a new Cocoa book which I haven't read:  Learn Cocoa on the Mac, by Jack Nutting, David Mark, Jeff LaMarche.  If it's anything like Mr. Mark's C book, it's probably pretty good. Check reviews on Amazon, etc...<p>--------------------<p>Also of note, Apple announced Xcode 4 in June 2010, which will replace Xcode 3.x ""sometime in the future"". Currently it's in beta. It has a very different user interface than Xcode 3.x, meaning just about every Mac programming book will become dated the moment Xcode 4 comes out.
