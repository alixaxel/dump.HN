I was somewhat confused.  My mom eventually explained, in not very much detail, that people had flown planes into buildings in New York.  I didn't really grok the significance of it then--I was too young to understand.<p>It wasn't until later, I think in 9th grade, that I saw a video of the planes crashing into the building, and then started to grok what had happened.

Because you know Python, it won't be hard to pick up but you'll need to accept that you're working with a different environment and live with the tradeoffs.<p>The neat thing about PHP code is that it runs pretty much anywhere.

If it's at a company like Facebook, I'm assuming their code would be at least decent or even nice. On the other hand, it could be a complete nightmare to work with bad code. A different way to look at bad code could be as an opportunity to do a lot of work and make yourself very valuable to the team.

I'm not so sure.<p>>That's a straw-man, I said no such thing;<p>You said:<p>> The team that makes PHP makes quality a higher priority than just about any other language<p>Can you explain to me what I misinterpreted?<p>> And no, I'm not going to provide you with any 'evidence' for my claims, you can take my word for it. This is not a court of law, and besides that I never made any claims about other languages before this comment and I don't feel like putting other languages and/or their developers down.<p>It's a little silly to make a comparative statement like ""The team that makes PHP makes quality a higher priority than just about any other language"" and then refuse to provide examples of where this happens and matters. If you'd just said ""The PHP devs respond quickly to bug reports"", sure, but when you start saying ""They do this better than other languages"", you're implicitly already ""put other languages and/or their developers down"". In a case like that, I don't think it's out of line to ask for examples; if there are major failings in other languages that go ignored and unaddressed, then that's certainly worth some attention. If there aren't, the whole point is moot anyhow. If there are examples of systemic problems that go ignored in other languages, I'd like to know about them - that may matter when I choose a language for a project.<p>I'm not interested in trashing PHP here; I use it on a daily basis, and get a lot done with it. I also use Ruby, Python, Javascript (both server and clientside), bash, and the occassional perl on a daily basis, and don't have problems with mysterious segfaults and unexplained crashes from 2-year-old bugs that would somehow make PHP's lack of such problems a major marketing bulletpoint.

This includes pseudorandom number generators, random number tests, as well as statistics and probability. I would really like to learn a lot more about these kinds of things since I know very little about them at the moment.<p>I'd like to know if there are some books, articles, websites, or blogs that people recommend I read. These should not be too technical (I'm in high school), but I don't want something that is too broad or general as well. An ideal book/article would be one that introduces a beginner to randomness and includes mathematics and statistics (or at least has some numbers in it).<p>In addition to the book/article suggestions, I would love to hear everyone's opinions on randomness here on Hacker News. I personally believe in determinism, cause-and-effect, and materialism (which I feel all are quite close connected). Since I haven't found any good books yet on these topics, I've learned most of what I know from websites and Wikipedia. Recently I started pondering how I could write a program the test the ""quality"" or ""randomness"" of a random set of numbers. I was confronted with the enormous difficulty of this task, and I ended up spending more time debating with myself whether this was even possible. I've heard of chi squared tests and I know there are other tests out there, but I don't know much about them. Isn't it hard to really know what you're looking for when you're testing random numbers? I mean, what is the ideal set of random numbers? Is there one?<p>This brings me to a conclusion, coming from my ignorant perspective on this area of research. I hardly know anything about what I'm talking about (so I hope know one takes offense from what I've said or am about to say), but it seems as if there could be a close connection between psychology and random number generators. A random number generator is only as random as it is portrayed by our brains. Right? The objective is too make a set of random numbers that are not predictable by <i>us</i>. It looks as if people have taken many approaches on testing random numbers, but I'd like to see some research that people have done on how we, humans, can act as the testers (which I'm sure has been done before many times). Maybe an experiment to see which random number sets humans can least accurately guess the next number in the sequence?<p>To conclude this lengthy post, I'll summarize by saying that I find the fields around randomness very fascinating and I'd like to hear you recommendations on relating books or articles that would be good for a beginner to read.<p>Thanks for your time!",1284255025

The greatest businessmen are also great communicators. They know how to convey their pitch and turn it into sales.<p>take a media studies course or two, take an intro to marketing course, take commercial law (one of my fav courses), take an international business class, and before you realize it you've just knocked out a minor in business/commerce.<p>Math wise, talk to an advisor in that department, your goal seems to fall under 2 courses: statistics, and financial math. both very useful. Calculus and higher may not really solve your issue.<p>History wise, you're on track here to understand human nature, and likely sharpen your paper writing skills here.<p>don't forget to take a science course or two, even if they aren't complicated/hard science classes, you want to avoid a narrow-focus and expose yourself to great minds all over.<p>you might also think about taking an introductory Computer Science or engineering class. I wish I had taken more of these as well.<p>One of the key things you're going to need is a good advisor or multiple advisors. Most advisors in college don't care about your track, they are just forced to help you, and have a huge volume of students to deal with. Here is an insider tip (both my parents are college profs): look through the course lists, find ones that interest you, and look up the teacher's email. Shoot them an email, tell them you'd like to pick their brain, and want some advice on their field. See if they are free, and if you can come by their office hours. People LOVE to think others find them interesting. Before you know it you'll have a handful of advisors, many whom could help you in your business pursuits as well.<p>so in conclusion, get a real major as its going to help you be more marketable to others (think people investing in YOU, long term). Take a bunch of interesting classes, don't be afraid to take a class in another department (just ask, they'll let you in), and if you plan correctly, you can probably knock out a bunch of minors w/overlapping courses.",1284254139
