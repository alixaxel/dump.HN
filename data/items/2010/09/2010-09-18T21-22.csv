1705012,story,,,34,41,stevejobs,"Ask HN: Why firms don't train workers anymore",,"Some economists cite structural factors as to the reason why unemployment has persisted at these elevated levels around 10%.  By structural they basically mean job mismatch: workers who have skills in one area are in surplus even though there are jobs in demand, though they require a different set of skills.  One way to rectify this predicament is to have firms more willing to expand their applicant pool and train those they do hire for those jobs.<p>It has become common wisdom in hiring that firms would rather leave a position unfilled than recruit someone who didn't fit the job requirements.  A new hire must hit the ground running so-to-speak and therefore he should not expect much handholding on the part of the employer.  So, if you are not a perfect match and can't already do everything stated in the job description, don't expect to get a call back.<p>I wonder why this move away from on-the-job training has taken place.  It used to be that firms would accept a wider range of applicants after screening for basic intelligence, competence, and ability.  They would take their new recruits and train them for upwards of several months.  After successfully completing the training, the new employees would be ready to take their place alongside their fellow co-workers.  This training not only produced better employees, it also engendered more loyalty as workers could see the firm invest time and money into them and would reciprocate with their work effort.<p>Now, it seems like most firms give new employees at most a few days to become acclimated with them and most of that time involves processing employment paperwork for the new worker.  Since, the worker cannot expect to be trained by the firm in any meaningful way, one shouldn't expect much loyalty from him should a better opportunity arise.<p>One reason given as to why firms have reduced their training is because they fear that after investing in the worker, he might just bolt to a competitor which may reward him with better pay because it didn't have to budget for training.  However, to take that POV, you must assume that workers are only satisfied by more money, when there are multiple factors that workers take into consideration when deciding on where to work, including how the firm treats them initially.",1284846221

More commonly there will be at least a slight skew in one direction or another, which gets magnified in absolute score the more people there are who vote based on agreement. For example, if there's a 60/40 opinion skew among people who vote based on agreement on a particular topic, and 20 people vote that way, you already have an 8-point rating gap between the popular and unpopular comments (+12/-8 versus +8/-12). On really high-traffic topics, where 100 people might up/downvote based on agreement, you only need a tiny skew from 50/50 for the votes to pile up in one direction or another.<p>I think in practice that often swamps the quality-based voting, especially on high-traffic articles: you sometimes see extremely short and not particularly insightful comments that express a popular sentiment up at +40 or more.",1284846093

Still functioning, mostly brass, and not nearly as much dust or fungus as one would think after sitting in a box for over a hundred years. This lens is a piece of film history people, and at this point rare beyond words. So i say to him, “Wow... what do you have in mind?” He smiles, and says (in the thickest Russian accent you can imagine) “I can make this fit EF you know....” My eye twinkled, and then 6 nail-biting hours later, he had it finished. My Russian lens technician is a mad scientist and he took what sounded like an angle grinder to the lens to make it clear the flange distance and the mirror.... This lens’s value is unclear.

I can't quite tell if you had this in mind, but I'd recommend actually providing a working environment that allows for end-user lay-person single-signup and use.<p>Right now there are a number of different sites that have a single automated tasklet each (one to search craigslist, one for amazon, etc).  But you have to sign up for each one individually to use them.  If you can centralize that for the noob AND allow for code-monkeys to post new tasklets, it would be awesome!
