1729072,comment,1728374,1728374,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"This article is full of it, but for more reasons than have been articulated so far.<p>One problem is that the article mistakes light for heat. Just because they get less press than Facebook doesn't mean that  old-school high-tech engineering startups don't exist. Facebook <i>et al</i> are focused like a laser on getting their names out. That is what social networking <i>is</i>: word-of-mouth viral publicity. Whereas most hardware startups are born below the radar, and the majority die below the radar, and many of the successful ones get bought out by bigger companies and never rise above the radar under their own name. But that doesn't mean they don't exist. Some statistics would have been nice.<p>The balance of companies has shifted a <i>lot</i> over time, but that's because computing has grown and matured. Back in the 1970s Silicon Valley's only customers were nerds. That meant a lot of emphasis on nerdly products. H-P calculators. Oscilloscopes. Chipsets. After thirty years of work on mobile phones, broadband networking, and UX design, we've improved computing to the point where there are now many Valley firms whose customers are non-nerdly iPhone owners and Web users. That's a huge number of people. And it turns out that you can make as much gross revenue by selling a $2.99 app directly to 2 billion people as you can by selling a $2.99 part to a firm that will make 2 billion mobile phones, but the former requires much more marketing and makes a lot more noise.<p>But the big problem with this article is that it is trying to blame a forest-management problem on the individual leaves. If the USA is not investing enough resources in ""alternative energy, better batteries, and nanotechnology"", don't blame Silicon Valley startup culture. That's putting the cart before the horse. Entrepreneurs go where the money is, and who controls how much money goes into cutting-edge hardware research? The government, mostly. Either directly (by giving out research grants) or indirectly (by providing an artificial ""market"" with a single customer -- often the Department of Defense, but sometimes an entity like NASA -- that happily commits to spending money on the very latest high-tech toys; or by creating and enforcing the incentives that drive the market for, e.g., alternative energy).<p>The Internet got developed because the government commissioned it. Rocket technology got developed because the government commissioned and bought it. H-P and Intel became big companies by selling equipment and parts to the high-tech companies that sold to the government. The nanotech researchers I know are paid by the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, or the National Science Foundation. Biotech research? Funded by the NIH or the DoD. Alternative energy? The size of our research efforts have tended to wax and wane with the size of the DoE budget; the economics of deploying alternative energy have everything to do with the cost of oil and gas (determined by forces outside of an entrepreneur's control, like taxes, and tax-funded highway projects, and tax-funded transportation projects, and zoning policy, and tax-funded military maneuvers, and government-mediated international agreements) and the extent of environmental regulation (determined by government and politics).<p>If you want to address these problems you must first analyze them correctly. If you're a rag like <i>Newsweek</i> it's easy and fun to pick on Mark Zuckerberg, but the real problem is economic and research policy: We've got an economy with flat or declining demand and lots of excess capacity (I, for one, could certainly be talked into applying my Ph.D. in EE to alternative energy problems instead of to PHP applications... if the price was right) yet our government officials are perversely engaged in an effort to further <i>depress</i> demand and <i>raise</i> our excess capacity by cutting spending. I wonder if there are any magazines that are ostensibly devoted to discussing problems in society, government and policy, instead of trading in mindless gossip, cheap shots, and PR hit pieces?",1285505952

1729054,comment,1726641,1727059,0,0,jcroberts,,,"> thinking around a corner is hard, let alone thinking outside the box.<p>Well, thinking around a corner means you're already on the outside of the box. ;) Considering you posted this to HN, you're already thinking around corners. I think you should give yourself (and HN) a bit more credit.<p>Though you never used the term ""bored,"" you more or less described yourself as being bored and your situation as being boring. I'd like to share a wonderful piece of wisdom given to me by my friend, Reginia Riley.<p>Fascination is a choice. When you choose to be fascinated, you are fascinating. When you choose to be bored, you are boring. In essence, when you say ""I'm bored,"" you are actually saying, ""I'm boring."" At the same time, fascination is the source of motivation.<p>If you find yourself being often bored, the above is tough to accept. Some even find it insulting. But it is true and the sooner you accept it, the sooner you'll no longer be both bored and boring. On the other hand, fascination with something tends to be contagious for others and tends to lead to fascination with other things.<p>If you've done half the things you've claimed, then you are motivated by challenge. You were fascinated by the challenge of figuring out the technical bits (pun intended). Sure, far too much of HN is ""money this"" and ""money that"" for startup-du-jour. Sure, money is a way to keep score for businesses, but few ever realize their real driving force is the <i>challenge</i> of entrepreneurship. In this regard, the fascination with the challenge of technology is extremely similar to the fascination with the challenge of entrepreneurship. The root cause is the same.<p>In technology alone there are countless challenges just waiting for you to choose to be fascinated by them, but it doesn't end with just tech; countless challenges and fascinations exist everywhere.<p>Your own curiosity and fascination are priceless. When you decided to give them up, what were you given in exchange for something so priceless?<p>Yes, I know this post may strike too close to home. I know it might hurt. I know you might resent me for it, well, at least at first. It was like that for me many decades ago when I needed to learn this lesson. None the less, by sharing what I learned, I do have your best interest at heart. You're asking to treat the symptoms, but I decided to treat the cause.",1285505088

But on the limited exposure I had to his work (columns mostly) - I wasn't able to see the nearly unanimous point that most of the people here seem to hold.

Even if they went back to the old system, it would probably still be as fast.<p>On the other hand, I use the RSS feed to watch the site, so I see every story that comes in, and then I visit the ones that might have something worthwhile.  And then the ones that actually do, I vote up.  If more people used the site like this, it would probably result in better stories making it to the main page, and possibly even that they stay there longer.",1285502448
