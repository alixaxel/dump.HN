Going to school is far from the only way to learn about a subject, especially if you're just doing it because you feel that it's what you should be doing.

A humanities degree at a decent-ish college should force you to get that practice at communicating in English in order to graduate. Conversely, a science degree should force you to learn a lot about how to communicate in the specialist terminology of your discipline.

Other fuel suppliers are targeting the same applications with similar efficiencies and price-points.<p>Furthermore, as others have pointed out, the claimed efficiencies assume full use can be made from the waste heat, and their overall efficiency is less than a gas turbine plant.  Their overall capital efficiency may be lower still since.<p>And to those waving hands about the expense of maintaining the electrical grid, get real.  Big stream power plants are much more energy (and capital) efficient than these fuel cells, or gas turbine plants.  It may that the efficiency of these things go up and the costs come down enough as volumes increase that the economics shift, but for now, providing base load through the grid via high efficiency power plants is going to be cheaper than why Bloom or their less hyped competitors offer.<p>I think the real appeal of these things is that they give big customers a hedge against more gaming of the markets by the electrical generation and transmission companies.

You could afford to make mistakes and learn quickly when you are at a stronger ground( a market you understand). When you're young, you'll lose your focus while thinking about the European market (using Europe as an example). European companies would ALWAYS (emphasis) spring up to cater to the European market. They might feel that they could cater the the local market better than a foreign organization and they might be right esp. if they have the focus.<p>Once, a startup has established itself in its focus market,  grown and is ready to expand to another market, starting a branch in the European market becomes that much easier. The US success will certainly help in quickly establishing yourself as a global player.<p>Acquiring smaller companies in new markets is also a strategy that is quite successful and would be easier if you've succeeded in your local market. I'm pretty sure that Yelp would be able to acquire smaller European companies and use them as a starting point for a European expansion.<p>I'm not so sure first mover advantage really helps when moving to new markets since you are an early mover in your own market and are able to learn for this period there. Also, you could look at the strategy of existing players in new market to figure out the market differences.

  y = x*x
  y = 3*x*x*x + 5*x - 7*x

Any polynomial you can think of will always, at some point, grow slower than an exponential curve. So it's not necessarily ""more complex"", but it's somewhere in between linear and exponential (informally speaking).<p>There's a whole theory behind linear/polynomial/exponential growth that is at the basis of algorithms in computing. If this interests you, you should read up on <i>complexity theory</i> - though learn the basics and stop when it gets too abstract :-)",1285744516
