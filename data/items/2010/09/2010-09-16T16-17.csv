1698300,comment,1698244,1698244,0,0,tptacek,,,"Strong disagree with this analogy. A junior developer studying yacc is not the equivalent of a junior chess player learning the Ruy Lopez.<p>In order to learn strategy from specific chess openings, you have to study them in context. Memorizing the Sicilian defense lines doesn't teach you much unless you can study it comparatively with all the other openings and learn how that game developed --- and at that point, you're just using the one opening as a forcing function to learn chess strategy seriously.<p>But that's not what happens when a junior dev learns yacc. Simply by learning to make yacc do things, the developer is given a vocabulary to express parsing and compilation ideas, in somewhat the same sense as a REPL gives you a tool to learn lisp. Sure, you could stop after learning yacc syntax and adapting the RPN calculator example from the yacc book... <i>but nobody does that</i>.<p>I think it's exactly the opposite to what this guy wrote. People who can express ideas using yacc are to be preferred to people who can talk about LALR parsing but can't show real practical work. The dev who wrote an AST generator with yacc has had to learn how to juggle a parse tree, how to traverse graphs, and what the stages of evaluating a language are. The chess player who learns Ruy Lopez gains no comparable automatic understanding of chess.<p>And, for what it's worth: yacc and MP arith --- could you have come up with two worse examples of ""shallow"" programming technologies? If you're for-reals parsing or dealing with problems that need bignums, you're already a million miles past the people who know only how to copy buffers into file descriptors or marshal queries for database engines.",1284655361

Erickson, does it convey the damage that HFCS does to one's liver? Does it convey the increased risk of onset diabetes and obesity?<p>What a bunch of straw-man BS. This is a triple-insult to our intelligence. First by calling us confused, second by thinking that a name change will trick us into buying what we avoided before, and third, by acting like we can't see the real reason for this name change: to avoid well-deserved bad press.<p>I know a lot of people who are aware of the health risks of a high-fructose diet, and not a one of them is confused by the name. And those who are only peripherally aware of the health risks but still avoid the products, may for a brief period be confused by the name changed (ironic, isn't it), but as soon as they find out about it, they are going to be pissed off.<p>Truth-in-labeling laws are a good thing. They allow consumers to make informed choices. I would argue that, based upon these laws, deliberately changing the name of an ingredient to avoid bad press should be illegal.",1284655079

As a liberal, I would consider collateral damage less of a problem when Americans die because all Americans are responsible for the present situation in Iraq, while most Iraqis are innocent bystanders. I view this as utilitarian: if people who start wars have a greater chance of death than people who don't start wars, this should in theory decrease the incidence of war.<p>Similarly, when we talk about Tyrone vs. Chip, this is a question of a poor man vs. a rich man. But more to the point, ""Chip Ellsworth III"" evokes a sterotype of the rich Connecticut blueblood, a parasite aristocrat.<p>A much more interesting study would actually look at people in different clothes, with different skin tones. This just measures people's reaction to someone whose father was overly proud of his lineage and is likely a rich socialite.<p>Obviously this says something about my politics, but again it doesn't necessarily say anything vis-a-vis deontology vs. utilitarianism. Again, my impression of the name ""Chip"" is that he's a worthless individual who contributes nothing to society.<p>However, even if we assume that both are model citizens, it stands to reason that the death of the hypothetical lower-class black man is going to put his family through significant hardship, while Chip's family has enough money that mostly people will be getting a sudden unexpected influx of cash. So the question really becomes: kill one man, or kill one man and ruin his family's chance at a decent life.",1284655030

Of course it's no surprise - Chomsky is a linguist - but such an absolutely direct connection between programming and speaking was striking to me.<p>An interesting point in the article is that GUI's have become synonymous with constrained choice. Constrained choice can be a good and useful thing, but a graphical representation is potentially much freer than text (consider an image of text in photoshop). I think the closest we have to this in common use is hierarchical tree views (as in vim's NERDTree, or java's JTree, or in windows directories), but they are still very constrained. We could have free-floating graphs with arcs and nodes everywhere; or handwritten algebra; or even active diagrams! (not sure what that would be!). But we don't. I think it's partly because the mouse is great for pointing; not so great for drawing. You really need a pen tablet (which many artists use), or.... a multi-touch screen. People, I think there's a deep opportunity here to change everything.<p>I've long been curious about Perl's growth... did it in fact grow more strongly in NT than unix?

1698189,comment,1696897,1697532,0,0,vessenes,,,"Cliff,<p>I totally disagree with your premise. If I put it in the nicest possible way, you are suggesting that engineers can hit some sort of local maxima for their design decisions with testing, but that 'professional' designers can get them out of that with bold, intuitive changes.<p>It's nice to think so. It's certainly a possible difficulty in design: many designers have made their names reworking a tired design into something iconic and revolutionary. (This article about Tag Heuer's digital stopwatch is a great example: <a href=""http://lenovoblogs.com/designmatters/?p=3748"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lenovoblogs.com/designmatters/?p=3748</a>).<p>In this case though, I think you're missing it. If you believe design's God is usability, that is that design is about providing function to actual users of the design, then you're on the wrong side of this conversation: the side with only your opinion, arguing against the side with billions of datapoints.<p>Since search is the only way Google makes money, let me ask you a rhetorical question: how long do you think Google Instant will stay turned on if it worsens the user experience? By worsens, I mean that empirically users demonstrate less advertising engagement, or show that they are getting worse search results?<p>So on the seconds conversation: seconds matter to USERS. Seconds only matter to google's ass-kicking advertising engineering team because they matter to users. Google is accidentally leaking some proprietary search information to you in those videos -- they're telling you: ultra-ultra-fast search makes Google more money because users like it better.<p>Where good design is less easy to statistically evaluate, say with Google Buzz or News, this approach falters, but I think picking on Google Instant/Homepage search is choosing exactly the wrong section of the company to complain about: these guys are the absolute best in the business in the search results / advertising world, it's their bread and butter, and they test the hell out of stuff like this before it launches.<p>As to the matter of personal speed preferences, a counterpoint: speed matters to me a lot, and I want to use a search engine like it's an extension of my brain. Case in point: one of the computers on my desktop uses duckduckgo for its search bar. It's noticeably slower than google for searches. Maybe .2 or .3 seconds vs .05 seconds. That's annoying. I notice it every time I search with DDG; it takes me out of the flow of whatever I'm doing that required some searchable information. I would guess that I'm not alone.",1284652938
