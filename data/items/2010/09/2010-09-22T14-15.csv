1716303,comment,1713352,1713963,0,0,elblanco,,,"I've worked under a person very much like Wolfram in terms of an ego so large they can't see the world around it. I remember having a product planning meeting one time where he went into a great detail about this sweeping plan he had come up with. With a great many diagrams and thought points and slides (oh the slides!), he described a system he believed would radically change humanity, advance the species etc. etc. etc. At the end of his speech, somebody asked, ""aren't you just describing essentially this piece of technology <listing several extant examples>?"" To which he paused for a good minute, minute and a half and responded ""no! it's totally different!"" It reminded me of the 7 minute abs routine.<p>The problem was not that he hadn't come up with something interesting. It was that what he had come up with was something everybody had come up with. He had just spent so much time holed up in his office writing and making diagrams that he hadn't poked his head up into the world enough to realize that he hadn't come up with anything unique or interesting.<p>This ego feeding manifested itself in all kinds of interesting ways. For example, his ego required that the things we were producing were <i>unique</i> based on what he knew. Even if we were building something that was essentially the same thing that everybody else in the world had built, he'd direct us to build it in some fashion that often ignored the practical results of good engineering practice (learned through thousands of iterations of trial and error over decades) and make it function in a way that was unique to our products, but not necessarily better, and because we were ignored so many hard lessons others had learned for us, often with significant downsides. Long after these things had been implemented, and the downsides of this approach were now readily apparent and in-your-face, we'd go back to him -- to which his reply would be, ""I'll have a solution in the next version!""<p>Months later he'd roll out his new development roadmap that failed entirely to address those issues, pretending like they had never been brought up (no Adoubt since they bruised his ego) and sent us off in another random, but already well understood direction, but cock angled so we'd end up making another round of well documented mistakes.<p>A real simple example, instead of showing aggregate sums for discrete values in a data field as a simple bar chart, he insisted we use a different metaphor that had long since been abandoned by the field -- only he refused to acknowledge it. This fit the ""novelty"" requirement for his ego, but failed the ""useful"" part of building software.<p>What finally ended it all was a perfect storm of past customers all coming and complaining that they weren't getting the product they were paying for. In some cases we'd even been paid to fix long outstanding problems created by our failure to design well understood parts of the software around well understood metaphors. The result is that he very quickly went to being ""no longer with the company"".<p>My lessons from that experience is that innovation is important, but it has to be built on the solid foundation of past experience. Even Newton understood this, ""If I have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of Giants.""<p>The problem with something like ""A New Kind of Science"" is that it's not new. It's a study of the applications of a well understood field onto other fields. If it was written without ego the title would have been ""A Study of the Applications of Cellular Automata and State Machines"" or ""Recognizing Computation in Cross-Domain Studies Using Cellular Automata"", or the lofty ""An Exhautive Review of Cellular Automata with Applications as Turing Machines."" In other words, NKS brings us back to square one with Turing's ""What is computable?"" Only looked at from another angle.<p>It's not that what's in the book isn't interesting, it is. It's that it's not revolutionary in the way Wolfram wishes it was. It's ""merely"" evolutionary and Wolfram refuses to understand that. And just like my old Boss always chided us with a ""wait and see"" and a twinkle in his eye whenever we pointed this out, Wolfram's response is ""wait and see"".",1285166934

1716296,comment,1716002,1716221,0,0,adamtj,,,"Physical exertion equals power.  You can't have the same power with less physical exertion.  It's a trade-off between aerobic capacity and anaerobic capacity.  You can pedal in a high gear, using more strength, or you can pedal faster in a lower gear, maintaining the same speed, but using more cardiovascular capacity.  In both situations, if you are going the same speed, you are putting out the same amount of power.<p>Non-circular gears change the gear ratio as you pedal.  It effectively shifts down in that part of the pedal stroke where you have the least strength.  Since the bike doesn't slow down, your feet must speed up.  Then, when your feet swing around to where you have more strength, it effectively shifts up.<p>My argument is, if you are pedaling at the limit of your strength, you are in too high a gear.  Shift down and spin your feet faster.  You'll use less strength, and more aerobic capacity, enabling you to maintain an equivalently high power output, but for longer.  It's easier to run a marathon at a constant speed than to sprint 100 m at a time, taking walking breaks to maintain the same average speed.",1285166816

Imagine when a cyclist pedals very hard and the bike sways from side to side from the force exerted on the pedals.  Now I'm not sure if they are trying to reduce the movement of the bike, or make it feel more natural.<p>The thing I cannot make out is the switch from gears to a single system.  Is the output of work the same as the force going in, which would mean that you have to pedal the same amount going up a hill as going down, or is there a variability of work like a rowing machine?

But here are my thoughts:<p>* $110K is OK. In California that's not a lot of money. However, don't be fooled by Google base salaries, they are lower than other comparable companies but the bonuses can be out of this world. Typically they could be 30% of you salary but if you can get your hands on an important project, sky's the limit.<p>* As others have noted, Google is a <i>huge</i> resume booster. This is doubly true in your case, since you're from another country and have a ""no-name degree"". After this, it would be orders of magnitude easier for you to land a new job in the valley.<p>* But know that the Google culture can be caustic, esp. if you're older and is not quite used to pulling 11pm workdays regularly. The culture is super alpha-geek with every young hot shot trying to prove him/herself and make their fortune in 2-3 years. Tl;dr: You will work your ass off.<p>* The initial project is crucial. Although everybody says you can change projects at will, this can only be done after 18 months or so for new hires. I had friends stuck in backwater projects leaving G without waiting that long.<p>So, summary: If you're planning to relaunch your career in the Valley and maybe eventually go the startup way, this is an <i>excellent</i> opportunity, do it immediately. Go there, quickly get your green card, work for 2 years, and jump either to a better position in G or ideally to another company.",1285165771

Optima's strokes have a gentle concavity to them, unlike most other sans-serif faces. Gill Sans tends to be wider than the Platonic sans-serif face, and the tips of C and G are sliced off with a vertical stroke, leaving quite pointy terminals behind. Helvetica's most famous birthmarks are the surprisingly complete tail on the lowercase a (compare to Arial's a) and the surreal curly tail on R.<p>Of course, some typefaces are even more subtle than that. If you showed me Baskerville and Times New Roman, I could probably tell you which was which, even if I couldn't identify Baskerville on its own. Distinguishing between the hundreds of typefaces in the Bodoni/Didot genre is way beyond me.<p>Anyway, if you want to learn more about typography, I heartily recommend picking up a copy of The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst - if you're a practicing graphic designer, it's got lots of useful information; if you're not, it's a book by a typographer with decades of experience who also happens to be a well-known poet, writing about something he's passionately interested in, so you know it's going to be a good read.",1285165674
