Using a ""GUI"" isn't ""one true way"" as there are a near infinite amount of ways to structure a GUI.<p>Command line tools often use graphics to display their results and GUI tools often show their results in textual form so the main difference between a command line interface and a GUI interface is how to provide input.  With a GUI I have to click in the right place to make actions happen.  This puts more onus on the developer to make sure everything is where it is expected.  With a command line tool I have to read a document or help output about how to use it and memorize this information if I wish to be efficient.<p>I'm not saying there should be no command line.

Of course speed up depends on what are you comparing, but if you benchmark GPU against decent four core CPU the speed up is in order of magnitude.<p>For dense Matrix currently is about eight times (<a href=""http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=172176"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=172176</a>) on CUDA 3.1. That is before the CUDA 3.2 which claim 50-300% performance increase.<p>For sparse matrix the speed up against multi core CPU is about ten times (<a href=""http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=83825"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=83825</a>).<p>All available as a public libraries (<a href=""http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_2_toolkit_rc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda_3_2_toolkit_rc.html</a>).<p>jedbrown, please provide a source of your estimates.

Google's stated reason and the posters logic holds up to the test of possibility.  And it would seem to fit into Google's general way of doing things and its ADHD tendencies.  I guess we'll all have to just watch and see what happens.",1285657889
