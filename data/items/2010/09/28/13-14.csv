We quickly decided once we went out and talked to potential customers that it was a no go.<p>1) Very few customers wanted to upload their data to the web. Even less were allowed by law.\n2) Most had integration problems - i.e. they couldn't actually access their data because it was in disparate systems.\n3) Most people didn't actually use the information for anything, it was simply to provide them with ""evidence"" that they were right before looking at the charts. As a statistician this makes me sad, but it was the way things were at least when we investigated it.<p>Over time we gradually realised why BI was priced so high; it needs system integration alongside it. Now it turns out that we may have been wrong (gooddata.com are doing a good job as far as I can tell) but I still think it's the tip of the iceberg in terms of potential market.<p>My advice: target a niche with a huge problem where the customer is unable to get at their data at the moment.

1735643,comment,1734916,1734916,0,0,jakarta,,,"There are some negatives to Green Dot's business model. Here are a few things that were pointed out to me last week:<p>-Barriers to entry are pretty low. Walmart has already lowered fees from $9 to $5 for a new card and from $5 to $3 for monthly maintenance. NetSpend, AccountNow, Russell Simmons' RushCard are all in this business and more competitors appear to be sprouting up. Blackhawk Networks (owned by Safeway) just announced they are entering this business.<p>-50% quarterly churn rate. That means every 6 months Green Dot has to find an entirely new customer base to replace the one that left. My guess is the rate is high because of the monthly fees.<p>-A lot of people will be wowed by the company's massive growth rate (722k stores in 2006, 3.1M stores in 2009). But it is all almost entirely due to Walmart adopting their product. I am not sure if depending on Walmart for your future success is entirely beneficial, they have a reputation for bringing costs to the bare minimum. The variable costs for issuing a new card are so low that I think this is a major possibility.<p>-Then there is the outrageous valuation. 46x earnings, 25x book value. This is a pretty pricy company and I think competitors are going to pounce on their space, bringing down margins and customer activations. A 10% drop in pricing with a 30% drop in customer activations makes the company barely profitable.<p>In Jan 2011 the lock up on insider sales goes away. I expect during that time we'll see a ton of selling.<p>Also if you want to learn about this industry here are some great resources:<p>paybefore (magazine)<p>www.cfsi.org (Center for Financial Services Innovation)",1285681562

But Debian faces export restrictions on OpenSSL, so their copy of Ruby is missing a number of important standard libraries by default.<p>Rubygems can't really clean this problem up, because Rubygems assumes it's running on an actual copy of Ruby, and not a half-broken Debian Ruby.<p>To get a working Rubygems installation on Debian, I usually 'apt-get install ruby-full', which installs a non-broken Ruby interpreter, and then install Rubygems itself from a tarball so that apt-get stays _far_ away from my Ruby setup.<p>I don't blame Zed for being angry about this.

They reported 1mln. charts in the system a few years ago, but last few months traffic to their web-site declined significantly and last 2 weeks the site is down at all. Anybody knows - what's happened to Swivel? My startup is somewhat similar to Swivel so I wonder whether the initial idea was bad or they faced some technical or organizational problems. Thanks.",1285679241

1735539,comment,1734916,1735128,0,0,pxlpshr,,,"Yes. Another prepaid card company called NetSpend filed to IPO this year too. The original founders of NetSpend, Roy and Bertrand Sosa, are hispanic immigrants and pioneered the prepaid model before GreenDot after recognizing a gap in the industry. As the story goes, they created NetSpend with only $750 in their apartment living room.<p>They later left NetSpend to found MPOWER Group in 2007. Our company was acquired by one of the MPOWER companies this year, and we couldn't be happier about the leadership and long-term vision here. The Sosa brothers are extremely genuine people. This time they're taking a closer look at banking and underserved markets, and it's a great time for the right kind of innovation in this industry if you ask me.<p>Last ~2 years have been spent building out product and a multinational infrastructure, I think you'll start hearing more about MPOWER in the near future as they ramp up marketing and social media efforts here in the States.<p><a href=""http://www.mpowerlabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpowerlabs.com</a>\n<a href=""http://www.mangomoney.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mangomoney.com</a>\n<a href=""http://www.revworldwide.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.revworldwide.com</a>\n<a href=""http://www.yapsend.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yapsend.com</a>",1285679173
