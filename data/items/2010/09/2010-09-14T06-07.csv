The religions in the middle east at the time were extremely taxing; one of the reasons there is no priesthood in Islam is the sheer amount that would be paid in tithes to the pre-Islamic religions in the area.<p>Furthermore, as context, many of these verses are in a historic situation where Muslims were betrayed by an entire group and were on the verge of annihilation.  Please don't pretend that violence is abhorrent in that situation.  Regardless of what group you belong to (or don't), the fact is that every group in that situation lashes out; whether it is burning and leveling large parts of the South or expelling / killing a group of people who had betrayed a nation.  This clearly is not meant to be the behavior in an era where there is peace between various groups.<p>If what you say is true, you need to account for why there were any Christians or Jews or Hindus for that matter left alive in territories conquered by Muslims.  I don't doubt that there were atrocities and acts of malice / evil inflicted by conquerers, but the unfortunate truth is that it is a common part of war; then and now.<p>I won't be bringing up the topic again, I don't think it is worth it and I doubt you are honestly interested in the issue.

1689766,comment,1689065,1689065,0,0,edanm,,,"I think the author misses the point of the phrase ""C is just portable assembly"". It does't <i>literally</i> mean that C is just like assembly, it's usually a shorthand for saying the following things:<p>1. C is used in most contexts where you previously had to use assembly, and would use assembly if C didn't exist.<p>2. C is the language with the ""lowest level"" code imaginable.<p>3. What this means is, you can map almost <i>any</i> command in C into a specific command or a few specific commands in assembly.<p>That last line is the important part. C is optimized in the sense that every command in C will give you a deterministic amount of commands in assembly. When reading C code, someone who knows assembly can usually tell you what will happen in the compiled code. You won't see an operator which doesn't have a deterministic runtime or memory footprint. In fact, most of the questions on ""Why C has this""/""Why C doesn't have that"" can be answered exactly like that: you can't implement it with a deterministic set of commands.<p>In those senses, C is just like Assembly, at least more so than any other language around.",1284447321

1689759,comment,1688623,1689064,0,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I thought on this a bit. And I do believe you are correct. Because as you note, he did in fact condition the space such that 1/3 <i>is</i> the correct answer and is stretching.<p>He goes on to say <i>""Now this means that if we want to claim that the probability that the man has two boys is , what we are really claiming is that he is equally likely to inform us that he has at least one boy, in all situations where it is true, independent of the actual gender distribution of his children.
I would argue that this is quite unlikely, as if he has a boy and a girl, then he could equally well have told us that he has at least one girl, whereas he couldn’t tell us that if he has only boys"".</i><p>I see this point but I think this example does not lend itself to explaining the notion of defining a good prior because it is such a simple scenario - it biases responses to focus on the absurdity and unnecessarily fretful complexification.  And it opens the door to all sorts of subjective objections so that nothing can actually be said. For example I can say that given this guy is talking in riddles he likes being vague and will always give me just enough true information to keep things sane but interesting. Or given he is being wishy washy then he is a deviant trying to mess up my day, very likely he has 3+ kids. A more muddled scenario would have been better for similar reasons to why humans are the hardest to animate 'correctly' - no preconceptions to distract from the presentation.<p>Otherwise the maths is straight forward, we have been given a space to condition on: he has two kids and one of them is a boy. P( (B,B)) = 1/3 since (G,G) is eliminated.  Giving a probability of 1/2 makes sense only when we are not given the key piece of information of at least one is a boy. <i>The information we get tells us how we can construct our probability (sub)space</i>.<p>Consider for example I met this strange man for the first time and see that he has a son and for some reason I know he has two kids. Then the probability of two sons is 1/2. This can be seen as the fact that knowing the gender of the kid I saw says nothing of the other kid's. If we whip out some probability spaces this can be seen by thinking in terms of {(M,F), (F,M), (F,F), (M,M)} X {1,2}. Where (M,F,1) is I met the older kid who is his son first. Or (M,M,2) is I met the younger son first.<p>Some time ago I wrote a simple finite probability space toy in F# to help in building probability intuitions by using simple spaces. Ill use it here because I think code can be clear.<p><pre><code>    let Z = cartesg [""MF"";""MF""; ""12""]
    let S = definePSpaceSimp Z
    let pboy = conditional  (fun (x:string) -> x.[0] = 'M') S

    let p2b =(conditional (fun (x:string) -> x.Contains(""MM"")) pboy).Space |> pboy.Pr

    >
    val S : ProbabilitySpace<string> =
      {Space = set [""FF1""; ""FF2""; ""FM1""; ""FM2""; ""MF1""; ""MF2""; ""MM1""; ""MM2""];
       Pf = <fun:definePSpaceSimp@43>;
       Pr = <fun:definePSpace@41>;}
    val pboy : ProbabilitySpace<string> =
      {Space = set [""MF1""; ""MF2""; ""MM1""; ""MM2""];
       Pf = <fun:filtrSpace@30>;
       Pr = <fun:definePSpace@41>;}
    val p2b : PositiveReals = 0.5
</code></pre>
Thus we see the probability of the compound event: 2 boys given seen 1 boy is 0.5. This is because based on the information I got, the compound event I can define is very different from being given information - 2 kids, <i>at least</i> one boy: {(M,F), (M,M), (F,M)}<p>>EDIT: I find it interesting that a mathematical argument is downvoted. I would appreciate any flaws to be pointed out along with a downvote so I might correct my reasoning. Currently, I do not think I made any mistakes.",1284447096

I know investing in some stocks won't make me much, I'm not delusional and I know how much prices generally fluctuate. I've tried finding classes in my college but there aren't I know. I also don't know anyone who deals with anything related to computers, software, websites, or anything technology related. I wish someone would let me in and show me what they do so I have an idea of how businesses operate on the internet.<p>2. Makes sense, deal in something you are interested in. but I am not planning to sell to retailers but people who will directly use my product(other businesses). The product that I have in mind is non-perishable, and in demand daily, the type of competition is closest to a monopolistic competition, probably somewhere in between perfect competition and monopolistic, so entry and exist is not very difficult. Profit should probably be low though, until I have ""relationships"" with the people I'm selling to.

I didn't see a single homeless person / beggar but I also didn't see a single person that looked ""middle class"" in US terms.<p>- People seemed really happy to talk to Americans.  I remember talking to a woman celebrating her 86th birthday and she told me (through a translator that she'd ""see me next year in Miami"".).<p>- Based on my understanding of the USSR, I was expecting a cult of personality around Castro, but there was no 'Placa del Castro' or anything like that.  The only cult of personality was for Che Guevara, who was everywhere.<p>- There were two economies...one for tourists and one for Cubans.  If a Cuban had a job, like in a hotel, where they could get dollars, they would be very well off.  Everyone else was left with ration cards.<p>- We met a kid who spoke English but was afraid to talk (or to be heard talking) in English in public.  He took us to his house where we talked for several hours and then there was a party (his grandmother's 86th birthday) where we (a friend and I) drank rum and partied until the wee hours.  The rum was in a really old plastic jug (from the 80s?) that they would pour they monthly ration or rum into...they saved up for celebrations.<p>Overall I walked left thinking that Cuba would be a great place to live for most people but if you were the ""Bill Gates"" of Cuba it would suck.  I suspect that when the embargo ends and sanctions are over (both ways) Cuba will become the ""Caribbean Tiger"" like Ireland or South Korea.  The population is very healthy and education but the infrastructure sucks.  All they need now is capital investment and they will really thrive.  I suspect in the long run (as in 100 years) Communism will have served Cuba well relative to it's regional peers that didn't experience Communism...similar to China.",1284445149

Further, I have been to a couple events in the bay area, including a YC sponsored one where I mingled with investors and talked to them about various business ideas. I've not gotten the impression that these people have the first clue.  Not talking about PG or the other YC people, but just my general impression of people who represented themselves as working for venture capital firms. (and not angels, angels are a different breed I believe and I've had less contact with them.)<p>2) There simply is not much need for outside capital, as we have a large angel round worth of our own capital in the bank.<p>3) Strong impression that there is no chance that YC would take us.  My co-founder has zero interest<p>4) YC is predicated on a certain set of assumptions about the type of business, and the priorities of that business.  We don't share some key premises there.  Namely, it appears that YC believes in betting it all on a short term, big reward, while we believe that a very quickly growing, profitable business will produce a better return for us, at lower risk.<p>5) As I mentioned we don't really have a need for outside capital, and the contacts YC would get us would primarily serve the purpose of doing additional rounds.  Thus, in my opinion the increased risk of having to adopt a specific outside investors timetable, and operational style, along with the risk of having to follow bad advice, does not seem to be worth it, for money we don't need.  While YC doesn't subject us to that risk directly, joining the YC program would be getting on that track....",1284444925

That is, they do not simply target ""the C programming language."" Instead, they often target GCC or the Intel C compiler. Even more, they usually target an architecture. In theory one may have to deal with many of the complexities of different implementations, but in practice development is usually restricted (or sometimes duplicated). I think that you may be taking my position a bit too concretely: I don't support the statement that <i>all</i> opcode output is predictable, nor do I support the statement that no other language has elements of the same techniques which make C so useful for systems development.<p>Simply, view my post as a (possibly slightly exaggerated) relation of the systems C development process from one low-level kernel developer to another.
