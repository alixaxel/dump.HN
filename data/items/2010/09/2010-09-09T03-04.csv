1674286,comment,1674103,1674103,0,0,ndrarmst,,,"Code review.  Oddly enough, it wasn't so much the issues that were raised by the reviewers that made me a better programmer (though they certainly helped), but the knowledge that every aspect of my code could be inspected, and I'd be expected to fix it, that forced me to double- and triple-check my work before sending it off.  Since that time, even when I'm working on personal projects, I find myself coding defensively, and will often write sections of code a couple times until I'm satisfied that it is unambiguous, correct, and clear.<p>This has helped immensely when I've gone back months later and tried to figure out what I was thinking; now, it actually makes sense!",1284002231

What really makes me angry is the joke that is the VC industry, which is really the root cause of this. In April I talked to an associate at Andreesen-Horowitz (where Kevin Rose is the mayor on foursquare), who said that digg, after many difficulties, was on the right track. From their perspective, engineers are cogs in the machine and the only thing that matters are executives. I worked closely with the executives at digg, and they spent the vast majority of the time feathering their nests, and the digg v4 rollout is just the logical conclusion of them draining value for five years.<p>Also I said this was a ""rough guess."" Comments on TC from people I know who worked there (there's been a mass exodus for the last two years) suggest I'm mostly correct.<p>Finally, I think ""sour grapes"" is a poor rejoinder.
