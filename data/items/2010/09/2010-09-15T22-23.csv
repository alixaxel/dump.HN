I mean, that's a valuable thing to know, but without margin or profit, it's an easy figure to game.  Ask kozmo.com or MCI|WorldCom or any of the ""Generate lots of revenue then IPO"" companies of the late 90's early 00's.

I'd massage this a bit with some closed alpha testing, etc... but this is the gist:<p>Sell ads and kickback a percentage to the siteowners while working in charity donations to remind folks that you're not evil.<p>Create a script to categorize your install base.  Eg: Gadgets, Tech, Food, Personal, etc.  In version 2, plan to categorize in real-time contextually.  A good ad network partnership (see below) will help you with this technology.<p>Change your TOS.  Send an e-mail to everyone asking them to verify that your script categorized them properly, to check out the new TOS and the new ad feature.  Clearly and honestly tell them why you're making this change - the project will die if you don't.<p>Test some ""run of network"" ads.  Input a few different variations, measure clicks (volume and geo are important).<p>After a couple of weeks, approach a few different ad networks at the same time.  An Adtech conference is coming up in NY in November... use their exhibitor list as a hit list.<p>Negotiate with the ad networks.  Depending on the demographics and CTR's, I bet with a 5m install base, you'll have some good offers.  Reliability is key here - ad networks start and stop all of the time.  In contrast, remember that big networks come with more constraints.<p>Here's the part that's going to keep this from being evil:  Allow your siteowners to sign up and insert their own affiliate / user codes.  Give them a percentage of the ads.  If someone does not sign up, give that same portion to a charity such as Kiva.<p>As an alternative to selling ads - start looking to sell the whole thing.  There are a few funded startups I can think of that would keep your beer fridge full for a couple of years in exchange for what you have built.<p>As a final (tacked on edit) idea: Survey your siteowners.  With such a large install base, if you ask what advanced features people would like, you may be able to get some people to upgrade to a paid subscription model.  You might be able to use this in conjunction with the adrev model above.  In your survey, don't give the siteowners any ideas - you don't want to sway them.",1284591077

1696139,comment,1695571,1695571,0,0,javert,,,"This article is wrong.<p>The author is conflating two philosophical schools of thought, <i>Rationalism</i> and <i>Empiricism</i>, with two other concepts (with a complex relationship), <i>reason</i> and <i>science</i>.<p>Point 1: The author is defining reason incorrectly. He states that reason is ""internally generated,"" that it starts with ""your internal sense for what is right and pure."" The correct definition (taken from a dictionary) is: the mental powers concerned with forming conclusions, judgments, or inferences. The difference is that the author claims that reason is basically internal/introspection, whereas in actuallity, reasoning requires both internal mental processes (such as recalling concepts you've formed previously) <i>and extrospection</i> (observing the world around you, learning from it, etc.). The Rationalist school of philosophical thinkers (e.g. Descartes) <i>argued</i> that that extrospection is fundamentally flawed or not trustworthy, so the definition the author uses is actually, basically, the rationalists' position. (Later philosophers like Kant picked up with this and ran with it, claiming that since reason is faulty, you must resort to <i>faith</i>. Indeed, the rationalists were typically highly religious, although basically everyone was at that time.) I, personally, disagree very strongly with that position, and I suspect that many HN readers also disagree with it. So be careful not to accidentally ""accept"" this position as a valid definition.<p>Point 2: Empiricism is a philosophical school that was formed in reaction to the Rationalists. Empiricist philosophers pointed out that the Rationalists were incapable of achieving true knowledge about the world by rejecting perception, and insisted that we just go by experimentation. However, they accepted some of the Rationalist viewpoints about the way reason works, and thus were very skeptical of reasoning, prefering ""hard data"" and the like to explain things. (This is ironic because validating a philosophical claim would require reason, so you can't use philosophy to reject reason without contradicting yourself, but I digress.)<p>Point 3: The actual relationship between science and reason is not ""science vs. reason"" or ""science OR reason"", as the author states. It's ""you need to use reason to do science."" Science is a kind of technical study of the way the world works that uses certain techniques; that's all science means. There's things you can do using reason that aren't <i>technical</i> enough to be called science (like paying your taxes or thinking about philosophy). But there's no science you can do without using reason.<p>Conclusion: The claim that reason and reality are fundamentally divided is the root premise of the author's blog post. This was Kant's position. Kant's main goal was to state that reason isn't really useful, so we all have to go on faith; he was trying to uphold ""God, faith, and immortality"" (to cite his most famous quotation). That gives me the creeps. I strongly disagree with Kant.",1284590839

For example, Starbucks has $60,000 in revenue per employee, while DirecTV has $1.6mm. Surely no formula that would make predictions for household brands that would make errors anywhere from +66% to -94% is useful.<p>The main reasons for the variance is (1) how much value add the company generates for its customers, and (2) what portion of that value add is labor.<p>Some companies' products are very labor intensive, but they outsource most of that labor, so the company's product has high revenues per employee because there are ""invisible"" employees not on the payroll due to outsourcing arrangements. This is where the company is providing low value-add. For example, consider a trucking broker, who provides transportation services to its customers, but outsources the actual trucking to owner-operators who are not employees.<p>Other companies have high value-add, but very little of it is labor. For example, a television cable company has high costs for licensing media content, which is a big part of the value it provides for consumers, but that licensing content requires low levels of labor (unless they vertically integrate).<p>Companies that have high value-add, mostly in labor, tend to have moderate levels of revenue per employee.

I've also got some ""hacker time"" coming up, about two months with no deliverables so I can work on a new infrastructure.... And I'm ruminating on a solution which ill share below.  I'm keen to know if any of this is clueless or foolish, as I have not worked with any of these new hot technologies before, though I do know erlang and JavaScript pretty well.<p>All these technologies are to be assembled into a pre-built appliance. Most of it is the set of apps described in the title, but the real magic comes from a couple relatively static applications written in node.js.  To increase capacity, we add more nodes. Should be zero configuration.<p>Under node.js there are services I have to write-<p>cluster management-- which is catch all for connecting new nodes to the cluster, or migrating off of nodes going away.<p>authoritativeDNS-- the cluster is it's own name servers. This say load can be balanced, and we can dynamically add customers custom domains to our app and support them right away,<p>web platform with caching-- this will run couch apps, custom JavaScript stored in the couch and but run outside under node.js<p>Simple queue service, and cron service--- using node.js and redis.<p>This is tied into redis to cache dns records, static or unchanged pages using the etag couch provides, etc.  The cluster manager reports the local nodes CPU load in redis as well, and so the dns knows to return address to direct traffic to nodes in the cluster that are less busy. This way apps can add customer dns so that our neophyte customers can get set up by merely putting out name servers into their registrar.<p>Most of the product functionality will be written in CouchApps, except for places where couchapp is limited..... Like showing multiple views on a page, and checking for uservauthentication. Don't want one customer to be able to see anthers private info. Well do that, and cron like tasks in node.js.<p>All of this is stored in couchdb which is distributed dynamo style by big couch.  Like couchapp we have JavaScript in design documents, this makes deployment really easy.  Part of the node. Web platform will support a/b testing and beta/production splits.<p>In this way, new node.js level functionality can be added by putting functions in JavaScript into documents and adding urls to the URL routing scheme that point to these handlers, all loaded from the couch, but executed in node.js.  So, deployment still is just a push into the couch.<p>The reason for doing things this way is to make continuous deployment easier, but also to never have to reboot or change e servers much.  The node.js services will be well tested and unchanging.<p>All of this will be built up using turnkey linux into an appliance.  This can then be deployed on amazon or vps or wherever without the need for a load balancer in front. Since it does it's own dns and the authoritative dns is the cluster itself.<p>This should reduce maintenance to the bare minimum,and I can push out a new set of appliances over time and slowly migrate trafic to them once or twice a year when I need to update core funcationality.<p>I might go with web machine and raik instead of node.js and couch if I can find a compelling reason to, but the big holdup there is th question of how much of ahassle it would be to attach beam files to documents and get web machine to run them.<p>I know this is unconventional. I'm up for criticisms and suggestions, especially if there is a way to avoid writing all this code in node.js.

1696033,comment,1695571,1695571,0,0,Dove,,,"I think both science and logic (what the article calls Reason) are poor tools for studying complex systems--things like software and people.<p>The guess-and-check methodology of science works great when one is studying simple, consistent, statistically tractible behavior.  Ask a scientist to characterize gravity, and he does a great job.  But ask a scientist to characterize something complex--e.g., <i>MS Word</i>--something with a lot of inputs and outputs, complex behavior which changes in subtle ways in different circumstances--and he'll have a tough time with it.  The reason is that the models of science converge inexorably and certainly, but slowly; too slowly to be really useful when studying complex things.  The scientist may be able to characterize a few simple features of something complex, but it'll be a long time before he can totally describe the object's behavior.<p>In the case of complex systems, my preferred epistemic tool is revelation.  Read the source code.  Ask the person what they're thinking.  Peek under the hood.  Ask the designer what he was trying to accomplish.<p>Logic in particular serves an interesting purpose in complex systems.  One usually thinks of logic as a tool to go from secure axioms to secure conclusions, but in the case of an unknown system, the axioms and models and definitions are what we're trying to discover.  Hence, my primary use of logic when studying a complex system (e.g., while debugging software) is as a tool to highlight paradox.  That is, to go from clearly-impossible conclusions to unstated false assumptions, or better definitions.  Not, ""The source code shows nothing changing the value of this variable, hence something else must be causing the bug,"" but ""The source code shows nothing changing the value of this variable, yet the value does change, hence my assumptions about what can change a variable's value must be wrong.""<p>Of course, when one is studying something opaque and complex, such as a market or biological system, revelation is not available as a tool.  But one should still retain respect for the limitations of science as a methodology in that situation, and respect the complexity of reality in contrast with the simplicity of science's results.",1284588283
