If you're the kind of person that has no problem learning stuff on your own then it could work. This really includes some of the core CS stuff such as having a good grasp of algorithms, math, etc. Depending on the area you want to move in you'll have to learn some more specific stuff as well. Consumer web .. learn how to deal with scaling; Game development .. learn 3D oriented math. I'd say having a solid grasp of the execution speed of algorithms is something important regardless of the domain you're in. It will serve you a long way.<p>It is not so much what you know as what you can do. Can you read a paper on some technical subject and then implement it? That sounds like something an employer is interested in.<p>You should probably be more interested in working in smaller companies, since they're more likely to hire talented individuals. Most big corporations are built so that they can easily replace people should it be needed, smaller companies not so much.<p>A tip for the job hunt: Get a programming portfolio. Since you don't have a degree you'll have to show your skills, but that's no problem! Put your best work on it. :)<p>Good luck with whatever you decide to do.",1284284014

The term ""unconference"" has been applied, or self-applied, to a wide range of gatherings that try to avoid one or more aspects of a conventional conference, such as high fees and sponsored presentations. For example, in 2006, CNNMoney applied the term to diverse events including BarCamp, Bloggercon, and Mashup Camp.""<p>It's a great event to discover ideas outside of your usual social life.

Actually learning to play the game well takes a lot of effort, time and practice. Learning the rules of a language is easy, actually learning to program is hard and takes time.<p>I think any sufficiently intelligent and motivated person can learn to code at least at a modest level. Just remember that its going to be slow, frustrating and painful. Be sure not to be caught off guard. A frustrating problem that comes at you all of a sudden, can dry your enthusiasm really fast, be sure not to let that stop you. You are supposed to feel pain and frustration, you're brain would rather watch bad TV, or browse reddit or something. Just like when you exercise your muscles ache, because they'd rather you lie on your couch with a bag of chips and a can of soda. Pain is good, it means you are learning.",1284283600
