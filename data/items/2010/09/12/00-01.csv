They have enough money to advertise the game on the trains.  The interesting thing is they have hardcore users who will travel all around Japan to check in to locations.  This actually ties into part of their business model, where they are paid by businesses to hold special events at certain locations.  A couple years ago, they said they could get a couple thousand people to go to a location just by holding an event there.",1284253197

1682760,comment,1682636,1682636,0,0,photon_off,,,"Switching languages, for me, has usually been a matter of remembering syntax, some minor differences (such as how arrays work, what things are built-in, etc), and the patterns in each language that naturally arise from those two.  Of course, things get more complicated if the language itself is structured differently (eg: Javascript), but there are a lot of underlying concepts that carry over (scope, stack, OOP, etc).  In short, it just takes practice.  If you're ""advanced"", you should be able to pick up on it pretty quickly.<p>To get a feel for syntax and how PHP works (especially == and reference/value), you should read the docs.  They're a breeze and provide lots and lots of examples.  The user comments are generally incredibly helpful and will notify you of caveats that you might need to be aware of.<p>You'll also want to start off by learning how to build objects in PHP, how associative arrays work (they are great), and how to use __autoload() to include classes on the fly.",1284253040

A PhD can be viewed as a statistics/ML/numerics expert from day 1 - a BSc needs to be promoted to it. Additionally, spending 5 years working on hard problems means you will be a smarter person. You will interview better, you'll know more, you'll be capable of doing more.<p>But lets suppose PhD == BS. Which is a better place to be right now? Work experience 2003-2005, PhD 2005-2010? Or PhD 2003-2008, work experience 2008-2010? I suspect that even if the PhD is pointless, current work experience > past work experience.",1284251010
