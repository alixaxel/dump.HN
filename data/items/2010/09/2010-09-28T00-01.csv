They are horrific. The closest analogies would be share cropping or indentured servitude, though at least there is an out if the band fails.<p>The way a lot of record labels work is that they will give a band a cash advance. The band uses that advance to pay for living expenses. They are also forced to use it for various costs such as studio time, recording, producing a music video, etc. The band earns a percentage of the gross revenue for album sales (say 7%), the label earns a larger percentage. The band pays back their advance using their share of the earnings.

Compared to it, Go, a much more recent development, tends to do quite well (just my estimates, PL mindshare is a bit hard to measure).<p>I think it's mostly because of some internal and positioning issues. I haven't been following it recently, but I remember some problems with different standard libraries, D 1 vs D 2, and three compilers that each had issues. Maybe that's resolved, but it certainly didn't make things look too good.<p>Also, it seems to be more a successor to C++, which makes some people a bit distrustful. Yes, it's much cleaner, but also quite a bit more complex than C, and not a total programming environment as Java or C#. So it mainly gets its users from the C++ camp, which isn't the mightiest army nowadays (And whose Windows battalions aren't supported very well by D).<p>Go is in the news a lot because of its Google and Unix (Pike, Thompson) heritage, because it's a bit simpler (more C crossed with Python than ++C++), and because it has some prominent concurrency support, which is close to the current hype (every emerging language has to prove its mettle there).<p>By the way, don't read this as a value judgment. It's just a personal assessment why I think that Go is currently a bit more popular and will continue to be so.",1285635153

They target ONLY running. But still let us compare :)<p>There are dozens of mobile apps for fitness with various feature & price range. (1) Nike app works with external sensor mounted on hardware. Hardware costs $30. Probably runs for 80-100miles, 3-4 months. (2) Some app use on boardGPS some use on board accelerometer such as RunKeeper, but it will not work on treadmill or indoor running (3) App using on board accelerometer (4) Some app allows manual entry of exercise data (5) Garmin/Sunnto professional athlete gear is good in accuracy and shelf life. But it is expensive & cost $120 to $200. Also getting data to PC or online is multi-step process.<p>Overall, variety of solutions for runners based on their needs. Can our app offer additional value or complete replacement? Nope.

I am not sure, and I do not know how to even guesstimate it.<p>Probably we are better off targeting users of healthcare device such as blood pressure monitor, glucose meter, and such machines. New & slightly expensive machines in market have USB port that allows data downloading to PC. How about offering  Smartphone App to allow users to capture data instantly & do all sorts of analytics? No need to plugin your device to PC to download data n analyze.

Sort of. These numbers are dubious because there was a $1.4 billion charge for ""unusual expenses,"" including a write-off from the IPO for disintegration costs and a total write-down for Bebo.com.<p>The real balance sheet in the 10-Q from last quarter is further obfuscated by a $182mm stock purchase of AOL by Digital Sky Technology, the Russian investment firm that bought a chunk of Facebook a while ago.

Smalley claimed that the spooling was just around the corner as well. Carbon nanotubes have a billion dollars or more per year industry for some time and have had over a billion spent on R&D. We are now at about 1000 tons per year for total world production and the common lengths are usually a millimeter or less. Centimeter lengths are still rare. Nanocomp technologies is one of the main companies working with longer than millimeter or centimeter lengths and making a few tons per year of those lengths.",1285632261

Using an easy language on a hard problem means you can hire someone who knows a lot about the problem instead of having to worry about the langauge.

the problem of solving systems in sparse matrices. Recall that the Conjugate Gradient, used as a direct solver, can solve systems in n-dimensional matrices with m non-zero entries in time O(mn). So, if we could find a graph H with O(n) nonzero entries that was even a 1-approximation of G, then we could quickly solve systems in LG by using the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient with LH as the
preconditioner, and solving the systems in LH by the Conjugate Gradient. Each solve in H would then take time O(n^2), and the number of iterations of the PCG
required to get an ǫ-accurate solution would be O(log ǫ−1). So, the total complexity would be O((m + n^2) log ǫ−1).""<p>I'm not really sure how you get O(n) 1-approximations of G (or even really what a 1-approximation is yet, as I haven't really read the paper), but that seems to be the idea, I think.",1285632013
