It was well understood early on that most of the ""gold"" features would be stuff that was too expensive (computationally) to give to everybody (especially before the server upgrade), at least from the start.<p>The great fear gripping everybody was truly that Reddit would somehow become ""for-pay"", and that content previously free would now become non-free (a fear which didn't make much sense as the community is the one providing the content, and the admins might not be too media and ad-savvy, but they're not stupid)<p>> But either way, in that specific case, there would have been some vocal rebellion if the paid-for features stayed locked behind a paywall.<p>Doubtful. 1000 comments/thread is a nice feature for instance, but it didn't exist (at all) before gold and it's not exactly a deal-breaker.",1285044463

When governments ""just let people be"", we get robber barons, rapacious working conditions, and a beaten-down underclass.

How progressive it should be is a legitimate matter to be debated.<p>The problem is that and middle class pay <i>far too little</i> in taxes, to the point where they happily allow elected officials to overspend.  This is entirely rational from their perspective, since the most outrageous spending will only result in a few more dollars of taxes owed over the course of a year.  It's known as a collective action problem in economics.<p>For example, the Iraq war should have cost the typical middle class taxpayer at least $500 in 2001, $500 again in 2002, and so on.<p>Instead, Bush gave a tax rebate intended to make a large swath of the population ignore the massive cost of the war.<p>Why shouldn't the average American pay just over $1 per day for a war?  Why shouldn't he/she pay just over $1 per day for healthcare?  As it stands, both of these were free so why should anyone really give them too much thought?<p>Bottom line:  If the public actually had to pay for the grand schemes, there would be significant pressure not to waste money and taxes for everyone would be far lower than they are today.<p>To argue against this you either misunderstand my point and thing I'm advocating raising taxes or you think that the public being blind to spending is a good thing.",1285043848

My name is MK and before talking about the service itself, let me give you the background :<p>Back in the day when Klaz, a Starcraft audio-commentator on youtube (http://www.youtube.com/user/KlazartSC) was still active, with some friends we realized that commentating was just way too complicated (downloading/recording/synchronizing/uploading and if you want to do it with friends over ventrilo it's a nightmare). If it was made simple then we would probably have korean matches commentated in a billion languages and analysis/strategy video podcasts all over the place.<p>We decided to do something about it.
Two years later it's finally ready.<p>What it does is basically that you can pick any YouTube video and cast over it instantly. You can draw, put pictures and write over the video and add links to wikipedia or whatever you want. People can watch you doing all of this live, or just wait till you're finished and then watch your vod. Absolutely no software install or download or upload required. Oh yeah and you can do it together with friends too.<p>Time passed by and nowadays SC2 will probably get the most use out of it but after launching our private-Beta, we've noticed many people are using eLive for many other reasons than just casting a Starcraft match : working with friends over the web, singing karaoke, making video game reviews, doing interactive audio/video podcasts, doing translation... wow, people are just so creative !<p>Here some videos if you wish to learn more about us :
http://www.elive.pro/main/vfaq<p>And if you want to test it yourself, just apply for a BETA key and we'll be happy to send you one when we have free slots :)<p>PS : this is the TechCrunch FRANCE article talking about eLive :
