That's why I'm so awesome!""<p>It's true, of course, to an extent.  ""Writing crap"" is absolutely essential in any creative endeavor.  Otherwise that crap gets impacted, and the good ideas can't get out.<p>However, the editing and refinement process is at least as important, I think.  If all you do is <i>just</i> write a lot, most of it being bad, it might just all stay bad.  You have to be <i>trying</i> not to write crap, knowing that's what you'll often end up doing, and be ok with that.<p>It's the same in software development.  Over-reliance on design can lead to analysis paralysis.  Software is best when there's code first, and analysis afterwards.<p>It's probably worthwhile to have a dev branch and release branch in blogs, for the same reason as it makes sense for code.  Friends and regulars can see the just-released content, but the mainstream page doesn't show anything that hasn't been vetted and carefully edited.",1283651628

1663790,comment,1663292,1663292,0,0,edparcell,,,"From the article: ""CouchDB + Another Layer as Web Server is Redundant"". This is very true, and the biggest difference to other databases I've used, NoSQL or not. It ends up being a double-edged sword for CouchDB.<p>On the one hand, it saves having to context switch between thinking about the database, thinking about the web server, thinking about the web framework, etc.. For a single developer, this is not to be sniffed at. As learning is often done by lone experimentation, it makes CouchDB an excellent system for learning about NoSQL. It's also great for prototyping, where you don't necessarily want to spend a huge amount of time creating an industrial strength back-end.<p>On the flip-side, it means that if you do run into a situation where you want to use another layer, you've just given up the biggest advantage of CouchDB. For my current project, I found I would need to be able to integrate authentication with an existing Kerberos system - the easiest way to do this was to use Apache.<p>I also had slight reservations about CouchDB's approach of limiting what you can do - everything has to be a map-reduce - to ensure scalability. The plan as I understand it is to introduce further safe operations down the road. I'm sure that approach will yield dividends, but for now it seems quite limiting - similar to eschewing C in the 70s because it does not have garbage collection.<p>Didn't mean to beat up on CouchDB too much - it's a fine system, but I prefer the flexibility of MongoDB at this point.",1283649288

If you took the U.S. off the chart I would certainly suggest a causal relationship. In very general terms: the wealthier the society, the more educated and independent-minded the people, and the less likely to embrace religion.<p>I wonder how the chart would look if you separated out all the U.S. states. I'm not from the U.S. so I'm not sure about this, but I wonder if there are distinct differences between where the various U.S. states would fall on the chart. In other words, is the correlation between the wealth of a given state and its religiosity?",1283648969
