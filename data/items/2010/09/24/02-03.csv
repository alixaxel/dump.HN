It also makes serial renaming of multiple files easier and much more keyboard friendly.<p>also maybe it's because I've gotten used to the cmd+up and cmd+dn to go up and down directories (and also open files). in the end, we're all arguing a matter of preference.<p>on closing windows:<p>it's equivalent to minimizing for windows. I want my mail app and calendar apps to be running and able to give notifications, but the window itself doesn't need to be rendered.

I'll try to explain.<p>This search results showing that there are a lot of Linux home users who're using Ubuntu because it is most popular <i>Desktop</i> distro. Its popularity in a large extend due to money Canonical spent on promotion. (Remember free shipping of CD's and other actions)<p>But if you're considering a server segment, there are traditionally CentOS, RHEL or Fedora. Or even that stupid Unbreakable Linux. Why it is so? (Because it got that way!)<p>First, because most of really important key developers, like mr. Ulrich Drepper, works for RedHat or with Redhat. Redhat also actively supported by IBM, that's why RHEL is a such huge success.<p>Second, since RHEL4, when they made that stupid decision to maintain all the patches by themselves (RHEL4's kernel source rpm had up to 300 patches in it, but I'm not quite sure you know what it is all about.)<p>Now, they work with a mainstream kernel developers, so all their code got a most extensive testing possible. This is what Google's Linux engineers still cannot understand - the best testing and bug hunting is in primary linux source tree.<p>So, what about Ubuntu? Compared to Fedora it is outdated, very conservative, desktop-oriented distro for an average mediocre user. I don't want to go deeper and try to compare source packages of key components, such as kernel, glibc and related, but I'm pretty sure there are different set of patches. One can compare common packages like perl, python, erlang, gcc, php by themselves.<p>Conclusion? OK, 3-5 years ago using Ubuntu or Debian as a server instead of Fedora-derived distros was a sign of non-professionalism, if not a fanboyism or even ignorance. What changed today? Almost nothing. Ubuntu is following the same conservative policies. There are some so-called server editions of Ubuntu, but it is rather a marketing movement.<p>And, you might be surprised, but key kernel developers are using Fedora. =)",1285295695

He broke the von Neumann bottleneck and changed the way we think about, and use, computation. Hillis's contributions affect nearly every scientific discipline, not to speak of the daily lives of most people on the planet. When he speaks, I listen.</i><p><i>""We misunderstand cancer by making it a noun"", Hillis says. ""Instead of saying, 'My house has water', w' say, 'My plumbing is leaking.' Instead of saying, 'I have cance'"", we should say, ""I am cancering.' The truth of the matter is we're probably cancering all the time, and our body is checking it in various ways, so we're not cancering out of control. Probably every house has a few leaky faucets, but it doesn't matter much because there are processes that are mitigating that by draining the leaks. Cancer is probably something like that.<p>""In order to understand what's actually going on, we have to look at the level of the things that are actually happening, and that level is proteomics. Now that we can actually measure that conversation between the parts, we're going to start building up a model that's a cause-and-effect model: This signal causes this to happen, that causes that to happen. Maybe we will not understand to the level of the molecular mechanism but we can have a kind of cause-and-effect picture of the process. More like we do in sociology or economics.""</i>",1285295330

There are plenty of time to catch a few cycles.""<p>I was not going to downvote because of disagreement. It sounded like shilling with no reason to back it up.<p>I have no idea what you mean by predictable or how you have a timeline. You mentioned housing starts so I will assume you were specifically speaking to residential real estate. It sounds simple to say look at rent to income or housing starts for an indication of housing price trends but really if you dont know what you are doing dont bother.<p>You mentioned interest rates for example. You do realize that a conforming home loan is sub 4.5% right? Well, you might not know that for most parts of the country (prices behave differently in land constrained regions and or low population density) the biggest factor in predicting nominal home prices changes is the interest rate on a home loan. Home value and interest rates are inversely correlated just like most asset classes but a little more so since we have a social obligation to make it easier to own a home. Anyways, my point was if you think we are japan and will have 15+ years of low interest rates that might be ok to neutral for home prices. Keep in mind japanese housing prices countrywide have been falling since 1991. If interest rates happen to move upward anytime soon housing prices will be crushed. We have no room for interest rates to go downwards anymore. Also we have a ginormous shadow housing inventory that is being held by banks who have tattered balance sheets. There are a lot of homes that should be going through the foreclosure pipeline that are being held because a flooding of the market with empty homes  would destroy the value of the mortgage obligations that are being held. Someday these will be sold however. It wont be pretty for the housing market or for the owners of the whole loans.<p>Ramblings. But my point was that nobody really has any idea whats going to happen in the future. The government has a plan of its own with its own agenda. The banks and servicers all are trying not to get crushed under an avalanche of bad assets and are hoping they can earn/appreciate their way out of it. Maybe underwater home owners in non-recourse states will wise up and walk away. There is some hoopla in the industry about the lack of ability to foreclose due to crappy title transfers (exchange of ownership of debt from one play to another) and this could effect the ability to lend since people are already nervous about unknown consequences for lending in this political environment. Houses are nice. You can live in them (and for a primary res I dont think pricing should really matter over 30 years although the math to be sure is somewhat complex). But nobody really has any idea where prices are going or to what magnitude. But maybe you know something I don't.<p>Oh, fyi there are case-shiller options and futures available on the CME.
