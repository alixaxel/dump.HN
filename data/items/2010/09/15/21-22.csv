1696003,comment,1694084,1695977,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"I really don't like making statements relative to other app servers. Each app server has its own merits and we believe people should decide things for themselves by running their own benchmarks and tests. However this question has been asked so many times that I'm inclined to answer in order to avoid confusion and in order to encourage people to test things independently.<p>There exists a belief among some people that Unicorn is faster than Phusion Passenger 2. We've tested this a while ago and it turned out that they're evenly matched. Unicorn's speed is on par with Mongrel's. Unicorn's shared socket helps with fairly load balancing requests between processes but its positive effect on performance is not always significant. We've actually experimented with shared sockets and found that, when done improperly, it can actually hurt performance thanks to the thundering herd problem and the fact that catching EINTR in Ruby is expensive. All of Unicorn's I/O is handled in Ruby. A lot of Phusion Passenger's I/O is handled in C++. Instead we've opted to optimize our global queuing implementation to reach the same load balancing effect while speeding things up.<p>Phusion Passenger 3's speed surpasses Phusion Passenger 2 by far. You draw your own conclusions.<p>Of course you can take my answer with a grain of salt. I encourage you to verify these findings yourself.",1284587669

Miss Ching (a danish/asian model) would go into a bar and ask for the chief bartender.<p>2. Once found she would tell the bartender that her employer wanted to get in contact with them about some very important things in a few days.<p>3. She would then handle them a cellphone with a few numbers  stored in there already. And then leave.<p>4. Over the coming days the phone would then send SMS's out to the bartender which was basically pre-defined. If people wrote back then they would receive some random SMS back saying things like ""Wisdom lies in paradox""<p>5. We would also have website that people could try and hack.

I recently realized that freeway lanes have similar performance characteristics as database tables do - the more transactional the lane, the more likely it's going to have a backlog. So, instead of driving in the fast lane, the one immediately to the right of it is usually faster. My guess is that this happens because of people swerving in and out of the HOV lane illegally in an attempt to save a few minutes or whatever. Avoiding the furthest 2 right lanes is important when you can as well  as people tend to merge twice immediately after entering the freeway (this is on I-10 in Phoenix, which is between 4 and 7 lanes across each way, depending on what part of town you're in).<p>Knowing which lanes contain forced merges allows for planning ahead as well, since you know that you're going to have to deal with double the traffic in a rate-constricted channel.",1284587353

This way, you get some money, the customer gets a discount and possibly a ""trial"" period. Also, it lets you know that your beta testers have a vested interest in your beta.<p>A complication or interesting point is you could make the beta private/paid only. But what if you wanted the beta to be public and still have paid users for presales?

I've seen heavy recruitment from companies.<p>Developing on the emulator can be done, but depending on the functionality of the app, more difficult if you have unusual input control or unusual UI.  The trick is to mimic the screen size correctly on the emulator.  It allows you to scale the screen.  Make it about the same size of a real phone.  Screen dimension can be tricky.  There are devices out there with unusual dimensions, like 320x570.  Make sure you test with different emulator screen dimensions.",1284584593

I don't see the rate of new information being created going down and this makes good search even more important.<p>Let's not forget that searching the web requires literacy and an idea of what you want to look for. Formulating queries is something that might require a certain maturity to do. Kids learn to search at an older age naturally in my view.<p>A lot  of us are in a generation that started using the web pre-google during the Yahoo years (;p) . Using Yahoo was more like clicking around on a portal website that the kids under 12 (at least in this article) are using today. Once google came around most of us started using it almost as if it was natural. (well I migrated to altavista before that and I was 12 when google showed up. but that's my experience).",1284584425
