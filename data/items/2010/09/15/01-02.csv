Much less back and forth.  Also, the ones without the knowledge get annoyed when told their designs don't translate well to code.<p>HTML/CSS does not take that much effort to learn.  Just put in the effort and at least pick up the basics.  Read a book on it.  You don't need to know the ins and outs, but knowing the basics will help you design sites.  And maybe you will find it interesting, and learn all the nitty gritty too.  It will make you a better web designer.",1284515875

If I'm in sproutcore I have to search/replace the whole project searching for references which takes minutes and is tedious.<p>The reason it is difficult is because you can't use any of js tools that leverage a js interpreter - your code isn't valid until it's run through the sproutcore build system (which, as previously mentioned, is pretty slow).",1284515424

No good lawyer is going to bring a lawsuit that costs his client more than he can recover, and you also have to take into consideration the ability of the other party to pay (an LLC that has assets comprising a laptop computer and a few thousand dollars in the bank is not going to be a target for any litigation).",1284514060
