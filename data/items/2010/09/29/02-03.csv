For an installation of any significant size it's almost certainly not going to be as simple as switching a deployment to legacy mode.  You've got shell scripts to port, different configurations for core features like kickstart, firewalls, different package management.  If you made an ""environment standardization"" bet on Solaris 10, you've got barriers to overcome.<p>But I'm not saying that Solaris is going to live.  Just that, as someone who uses Solaris 10, Oracle seems to be tightening up.  I think that they don't really care that much about Solaris and are just going to squeeze it dry.  I'm far more worried what they're going to do with Java.<p>> In order to be kept alive, the Solaris boxes have to be able to perform tricks Linux boxes can't and, to a large extent, this is not the case.<p>True, but keep in mind that their competitors are often limited to ""enterprise"" distributions like RHEL and Ubuntu Server.",1285729195

DC/Baltimore is mostly gov/DoD/intel.  Philadelphia (whole delaware valley, really) is heavily pharmaceutical industry focused.  It's all off line.<p>The difference between a silicon valley web startup and most of the country is that in most of the country founders are getting rich off of high margin niche business software.  They are selling licenses to specific industries with specific problems for thousands or tens of thousands of dollars, or doing lucrative consulting.<p>These people simply do not write blogs or do web published interviews.   They have no incentive for mass market publicity.<p>There are only so many ways to make email and ebay/CL more efficient, which I think broadly sums up most mass market web ventures you read about.  I'm firmly convinced the way to go is with a list of 20 specific corporate customers in mind.  Make something you know they need.

It's a great tool, but serves a very different purpose.<p>When it comes to social code, Bitbucket's great. It's Mercurial's equivalent to GitHub, and it fills that role awesomely. I have an account on there where I post stuff I want to be public, including some open-source parts of Kiln's source code, such as our new kbfiles extension.<p>Kiln, on the other hand, is really focused a lot more on making DVCS a really great experience for companies. A lot of the stuff that makes GitHub and Bitbucket great--the whole social experience--kind of gets in the way of just getting stuff done in a corporate environment. You still want the ability to have personal repos and branches and everything, but you also want really tight integration with bug tracking, really easy ways to follow everything going on with a project in the forms of activity feeds and comprehensive search, APIs to manage everything, a really solid code discussion system so that your developers can talk about code and make sure it's really great before it gets integrated, the ability to quickly answer questions like, ""What bugs were open in this point release?"" and ""Have I contacted customers affected by this to let them know it's fixed?"" Kiln and FogBugz together provide those things right now.<p>I'm sure Bitbucket and Jira <i>could</i> provide that functionality eventually, but it's not what they do right now. And I think that's fine: we <i>need</i> a service that provides really great social tools, and Bitbucket's that. And we <i>need</i> a DVCS hosting solution that's awesome for companies, and Kiln's that. Given that something like 90% of developers still use centralized SCMs, there's piles and piles of room for both of us to coexist peacefully.",1285728969

Groupon deals aren't only valid for one day, thus the restaurant owner has no idea when people are going to be in the restaurant or not.<p>2. I reject the notion that I restaurant owner would prefer to serve a full restaurant at half price over a half full restaurant at full price. From my discussions with businesses who use Groupon, they mostly see it as a tool to drive repeat customers not one-time customer volume. Very few restaurants can make ANY money at 50% menu price, much less at 25% menu price (after Groupon takes their cut).<p>3. I would be willing to bet the 'tipping point' effect of Groupon on the sharing of deals is nearly insignificant.

Back in 1924 the great Moses Schönfinkel demonstrated that all computable functions can be defined in terms of just two primitive functions: C (the constant function), and S (the fusion function). So here is the source code for S, the Mother of all functions:<p><pre><code>  #include ""node.h""\n  #include ""type_S.h""\n\n  /*\n  Fusion function (Verschmelzungfunktion)\n  S x y z = ((x z) (y z))\n  */\n  static void step(void)\n      {\n      int f1 = pop();\n      int f2 = pop();\n      int f3 = pop();\n      if (!f3) return;\n\n      set_pair(f3, P(R(f1),R(f3)), P(R(f2),R(f3)));\n      }\n\n  int type_S(void)\n      {\n      static int node = 0;\n      if (node == 0) node = new_combinator(step);\n      return node;\n      }</code></pre>",1285727344

We are keen on building up case studies, but I think some small pivoting in the product focus is needed or the marketing/sales process is going to be tough.<p>About your suggestions for pivot, I honestly like both ideas, this is what I set this thread up for. We have trouble focusing on creating experiences that shoppers would enjoy because, frankly, we are not online shoppers ourselves. Perhaps we will come up with one or two plug-ins, as suggested, and we will do some customer development from there.<p>Thank you for your comment.",1285725622
