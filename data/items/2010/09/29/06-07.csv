This sometimes results in video glare, with lots of rays coming from the background. Sometimes the old fashioned computer screen seems less tiring, showing lit-up text on a dead backround.</i><p><i>“So you should try to reduce video glare, perhaps by reducing the figure/ground contrast. For example, our screens on this website usually have a light tint on the ground to reduce the electric blue-white video glare. Of course on the computer screen, one can just turn down the brightness control when working at night or in a darkened room. Television control rooms and airplane cockpits generally have darkened backgrounds upon which to display lighted data.</i><p><i>“On paper, white type on a black background can result in filled-in serifs because of the printing process. It is also harder to read white type on a black ground (there surely must be some evidence about this). But we should never be working at the edge of legibility in any situation, so legibility tests might not be relevant.</i><p><i>“For projection presentations, obviously the figure/ground contrast must be sufficient to overcome the ambient light. Check your presentation room out in advance, test your projectors, find out how to control the room lighting and the window curtains if necessary. You should simply look at the various design solutions under real conditions to see what is going on, and not depend on verbal discussions such as this to decide!”</i><p><i>-- Edward Tufte, March 19, 2002</i> <a href=""http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=000082"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0...</a>",1285743270

The comment in the article mentions that this ""could come in handy in sub-Saharan Africa, where less than 25 percent of the population has reliable electricity"".  My best understanding of this statement, from limited experience in africa, is that grid electricity is available but a little unreliable - it goes down frequently.  This soccer ball will have expensive electronics for capturing energy and an expensive battery.  Of course, if I have intermittent grid power and a battery, I'm already all set.  I don't need the electronics to capture the kinetic energy.  Worse, if this thing breaks in any way - and it's literally getting kicked around - to repair the innards probably requires cutting the soccer ball in half, which makes it pretty unlikely to be repairable.",1285742778

I think the problem might be that on a long running system there is rarely any truly ""free"" memory.  Rather, one chooses to dump cached pages.  It's possible that the cost of copying across nodes plus the eventual reread of the cache makes it a negative?  Although I'd have to think that it's better than a certain write.<p>I can see the logic where allocating on a non-local node is potentially a mistake.  Depending on how many times the memory will be accessed, it may well be worth the immediate hit to swap a page to disk and keep all your accesses local.  For the swap, you at least have evidence that it hasn't been used that recently, thus may never be used again.  It would be sad to work yourself into a corner where lots of long lived processes are constantly cross-allocating.<p>Edit to add:<p>Looks like a good reference paper here: http//www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/christoph/.../numamemory.pdf\nOnly skimmed, but it makes it sound like 'page migration' is already in place.<p>I'm particularly interested in the idea of migration partly because it might help provide an answer to my recent StackOverflow question: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784434/inserting-pages-into-large-mmap-files-without-copying-data"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3784434/inserting-pages-i...</a>",1285742717

Philly always had that low-key feel that I enjoyed, and was less than 100 miles from NYC. Public transit sucks though.<p>What's sad is that a majority of the local economy is outside of Center City Philadelphia, and Philadelphia proper mostly due to the city wage tax which takes out almost 4% on top all other deductions in your paycheck. And young people want to live in the city, so it's a tough sell.<p>It reminds of pg's essay on Cities and Ambition.

Less work for all developers, short learning curve. Write once, work everywhere - same idea that prompted Resig to design jQuery. Write webapps that aren't tied down to particular devices. Improved touch-optimized UI/layout - almost native widgets. Current solution everyone uses is self-written custom CSS/png files to make their apps look like iOS widgets. Having jQuery team behind such a UI will ensure your application will always look good on all devices. Team will ensure support for international platforms, not just US-centric. jQuery Mobile will be rolled into jQuery Core - ONE file for use on desktop AND mobile devices (only 1kb increase in size). Expected release date: Oct 16, 2010 at jQuery Conference in Boston.<p>2) jQuery 1.4.3: Will include jQuery Mobile, expected released Oct 16. Lots of bug fixes. Improved .css() performance across all browsers. Feature allowing plugins to delay execution of the DOM ready event. Better support for easing in shorthand effects (hide, show etc.). Data can be bound to Flash objects, presenter unsure how useful this feature will be. Improved type Support, fixes to noConflict.<p>3a) Future of jQuery I: Lots of community improvement ideas - jQuery team will make their core roadmap more concrete and publicly available in the future. More information will be available for those who wish to contribute with the bug fixing and performance optimization  efforts. If you are the JS/jQuery developer with a few years of experience, please try to help with the bug fixing and other project tasks. Even reviewing others' code and writing test will be appreciated by the team. Voting and commenting on what bugs will take priority are also in pipeline.<p>3b) Future of jQuery II: Modular version of jQuery - people who are used to jQuery UI are aware that it is possible to break down a library into chunks. Modular jQuery would be slightly different - you may be able to load the core of jQuery first and then load the rest of the code later on, as you need. If you want to use animate features and don't require other jQuery features, you may be able to load the base jQuery, then animation code, then if another plugin on same page needs other part of jQuery, the plugin can use it's own set of jQuery features. It would be a complex feature to create but would help page-load times. Still an idea in the pipeline at this time. Will decrease the amount of jQuery core code you need to load in a page.<p>My personal thoughts:<p>Can't wait for the jQuery Mobile. I am working on the perfect webapp to utilize jQuery Mobile thoroughly. Love the single .js file, even if it was 20-30kb larger, I wouldn't care personally - hopefully it won't have 200kb of assorted CSS/png files like the jQuery UI. Improved speed in 1.4.3 sounds cool too.",1285740540
