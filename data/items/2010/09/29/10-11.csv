When IE8 came out, Chris Wilson answered similar questions, and a lot of his answers amounted to '<i>shrug</i> Guys I'm on your side here but we had to limit our ambitions because this is Microsoft and there are strategic decisions that we had no control over.' At least this way we get a sense of what those decisions are rather than get a good cop/bad cop act. (Not to say that Wilson isn't a natural good cop.)",1285755282

1738840,comment,1738667,1738667,0,0,cperciva,,,"I've long thought that the vesting-equity model is wrong, and if I were free to design a compensation system I would set it up more or less as you describe: No equity grants, but wages would be paid as a combination of cash and convertible debt.  If someone leaves the company, they keep whatever they've been paid so far; they would be treated just the same as any other convertible debt holder.  The debt would have a significant rate attached (say, 1% per month) due to its high risk.<p>Unfortunately, I don't think this would ever work, due to income tax issues.  As I understand it, the convoluted games startups play with equity grants are to avoid having the equity taxed at its real value; but I imagine that the IRS would demand that income taxes be paid immediately on the total wages, including the value of the debt -- which would very quickly create a cash flow crunch for all but the wealthiest employees.<p>If this were possible, though, it would make things much simpler -- just imagine, having founders, employees, and angel investors all hold the same form of equity!<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, I would say that the cash+debt model should continue indefinitely, rather than being limited to 4 years.  The idea that someone's effective salary should drop dramatically 4 years after they were hired (i.e., when they are no longer vesting stock each month) seems absolutely loony to me.",1285755259

Is it because of the expense of getting fine grained and low latency market data [eg. exchange colocation]?  Or is it due to the contacts needed in the biz to get the 'investment' funds to trade with? Or is it because only large financial entities have access to these risky speculative trades?<p>Side note : I see Jane Street Capital use Ocaml, and some other quants use KDB/Q for implementing these kinds of algorithms, so it seems innovative languages give leverage here.
