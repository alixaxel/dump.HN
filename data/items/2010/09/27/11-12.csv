Part of the reason that I've stuck with it so long is that Liquid is really easy to learn. I'm of the opinion that anyone capable of understanding a for loop and if statement can learn the basics of Liquid within a day.<p>I know there are a few other apps that use Liquid, including one of your competitors.

1731382,comment,1730731,1730731,0,0,noibl,,,"There's more to Intellectual positioning than signalling one's intelligence, even if the underlying motives are assumed to be more-or-less base. Hipsterism in general is about being ahead of the curve, not necessarily being the smartest in the room. With Intellectual Hipsterism that means being conversant with the latest ideas, not the most complex ideas. To be up-to-date with the latest radical thinking gives one a privileged position in the discourse because the proportion of the group for whom your input seems novel and interesting becomes greater. This puts the Intellectual Hipster at odds with the mere 'meta-contrarian' because a conservative opinion conservatively argued will never be perceived as novel or interesting. The Intellectually hip[1] will therefore argue in favour of a passé or seemingly discredited position using novel (conbinations of) techniques and references, thereby making the retro idea cool again!<p>--This post sponsored by the IH Institute, Salt Lake City--<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizek"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zizek</a>",1285588521

When I think of DRM in, say, music purchases, I usually think of some way of restriction. But here the title DRM actually makes sense: it's Digital Rights <i>Management</i>. This actually enables the developer to distribute the right to the full version of the game to it's customers, not to restrict them. By that same token things like Valve's Steam allow Valve to distribute games, although on much more restrictive terms. Of course the FSF would completely disagree with any of this, but I would definitely like to hear RMS's take on this particular setup.<p>I guess the big question is going to be ""does this scale?""",1285588509

1731349,comment,1730731,1731327,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"<i>The old money might have started off not buying flashy things for pragmatic reasons - they didn't need to, so why waste the money? But if F. Scott Fitzgerald is to be believed, the old money actively cultivated an air of superiority to the nouveau riche and their conspicuous consumption; not buying flashy objects becomes a matter of principle. This makes sense: the nouveau riche need to differentiate themselves from the poor, but the old money need to differentiate themselves from the nouveau riche.</i><p>Ignoring the throwaway at the beginning, the rich may become and stay rich because of a strange thing called frugality, which in many societies is considered a virtue.<p><i>A total loser might come up to a woman without a hint of romance, promise her nothing, and demand sex. A more sophisticated man might buy roses for a woman, write her love poetry, hover on her every wish, et cetera; this signifies that he is not a total loser. But the most desirable men may deliberately avoid doing nice things for women in an attempt to signal they are so high status that they don't need to. The average man tries to differentiate himself from the total loser by being nice; the extremely attractive man tries to differentiate himself from the average man by not being especially nice.</i><p>See the dozens of human sexuality articles -- most of them posted here -- on why men do things (or not) to attract women. Much of the consensus is that both the ignoring and providing things of ephemeral value are social signalling devices, not counter-signals. In other words, what the author thinks of as signalling (and perhaps many men do as well) is actually <i>not</i> signalling. It's not that there's one thing and then another on the opposite side, it's that the signalling mechanism itself is poorly understood.<p><i>So my hypothesis is that if a certain side of an issue has very obvious points in support of it, and the other side of an issue relies on much more subtle points that the average person might not be expected to grasp, then adopting the second side of the issue will become a signal for intelligence, even if that side of the argument is wrong.</i><p>If your hypothesis is that people adopt intellectual positions as a signal of intelligence, then the positions themselves do not matter. One could pick any absurd topic -- death in this case -- and find those coming out in support of it simply for signaling purposes.<p>The error here is subtle yet pernicious: there may in fact be very good reasons for thinking death is a good thing. I don't know. Beats me. But I do know that once I start thinking of other positions in terms of signalling, I'm no longer thinking of the benefit or drawbacks of the argument. [Insert long discussion here on the definition and uses of the ad hominem] This was the author's self-identified thesis. And it is a logical fallacy. (to restate: people take ""wrong"" positions purely for reasons of signalling)<p>That enough for you?",1285587583

I'd say it's pretty damm relevant when someone decides to hack something up real quick and says they don't mind using it knowing that it's giving erroneous data with several <i>meter</i> deviations. I bet you wouldn't find it hyperbolic if you were, let's say, 10 meters away from someone being located with that software.",1285585330

I think I would cry if I had written a decent documentary and then seen what the producers do with it. Cookery programmes are terrible for this — you never see people actually doing the bloody cooking.",1285585324

If you insist on pursuing this  strawman and broadening the debate to new, unrelated philosophical heights, so be it.<p>I will say now that it is childish argument. You give no explanation for why a ""gene"" should be considered the base unit of evolution rather than an ""idea"". Especially when natural selection stopped applying to suburban humans with access to healthcare a long time ago. By all indicators, human evolution is now occurring through technology, not genes. Technology and debate over how to use it is the most likely cause of humans diverging into multiple species, not genetics. Genetic biological reproduction seems to be your God. It is the planner and predeterminer, and can be said to have causative power over all actions.<p>The gene is arbitrary. The gene is ambiguous. The gene is defined by man. Genes and genetic reproduction is but one method for the continued existence of things through time. Humans have defeated the gene. We don't need to die and reproduce several times to store and communicate survival information to our descendent's. We have invented language and can write it in a book.<p>You are stuck in genetic determinism, denying any idea of free will. Not to say free will is a suitable answer either. Both are a naive treatment of the subject of causality.",1285585229

It's not all the journalist's fault though: Most press releases don't cite the actual research properly either.<p>Also, this article is right to call out the desire of news outlets to create controversy, even when there is none. However, more often they tend to just repeat the gushing, enthusiastic statements of the university or charity PR department, with no conception of when and indeed if the research will actually lead to anything in the real world.",1285585209
