Now, things are starting to re-fragment, along with their mobile OS.<p>I'm not an OS X programmer. Anyone know how loosely couple Aqua is from the rest of the OS?

Mint tried replaced my personal finance spreadsheet... Todo apps try to replace my text document todo list.  This product tries to replace my company balance sheet that I have in Google Docs.<p>But I usually run into two problems.  These products are great at first, for a bunch of tasks, but when I want to do something <i>slightly</i> different, I'm screwed.  With a spreadsheet I just add another column.  With something like Indinero, if I need to track something that the system doesn't allow for, I run into a wall and I have to start over with a whole new system.  Massive data headache.<p>The second issue is that with a spreadsheet/text document, I have to type everything in, and manually update things, so I get intimately familiar my data.  With Mint, I connected all my accounts and then promptly forgot it existed.  The spreadsheet, because of the inconvenience of data entry, forces me to manually reckon my finances, which is actually a good thing.<p>I don't know how you get around those issues, but I'd be excited to see a solution.",1283399775

That was sometimes a sign of things to come (the beginning of the end of brushed metal), sometimes not. I wouldn’t read much into it.<p>iTunes is not really the jewel of all of Apple’s applications. At least not anymore. Other applications always seem to have much more polished UIs. Safari is an obvious candidate, all their iWork applications also have pretty nice UIs, as has the iLife suite. Those always seem to be the better OS X citizens.<p>Combine that with the frequent UI blunders in iTunes (usually at least partially straightened out in subsequent updates) and I’m beginning to suspect that their top UI people are not really working on iTunes all that much.<p>I’m not even sure whether Apple likes iTunes. For all we know they think of it as this huge, overly complex burden, a trap in which they themselves ran. iOS doesn’t have one monolithic iTunes app that does everything and that clearly seems to be what Apple should have done on OS X. If they could have a fresh start they might. It’s just that they probably don’t want to make that kind of investment. (Consider also that Apple probably doesn’t want to install half a dozen different applications on some poor, unsuspecting Windows user’s PC just so that it can sync to the newly bought iPod shuffle. One application is quite enough and that already makes a lot of people angry.)",1283399110

Bacteria spores have survived millions of years, temperatures colder than anything on Mars, freeze drying and beyond, whilst still being viable when reanimated by the correct conditions.<p>Find key locations and seed them. Craters and valleys will trap any heat produced by these lichen (via lower albedos and the bacteria themselves) making them ideal locations if their temperatures break freezing. Mars' strong winds will do all the work of spreading the spores into surrounding areas that are habitable, or that may become habitable if the lichens have adequate effect.<p>I fail to see what the harm in trying is aside from a loss of money. However any space launch comes with the expectation that it could fail, any deployment comes with the expectation that it could fail. Failing is part of going to space.

The argument given for limiting wealth creation is that, once bitcoin was  used enough to have real value, the expense for electricity to perform the calculation approaches a higher amount than would be profitable by doing something else... First, not all computers will utilize electricity uniformly to perform the ""calculations"". Some computers are just horribly inefficient. Also, it's certainly possible to construct more power efficient computing devices, and do so without even talking about upcoming nano-technology and processing at the atomic scale which would make electricity costs at a macro scale negligible for even the most hard core computing.

Even if the planet can't support them right now, it could lead to a potentially explosive growth in their population when temperatures hit just right.<p>Considering that the hottest temperature recorded on Mars was 32C, talking like it's a wasted effort is wholly naive considering the survivability of regular bacterium, not to mention the extremeophiles. Cryophiles can reproduce down to -15C and up to above 10C. Radioresistant bacteria can survive 1500 times the dosage of radiation humans can, making Mars a breeze. Similarly there's radiotrophic fungus that actually grow off of ionizing radiation.<p>The biggest concern with viability on Mars is that the regolith has such a high concentration of free radicals that any complex organisms simply could not survive in unprocessed soils. Essentially if we suck our thumbs and wait for the engineering of a super bacteria to survive all the environmental conditions, we're going to have to be engineering it to survive harsher soil conditions than we even know. Whilst bombarding the planet with bacteria and fungus that will only survive in the environment will help us in the long run.<p>It would be advantageous to simply transfer several tons of select bacteria and extremophiles to Mars and colonize areas where temperatures routinely manage to hit above freezing. The lesson people fail to learn is that life doesn't adapt to its environment, it adapts its environment to life.<p>Radiotrophic fungus is a black fungus, if conditions are adequate in this +0C regions for it to thrive, it would slowly decrease the regions albedo (increasing the regions temperature) and allow it a longer reproduction cycle. Similarly landing this in a natural heat-trap like a crater or valley would only dramatically increase the effect.<p>Colonizing Mars is a different story, but we should begin terraforming ASAP. Complex plant life would transform Mars completely within a single persons lifespan, however all complex plant life survives in a mixture of O2 producing and CO2 producing respirations. Until the atmosphere has O2 present in an actual percentage, terraforming will require exceedingly complex greenhouses not necessarily to trap in heat, but to trap in oxygen.<p>You can irrigate countless acres very simply to provide the necessary water, you can't build the necessary domes or greenhouses, etc, that would be needed to trap oxygen.<p>It's simplistic to say, but throwing everything at Mars and seeing what sticks certainly wouldn't hurt, and if you aim it at some good spots, it could even thrive with amazing simplicity on such a complex problem.<p>I mean if we're pissing around imagining bacteria (I've heard of no actual effort to genetically engineer a viable terraforming bacteria, so this is based on assumption) we might as well imagine one that performs self-sustaining electrolysis of rust to release the vast tonnages of sequestered oxygen in the Martian soil.",1283398234

If you want to write for a modern audience then read as many great works of fiction from the last 50 or 100 years as you can. Read the non-fiction too. Read great essays. Read The New Yorker. Then try this...<p>You know how when you go to an art museum you always see art students sitting around sketching some great masterpiece? Do that. When you read a great passage--or hell just open up something by a great author and pick a page--copy it down, word for word, and pay attention while you do it. Now go back through with a different color pen and break it down. How long are the sentences? Does their length vary? How? What letter starts each sentence? Is there alliteration? How is it stressed? And so on.<p>Reading will give you the tools, but like Alex said, you've got to write to get good at writing. Here's what I suggest. Either blog or write a journal every day. Then make it a habit to go back to things you've written (blog or work stuff, whatever) and review it, then revise it. Do that about one or two weeks after you've written it so you have fresh eyes. You'll start to pick up on your common mistakes and learn to correct and avoid them.<p>Above all else, a great writer must develop empathy for the reader.
