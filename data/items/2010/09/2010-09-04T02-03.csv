I'm not going to beat a dead horse, you can look at my comments in the other thread for my thoughts on StarCraft itself, but I'm going to speak generally on RTS:<p>I look at RTS as a sort of dance that eventually becomes a contest to find the better dancer. Even so, the better dancer may lose, and the better dancer may dance better and lose simply because the dance was better losing than winning. A loss has no real-world consequences, and as such, the sort of person I'd like to work with has no fear of losing. Only fear that the game will be uninteresting.

The young couple in the article can't seem to resist the historically low borrowing costs available to them and that renting their place could be an option if they would not be able to sell, should they be required to move.  Question- Does purchasing a home drastically reduce labor mobility as it stands in this country right now?  In other words, if I want to go out to California with a group of three partners to start up a company that I think will have enormous impact and be disruptive to an existing industry, would I be less likely to take such a venture if I thought that an obligation like a mortgage would tie me down?  With the rise in home ownership over the last decade (now in reverse), have we prevented ourselves from geographic mobility because of that dreadful debt burden in a 30 year fixed mortgage?  Richard Florida describes this same issue in his new book, The Great Reset.  I would agree with him that emphasis should not be as great on homeownership (and accompanying tax credits) and instead should be more towards driving new creative technologies and systems that this country needs to compete.",1283568300

The three races are so different and unique, yet balanced. There are so many different ways a game can end; there is a counter to every counter. You have to manage economy. You have to manage army production. Technology upgrades, information reconnaissance, micro-harassment, army positioning.

Obviously it contains one, and people build communication media on top of it, but Apple, as far as I know, doesn't prevent you from making calls to China, or from communicating via any app that is distributed both in China and here in the States. Your provider may charge you a pretty penny, but you're free to do it.<p>Compare that to StarCraft, which represents a vision of a terrifyingly closed Internet, where every nation has its own walled garden and you cannot get out.

1661842,comment,1661594,1661816,0,0,silencio,,,"Indeed. I just recently shopped around and bought a new TV. As someone that had a budget of upwards of $2k, everyone and their mother in every store I went to, including Fry's and Costco, were pushing 3D TVs at me. They all needed $200+ glasses to work (that's just awesome when you have lots of friends over...), were all giving me nothing other than 3D to justify the increased cost, and nobody really mentioned what I already knew: there's a dearth of 3D content out there. I think every store that had a 3D TV I could try out was permanently tuned to either ESPN 3D or the manufacturer's demo video.<p>By the time my new 46"" Samsung LED TV needs replaced (I give it 5 years at the earliest), I bet neither the 3D technology nor the content will have improved significantly. I haven't seen much 3D content that adds rather than detracts in a very uniquely gimmicky way, ever, and I don't see all the studios and manufacturers agreeing to a common set of standards very soon...",1283567985

Thanks for posting that.<p>You didn't really answer my question about a native Mac app, but that may be because you can't talk about anything that may or may not be in development, which is understandable. In any case, just to re-iterate, my customer feedback is that I'd be much happier with Netflix streaming on my Mac if there were a native Mac app that incorporated the iPad implementation of PlayReady, without the need for installing Silverlight. On the bright side, I'm definitely happier with Mac streaming since learning from elq that Netflix supports ""HD"" streams on the Mac since May. I guess I should have subscribed to the official Netflix blog, as I'd have heard about it before yesterday.<p>p.s. Also in that article is this gem:<p><i>In addition, Netflix founder and CEO Reed Hastings sits on the Microsoft board.</i><p>I guess we've hashed this to death already, and you've made good points about the technical merits of Silverlight (version 3, at least, which was not available to the public when Mac streaming was originally released), but given the relationship between Netflix's CEO and Microsoft, you can probably understand why people would be skeptical that the choice to use Silverlight was an engineering-driven decision, which was staunch's point in his original post, I think.<p>At any rate, I think you and elq have made a good argument that as of v3, it's probably a better technical solution than Flash, at least.",1283567855

Give two people similarly situated characters and it might very well come down to experience, skills, and leadership ability.<p>However, the ability to arrive at ""similarly situated characters"" is not distributed in an equitable manner, and that grossly tilts the playing field.  For example, WoW trades advancement for time.  If you've got 720 hours to kill and spent them in the same calendar years as I did, you were going to end up with a level 60 character and a fair amount of gear (with differences depending on your WoW skill, guild, etc, but negligible compared to the differences between a lvl 1 and lvl 60 character).<p>Maybe skills would let you lead a raiding guild taking down what was then ""top content"", maybe they would not.  But if you <i>didn't</i> have 720 hours free, perhaps because you had to work three jobs to keep your children fed, then you weren't going to be leading that raid, regardless of your charming personality or skill with stance dance.<p>(Speaking of stance dance, I have a few years of practice of flipping between Academic Liberal Or At Least Educated By Them and Republican Somewhere To The Right of Atilla The Hun.  Sometimes in the same conversation.)",1283566642
