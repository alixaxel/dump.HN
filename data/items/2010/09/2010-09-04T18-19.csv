I just wanted to use Node as a way of ""pushing"" events down to the browser, but the only way Node will know if an event has happened or not is by polling a particular SOAP service. I do own the SOAP service though, so I suppose that I could add a new interface and let Node just connect with TCP?<p>What's the standard way of doing RPC between Node an other types of services?",1283624358
