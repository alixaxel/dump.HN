Standard Dijsktra only allows lookahead of one node at a time. A star allows you to incorporate a long range heuristic, like Euclidean distance from current node to destination. This gives a lower bound on current candidate path length and allows you to discard bad paths more rapidly.<p>Note that in all cases you need some basis for this heuristic (eg lat/lng of each node). Also, while 2D maps/nodes as cities is a great way to build your intuition for the algorithm, you can generalize it to arbitrary node types as long as heuristic function gives a good lower bound.",1283741516

But there needs to be something else to make things ""go bad"", and for it to be a significant problem it needs to happen quickly, before people can adjust their debt levels based on economic signals like an increasing unemployment rate.<p>A very sudden collapse in commodity demand from China <i>could</i> cause a crisis like that, but a sudden drop like that seems unlikely to me. (If you disagree, explain what you think happens in China to cause such a rapid change)<p>A more likely scenario seems to be a slow decrease in demand, occurring over many years. A slow slowdown in demand allows people to change their debt levels, and while individuals may have problems it is unlikely to cause a huge crisis beyond a higher unemployment rate.<p>Given Australia got through the biggest financial crisis since the 1920's in pretty good shape I think automatic pessimism is unfounded.",1283738939

I'm Tommi from Rocket Pack and I thought I'd chime in here with a reply.<p>Yes, games made with Unity are currently still accepted into the App Store but fact is that Unity does stand in violation with the TOS, and the plug COULD be pulled at any moment. If you, as an app developer/company, are ok with that risk then go right ahead! We clearly state that the status is uncertain, not that games are not currently accepted.<p>About the MMO features in Unity - we are talking about server side things in the chart (should probably clarify that). Right now Unity only offers RPC calls between clients via P2P without a centralised server, which means you'd need to develop a backend for running an MMO. You would also not be able to run the same code on the server (and possibly not even the same language). So needless to say that a LOT of extra work would be needed in order to even start an MMO project with in Unity. Also the requirement of a plugin (if the game is a browser title) would severely hamper potential user base. I'd say that the comparison is definitely fair as we offer both RPCs, parameter reflection and have an entire backend solution that is specifically designed to run the server side of your game with minimal effort. It also offers analytics, social identity handling, leaderboards and a lot of other services out of the box.<p>Don't get me wrong, I love Unity but its areas of utilization are kinda different from Rocket Engine's. We excel at browser games, MMOs and handheld web apps, whereas Unity is much more geared towards traditional 3d gaming.<p>Nevertheless, thanks for the feedback, and I'm glad to see such an active discussion here! :)<p>-Tommi Kiviniemi, Rocket Pack",1283738870

Tuition is the way to make up the for the loss of state support.<p>Tenure is not why colleges cost so much.  Most teachers are not tenured and tenure is becoming less and less prevalent.
