Of course, many Americans who are <i>not</i> otherwise intelligent are just as bad. People get indoctrinated in a certain political viewpoint and don't have the ability to take on good faith anyone who disagrees with them. As a result of this, it's so difficult to find someone capable of intelligently and thoughtfully discussing political issues that it's rarely worth it.",1283803085

1667297,comment,1666738,1667150,0,0,jacobolus,,,"No, no, a thousand times no to your whole outlook here. If powerful general APIs are provided, people will build the (hopefully open source even) abstractions on top which wrap those up in cute, easy-to-read, easy-to-use bundles of functionality. JavaScript should have access to some real binary data type, should have some general APIs for doing fast math on those types, should have direct-ish access to APIs like cryptography and data compression, &c.<p>The reason that the web is built on a giant pile of hacky taped-together spaghetti (to mangle some metaphors) is that instead of providing access to real low-ish level features, every browser has had its own special set of half-baked high-level APIs and leaky abstractions.<p>So, for example, I hope that WebSocket stays as simple as possible, the way it is now (the way Ian Hickson argues for it to stay), instead of sprouting complex authentication, encryption, specialized compression, various multiplexing and tricky framing features, &c. &c. on top (as the Java community and the IETF mailing list on the subject keep bickering about).<p>The worst thing that can happen for the language and its community of developers is to continue to be treated as second-class novices who need our hands held and must be guided through APIs providing the precise features envisioned by some enlightened browser vendor. If instead we’re treated like adults, there are plenty of really really smart JavaScript coders who will be happy to experiment with abstractions on top of the language and give the high-level website developers awesome tools, which can evolve and grow over time. We should be making it possible in the language John Resig to build jQuery and processing.js, rather than making it easy for Joe Random Developer to access some specific high level thing in as few lines as possible.",1283803011

1667295,comment,1667060,1667207,0,0,Anechoic,,,"One of my college professors was an outspoken opponent of missile defense systems (and the Patriot system specifically) that worked during the missile's reentry/descent phase.<p>His objection is that it's too easy for an opponent to defeat the system either by overwhelming it (MIRVs for instance) or by designing the reentry vehicle to make random movements which would make it really difficult for a intercepter to track. Even if the interceptor can hit it, it's more likely to knock the warhead off course instead of destroying it. If a nuclear missile is aimed at NY and an interceptor hits it so that it falls to Philly instead, that's still a net loss.<p>Saddam inadvertently hit upon the both methods - his engineers tried to improve on the Soviet scud design to give them more range (which they were successful at) but their improvements made the missile more likely to break up on reentry (which presented more targets than the tracking radar anticipated) and the lack of aerodynamics of the resulting pieces (including the warhead) the missiles fall in unpredictable ways which caused tracking problems. An opponent that actually <i>tried</i> to game the system could make his missiles more difficult to hit.<p>The professor is advocating for boost-phase missile defense since the missile movements are much more predicable.",1283802981

If you stay and get screwed, you will still eventually leave, and then you will think about two things:<p>a) How stupid you feel for letting a company walk all over you. Like, ""Aren't I smart enough to avoid those traps?"" (Answer: only after you've fallen into them once or twice.)<p>b) Eventually, you'll appreciate the wisdom earned from failure. I worked for 4.5 years as employee zero, with little in the way of appreciation from my employer (not just material). I saw many things I now recognize as hallmarks of mismanagement. As much as I felt like a heel for not having the gumption to quit, I earned a great deal of experience that I rely on daily.<p>So -- if you end up staying, and you end up like me -- it's not all roses, but it's not all thorns either. Knowing what you don't want in an employer is often as valuable as knowing what you do want.<p>A final aside: there was no malice at my old company.

1667271,comment,1666080,1666080,0,0,hackerr,,,"Interesting observation. Though it demands what exactly is considered repression and the degree to which it is done. Person's memories are  malleable over the time. A memory of an event 10 years back <i>will</i> be modified over the course of 10 years based on other events during that period. Rashomon Effect is not just among people or in a society, it also applies to a person and his internal loop.  Also - correct me if I am wrong here - degree of repression if any also depends on the age (and thus mental setup of the person then) of person involved. There may be memories of trauma a 4 year old  may have endured and long forgotten by his conscious mind but may surface in the form of unnatural phobias/fears. But as mentioned before, it is not hard for someone to plant an idea into someone else's mind or tamper with his/her memory and inject false ideas, particularly in a patient-doctor relationship.<p>Conclusion: Basing legal judgements or decisions purely on a person's memory is wrong. Our insight into memory is not deep enough to be making such decisions. Diagnosing a person who may be experiencing depression/fears purely based on his own memories sounds absurd.",1283802163

I'm very skeptical of its ""generality"", though, once you get away from anything that's vaguely similar to chess. For example, try writing Starcraft in GDL (even a discretized version); it's not impossible, but I sure wouldn't want to do it, and the result wouldn't be tractably usable by any GGP engines either. I'm working on a project currently that needs a logical representation of videogames, but I'm not using GDL, because it's just a pain in the ass for videogames (and I want an internal time axis also, not a state-transition system).<p>But mostly I was thinking on the playing side: I don't think any of the current GGP approaches can even come <i>close</i> to playing strategy-type video games, because they don't typically have any real notion of, as you mention, similarity between situations, or a decomposition into hierarchical or interrelated concerns. A Starcraft bot that treated Dragoon microcontrol as an equivalent-level problem to build order probably isn't going to do well. I think the robotics community might actually have a better starting point: architectures with interrelated components like SLAM, planning, motor control, etc., as opposed to trying to turn the ""robotics problem"" into one giant state space to be navigated by one giant algorithm. Trying to build an agent that plays two quite different strategy games well (Starcraft and Planet Wars) might be one way of driving the development of those kinds of decompositions.",1283801178

I don't care what the books or the authors say, agile is about optimizing your particular team for your particular situation. There's not a one-size-fits-all cookbook.<p>The only caveat I'll add is this: many times people won't believe (or do not understand) that certain things will actually make them run faster and have a happier team. So you have to have an open mind. If you already know agile sucks, it's probably going to suck. If you already know that agile means TDD and everything done a certain way? It's probably going to suck a lot. In fact, the ones that think they know agile (and love it and are willing to tell everybody they hear about it) are usually the ones making life miserable on everybody else. I'd much rather have honest skeptics. With skeptics you can try something and decide whether you like it or not. In the ""agilistas"" minds, unless you do it perfectly, you are sinning against agile and it's no wonder you are struggling. They can be impossible to live with. (and they've lost track of the big picture)<p>Or as I told one team, I've never had a team fail because of the way they decided to do (or not do) story points.

I just thought that is was interesting that the shape of a planet doesn't affect its trajectory under the laws of gravity alone (i.e. no collisions etc). It's also true that physicists do use explicit approximations often, for example in statistical mechanics, or by using a linear approximation instead of an exact quantity. That's similar to calculating the asymptotic running time of an algorithm instead of the exact number of steps it takes (except the limit in the physics case takes some quantity to zero to get a linear approximation whereas for the algorithm we take the limit of the input data size to infinity).",1283800277

If a second 2kg weight were added to the ""anchor"" end of the spring balance - it would either register -1kg (if it's built to do that) or break or lock up givinging invalid or useless readings.  
Of course - assuming the balance isn't anchored anywhere else, this would set the whole system in motion, and it would all fall apart ratherquickly.",1283800239
