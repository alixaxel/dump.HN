Mann, a global finance professor at the Brandeis University International Business School who studies the outsourcing of jobs.

Ruby on Rails is relatively obscure. Scaling web sites is relatively obscure. I bet there is a latency, probably inversely proportional to market size, between when a specialized tech skill is originated and when it has disseminated sufficiently that it can be outsourced.<p>So, there can be a simultaneous shortage and surplus: a shortage of talented developers working with recent technology, and a surplus of talented (and otherwise) developers who are only familiar with older technology.",1283824690

The value in this situation is those companies that can sort, aggregate, or point you in the right content direction (HN fits this group; so does Google).<p>But then there's the fact, and this article makes the point, that without content there's no value. Whether user-generated, expert-driven or otherwise, we do need some content, and no doubt some content is far more valuable than others.<p>My strength is undoubtedly in created meaningful content. Does that make me valuable, with the right connections, or a sucker with skills that are soon to be comparable to blacksmithing in NYC or making cars in Detroit?",1283821625

Letting things go is the best way to handle most strong emotions, even strong positive emotions can cause you difficulties if you act on them.
