The problem is that this will result in even more financial engineering. The government basically doubled the amount of informaiton that loan underwriters have to take when writing loans. It even requires information such as how far the recipient lives from their primary work place (in the case of home loans).<p>That kind of information is not easy to come by and it's certainly not easy to incorporate into an analysis. It raises the cost to the loan underwriter, to the loan issuer, to the securitization underwriter, which ultimately goes full circle back to the end consumer (credit card rates are already at 15 year highs due to the Dodd bill). There is also another side effect, this legislation, pariticularly as it pertains to securitizations which fund the majority of home loans and consumer debt, will facilitate further complex financial engineering (the more data you have, the more you're likely to use it). It will also give certain funds the opportunity to discern demographic information, which is currently not ""technically"" possible but will be a lot easier to do once the flood of data comes in from issuers. What i'm hinting at is that institutional speculators and investors will be able to discriminate against pools by analying income, location of workplace, years of employment (another factor), income history etc.<p>I may be ranting so I'll cut short here. Long story short, the costs of banking are about to sky high for everyone.

Perhaps we're only even in contention because 400 people before us said, ""screw that!""<p>In short, is an award you have to pay to receive worth winning?

It was a desert before as well. The Sumerians used irrigation to be able to turn dry but fertile soil into farmland. This requires a lot of hard work, ingenuity, and collaboration, which might be why civilization started there. It's relatively flat, with a hard subsurface, which makes salt buildup a problem, making farming there rather more fragile.<p>If what you are saying is true, then why is there still farming after thousands of years along the Nile and Indus river valleys?<p>In any case, what do you suggest the people of L.A. do? They grow a lot of their food locally, in the Central Valley, but that water is pumped from across the state and the Valley has the same problems as the Fertile Crescent.<p>Should they grow the food in their backyards (more locally), and if so, will there be separate water systems for crops, because it needs less water treatment than humans need?<p>Or should some large fraction of the population move, and if so, where?
