1663762,comment,1663619,1663619,0,0,nickpinkston,,,"His thesis of structural problems being a large part of the crisis (rather than simple systemic risk) is probably true though. The ""fire"" instead of ""hire and fire"" partially reflects that the unemployed aren't useful to employers. Yes, a sizable chunk is due to lower production due to the recession.<p>Remember how this is the ""man-cession""? This means construction and manufacturing. Productivity is up (and not only because people work harder to not lose jobs) due to a well-needed gutting due to having a good excuse. This is some painful creative destruction.<p>Instead of pouring money out piecemeal, stimulus needs to address the structural issues: modernizing the workforce/education system, rearranging (cut/add) regulations, and useful infrastructure (e.g. not just fixing potholes).",1283648181

My sons keep emphasizing the aspects of the games they introduce me to that are ""like Simcity"" -- ie the infrastructure development parts which are critical to supporting a good military force and that this is actually a bigger part of some of these games than the fighting per se.  Then they sit with me and coach me sometimes so I don't get thrown to the wolves.  We recently started a website together in part to talk about games ...well, that doesn't do it justice but it will have to do for now.  So I am, actually working on stuff.

It seems Apple's strategy is that the Apple TV is a ""dumb box"", like a modem for your TV, that allows other devices (computers) to talk to it. They don't want to add an App store, because then it wouldn't be a ""dumb box"" any more.<p>The Apple TV is as cheap as it is now because they're targeting the market segment that doesn't care about anything other than watching movies, listening to music, and looking at pictures. These people won't comparison-shop based on the internal processor speed, or the hard disk capacity.<p>Apple got stuck in a spec race with the iPhone, and they don't want to have to do it again with the Apple TV, because spec races inevitably up prices—more speed, more capability, more storage—when what they want the ATV to be is a <i>commodity</i> that every TV has hooked up to it, so people can use their <i>computers</i> (specifically, their <i>Apple</i> computers) to stream things to them.<p>They want the ATV to do <i>as little</i> as possible, not as much as possible, just to act as a little adapter that brings your TV into your wi-fi network. It's not part of their computer or phone businesses; rather, it an extension of the ""ubiquitous networking"" strategy they've always had with the Airport Express (in fact, I bet the Airport Express and Apple TV teams are now merged under the ""AirPlay"" banner.)",1283646763

The girl will audition, they get accepted and then they pay a house fee (usually around $100) to work there.  Sundays are typically house fee free.  Everything else is based on tips and the girls have to tip everyone: bouncers, house moms, makeup (if they don't do their own).<p>And it's really a scaling issue.  I'm guessing (and I'm just guessing) that the median income for a stripper in a particular area is directly related to the median income for that area.<p>Also, a lot of girls travel to work, between NYC, Vegas and Los Angeles.  Also, Miami is pretty big.<p>You don't need to be a super model to work at the ""top flight"" clubs in NYC either.  I have photographic evidence of that.  You do need to have some hustle to make a lot of money though, and a casual disdain for men doesn't hurt either.<p>I would most certainly NOT recommend it as a career for people.  I think it has the capability of ruining healthy sexual attitudes in people.  It certainly made my relationship much harder.<p>That being said, a lot of these girls have very few options that provide the sort of income and lifestyle flexibility that stripping offers.  My ex-wife supported her entire family with it.  Could she have done something else?  Maybe, but she didn't finish high school and her family required her support.  What career can someone in her situation take on that offers 90K+ for 4 days work without a high school diploma?<p>It's really interesting too because the entire perception of stripping is so culturally rooted.  Where she is from (Japan) it's no big deal.  It's another job, like being a hostess girl.  Not something you wear on your sleeve, but not something you necessarily are ashamed of.

I'm sure it was read because it seriously clashes with the NY state of mind, but I saw some pretty supportive comments on Twitter from Californians and New Yorkers alike. I would never want my office to be in France where you get to work at 11, go to lunch and have a few bottles of wine from 12-4, and then take off at 5. I'm glad Sarkozy raised the retirement age to 62 though. I just don't want a culture swap, but it looks to be one of the many directions our melting pot could take. My french roommate used to put the eggs in the cupboard! Crazy!<p>If I saw one of my employees put the eggs in the cupboard and then take a nap in my New York office, my brain would implode.<p>I'm not suggesting to operate like a sweatshop and I'm aware that manufacturing power in the United States is quite volatile right now, but even when people focus on those right-brain activities, the earth still spins and capitalism still exists. Some of my best work is produced when my fatigue becomes delusion :D",1283645292

1663694,comment,1663619,1663619,0,0,zeteo,,,"I can't really evaluate the article on economic terms, but it fails miserably in its knowledge of history. If we are to believe prof. Straubhaar, in the 20th century ""[t]he United States rose rapidly from virtually nothing to become the most politically powerful and economically strongest country in the world"", by following the economics of some fuzzily defined American Way where ""every man was responsible for himself -- in good times and bad. No one could count on government assistance"".<p>Then the good professor argues for a return to these good old times. The historical reality begs to differ. Far from being ""virtually nothing"", the US manufacturing output was the first in the world as early as 1890:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_United_States#The_Gilded_Age:_1865.E2.80.931900"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_history_of_the_United_...</a><p>This economic growth was, by the way, happening behind some pretty heavy protectionist measures (initiated by none other than Lincoln):<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_in_American_history#Civil_War_protective_policy.2C_1861-1913"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff_in_American_history#Civi...</a><p>But maybe this economics professor wasn't referring to economic output? Let's look at the principles that guided Franklin Delano Roosevelt, under whose leadership the US became acknowledged as a military superpower as well:<p>""Throughout the nation men and women, forgotten in the political philosophy of the Government, look to us here for guidance and for more equitable opportunity to share in the distribution of national wealth""<p>A complete opposite from the article's description of an ideology where ""no one could count on government assistance""!<p>In conclusion, the article's premises are based on a very shaky foundation and expose a shocking ignorance (for an economics professor, at least) of US history. And if the foundation is bad, I don't think the rest of the edifice hold up very well either.",1283645008
