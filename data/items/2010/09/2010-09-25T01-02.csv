1726083,comment,1725906,1725906,0,0,baddox,,,"Your choice to make your information public is not a privacy issue.  Sure, for the naïve (average) user, networks like facebook should provide explicit and honest disclaimers, intuitive customization, and conservative defaults.  Beyond that, facebook only has information you choose to make public, and they shouldn't be expected to not use that information.  If a random person on facebook can look you up and see your favorite music, then I don't consider any different if advertisers utilize that information (either by scraping it themselves or by purchasing ads through facebook) to target ads.<p>Granted, you can make the valid argument that information can be mined without you explicitly providing it (e.g. friend graphs).  That's an iffy ethical argument that is up for debate: is deriving information about someone from public information an invasion of that person's privacy?  For example, if you walk out your front door and drive your car away, it's obvious that a neighbor witnessing that has not invaded your privacy.  However, if the neighbor noticing you leaving and returning on a regular schedule, and learns that a local strip club has a weekly special event that corresponds to your outings, has the acquisition of that information (whether or not you're actually going to the club) constituted an invasion of your privacy?",1285379927

1726081,comment,1725586,1725586,0,0,rubypay,,,"Just saw this post about our startup, I'll clarify some things since some people seem interested.<p>RubyPay was a points based payment system for digital content that anyone could use. Points were bought for cash, and redeemable for cash.  It was released because we wanted to generate some feedback on the model.<p>RubyPay was closed so quickly because we realized some problems, and didn't want any live transactions going through our system that we'd later have to refund.  Among some of the problems were:<p>1) allowing anyone to sell content without a screening process for them or the content<p>2) allowing consumers to redeem the points for cash, which brought a whole new set of laws into play<p>3) not anticipating all of the ways that fraud could propagate through the system<p>We're currently working on the service to address these and other issues.  We've also discussed the business further with lawyers, became PCI-DSS compliant, and are in the process of forming industry partnerships.  As always thanks for the feedback (there was another discussion thread on HN too), it helped us quickly pivot and iterate on our model, and probably saved us tons of time and headaches.",1285379597

Unfortunately this is not very useful since there are a multiple things that can only be done on twitter.com and not in 3rd party clients, either because the functionality is missing from the API or is broken (they started to fix some of these though). So even if people use a 3rd party client most of the time, they would still log into twitter.com every once in a while and thus will be counted as a twitter.com user.<p>A more useful statistics would be the percentage of users who use any given client as their main way of interacting with Twitter. Of course twitter.com would still be the biggest client, but not with 78% of all users, more likely somewhere between 40-50% (based on stats by twittersource.info, tdash.org and stats of Hungarian users I've collected).<p>As for the original post, we're running a web-based client and twitter.com is one of the most important referers so I'll have to agree that removing the ""via client"" attribution will hurt developers in a big way.

I have seen job offers from LA shops ranging from $18k-$60k range. This entire range is very very silly.<p>Developers and engineers are professionals. Living in a one room apartment or in someone's basement are not acceptable options. Salary needs to cover the cost of a single family house.<p>A decent house in a safe neighborhood in LA runs from $400,000 to $2 million. Yes, you can buy in the barrio for much less. You can also rent decently and that is what most in LA do.

All I am saying is that recruitment is difficult from outside the area because nearly all developers are asked to take a huge hit on their standard of living when moving there. LA recruiters feel the low rates are justified because living in LA is considered itself to be a valuable benefit. Most people outside the area do not see it that way however.<p>Having lived in both areas, if a company in LA is really offering bay area salaries which are $110k-$170k, then yes, they are paying market rate.

The losses get allocated to the riskier pieces of the deal which protects the lower interest rate/more ""protected"" higher pieces of the deal.<p>Also banks got bailouts which cushion them against losses but do not prevent losses.

Furthermore, the entire premise of the argument relies on looking at number of boys below a certain level. That's fine in it's own right, but they seem to assume this means boys are overall worse at reading, when no evidence has been presented to support this claim, and every study I have read about male intelligence indicates that it has higher variance than females.<p>This man seems obsessed with imposing his arbitrary and unnatural social views upon boys. He denounces the natural desire for boys to be active, negatively calling upon the properties of 'squirminess'. And we sit to wonder why America is expected to be 75% obese people in a few years, when activity is denounced?<p>The author then reveals his complete ignorance when he cites one study demonstrating correlation between media consumption in boys to academic progress as Scientific Fact that his claims are accurate. To quote, ""Hard to believe, isn't it, but Science has spoken."" Yet, he ignores two very important parts of Science - experiments must be repeated, and correlation != causation. He steps through magical logical leaps that somehow playing video games makes your children illiterate and that the solution to illiteracy is removing anything interesting that is not a book, when there are in fact several simpler explanations supported by much more repeated research reflecting child development patterns. I am sure he does not want to accept this 'barbaric' view, but boys have a tendency to learn more effectively through trial and error, and develop their analytical (as he might call it, 'civilized') language skills later. Boys are learning about the world around them by pushing the boundaries to see how it reacts - no matter how much it upsets this author's view on how civilized people should act. Those boys not held back by imbeciles like him will grow up to become Engineers and Scientists, spending a little time in their day to use their superior literacy and reasoning skills to retort people such as the author here.<p>A boy raised on the stimulating electronic media of infinite possibility, will imagine - and create - the future that narrow-minded president's of publishing companies could never think of, but take for granted anyway.",1285376906
