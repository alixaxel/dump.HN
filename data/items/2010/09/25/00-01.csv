One of the story links indicates that Toxie was connected to a known case.<p>A realtor flipped a property back and forth between friends multiple times, it being sold for a higher price each time.  The banks were happy to make the loans on the property that was increasing in value.  The people involved shared the gains along the way, then the last one defaulted.  The selling back and forth could happen normally... it seems the fraud was in the parties obtaining loans for an owner occupied property.  It was apparently empty the whole time.<p>These people didn't need an economic downturn to default.

1725970,comment,1725586,1725897,0,0,jasonlotito,,,"> The banks only want to drop you if you're attracting too many charge-backs, fraud, or money laundering. If you have a good system in place to minimize these problems, they will gladly take their processing fee from each and every transaction you process and they will do it with a smile.<p>Wrong.  I know this first hand.  First, ""banks"" do not decide whether you process or not.  People do, and these people are, in my experience, fairly corrupt.  Most people don't deal with the banks directly, but even if they do, the agents their aren't just dealing with you.  All it takes is for you and a competitor to end up using the same bank, and if that competitor is bigger than you, they can push you out.<p>It's not difficult.<p>I've been on the receiving end of this.  I've heard it all.  I've had the agent on the phone, and wouldn't answer the question regarding which transaction they were claiming was against their policy.  A few weeks later, after closing us down, the send us the information for a transaction that occurred after they shut us down, claiming that was why we were closed.<p>Chargeback levels?  Well below the threshold.  We had practically no actual fraudulent transactions, and more than 95% of the transactions that were pending chargebacks were friendly fraud (authorized card holder claiming a chargeback).<p>I'm not talking about some small time shop.  We were pumping 8 figures through our banks at our prime, all as legit as we could make it (which at the time, was far more secure than most other processors at the time).<p>Your sentiments are right.  The banks are interested in money, and if you are bringing in the transactions, they'll process.  Unfortunately, if you're a small fish in a big pond (and yes, a small fish processing in the 10s of millions a year), and a bigger fish wants you put down, the bank will take the work to keep the big fish happy.<p>And if it sounds like I'm pissed, it's because I am.  It's working so hard for so many years, pushing forth so many cool things, just to see it collapse.  Not because you did anything wrong, but because someone maliciously screwed you over.<p>That's why I avoid looking at anything as a startup that forces me to rely on a single point of failure.  Working with Visa and MasterCard puts you under their control.  Sure, accepting money online puts you at their mercy as well, but it's not the same as building your business being an actual processor.<p>Anyways, I've rambled on long enough.  Don't take offense if I caused any.  That wasn't my intent.",1285375967

Writing Twitter apps and clients is a pretty competitive space (whether rational or not).<p>Back in the olden days of Basic Auth, you would email one of the API devs at Twitter and get a special source token to put in your code for client attribution. Then, Twitter said you couldn't get a source token any more and had to use OAuth to specify your client source. This was one of the main carrots they dangled in front of developers to get them to switch to OAuth before the Basic Auth shut off; ""Use OAuth so that your client source will show on the website.""<p>It would be one thing if it felt like a snub, but now it feels like a bait and switch.<p>Disclosure: I've written several twitter apps and worked on the Twitter API team as a contractor for a bit last year.",1285374370

They also don't have very good customer service. For years their phone number was hidden 10 pages deep where no one could find it. They freeze your account and hide from you.<p>A while back they ran into some trouble with the bank that was sponsoring their merchant account, they had to quickly make changes to keep processing.<p>Instead of spending money to improve their fraud/risk algorithm, they just lowered the threshold that triggers an account freeze, which helps with fraud but also drastically increases the number of false-positives, which they consider acceptable collateral damage.<p>They aren't even nice about it. Why tell me my account is ""frozen""? Why can't they say ""Congratulations on the recent spike in transactions. Your business must be doing well and we are delighted to hear that! Please give us a call when you can so we can go over some additional documentation that we will need from you"".<p>Think about this: PayPal freezes your account, which brings your business to a halt, then you have to scramble to fix it. PayPal doesn't need to freeze your account, they can just as easily prevent you from withdrawing money to your bank account, which sucks but it probably won't kill your business. At least your customers can still pay you.
