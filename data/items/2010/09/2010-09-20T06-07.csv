That's not sufficient, unless you have an oracle that can tell you if each checkin will work just fine.</i><p>I don't know what Microsoft's code review policy is.  It would surprise me if they forced code review before allowing developers to check code in.  It would fit my expectations if they do code review before merging branches together.  But those are educated guesses based on the industry as a whole, and could both be far off base.<p>That said, I agree that manual code review is not sufficient.  Nor are automated unit tests.  Both help and are important pieces, but you need other pieces as well to make this work.<p><i>One big problem I see:<p>When you're working on a feature you don't want a thousand of checkins per day coming in. As some checkin downstream, that doesn't directly effect your feature can end up blocking you. For example, I'm working on the start menu button, but some random guy checks in some new feature that broke the ATI Radeon 9850x video card, which happens to be the video card you're using. Now I'm blocked for a day.</i><p>Why would you think that you are blocked for a day?  Implicit in there is an assumption that there is a nightly build process, giving you a one day feedback loop.  In that case if the nightly build is broken, you're in trouble.  And with a day of check-ins, this is likely to happen a lot of days.<p>To that assumption I'll reply that if you wish to use an iterative development process, you need to make iterations and feedback as quick as possible.  See <a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/articles/continuousIntegration.html</a> for some advice on how to do that.  Also look to your build tools.  For instance something like <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/distcc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/distcc/</a> can let your builds go <i>MUCH</i> faster, which means that the gap between ""oops"" and ""all better"" can be much shorter.<p>Is this all simple to set up?  No.  Not at all.  But it is doable, and I believe it is very much worthwhile in practice.",1284963211
