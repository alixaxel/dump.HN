1655121,comment,1654898,1654898,0,0,jsankey,,,"To me it sounds like the success of NitWiki was down to the culture of the 30-person team.  I'm guessing this stemmed from some leaders in that group, and applied to more than just the wiki.  I'm not sure that much has changed over time - it's just not trivial to cultivate the right kind of culture.<p>Re: the public vs private debate, if you want to make a great public wiki, then maybe you have to make ""open"" the default.  This requires letting go of the fear of sharing too much, although my personal experience suggests we tend to be more afraid of this than is necessary (e.g. ""stealth mode"" startups).",1283396214

1655103,comment,1654660,1654660,0,0,brc,,,"Yawn. All a bit 1998 if you ask me.  Look, I found most of it terribly visually impressing in a rock-video type of way.<p>When I can eat or live in a piece of information, then I'll start buying new paradigms with my ears pinned back.<p>All this talk about new economy is a bit old.  While I'm impressed about the presentation - that's a very impressive way of showing things - and I agree that command-and-control architecture is done and dusted by sharing and open information models - this whole thing about information being more important than factories is a bit far-fetched.<p>Perhaps for some growth areas of the economy a completely information-based perspective is not only vital, but valid.  Maybe more millionaires and billionaires will be minted by clever use of information and digital data.  But the majority of the worlds production and income will still be found in digging things around.<p>However, the 'old economy' business of digging things up out of the ground, planting plants and harvesting them, and melting down base minerals to make things from is not going to change.  You can layer all types of fancy new diagrams on top of this, but it's not going to change the base.<p>The big indicator should be that the 3 foundations of the current system, as described in the presentation - can all be exchanged for each other.  Land for Captial, Capital for Labour, Labour for Land.  Try exchanging information for any of these, you won't have much luck, unless we're talking trade secrets or blackmail.  Try exchanging open information for a piece of land and see how you get on.<p>Even an iPad has to be made out of stuff dug out of the ground and refined in some way, then shipped across the ocean in an ancient old bit of technology called a ship.  That's where the real story in the world economy is, that's where it will remain.  Moving information around is just playing with the surplus production given to us by efficient manufacturing and agriculture.<p>If you want the real story on where things are headed, you'd best study things like the baltic dry index, the yield curve and old economy indicators like that.  Measuring things in terms of eyeballs, mindshare and information flow is as terminally ridiculous now as it was 10 years ago when this was discredited the first time around.",1283395668

1655090,comment,1654789,1654920,0,0,city41,,,"I assume there is more to it than that. MS Money's debt planner started with you creating a budget. From there it knows about how much extra you have each month. It then takes in how much debt you have and their interest rates, and from there it plots out how much to pay each debt every month. It's encouraging because you can see the graph converging towards zero, and it also indicates how much you'll save in interest charges versus just paying the minimum (which for a lot of people is probably quite a bit). MS Money is the sole tool that got me out of a lot of debt, and it conditioned me to be responsible with my money ever since.<p>As for weight loss, there pretty much <i>are</i> sites like that. fitday.com, livestrong.com, etc. None of them are magic pills, just like ready for zero won't be.
