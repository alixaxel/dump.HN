I want to be social and party and so on.""<p>Here's the thing you have to understand:  the ideas of introversion and extraversion that you hear are usually a bit of an oversimplification.  <i>Everyone</i> has an introverted and extraverted side.  It's just that one of them is always dominant.<p>With that in mind, there's nothing wrong with developing your extraverted side.  But it sounds like you're trying to change from being an introvert to an extravert which is futile.  I know that I (as an introvert) wouldn't be able to handle a fraternity:  I'd simply be too drained by the experience.<p>Instead, learn to enjoy being introverted and engage your extraverted side from time to time.

So many of the comments seem superficial (something a good copyeditor might simply fix, later in the process). He seems to be a good sport in responding, though.<p>And will his developmental editor at O'Reilly use this interface? Or can public scrutiny stand in for editorial oversight, and the 'true' editing will be minimal? Perhaps a new model for book publishers.<p>Is there a post mortem written anywhere by authors who have used a public commenting feedback system like this (The Django Book, Real World Haskell, among others)? I'm curious if it would be helpful or mostly annoying to authors.<p>I wonder if the commenting system itself encourages trivial,  nitpicky corrections rather than big picture feedback.",1284356667

1685690,comment,1685471,1685471,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"When I started college (I'm an Engineer), I was relatively extroverted, but definitely not a partier or drinker. I wanted to make some of the same changes you discuss, so I rushed a couple fraternities and made a lot of friends. I got bids from 3 fraternities but didn't go with any of them, because in the end, as much as I liked the people, the fraternity lifestyle just didn't jive with my independence.<p>I was still able to become well-entrenched in the social scenes, because I participated in a lot of extra-curricular activities: Formula SAE, Mobile Robotics, WKUF 97.3FM, The Muse (our art publication), DEX (collegiate marketing competition), Firebirds Car Club, started a rock band, etc. These are all things that interested me, and I met a lot of friends, across all fraternities and sororities and independents, who shared these interests.<p>My point is this: there are a lot of ways to make friends, be social, and party. Don't sell yourself short by thinking that a fraternity is the only path. There are a lot of good reasons to join a fraternity outside of the social/party aspect, those are the things you should be considering. If a fraternity seems right to you, then do it. If not, don't worry, there are other ways.<p>EDIT: Also, I wouldn't worry about ""catching up"" socially. Just try to enjoy yourself. And remember that everyone (and I mean EVERYONE) has something to teach you. Make it your mission to figure out what that is (and yes, this will be harder with some people than others).",1284356526

You will have a much better college experience if you say, join the Campus Radio because you like music and everyone else is there because they like music. In most greek fraternities, there is usually zero shared interest why you're there. It's an institution with no core purpose or function other than guaranteeing its own survival by luring in more freshmen. At least the large monolithic bureaucratic organizations in our society exist to fulfill some purpose, however inefficiently.<p>In business, you choose your associates carefully and don't spend time with people who bring down your focus and energy. Rushing a fraternity is the opposite of choosing your associates carefully. It's taking a big risk on who your going to be stuck with for the next 4 years and gambling away your identity.<p>When you commit yourself to a time intensive organization or social group, it becomes your identity to everyone else (like it or not). If you want to live a self-aware life, only commit your time and identity to organizations whose function and purpose you passionately believe in.<p>If you are doing it to party, rest assured other campus organizations will party just as much.

What do I need to learn and how?<p>A few things:<p>1) Think before you talk/act, aka, don't do anything stupid/embarrassing. I see so many guys just blurt shit out that they think is funny, but actually makes people (girls) feel super uncomfortable.<p>2) Be nice. Always. Don't be condescending or every try and look down on others. Be polite and a gentleman. Don't try and be some macho dick head guy like alot of the other frat guys are. The more you help your brothers out (as well as other fraternity guys) the more they will have your back.<p>3) Figure out who some of the most well liked guys in the fraternity are, watch them, learn from them. Emulate (not imitate) and build on the things they say and do.<p>4) Be confident, but not cocky.<p>5) Careful on the drinking and such. Start off in smaller groups so you can get the hang of it. Once you know how much you can tolerate, then you can start drinking in larger groups and start letting lose.<p>6) Chicks are really starting to dig nerds, as long as your cool about it. Embrace it, just don't go overboard with it.<p>BTW, your obviously not truly an introvert, otherwise you probably would be having the urges to change.

He only spoke to his female servants by notes and formed no close personal relationships outside his family. By one account, Cavendish had a back staircase added to his house in order to avoid encountering his housekeeper because he was especially shy of women. His only social outlet was the Royal Society Club, whose members dined together before weekly meetings. Cavendish seldom missed these meetings, and was profoundly respected by his contemporaries. However his shyness made those who ""sought his views... speak as if into vacancy. If their remarks were...worthy, they might receive a mumbled reply.""<p>Because of his asocial and secretive behaviour, Cavendish often avoided publishing his work, and much of his findings were not even told to his fellow scientists. In the late nineteenth century, long after his death, James Clerk Maxwell looked through Cavendish's papers and found things for which others had been given credit. Examples of what was included in Cavendish's discoveries or anticipations were Richter's Law of Reciprocal Proportions, Ohm's Law, Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures, principles of electrical conductivity (including Coulomb's Law), and Charles's Law of Gases.""""""",1284354937

In contrast with China, their system discourages standardized testing, especially for young children—iirc, they don't even receive grades until fifth grade. See, eg: <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wherewestand/reports/globalization/finland-whats-the-secret-to-its-success/206/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wherewestand/reports/globalization/f...</a> and <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120425355065601997.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120425355065601997.html</a><p>So what does this mean? Clearly there's more to it than just ""more testing is necessary!"" or the reverse. Is the Anglosphere in some ""unhappy middle"", where moving towards either more OR less testing would help? Is the amount of testing in fact orthogonal to school performance? I know both Finland and China are said to have high levels of societal respect for education, perhaps that's the crucial factor—but I'm not aware of any good measurements of this, maybe it's anecdotal.<p>Another hypothesis is that there's a fairly hard limit to how well children can be educated at this point in time, and that the best schools in Finland, China and the U.S. all near this limit. In China we only look at the best schools and students, and with so many people in China the best will look pretty good. Finland has very high equality and homogeneity, so the worst schools aren't so far off from the best, and the whole country comes out looking good. The U.S., however, has many badly funded schools and marginalized populations, so that could make the difference. Then the question becomes whether we can approach Finland's success, or if the Anglo countries are too inherently different. Again, this entire paragraph is truly rampant speculation, and my mind and gut are both skeptical.<p>Thoughts, anyone?",1284354300
