Some aren't marked, 1 seems to be empty, and 2 have percentages that are WAY out of line with their size.  And of course, it's way more than 100%.",1284889667

I'm a perfect example...  When using my skills, I get nothing but praise from employers.  When they tell me to teach someone else to do the same, it's nothing but pain for everyone involved.  I'm sure the trainee learned -something-, but a teacher would have done a much better job.  It's not even that I don't want to teach, because I used to want to...  Until I learned that I have no knack for it.<p>I'm not saying you can't teach it...  I'm just saying your degree in it doesn't mean that.  They are perfectly correct to force you to prove you can pass the certification.",1284889535

1705921,comment,1705133,1705876,0,0,frossie,,,"The article refers to the fate of adult autistic children when their parents die. The movie's character relates to a person in similar circumstances - his mother dies and a social worker places him in sheltered then independent accomodation.<p>I apologise if the phrase ""mentally challenged"" was offensive or inappropriate (the English language never fails to trip me up). As far as I can recall, the movie does not identify the specific developmental disability, but the main character engages in obsessive and ritualistic behaviours and has a number of challenges with fully integrating in society. His friend has different issues. The movie has a very positive message, as had the OP. I encourage you to judge by yourself rather than read the IMDB description. If you feel I have misrepresented it, I am interested in your views, my contact details are in my profile.<p>The real issue, I thought, is what is the appropriate level of state intervention / social support in circumstances where the parents-caregivers pass on.",1284889085

I was amazed at how bad I found them this time around.<p>Especially, because I've read 2 Harry Potters recently and they are fairly readable.

The hardbacks had a classic feel.  The pages were thick, the illustrations mysterious and the covers were heavy and ornate.  When I finished one I felt like I accomplished something.  I would put it on the shelf in between 10 others and decide on the next one - usually by coolness of cover.  I vividly remember the scene in ""Missing Chums"" when they drove the boat into the smugglers cave.  My heart was pounding.  I remember I got so nervous that I hid under a table and shifted positions constantly while reading it.  It may have been the first time I got completely immersed in a book.<p>Knowing that he called the books, ""The Juveniles,"" and that he viscerally hated every every word of every page, is like finding out that Santa Claus doesn't exist - at age 32.<p>And just to twist the knife, on my birthday the author wrote in his diary:
June 9, 1933: ""Tried to get at the juvenile again today but the ghastly job appalls me.""<p>Ok I just woke my girlfriend up by laughing so hard.  I don't know what to think.  Goodnight HN. Thank you for the best thing I've read all year.",1284888221

We want to make support software mainly which uses all streams from which support requests come being email, twitter, facebook and many more.
But out product will also feature a section where we try to aggregate the customers contact data and have a list of tasks. Because we think that this information (contact & tasks) should be synced with other services I am trying to make a list of the most popular services so we can integrate them first.<p>For now here the list I made (the further up the more important):<p>_Contacts_
* Google Contacts
* Highrise<p>_Tasks_
* Remember the Milk
* Google Calendar / Google Tasks
* Highrise<p>I would appreciate your help!
