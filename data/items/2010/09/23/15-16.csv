1720074,comment,1717850,1719921,0,0,elblanco,,,"This is really a great piece of analysis. I don't have anything to add at all.<p>Basically, becoming a platform is where both companies need to go, and start monetizing that platform. But unfortunately for Google, they are much further away from being that than FB is.<p>I would go so far as to say that Google has utterly failed to figure out a good diversification strategy -- at this point, they just dump something out there and slap some targeted ads on it. But outside of search and gmail, they don't really have much of interest they can monetize on.<p>Google Apps might be their next billion dollar product line, \nif they can turn it into something decent. Enterprises are where lots of money is at, but their enterprise offerings are really rather lousy.<p>I'm actually sometimes flabberghasted at how much wasted potential Google has in terms of obvious monetize-able offerings they have in their basket, but all of them are treated like incomplete one-off projects done on employee's 20%...with vast stretches of time between obvious enhancements and/or some necessary things never getting built at all.<p>FB, on the other hand, <i>has</i> the platform but isn't doing anything with it that's readily monetize-able, and they can manage to keep people at the site, but there's really not a whole heck of a lot for people to actually spend money on. Once again, I don't understand why something like Ping or Pandora/last.fm isn't a central part of FB's strategy. It's like a videogame console with only 1 or 2 games.",1285257559

Especially the ""early adopter of Silverlight"", you probably had a dedicated team back at MS.<p>And there are other large companies that also rise to this size. What confuses me is the 30-person ISV that believes that they can get magical super awesome support from Microsoft. They can't, or at least nothing better than they can get from open source. And typically, I find they know it too; they know better than to try to contact Microsoft, yet they still hold the mythical ability to do so in their hands like a security blanket. <i>That's</i> what confuses and to some extent annoys me; saying ""I can get support from MS"" when it's true makes sense, but using that as a reason to use MS when it's not is just silly.<p>It's a big selling point and that's legitimately true, but unless you're absolutely huge it <i>doesn't apply to you</i>.",1285257504

1720050,comment,1719975,1719975,0,0,spolsky,,,"I hate to leap in with what seems like an ad-hominem attack on the 37 signals, but their utter and complete misunderstanding of all the basics of business is starting to grate on me, and I'm wondering if it has anything to do with Chicago. Is the problem that they're sitting there in a city without any other Internet industry, stewing in their own witty ideas, listening only to the adoring comments they get from the groupies? How else could you explain just how far they seem to have drifted away from basic reality?<p>First of all, David: The word is VALUATION, not evaluation. KTHX.<p>Secondly, EVERY SINGLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD that has shares that trade is valued by taking the last share traded and multiplying by the number of shares outstanding. It's just the DEFINITION of valuation. It's TAUTOLOGICAL.<p>The whole section ""Minority investment evaluations aren’t real"" is so economically bizarre and incorrect that I don't even know where to start. It's like you wrote a blog post arguing that it is incorrect to refer to a 5' tall boy as 5' tall because he's often sitting down. Every single day every single public company in the world is valued by the last share traded, usually for a tiny fraction of the company.<p>Finally, to the main point. Facebook has certainly figured out how to make money off of 500,000,000 users. And as they optimize, they will make a lot more money. When they figure out how to make another DIME off of every user, they will instantly be making another $50,000,000 a year... in pure profit. How much profit will 37signals make if you figure out how to make another dime off of every customer? Eh David? Facebook works on the theory that when you have a lot of people, you don't have to make as much per person, because the amount of money you make is the number of customers times the amount of money you make off of each one. Again, that pesky multiplication.<p>It's weird, it's like in Chicago they don't have multiplication or something.",1285257228

Usually the suburbs located in other other cities with lesser service requirements will entice the tax income over the state line using incentives. They work in the city, therefore benefiting from a strong (and usually expensive) city government, and commute out into the other state. It's like a more extreme version of white flight, because it pushes taxes completely out of the state. The ""inexpensive housing"" you talk about is located in the inner city, not the suburbs.<p>In Memphis, where I live, most lower income people can't afford to live outside the bubble of city-provided public transit and/or social services. Even the middle class people live within the city limits, but on the very far outskirts. The wealthier people live outside the city in exclusive, incorporated suburbs where they avoid city taxes. Essentially the incorporated suburbs are designed as tax shelters for the wealthy. The wealthy people almost always work in the city and complain about the crime, poverty, crumbling roads, etc, but will dodge any tax that might help fix these problems.<p>We also have a pair of large middle class suburbs located just to the south of the city in Mississippi state. The county they're in is now the richest county in Mississippi. All of the income tax and most of the sales tax from these people who undoubtedly work in city is funneled out of the state of TN and into the coffers of MS. Every workday, they use our roads, police/fire protection, and by proxy, most of our other local gov't services.

I think it is fair to say that Gmail is probably their only success in this regard - and even that hasn't solved their problem of diversifying revenue.<p>I think much of the current GOOG valuation is predicated on both the revenue growth they were seeing (as you point out, though investors should have seen the flat line coming) and a bet on the ability for Google to utilize their place on the web to build out a 'platform' of sorts with applications and other services. They have failed at both tasks, and it is only a matter of time that the market wises up to this and brings the value of the stock back to a PE more in line with that of a traditional media company (as that is what Google is at its core with this revenue model).<p>Watching Facebook grow must be really painful for Google, a real punch in the face and a bruised ego. At some point, I wonder, when will they take a step back and admit failure and re-evaluate their entire management structure.<p>I have the numbers somewhere, but Google's eCPM rate is just insane. I imagine that Facebook atm would be lucky to achieve a penny - so there is some room for improvement but I do agree with you that their primary business model will come from platform.<p>I think if FB are game, they could try in-stream advertising. A scenario would be a new movie being launched. The marketers for the movie could throw away their traditional website and go to the FB sales team, setup a custom page and then specify who they want targetted - say, 18-30 year old males in the US. Facebook could carve out this demographic, and then run an exclusive in-stream pop-in for a 24 hour period for millions of dollars. The users might react, but they could just make the ad clear. This is much more powerful than what Google offers - since they can only target a users attention, while Facebook is the only website with a global reach where users can be targeted directly.<p>I think in 2-3 years time that $3-5B from advertising is possible. Add another $3-5 from platform, and you are at $6-10B, with a lot of room to grow and a potential $60-150B valuation.<p>Also as an aside, won't Facebook be forced to go public at some point due to SEC regulations? I know they have placated employees by offering a sanctioned second market, but at some point they have to bite the bullet and list. It could be possible that they are waiting to book 12 months of platform revenue and a full year of those results for the prospectus (which will make the filing look a lot better - 2 major sources of revenue and strong growth).<p>Overall a very interesting topic. If you had a chance to today, would you buy Facebook stock at $20B? or $10B? :)",1285255179

We were equal partners, and the ""CEO"" put some of his own money in.<p>We built the product for the whole summer. It was basically all code, and I ended up doing the lion's share of the work. The other developer did a lot of work too, but the CEO literally did nothing. No marketing, no fundraising, and there was nothing else to do, so he did nothing. He did't even have ideas, or project management help. Absolutely nothing. He stopped showing up the office altogether eventually, and would stroll in every few days and demand to know where the next feature was. In addition to this, some steeply unethical behavior of this dead-weight CEO came to light during the course of our partnership.<p>It was just a terrible arrangement, in every way, so this past week the other developer and I decided to shut down the start-up.<p>When we told the CEO, though, he wanted to keep on running it, get all of our equity back, and profit off of the hard-earned code/design/ideas that he had zero part in.<p>This really bothers me out of principle. Because the whole reason we wanted to close down the company is that we wanted to kick him out, but out of courtesy to him, we felt it would be more graceful if we just shutdown the company and started working on a new idea with just the two of us (me and the other developer) - rather than it being a power play, etc. (Also, to avoid bad blood, we told him that we just ""weren't motivated about the idea anymore"" (which was true), as opposed to the more blunt ""we just want to stop working with you because you're a joke.""<p>Technically, I believe the corporate structure dictates that the three of us have equal seats on the board, so the other developer and I could ""fire"" the CEO, but then the company would awkwardly owe him the money he put in (which was a ""loan""). I suppose we could liquidate/bankrupt the company, but that would require some messy legal involvement.<p>We wanted to shut down the company gracefully, but our third co-founder's rude and ungracious reaction to this decision, I fear, leaves us no other choice than to explore messier options.<p>Please offer any advice you can.<p>Thanks,\nSteve<p>P.S.

They're coming with the newer OS, but your old features rarely go away. Contrast this with upgrades from PHP 3 to 4 or 5, stillborn Perl 6, great divide between Python 2 and 3.<p>(2) - Please... Your old frameworks are still there. You are discouraged to use them, but they didn't go away. I seriously don't understand how this is a problem?<p>(3) - Again, technology is not frosen. Competitors are coming out with new shinier things - why Microsoft should stick to only what was there back 20 years ago? So they push their shiny stuff into the limelight. But given that old frameworks are still in place, it's not a problem.<p>""The push to COM and machine generated stub code."" - I don't understand your grudge here. Why didn't you ask yourself: do _I_ really need to use COM? COM solves some particular problem - was it _your_ problem? Did ole-good Windows API and C++ classes just go away with the advent of COM? I for one am a C++/Win32|64 and .NET dev. Last few years I'm asking myself a question - do _I_ need to use WPF, just because it is there? My answer is no - I'm just ignoring it, as I ignore other shiny things that don't solve _my_ problem.<p>BTW, maybe this will sound like a blasphemy here, on HN, but Microsoft could teach a thing or two to the ""platform vendors"" out there. The pace of change and amount of inconsistency that is being introduced by everyone and their dog with web service ""APIs"" is astounding. Compared to that, MS' approach of keeping of old stuff while introducing new one is simply a god-send.",1285254505
