All the functions are the same, but the experience is different, and for them that means everything is different and unknown. Their understanding of simple is from way before we even had our fist microwave.<p>Simplicity is not a myth, it's just not a constant.

People sometimes send support mail about very advanced features indicating that the 'power users' are definitely able to find their way. But for 99% of the audience the first level is all they'll ever get to and they're happy there.<p>If you sell a luxury car, apparently it has to have buttons.<p>But when you look at those buttons on a 10 year old car you'll see which ones are the ones that got used (because they wore!). As a rules, it's the same buttons that you'll find on a Lada.<p>But cars are 'conspicuous consumption' for some, so they are not to be compared with a web-app.<p>Something like 'mint' has enormous functionality but they've made it relatively (as easy as you can make it I guess) easy to get on board because of this exposure trick.<p>Good software uses context. Over-complex design does <i>not</i> drive sales unless you're trying to send all your competitors down a dead end street.<p>Microsoft word, that pinnacle of design, is only where it is today because of lock-in, if not for that (users emailing each other word documents) and some pretty ruthless marketing it wouldn't stand a chance.<p>Text editing is - as someone quoted here - a solved problem, but it seems that there still isn't an easy way to get what you want. Possibly there will never be (because text editing is inherently complex), but that should not discourage those that seek to enhance the user experience with minimalist approaches.<p>To me the apple audio line of products is a great example of how minimal + gradual exposure is the way to enormous sales, don't forget they weren't the first company to produce an audio player (or a smartphone either).",1283510415

1659112,comment,1658117,1658805,0,0,pedrocr,,,"lp/mm is just a unit of measure for resolution and is directly constrained by the number of pixels. You can't resolve 10 lines with less than 20 pixels and in practice you need more.<p>The article you quoted compares the same resolution in different sized sensors to show that smaller sensors need to resolve more lp/mm in sensor area to achieve the same file in the end. It shows that for the same MP count a larger sensor is better. What we are discussing is the opposite, for the same sensor size MP count is better. And as far as resolution is concerned that tends to be the case, even if the lens is the biggest bottleneck.<p>In DSLRs we're getting to a point where resolution is more constrained by camera movement and lens quality than number of pixels but at the same time both those bottlenecks are being addressed with modern lens design and anti-shake techniques. We've come a long way in actual practical resolution from the 2MP/4MP cameras you mentioned.",1283510126

Most cash-cows are really complex beasts. See Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop, Oracle.\nIf the emphasis of your product is simplicity, chances are you have to compete with free software.\nJoel had a presentation on this: there are dozens of simple bug trackers out there, lots of them are free, but still only a few companies make big money in the field, and their products are not the simplest ones.\nI still value simplicity, it is just risky if that is the  main value proposition of a product.<p>Also there is simplicity on the user's side and there is simplicity on the engineering side. Sometimes it implies incredibly complex and hard engineering work to enable simplicity on the user's side.

Now, somebody might say - but who, then, created these laws, who said that they're going to work the way they do? And that's just the thing - nobody did. It's just the way (our) universe works.

1659076,comment,1659020,1659020,0,0,todayiamme,,,"I agree with the author, but there is one point he seems to have overlooked; brand. If you create a brand identity consisting of easy to use and, actually, useful products. Then this issue becomes <i>your</i> selling point. It's all about perception and designing your products for something as fluid as human perception is like trying to wrestle with water. Instead, if you hire just the right PR then you can put that water into a nice, little container.<p>However, consumer products aside there are some cases where a complex, but not complicated, solution is better than the simple solution. For example, city planners have this eternal tendency to build flyovers whenever and wherever they can, but the flyovers themselves can't handle the increasing loads after a certain period of time. So, then what?<p>A more complex, but uncomplicated solution would be to make the traffic lights respond dynamically at a city wide scale with traffic. If you can figure out the volume of cars on a given stretch of road vs. other roads you can then use a routing algorithm to predict the best timing and path to guide the cars. It's more complex than the flyover, but it's cheaper and the leftover money can be then put into making better mass transportation in order to cut down car growth.<p>Further, you can figure out the volume of traffic by using accelerometers embedded in the road. Any vibration propagating through a solid medium has certain characteristics, which can be accurately predicted by studying solid acoustics. Hence, if you have an array of sensors (they are cheap) you can track the vibrations down to their respective sources. In this scenario accuracy is not an issue, a roundabout number should be good enough.<p>Powering the sensors isn't much of an issue either and we can put wire them to micro-controllers that crunch some of the data and sends it higher up the chain.<p>So, at the end we have an entire city that behaves and responds like an organism to the traffic flowing in its veins. It will be just beautiful.<p>The irony is that its inherent complexity ensures that people won't buy it. After all, who would want to trust solid math?",1283508683
