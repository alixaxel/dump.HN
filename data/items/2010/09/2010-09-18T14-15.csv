They give you a 70%-85% chance to gain immunity. So even if 0 are left unvaccinated, 30% of the population has no immunity.<p>It is unlikely to infect a large portion of the population, but especially for vaccines which are only 70% effective, it's highly likely 1 or 2 others will get infected who were vaccinated but it didn't take. In addition to the 30% of people who do not have immunity, immunocompromised people often time can lose immunity to certain viruses based on their condition. They are the 1 or 2 people our society has chosen to be effectively infectable in spite of vaccination. That's why its very important <i>everyone</i> else gets vaccinated.<p>The likelihood of a huge outbreak is still relatively small, but you're wrong on the statistics of the small infection, as you'd see from a friend coming by or out to dinner with you or going to day care. Roughly 15% to 30% will get many of the diseases when ""intensely exposed"". The chance of a small outbreak is moderately large with 70% vaccines and even moderate lack of vaccinations.<p>Your argument, in addition to be attempted technical nitpicking which is wrong, is very dangerous as other posters have made.

We ask that you try to avoid redundancy; if someone has already defined a name that does roughly what you want, please reuse it.""</i><p>They will also argue that menu is intended to create toolbars and menus within a webpage, not within the browser itself - and that by using meta extensions, the IE team have implemented their browser-specific extensions in a standards-based way supported by the WHATWG. They will say that it also doesn't pollute the markup with an extension that only applies to a single browser on a single platform (which is why WHATWG developed the meta extensions). In short, pages that implement this are HTML5 compliant.<p>Now my own opinion. The browser makers need differentiation between their products. Browser market share is as important, if not more important, than OS market share.<p>If Microsoft want to enable websites to deeply integrate with a Windows desktop by using meta extensions, then that seems like the right place to do it. A lot of us would prefer that every browser maker simply implements the standards, but a lot of innovation in web technologies (img tag, applets, xmlhttprequest) started life as browser-specific extensions. Frowning upon, or not allowing any differentiation would remove a lot of motivation for pouring resources into browser development.<p>As much as we might not like it, we have to deal with it - at least they put this extension in the right place with meta instead of not implementing menu properly or doing their own implementation of menu (besides, I can't think how this desktop pinning would work on for eg. OS X and Chrome - it seems something very 'active desktop' windows specific).",1284820717

In my awareness, and to my interest, frameworks to meet psycho-social challenges in software development are still so lacking. I'm glad that Spolsky and Atwood are working on this.",1284819994

I'm often amazed that we force children to study subjects like geography or physics, that are important but only if you're interested in them and not terribly practical anyway.<p>I think all children should have to learn basic life skills to enable them to control their physical and social environment ('hack' in the context of this article). Subjects such as driving, mechanics, basic electronics, law, small business, tax, nutrition, rhetoric, negotiation, plumbing etc. etc. And those just off the top of my head.<p>All 'academic' subjects should merely be introduced and then left up to the student to choose to pursue. What on earth is the point of filling children's heads full of history (for example) if they aren't interested? They forget every word of it a year after their final exam anyway.",1284819338

1704196,comment,1703482,1703482,0,0,mixu,,,"I use revenue per employee as a rough guide to the type of company in question (is it human-based or tech/marketing-based? is it a startup or an established business?). It's simple to calculate, and revenue is usually less sensitive information than net income per employee (so easier to get for non-public companies). My feeling is that for the average (non-public, not particularly successful but OK, non-automated) company the average salary is about 1/3 of that (more or less). Actual net income per employee of course depends on the degree of automation and success.<p>Example tables:<p><a href=""http://www.jbryanscott.com/2009/02/07/nasdaq-100-revenue-per-employee/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jbryanscott.com/2009/02/07/nasdaq-100-revenue-per...</a><p><a href=""http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2283-ranking-tech-companies-by-revenue-per-employee"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/svn/posts/2283-ranking-tech-companies-b...</a>",1284819264

[EDIT: Even if my assumption of the nature of the exploit is wrong, that's not my point. My point is the questions below.]<p>So, an attacker could alter the data of a cookie, thus impersonating a user or security level, and they could also alter the contents of ViewState. I don't use ViewState any more, having moved on to ASP.NET MVC, and I shudder to think what actually might get stored in there, but what is the route to alter ViewState and cause arbitrary commands to be executed on the server? I ask, because the article states this vulnerability allows an attacker to: ""read data from files on the target server, such as web.config."" Files like web.config are not allowed to be served up, out of the box, so does this SA assume that remote errors, which I believe will display a portion of the web.config, are enabled, or that this exploit can cause them to become enabled?",1284819155

1704191,comment,1704041,1704106,0,0,skermes,,,"Based on the prose examples the article gives (the chess/lunch story and the crucifixion/bike race story), it looks like a truly 'pataphysical system wouldn't need IO at all.  Instead, you'd have a program of some sort, that was simultaneously doing 'pataphysical computation and mundane computation.  In the story of Jesus and the bike race, the narrative never shifts between the story of racing up the hill and the story of Jesus being killed on a cross, the story is both at the same time throughout.  By analogy, I suspect the article would like us to consider what kind of system we'd need to construct in order to, I suppose, be a story about a bike race (or something else equally removed from programmer's usual domain) <i>and</i> an application to serve web pages at the same time.<p>Of course, given 'pataphysic's status as ""the science of imaginary solutions"" I won't be holding my breath for a 'pataprogrammatical Rails-killer anytime soon, but it's a fun idea.",1284818980
