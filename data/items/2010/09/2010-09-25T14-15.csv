So, he wants to increase productivity by making us think about and write theorems in addition to our normal code (don't underestimate the time you invest in this), making our code even more static and less reusable in the hope that the reduction in time for bug hunting and testing will make up for the time invested in thinking about and creating more complex code? Hard to believe. Do those language designers create this stuff to show off how intelligent they are or just for the sake of having fun or are they seriously trying to make development easier? I can't imagine building a website with this. But then again, maybe those languages are designed for satellites, space shuttles, and simulations (i.e. where correctness is far more important than productivity)? Well, I think most of us have to make a compromise between productivity and correctness. It's the same as having 100% code coverage. Nice in theory, but it makes refactorings and development too costly and still doesn't guarantee that your software is 100% correct. Here's a nice post if you still believe 100% code coverage is the ultimate #1 goal of your project:

Well, it took me one week but hey, that was fun to hack into memcached. So, I'm opening a service for Linode users (Dallas data center only for now but more to come !) that lets you share a memcached server.<p>The idea is kind of an experiment : you share _one_ instance. I don't provide you with fixed and different memcached servers, but you read it correctly : only one. This one is having a 200MB bucket for now but will be upgraded if needed.<p>How it works: you connect your memcache client to the linode which is running the memcached and I let you in if you registered to the beta. You can use the 200MB bucket as you wich, provided that the maximum expire (TTL) is set to 30 minutes (1800 seconds). Don't ask more, it won't work :)<p>Well, for the security, you'll probably be happy to know that you can't read/delete/modify keys that are not yours.<p>You can see this service as a super bursting and free (for now) super service !<p>In the future, if it works, I plan to make it a paid service but surprise, I would charge only 1 or 2 dollars/month. This way, you can temporary burst a 200MB (more coming !) memcached server for nearly free.<p>Hope you enjoy it and I'm opened to any suggestion for improvements. To participate to the beta, please visit this webpage which will explain you what you can/can't do , and the way to get it.<p>http://www.henri.pro/2010/09/25/memcached-shared-instance-beta/<p>Have a nice week end everyone !

They used to be all about developers.</i><p>I think only getting miffed that your <i>OWN</i> service wasn't perfect and then posting to HN about how task.fm was ""screwed over"" is more damaging to twilio (is it?) than an SMS outage.<p>The author didn't read Twilio's own SLA and hardened entrepreneurs don't burn bridges publicly everytime something goes wrong.<p>I know trying to build an awesome web application is hard and its frustrating when supporting services go down, but that is the nature of our beast.

Getting mad and cutting off your own hand because you are angry isn't helping build anything.<p>Google's API has bugs that my start-ups web application runs into all the time. Sometimes they change API behavior, which the visualization screws up the entire UI in the process. <i>This effects thousands of our users and we have to release work-arounds as fast as we can.</i> But I don't blame Google - it was our choice to use their APIs.<p>Generally, this sort of thing will continue to happen with all web service APIs. As a community of developers, I would ask them why it happened and provide constructive feedback about how important it was. You might just find they'll listen and you'll have more pull.<p>Great start-ups have a short list of early adopters or engaged users that they trust and continually go back to for product advice. Writing a post like this pulls the rug out from under your own service because you refuse to use it, it will cost you more, and twilio will suffer from lack of valuable constructive feeback.<p>Really just my POV, but hopefully you'll find why posting inflamatory articles like this only hurts entrepreneurs and our community at large.

From my experience in many enterprises, this is usually not the case.<p>First, a few numbers...<p>What I've typically experienced in enterprises:<p><pre><code>  IT people (programmers, analysts, admins)       -  1%
  indirect people (office, sales, management)     - 10%
  direct people (warehouse, factory, call center) - 89%
</code></pre>
So a 1500 employee enterprise may have 15 IT people, 150 indirect people, and 1335 direct people.  (The numbers may vary some, but you get the idea.)<p>In an engineering firm or software house, the engineers and programmers <i>are</i> the direct people, but I don't really think of these types of firms as ""enterprise"".<p>Remember, no one earns anything until the direct people do something.  Their production absorbs the overhead of everyone else, including IT.<p>Why do I bring up these numbers?  Because I learned from a smart mentor long ago that solving your direct people's problems delivers value magnitudes greater than solving your indirect people's problems.  Kinda like Willie Sutton robbing banks because, ""That's where the money is.""  It's strictly a numbers game.<p>Back to the question at hand: your people, especially your direct people need the right information and direction to get stuff done.  Good application software and good management have always been the most effective way of doing this.  Sure, gadgets have a place and deliver some value, but they are generally not the solution to enterprise problems.<p>Like wikis, intranets, and all the rest, social media is just another gadget.",1285424566

Some people can afford to dabble in BS, we Africans can't. You have so much to do my friend, get to it!<p>Ideas for you.<p>1) Write a health-care record management system for Nigerians. A free service that allows doctors to store medical records and notes about patient history and prescriptions. Since most people don't have government IDs, device a way to uniquely identify each person (parents name, place of birth, first name, gender, approximate year of birth, last place where a doctor has accessed the medical record, etc.)<p>I want to do something like that for Somalia, my home country, but don't have the safety to go back there and deploy it. Might go to the refugee camps in Kenya. Shot an email to Save The Children, no reply yet. I want to make a $100 Android tablet that photographs handwritten prescriptions and stores in a central location. The camera can also function as a way to capture visible problems for remote diagnosis.<p>If you can just pry data health data from the hands of government and NGOs and put it ""out there"", you wont be short of help.<p>2) Start a website where people can submit study materials suitable for cheap printing. Exercises and practice games that can be succinctly printed into a few, multicolumn pages. Get the feds to give you a printing service and churn out study materials, send on donkey backs to villages.<p>You can advance education tremendously by teaching teachers new games and teaching practices, that are fun for both them and students. Tap into new research on learning, and do the simplest stuff first.<p>3) Chronicle and catalog a verbal recording of the myriad of languges and dialects in nigeria. Send a voice recorder with several hours and let the elders speak about everything. Transcribe that into IPA and save it for the kids. The cities are growing and languages are dying. Also, provide corpora of your languages free online to linguists and programmers can develop NLP tools. As long as African languages remain oral we wont have a mention in computing.<p>4) Create an online talent website. Reward people for discovering street musicians, painters, folk artists and inventors. The talent gets a mention, and whoever discovered them gets a prop. Put in some game mechanics to encourage the more affluent people with the technical means to go out of their way to interact with, the often poor, local talents. Ignore government aid and other BS. You can bootstrap this with funds from local businesses and transnationals that want to feel-good aspect of this local involvement.",1285423876
