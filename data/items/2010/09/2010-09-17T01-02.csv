The nearest place was called CafeNation, and it was pretty good. I'd go in there 5-6 days a week when I wasn't traveling, and usually got a crepe and then a coffee or tea. I was a regular, most people knew me.<p>One day I was in and out real fast to confirm something on email, I set my computer up, jammed away for 30 minutes in a hurry, didn't buy anything that time. Very, very unlike me, I was just absorbed in work. Whatever it was, it was semi-urgent.<p>The girl at the counter was new and didn't recognize me, and as I was packing up, she said, ""<i>Excuse me</i>, are you going to <i>buy something or what</i>?"" I was kind of shaken by this. I bought a juice to go, but then I started going to CafeNation a lot less.<p>Thing is, in retrospect it was totally silly. It shouldn't have made a difference - one employee who didn't know who wasn't even that rude from her perspective. I didn't even reply to her that I was a regular, I just gave her $2 and grabbed the orange juice and left, and then I started going to CafeNation a whole lot less.

1699702,comment,1698588,1698588,0,0,jojomagictime,,,"I work for a Skydiving company that has, to GREAT success, ran two GroupOn promotions. We sell three different types of jumps, 10k 15k and 18k. The 10k goes for $169 and is out of a 5 seat Cessna, available only on some weekends. The 15k and 18k are available weekends and most weekdays and cost $199 and $259. Our 15k and 18k jumps are out of a large, 15 seat aircraft.<p>We sold 10k jumps for $99. The COGS for this product is about $130. We cannot disclose our cut with GroupOn, but assuming the average 50/50 cut, we're selling these things for less than half of what it costs to produce. Why did we do this?<p>1.We know that 50% of our gift certificates are never redeemed.<p>2. We know that 60% of our customers purchase video and/or T-Shirts.<p>3. We know that about 90% of our customers will jump from 15k or 18k. We just ask that the GroupOns pay the difference in price. $30 to 15k, $90 to 18k.<p>4. We know that many of our customers bring friends, sign up for our solo training, come back for a second jump, post their video on YouTube, and tell the world how much fun they had.<p>Our first run sold 800, our second sold 1000. GroupOn customers aren't awful, but they seem to carry a higher percentage of snooty, complainy people. The vast majority of our poor reviews on Yelp come from GroupOn people whose experience really wasn't horrible, they are just particularly nitpicky.<p>GroupOn is a very dangerous game. I can TOTALLY understand how someone can get their ass handed to them. However, that's part of the numbers game you play. I agree with other comments, if you find a way to get 1000 people to walk in your door and spend money, and you can't figure out how to turn that into a positive for your business, then, well... Maybe you should do something else with your money.<p>GroupOn is crazy awesome. We love them! We have so far sold 1800 skydives through GroupOn! To put that in perspective, our busiest month this year we put 400 tandems up in the air. In two GroupOn promotions we've sold almost one year's worth of business. Staggering numbers.",1284686984
