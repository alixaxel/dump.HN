This is a gross overgeneralization and not the complete story.<p>Do you currently have a better opportunity in front of your face than college? Cause Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg went to college and quit when that kind of opportunity (a huge one) appeared in front of them. They never ask online forums for life directions (they might ask their parents, something that seems not happening in your life).<p>It looks like you're a typical badass teenager who has problem with authority, discipline, and focus rather than a badass developer. We'll see if you can be successful without changing that mindset. I know a few of my friends who were like you in the past but had to succumb somehow. You don't live in your own world, there are other people around you.<p>So no, you're not going to learn 3x much since you don't even know what to learn and where to start?

But badass? yeah, badass in a bad term, not in some sort of hacker-y awesome term. Please do yourself a favor and don't waste your precious potential. Go to college.<p>Now, here's the meat: go to college and take either Business, Economics, Commerce, or Accounting major. Technical skill itself won't do any good. If you can't work under anybody else, that means you have to lead. Take Leadership, Communication, Psychology courses.<p>And do the world a favor before you screw other people in the future in any shape or form or opportunity: find a good mentor cause you need some guidance.",1284321399

Something such as versioning is completely ad-hoc and should not mark the advancement/maturity of a software product. How long did VLC take to get to version 1.0? That does not mean their development/release cycle is any slower than Chrome's.

Knowing you could go to jail for a very long time if you do something stupid or illegal is a strong motivator.  For those not so motivated, most places not only segregate the network but also the data: tapes or backup data are kept onsite in a secure area, computers used for interacting with the data never leave the secure area and have been modified not to have USB headers or removable hard drives, cables and gear are physically protected from tampering, etc.<p>None of this is to say that all risk is eliminated, but since most systems are compromised by casual hackers using simple tools, adding the security you can is usually a sensible thing to do.",1284320592

This isn't 100% of course, nothing is, but it's largely effective I would guess.<p>Stolen laptops of course happen on occasion, but it's a dramatically different problem than unintentional access to a data center, or all the data therein.  Further, most of the laptops I've seen have data-at-rest encryption, remote locating devices (GPS) and fairly stringent security protections on the device.  In order to connect to any sensitive networks, they'd also have to use VPN and 2 factor encryption.<p>Largely, these things have already been thought of... but more importantly, if you're statement holds weight, and they should have stringent controls everywhere to be effective, then why would they arbitrarily allow their data to be potentially compromised in the event that Amazon has less stringent requirements -- and guess what, they do.",1284319836

1684362,comment,1683528,1684094,0,0,KevinMS,,,"This was a few years ago, so my memory is foggy and things might have changed, but I remember how uncomfortable erlang felt in a unix environment. I might have felt the same way about java, since its also sandboxy.<p>I think the first time I hit the mailing list was because I couldn't figure out how erlang can boot up and change its effective user id. (setuid).  The reason being it needs to grab a privleged port as root.  Well forget that, it has no idea what that means.  The recommended way is to use iptables port forwarding.  I think thats how couchdb does it (or one of those nosql things)<p>Logging also didn't seem to fit well with linux.  You can manage to write some stuff to syslog, but erlang really prefers its confusing way of logging. See things like this <a href=""http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/sasl_app.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/sasl_app.html</a>.<p>Oh and if you decide to just write data to the error log in the simpliest way possible, like this error_logger:error_msg(""An error occurred in ~p~n"", [a_module]).  Guess what, it doesn't open that log file in append mode, so it wipes it out every time you restart the
erlang process.  You have to write and install your own error log handler to open the file in append mode.<p>Want to do some dns lookups?  Sounds simple.  It starts up a
gen_server thread... and starts caching the results!  Talk about principle of most surprise.  And it doesn't handle mx records.  But if you get on the mailing list the guys will tell you there's an undocumented library deep in the distro that will handle this, and probably won't change.  So you give up in frustration and just write a port to run dig.<p>It just went on and on.<p>You can really tell that erlang evolved to run self sufficient on special hardware and not in a supportive unix environment.<p>And of course there are the basic language frustrations.  What bothered me the most was simply the lack of a 'return'. This meant you couldn't 'short circuit' a function, like ""if something then return"", and it often resulted in another level of nesting, even for the
simpliest stuff.  Yes I know that sometimes you could use function pattern matching to factor this out, but not as much as you hope. Having a 'return' statement in erlang is part of a religious war, which I'm not going to fight, but I'm strongly on the having side.<p>I found some erlang things worked great for my project, like the server and finite state machine 'behaviors', but when I realized the string processing was so slow I just switched to stackless python, wrote it in a fraction of the time, never used it, and ended up keeping the existing perl version :)<p>You can write a MTA in any language, so its probably not the best fit for erlang.  The best fit for erlang would be something that only erlang could do, and just suffer through it ;-)",1284319801

Recently <i>Park Kultury</i> was partially closed for several months, <i>Belorusskaya</i> is probably going to be closed for some time next year. The latter is a very high-traffic station so maybe they will just limit its capacity by 50%. 90% of the time I go via subway, at least one escalator (they are usually in groups of two) is not working, reducing capacity by 50%, with people waiting in a <i>huge</i> line. Sometimes the train will just stop between the stations and stand there for anywhere between 10 minutes and half an hour. Rarely, like once in several months, some shit will happen on <i>Filevskaya</i> line and it will halt for several hours. Underground it's always uncomfortably warm and stuffy – both in summer and in winter. More than enough to get sweaty. The <i>Filevskaya</i> (surface) line, on the contrary, was very cold in the winter (maybe it's better now with the new trains, though). Passenger density of one per square foot in rush hour is also not very comfortable, and when random strangers apply considerable force to push you deeper into the train so that they can get in too, it's also not OK (and it happens in rush hour <i>always</i>, not once a day/week/year). The new trains are simply idiotic. They <i>always</i> smell bad to some extent (they probably chose overly absorbing materials for the floor), they have no place for a map (the few places that could hold it are covered with ads), so the map is posted on the window, and is remarkably unreadable because of the combination of bright white letter outline, an otherwise transparent background, and the fact that you have to lean over a sitting person to see anything unless you have perfect vision and the train is on that rare spot of railroad where the train is not tossed sideways because the tracks are so old.<p>And it's not cheap. One pass ticket costs nearly $1. It was cheaper to take a bus in LA where median salary is several times higher. The subway is so popular only because it's rather fast with the roads being totally jammed in rush hour (and the buses go with them since there are no dedicated bus lanes). Except for speed, pretty much anything else about Moscow subway is horrid, unless you are a tourist who values the beauty of central stations and was brought there once and in off-peak hour.",1284319444

In the Droid X case you're weighing a 1GHz CPU vs 200Mhz GPU with a small number of cores. In fact, consider that we're fairly used to spending as much if not more for the GPU in desktop systems as the CPU.<p>I do know for a fact that Imagination's 2D interface (PVR2D) has a large setup overhead which makes blitting of small bitmaps very slow, but somewhat ok with larger bitmaps.
