""If they get their first service in, itself a 65%-ish probability for a top player, they will win the point with a roughly 75% likelihood."" implies a probability of winning the point on first service of just under 50%. Add in the ""only 50%-ish of the time"" for the second service and the 0% for the 3% of double faults, and I do not see how top players can win so many of their service games.<p>It still could be valid data for the whole set of professional tennis plagers (male and female), but I doubt one draw conclusions for individual players from it.",1284883070

I don't get why coffee shops never seem to do this: train your staff to make the rounds when they're not busy. Stop by any table with an empty cup, pick it up quietly, smile, gently ask the customer if they'd like anything else. (Don't nag or harangue the customer or ask the same one more than once an hour.)<p>Coffee shops have a problem with customers coming in and making themselves at home because they aren't being run like a business: there's very little staff-customer interaction. People come in, order (maybe), find a corner, and park there on the wifi for two hours. Shops respond to this by making customers come up to the counter to get a wep key, but that's the wrong way to do it. Instead, invite people in, invite them to stay, and ask them once in a while if you can bring them anything.<p>And as an added bonus, your staff will make a little extra in tips, too.",1284882989

That the iPhone's hardware and software is designed under one roof is a huge advantage.

2. If you're not savvy then you can buy exactly what you're after at price point that is acceptable to you (thus ensuring a proper price/performance).<p>People feel cheated since they didn't get more than what they paid for?

It's possible that the amount of guilt that this person feels is sufficient to motivate them to buy the a 160 gig disk (and spend time selectively copying the most important data) but not to motivate them to buy a 250 gig disk and copy everything.  It's also possible, though, that this person is trying to draw you into a conversation focusing on how important the data is to you, in order to convince you to send money to buy a disk or buy the laptop back.<p>Actually, how sure are you that they even have your laptop?  Did you mention the theft someplace public, like on a blog or twitter?  The only information they've demonstrated that they have is your email address, the fact that you've used Time Machine at least once (probably a pretty safe bet if they know your laptop was a Mac), and the approximate amount of data that you had stored (assuming you know that's correct and aren't just taking their word for it).",1284882852

Even at speeds of up to 40 MPH on the runway, the attack packets had their intended effect, whether it was honking the horn, killing the engine, preventing the car from restarting, or blasting the heat. Most dramatic were the effects of Device Control packets to the Electronic Brake Control Module (EBCM) — the full effect of which we had previously not been able to observe. In particular, we were able to release the brakes and actually prevent our driver from braking; no amount of pressure on the brake pedal was able to activate the brakes. Even though we expected this effect, reversed it quickly, and had a safety mechanism in place, it was still a frightening experience for our driver. With another packet, we were able to instantaneously lock the brakes unevenly; this could have been dangerous at higher speeds.",1284882133

1705767,comment,1705091,1705091,0,0,pmjordan,,,"This actually sounds pretty good to me, at least in theory.<p>Upgrading the CPU is quite costly - you have to take out the old CPU and replace it altogether with a new one. With HDDs you can put the old one in an external enclosure and get some use from it (if the reason you're replacing it isn't failure), and with RAM you might have slots free, so you can keep using the old stuff in addition to the new.<p>Replaced CPUs tend to be pretty useless. The socket type changes <i>all the time</i>, so you have to eBay it off. Laptops are worse, the CPUs are often soldered on or you can't find replacements.<p>The only real problem I foresee is that the upgrades are likely going to be of limited use. Hyperthreading gives you a modest boost, anything more than that (clock speed, disabled cores, cache) will drive up power consumption and therefore thermal dissipation. Computers upgradeable in this way will have to contain cooling systems that can cope with the extra heat, even if 90% of people will never upgrade. Might still be feasible for the very low end (Atoms - especially as they're so slow even ""normal"" people might upgrade) or as CPUs become increasingly modular (either double your CPU <i>or</i> GPU cores in the same package, but not both).",1284880057

1705758,comment,1705467,1705726,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I figured the same thing when I got the extended warranty on my first laptop.  Laptops are fragile, they die often, it was only like $100 (that's your $9/month for a year...), and if the laptop was broken before the extended warranty ran out (5 years, I think), I'd get a new one, based on <i>current laptop price/performance</i>.  I thought this was a great deal, since I thought it quite likely that my first one would die before 5 years and then I could get a much better one at no additional cost.<p>Problem was, when the laptop finally died about 3.5 years later, they made up some bullshit excuse about there being a ""liquid spill"" on it and refused to honor the extended warranty.  (Yeah, Circuit City, no wonder they're out of business...)<p>Anyway, I found the whole experience of trying to convince the service company that yes, my laptop needed servicing so distasteful that I didn't bother with any sort of insurance or extended warranty for my second.  And wouldn't you know, it lasted for 5 years, never needed servicing, and can still boot up and run today, though the network's a bit flaky and the battery is basically dead.<p>My point (and presumably webwright's, though I disagree with him in another thread) is that the insurance company has to be making money off this policy somehow - they've got lots of actuaries calculating odds to make sure they come out ahead at the rates they charge.  If you think ""of course my laptop is going to die within 29 years - I'm bound to come out ahead"", I'd suggest reading over your policy very carefully.  My guess is that they have some very strict conditions on <i>how</i> it dies, and there's a good chance they won't cover it for many mundane run-of-the-mill failures.<p>Buy insurance because you can't afford to cover the loss otherwise, not because you expect to make a profit on it.",1284879642
