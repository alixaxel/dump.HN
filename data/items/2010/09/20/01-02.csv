They played the same level--a flat level without platforms or items--over and over again for one reason--to get better. They had little interest in having fun and cared more about being the best.<p>One of our other roommates suggested that they play the game to have fun. They liked the suggestion and, as they began playing again, started to compete over who was having the most fun. My other roommate's comments had completely missed them.",1284947752

The only ways AMD can be competitive with Intel are to be really daringly clever with their chip design (Athlon 64, and hopefully the upcoming Bobcat and Bulldozer cores), sell their chips at lower profit margins, take advantage of Intel's mistakes (Itanic vs Athlon 64), and to pick their battles wisely (AMD has never been able to field a whole product lineup that is competitive across the board).

1707446,comment,1707305,1707305,0,0,InfinityX0,,,"Here's the problem with diet studies in general - they take ages to pan out. Because of that, there's varying degrees of belief in whether or not something is correct or incorrect, and even in cases where some breakthrough has been made, it takes ages to determine whether or not the choice was a correct one or not.<p>This is the same reason why certain food products sales largely come down to packaging - how can I really know the effect a protein supplement is making on my muscle growth due to the many other HUGE factors that come into play? Could I have done better without it? Same with insurance plans, investments, etc - at the end of the day many of these products end up getting bought and sold due more to the marketing savvy of their business departments more than the efficacy of the products themselves.<p>I'm slightly ranting but I think, food wise, the best way to judge whether or not something is good for you is quite simply, how it makes you feel immediately afterwards. If I eat too many carbs, I feel like crap. If I eat a Carl's Jr burger, I feel like crap. If I eat lean meat and fruits, I feel great. If I go overboard, I can hardly feel it. If I drink soda, I feel like crap. And so it goes.<p>I really think it's that simple - don't pollute your head with varying degrees of this stuff - if it makes you feel good, and that feeling STAYS even if you don't eat/drink it (see: withdrawals) it's probably damn good for you and you should keep consuming it.

There has also been a big decrease in signal-to-noise ratio, with a lot of crap published in journals, and not enough gardening work. IMO a much bigger proportion of scientific resources need to be put into survey articles, ""recent advances in X"" retrospectives, post-intro-level textbooks and tutorials, and even ideally some cross-field work, matching up equivalent/redundant ideas and harmonizing terminology. In academia at least, the incentives don't encourage that, though: even though a survey article is probably the single quickest way to have significant impact on a field (they're widely read, and you're forging the lens through which many subsequent people will view that field), they're not as well respected for advancement purposes as even very niche original research is.<p>As it is, tons of stuff keeps getting reinvented just because the state of the literature is so bad that you'll never find it, unless it was invented <i>exactly</i> in your sub-sub-specialty, or you serendipitously found it via a colleague who remarked that what you were doing sounded similar to something he once read.<p>The decline in scientists writing books also doesn't help. It used to be that prominent scientists would gather up their scattered papers and unify them into a magnum opus laying out their theories, or possibly a few different books, one on each major area they worked on. That sometimes happens, especially in areas like cosmology, but it's much less the norm than it was 100 years ago. Today it's quite common to just publish 200+ papers over your career and not really do any summarization of them, even though there is plenty that <i>could</i> often be done, since it's common for papers to supersede or overlap with previous ones.<p>Actually, on that front, it'd be a big win if scientists with lots of publications simply provided some sort of brief guide to them. Take the 50 papers on lasers, and provide an annotated bibliography explaining which papers are the important ones, which papers are obsolete or superseded, and which ones might be of particular interest to people working on particular topics. A few people do that, but many don't even separate their list of publications by topic, let alone provide a guide.<p>Or, shorter: There is a lot of stuff published, but it's <i>terribly</i> indexed and summarized, which I think is a bigger problem than the volume alone.",1284945785

(And I would love to avoid tcsh, as I have my own list of grievances that go far beyond what was listed on that web page.)<p>For some reason -- and I've witnessed this multiple times -- there has been a tendency to use tcsh as a baseline, and then build stuff on top of it that lasts for years.  After awhile, too many scripts assume they can simply ""source"" a csh-style file to set their environment variables and aliases.  And administrators may not even offer standard login files for other shells (which is sad, considering that Bourne-style allows many more shells to work).<p>Pretty soon, your choices are to grudgingly use tcsh, where everything works as intended; or, to use a different shell, and see obscure problems from time to time because of missing settings.<p>So basically, nearly 15 years after this article, I can say that tcsh is alive and well in Unix environments and ""can't"" go anywhere if they were unfortunate enough to use it as a baseline.

I played a lot of video games as a kid, but you know, I turned out alright, and looking back I can not honestly say that I would be in a very different place if I had instead been doing ""worthwhile"" things. In the excellent Hardy Boys story today on HN, adults go back and read their beloved books of their youth and discover they are tripe. Is there necessarily a way around that? I'd be surprised. You can't become a person of taste and discrimination without acquiring taste and discrimination and that necessarily entails a period during which you do not have taste and discrimination. Is there <i>anybody</i> who does not essentially ""fritter away"" their childhood? (Yes, but not very many, and even fewer of them do it by their own choice.) Do we not often feel sorry for those who have been forced to ""not fritter"" away their childhood, do we not often feel sorry for the 15 year old forced to play piano four hours a day, even if it produces spectacular results?
