Also, the stockmarket does not like situations where the owner is cashing out, and much prefers companies that sell stock mostly to re-invest in their business. If Godaddy did an IPO, the owner would not be able to cash out immediately and would have to wait a while and sell his stock slowly and hope he does not cause a collapse in the price.<p>Private equity specializes in these situations (owners wanting to cash out, and companies that may have plateaued or are in decline), so it seems like a good choice.",1284168433

I think that both parties are somewhat to blame if such a situation arises, if it is 'within scope' then a tweak should not end up costing significant amounts of time that indicates a less than general attitude towards coding things, on the other hand there should be some penalty for changing the design after it has been nailed down and agreed on, even if it is within the scope since it will require re-work of at least some portion of the design.<p>I'd probably negotiate a reasonable adjustment of the price in that case (also to dissuade from further tweaks, or to get paid for them), and a note to the effect that the deadlines will be pushed back as a direct consequence of this.<p>I'd also want that documented in email with the consequences clearly stipulated.",1284168021

Or even whether you have a college degree.  Lots of people at Google don't.  If you're still in college it might be an issue, but if you have something to point to you still have a shot at getting into the interview process.<p>The interview process is hard.  I won't lie to you about it.  Even if you belong at Google, there is a good chance of not making it through on the first try.  But your odds are infinitely worse if you don't even try.<p>Speaking personally, I didn't apply to Google for years because the core Google languages are Python, Java and C++, while my professional experience was all in Perl.  Eventually I did apply, and discovered that it never would have been a problem.  And in fact I'm doing most of my work in internal languages that nobody comes here knowing.",1284167440

Also, VPN let's you use the same configurations as you would if you were local to the machines, you don't have to use localhost, etc.<p>And of course, there's also well known performance problems tunneling over SSH because you incur a double hit from the TCP backoff algorithm.  Not to mention that you can't (easily) tunnel udp over SSH....<p>Come to think of it, there's no real comparison.  SSH is a great remote shell protocol, but a shitty VPN protocol (not surprising since it's not * intended* to be a VPN protocol).",1284167102
