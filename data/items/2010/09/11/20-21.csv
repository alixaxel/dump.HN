In the US, teaching methods are NOT optimized for mathematical proficiency. They are designed to implement a ""progressive"" social agenda, ""social justice,"" that puts ""closing the achievement gap"" ahead of all other considerations. The more rigorous the math curriculum, the more obvious our achievement gap, so the progressive ed schools have decided to de-emphasize objectively measurable math performance and emphasize other things that reveal less of an achievement gap.<p>Instead of reasoning through geometry problems and ""finding the measure of angle A,"" which can be easily graded for correctness, we have them increase the amount of time spent ""engaging in mathematical discourse."" (""Who can name a job that uses math?"") Of course all answers are correct so, voila, no more achievement gap.<p>We de-emphasize calculational proficiency--too likely to produce an achievement gap--and emphasize ""conceptual understanding,"" which sounds great and can mean whatever you need it to mean for political purposes. ""Do we all understand that there are many ways to multiply?"" Sure we do!<p>Instead of ""find the answers to these problems,"" our kids are assigned to ""find pictures in magazines of math being used in real life, cut them out, and bring them to class."" This is called ""engagement."" Who can't cut pictures out of magazines? Bye-bye achievement gap, hello social justice.<p>While the East Asians train their primary math teachers in techniques that have been found to maximize math proficiency, our teachers get a very different sort of preparation for teaching out kids:<p><a href=""http://www.city-journal.org/html/8_2_a1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-journal.org/html/8_2_a1.html</a><p>Read the above article, consider what the proficiency-focused Asian schools are doing instead, and imagine the implications for our future.",1284238474

In general, many GA formulations tend to be really naive, choosing parametrizations where (for example) some bits are highly correlated (this is bad because stochastic bit-flipping methods tend to mix very slowly with correlated inputs) in ways that could be fixable with a better parametrization (that would, however, not necessarily fit the ""chromossome"" metaphor).",1284237611

1682265,comment,1681607,1681978,0,0,code_duck,,,"Excellent question. Check out the comments. A few members of the community have questioned why they chose this elaborate process, which actually ended up with the new images actually having noticeably lower quality. This was noticed by the artists themselves, too, as Etsy's customers labor for a long time to get the highest quality photos possible. Etsy's response when this was brought up in the member forums was that they 'learned from this' and would take note for the future... a more satisfying response would be ""we acknowledge that the images are inadequate and we'll re-do them"".<p>Why Etsy thought they had to seek new image algorithms rather than just using the ones they already used is the sort of question they very rarely answer. My analysis is that it is related to the fact that they did the processing on an Amazon server. To save bandwidth, transfer time and processing time, they sent over the medium sized images rather than the original, full size image. Of course, that doesn't explain why they decided to do it in 'the cloud' at all rather than, as you say, just operate directly on the file system, in house.<p>They claim to have gone through an elaborate comparison process, apparently with the visual quality comparison being done by engineers - not people specializing in the non-technical side of photography or graphics. They seem to have entirely missed the quality issue, though it was apparent enough to customers that at least a hundred of them brought it up in the forums once the switch to the new image sizes was made.",1284236370

It's not like every German was evil, or even that most Germans were evil. It was the situation and structure that was evil, and the social proof, and a hundred and one other things, that add up to decent people doing monstrous evil.<p>Character really doesn't matter for as much as a lot of people like to think. Almost everything people do comes down to their incentives and their situation, from the lowest thug to the most noble statesman.
