If I think a company is over priced and I am in charge of executing trades for my investing club, whose members unanimously agreed not to buy the stock in question until it fell down say, $20 more in price - are we colluding?  Yes.  Colluding to price fix?  No.  We're simply colluding not to participate in the buy side.  That may or may not lead to sellers slowly changing their asking price.  But that's a two-way street.  I don't see the illegality according to anti-trust.  Now if every major instututional house/hedge/mutual/pension fund that owned that stock got together and colluded to refuse to SELL us any stock until we agreed to their higher price, that I understand is illegal.  They are fixing the price literally.  But I don't see how us refusing to participate in a transaction on the buy side is illegal whether we have 5 members or 5 million.<p>Saying that the angels are colluding to price fix buys into Michael's assertion that ""together, the men in that room account for nearly 100% of all angel deals"".  That means that their ""deals"" are the commodity in question, and they are free to do as they wish.  If it's their money, then it's hard to make the claim that their money is the market.  There's certainly more money in the world than theirs.",1285127983

If antitrust applied to cost of money, the Federal Reserve would not exist since it's basically an extension of the member banks that make up its institutional board of directors (not board of governers).

That's the only way you write 100 million line applications that run on over a billion computers with over 100,000 unique configurations.  The problem is that if you have the size of dev teams you have on Windows (or presumably at Google), if a dev makes a mistake once every five years, that takes half a day to resolve, the checked-in version is ALWAYS broken. Even with great testing, abstraction layers, etc... mistakes will happen -- sometimes for a given dev even more often than once every five years.<p>""In fact the smaller and more rapid the integration cycle is, the less overall pain there seems to be associated with them.

In my office, we're embarking a series of cleaning up the code because it's a big pile of band-aids. People were told to read ""Working Effectively With Legacy Code"".<p>While the book has been godsend, people's mentality is a different issue. Developers are an interesting bunch; they complain a lot when the code is full of band-aids but they will also back-off when management give a full-blessing to start cleaning up pieces by pieces. The only motivated people to do the task are mostly the new hire.<p>The software is a typical client-server that utilizes a standard/minimum WebService (WS is not as bad as you thought it would be). But here's the weird part: the server is a dumb component. Let me explain via ascii art:<p>Client(GUI, heavy BiznezLogic, heavy Validation) -> WebService (dumb) -> Data Access Layer (dumb) -> Stored Procedure (complex logic and validation).<p>Sort of good separation isn't it? Except it's hard to write unit/integration tests around heavy GUI based software and around Store Procedures. (Of course one could still write integration tests on top of the DAL layer, but we'll never achieve unit-test since we can't test per Stored Procedure).<p>The thing is: we can't drop everything completely and start refactoring (even if it's just a component). The train must continue.<p>I used to dislike consulting, but these days I've been starting to look at that direction. An added benefit of consulting is that you can meet clients and start networking: something that a maintenance developer can't do, cause he's stuck either fixing bugs or refactoring code until late night (and adding more unit-tests).<p>Unfortunately, most jobs are maintaining other people's code unless you're working for a startup or your own project. When you work in a startup, quality usually get pushed. Eventually when you hit year 2.5, you will deal with the same issue again and again.

1715049,comment,1711171,1712744,0,0,grandalf,,,"Here is my argument that making it better would make it cheaper:<p>- Consider what percentage of class time is productive vs babysitting.  Not sure where you went to school but in my jr high and high school years, 60% of the classes were 80% babysitting and 20% teaching.<p>- Now imagine that a school hour could be structured with a 20 minute lecture followed by 40 minutes of supervised study (supervision not necessarily provided by someone capable of teaching the material).  Suddenly you have a >100% efficiency improvement for that hour, since the teacher could be teaching another group and the supervisors can be relatively low skilled.<p>Surely there are some classes/students that would benefit from longer lectures or hour long discussions; the point is intended simply to illustrate that there is substantial waste and inefficiency today.<p>- Why does the school day operate during the typical school hours?  Largely because of the school's dual role as daycare... <i>expensive</i> daycare.  Why not have school hours be 8-noon every day and then make the rest of the day a daycare / study hall staffed by non-teachers?  This could be done without sacrificing any academic quality.<p>- Pay distribution.  Teachers are paid based on seniority.  Switching to merit pay would cut staffing costs significantly while allowing the good ones to be paid a salary competitive with other fields.<p>- Why are classes overcrowded?  Do all classes need to contain 20-30 students?  Why not make some classes contain 150 students and others 10-15 students like in college?  The problem of overcrowding is due to the unrealistic notion that there should be 20-30 bodies in every room during every period.  That doesn't match the distribution of talent and interests, and does not optimize teacher effectiveness.<p>These are just a few ideas.  There are probably many more.",1285125000
1715048,comment,1714184,1714479,0,0,alsomike,,,"""Update profile"" seems more in the style of Computron 5000 to me, but yeah, the move to ""update my profile"" was an attempt to make it friendly and now it has that connotation. But I think it works mostly by making the idea of a dialog (in the sense of conversation) more explicit, not so much about ownership. Like you also started seeing prompts like ""Would you like to...?"" or ""Are you sure you want to delete?"" rather than ""Confirm deletion.""<p>Dialog works because my perception of my interaction with software is that I'm in a dialog with it. When the interface mirrors that idea back to me, there's a fit or congruence and it feels comfortable, in the same way that an ergonomic handle is something like the inverse of the shape of your hand while holding it - I say ""my profile"" so the interface should say the linguistic inverse: ""your profile"". IMO, it has nothing to do with humanness or friendliness or emotion -- which is nice if it's contextually appropriate, but it can be irritating -- and more to do with cognitive ergonomics.<p>The idea of making computers more friendly, like a human, to make them easier to use is kind of a dumb idea when you think about it, like saying screwdriver handles should be shaped like human hands because we find it comfortable to hold someone's hand. Anyway, human-to-human interaction is often very awkward and definitely not intuitive, why should it be the ideal for human-computer interaction?",1285124975
