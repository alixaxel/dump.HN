We had one employee who got distracted into his own geeky pursuits and changed his tool settings frequently with no apparent benefit to the development roadmap. In conclusion I think you have a valid right to set certain standards, and may provide freedom to change but at the developers responsibility, and take measures if things are inclined to get out of control.",1285152902

I've been struggling with exactly the same sort of problem.<p>For a while I was working late nights and making good progress but since having our 2nd kid it has been very difficult to get back into it. Being depressed over the day job and money definitely doesn't help.<p>It's interesting that so many people recommend the mornings. I can see the logic but from a practical point-of-view, I don't think it will work. My kids are v. good and sleep from ~7pm to 7am but they're awake earlier in the mornings and just happy to stay in bed. If I get up at 5 or 6am then I'm going risk waking not only my wife but also rousing the 2 children too. Maybe I'll give it a try next week but I'm sceptical.<p>One thing to bear in mind... when working in the evenings I've found progress is roughly: 1 week of evenings == 1 full-time day.

1715708,comment,1715390,1715480,0,0,lsc,,,"I've lived in Santa Clara and Sunnyvale, both quite near the google campuses in Mountain View.   The cheapest place I lived was a 2 bedroom above the Lawrence expressway train station in Santa Clara.  It was the ""bad part of town""  by the standards of Santa Clara, but I never felt afraid for myself or my belongings.   $1200 a month for the 2 bedroom.  The apartment was kindof falling apart, though.<p>after that, I rented a duplex (a house with a garage that was attached to the garage of another house)  for $1500 a month in a reasonably nice part of Sunnyvale.   Walking distance to downtown.  2 bedrooms and a garage.  Again, the place was old and not particularly well-constructed.   It was reasonably maintained and the cosmetics were dealt with, though.<p>I'm currently in a 2 bedroom apartment, also in sunnyvale, that is very well constructed (good sound insulation, sprinklers, built within the last 20 years)  it's walking distance to the AMD building and Fry's.  It's around $1750 a month.<p>All of these places are between 10 and 30 minutes from google, depending on the traffic.<p>The south bay is quite a bit cheaper and, uh, more 'suburban' than the city.  the thing to watch for is that this place was built as a suburb;  e.g. most of the construction is done pretty poorly, and much of it is old.  We need to knock down some of the old tract homes and build some high rises, but we won't.   Of all the places I've lived around here, this apartment is the first one with properly earthed power.<p>Really, all of Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Santa Clara is pretty safe.  Parts of San Jose can get a little bit more dicey but is still quite a bit better than the city as far as getting your windows broken for a GPS.   If you head north of google, so long as you stay out of east palo alto, you are fine, crime-wise, but it's all pretty expensive (except, of course, east palo alto)<p>Of course, this all depends on your standards.

That changes matters quite a bit, assuming the security issues are really important (having an internally-perceived killer app and worrying about it getting out -> not necessarily very important; working in an industry where competitors regularly steal trade secrets [finance and gambling, for instance], or where regulations/investors demand tight security, -> important!); I would usually be annoyed if I was not allowed to use my personal machine for dev, but if there are legit security requirements, it's a lot more understandable, and I wouldn't have any problems at all using a standardized stack.<p>Honestly, from my point of view I'd be fine with any OS restriction that's not Windows.  It sounds like OS X is not a real option for the work that you need people to do, so it's perfectly reasonable to insist on Linux, and the Thinkpads are very nice machines (I actually quite like the ""nub"" for mouse control), so I don't think you'll hear too many complaints if you offer them.",1285150579
