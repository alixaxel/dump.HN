You can be sure that the professors at your school put some thought into the decision, and even if you disagree, it would take a lot to convince them otherwise. There are so many things to learn, that you should really just start somewhere, anyway. Even if they teach you Java, what you should be learning are programming concepts. You can then apply those any programming problem.<p>Personally, I think C would make a better choice, simply because it forces you to understand the underlying architecture, and appreciate the thinking behind the constructs of slightly higher-level languages. I'm sure I'm in the minority on that, though. Java is a decent choice, however, as it's very generic and allows you to focus on things like data structures and algorithms without necessarily having to go through that steep of a learning curve.",1283305532

Hiring the wrong person is hugely worse than not hiring anyone at all.<p>The easiest hire is someone with whom you've already worked and who is known to be reliable. But once you've exhausted that pool, you're with the rest of us, dealing with the 1000s of resumes from people who don't bother to read the job requirements, the dozens whose experience has at least some vague partial overlap with what you're looking for, and the handful worth interviewing. So, ""we'll just hire a large team"" can be a solution, but before it's a solution, it will be a problem.<p>Ironically, if the tasks to be done are _truly_ independent of each other, then it is easier to scale up development by hiring and working with multiple software developers: they don't have to work with each other, the code one writes has minimal interaction with the code someone else writes, and if someone isn't working out, (s)he can be fired and a replacement found without affecting the rest of the work. Or you can hire contractors for the independent tasks, that might be even easier.<p>(I personally like systems that are more integrated - I think they have a better feel and higher value than a system that's just a collection of tools -  but maybe what you're building fits well with a collection of separable tasks...)",1283305531
1651538,comment,1648839,1648839,0,0,10ren,,,"Just on that advice: 1. try to find less ambitious tasks that still have some excitement for you - that is, the right level of challenge for you; and 2. try to learn how to break down tasks.<p>1. I always find it exciting to see something happen because of my code. It's very basic, like a child playing with blocks. Graphics code is especially good for this; and there's also javascript that creates a  webpage; or  simply printing something on the screen (terminal/console). Combine a few steps together, and you can have something cool, even though it's simple.<p>2. breaking tasks down is how you ""get to the point of being able to attack something"". This ""divide-and-conquer"" is crucial - absolutely crucial - throughout all computer science (and every other complex activity). This is not a skill you should expect to automatically have perfectly mastered, but it's one you already have the beginnings of and that you can practice to improve it. For a start, you could look at any task (of any kind), and ask yourself how it could be broken down into simpler steps - often, it will be obvious to you. Now, break down one of those subtasks again, and keep going until you have a task that you are 100% sure you can do. Then focus on that one task to the exclusion of the rest of it. This is difficult. Try to pretend that the original task and all the other subtasks and sub-subtasks etc don't exist; and when you have solved this one task, observe that you've made progress and congratulate yourself. Only after this little celebration of real progress should you go on to the next step.<p><pre><code>    If you want to hit a bird on the wing, you must have all your will in\n    focus, you must not be thinking about yourself, and equally, you\n    must not be thinking about your neighbor: you must be living in your\n    eye on that bird. Every achievement is a bird on the wing.\n</code></pre>\nThis might not suit your temperament, but it's <i>the</i> way to accomplish things that are too complex/overwhelming for you. Once you're encountered one kind of problem a few times (or maybe even once), it can become intuitively obvious to you, and so you won't have to break it down so far next time. You have grown!<p>But be warned: there <i>always</i> be things that are too complex for you, and that you'll have to break them down. The skill of breaking things down is essential.",1283305531

Perhaps state universities once (< 80's) charged very little because they (1) got lots of money from the government with the mandate of providing affordable education and (2) students didn't have access to grants/loans to pay more anyway.<p>Now, the ""price"" is higher (which is used to create the graphs in the linked article), but the effective cost for the student hasn't increased quite as proportionally because he has a government voucher to use.<p>Greatly oversimplified, I know.  We understand what someone means when he talks about the average price of a gallon of gas at a gas station, but we don't have a common definition for the ""price"" of education.  Out of pocket not counting grants/scholarships?  Do we discount the cost if the loans are at a below-market rate because of government guarantees?<p>Heck, even the gallon of gas ""price"" is hard to define.  Marathon gives me back 5% on gas purchased with my Marathon card.  What's my average price per gallon?",1283304242

The return on investment for a college education may be less than what it once was, but the net present value of a bachelor's degree is still positive.  That's an economic argument predicated on the proposition that an education's function is solely to develop human capital, thereby increasing productive capacity of the person and enabling that person to earn more for their services relative to what they would have earned without a degree.<p>This, of course, ignores another significant component of economic behavior regarding education.  Specifically, in addition to it's vocational value, education is a service purchased to meet the human need for self-actualization.  When you see a human-interest article in the local news about a 70 year old grandmother who has just completed her bachelor's degree, you are seeing evidence of economic demand for education that has no vocational basis.<p>I am not saying that the existing trend of the cost of tuition outpacing CPI can continue indefinitely.
