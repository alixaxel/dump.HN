It's not hard to design a system where <i>most</i> is functional, though, <i>and that's still useful</i>. You've probably done that without considering it ""functional programming""TM, just trying to cut out global variables and whatnot. Decades ago, ""structured programming"" was the new thing, and manifestos appeared about how gotos were ""considered harmful"".<p>If you have a system where 95% of it is functional, cool, you've eliminated 95% of the places where you have to double-check for dataflow/mutability-related bugs. (To heavily paraphrase jerf's comment: functional programming is about accepting restrictions that make debugging simpler.) Make the system as clean as feasible, but don't get bent out of shape trying to get the last 5% FP-approved. It's probably less trouble to just know that's the hairy part.<p>The big idea in functional programming is that working with immutable data structures makes a lot of annoying bugs go away, and <i>goddamnit, they're right</i>. Does that mean you need to go 100% immutable? No - it's just a good default.<p>FP-style programming without (generational) garbage collection is really awkward, though - immutability means you're going to be creating a lot of temporary data structures. Good language implementations will recognize this and just stack-allocate them or let them go in the first collection.",1285822075

I've founded and sold (as CEO) a few companies in the last 10 years, and I'm in my mid-30s.<p>We recently hired a 50 something marketing guy; not my preferred hire based on his skills (mostly mid-size business, no tech, no startups). We've been in an uneasy detente since he joined; his first act was to tell me to change our domain name -- mine was to mail him back and tell him he needed to work with me and show some respect, to start by not demanding I do low skill tech jobs.<p>I work remotely, he works with in the same office as the CEO... You can imagine where the story goes from here. He recently asked for a 3x bump in his stock allocation and suggested that his salary be pegged to mine. I told him that it was absolutely not possible on the equity side, it was out of market rates for his job, and that we already had an agreement on these things.<p>Since then it's been sulking, complaining, etc. He pulled out a real winner today when he said in a management meeting that we shouldn't show customers our new product for feedback because that's what Commodore did and then they went broke.<p>I interrupted (see, I'm not blameless here!), and said it wasn't Commodore. He said it was, I offered to make him a gentlemanly bet, and he responded ""you were in diapers.""<p>My co-founder watched in bemusement.<p>I've made my case that I think this guy is not worth the pay and trouble internally with the CEO; while he's not a key hire, I certainly am. I have no idea what the company would do without me, but I'm getting to a point where I think that life is just too short to put up with schmucks who are rude and intimidated by a younger, significantly more successful player in their space.<p>Since I'm remote, I clearly am going to be at a political disadvantage, and I'm not sure how to proceed:<p>Here's my working list right now:<p>1) Let this guy sink his own ship by cutting all internal support out from under him -- he thinks he's so good; he can prove it.<p>2) Trash him on the board, and try and get some motivation to find a better fit.<p>3) Have a heart to heart with the CEO and tell him I'll be on my way soonishly unless this guy shapes up.<p>All these have some obvious drawbacks; I need the income in the near-term, so I can't threaten to walk immediately, nor do I wish to leave the company our customers, or my co-founder in that situation, as it would certainly jeopardize our fundraising.<p>Both 1 and 2 are just different politics angles, something I absolutely hate, and a large part of the reason I'm in the startup game.<p>I would not personally allow a management team to bicker and insult each other as CEO, but I'm not in charge here, so I'm stuck to my own devices.<p>Okay HN, pay me back with advice! I could certainly use it. Thanks in advance.",1285821685

Thank you so much for articulating this.<p>I'd like to add that historical site analytics should always be a factor in the web developer's decision to support IE6 or not - and in my experience, B2B companies almost always have 40+ percent of users still on IE6.<p>Yes, we all want IE6 to die.  Yes, it makes life harder for us in the development community.<p>But telling a client that ""you can save money on your website if we ignore IE6"" is inherently disingenuous, unless your client is already a web technologies expert (and if they're outsourcing web development, I'm doubting that this is the case).  Nine times out of ten, the client will jump on the cost-saving opportunity, you will avoid the hassle of developing for backwards compatibility, and you'll feel good for having just stabbed IE6 in the kidney.  But when the client's site analytics say that 40% of the customer base is still on IE6 (and this is typical in my experience) then you'll be costing them FAR more in lost business than you'll be saving them in web development costs.<p>I hate IE6 too... but there's more to it than just the added cost of development - and as stated earlier, many users simply don't have a choice in the matter.",1285820699

The fact that we found a planet that is even anything like the Earth at all orbiting another star only 20 light years away makes me extremely optimistic that earthlike planets are everywhere  in our galaxy. 20 light years is practically in our lap compared to the vast size of our galaxy, so statistically speaking, it seems very likely it’s not unique. I don’t want to extrapolate from a data set of two (us and them), but if this is typical, there could be millions of such planets in the galaxy. Millions.""",1285820647

A visitor that spends hours on the site each day, producing content in the form of discussion, is worth a lot more than a visitor that drops in for two minutes in order to spew some spam into the queue, and then leave. I don't think there's any question that the reddit community is more engaged than the digg community...a brief perusal of the comments at both sites will quickly eliminate any doubt.<p>As for revenue, I said that more pageviews and much faster growth from a much leaner organization was better. There were several variables in my statements.<p>Besides, it is not a small difference in pageviews. It's ~40%! Which pretty much certainly equates to more visits and more unique visitors than digg.<p>No matter how you slice it, though, digg is a 100+ person operation that is generating less value to consumers than a 6 person operation. Value to consumers is a reasonable proxy for the kind of revenue you can generate from a site. They just haven't found the formula for monetizing it yet.
