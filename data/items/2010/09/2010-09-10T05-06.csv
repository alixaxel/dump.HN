(with the number of employees, one guy can really make a big difference, and if we are operating properly, we grow by around 10-15% a month.)<p>hm.  It seems I could pay out on random days on a month that beats the previous months receipts?  I think I'd want it to be a 'peak month' rather than  a 'peak day' to discourage gaming, I mean, I see how you could queue up customers for a few days... doing this over months could be bad, especially if when the months begin changes randomly.<p>But yeah, a formula that people can know, with, perhaps, random numbers that aren't known until the period end sounds like the way to go.  I think people would mind the manipulation less if it was clear what I was doing and why.",1284098370
1678027,comment,1677837,1677837,0,0,Groxx,,,"Ya know what helps a <i>lot</i>?<p>Reinstalling the OS (edit: from scratch. ie, format the drive + install).  I make a point to do so at least once per year.  OSX has aged <i>significantly</i> more gracefully than Windows, despite having several times as many files (approached 3 million near the end), but a two-year-old install (I slacked) is <i>nothing</i> like a fresh one.  Especially noticeable: Spotlight actually finds what I'm looking for in less than a second again (vs upwards of a minute or more).<p>It also highlights the differences between the OSes: OSX handles loads and loads of applications at the same time with significantly less slowdown and zero waiting on the UI.  Windows launches and handles a single application <i>much</i> more quickly, but it's not uncommon to wait a significant amount of time for a single click to register if I launch a couple large ones at once.  Just today I've had to sit for a couple minutes because a large compile+launch decided to happen at the same time as a browser crash and an application auto-updating.  Win 7 utterly stopped responding, except for my mouse cursor's movement.<p>edit: to all repliers suggesting Linux: yes it does, if you consider reinstalling to be ""reinstalling from scratch"", which was what I had meant (though not stated, apologies).  Every OS slows with extensions + libraries + millions of files + hundreds of compiled applications, and I'm likely a bit of an edge case anyway.  I pretty easily install 1000+ applications per year for experimenting, many of which add extra cruft that no uninstaller removes completely.",1284098319

The main help, I think, comes from the hard drive.</i>""<p>He's totally right about using an SSD as the boot disk, I can't overstate how much of a difference it makes, more than RAM, CPU or anything else. I've been using one for a while and it made my secondhand 3-4 year old macbook pro go from <i>barely usable for design work</i> to <i>screaming top of the line</i>.<p>I'm probably going to switch to a hybrid drive soon though, like the 500GB Momentus XT that comes with a 4GB SSD glued on. The big drawbacks of using a pure SSD as a boot disk are that you'll either 1) run out of space on the SSD and/or 2) forced to keep the data on a slower separate drive, assuming that you're going with a moderately priced one and not spending a gazillion dollars for one of the big ones with a lot of capacity. #2 might not matter to the OP because he said he upgraded his rig just for the web browsing, but designers like me routinely load up and work with large files, so I still get the beach ball every time Fireworks tries to open a file or save it. This is where I differ from the OP and the Jeff Atwood article he linked to: <i>I'd rather put all of my data on just as fast a disk as the one with the OS and apps</i>. The slowdown in opening large files is super annoying after you've gotten used to the near instant times for booting the OS and starting up apps.<p>If I had one of the newer MBPs that came with a SATA interface for the optical drive (instead of IDE like mine), I'd seriously consider splurging and going with Stammy's dual RAID SSD setup:<p><a href=""http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-apple-macbook-pro-raid-0-array-with-2-intel-x25-m-ssds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-apple-macbook-pro-raid-0-arr...</a><p>Even though I can't use it for RAID, I'm still going to swap out the optical drive for an older IDE-compatible MCE optibay with a generic 500GB drive just for backups with time machine and super duper.
