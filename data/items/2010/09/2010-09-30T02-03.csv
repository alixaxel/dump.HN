> I'll put it this way--if you made a $250 IRA contribution in 2005, it would have to be worth $1,500,000 today to match that return.<p>If you invested one penny that investment would now need to be worth $60 to match that return.  Maybe it is just me, but $250 to $1.5M doesn't help me visualize a 6000x return at all.  This analogy reminds me of an old Dennis Miller bit from Saturday Night Live where to illustrate the size of the national debt he takes out a dollar bill and says ""it would take stack of these 3 trillion high to pay it back"".",1285815564

So you can have great novels that languish, and massive movies that are rubbish.<p>The idea of ""what can be easily changed"" is significant, and is the basis of Parnas' influential paper on <i>information hiding</i>: you hide the decisions that are likely to change, so when they are changed, their impact is isolated from the rest of the system. Decisions that are expected to change together are grouped together in <i>modules</i>: <a href=""http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/criteria.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2003/cmsc838p/Design/crite...</a>
This is perhaps <i>the</i> most influential comp sci paper, and it's an interesting read; no maths IIRC, and pretty straightforward.<p>I think ""raw materials vs. tools"" is not as helpful as ""what can be easily changed"", because the materials/tools distinction can always be made arbitrary. eg: compiler vs. interpreter for the same language. One is a ""tool"", the other ""raw material"". A difference in performance (usually); but equal difficulty in changing them (you have to rewrite your code.)<p>A related question is: once you have modules, with fixed interfaces between them, what if you got it wrong (different decisions need to change) and you have to change the interfaces and modules? Because ""what you think will change"" is a prediction. It's a hunch, or if you like,  <i>guessing</i>. Your hunches improve with experience, both in a specific domain, and in general; but you will always be guessing. Or you <i>should</i> be; because if you know the answer, you should have automated it, bought/reused a tool that automates it, or made a tool that automates it and started selling it/giving it away.<p>As I said: great questions. For learning, they really are more important than great answers.",1285815546

1742020,comment,1741292,1741905,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"I think the best move by FB was buying FriendFeed in Aug '09 a few years after knocking back Yahoo and making Bret Taylor CTO and having Paul Bucheit cultivate an engineering culture. I was surprised by this, because Taylor originally stated he wanted FF to grow into a self-sustaining company. If FB didn't have the pockets to do this, FB wouldn't be nearly as successful as it is today. Today FB is impressively fast, were Tornado + HipHop the keys for this to happen?<p>If Twitter fixed its UI and fail whales a few years ago, it'd be much bigger today. PG a year or two ago spoke of Twitter as a protocol: yet still I think this hasn't manifested as it's still only  used at the presentation layer. It should have or should still look into this path.<p>Increasingly I'm seeing outcomes determined by the smarts of the CEO who end up having to think for themselves, because eventually they get surrounded by Yes-people. I see a deficit at Google with Eric Schmidt, although I can't say I've met him, Google needs a Jobs at this point. FB just need to put in a search engine (Bing?,) to stop losing users to Google.<p>If I may continue, the FF acquisition basically allowed FB to compete with Twitter (and not lose users to it.) It was Twitter that undermined Digg, because sharing with people you know is more fun than with sharing people you don't know.<p>The lessons in strategy here with Digg, Facebook, (and also Yahoo's non-acquisition by MS) is that if a potential acquirer comes to you having in mind that your business be acquired to spearhead or enable massive growth of their own, you say no. Or rather, if they're more (or even less) excited about your business than you are, sell unless you can obtain that excitement somehow, perhaps by acquiring yourself.",1285813330
