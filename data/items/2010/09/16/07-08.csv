Most decisions are made by results from experiments. Google is able to do this because the economies of scale. They have tons of data. As a matter of fact, the ""experimental traffic"" is higher than 100%, indicating multiple levels of experiments are conducted in every search (on average). I remember the quote from a session ""A/B testing is for marketers. Engineers run multivariate experiments.""<p>In terms of traditional designers: their process is more of an art than science. They think, and trust their instincts. They traditionally operate in a setting that can't afford this kind of experiments.<p>The reality is people are weird and unpredictable. It's statistics and hard science when it's backed by data.<p>The challenge, of course, is that it is easy to iterate incrementally using measurement data.

1697094,comment,1696921,1696921,0,0,dotBen,,,"I honestly don't know if these two are in genuine need or not but I know how easy it is to get caught up in these things and your heart rules over you head, and that's how even the least gullible people can get duped.<p>So let me ask a few questions for your consideration (I'm originally from London so most of this is with domain knowledge):<p>1) I'm surprised to hear homeless people hanging out on Picadilly in Mayfair.  Rightly or wrongly they often get moved on as that area is up-market, as you know.  Therefore homeless people hanging around there are quite often the opportunistic ones who come in to the area to sit for as long as they can because they know that they'll be passed by some of the most affluent folks in London and so the chances of getting money is greatest.<p>If these two were genuinely homeless then they would have been moved on from that area so you have to wonder whether they were instead grifting.  A popular grift in that area is for a guy to come up to you and say he got a call that his wife is having their baby in the hospital so he was driving on his way there but his car ran out of petrol and he forgot to bring his wallet.. could he have £5?  That is a <i>classic</i> grift in Mayfair and The City because £5 is nothing to most people there and I've had it pulled on me a few times without success.<p>It's worth nothing that a lot of grifters will take the tube into the city, pretend to be homeless, take £200+ a day, and then take the tube back out to the suburbs where they live. That's £50k+/year tax free and will rent you a house!  That kind of grifting is pretty common esp in the touristy areas.<p>2) If they are from Transylvania then they are Romanian, which makes them EU citizens.  As a homeless + pregnant EU citizen she would probably be entitled to emergency support from social services.  If he has worked here an paid NI then they would almost certainly qualify.<p>May I ask if they represented themselves as ""Transylvanian"" or ""Romanian"" because if someone tells me they are Romanian then I would immediately say that they are EU. If you say ""Transylvania"" then it sounds more obscure/etc - which is also a classic confidence trick.  Transylvania is not a country and so it would be an odd place to announce you are from in a foreign country.<p>3) Creating an artificial sense of urgency is another confidence trick (like the ""my wife is having a baby"" example above).  Calling you at 1am and saying they have no bed tomorrow seems to be in line with that. Why did they call/text at such a late hour and not in the morning?<p>4) I had a friend who owned a number of flats in a building and he let some homeless people stay there to 'get back on their feet'. Instead of utilizing his kindness to get on top of things as quickly as possible they just dossed and squatted there as long as they could and then when he got pushy to have them leave they trashed the place and tried to set it alight.  Even if these two are real, some people have unusual mentalities in which they can only use help to survive and don't have the ability to use it to get back on their feet. In other-words two weeks in a B&B might just take their burden off for two weeks rather than actually use it to get to the next level.<p>My ultimate advice would be to contact social services for Kensington and Chelsea (which I believe to be the borough for that area, see <a href=""http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/housing/homelessness.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/housing/homelessness.aspx</a>), who frankly are well resourced compared to other boroughs. It might be they have to go back to the borough where they last lived but as a pregnant woman they would probably assist her with that.<p>I would also contact Shelter and other homeless organizations as I bet they would take her on priority as she is pregnant.<p>(Assuming she <i>is</i> pregnant, which is another classic grift.)<p>Perhaps I'm being overly cautious, verging on negative above, but it sounds like you're pretty taken in and so I'm just trying to create some balance.  I'm also minded that with so much resources and support for homeless people in London, certainly compared to here in San Francisco where there is nothing, there is no real reason for anyone to be homeless in Central London unless they are refusing assistance, are drug-dependent and won't enter rehab or are grifting.<p>I was going to leave out my judgment and leave this to you to decide, but I decided to add post-edit: it's almost certainly a grift. Esp waiting outside the Ritz, which you present as being ironic/juxtaposition but that's probably by design. The 1am text seems grifty too (totally unnecessary time to text, false sense of urgency).<p>I think the best thing you can do right now is to help them with access to these services rather than giving them money.  If they are real they'll accept the help and if they are grifting the'll push you a mile away because they know its a  route to getting caught.<p>Let us know what happens!",1284622106

Since then, it has evolved into my consultancy that I now do full-time (in fact, my latest creation, LeadNuke, is a ""product of Alfa Jango, LLC"", and may be spun off if I decide to take any investment for it).<p>Forming an LLC really is not very difficult, and it's good practice to get started early if you plan on going full-time at some point. More importantly, the clarity boundaries it provides to your business expenses and taxes is worth the effort alone.<p>Single-person LLCs are legit and can protect your personal liability IF you run it like a legit company. People who form single-person LLCs have a tendency to get lazy with record-keeping and procedures. Don't fall into this trap. If someone sues you, and the judge looks over your records and says, ""Yeah, but you didn't do anything differently than if you hadn't formed an LLC,"" personal liability protection is gone. This means, setup a separate business bank account for ALL business income/expenses, sign ALL contracts with your business name, make sure clients address checks and issue your 1099s to your business name, etc.<p>Concerning insurance, I wouldn't bother unless you're working on a project that has the potential to lose a lot of money if you do something wrong. If you work on an ecommerce application for a company that will be doing $50k or more sales a month through it, perhaps insurance starts looking like a good idea (god forbid you accidentally leave their merchant account in test mode when you deploy, and no one catches it for a week).<p>If you do get insurance, what you actually want is called Errors and Omissions insurance (liability insurance is for if you have a physical office and you want to protect against your equipment if there's a fire, or if a client visits and slips and breaks their arm). If you get E&O insurance, be sure to shop around, many of the big insurance companies won't do it for you, because of how new and unknown the web-based software industry is, so you might have to go with a smaller local insurance company to work out some policy that fits your needs.<p>EDIT: I should clarify that in Michigan, forming an LLC is incredibly easy. I'm not sure about California, if that's where you are.",1284622089
