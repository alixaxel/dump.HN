I cannot even recall a time when someone wanted a pro-rata refund.<p>The only thing you'll have to deal with is the ""receipt"" often reminds people they want to unsubscribe, so you have to decide how strict you'll be with the no-refunds policy in that case. We typically refund them since we don't email ahead of time about the renewal.<p>We also allow people to ""deactivate"" accounts to resurrect later. We have had people come back alive many times, and I doubt if we deleted everything that they would have bothered to start up again.",1284609539

One of the most fascinating results of the experience was the degree to which my ability to reason degraded.<p>This helps reinforce a thought I've been playing around with since my 20's. It seems quite ridiculous to me that reason is set in conflict with emotion (a remnant, I believe, of the historical conflict of science contra religion in the west). It is much more likely that the ability to reason is a subset of emotion, i.e., reasoning is nothing more than the development of particular emotions working in concert. This conception is more aligned with how evolution actually operates (building upon the processes of before) rather than having to explain a ""magical"" reason which just appears out of nowhere in the human mind and dominates the animal nature.<p>Just a thought...I hope you were able to deal with your illness well.",1284609475

1696752,comment,1695843,1696661,0,0,grellas,,,"The evidence as summarized by the court in the preliminary injunction ruling suggested that the only real basis of potential liability had to do with potential breaches of fiduciary duty relating to a possible joint venture of the parties to develop the underlying product. Generally, an aggrieved party can elect to pursue recovery either of the benefits received by the wrongdoing party (i.e., FG's profits from sales of the product) or of the losses it sustained in connection with its investment of time and effort into the product. In either case, where the product is essentially dead, the dollars recoverable would be quite small.<p>A lost profits measure sounds appealing but would not apply. When a business or venture has no track record upon which to measure such profits with some degree of reliability, courts reject such a measure as speculative.<p>Thus, the damage recovery here is likely to be trivial in comparison to the costs of pursuing the case. Moreover, under U.S. law (in contrast to U.K.), a prevailing party cannot force the other party to pay its attorneys' fees unless, among other possible but unusual bases, there is a contract specifying that a prevailing party gets such an award. Here, there was no written contract and hence no attorneys' fees provision. Thus, after a trial, each party would likely have to bear its own own attorneys' fees in the case.<p>The major remedy - where the underlying product is a viable one - is an in-kind remedy by which TC could get a permanent injunction against FG barring it from selling or distributing the product itself. Again, this is meaningless where the product has no intrinsic worth.<p>Finally, even if damages were meaningful, an entity such as FG would very likely be judgment proof, meaning that it would have no assets upon which to execute any judgment.<p>Thus, TC's goals in this lawsuit, especially as framed by sophisticated counsel, really have nothing to do with the specific legal remedies it might get, as these have no real worth against this defendant or for this product.",1284608685

1696740,comment,1696071,1696383,0,0,ionrock,,,"Personally, I'd avoid node.js. It is most definitely cool, interesting and has been proving itself useful, but (!) there are a lot of details that won't come up until you really need them. If you're focusing on business logic and you already have a rather large set of applications that are relatively ""bleeding edge"", then I'd stick to a language that has a bit more history on the basics.<p>It is the really simple things like form parsing and cookies/sessions that may not be fully fleshed out in Node.js. Not that it won't be soon, but it is a nightmare to spend time on low level issues when you don't have to. This has always been the issue trying new languages and frameworks for projects. I get part of the way there and realize that some basic aspect of web development hasn't been done. Sometimes I start to handle the issues, but if the project is something I want to finish, it usually ends up with me turning back to Python. This might be a bad reflection on myself, but when you want to get something done that doesn't need the latest/greatest tech, it is nothing but frustrating to hit your head against a wall doing basics.<p>Just my two cents!",1284608202
1696739,comment,1695826,1696345,0,0,sophacles,,,"You are assuming that it is a term that can be understood strictly from first principles. With an idiom, such an assumption is silly, as idioms come to their meaning based on a series of historical events, accidental mis-uses, literary uses (and therefore references) and certain assumed shared views.<p>So to understand why witch hunt actually makes sense as a term, you must first look at the real witch hunts that happened. These happened at a time and place where witchcraft was ""known"" to be real. Of course there weren't witches, but everyone then thought there were, so effectively hunting for witches was a valid thing to do.<p>At the time, they also didn't know lots of other things, so if a person falls sick, or a cow dies, or a house burns down, scientific evidence based explanations were not so easy to come by. However witches were ""known"" to curse people, and a curse causes misfortune.<p>So what would happen is a random person would decide to pay back a grudge, or look good to his fellow citizens or whatever, and accuse some 3rd party of witchcraft, for something like giving the evil eye, or dancing, or whatever. This would lead to a burning, and everyone would be happy again. Most of the time anyway. Sometimes, a series of unfortunate events would be construed as a major witch, or a whole coven of witches. Then everyone would go crazy, true beleivers would be terrified, ambitious social climbers would be accusing all their enemies of witchcraft, and so on. There would be attempts by authorities to get to the bottom of it, and many witches would be found. Mass burnings ensued, and eventually everyone would calm down and be happy again.<p>So, looking back, this whole course of events is ridiculous, the root assumption of witchcraft is just plain silly. The mass panic/hysteria over it downright dangerous, and those taking advantage of the situation were repugnant.<p>So, now, looking at the above situations, and refactoring a bit, so we can get a more generic algorithm, we see these key components:<p>1. A label that classifies someone as bad<p>2. A deep underlying fear of what the bad label stands for, but the fear must be non-specific.<p>3. A set of actions and vaguely sort-of correlated events (if you squint just right), that looks like: ""bad things from #2 are happening to us!"".<p>4. A set of people willing to manipulate the many for their own gain.<p>If those conditions are met, you have a prime candidate for a ""witch hunt"" (keeping the name because it describes the original stuff well, and everyone knows what happened in those cases). Just start sending authorities after anyone labeled as the bad thing.<p>There are of course some variations, and deeper nuances, but that is the gist of it.",1284608131

Very few people seem to remember BeOS, and how Toshiba (IIRC) shipped thousands of computers with BeOS and Windows, but because of Microsoft's OEM agreements there was no boot menu, so very few people used the BeOS partition.  Had those agreements not been in place, we might see a lot more use of CP/M-86, BeOS, or other operating systems.<p>It's quite strange that the Criticism of Microsoft page doesn't even mention BeOS.<p>There's also the incident of designing Windows to crash if run on DR-DOS (they didn't simply not support it, they went out of their way to crash on purpose).<p>--<p>Regarding the complaints about capitalism and ""ruined lives,"" I think it might be helpful to decide whether one wants to maximize, minimize, or ignore the worst case, average case, and best case quality of life.

If the parties have taken action in reliance on the agreement, as in the case Riley v. Capital Airlines, Inc. the court held that part performance does not take an executory portion of contract out of the Statute of Frauds. Each performance constitutes a contract that falls outside the Statute of Frauds and was enforceable to the extent it is executed. But the unexecuted portion of the contract falls within the Statute of Frauds and is unenforceable. As a result, only the executed portion of the contract can be recovered, and the doctrine of part performance does not remove the contract from the statute. On the other hand, the court in Schwedes v. Romain held that partial performance and grounds for estoppel  can make the contract effective.</i><p>If I am reading that right: Because they used TC office space it is implied that a contract existed and Statute of frauds does not apply to that part.",1284606775

You could make it illegal to pick up someone on the street and regulate it so that most if not all meetups would occur either online or by someone calling a number they found in a phone book.  I would think that it could be set up so that finding a prostitute goes similarly to finding a contractor, or anyone else in the home service industry.  Other than hiring someone from the parking lot of Home Depot you don't generally see contractors soliciting.  Additionally advertising could be regulated so that you don't see it happening unless you look for it.
