So I created a PayPal account and transferred $100 in from a bank account.  I then tried to make a purchase, but found that as an outside-the-US user, I would not be able to make payments until I registered a credit card with them.  I couldn't qualify for a credit card at the time... oh well.  So I tried to move the money back to my bank account.  But that transaction was covered by the same policy; I wouldn't be able to do it until I registered a credit card with them.<p>Looking through the ToS, I found that this rule was in there; an international user had to register a credit card in order to disburse any funds from the account.  So the fool in this story is indisputably me.  Still, I found it hard to believe that the system was set up to allow black hole accounts, which money could enter but never leave.  Over a lengthy email exchange, I was assured that such accounts were indeed possible, and that I had created one.<p>Eventually I let go of the $100.  But I never let go my scorn for PayPal.",1283713177

1664927,comment,1664750,1664750,0,0,TylerJewell,,,"I am a Heroku fan.  Some things for you to consider:
1) The real value of Heroku is time savings.  Their deployment mechanism is near instant, so your savings come from the time you are spending doing more development, rather than managing servers.  If you wanted to hire an ops person, that's a cost savings.<p>2) Scalability.  As your system grows, Heroku manages architecture choices necessary for scaling all parts of your app.  This is at the dyno web tier and database tier.  But it also includes choices around architecting add-ons.  For example, if you wanted to include their memcache add-on and you had multiple apps, should you create multiple memcache instances or one large grid?  That sort of choice is handled behind the scenes.<p>3) Add-Ons.  They handle configuration, billing, and setup of any add-ons you might need.  Biggest savings is not having to research all of them to figure out which ones are stable, viable, functional.<p>4) Cheap to get started.  You can deploy new apps for free, and migrate your code elsewhere if needed.<p>5) Their polyglot strategy is interesting, and they are pushing the envelope with beta implementations around nosql data stores.  There is a nice polyglot post on their blog.<p>6) There is some performance advantages of using some of their add-ons.  Because Heroku is deployed on EC2, and many of the add-ons are also on EC2, the integrated performance can be higher.  EC2 ping rates are faster than gigabit ethernet in some cases.<p>7) Creating identical environments.  If you manage your own servers and you need to create staging, QA, or development servers, you'd have to create those manually and they'd be close, but not identical because there is different hardware involved.  In debugging scenarios, being able to clone a whole app environment has some advantages.<p>Good luck in your endeavor.",1283712576

1664902,comment,1660360,1663374,0,0,perigrin,,,"The CPAN ecosystem provides some basic guarantees that I haven't seen mentioned for other language's repositories. For example every distribution uploaded to the CPAN is tested on some subset of (using last month's statistics[1]) 15 different operating systems, across 81 platforms, and 26 different versions of Perl. Not every package is tested on every perl and every platform because this is a volunteer effort, but the major platforms (Linux, Windows, BSD, Solaris) are generally covered. These test results are aggregated and reported on search.cpan.org.<p>Every package uploaded is given a Bug Queue (rt.cpan.org) so bugs and patches can be reported to the author. Additionally distributions can now specify in their metadata (META.yaml/META.json) the source code repository for the code so you can see from search.cpan.org the place to get the latest code to patch against. Additionally there is a process that if a maintainer goes rogue and stops responding, packages can be taken over. This doesn't happen often but has been used when other options fail. Many modern projects have several co-maintainers who can all make releases lowering the ""bus factor"".<p>Right now the biggest problem is finding the wheat for all the chaff. Sturgeon's Law applies, 90% of everything is crap. With 21038 (as of this writing) unique distributions, finding the ones that are well written, useful, and generally ""best"" is actually a difficult problem.

When a peer crashes, for example, and then comes back, its partners don't see the problem.  Messages get queued, and then delivered.  This works for the main socket types and transports (but not PAIR and inproc:)<p>This lets us do things like start clients and THEN start a server... the clients automatically connect when the server comes along.  The server can go away, be replaced by another on the same endpoint, and clients will gracefully and invisibly start talking to the new server.<p>In some cases this is precisely what we want, in other cases it's not.  If we need to detect dead peers, we add heartbeating as a message flow on top of 0MQ.  Most larger 0MQ applications currently do this.  Eventually 0MQ sockets may offer heartbeating, it seems a natural evolution.

If your service dies while processing a request, your client if it does a blocking read will hang forever.

Just doing that is worth gold, as you can see from people actually using 0MQ, who consistently tell us, ""this makes our life orders of magnitude easier, thank you"".<p>And as we solve the core problems properly, we'll continue to address other aspects, either in 0MQ core or in layers on top of that, and this process will continue ad infinitum.",1283711669

You increase the risk of breaking on a future upgrade. You could lock yourself out, perhaps, and there's a cost associated with this. In the worst case a distribution upgrade will fix a security hole and you'll be left with it (say for example because you modded the config file, dpkg queried it, you rushed through the prompts and it got left alone).<p>I accept my scenario is unlikely, but it is also unlikely that someone will crack your up-to-date machine using distribution standard ssh, a secure root password and public keys for day-to-day access.<p>It is far more likely that someone will access your secure machine from an insecure place with a keylogger running and get cracked that way.",1283711285

When I say that our startup, IActionable, is in ""the Cloud"" I'm referring to our use of Windows Azure, MS's cloud, and the distributed nature of our service, meaning that we can elastically scale within the resources of MS's cloud and boast some level of stability like a large company while only having to pay for the resources we use. Apps running within Azure, Amazon's cloud, Force.com, Google's App Engine, or Rackspace's cloud are ""in the cloud"" according to this definition.<p>I've noticed, however, that many people say they are in ""the Cloud"" where they define the cloud as a server on the internet. Their thinking goes that since they store all the information remotely and there is nothing on the client's computer, their client-server architecture makes them ""in the cloud"".
