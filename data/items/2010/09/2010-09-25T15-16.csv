Gigabit wired and N-wireless are both valid reasons to upgrade, if you're going from 10/100 and G-wireless.<p>- Power usage - if you need gigabit networking and have very few devices, it makes sense to not run an older router and a gig switch - consolidating to one device is power efficient and probably pulls less power than older devices.<p>There are probably plenty of other reasons, but these came to mind immediately.",1285430146

Is your product making a difference in someone's life? Who are your customers? The difference between these two approaches explains why college grad developers go into finance thinking they'll work on 'neat' problems and a few years later hate they jobs because at the end, their contribution to society is simply a number that indicates profit and not a single person's life has been significantly affected.

You're getting upset at all the big blockbuster stuff.  The things that have little to no plot but yet rake in billions of dollars.

I mean, look at ycombinator and all their startups.  Things like Facebook, Twitter,etc; their popularity is only natural because we all can't design a website.  They give the average joe the tools that they need and they go crazy with it.  The more money they make, the better, because it gives the little guys the chance to make something better.

I can talk about those two <i>all day</i>.<p>The principle behind my idea for language documentation is that logging diversity, in one Nigeria-wide record, also underscores the equality of the Nigerian people as a whole, across religious, linguistic and clan divides. Right now most people identify with one of few macro-clans, something that aborted our own Somali state.<p>Documenting dialects and noting the nuanced differences between people makes an amusement, a public spectacle if you will, of what could otherwise have been a matter of tribal pride and differentiation to feel superior over others. I didn't become a ""Somali"" until I saw the British records, and how identical we were to them.<p>Empower the minority sub-cultures, and the large clusters come apart.

It allows customers to make an informed decision.  It prevents dissatisfaction and PR disasters.<p>I also think this should be a lesson for younger businessmen.

I have a background in electronic engineering and I have taught myself a good deal about computers.<p>I love to build things, and want to do great work. There are some big challenges that I will be trying to solve. I also get lots of ideas for instrumentation, processes in my work. These are enough to take almost all of my mental space and I try to work on these 12-13 hours each day, everyday. I love working and find it very satisfying (even though failure rate of my experiments is about 75 % or more).<p>I want help in deciding whether I should marry. I am worried if I will be able to give enough time to either my s.o. or to work. My work doesn't put too many demands on how I live (apart from some discipline and healthy living), while marriage does. Marriage will also restrict my choices in career and movement. With kids, my responsibilities outside work will increase further.<p>On the other side, marriage is supposed to bring some fulfillment (companion, kids). I do have a need for company, but it is not too strong, and I have now become habituated of my condition. I am writing this as a 30 yr old person who doesn't have a partner, is an immigrant and can have a partner if he desires so. It may also be good for old age. Choosing not to marry will also invoke very strong response from my family and relationships.<p>If I suffer due to not marrying I can blame myself and others will not face many consequences. With marriage, 2-3 lives will be related strongly to mine, and that is more than I am willing to risk.<p>I would like to have your viewpoints on this.",1285428680
