I've had to train myself at every job, that's part of what I do. I can't imagine how training would work. Classes in some programming language perhaps? It's much faster for me just to pick up the syntax of a language over the weekend and then fill in the blanks on toy projects or while doing maintenance.",1284868770

I log into a remote workstation in a secure environment that houses my main repositories, where I'll check out a project, develop it, and publish the code to a remote server. Since most of my transfers use rsync over ssh, or mercurial via ssh, agent forwarding comes in really handy. It's convenient, fast, and my private keys are protected adequately with passphrases, so I don't need to worry if my laptop gets stolen, since it doesn't have anything valuable on it.",1284868696

I viewed it in w3m, now suspecting Javascript oddness was at fault, and was presented with a list of keystrokes (helpfully hidden by the Javascript that runs when you hit the page).  In fact, it doesn't even load the slides (which are all formatted text--HTML!  The thing browsers are for viewing!) until the Javascript runs.<p>From a quick glance at the source, it appears the culprit is some atrocity called ""showoff"", apparently.

The license to distribute the compiled kernel is contingent upon anything derived from it being GPL as well (section 2b/3). Might be able to hack around this with a different entity doing the signing, but hopefully a court would see through that sham.<p>2. But modifications to the executable program itself (in flash) have to be facilitated. The preferred (HTC engineering) way of making these modifications is through the bootloader. There might be a loophole here in that the bootloader could be changed to allow flashing any kernel (but still not execute without a key), but being sold the device while it was on (with derivative works all over the place in RAM) would negate said loophole.<p>3. The specific script that has to be included is the one which generated and installed the resulting executable which was distributed to me on my specific device.<p>4.

1705525,comment,1705221,1705404,0,0,antileet,,,"""What's wrong with having one founder? To start with, it's a vote of no confidence. It probably means the founder couldn't talk any of his friends into starting the company with him. That's pretty alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.""<p>Well, Taking all my close friends, who might be comfortable working with me - and filtering out those who are from a CS/Programming background, exhibit genuine hacker mentality, can delay gratification sufficiently by not immediately jumping into a well-paying job, and can work in a similar pace as mine - I'm left with a pretty small set. And that set didn't graduate with me, so the argument that the very fact that I don't have anyone starting a company with me does not sufficiently imply that my idea is poor or that my convincing skills are sub-par might not be perfectly valid.<p>I agree with most of the things that PG writes about, (who doesn't?), but I find something wrong on a fundamental level with the justification of why single founders are a bad idea.<p>From a single founder, I fear there are other reasons why a startup might potentially fail with a single founder:<p>* One might get too easily tempted to quit, and won't get easily talked out of it.\n* There's nobody to push you to work when you're feeling lazy. This can lead to a lot of time being wasted.\n* Ideas need to be bounced back and forth. They must be criticized again and again until no criticism can be made about them. There's nobody to do it with here.\n* If you have co-founders you always have company if you want to get some coffee, or play something outdoors :)<p>I'm hoping that once I launch and am able to demonstrate my abilities and ideas (or the lack of them), I might be able to find people who are willing to work. I look forward to saying ""Hey, do you want to help me improve this great product which is doing quite well"" instead of ""Hey, do you want to drop everything in your life and hack on my neat idea"".",1284866969

If the place is dead, they'd probably be grateful for you to sit there and make it look more happening for someone who comes in. But during busy time, clogging up table space for three hours on one coffee is probably aggravating.<p>When I go to a non-chain, if I want to sit for longer than is normal, I just ask them. ""I was thinking of having a coffee and hanging out on my laptop for a few hours - is that okay with you?"" 90% of shops will say yes if they're not busy, or tell you when the time that that they get busy is. 10% will give a hesitant yes or non-answer, and I'll either only stay a short time or head out from there.
