They should be forced into financial prudence.""</i><p>If you're going to make this claim, you have to defend it with facts.  Right now, you're just making a very wordy assertion, based on an extremely loose understanding of the situation, and a big helping of ideology.<p>Here's a history of Washington state spending since 1999:<p><a href=""http://fiscal.wa.gov/FRViewer.aspx?Rpt=Recast%20History%20Expenditure%20Statewide%20Summary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fiscal.wa.gov/FRViewer.aspx?Rpt=Recast%20History%20Ex...</a><p>Since you seem very sure of yourself, perhaps you'd like to tell the rest of us which lines are ""irresponsible"".  Be sure to defend your choices.<p>(As a former resident of Washington, my opinion is that one of the huge problems in state has been the abuse of the initiative process to both lock up tax revenue for particular uses (just like California), and also to knock out important sources of revenue (like property taxes and the vehicle registration tax).  In a state that <i>already</i> has no income tax, it becomes extremely difficult to satisfy even reasonable growth in spending when other important sources of revenue are eliminated or capped at arbitrary levels.)",1285030775

</code></pre>
""Far fetched"" is a good way to put it. It's completely unsourced and suspect even to a casual look. I won't nitpick each entry, but a couple stood out to me.<p>The Yak-4 was a contemporary of the British de Havilland Mosquito. The bomber variant of the British aircraft entirely outclasses the Russian airplane.<p>As for the M-4 Molot, of which it's claimed ""Though there were truly only 18 aircraft in prototype stage, the hoax of circling the same 18 planes fooled the unsuspecting US,"" I think it wasn't a good plan to parade the small force as if it were much larger, prompting the deployment of the B-52 fleet, which really could deliver an intercontinental strike, and practiced it daily.<p>Finally, I'm going to pick on the Tu-160. I won't go into the details (long and boring), but reading this bit about a long patrol, <a href=""http://mn.ru/russia/20100610/187867766.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mn.ru/russia/20100610/187867766.html</a>, realize that Western aircraft have been doing this continually for decades, while the Soviets (and now Russians) lost the skill to disuse. It's pretty disingenuous to claim that the Soviets were far ahead.<p>Of course, it's linkbait, what with the frequent flyer rewards push at the bottom, but it's frustratingly at odds with reality. I prefer my linkbait to be bland puff pieces.",1285030517
