1718626,comment,1718367,1718367,0,0,jlgbecom,,,"There are a lot of lessons to be learned from Diaspora, beyond the (brilliant) points made about security.<p>1. When media hype provides you with $200k, you're still best served by bringing people's expectations down to earth.  There was no way they were going to be able to build anything approaching a Facebook killer in 3 months, and it would have been best if they would have made that clear in the beginning.<p>2. There are a number of projects like Diaspora that have been working for years towards the same exact goal.  The only way Diaspora could have succeeded where those have failed (or not-yet-succeeded), is if they had properly articulated where they would go right where others had gone wrong.  If you can't do that, you probably don't have the perspective necessary to take on such a huge project.<p>3. We all need to be less susceptible to the story of the ""boy wonders"" taking on the establishment.  Between Diaspora and Haystack+, these should be sobering lessons about the dangers of hype and a good human-interest story when the result we need is stable, well-written code.<p>+ <a href=""http://blog.jgc.org/2010/09/myth-of-boy-wizard.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.jgc.org/2010/09/myth-of-boy-wizard.html</a><p>4. Open source isn't magic.  Rails isn't magic.  Having a good idea and a whole lot of heart isn't magic.  It's true that the software world isn't exactly a meritocracy, but at the same time, we need to recognize that you have to be able to build something generally usable, and if you can't, there's nothing that will save you except for harder work and learned lessons.  Some bugs will be fixed by the interest in Diaspora, but there are big architecture questions here that need to be resolved, and coordinating that democratically through the internet in a sea of strangers is a logistical nightmare.  And while rails does provide a lot of functionality out-of-the-box, a project of this size isn't held up by how long it takes to write the photo-uploading code, it's held up by the big-picture stuff that rails can't really help you with.  In the end, programming is programming.  You need specs, mockups, user stories, documentation, all kinds of unsexy stuff.<p>I think we'll probably see Diaspora stabilize into something usable at some point.  But I'm very doubtful that will be anytime soon, and I'm especially doubtful that it will be before the other projects (Elgg, Appleseed, OneSocialWeb, StatusNet, etc) mature into the facebook killer people want to see.<p>Building the kind of open source social networking software necessary to take on Facebook at it's own game is such a massive, complex undertaking, and it's such undiscovered territory, that there really is a big disadvantage to being the new kid on the block.",1285217839

I would rather sell stock to somebody understanding in that way than to deal with a multitude of people who I don't know telling me what I am doing right or wrong.<p>The first time I raised money I made the mistake of not knowing two of the investors well enough, but I took their money anyway and they ended up being complete assholes. I will never live that decision down, because of how much damage and wasted time it caused (much more than what they themselves invested).<p>I have no experience with Kickstarter, but you could see some examples of that with Diaspora - people putting pressure on the company to go one way or another because 'hey, we funded this thing! listen to us!'. It sounds like potentially having hundreds of asshole investors (I know they don't get stock, but that doesn't effect some persons right to think and behave like they do).<p>YC is also a shortcut into the SV network, which can be very important depending on your plans for the company.

1718605,comment,1716829,1718177,0,0,sophacles,,,"I was using the term acceleration in it's physics sense ""a change in the velocity vector"" which means both speed and direction. Crazy meant multiple rapid changes in direction and speed, like say, falling off a bike would result in this ""crazy acceleration"" as would being hit by something.<p>Also, sometimes the reaction/result of aggressive drivers isn't catastrophic. For instance, today on my way home from work I had 2 different drivers decide to come within a foot of my bike while passing. This is a calculated move, intended to scare me and teach me a lesson. I know because in one case, I asked when we both got to the same red light, and in the other, the rude gestures of the driver.  An accelerometer would have shown nothing, as any reaction on my part would probably have been worse than just hoping the driver didn't judge wrong.<p>It's not just ""tight driving"" either, other times drivers are rude, make threatening actions with their vehicles or just plain block my motion preventing me from changing lanes, making turns, and so on, which should be captured, but don't cause anything particularly noticeable in accelerometer data.<p>Alternately, the false positive rate is probably pretty high here too. I have at least 2 places on my daily commute where I short-cut thru alleys and make some pretty jarring curb passages.  There is one particularly tricky transition from street to bike path involving 3 turns in a very short distance (30ish feet). On fast days I bet it looks more like reacting to an aggressive driver than most aggressive driver reactions (from an accelerometer point of view).",1285216995

Your first day's goals are torches and shelter.  Make a pick, explore until you find a cliff face with coal (it looks like stone with big chocolate chips), use the coal to make torches.  Then, when it gets close to dark, dig yourself a hole to hide in from zombies and skeletons.  Light it up with torches and seal off all but a one-square window.

But with some of the FB valuations, we're talking 30x or 50x valuations -- which are not just hype, these are cocaine and ecstasy fueled hooker party numbers.<p>Even if, given their current revenue model, they <i>tripled</i> revenue tomorrow. They're still only a marginal investment with either a 10 to a 50 year payout depending. Those are U.S. federal securities time periods. If I had $40 billion I had to dump for 10 years, I'd put it into bonds before I'd put it into FB.<p>As I was attempting to point out, no matter the hype, once you saturate the market, you can't hype away the math. Right now at the lower end valuations, they are a 30 year investment. I don't think <i>anybody</i> in their right mind would take on those odds considering the population growth curve of the human species.<p>FB is going to have to adopt a seriously different revenue model in order to try and keep their revenue growth curve up and bring down these insane valuation multiples on their revenue -- they simply can't keep relying on new signups and ads. I have a feeling anything they do will be intrusive and along lines that won't be what people like (first 10 friends are free! $5/friend after that!).",1285215878
