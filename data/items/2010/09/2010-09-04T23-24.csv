1663691,comment,1663474,1663665,0,0,kenjackson,,,"Well its not so much that learning to learn is more difficult, but learning to learn in a given domain.  If you don't have someone to teach you, figuring out the ideal way to learn something can be tricky.<p>For example, the Rubiks Cube.  I'm sure there are great ways to learn to solve this puzzle, but I learned using a very time consuming technique with a lot of failure.  While I have a really good schema for book learning, I have a relatively poor schema for learning the optimal way to manipulate items in 3space, despite the fact that I live that space.",1283644736

That way they don't have to deal with the fact that you're not a US Citizen for payroll purposes, as they just pay you like any other vendor.<p>You can work remotely / travel to the US for periods of a few weeks at a time, working out of their offices - sublet apartments from craigslist for a month or two at a time, then return back to Canada. I believe there is a US visa you need to get to do this, under the guise you are working for a foreign business conducting biz in the US.<p>If the startup takes off, you will be integral enough to the process that they will (hopefully) hire an immigration lawyer to figure out how to get you into the country for longer periods of time and pay you directly. If it doesn't take off, probably best that they didn't issue your VISA after all...<p>I know of a few people who got in from eastern europe to the US that way... again, I am not a lawyer though, and therefore don't know if what these guys did was legal or not, just repeating what I heard...",1283644339

I started blogging earlier this year, and only at that point did I realize how difficult it is. So, taking my first point into account – my suggestion is that you <i>do</i> write every day, but not necessarily share everything you write. A journal is good for this, or even write it on your computer without publishing it. Whatever works. By doing so, I think you still develop your voice and style, without obligating yourself to add to your blog every day. This approach has helped me avoid burnout.

It seemed to be accusing Thiel of not considering the big picture, when in fact Thiel is considering something much, much larger.  You're asking about differential pricing of prescription drugs, while he's wondering about the impact of a spot market on human organs.  What did you think of that part?<p>Thiel isn't arguing that globalization is a done deal.  If anything, he agrees that what we have is astonishingly incomplete: ""we stand at a level of globalization that compares with the previous peak year of 1913"".  Rather, he's asking whether the economic world as we know it could withstand true globalization.<p>But to answer your question:  yes, I think it's only to be expected that corporations will seek to maximize their profits through price discrimination.  And also to be expected that true globalization will make this more difficult to do.    But while it's clear that those paying the higher price would benefit in the short-term from paying a lower price, it's not clear to me who would benefit in the long-term from forcing companies to choose a single set price somewhere in the middle.  It probably depends on how this would be enforced.",1283642037

Of course I understand that you do not allow the govt. to pass laws restricting speech, and of course you allow and even celebrate hateful speech. And yes, you dearly cherish the quaint notion of an armed rebellion: That's how you were founded.<p>But nothing you have said explains why your laws celebrate freedom for the first two cases: You trust citizens with the right to speak and the right to manage their own deadly weapons, but in the third case you are suddenly ""You can't be trusted to make your own choices.""<p>Thus, I find your answer is a non-answer, because it does not explain the dichotomy. Furthermore, your third point confuses me. Are you saying that it is an American value to avoid sex before or outside of a marriage conducted for the purpose of raising children?",1283642028

(1) It's graded on a simple ""percentage right"" basis, so 24/40 questions necessary right to pass, (2) 4 options for each question<p>Her score on an individual test is a random variable X following a binomial distribution with 40 trials and chance of 0.25 for each trial. Her chance of passing by guessing randomly, P(X >= 24), is an infinitesimally small 2.826E-6.<p>The probability that she fails all of the 960 tests, assuming independence of tests, is (1-p)^960. So the probability that she will pass at least one test is:<p><pre><code>  1 - (1 - p)^960
</code></pre>
Plugging in p = 2.826E-6, the chance is still practically 0, so a naive guessing strategy would not work.<p>However, under the above assumptions, she could practically guarantee her success by combining this guessing strategy with a simple test-taking strategy like eliminating 1 or 2 obviously wrong answers per question, or just remembering the answers to several of the same questions that are probably being recycled from test to test.",1283641378
