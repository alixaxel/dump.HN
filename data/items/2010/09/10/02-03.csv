1677736,comment,1677013,1677013,0,0,lsc,,,"what, do people think about the ethics of a manager using the  'intermittent rewards' part in the form of unpredictable bonuses over and above regular salary (which would be regular)  with the intent of harnessing the addictive nature of intermittent rewards, without using the rest of these things (which clearly cross the line into unethical.)<p>I'm considering implementing a bonus plan... and the question is, do I make them predictable, based on measurable stuff that I share?  or do I add some randomness?  do I assign them based on my own shifting perceptions?  (the sort of people I hire are going to be better at manipulating the set rules than manipulating my perceptions... This is not true for all employees.)<p>Furthermore, would it still work if I used a predictable bonus schedule that included some random input... e.g. the chance of getting the bonus is, say, some metric based on increases in revenue or profit multiplied by a random value between 0 an 1 or something?",1284087554

1677734,comment,1677477,1677715,0,0,kylec,,,"While that might make sense for some companies, it would be a bit backwards for Google. Android is used as a means of getting users to use their services (Google Voice, Google Maps, etc). As such, restricting app use to attract users to Android would be like restricting google.com to only run on Chrome to promote their browser.<p>My fear, though, is that Google consideres web apps better than 'regular' apps - this is apparent in their decision to integrate VOIP into GMail instead of releasing their Google Voice app that had been in use internally for some time:<p><a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/01/exclusive-video-of-unreleased-google-voice-desktop-app/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/01/exclusive-video-of-unreleas...</a><p>This is unfortunate because, although web apps will do in a pinch, they really are second-class citizens on the mobile platform, unable to run as fast or have access to the system APIs that native apps get, and if Google Voice truly wants to replace my dialer I need it to work even when my data connection craps out.",1284087527

1677722,comment,1676242,1677638,0,0,jerf,,,"You don't really need to hypothesize. It isn't a conspiracy theory that schools were designed to produce good factory workers, it is documented historical fact. (Where by ""documented historical fact"" I mean as factual as any ""historical"" fact ever is.) See something like <a href=""http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johntaylorgatto.com/chapters/index.htm</a> . You do not have to agree with Gatto's prescription for what schools should become or agree with his reaction to the fact that schools were designed to produce good factory workers to agree that the proposition is very well grounded in fact, when it comes complete with quotes about the intention from the people who were creating our schools in the first place.<p>For myself, I do not believe that people still truly intend it this way; I do not believe there is a mass conscious effort to prevent critical thinking skills from being developed or to deliberately hold people back from realizing their true potential. If you find your brain rebelling against the entire idea that schools could have been created for this purpose, remember this was over a hundred years ago, and I for one don't claim this is <i>still</i> the animus behind schools. In fact I suggest that the vast bulk of people's actions demonstrate a true desire to arm children with the best education they can be given, it's just that the average person, even the average person deeply involved with education, is clueless about how to actually bring that result about in the real world. Meanwhile, the pattern of ""what a school looks like"" was laid down when this <i>was</i> a conscious intention and through literally 5 or 6 generations now has accidentally been enshrined as Gospel, and few people are yet thinking outside the box; those that do are laughed at at best, vilified at worst. Fortunately, the Internet will, eventually, change this, though probably not until the <i>current</i> teen generation, the one that has never known the world without it, is the majority on the PTA.",1284087253

For what it's worth my first user reaction was:<p>* Looking good!<p>* Of course I jumped in without reading any help and didn't realize the full power of the natural language search, in particular ""direct"" would have been handy to know. I'm sure you recognize this as a potential problem.. That said, my perception is it's not that big a deal from your perspective - it didn't stop me using the site and having done 1 booking now and liked the experience I've bothered to investigate further (including reading the very easy to find help), and now feel much more qualified to drive.<p>* The flights cost more than indicated because they didn't include luggage. Be nice to see an all inclusive number, especially as I can't help speculating the price quoting is probably not uniform across airlines... some prices being more inclusive than others. Also, I guess it made the real price of the multi-segment route I selected closer to what a direct flight would have been, making me more likely to have wanted a direct flight.<p>* Would have liked to exclude a specific airline, can I do that?

When I got stuck and asked for help, instead of taking over, my supervisor gave me some resources to look at, or people to talk to, and told me that he wanted my perspective on how to solve the problem.<p>3) My supervisor had me give a number of presentations on my work (3), which both gave me confidence that what I was doing was important, and gave me valuable feedback on how my project could be improved. Two of these presentations were internal, and one was to customers.<p>4) While my day to day tasks didn't involve working with the other interns that were there that summer (this was a good thing for me, I preferred working with experienced employees), there was a program set up that had the interns create an event for the other employees to attend. So, I got to make friends, and get to know some people outside my department.<p>These things came together to make a great internship. I think you're on the right track, though, because the most important thing that made my internship a success was my autonomy and the feeling that my work mattered.",1284086933
