1677835,comment,1677334,1677334,0,0,marvin,,,"My first thought is that this video looks exactly like a video game, but that is because current video doesn't use these techniques whereas video games do. I think this actually looks better than traditional video, but whether it is actually adopted or not depends on what viewers think. There's an interesting parallel with the fact that TV broadcasts and digitally filmed movies aren't displayed in higher framerats: They look ""fake"" or ""homemade"".<p>What we really need to make our digital images more lifelike, of course, is cameras and monitors with higher dynamic range. There are efforts underway to creating actual HDR LCD monitors where there instead of a backlight there is an array of white LEDs that are selectively lit according to which parts of the monitor we want to be bright, resulting in a ridiculously high contrest ratio. But for the time being, data formats are designed for our current contrast ratio or dynamic range.<p>Don't remember who said this, but a researcher in this field said something along the lines of ""you would never mistake your monitor for a window to the outside, but this is what we are trying to achieve"". This actually seems plausible, apart from the depth perception side of things, with today's developments in super-high resolution displays. Think the new iPhone display scaled up to 50 inches, with a much higher contrast ratio. I'm very excited about this.<p>It's going to be interesting to see what amateurs do with the D5 camera. Equipment costs are no longer an excuse not to do cool things with video, and this demonstration is a perfect example.",1284091143

1677806,comment,1675483,1676824,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"All of this thread about whether or not social games are fun is such an oversimplification as to be worthless.<p>First off, there's the semantics. What is a social game? Is it something running in Facebook? If so, you're not going to see it evolve too much too soon. That's because of the way the platform incentives are structured, the mindset of the average person who is on Facebook at the moment (more often than not at work, multitasking, able to devote only infrequent, short bursts of attention) and the inherent technical limitations of the Flash platform. If you ever saw the traffic graphs of a successful game, you'd understand immediately why casual is winning. It has a high bounce rate and peaks on weekday mornings.<p>If you define ""social gaming"" more broadly, which I think you should, then World of Warcraft, League of Legends, and many other very innovative games are social games. In that case you're already seeing social games evolve. My little cousins play Call of Duty over Xbox live with each other from their homes 50 miles apart every day. That's social gaming if you ask me, and they at least think it's fun.<p>There's certainly no accounting for taste. It's just plain snobbish to say the games you like are ""universally recognized as fun"" and the games you don't like aren't. I'd rather jam a ballpoint pen into my eye than play an asynchronous game of Scrabble. You'd sooner catch me playing Farmville.",1284090027

1677744,comment,1677679,1677679,0,0,lzw,,,"For government spending to create a job that pays around $60,000 a year, it costs about $100,000.  Figuring $40,000 in overhead.  These are estimates, but even if you change the figures, the math below will still work.<p>A business decides to hire an employee or not based on the businesses marginal productivity.   Employees, for most businesses, are profitable as the business value of their labor exceeds the costs of their salary and overhead.<p>However, businesses must factor in risk as a cost, and in many instances, employees or expansions such as new stores or factories are not immediately profitable to businesses.  Thus a business that is profitable per employee cannot simply double its workforce and thus double its income by hiring a bunch of new people.  This ""drag"" on growth in employees is the marginal cost, or could be called the profits cost.<p>It will vary by industry, but it seems that a %10 factor for the marginal cost seems like a reasonable estimate.  EG: for each $100,000 in operational profits we will hire another employee (With the rest going to capital investment, paying down loans, dividends to shareholders, etc.)<p>Thus, for the Obama administration to spend $100,000 to create one $60,000 a year job, they must take $100,000 out of the economy... and in the process remove that $10,000 from ten businesses, destroying 10 $60,000 jobs in the process.<p>This is why stimulus is never beneficial to the economy.<p>Fortunately, businesses are still generally profitable and the economy naturally wants to grow, so it will eventually recover from this damage.  And when it does, people will give credit to the ""stimulus"" though by looking at the cost as well as the benefits, it is easy to see that it does more harm than good.<p>I used example figures here that will vary by industry, but you cant' deny that most employees are profitable, that businesses decide based on marginal value and growth factors, and thus the ""cost"" of a new employee is a fraction of their salary, and thus the creation of one job by the government will destroy a multiple of jobs in the private sector.  The ratio may be 10-1 or it may be 5-1, but it is not ""profitable"" to the economy.<p>If it were, greece would be a roaring success story, because their government has done nothing but spend, spend spend.",1284087696
