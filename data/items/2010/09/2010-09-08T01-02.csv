If I'm pressed for time, it's closer to an hour.<p>Also, I don't know that I always work 9 hours a day. Realistically, I probably work a normal 8. I also often eat lunch at my desk, which shaves off half an hour from your estimated eating time.<p>As for chores: I pay someone to clean my apartment. I'd rather spend the time on other things.<p>I don't watch much TV. I also don't spend a lot of time hanging out with friends during the week.

I mean 90 minutes for the entire gym-going process, not like 90 minutes of flat-out cardio or heavy-duty lifting. That would indeed be ridiculous for someone who isn't a professional athlete. Like I said, that routine works for me; it's what I need to feel like I got a good workout. But I also want to try other techniques. Part of the appeal of CrossFit is that you get a ""better"" workout in a shorter period of time.<p>You can find sources that say dropping carbs is bad idea, and you can find sources that say dropping carbs is a great idea. Again: it's what works for me. I'll still eat some whole grains and other ""good"" carbs.<p>If you noticed, the bit about the German/English heritage ended in a joke, suggesting that I was exaggerating a bit there. But since you bring it up: yes, I've seen plenty of portly English and German folks, and also some quite fit ones.

My understanding of academic linguistics is that there are two main schools of thought: on one side you have Noam Chomsky as the most famous exponent, saying that all languages have a sort of universal grammar that somehow reflects our brain structure, and on the other the behaviorism of BF Skinner, that languages are largely arbitrary, syntactic processing is learned behavior, and complexity is both a result of and a selector for intelligence as an evolutionary trait.<p>I don't have a really strong opinion, though I lean a bit towards the behaviorist approach.

It's the ultimate definition of unfair.<p>Umm, have you ever noticed how people are actually taxed?  It's called a ""marginal"" tax rate and it's a feature of just about every tax system in the world, precisely because it is considered a ""fairer"" system to have people who can afford to pay more share more of the tax burden.<p>One might even argue that the ""super profits"" tax is fairer than marginal tax rates because it takes account of the amount of capital you have deployed to achieve the result (to relate it back to people, if I have a family of 10 people to support I don't get a lower tax rate ... but a company with 10,000 people to achieve the same profit as one with 1000 people will get that taken into account).",1283910495

I've heard that the company I work for released them to executives a few weeks ago, and it sounds like we're not alone. What's really exciting though is how the enterprise desktop space is on the edge of some big changes.<p>In the past, workers sat in one location and worked in a predictable pattern for a set amount of time. Workers weren't very comfortable with technology and needed major support. Moreover, work was pretty task-oriented -- it could be modeled with workflow very easily.<p>The environment of today is quite a contrast. The location and work hours of users are definitely not predictable. Furthermore, assistance and limited options from the IT department can get in the user's way sometimes. Also, knowledge workers spend a lot of time doing unstructured work -- analysis, brainstorming, design -- which is something that is hard to model.<p>Clearly, the old model for desktop has to change. I don't think we can throw a few departmental applications with a heap of productivity applications at people and call it a job well done. The iPad's introduction into the enterprise is a start that signifies different kinds of devices can be helpful. Desktop virtualization and the cloud probably have a role to play in all this too.

The blanket is two-dimensional and embedded in the three dimensions of our world, hence it has boundaries. Space is, well, space. It's not embedded in anything. This is quite nonintuitive and here's where the blanket analogy hurts more than it helps.<p>The best way I know how to think about curved spacetime is by analogy to the Earth. We are effectively two-dimensional on the Earth's surface, as the radius of curvature is much larger than we are. Yet you can imagine drawing straight lines (i.e., great circles) on the ground to make (large) triangles and discovering that the angles don't add to 180 degrees and hence deduce that the surface is curved.<p>It's sort of the same way with space. Since we are three-dimensional, we can't directly perceive the curvature as we can an embedded two-dimensional object. A straight line would always look straight to us, yet we could <i>measure</i> the curvature by observing that the fundamental theorems of Euclidean geometry don't hold.<p>The Earth <i>does</i> slowly spiral towards the Sun. There's no ""friction"" per se, but it loses angular momentum to other stuff, like gravitational waves and the dark matter hslo. It just operates <i>extremely</i> slowly.",1283908675

I guess it's a matter of perspective. Still, I would imagine it is easier to experiment with presenting, gender identity, etc when you are anonymous behind a LiveJournal (for some reason all the trans people I know have one). Heck, I was accidentally presenting as male for 2+ years on usenet because nobody took the time to wonder what gender I was, instead just assuming.",1283908522

But moreover, as the end of the rod speeds up, it will experience relativistic mass increase from your point of view, so it would still take an infinite amount of energy to accelerate it to <i>c</i>, regardless of how long your lever was. (Though special relativity, dealing with inertial frames, is strictly not applicable to a rotating rod, but you can probably make use of a succession of infinitesimal inertial frames to figure that out.)",1283908285

I wanted to ask however, when they explain gravity by the analogy of holding a blanket, first the blanket is on earth thus any object that is put on it is being pulled down by earth and the blanket is being held by two people, thus what is pulling the earth and sun down and who is holding the space blanket? Also, seeing some of the images on the site, it is clear that space is something and it is not nothing. Thus, what is space?<p>The second thing is that if you carry out the above experiment, the ball would eventually stop. That is because of friction. Why does the earth never stop? What makes it overcome friction?<p>Someone is probably going to shoot me down for being a complete idiot and knowing nothing, but I am genuinely interested to know the answer or to know if there is no answer.",1283908241
