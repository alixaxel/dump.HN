FWIW, I was brought back to do a bit of work later, and the number 3 guy in the place heard my story and was basically shocked that HR had handled things this way.<p>How this happened was I'd handed in my notice already - 2 weeks.  But... I wanted to know if I was going to get my remaining vacation time as pay or not.  I'd started before there was an 'hr handbook', but there was one in place.  I wrote to HR and asked, and was told ""it's in the handbook"".  I wrote back and asked what page it was on, because I couldn't see it in mine.<p>I got an email back saying something to the effect of ""here's your vacation that's owed you..."" and that was it.  10 minutes later the guy in the same cube as me said email to me bounced.  I watched him send and it bounced back saying 'mailbox invalid'.  An HR rep from our building came to my desk another 10 minutes later with a box saying ""I have to escort you out of the building now"".  She was nice about it, and didn't seem to <i>want</i> to do it, but did it.  So... the project I was working on was left in a broken state, client emails to me bounced, and they had no clue what was going on.  I left, set up my own shop, and <i>what do you know</i> - that client decided to jump ship and stay with me instead of being charged twice the hourly rate for the kind of service they were getting.  Basically, they considered their business too important to be cut off by phone and email from the people doing the work solely on the whim of one HR person.<p>Yeah, that was my rant.  Again, only happened to me once, but it happened, and I've seen it happen to others.",1283799162

1667174,comment,1666780,1666780,0,0,phaedrus,,,"Coincidently I'm reading Ernst Mach's ""The Science of Mechanics"" at this very moment.  It includes a lot of analysis of setups like this.<p>As for this problem:  consider first the weights.  Each one's downward force is 1 kg, due to gravity.  There must also be exactly 1 kg's force's worth of tension in the string, because if it were less the weights would be moving down and if it were more the weights would be pulled up.  Because the system (is assumed to be) not moving, we may replace the right side weight and pulley wheel with a fixed anchor for the string, in which case there would be no doubt that the spring balance displays 1 kg.  Argument from symmetry says the scale would also read 1 kg if the left side were anchored and the right side free.  Because the system in unmoving, it really makes no difference whether the opposite side of the scale is fixed to an anchor or balanced by a free weight:  it will read 1 kg in all cases.<p>This is very similar to a Car Talk puzzler that their physicist consultant clarified:  is it worse to be in a car going 60 mph that hits an unmovable highway overpass wall, or to be in a car going 60 mph that hits an identical car perfectly head-on that is also going 60 mph?  The physicist's answer was that there is no difference:  in both cases you experience an identical impulse going from 60 mph to a stop in the same time.<p>You may be inclined disbelieve this on the idea that the crumple zones in the car-to-car collision make for a ""softer"" collision, but consider this:  define the point at which the bumpers of the two cars as ""the origin"".  Assuming the cars and the collision are perfectly symmetrical, each car is going to crumple up on its respective side of the origin identically.  Suppose the force starts small and ramps up gradually as the crumpling occurs; each car will be pushing the other away with the same force.  An unmoving highway overpass barrier would resist with the same force.",1283799054

1667163,comment,1660360,1666484,0,0,perigrin,,,"The question is should the documentation shipped with perl document the features available with that distribution, or should it document the features available in the wider Perl culture?<p>For example, Moose has always made an effort to cooperate with the native Perl object system. The documentation in the perldoc's for object oriented programming isn't wrong. The skills you learn from perltoot and companions will transfer to Moose, you'll know how the underlying implementation works. Is this the right way to learn Perl's Object Oriented programming? That is an argument the Perl community itself is having[1]. As that argument is resolved the documentation is updated.<p>If you think about this in startup terms. Moose as a project is 4 years old. Would you invest in a startup that had an exit strategy that was targeted for than than 5 years? Moose has just recently (in the last year or two) reached a dominant market position when compared to the existing competition (Class::MethodMaker, Class::STD, etc) but still is adopted by only 5% of the total market (that is we have ~1K direct downstream dependencies out of about 20K distribution on CPAN). It would be premature to expect the industry to recognize let alone promote Moose as the de-facto standard. However it would be an excellent bet that sometime in the next few years that will happen.<p>Of the ""Modern Perl"" distributions out there Moose is one of the most consolidated in it's scope. Things like Catalyst have been gaining new competition (Dancer, Mojolicious) in their respective markets. It's interesting to watch things that appear to my untrained eye like market forces play out across the adoption of various CPAN modules.<p>To circle back around, perl documentation needs to strike a careful balance between what they can guarantee exists (bless $ref, __PACKAGE__) and what the community accepts as best practice (use Moose;). The documentation needs to intentionally be less dynamic than the fashions of the community. It must be conservative enough to provide continuity so that someone who happens to be on a perl-5.8.8 box (released 3 months before Moose, and still the standard on RHEL if I recall) doesn't learn a whole different set of ""best practice"" modules than someone on a 5.10.1 box. It does however need to be updated as things like Moose take over the mind share and prove themselves out. When only 1 in 20 modules you run into will likely involve Moose, you'll still need to understand the native solutions. When that ratio changes, the balance will need to change too.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/980751/should-i-learn-perl-5-oo-or-moose-first/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/980751/should-i-learn-per...</a>",1283798712

1667159,comment,1666780,1667092,0,0,jazzychad,,,"> you're saying is that the spring can't distinguish between the setup on the right and the setup on the left.<p>Correct, because according to the balance, both setups are indistinguishable.<p>The dark secret of spring balances is that they measure (and display) force <i>in only one direction</i>. In stasis, the net forces on the balance are exactly zero N since there are equal and opposite forces acting upon the balance (true in each setup), yet the needle moves because it is measuring the movement (stretching) of the spring inside the balance (which at one end is anchored internally to the balance casing, and the other end is anchored to the string/mass).<p>So, as for the setup on the right, the left-hand weight is pulling on the balance with weight 1kg (9.8N), and the right-hand weight is pulling on the balance with weight 1kg (9.8N), but since the balance only displays forces in one direction, it will display 1kg (in this case it doesn't matter which direction it is measuring because the forces are 180 degrees from each other).",1283798573

If given a description of a physical situation, begin by using your understanding of the force types to identify which forces are present. Then determine the direction in which each force is acting. Finally, draw a box and add arrows for each existing force in the appropriate direction; label each force arrow according to its type.

This let it able to do the designed behavior, which was calculate very small delta(time) to be able to do velocity/position calculations and get fairly close to fast moving objects then go <i>boom</i>.<p>The problem is that floating point numbers have a limited amount of precision available to them, and if you are using a few billion milliseconds (2 weeks), almost all of your precision is lost to the left of the decimal point (and, given that this is precision-intensive work, you didn't need to wait that long to see anomalies).<p>Lower precision meant that taking delta(time) got increasingly less precise as time went on.
