1667570,comment,1666519,1666519,0,0,rmc00,,,"This is an interesting service to consider from the perspective of both the sender and recipient of an email message.<p>The value that you create for the recipient is the spam filtering that you mention only as an aside. If someone is paying to send an email message, it's very unlikely that the message is spam. This form of micropayment makes email cost a little bit to senders, but it makes spam lose its cost-effectiveness. As a recipient, you can pretty much guarantee that email coming from this service is not spam. That makes going through your inbox a lot simpler.<p>On the other hand, value is created for the sender of email too. Because the recipient of the email is (mostly) assured that the message isn't spam, a response is much more likely. It sounds like you have a means (or idea) to guarantee a response too, which obviously amplifies this effect.<p>I think the service has potential. The first question that comes to my mind is who do you charge? You definitely charge the sender, but do you charge the recipient as well? Also, how do you make this work in a user's existing inbox? It seems like having users check another inbox will decrease the effectiveness of the service.<p>It's interesting that your solution is sort of an incremental solution to spam. To me, the best solution to spam would be to add authentication to SMTP or a new protocol with widespread adoption. However, your solution is more realistic.",1283813429

There's no way of knowing what the future holds, best to bank as much now while the price is good.  Yes, it holds some risk over the geopolitical situation, but you can't get rid of that.<p>Digging up minerals and selling them now puts Australia to work. drives down the Current Account deficit, allows us all to enjoy a higher standard of living.  Put simply, Australia has comparative advantage in minerals mining so we should maximise this to the benefit of all.  Unemployment is 5% because of the mining, not despite the mining.<p>It's not an either/or question on mining/information technology.  There's plenty of room for both.  Australia can lead the world in minerals, and mineral extraction technology.  Australia has already built up world class mining companies that now invest internationally.  Long may that continue - with a stable political climate, well developed capital markets and a home-grown skills and technology base, there's no reason why Australian miners can't be major players in worldwide resource extraction for centuries to come, even if the iron ore in the Pilbara runs out. The world will never stop mining - never has, never will.",1283813247

1667555,comment,1547900,1549332,0,0,pascal_cuoq,,,"> You have now, this is what I do for a living.<p>Perhaps there is a misunderstanding. I was speaking of security researchers who look for flaws without having been prompted to do so (the ""money"" in ""fame, money and ego"" was the money that you can get when running a well-organized botnet, not the money you get for a honest job well done. Sorry for the confusion). Is this what you do, in the case of safety? If so, this is interesting and I would like to know more. What do you do with your results, publish them? What is your affiliation? Where can I find a list of such publications? Or do you have a contract with someone who is paying you to assess the code under NDA, in which case, where does Open Source come into this model? Would you do your job for free if the code was open? Under a deadline?<p>> DO-178B is a process, and not a ""certification""<p>I used the words ""DO-178B certified"". As a Google search will confirm, I am not the first one to use this idiom. Since respectable actors are using it and have gone as far as buying it as Google AdWords, I stand by my use of these words.<p>> Static analysis is merely a tool, and is not a solution to this problem. You should be well aware of the limitations of Static analysis.<p>I didn't make any claims one way or the other. It is not unusual to meet people who have strong ideas on the subject, and I avoid this sterile discussion whenever I can.<p>I made clear in which sense I meant ""perfect safety record"". There were no casualties in Qantas' Flight 72. The report at <a href=""http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/docs/rapporten/Rapport_TA_ENG_web.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onderzoeksraad.nl/docs/rapporten/Rapport_TA_ENG_w...</a> is new to me. Thanks for the reference.<p>What always strikes me, when I read reports such as this, is the self-correcting attitude displayed by the relevant authorities. The question, when analyzing an incident, is always, ""how do we make sure the same mistake is not made again?"". The reason why I think public domain critical code will not happen is that there is no answer to this question \n(you can't make it more public domain the next time).<p>Again, I wish it was different. I just don't think it will happen in the foreseeable future.<p>> All safety critical systems will ultimately be ""public domain"" for this very reason.<p>Do you want to bet this practice has not been adopted in a single domain where it could apply by 2020?<p>It seems to me, but forgive me if I misunderstood your arguments, that you are saying ""Testing is not perfect. Static analysis is not perfect. Therefore, critical code has to be made public domain"". I'm not sure it follows. Whatever solution you are rooting for does not necessarily win by default because the other solutions are not perfect. Open source could win if it had something tangible to bring to the table. It wouldn't be automatic, and I am not even sure that the tangible advantages exist. Plane designers have been making software more and more complex because they could. If it turns out they can't complexify it any more, they can also just stop complexifying it. I can assure you that a company such as Boeing or Airbus would rather scale back on the new features used to promote new models than expose their designs to their competitors three years in advance (the code has to be verified before the first flight, right?).<p>At the risk of repeating myself, I am only describing the situation as I see it, not the way it would be convenient to me for it to be.<p>Pascal",1283812784

Launch sites are typically far away.

You'll notice that it combines BOTH elements. That 747 is flying within LOS of the missile path while in boost phase, and it's also using the fastest projectile possible.<p>You'll also note that the Patriot's role is medium tactical air defense as well as theater anti-ballistic missile defense.

To put it in another way: as the power of available machines grew by a factor of more than a thousand, society's ambition to apply these machines grew in proportion, and it was the poor programmer who found his job in this exploded field of tension between ends and means. The increased power of the hardware, together with the perhaps even more dramatic increase in its reliability, made solutions feasible that the programmer had not dared to dream about a few years before. And now, a few years later, he had to dream about them and, even worse, he had to transform such dreams into reality! Is it a wonder that we found ourselves in a software crisis? No, certainly not, and as you may guess, it was even predicted well in advance; but the trouble with minor prophets, of course, is that it is only five years later that you really know that they had been right.</i> -- E.

1667513,comment,1665218,1666372,0,0,Natsu,,,"> I don't get why ""talking politics"" is something to so desperately avoid in the US.<p>It's because there isn't a single party where you can't find crazy people who have no contact with reality who also hate anyone who disagrees with them.  Oh, and the blogs/online news comments are filled with paid political hacks during election season.  During the election, I noticed things like how the same guy got first post with the same username to every news story with comments on every paper at the top of Google News.  He vanished immediately after the election.  I think someone even paid their supporters openly.<p>Worse, feelings and identity have become much more important than facts (you don't vote for your political party, you <i>are</i> a Republican/Democrat/Libertarian/Green/Pirate/Socialist/Communist/Independent/I'm sorry if I left your party out) and it's simply not possible to discuss the issues in any depth without getting someone really mad.<p>Even if you can absolutely prove that X is untrue, you'll get a ""But $other_party is just as bad!  They did $bad_stuff (and that might even be true).  Why did you fail to mention that?  Why don't you hate them for that, too!?  You're not one of us, you're one of them!""<p>In short, rational debate has become impossible because there are strong feelings everywhere and it's just not worth it to anyone but strong partisans to jump into the fray (most people don't like being hated), so moderate voices are excluded and the US vs. THEM dynamic gets intensified.<p>Alas, this is infecting more than just politics.  I don't even want to touch the tech flamewars.",1283811232
