You're going to have to break backwards compatibility sometime, might as well start with a parallel OS<p>* Intellipad -- <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd861709%28VS.85%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd861709%28VS.85%29....</a>   I heard it would be something like emacs for .NET<p>* opening .NET -- mono is really close but isn't yet as polished as to attract the thousands of .NET developers.  Buying into the whole MS stack is too expensive for founders and small businesses but if development could be done on or in conjunction with open source environments, I imagine lots of Ruby (IronRuby), Python (IronPython), Java/Clojure (ClojureCLR) folks would be more willing to consider the market.<p>* SharePoint is beloved by all enterprise companies but ALL developers laugh at it.  Offer some kind of DLR API and I bet you could get lots of programmers more willing to support it.<p>* Command line -- go ahead and support unix commands and a more unix-like shell.  How could it hurt?<p>* MSDN licenses are ridiculous and clearly only for big companies.  Even startups that could start with BizSpark and ActionPack would rather use open source tools than be stuck in MSDN licensing hell.<p>* drop the price of Windows Server 08 Core to better compete with Linux servers<p>* start advertising better to non-enterprisey IT guys.",1284771581

I respect Eckersley's view and the dues he's paid to have that view, but I strongly disagree.<p>The economics of circumvention tools do not work.<p>One of the smallest regimes online activists target (the Islamic Republic of Iran) spends many, many tens of millions of dollars a year to fund militant groups in other countries. A safe estimate of the amount of money they would be capable of spending ""without blinking"" to defeat a newly-popular circumvention tool is 7 figures.<p>To put that rough figure in perspective, 7 figures may be more than any company has spent to assess the security of any release of any piece of software or hardware ever. Those assessments <i>always</i> find terrible things. So you have to start one of these projects assuming the responsibility for withstanding a 7 figure analytical assault by your adversary.<p>I think --- but can't support the thought with evidence --- that many advocates of circumvention tools are laboring under the idea that their adversaries aren't savvy enough to defeat these tools. For instance, ask anti-censorship advocates about the ""great firewalls"" or DPI systems; or don't, because they're bound to snicker about them to you anyways. We're talking about people dumb enough to think they can censor the Internet! How smart can they be?<p>Unfortunately, a million dollars demonstrably buys a <i>lot</i> of smart. Look to any major credit card exfiltration ring or botnet operator or pay-per-install site for evidence that there are many hundreds of people who can find vulnerabilities in software and are willing to do so for the highest bidder.<p>Into this environment, inject the fact that a vulnerability in circumvention software ""turns"" the tool, allowing it to be used as a dragnet to conduct sweeping arrests (or simply to create files on people for later use). We're talking about regimes that hang people from construction cranes for writing blog posts.<p>This isn't a technology problem.
