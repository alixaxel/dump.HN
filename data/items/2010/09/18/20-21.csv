That set of information — the information needed to convince my bank to send you money — is what I'm referring to as my ""password"", and that password is given by me to the merchant for every single credit card transaction.<p>I'll admit I don't know how the debit infrastructure works, but I do know that I must enter my PIN on a pad owned by the merchant.

Evidently, Cortez had gotten in trouble with the governor of Cuba, Then:<p>""Those of his men still loyal to the Governor of Cuba conspired to seize a ship and escape to Cuba, but Cortés moved swiftly to quash their plans. To make sure such a mutiny did not happen again, he decided to scuttle his ships, on the pretext that they were no longer seaworthy. There is a popular misconception that Cortés burned the ships to prevent further mutiny, instead Cortés scuttled all but at least one, which were simply ran aground. This misconception has been attributed to the reference made by Cervantes de Salazar in 1546 as to Cortés burning his ships.[7] This may have also come from a mistranslation of the version of the story written in Latin.[8]<p>With all of his ships scuttled except for one small ship with which to communicate with Spain, Cortés effectively stranded the expedition in the so-called New World and ended all thoughts of loyalty to the Governor of Cuba.

1704893,comment,1701032,1704069,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"I dispute the notion that it is ""easy"" and the implicit notion that it's better than a system with an intermediary.<p>* Inter-process condition variables are not supported on all operating systems. The next best thing would be sockets or message queues but these don't support broadcasting.<p>* Having multiple processes read and modify the same memory segment requires some kind of locking. Inter-process locks are expensive (or at least, more expensive than local-process locks) on most operating systems. On Linux a lock file is more expensive than a POSIX mutex. This can really kill performance compared to a system in which sockets are used to communicate with an intermediary and other bus listeners.<p>* Any process can corrupt the shared memory segment and screw up the state of all other processes that use it.<p>* With shared memory it becomes impossible to properly detect dead processes. Suppose a process connects to the bus and increases some kind of reference counter in the shared memory. If the process crash without properly decrementing the counter then other processes would never know that the number of processes would have gone down. You can add checks like checking whether other PIDs still exist but this is unreliable and kills performance.<p>If you can prove me wrong, that'd be great, because I'm looking for an IPC mechanism that's faster than Unix domain sockets.

1704870,comment,1704648,1704648,0,0,mayank,,,"A point and an idea:<p>(1) Modern classification algorithms like SVMs need some pretty hardcore math routines (SVMs require Quadratic Programming, which isn't trivial to implement correctly). Do you intend to implement these yourself? If so, that alone might be useful as a separate library, with the ML library built on top of it.<p>(2) I've been thinking about a JS distributed computing library for a long time -- sort of like Folding@Home, but instead of having to download a program, you just visit a website and let JS do the crunching (Ajax will pull and push data chunks). With modern JS engines, this has become more of a reality. So to bring it back to your question -- why not try to abstract as much of the math+algorithms from as many distributed computing projects as possible, and then build a generic JS library for doing distributed computation. You could have each distributed computing project as a benchmark -- i.e., start by implementing SETI@Home using your library, then move on to Folding@Home. I guarantee you won't be bored... ;)<p>Good luck, and I'm really glad people are pushing the capabilities of JS these days.<p>On a lighter note, can you imagine the derisive laughter if you had suggested this 10 years ago? :)",1284841474

For that matter, do you think today's Facebook source would withstand attack if posted on the internet tomorrow?<p>The question answers itself.<p>If it achieves its potential, Diaspora will be hardened to a considerable extent because of the scrutiny that open source provides.
