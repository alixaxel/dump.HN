In a nutshell, he is pointing out that the major cause of the current economic stagnation is a lack of cash flow. Deficits can not be increased forever, but absent cash flow then GDP will continue to shrink, increasing the relative size of a nation's debt. Boosting GDP (ideally through sensibly targeted investments in infrastructure) makes debt more manageable, not least because infrastructural investments tend to pay off over the long term.<p>With a little imagination and selectivity, a situation like this can be a good opportunity to reduce transfer payments and endorse productivity in both the social and industrial sectors.",1285639174

The first couple batches we were pretty tentative, because we didn't know it was going to work.<p>It's painful to consider whether it would have been best to do YC in SV year round from the start.  I loved alternating between the two places.  I still miss living in Cambridge. And yet the founders in the Boston batches probably were getting short shrift.  The startup community in Boston is so much smaller. We could never have organized something like Angel Day; there just aren't enough good angels.  We wouldn't even have had enough alumni in Boston, because most of the successful ones used to move to the Valley.<p>You can figure out what we'd do differently by what we've changed.  We give startups more money on average, but we don't give them any more for having more than 3 founders. Jessica now <i>strongly</i> encourages vesting, not to protect us, but to give startups a predefined way to deal with founders leaving. Interviews and Demo Day presentations are now much shorter, and I'd keep both short even if it weren't necessary for scale.  We look more at the people and less at the idea when making funding decisions.  We've added a bunch of protections against good groups falling through the cracks in applications. But we haven't changed that much structurally.  We've made a lot of mistakes, but they've mostly been one-offs, like funding startups we shouldn't have, or not funding startups we should.",1285636227

It hosted many a wonderful keynote speaker including Woz himself, and most of the original Macintosh engineering team, amongst others (Ken Arnold, Eric Raymond, David Pogue,  Andy Ihnatko, to name a few...)<p>We'd descend on the place every summer. In the old days, we'd have a massive machine room full of macs provided by sponsors.  Biggest LAN some of us yoots had ever seen, and boy did we play some Marathon on it. In later years, we took over the lobby of this place.<p>The Holiday Inn staff loved us.  We were courteous and kept after ourselves well.<p>Well, they liked us so much and thought we were so upstanding, they extended welcome to other ""hacker"" conferences that didn't go so well (think FBI making arrests in the lobby, vandalism, general hoodlum-ry).  In light of this, they approached us and eventually the conference heads folded and renamed it the ADHOC conference (Advanced Hands-On Developers Conference).  There were other circumstances, but the public perception of the concept of ""Hacker"" is what really did the deed.  It died a sad, sad death shortly afterward.<p><i>sigh</i> ...a rose by any other name...<p>RIP, MacHack. <i>sob</i> :)",1285635621
