1661258,comment,1658022,1660789,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"I'm starting to wonder if you read the paper or just glanced at it.<p><i>1. INTRODUCTION 
Most forms of life on Earth are adapted to growth within the temperature range, 10-45C. Microorganisms, known as thermophiles, however, grow optimally between 45C and 70C. Recently novel microbes, growing at temperatures above 80C have ben reported, and the upper temperature limit for growth has been extended to 113C and 121C by the discovery of  Pyrolobus fumarii  and “strain 121”, both having been isolated from hydrothermal vents (Kashefi and Lovley, 2003). Stetter  (1992) termed these newly discovered microorganisms “hyperthermophiles”. There also exist in the literature disputed claims that bacteria, isolated from black smokers can grow at 250C (Baross and Deming, 1983).  Louis and Kumar (2003) also reported that red cells which fell in so-called “Red Rain” over at Kerala in India (and which are studied here) could replicate at 300 C (Louis and Kumar, 2003, 2006), a claim that needs to be verified independently if it is to gain acceptance.</i><p>Wickramasingh and Wainwright were publicly critical of the earlier claims made by Louis and Kumar in 2003. This paper investigates one aspect of those claims by testing whether any growth of these cells take place, and if so whether it can occur at high temperatures. The answer to both those questions is 'yes'. It's reasonable to begin by investigating whether the phenomenon occurs at the known upper temperature bound mentioned in the first citation, and to solicit confirmation of that result, before investigating other conditions for growth whose very possibility is speculative at present.<p>I don't know why you're ragging on this paper so much. The news report is trash but the paper is cautious (indeed the Louis papers are a good deal more cautious than their linkbaity titles might suggest). Even if further study determines that that the cells are definitely terrestrial, the fact that such 'extremophiles' are not confined to extreme environments like the walls of volcanoes or undersea is itself news.",1283550173

Sometimes natural selection actually increases variability by favoring outliers (specialists) over the average (generalists).<p>Consider a population with two food sources that require slightly different characteristics to access, for example, food sources at different water depths.  They'll be most easily accessed by creatures whose neutral buoyancy puts them at that depth of water.
