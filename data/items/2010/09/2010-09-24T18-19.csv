Tablespoon of salt and all that.<p>These sorts securities were structured in such a way that some people get a lower ROI, but better risk profile.  The way that works is that whoever accepts the lowest rate of return gets their portion first.  When the money runs out, the assets that would have the highest rate of return miss out entirely.<p>There are two major ways that a loan can change:  default (where the debtor simply does not pay; this typically leads to foreclosure and the bank often takes a loss) and renegotiation (where the debtor negotiates a reduction in how much the debtor will eventually need to pay on the theory that the lower amount will make default less likely).  Both of these reduce the amount of money coming in (and, indeed, the amount that is ever going to come in).<p>What happened is that the amount of money coming in (and expected to come in) dropped to the point where, after paying every asset promising a lower rate than Toxie, there was no money left to pay Toxie.

If we ever offer Introduction to Oil Painting we'll probably do a lot more videos for that course.<p>Philosophically, we are avoiding the notion of live video formats for a couple of reasons. First, there are products that exist to do live video today (Skype, etc.). But more importantly, the big benefit of an online course is that because the course has no set meeting time, students and instructors can time-shift (this is the same benefit of email versus talking on the phone). With live video, you lose that.

1724879,comment,1724395,1724395,0,0,mhartl,,,"I doubt there's anything terribly wrong with cutting out dietary grains, but the basis for a ""paleo"" diet appears to rest on two principal assumptions:<p>1. Pre-agricultural humans didn't eat grains<p>2. The human digestive system has evolved little since the introduction of agriculture<p>The problem is that both of these assumptions are dubious at best. If paleolithic humans didn't eat grains, then how were grains ever domesticated in the first place? Obviously, <i>someone</i> was eating grains in the wild, and evidently over time people learned how to cultivate them. I have no trouble believing that the paleo diet contained far fewer grains than the typical post-agricultural diet, but that suggests eating select whole grains in moderation, not eliminating them entirely.<p>In addition, the idea that ten thousand years isn't enough time for substantial evolution is clearly wrong. The reason the New World was ravaged by smallpox, plague, influenza, etc., upon contact with Europeans was because Americans (in the generalized sense) lacked the resistance that Eurasians had evolved in the time since the invention of agriculture. Meanwhile, some people (especially northern Europeans) have no trouble digesting milk because they evolved the ability to metabolize lactose—presumably a recent innovation, since dairy animals were domesticated around the same time as grains. (Yet many ""paleo"" advocates also recommend eschewing dairy.) Indeed, ""lactose intolerance"" is a misnomer; what's remarkable is that anyone is lactose-tolerant—lactose-tolerant humans are the only mammals to produce the necessary lactase enzyme as adults. There is every reason to expect that a similar evolutionary process has led to an enhanced ability to digest grains; it may not be true, but it should be the null hypothesis.<p>In short, the basic idea of eating nutrient-dense foods is based on sound science, but the complete elimination of perfectly healthy foods such as whole grains and dairy doesn't have any basis in reality.",1285354456

Also, there's potentially more room for refactoring than feature changes.<p>2. The same way software commits or Wikipedia edits are evaluated. Discussion and voting.

As ry's node is the official Node.js, ""usgov"" would host the legally binding repo, and individuals would simply have their own non-binding forks.

Because failure is nothing to feel bad about unless it becomes a predictable occurrence.<p>When you've got your breath back and blood pressure is approaching normal, consider opening up about it. While you may not be able to talk about all of it for legal reasons (eg it seems like your partner was rather dubious), sharing what you have learned from the experience, what red flags you saw but why they didn't seem worth stopping for etc. is valuable to many people. I'm easily embarrassed myself, so I know it's difficult; but don't fall into the trap of anticipating only the negative possibilities, and cutting yourself off from the sympathy and support of people who like you.<p>Now, I don't mean 'Tell HN: OK it was me ohgodImsorry'; you don't need to humiliate yourself! Take a long bath/walk on the beach/whatever, and let go of the situation for a few hours. You poured your own money into it in an attempt to keep things under control, and it was just just bigger than you were. What happens next is in the hands of others, and you can influence but not control it. Then write your creditors, mostly the same letter, and tell them what you told us - you owe this much to these different people, you have lost a bunch of your own money, [EDIT: I misinterpreted the stuff about your co-founder, as if the person had bailed on you.], and you're sorry. Express your willingness to pay it back ASAP, but stress that you wish to do it on a pro rata basis. Of course every creditor would like to be paid first ahead of the others, but making the same information available to all indicates you have nothing to hide and is more reassuring than a non-credible promise to put someone first. If you can afford it, a small check to each, even $25 or something, speaks volumes.You might want to write to the IRS and the city or county that issues your business license too - if you're not sure what to tell them, call and ask what your obligations are. You may be surprised how helpful they can be. you can call them today and get the letters out before you go to bed (go buy some stamps if you need an excuse to get up and walk around). Then, sleep the sleep of the just. Get up tomorrow, eat a healthy breakfast, and start composing your 'How I lost a kajillion dollars and what I learned as my business followed it off a cliff' post , on your existing blog, Posterous, wherever. Throw in a couple of ironically entertaining pictures. It's not a funeral notice because you're not dead - you are now a man or woman of experience, and that experience has a value. Get that up over the weekend, realize people still like you, and on Monday you get back to work.<p>Your job for the next week is to contact the creditors again, ensure they all have the same information, and politely but firmly stick with the pro-rata approach. Whether they agree or no, ask for their decision in writing so you can send copies to the other creditors. By the way, since it sounds like you're not in debt on your personal accounts, consider dropping by your own bank and asking a manager for advice - since they won't actually be trying to collect from you, they may be more forthcoming about how they evaluate situations like that, and heaven knows they've had plenty of experience lately. Allocate 50% of your time to debt service, and the other 50% to making some new money. That can include chasing consulting/programming work, but your existing business still has value. Call business magazines like Inc. people like Andrew Warner etc., and say you have an interesting story - use your war story post and the feedback you received on it as your raw material. Hell, call Techcrunch, because they can't milk that SuperAngel scandal forever so you might as well work the publicity angle and give them an interview. 'Life after death' is a perennial story and even success junkies need one every so often. How about your startup's business model? Your actual business may have failed, but that doesn't mean the idea itself is without merit. Can you sell the IP, or the brand, or the analytics, or the customer list, or the suspicious transactions list? Some of these may be worth money, some not, but all that information has value in some form. Just pretend you inherited it from Uncle Debtscrewed and find that value. Can you make some value out of the domain? Can you write a book?<p>Yes. You can do all of that, and more. Because although we all laugh when a clown steps on a banana peel and falls flat on his face, what we applaud is that he gets up again afterwards. So you don't have time to brood; you launch next Monday.",1285354275

Do they receive a check for their portion of the asset sale? That would offset the the numbers I should imagine. So if they have collected roughly $450 of their $1000 investment and then receive a $300 check from the asset sale. that is $750 of their principal returned. In regards to the banks that hold these assets they received a bailout so I would assume that they still see a profit on these ""Toxic""assets due to the bail out. As well this asset was purchased in the middle of the housing fall out while some of the other assets had been producing returns for some time before this whole mess. Also what about that PMI they make people buy if they finance more than 80% that is supposed to protect the mortgage holders principal, in the event of a default.

If it works, and you can prove there's a business there, then by all means, spend the money to make it perform as well as you possibly can.  Design in this sense is an 'optimization' technique, not part of the core product.<p>The flip side, is if you have a horrible idea, and you spend $10k on design, you've effectively thrown that money away.<p>The exceptions to this, of course, are in the demographic.  If your target market is web designers, they're going to be hypercritical of any design, so it needs to excel from day 1.  If your startup is an iPhone app, same thing.  Otherwise, most people will be forgiving of a spartan design, so long as the damn thing works, and that'll give you leverage to design against.<p>Also, another big point in this is that as you build the product, you'll change how things work, a lot.  In the application I'm building now, I had Photoshop mockups for every page, and how I thought they would look, but in the initial testing, I've changed almost every page somewhat dramatically.

Communication speed is related to things like redundancy and vocabulary.<p>A language with a lot of redundancy, like English or Java, is slower than one with generally less reduandancy, like Japanese or Python. Redundancy can be within syntax (like long words), or with context (like implied subjects in Japanese, writing ""self"" in Python, or declaring types in Java) - redundancy protects against signal/context loss, but its cost is in speed.<p>Vocabulary represents an abstraction of a concept. A person with a smaller vocabulary in a particular topic will take longer to express a concept than one with a large vocabulary in that area. If a language has a small vocabulary in a particular area, it will be slower than a better suited language.<p>In the end, getting the message across is more important than the speed of getting it there, but if you have a choice, use only as much redundancy as you need to get the signal across, and choose the language which gives you the largest domain specific vocabulary.",1285353453

That's how the web grew to be so big: it didn't matter if you were running UNIX or Windows or Mac, you could access the same information as anyone else, and you could contribute back.<p>Content that is produced with Silverlight is Microsoft-only, so if you are in an environment where you can't install closed plugins, or if you just don't want to, then you can't see the content. The same goes for Flash of course: the only reason it took off is because it could do things that the regular web couldn't. That's slowly becoming less and less true now, and Silverlight is just not needed.<p>However, Microsoft is pushing Silverlight because it locks people into their software: if enough people use it to build content, then everyone will <i>have</i> to continue using Microsoft software. That is completely incompatible with The Web and all it stands for.<p>I don't know how Microsoft should make money. But the way they're aiming themselves into the future is doomed to fail. I get that they probably understand their space is dying, but the problem is that they're not looking for alternatives. They're just pushing the same products they have been for decades.<p>If they know that won't work, why are they trying it? Look, I haven't got the answer and if I did I'd be rich.

An add-on to this definition is the ability to answer basic comprehension question questions about these sentences.<p>2.  A person can reason upon, expand upon, interpret, or otherwise think about the words he has read.<p>3.  A person can read fiction and appreciate it in some way.<p>#1 seems like an obvious necessity for life in a society where so much is communicated via written language.  #2 seems like necessary skill for someone to be a high-functioning adult.

That's what checks and balances are for.  It takes a long time to see the full implications of each law (look what happened when Glass-Steagall was repealed), and if the laws change every day, you can end up whipsawing with no idea what really works or not.<p>2. How will the laws be evaluated?  In the U.S, you have judicial review, where cases come before the courts, the facts come out into the open, a jury of your peers evaluates how the law applies to those facts, and then the appellate court system ensures the law was applied correctly.  If the law is egregiously wrong, there's widespread publicity and then public pressure to amend the law.  How does this same sort of fact-based discovery process factor into your system, and how do you avoid it devolving into a ""he said she said"" contest of differing opinions?<p>3. How will you get public buy-in?  Democracy's based upon the consent of the governed; when everybody writes their own version of the laws, each person could make the argument that they didn't consent to the other person's version.<p>4. It seems like this would replace plutocracy (government by the rich and well-connected) with technocracy (government by the quick-thinking and technically savvy).  As a technocrat, I'm all in favor of that. ;-) But it seems like you're just exchanging one set of masters for another, and in many ways, this new system is <i>less</i> fair than the old one.

You won't see Envelop From unless you dig through email headers.  It's really just part of the SMTP conversation before your mail server starts sending the actual message (header and body).  Your desktop email program probably makes these two addresses the same, but your mailing list software needn't.<p>2) When Joe User replies to an email on purpose, his email client WILL use the From address (or Reply-to, but never mind that).<p>3) There is a clever idea called VERP (Variable Envelope Return Path) that exploits this, where you make the Envelope From different for every email you send to a list.  If you send me an email and your mailing list software made the Envelope From, ""newsletter+haroldp=internal.org@joelonsoftware.com"" and it bounced, your MTA could route that bounced message to the ""newsletter@joelonsoftware.com"" account, and use the encoded email address in there to figure out that it was my address that bounced.  The To address on the message should point to a human's mailbox.

1724631,comment,1724247,1724247,0,0,jimdotrose,,,"First point of advice would be to take a deep breath and slow way, way down. Everyone is pressuring you because they know you don't have cash and they want to get paid first before everyone else out of a dwindling set of assets.  Slow the process down.  Time - although it may not seem like it now - is on your side.  Don't sell your car, don't take on a consumer loan.  Slow down.<p>Your debt, while big to you, is minimal to the people you are working with, so they should be open to working through the issue with you.<p>a) Your lawyer, if it's a big firm, probably has a $2-3mm+ book, and a non-collection of $3k isn't going to effect them one bit.  S/he has an incentive to work with you to come to an agreement on payment (if any) to maintain the relationship.  Treat them with respect and you will get it in return. Deal with this bill last because it will be the easiest to manage.<p>b) $6k rackspace bill.  Escalate the issue through the accounts payable department by explaining the situation and telling them they aren't going to get paid in full.  If the first person on the phone doesn't get it, escalate to the next level, then the next level, etc.  The gatekeeper's job is to put pressure on you to pay and create anxiety, which they seem to have done.<p>Once you get someone willing to work with you, fight to reduce the balance and then extend the payables as much as possible.  For the value of the balance, figure out what rackspace could get by selling your receivable to a collections agency and offer slightly more - if they get $.18 per dollar owed, agree to pay $.19.  Then, stretch the time period as much as possible.<p>c) Merchant account. This is where I would focus.  This is your greatest exposure. Even if you didn't sign a personal guarantee, this could follow you professionally.  Get on the phone with the merchant account holder and start dealing.  Get the balance down to their cost first (that shouldn't be hard), and then see if you can grind it down farther.  They have a loss reserve for this exact reason.  Be open and transparent and pay the least amount possible while avoiding getting on the blacklist.<p>Bankruptcy (I'm not an attorney, so take this with the necessary grain of salt) is the last resort.  It's long and painful for everyone involved - including you - and none of your creditors want to go there.  Your creditors have an interest in working out your debts with you without going to court.",1285351755

It relies on physics, but it does not ""perform physics"" in the same way that a computer performs calculations.<p>This is why software patents are always framed in terms of <i>a machine performing an algorithm</i>.  The ""machine-performing-an-algorithm"" construct is not itself mathematical, though it does rely on mathematics.  The FSF's argument there is that having a machine perform an algorithm is now sufficiently obvious to fall under the obviousness restriction (while perhaps it was not so obvious back in the 1950s).

This is much, <i>much</i> meatier.  Compare ""Foreign Affairs"" magazine with a free college-town newspaper or something like that.  The former is all content, the latter is <i>some</i> content, and a ton of adverts.<p>2) A lot of the stories that were making it on digg were blogspammy nonsense, for the most part.  It was lots of top 10 lists, 7 reasons why list, thinly veiled excuses to feature half-naked women, etc.<p>The problem was that is there <i>is</i> a market for people who want both 1 and 2, but these people mostly don't want to have to <i>work</i> to find this stuff.

There were people who were <i>tolerating</i> both cases because of the few good stories that did make it through, but digg took these away and showed them nothing but top 10 lists until they find people to follow.  Bad move.<p>If Kevin (or whoever is steering the ship now) wants to save it, they need <i>Kevin</i> to get on the air and publicly say that he screwed up (even if it wasn't him), is sorry, and that they're going to go back to what they had before.<p>Honestly though, it might be too late.
