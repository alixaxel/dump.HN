It would be wasteful not to tap in to those dollars.<p>As Patio11 elsewhere already pointed out adsense is a form of micropayments, and micropayments are the 'pay-as-you-go' of subscriptions.<p>The only problem with that is that adsense is not transparent and it doesn't allow you to set your own price. In fact, you don't even know how much your inventory is really worth.<p>So if your site does not have a very tight coupling between the users and the sites, one that you expect to last for many months or years advertising is actually a very good solution, but adsense in particular may not be the best you can do.<p>Another problem with adsense is the fact that clickfraud benefits both google <i>and</i> the fraudsters, so for advertisers it is very difficult to track whether they're spending their money correctly or not.<p>I wished someone would start to give google some serious competition in this space.",1265043577

1092757,comment,1091814,1092248,0,0,sailormoon,,,"Hm, I guess I don't know what you're referring to. I am mainly talking about NSLs, since that's what we know about, but that's an FBI thing - a relatively ""open"" agency, as these things go. I imagine the other three-letter agencies have their own versions whose existence is not yet on the record.<p>The very existence of the NSLs, however, kind of sweeps all these pleasant ideals of due process and transparency off the table. They're a legal warrant for any information whatsoever, can be signed and validated by any FBI field officer, and the recipient is legally obliged to keep the fact of their receipt a secret. There have been hundreds of thousands of such letters issued.<p>Better yet, the FBI has gotten sick of writing the letters, and the recipients know they have no chance of resisting giving up the information, so nowadays they're not even writing them. See the above article. And as a commenter on that piece writes, if you believe for one second that the FBI has mended its ways since 2007, I have a bridge to sell you.<p>There are no barriers whatsoever to law enforcement or national security services getting whatever data they want, whenever they want, with no oversight whatsoever. And if you extrapolate a little, taking into account developments such as the NSA's new $2b, 65MW data centre in Utah, I bet the intelligence agencies have full bulk data access and probably a replication of all major email and social networking providers' data for mining purposes.<p>I don't think any of this could be called a conspiracy theory any more. It's just the reality of world we live in. We might not know all the details yet, but the writing is very clearly on the wall. I congratulate your skepticism and lack of credulity - we sure need more of that in the world - but most or all of this is real and happening right now. The new system was called TIA, then it was called ADVISE. Its current codename is unknown, it was supposedly cancelled, but whaddya know, that data centre is still being built, and another similar facility in Texas. What do you think they're for?<p>Remember, ECHELON was a ""conspiracy theory"" too once. The very nature of classified activity is that we don't know all the details while it's going on. But we can sure connect the dots. And there's an awful lot of dots.",1265043369

I kind of thought of it as a way to ease myself between a cushy paycheck and the wild.<p>Overall, my conclusion is that business school is pretty useless for starting a business. Very few people start companies straight out of top business schools (too much money in taking job), and most of what you ""learn"" about entrepreneurship isn't actually all that useful.

That, in turn, usually led to stability.<p>The great exception to this is of course the Mongol Empire. They were the largest empire in history, led by just a few people, and they were incredibly destructive. They had a certain distaste for cities and everything that they represented (education, culture, liberalism), so they became an unstoppable destructive force. The ""What If"" book claims that some regions of the world are still feeling of the effects of this.

It took me less than a day to realize that the guy sitting next to me is clearly much smarter than I am [..] without false modesty I wouldn't be surprised to find that I'm as high as being in the top 0.1% in general intelligence (however that could be measured).</i><p>This strikes me as a problem, rather than an achievement. Google seems to be jam packed with highly intelligent eggheads, but Google isn't a pure science company - they're trying to work with consumers too. Most of the most successful businessmen and entrepreneurs I know don't come even close to the top 1% of intelligence (and are often even dyslexic) as they need a wider range of faculties like common-sense, charisma, creativity, and ""emotional intelligence.""<p>Maybe this guy's in the engineering department and Google <i>does</i> hire a lot of creatives, business types, and what not, but their products have a rather sterile edge that makes me think the engineers always win over there..",1265040683

Oh, so can the FBI raid the offices of any corporation without a warrant?  Could Congress pass a law prohibiting CNN from covering a war?  Obviously, the Constitution should prohibit these things, and it does.<p>The reason the court did not elaborate on its classification of corporations as ""speakers"" in the context of the First Amendment is that it's settled law, with a long history you could look up on Wikipedia, and none of the justices (even the dissenting ones) disagree with that classification.  The dissent of the minority was based on the idea that even though corporations should enjoy a strong right to free political speech, the state's interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption is great enough that it should be restricted in this case.<p>Addendum:  No, I don't think this is a really good situation, although I doubt that the sky will fall; corporations already find ways to shovel about as much money as they might like at candidates.  However, I think that it's just a consequence of two root problems -- the first being the great inequality of wealth (and therefore power) in our society, being nearly all concentrated in a rich elite; the second being the lack of serious and/or compulsory public financing for campaigns, so that wealth is usually a prerequisite to being elected.",1265040323
