The actions of one customer can effect hundreds of other customers. For example, we saw a specific firmware revision that caused the modem's burst modulator (upstream signal) to turn on a high power constant carrier in certain circumstances which would DoS all the modems on the same upstream offline. I've heard this was responsible for a massive outage in Phoenix last year due to 8 modems being upgraded before the code was fully tested. If you upgrade the firmware yourself it's putting other people at risk -- including digital phone subscribers who may be using their services as a life line. Changing your MAC address has some risk simply because MACs are supposed to be unique. You could accidentally DoS another customer offline by doing it although statistically the chances are pretty low you'd use another subscriber's MAC but it does happen from time to time when someone simply increments the last digit of the MAC address.",1264999991

1091802,comment,1091650,1091650,0,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"Here's a little list, not from a web developer's perspective, but from the perspective of someone who <i>really</i> wanted to write apps for the iPhone OS but is turned-off by the AppStore. Did I say turned-off? I meant outraged. Offended. Disgusted.<p>1. Neither the iPhone nor the iPad are going to replace full-blown computers. They're neither powerful enough nor comfortable enough for serious work. Of course, the situation could change dramatically a few years from now, but I'm sure we'll figure something out when the time comes. For now, get a Mac and have a blast hacking it :)<p>2. If you think Apple's touch devices have taken the world by storm and everything else pales in comparison, I humbly suggest you come to New Delhi and count the number of iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad owners. Most of the world just can't afford to spend cash on shiny entertainment devices. People are still going to buy and use computers. You can still write apps for Mac OS X/Linux/Windows. The world has not yet ended.<p>3. Most of the apps you find on the AppStore could conceivably be written as webapps. Why bother with ObjC and Cocoa when you can just use JavaScript+HTML5? A large percentage of apps just pull data from a server and display it in pretty boxes. On the other hand, if you're writing a game, you're already a ""special case"" and have to play by Apple's rules -- which are not different from what Microsoft/Nintendo/Sony impose on their developers. So, for most of your programming needs, JavaScript+HTML5 should be enough.<p>4. Have we forgotten that these days, Apple are an entertainment and content distribution company who just <i>happen</i> to make computers? Apple are not marketing the iPad as a general-purpose computer; they want to sell it as an entertainment device. Since it's a niche device, in the grand scheme of things, the closed nature of the iPhone OS doesn't really matter.<p>This list doesn't do much to allay the major concerns of the tech community: the iPad <i>is</i>, in fact,  a full-blown computer that is hopelessly locked-in by Apple and their delusional policies, that it could be much more than just an entertainment device, that we have something radically different from the traditional model of computing but cannot exploit the thousands of possibilities this gives us. This list is just an indication that we mustn't lose hope yet. Let the guys in Cupertino figure out when - if ever - they want to loosen their grip on the iPhone OS ecosystem. In the meantime, we'll just write web apps :)<p>EDIT: In a previous comment, I mentioned I don't want to write JavaScript. It's true. But I can put up with JS if it means I don't have to sell out to Apple.",1264999501

If we can accept that the printed book is no longer the primary artifact, we can accept that we no longer need huge publishing houses to wrap all of the costs in.<p>The cost differences between producing a paper book and an eBook are striking to me. I read the linked article and it makes some imaginative leaps in assigning all costs to the eBook venture, resulting in some ridiculous numbers.  If you compare the costs of physically printing the book to publishing an eBook, there is obviously a huge difference. Look at lulu.com for starters on this.<p>On the other hand, his argument for flexible pricing is quite sensible.  The difference as we go to eBooks will be that the popular books will cost more, and the less popular books will cost less, as we get the physical production costs out of the way and the overhead is greatly reduced.<p>Just like recording artists and labels, authors will separate from publishers, as publishers fragment into the the physical production, editorial service providers and financial risk backing operations.",1264999217

Much of the ""complexity"" of US tax code is part of the long legislative history of closing tax loopholes that large businesses have successfully exploited to escape taxation in the past.<p>But even if you don't take my word on this, he actually does call for tax cuts in the post:<p><i>""Make capital gains on investments up to $1mm in small companies tax free""</i><p>This has nothing to do with ""streamlining"" the tax code.  Cuban wants the ability to invest in hedge funds and other ""small businesses"" without paying capital gains tax on the profits, and he's framing it as a way of ""encouraging investment"" in the mom and pop store down the street (who will never, ever be assisted by this kind of a policy change).  In reality, Cuban is proposing yet another loophole that would be used primarily by rich people and large corporations to escape taxation.",1264998044

1091763,comment,1091282,1091688,0,0,Lazlo_Nibble,,,"<i>For me</i> (and I don't claim this calculus works for anyone else) an ebook is overpriced if I can get a discounted or used copy of a print version for the same amount or less. The print copy has intrinsic value; I can resell it, lend it out, donate it to a ""books for prisoners"" program or leave it to my grandkids; it requires no additional hardware, and I'll be able to read it anywhere, anytime for the rest of my life. If I drop it down a sewer grate or forget it in a cab, I'm out no more than the replacement cost of the book (which is probably out in paperback now). If I throw it in a box in the attic and leave it there, barring the Rise of the Silverfish I'll be able to pull the box back down again in ten years and pick right back up reading it again.<p>But the electronic copy has <i>no</i> intrinsic value; I can't resell it, lend it out, or donate it; it requires additional hardware to use, and I can only read it on the platform(s) the vendor allows me to read it on for as long as the vendor allows me to read it. If I'm reading on my PC, I can't change platforms or upgrade my OS unless the proprietary reader software is available for the platform/OS I'm moving to. If the vendor decides to adopt another format or leave the business entirely, my books suddenly have a drop-dead date: once my hardware breaks, I lose the titles I've bought forever.<p>A lot of these issues go away with non-DRMed titles, but in all but a few cases (bulky tech reference titles for example) a DRM-free eBook is still unlikely to be worth as much to me as the print version.<p>And you really don't want to get into the ""dollars per hour"" argument here. The iPhone game I just finished up cost me a dollar and I got a good 20+ hours of play time out of it. But I can get through an average-sized book in four or five hours, so if I went by price per enjoyment-hour, it'd make that book worth about twenty-five cents.

I think you'd find that most Americans - Democrats, Independents and Republicans are unhappy with how much was spent under Bush, but by the same token, I don't think it's unreasonable to note that the deficit under the Obama administration  <i>last year alone</i> was $1.074 trillion dollars while the Bush administrations had an average annual budget deficit of about $104 billion per year.<p>Let me repeat and rephrase given how stunning it is - the Obama administration's deficit last year alone was greater than all the deficits combined under the Bush Administration including all the war spending.  I think it's fair to argue that last year was unusual but deficits are also projected to remain high for the forseeable future and the Obama administration has additional significant spending programs in the years beyond his current proposed modest spending freeze.<p>EDIT - I erred - I used an average of 104 billion under the Bush administration when it was an average of 104 billion under the 12 years of the Republican controlled budgets which extends into Clinton's last administration.
