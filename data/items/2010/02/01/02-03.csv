1091653,comment,1091074,1091291,0,0,glhaynes,,,"""We're going to have HTML5 for the next twenty years...""<p>Everybody's going to get up to speed with implementation of HTML5 and then ... stop? The story of HTML5 so far has been a mix of browsers chasing/leading the standards. In other words, the standards and the browsers are evolving together rapidly. I don't see why that would stop anytime soon. Certainly all this innovation won't ground to a halt when HTML5 submits their final release to the W3C (or whatever the next ""formal"" step is at this point).<p>Will there be some instance of an installed browser today that will still be running on a machine somewhere in 20 years? Well, probably... but remember that guy a couple of years ago that still had a CP/M system running his business? He wasn't holding anybody back.<p>And once everybody's on modern, standards-compliant browsers (and thus there's less friction for upgrading, i.e. there's no more ""all our corporate apps only run in IE6""), I expect far more people will upgrade far more often. The web is at a really, really exciting time if you ask me.<p>So: non-Flash web technologies can reliably handle some percentage of Flash use cases today. Certainly more than a couple of years ago, and that appears to be about to go up again a lot more as HTML5 sweeps across the web. The number of use cases that require Flash are going to continue to get smaller and smaller over time. When will Flash be utterly irrelevant to the average user? I don't know. But WAY less than 20 years from now.",1264992472

1091651,comment,1091282,1091605,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Every word of your analysis and reflection is spot on regarding the importance of time-sensitive pricing, incenting authors to produce great works, and, what I believe, is my _moral_ responsibility to reward those authors/software publishers/directors/actors/content creators who give me so much pleasure.  I'm happy to see there are others out there who share my worldview.<p>So, I think it's really important to emphasize, that Amazon wasn't suggesting non time-sensitive pricing, instead, they were requesting the ability to set the prices, EVEN IF it meant they would pay Macmillan $25 and sell a book for $9.99.<p>The net result would be - I get a great book, day one, cheap.  MacMillan (and the author) get their cut of the $25.  Amazon gets my business.  (Because, once I'm at amazon.com, good chance I'll go back when buying my EOS 7D). Walmart mastered the art of selling something at a loss to get you in the door, Amazon is just following in their well understood footsteps.<p>The publishing industry, though, has done the analysis and realized that setting a price point of $9.99 constantly, means that readers will have a difficult time paying more than that.  Which means that, eventually, Amazon.com doesn't have to sell the books at a loss, because that is the only price that books will sell at.<p>I don't really buy the argument - I'm going to purchase the next Peter Hamilton Void Series Book on Day 1, even if it is $50; but clearly the publishing companies do, because they desperately want to control the price that the _reader_ sees, regardless of what the publisher is being paid.  Ergo, the ""Agency Model"".  Amazon is no longer a Book Buyer/Seller for MacMillan, and will not be able to discount eBooks to get more volume.<p>There is a meta-game being played here, and it is for control of the Channel - to some degree, the party that controls the pricing controls the channel.  If Amazon can set the pricing to a below-cost number, then they grow their (already strong) control over the channel, and make it up on all the other elements that people purchase.  By turning Amazon into an Agency that has to price their books at the same price as everyone else, Macmillan has regained that control.",1264992377

To me, there's no reason for the publisher to exist at all (not that the various functions they provide don't need to be done, just that they don't need to be provided by a single large entity).<p>Not to mention that, as sold, Ebooks represent a drastically _worse_ value than paper books.

It turns out, according to my favorite authors, that time-sensitive pricing is a huge part of what makes the economics of their business work. After all, an author's hardcore fans are willing to pay more, and time-sensitive pricing -- with books costing more on the day of release, then gradually getting cheaper -- is the established mechanism for extracting that premium. The ""hardcover"" vs ""softcover"" vs ""remaindered"" thing is the industry's way of signalling the different price points.<p>I've suddenly started looking at hardcover buyers with more respect.

We'll save on printing and shipping, but that may be about it. There just aren't tons of excess profits sitting around in book publishing: The audiences are too small. I might not even save money on bricks and mortar: I <i>like</i> visiting bookstores or the equivalent, even if just to sit and drink tea while surrounded by media.",1264990278

This argument does not hold up in general, and it is especially weak when arguing about using encryption algorithms with freely available, high quality implementations.  The developer effort required to use bcrypt is minimal.<p>Also, you seem to be making the incorrect assumption that only poorly written web applications get their databases compromised.  Web applications with excellent security get their databases stolen for a variety of other reasons.  Even if the programmers do everything right, a careless employee might get his/her password sniffed or stolen by a key logger.  If a company uses external hosting, its database could get stolen because of a mistake by the hosting providers.<p>In summary, the risk of your database being stolen is always present, regardless of the diligence of the the programmers who implemented the web application.

1091590,comment,1091159,1091520,0,0,hristov,,,"That is quite correct. If you look up the mathematical definition of associativity, the behaviour of the ""<"" does not fit it. In fact associativity is only a property that can be possessed by functions or operations that operate on a particular set. Thus, both the inputs and the result of the function or operation have to belong to the set. For the ""<"" operation, the inputs are numbers and the result is boolean. A boolean value cannot be an input for the ""<"" operation (if you take the classical definition of ""<""). Therefore, ""<"" does not operate on a particular set. Therefore ""<"" cannot be associative.<p>The behaviour of ""<"" the author refers to is not associativity. Therefore, the languages he criticises do not really get associativity wrong, he just needs to brush up on his math.<p>Now you can say ""well, ok this behaviour is not associativity but it is a well know behaviour of ""<"" and "">"". Why can't the languages get it right?"" I think the answer is that this (a<b<c<d) is one of those notations that look ok in algebra class but are really problematic if you actually try to define and use a logically consistent function notation, so it is not a problem for me, if some languages do not perform (a<b<c<d) as expected in order to keep their semantics clean.",1264989767
