1093570,comment,1093433,1093524,0,0,tptacek,,,"I'm really unhappy with this Gizmodo review, but they've got the steak part nailed. It's exactly like they say: you take a steak, bag it (I season it and throw some butter in), and then set the temperature for 130. Wait one hour or 48 hours or any time in between: you will get a uniformly perfect steak.<p>Do this two or three times and you'll stop poking or probing the final product. It simply <i>is</i> 130f, inside and out, when you remove it from the bag. Checking the temperature is essentially second-guessing a very very accurate electronic thermometer.<p>The quality of that finished product will be higher than anything you can accompish on cast iron, because cast iron doesn't heat meat uniformly. To get a rare center on cast iron, you have to accept a medium-well band of meat on the outside of the steak. Skill and technique dictate how wide that band is, but it's there regardless.<p>What you lose in SV is the seared crust. So, of course, after you cook your steak SV, you sear the outside --- for seconds, not minutes, on each side --- and then plate.<p>There are three major benefits of SV for steaks.<p>First, no matter who you are, SV is the one way you can set up a couple steaks in the morning before you leave for work and come home with a perfectly cooked steak waiting. It's this benefit that makes me think SV is the future for the American kitchen.<p>Second, if you're a typical home cook, SV kills the margin of error. Unless you type the wrong temperature in, you're getting a perfectly cooked steak no matter what you do.<p>Third, if you're a pro chef, SV frees you from having to be an extremely expensive meat thermometer. Electronics are better at watching temperatures than people are. Chefs are freed from the drudgework of monitoring cooking, and can spend that time innovating or refining actual dishes.",1265061281

Obviously a programmer with only C++ or Java experience could not; I only mentioned those languages for contrast, because you wouldn't hire someone to write C++ unless they were already a good C++ programmer.<p>The differences in style between Python and Ruby or Python and Perl, modulo the differences related to the available language features (which enforce themselves, and which account for most of the difference), are on the same scale as style differences between different C++ shops.  You expect a good C++ programmer to adapt to the local dialect (assuming he has the technical chops to do so), so why wouldn't you expect a Perl programmer to adapt to Python?  There's no way you would pass up a smart Perl or Ruby programmer for a Python job.  (Vice-versa is another matter.)<p>As for experience with other tools, looking at Python in that context actually strengthens my point.  When you interview a developer, you don't bother asking about build tools, IDEs, SCMs, or testing frameworks unless they're applying to be the local guru.  I've <i>never</i> asked a candidate if he knew how to build a .deb package.  I've <i>never</i> worried about how much a candidate knows about Eclipse.  (Or Jira, or gdb, or cvs.)  The cumulative amount of tool-specific knowledge required to do my job dwarfs the complexity of Python, but I really don't bother with that stuff when I'm interviewing somebody for my group.<p>A big technology like Django might be a different question.  Django (as much as I've seen of it) seems to be considerably more complicated than Python.  I could see wanting to hire a Django developer.

I place very little <i>intrinsic</i> value on the paper book, myself, other than as a delivery mechanism. As you point out, however, since I can resell it, the market places non-zero value on some instances of paper books[1].<p>Since the value, for me, is entirely in the convenience of delivery, hardback books, by their bulkier, heavier nature, have less value than mass market paperbacks. I even wrinkle my nose at ""trade"" paperbacks[2]. The size of the current crop of e-readers fail to be no larger than a mass market paperback, even the silly extra-tall ones.<p>An electronic copy, to me, does have <i>some</i> intrinsic value in that it's searchable, but that's primarily interesting for the bulky tech reference titles you allude to.<p>Everything else is delivery. I'm only willing to pay the full $8 price when I'm desperate, having nothing with me to read, but a local bookstore having something I know I'd buy eventually anyway. It's something I try to avoid by thinking ahead. Otherwise, for a brand new book, the Costco $6ish is my limit, and that's typically only for the more popular releases. Otherwise, it's $2-$5 at the used bookstore or online.<p>In contrast, perhaps since I'm not an avid game-player, or, perhaps because I read for pleasure 2-3 slower than I could, I find the price per enjoyment-hour to be one that makes some sense. This leads to a desire for a subscription model, since, after all, I can only read one book at a time. It would allow me to try out a writer without forking over my time <i>and</i> the cost of a whole book. Moreover, I'd be happy to pay several times as much for a 1k+ page Pynchon tome as for a pulpy novella or something in between[3].<p>If such a system were to pay royalties based on usage, I would expect it to encourage writing that's a balance between being so light as to be skimmable and so involved as to be inaccessible. I believe this to be a desirable consequence, though I recognize the danger in, if I may abuse the term, engineering regression toward the mean.<p>[1] This is on the order of $1 per item, in trade, at my local used bookstore.

Orkut, Sites, Knol, Chat, Wave, Scholar, etc. does not.<p>Some things like SketchUp are designed as loss leaders like Search to provide content to things that might have a decent revenue stream like Google Earth (except most of the paying users are probably not using the Sketchup Data).<p>But other, more expensive things like Chrome and Android have a link to making money that's very tenuous at best.<p>And we also already know that Search Ads account for 99% of Google's revenue stream.

Companies like the University of Phoenix exist to exploit this assumption.<p>Schools sell education plus connections plus guidance plus a diploma; the diploma is the most tangible thing they sell, so if you just sell the diploma you can cut your costs significantly. YC invests reputation and guidance and connections and money; someone who buys the same stake in exchange for nothing but money is obviously reducing the value--and valuation--of the company they buy into.<p>It's the entrepreneur's decision, and there are some good seed funding programs out there (Techstars has some great portfolio companies). But in many cases, the other programs are using seed companies' generally good reputation (thanks to YC) to make less valuable investments in the same group of companies.",1265058275
