It doesn't matter what gold costs right now if the USD experiences further free-fall, which is not out of the question.<p>This is generally the same reason there are buyers of sovereign debt (i.e. Treasury Notes) at a negative interest rate.<p>If the Eurozone collapses, as is more possible every day now, then that's a case in point for diversifying away from Euros. Some other choices in this <i>Great Recession</i> are USD, U.S. Treasury Notes, Japanese Yen, Swiss Francs, etc, none particularly attractive right now. The Chinese Yuan isn't a viable choice because it is pegged to the dollar.<p>[Edit:] The point is to deal with the current high risk of currency free-fall, <i>not</i> your normal everyday investment ebb and flow.",1266281904

Yes, the animations and scrollings are probably smoother - that's actually what I hate about Apple stuff. I don't care about fancy animations, I want to get things done. The smooth animations of Apple things just make me feel cheap, like a marketing whore. Not to say that Android isn't pretty, but I am guessing iPhone fans would have trouble adapting.<p>The Nexus is the first real mobile internet device I own - might be part of the excitement. But I am actually surprised how well everything works. I was expecting Android to remain in perpetual beta state, but it seems very usable to me.<p>I know I should be more excited about iPhone development, because of the huge money making opportunities. But I just can't. iPod and MacBook have been sitting on my desk for a year and I could not really get started. Getting a Nexus just made click and I feel enthusiastic about coding once again. Ever since I got it last week, I spent every spare minute on coding for it. Unfortunately I hate Java, but for the time being I try to see how far I can get with HTML+Javascript, otherwise, maybe some of the JVM languages can be made to run.",1266281858
