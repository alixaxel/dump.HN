It reminds me of George W. Bush asserting ""if we don't pass this bill, the whole sucker could go down"" or the member of Congress who claimed that if the 700 Billion dollar bailout was not passed, ""your ATM machine will not work Tuesday morning.""<p>Let's think through the worse case senario.  The Greek government defaults on it's debt, and a variety of people around the world discover that the Greek bonds they hold are worthless.  Some investors will have bought funds that are mixtures of all the EU country's debt, and those investors may dump those funds, thus making it expensive for the Dutch government to borrow money for a time - say, a year.   Exchange rates will also shift, but that always brings good with bad no matter which direction -- likely the Euro will drop, making it easier for other people to buy Dutch products, and helping Dutch exporters but making it more expensive for you to buy imports.<p>Perhaps you could take some advantage of the situation by being stingy and saving money, not buying imports, and instead buying high-yeild Dutch bonds, for a year or two.  But even if you didn't, by three to five years from now the difference in your personal wealth would be tiny.<p>A collapse of the market in Greek bonds does not break dikes or light fires in Holland.  No ""real"" wealth will be destroyed in your country.<p>Now let's consider what happens if you bail out the Greek government, and by extension, whatever unlucky stooges Goldman Sachs saddled with those bonds.   The Euro will see some inflation, dropping its value, but the effect is more long term than the ""collapse"" senario.  Goldman will hawk the bonds of Spain, Italy, Portugal, and any other shaky government as having an implicit backing of the hard work of the honest Dutch, and those goverments will borrow more because of it.<p>So I don't agree with your argument of ""comparitive hardship"" to 11 million Greeks vs. ""economic misery"" to 328 Europeans.<p>In some ways, this is just a preparation for what will happen in the US with the State of California, whose default will be larger than Greece's.  Is it in the best interests of the whole USA to assume the obligations that California undertook ?  If California defaulted on it's bonds, it would surely cause some financial turmoil and hardship, but it's not clear that financial turmoil and hardship would be avoided by guaranteeing their bonds.  Backing those bonds decreases the already shaky credit of the US as a whole.  On the other hand, states that need to borrow may not be able to for a period, and many retirement plans and pension funds will suddenly be shrunk.<p>I'm not in favor of either bailout.  The cost is a general undermining of the world financial system as a whole, and I don't think you will get the short term good effects that are hoped for.",1266290444

Warning, partial spoiler to the bogus solution included here.<p>-------------\n-------------<p>The solution proposes that for the first question, I turn to god A and ask ""Hey, A, if I were to ask you 'Are you Random', would you say 'ja'?""<p>Either A is Random or is not - we have those two cases to consider.  Let's consider the case where A is, in fact, Random - only I don't know it yet.<p>The problem, as stated, says that since A is Random, for each question posed to him, he ""mentally flips a coin"" and then answers as if he were Truth or as if he were Falsity.  So while we're considering the case that A is Random, we have two sub-cases to consider:  that he will answer as Truth or that he will answer as Falsity.  Let us consider the sub-case where A, although Random, will answer as Truth.<p>Finally, we have sub-sub-cases more:  perhaps 'ja' means ""yes"" or perhaps it means ""no"".  And so, we'll consider the sub-sub-case where 'ja' means ""yes"".<p>So A is Random, has chosen to answer my first question as Truth, and 'ya' means yes.   My question (in the bogus solution) is:<p>""Hey, A, if I were to ask (in your current mental state) 'Are you Random?' would you say 'yes'?""<p>God A (who is Random and who will answer this one question as Truth) reasons thusly.  He thinks to himself:<p>""If this guy had asked me 'Are you Random', since I have decided to tell Truth, I would answer 'yes' ('ja').'   However, that was <i>not</i> the question put before me - a different question was put before me.<p>Random (that's me, A) flips the coin once per question asked.   If he were to have asked 'Are you Random' that would have entailed a coin flip separate from the current coin flip.   That other coin flip could have gone either way and so, really, I might have answered 'yes' or 'no' ('ya' or 'da').<p>In other words, we made it clear to this guy that he was supposed to ask a simple yes or no question and instead he asked a question to which the only True answer would be 'dajadaja' [god-speak for 'maybe'].""<p>At that point, god A would produce from his sleeve the Magic Wand of Heyting (which was manufatured during the god-wars recorded in the book of RejectingTheLawOfTheExcludedMiddle) and smite me for failing to ask a yes/no question after being clearly instructed to do so.<p>In other words, with the proposed (bogus) answer, should A happen to be Random, and his coin come up Truth, and should 'ja' happen to mean 'yes' -- then I will go to my grave never knowing which god is which.   (Similar analysis probably applies to other sub-sub-cases.)<p>Very badly framed puzzle (but one that would be hard to frame soundly without giving away the intended answer).",1266289987
