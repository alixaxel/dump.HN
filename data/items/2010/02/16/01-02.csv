They're jockeying over last place in the SmartPhone modernity contest these days. Hasn't hurt them much yet but it's hard to see how that lasts forever. Nokia is probably in better shape than RIM here.<p>Palm: Good try. Consider Open Source and/or licensing before it's too late.<p>Apple: Probably not much to worry about for now but they shouldn't get complacent with the iPhone platform. My biggest question here is how big of a distraction the iPad was for Apple internally. Do we have a major iPhone revision and a strong software update in the works or another minor hardware bump with a merely evolutionary OS update? If they stay off Verizon for another year (at least) it could really start to hurt iPhone sales. The iPhone is no longer so far ahead of the pack that you'd suffer with bad coverage to use it.<p>Android: Not much for Google to worry about but I think a lot of third party handset makers will put some resources back into Windows Mobile devices. Even more so with the existence of the N1.",1266285591

I don't think this takes away from your argument -- it's just that I would suggest specifying whether your data point was arbitrary or carefully chosen to make your point. I think this would make your general argument stronger.<p>I think the most interesting, non-arbitrary comparison would be an investment starting in 1971, because this whole discussion is really about a fiat currency system versus gold, and how people value gold relative to such a system. 1971 is when the U.S. went completely off of Gold to a fiat system.<p>At the end of 1971, a few years after Gold started trading on open markets, the price was $41.25 an ounce [1]. Today, it is $1,100 an ounce [2]. That is a 26 fold increase.<p>At the end of 1971, the DJIA was $900 a share [3]. Today, it is $10,000 a share [3]. That is an 11 fold increase.<p>Gold outperformed our current dollar system, since its inception, by more than two fold.<p>That's not to mention the fact that you didn't have to do anything with Gold -- you just held it. With our dollar system, you'd be a fool to just hold the dollars themselves (because of inflation), so you are forced to speculate in the stock market or other risky vehicles.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.measuringworth.org/datasets/gold/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.measuringworth.org/datasets/gold/</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/gold.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/metals/precious/gold.html</a>\n[3]: <a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&q=INDEXDJX:DJI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&q=INDEXDJX:DJI</a>",1266285371

1128082,comment,1126878,1126878,0,0,pmiller2,,,"The problem certainly isn't that ""education"" is ruining peoples' lives.  It's that the way our schools are structured (with the exception of some private schools), they're almost certain to squeeze anything resembling creativity and free thought out of a child before he learns his multiplication tables.  One of the fundamental functions of schools seems to be to keep kids occupied, lined up in rows of desks, while their parents are at work.<p>I think the reason we could get away with this type of educational system in the industrial era is that factory work doesn't require a whole lot of knowledge or critical thinking skills.  For that matter, neither does low-level management at most companies (I'm thinking of the ""shop foreman"" or ""team leader"" type positions here).<p>Educating people for a knowledge economy is likely to be more labor-intensive than the 30+ student per teacher classrooms we see sometimes in public schools today.  So far, the best model I've seen that even comes close to educating children to be creative, critical thinkers without fundamentally denying what it means to be a child is the Montessori model.  Unfortunately, the Montessori model isn't a practical one upon which to base the entire country's education system right now, in no small part because there just aren't enough teachers to make it work.<p>I really wish I had the answer, but I don't.",1266284789

Long term I haven't noticed it being a big deal. Over time, if a question is relevant, good lower ranked answers will rise to the top even if faster, lower quality answers were voted up initially.<p>The worst case scenario is a question which is perfectly written such that it garners attention from experienced folks who know what they're talking about for only a tiny amount of time, and ever after only garners attention (via google searches, for example) from clueless noobs who can't judge the quality of the answers (and don't have the rep. on the site to vote answers up or down anyway). However, this is a pretty contrived scenario which doesn't play out often in real life. Important questions will garner attention by people with a range of experience and qualifications, which will have the side effect of improving the quality of answers over time through future voting etc.",1266282806

As early as the 70's a lot of bands started syncing to an electronic source. Especially the prog bands, with excellent drummers, who were versatile enough to sync at will to the arpeggiators on analog synths. And even those arpeggiators often had tempo drift due to the analog electronics.<p>I looked in the archive for this article -- an amazing collection of data by the way -- and found U2 tracks with tempo variations all over the map:<p><a href=""http://labs.echonest.com/click/?trackId=TRKYQTC123E85932E2&artist=U2&title=04+-+Bullet+The+Blue+Sky"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.echonest.com/click/?trackId=TRKYQTC123E85932E2&#...</a><p><a href=""http://labs.echonest.com/click/?trackId=TRZFYJM123E85816BE&artist=U2&title=13.+Pride"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.echonest.com/click/?trackId=TRZFYJM123E85816BE&#...</a><p>And then others, just a year or two earlier in their career, more ""machine""-like:<p><a href=""http://labs.echonest.com/click/?trackId=TRYMXDV123E8593F96&artist=U2&title=03.+Seconds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.echonest.com/click/?trackId=TRYMXDV123E8593F96&#...</a><p><a href=""http://labs.echonest.com/click/?trackId=TRJTTTN123E8593796&artist=U2&title=11+Sunday+Bloody+Sunday"" rel=""nofollow"">http://labs.echonest.com/click/?trackId=TRJTTTN123E8593796&#...</a><p>This project has created some amazing data, but I don't agree with all the conclusions at face value. Some of the stuff that is labeled as too machine-like, is well within the discipline of a lot of drummers. Meanwhile modern click tracks can be easily programmed to speed up and slow down throughout a track. In fact, it's done all the time.<p>EDIT: One other thing, some of the most interesting intentional tempo variations occur in the cycle of measures, phrases, and sections. The data presented here, only measured in seconds, doesn't track that relationship which would be the most musically interesting thing. It would be a good experiment to listen to some of these tracks with a prompt following the timeline in real time.",1266282666

The whole idea of getting VC money is to jumpstart the next phase of a company/product's life. Facebook was a college kid's side project that looked promising but VC money made it top 3 site on the web. YouTube would have been impossible for 3 typical 20-somethings to afford out of their personal/family savings. They needed VC funding because they were burning through $1m/month in cash. What exactly is it about Stack Overflow that Joel can't pay for himself with his own funds? What kind of hiring does he want to do to make it any bigger?<p>Joel listed all these vague reasons that sort of sound good without actually saying concrete steps / changes that would come out of VC funding. I would definitely like to hear what it is that he, despite being one of the most popular tech bloggers with a boatload of notoriety and savings, can't do with Stack Overflow that somehow VC money can.",1266282480
