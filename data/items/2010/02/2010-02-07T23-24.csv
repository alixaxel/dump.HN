1108519,comment,1108482,1108482,0,0,ghshephard,,,"Interesting - almost every single paragraph of this response is incorrect:<p><--
I would like to inform you that our website has a 128 bit encryption. With this base, passwords that comprise only of letters and alphabets create an algorithm that is difficult to crack. We discourage the use of special characters because hacking softwares can recognize them very easily.
--><p>I don't even need to dissect the ""hacking software can recognize them very easily"" in this forum.  They sound like they are suggesting reducing the possible keyspace is a _good_ thing.  It isn't.  It really, really isn't.<p><--
The length of the password is limited to 8 characters to reduce keyboard contact. Some softwares can decipher a password based on the information of “most common keys pressed”.
--><p>This one is just so wrong as to make it hard to understand what they are saying.  Ironically, _fewer_ keys, make it easier to guess based on the ""common keys pressed (4 character passwords on Intercoms are easily guess based on ""Wear"")<p><--
Therefore, lesser keys punched in a given frame of time lessen the possibility of the password being cracked.
--><p>Still making no sense.<p><--
Moreover, American Express is committed to protecting the privacy and security of all of our Cardmembers, both on-line and off-line. We believe that our current security measures, which include our sophisticated monitoring systems to detect unusual or fraudulent card activity, provide strong, ongoing protections for our Cardmembers.
--><p>Nothing to do with passwords, and, based on the previous sentences, doesn't really inspire faith on their Sophisticated Security.  I'm not saying amex doesn't have their act together, it's just not coming through in this email.<p><--
Rest assured, I have forwarded your comments to our webmaster for review. During this review, we may contact you if additional information is required.
--><p>Well, at least there is hope that the ""webmaster"" may come to their senses.",1265587048

Here's a great quote : ""advances in antibiotics (no more worries about what used to be called venereal disease)"" Are you kidding me? HERPES you can get it with a condom, genital warts and of course fucking AIDS and hepatitis? To the people talking about how this is unfortunate for women... if those women CHOOSE to fuck an asshole like tucker max, one of the biggest douches of the internet? They know exactly what they're getting into and there's no sense sympathizing with them if they let themselves get played in such an obvious way. That's not to say I'm a sexual prude - but I'm happily free of all STDs and any girl that sluts around with highly promiscuous guys like that needs to get tested before I get involved. There's absolutely nothing new about this either, rich attractive young males have been running their way through women since the dawn of time. How about putting aside all of these stupid gender roles and focusing our time on arranging a sane, happy and sustainable life? There's plenty of women and men that do this and don't obsess about knotches on a bedpost. Seriously after the first few hundred times how do you not start looking at the fact that you have limited time to find a super compatible person? Even without kids nobody wants to grow old and die alone and super compatibility is not easy to find. Enough ranting about this stupid ass article.",1265586265

Keeping this posted anyway :)<p>This is an application that I wrote for internal usage. Have you ever heard of TeuxDeux (<a href=""http://teuxdeux.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://teuxdeux.com/</a>)? Well, basically, I fell in love with the user-interface and it fulfilled that part of my needs. So, I took the look & feel and ran with it and made the following additions to my own version:<p>- Under the ""some day"" items I added categories which could be edited by dragging & dropping the category into the ""some day"" input box.<p>- Encouraged the usage of ""hash tags"" to TODO-items (#projectabbr Fix nasty crash bug)<p>- Added a filtering box which would highlight queried TODO's with that search filter<p>- Made it so that when you hover over a todo-item during drag/drop: a tree would pop-up with issues that depend on parent. You can drop the todo-item you are dragging and dropping into any of the items in that tree. When a parent is ""freed"" (done), its immediate children become separate TODO's in the list again. Rince/repeat.<p>- A detail screen which would appear when clicking on ""..."" next to a TODO item.<p>Put in mind here that I like the minimalistic and straight-to-the-point of this layout. I want my TODO lists to act like post-its :)<p>Unfortunately I have not open sourced it and I really never intended to do that for the very reason that I basically ""ripped off"" the look & feel of Teux Deux.

In hotels and restaurants, people will bend over backwards to help you. Everything they do is based around politeness. Everytime you walk into any kind of store you are greeted, whether a 7-11 or a high end hotel. But things are different. Your waiter doesn't come around to check on you until you specifically call for them. It's considered rude to bother the customer until they signal they need something. When at work or out socially, nearly every situation is governed by ""sempai"", which is who is senior among us. I went out drinking with 2 guys I met.

Outage Detection, Network Monitoring, Advanced Meter Reading.  We never even considered building any of these tools as thick apps - 100% Web Apps.  The Tools we use to manage the builds, file the defects, track customer requests, monitor networks - all Web Applications.<p>But -your point has merit when I look at the _number_ of applications I use - Around 25 in a given week (Terminal.App, Mail.App (Irony. :-), Colloquy, Adium, Excel, Visio, RemoteDesktop, FireFox, VMware, iTunes, VLC, CiscoVPN Client, Calc, Wireshark, etc...).<p>I guess, at the end of the day, the question is, what type of user are you - Those of us who are developers, SysAdmins, may be more likely to use a lot of thick clients, whereas people who have a limited number of tasks (Customer Service Representatives, Purely Administrative) may be be more likely to use Web Tools.<p>I make the argument about technology that ""will do"" - because I recognize that most people aren't you and I, they really just want to use their computer for a very limited set of tasks and move on.  But, your point about turning the tables is well made.  Overall, we should recommend the best tools for the job.<p>It's just that Web Applications, once built, are so easy to deploy across the enterprise.  It really is hard to build a decent application that can be (A) Rapidly Deployed to everyone, (B) Be maintained with patches on everyone's system, and (C) Be useful on Windows, OS X, and Linux, _unless_ you deploy it as a WebApp.  For some reason, Java Apps never really took off (I'm not sure if you consider Java Apps to be Web or Thick Client - I think they are in the middle.)<p>And, I agree with you in terms of where I get Value - at the end of the day, when I _really_ need to get some serious content creation or analysis done - It's Excel, Visio, and, interesting enough - my local shell.  I'm astonished how, 15 years into technology management, I use awk on 10 Gigabyte files to do critical work.   Definitely not a webapp.<p>So, I guess after reading your analysis, I probably agree with you more than I disagree.  In particular, ""html as a more advanced 3270 terminal"" brings it home for me.  The reality is, when I need more than just a terminal onto a back end application, I _do_ use a local thick client, and, I'm guessing that if most of the HN audience reviewed their work habits, they do as well.",1265584827

Most financial talk is about more common personal finance scenarios.
