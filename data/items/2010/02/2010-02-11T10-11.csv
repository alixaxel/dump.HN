Not the hype. Also can it be brought in otherwise and would it have become a sucess without YC. I would ask the same thing about veture capital. sure it feels good when someone hands you lots of $$$$ and say here work on your idea but I wouldn't take it if it's not going to be usefull or need. if you think about its kind of ironic because YC understands this and so gives only few dollars to start. it realy isn't needed at that stage but then neither is YC.<p>by the way if I had even 1% of google I'd be so rich :)",1265885815

It is based on a very selfish and static vision of a relationship : ""the other must think like me"", ""people never change"".
