Faster algorithms and faster programming-language implementations on web servers will do nothing whatsoever for this (and increasing the concurrent load of requests the web server can handle will in fact only overload the DB even more).<p>That's when you start doing caching, and that's why caching has such dramatic effects.<p>Once you've got your caching going nicely and your DB humming along, you will end up bandwidth bound. Not by your own pipe, but by clients; you may have a nice fat line running out of the data center, but your users may be on anything down to mobile phones or even dialup, and you'll only be able to push responses to them at the speed they can handle. This is the spoon-feeding problem, and once again algorithms and language implementations on the server can't do anything at all to help it.<p>That's when you start putting fast, light, highly-concurrent reverse proxies (nginx appears to be winning the market share battle) in front of your actual web servers, and once again you will see a drastic effect. Or you combine caching and proxy into one component and do Varnish.<p>Once you've done this, you might finally start to reach a point where you're genuinely I/O or CPU bound on a server that's actually running your application code. Or you might not; there are other roadblocks you might run into first.<p>At any rate, optimizing CPU usage is, for the vast majority of websites, a waste of time at least until you've been through the phases I've outlined above. And, generally, I think you'll find that's the advice (the ""myth"") you've been hearing: fiddling with programming languages and algorithms is literally a net loss of performance until you've dealt with quite a few other (and more important, performance-wise) things.",1265173901
