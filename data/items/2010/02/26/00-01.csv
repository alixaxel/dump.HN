We've got to the point where someone willing to accept a lowered standard of living can take lots of time off and use it to focus on other things that are important to them.  (The fact that people continue to toil to get more possessions just shows where their priorities lie).<p>Unfortunately there's always a small contingent who think that all this advancement is terrible and we'd be better off living the kind of ""simple but happy"" lives they condescendingly imagine people in the third world live.",1267145916

The Wii SDK is <i>much</i> cheaper (almost an order of magnitude) than either the Xbox or PS3 dev kits, the from what I can tell approval processes are far less onerous.<p>What has resulted? A deluge of <i>crap</i>. The amount of cheap shovelware games for the Wii boggles the mind, and dilutes the Wii brand significantly. It gets so bad that even non-gamer grandmas have noticed.<p>In comparison, Sony and MS are riding high, they have a gigantic amount of 3rd party support, people are willing to pay their ticket price for entry to the platform, and willing to put up with a lot more content restrictions (e.g., no free DLC, extensive multiplay/connectivity requirements even for singleplayer games)<p>There's a fine line to be walked here, and I'm not sure if Android has the model right either.",1267145710

1152048,comment,1151886,1151886,0,0,megaduck,,,"Every time I read one of these stories, I think of Nintendo in the 1980s and 90s.  Back then, Nintendo was the undisputed king of video games with an install base of over 60 million NES consoles.  They had a trusted brand, a massive library of titles, and money coming in hand-over-fist.  They even managed to keep that success rolling, and the SNES was the top console through the early 90s.<p>Developers <i>hated</i> doing business with Nintendo.  Nintendo put every game through a rigorous review process, and stripped out anything that they found objectionable.  This castrated a lot of games like Mortal Kombat and Final Fight, and ensured that some titles never came to market at all.<p>Nintendo also charged a licensing fee, and ensured that only licensed games could be played.  In order to distribute games, publishers had to buy the cartridges from Nintendo at pretty hefty prices.<p>This system worked great until Sony came along, and told publishers that they'd cut a better deal.  Much more relaxed terms, and a far fewer restrictions on content.  Suddenly, developers migrated en masse to the Playstation.  Square became Sony-only.  Capcom suddenly concentrated on Playstation games like Metal Gear Solid. All of a sudden, all the big new games were Playstation exclusives, and the only big games for N64 were Nintendo's own first-party titles.  At the time, it felt like a switch had been flipped.<p>I feel a similar dynamic starting to play out with the App Store and Android.  History seldom repeats itself, but it tends to rhyme.",1267145250

How about a cable box? Is the software in your coffee maker open source? How about the bios in your PC?</i><p>I do not use any programmable devices with proprietary software.  I don't have an iPhone, I don't have cable, and I don't have a coffee maker. (I do make coffee, but it consists of pouring boiling water on top of coffee grinds.  No computer needed!) I do use the closed-source nVidia driver, but only because I can't buy an Intel-based card for my desktop.  The GSM chip on my mobile phone also runs proprietary software, but only because the government won't allow one with open-source software to be sold in the US.

The standard doors they are using aren't wide enough. No, not even for a manual chair.  You could maybe retrofit the specialty hinges so that the door opens wider (outside of the frame), but that only works for some manual chairs, depending on their width. I need at (at minimum) 24"" to get through a vestibule.<p>2. If they are using any sort of flooring, it won't support the weight of a power wheelchair.<p>3. It would be impossible to not feel like you're going to back into or damage a wall - they don't have any turn radius inside.<p>4. Even small steps are a pain in the butt. No, ramping it doesn't always help.<p>5. Once they're in the open warehouse space, and have little 'hallways', the doors will open out into the hall, making it hard to navigate around.<p>6. If you manage to get more than one person inside of the wheelchair user's own house, it will be a tight fit to get anyone else in there, plus a desk, plus a small chair.<p>And this is just for wheelies.<p>Being as how this is one of those careers folks with differing abilities are able to do well, it would be a good idea to consult with universal design principles before going any further. On top of that, considering your business model, you may want it to be friendly to anyone you'd like to rope in as a client. Your clients might be chair users.<p>Having said that...<p>I think it's a creative and fantastic idea. I think it's a fun way to personalize the office on a much smaller budget than, say, Google.

If we can get setup of that (or something similar) to be as painless as setting up a facebook account and friending, we might be on to something.<p>I also want to use it for things like storing scanned images and possibly home automation/monitoring.<p>In short there might be a market niche for a low-power headless server to solve this kind of situation<p>*<a href=""http://www.openplug.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openplug.org/</a>",1267142551

Less money wasted on competition, easier ways for patients to get a specialists opinion if needed, cheaper access to supply, more efficient use of dental technicians / staff in general.<p>I guess the scale of centralization is the real question.",1267142475
