For example, a semantic analysis engine that accepts a URL and returns the extracted meaning from a web page.  Input several bytes.  Output less than a k.  I think this is totally feasible and worth it as long as customers can monetize the output.  To me a service like OpenCalais is AaaS.  Sure they have software but the hard part of what they do is semantic analysis.",1266634750

The code quality in b2 was about what you'd expect given wordpress' initial security reputation.<p>I find it particularly interesting because you'd expect OSS that will be picked up by others to have good code quality though. Add to that the fact that at the time your typical PHP user probably had more technical competence than most (webhosting, particularly supporting PHP was rarer then)",1266634737
