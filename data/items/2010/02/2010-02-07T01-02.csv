Now, the usual caveats apply, Denver might make significantly more yards per carry, for example. But, nevertheless, this graph clearly shows that Pittsburgh had more rushing plays.""<p>What constitutes a commit varies between organizations. More than that, look at the area under the respective graphs. Apple has already made a HUGE number of commits. Presumably they've achieved many of their strategic aims. Google has barely scratched the surface, if we're to believe that raw commit numbers matter at all.<p>Apple's trend line is going down. Should I infer from that that Apple no longer cares about Webkit?<p>Apple doesn't commit to Webkit as a public service. They also don't commit as a race against Google. They'll commit precisely as needed to achieve their business goals. There is nothing interesting implied by the relative numbers of commits between Apple and Google.",1265507676

There's no software priced between $1000 and $75,000. I'll tell you why. The minute you charge more than $1000 you need to get serious corporate signoffs. You need a line item in their budget. You need purchasing managers and CEO approval and competitive bids and paperwork. So you need to send a salesperson out to the customer to do PowerPoint, with his airfare, golf course memberships, and $19.95 porn movies at the Ritz Carlton.</i><p>In other words, there's a natural price delta between end-user software and ""enterprise,"" or whatever you want to call it, software.

1107083,comment,1106635,1106779,0,0,nagrom,,,"I don't believe that Maths or Physics can really be taught using the traditional lecture format. The lecture may suffice to run through the techniques of various proofs, or tell the student what he/she needs to learn. The only way  really to learn these technical subjects is to sit down with a pencil and paper and do it through. The same is true for Computing Science. Until you run through the examples and derive/write things for yourself, you'll never truly understand them, regardless of the format of a lecture, or the capability of the teacher.<p>For what it's worth, I have a degree in Maths, a PhD in Physics and I am develop software for research purposes, when I don't teach - so I have some experience.<p>The best way for a student to learn these hard technical subjects is for them to sit with their colleagues and go through group exercises, alongside a lot of hard individual work. The teacher's job is merely to help them over the hurdles they have difficulty with, and to show them the things that are truly worth learning. Although I never went through it myself, I suspect that the Oxbridge system of having indiviual tutoring sessions in small groups as the basis of the teaching is probably perfect for these purposes.",1265507506
1107082,comment,1104806,1105556,0,0,jellicle,,,"Quoting Wikipedia for legal matters is better than nothing, I suppose, but hardly decisive.  In this case, Wikipedia is wrong, as I have noted: many courts have found copyright infringement without any proof at all being presented that anything was copied.  With the facts given - two individuals creating by pure coincidence a story that is nearly identical - whoever published it first is going to win the court case, and the court will presume that the other party copied it, even if no one testifies that they saw the other party reading, editing, and copying from the first story.<p>If you by pure chance happen to have a music file on your hard drive that decodes to play ""Thriller"" by Michael Jackson, and you claim that you created it independently and have never heard of the song before, I assure you the court will rule against you and the music publisher will not be required to submit any proof that you copied it from, say, a CD of Jackson songs.<p>The ""copy"" in copyright is NOT copying the other person's work.  It's producing the copy you made.  So in the story example, the second person's published story is the infringing copy,  ""Copying"" from the first story is not the copying that is covered by copyright; it's the creation of items that appear to be copies.<p>Wikipedia is simply wrong here and it's kind of sad that HN is so ignorant about copyright law.",1265507419

For example, no matter what was printed in the NY Times it was perceived as obviously skewed as being either wildly pro-israel or wildly pro-palestinian... depending on the affiliations of the people reading it.  Literally the same article.<p>The idea that everyone deeply believes that media (or other people/organizations etc) are deeply skewed/biased, yet the nature of the perceived bias varies in _opposite_ ways depending on their personal beliefs, is kind of depressing.<p>The meta-theme I sort of got from that class was that social psychologists like Dr. Ross genuinely got into the field wanting to change the world and help people to end wars etc. through applied social science.  However, the more research they did, and the more they really understood the deep, deep psychological factors driving things like conflict in the middle east, the more they realized that this is a lot harder than they could have ever imagined.

True, it is not a complete and unambiguous debunking in that there still exists some slight bit of wiggle room, but that's not my point at all-- if the author had really cared about representing the subject matter in a way that reflects reality, she would have made a much weaker claim, or at the very least, she would have acknowledged how incredibly poorly supported her claim really was.<p>As for political pressure in climate research, well, that's a rather extraordinary claim, given that there has been documented rather a lot of political pressure in the opposite direction, such as the governor of the state of Alaska telling the researchers at the largest university in the state that they needed to work to prove environmentalists wrong. No doubt one can always find small and local examples of individual PIs acting inappropriately-- that happens in all fields-- but to show that there is widespread political pressure to produce positive AGW studies would take quite a bit of evidence. To me, this argument holds about as much water as the creationist argument that they're being censored.
