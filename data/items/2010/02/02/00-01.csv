Could be very low-tech too - just IM/email and some FrieNDAs.<p>I'd like to share two techniques I've found somewhat helpful (though not quite the ultimate answer, unfortunately).<p>1. While side projects often have no deadlines and thus less motivation, employees don't really have the same problems. I've delegated more components from side projects to my employees and the result is things getting done much faster. Now the progress block is things that are back in my hands - writing content, taking a working product and launching it for people to try.<p>2. A while back, an entrepreneur-type I know over the net and I did an experiment. We would both work all day and struggle with motivation to complete site-projects during the evening so we decided we'd each complete a small site project in one week. Each morning, we'd check in to show our progress. Failure to show progress meant the other person was to apply guilt trips were appropriate. Monday night as planning, Tuesday was fleshing out content, Wednesday was a skeletal site, Thursday was putting things together, Friday was polishing and making it live. Each night, the pressure of thinking you'd have nothing to show the following morning was enough to force productivity. On nights when I'd normally laze around or procrastinate at the desk, I'd cram 1-2 hours of work around or after midnight. It was enough to get a basic site rolling by the Friday that I would never have otherwise done. It worked for me but unfortunately the other guy didn't get going quite as well. Still, I'd do it again.",1265072013

If you are hired somewhere because of affirmative action legislation, this does not equate to Congress or your employer saying ""you are a moron, have a cookie"". Whether you agree with it or not, the purpose of affirmative legislation is to statistically address socially-derived shortcomings in the performance of a minority by temporarily stacking the deck in their favour. This is commonly misunderstood by some people, who think the purpose of affirmative action is to benefit a particular individual.<p>So for example, causing a person from a racial minority to be admitted to college by enacting racial admission quotas is not intended to help that particular person; it is because the largest determinant factor in whether somebody will gain college admission is a college educated parent. So in this case, you are stacking the decks for a group of people now so that you won't have a disparity in the next generation.  In other words, even if you have benefited from affirmative action, it was not done for your personal sake. It was done for reasons of social engineering.<p>It's a complicated issue, and I doubt HN is the place for it.",1265069259
