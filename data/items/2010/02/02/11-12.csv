[...] However, Django simply does not work at the level of abstraction that would allow multiple output languages.</i><p>The Django people have always been quite up-front about their goal of providing a full-stack framework with all basic components included and tested rather than an all-singing, all-dancing, pluggable and composable architecture. I can't say what they've come up with is to my personal tastes but it's a perfectly reasonable design choice. ""What real world problems would such a change solve"" is a similarly reasonable and pragmatic question. ""Tough. Django produces XHTML"" makes them sound like bigger jerks than they probably are!",1265111990

I was referring to the people who get very little done.<p>Other companies would love to hire only Google caliber employees but there isn't enough people to hire.  So you end up with a company that may have a few superstars and a lot of average programmers.  If a superstar slacked off they would have the same productivity as the average coders.  It is hard for a manager to complain to that superstar when his productivity is just as good as many of his peers.  At Google the slacker would stand out because his peers are all superstars and get A LOT done.",1265111828

With a double course load and a full time job coming up this semester, I knew I was going to be in trouble if I kept up the pace I had. In contrast to what many others say, I don't think cold turkey is necessary, but you do need some outside assistance - going at it by willpower alone is hard. I asked my girlfriend to set up the 'parental controls' functionality and set a hard limit of 4 hours a week. When your game time is up, you get kicked out. Clock is reset on Sunday night, so Monday evening is usually my game night, rest of the week I just check wow.com sometimes or do some occasional research on gear. You'll never get far in the game at this rate but if you get someone to check your gaming habits it's very doable to keep control over it.",1265111423

There are no shortcuts.""<p>Makes sense; a 'solid grasp' is like a solid algorithm: it's not solid until it can handle anything you can throw at it.<p>But the amount of time 'expertise' requires can vary a lot. Mozart had the technical expertise in music to write a fairly decent fifth symphony when he was nine. Beethoven's first symphony (technically superior, <i>emotionally</i> much superior) came when he was forty.<p>So it seems a good idea to distinguish -technical- expertise from -mature- expertise (much more familiar with all the special cases and anomalies).

Frequently.<p>It would have been a bad example for the above post, though, because people actually opposed Japan's conduct in Manchuria <i>contemporaneously</i> (whereas China's conduct in the status quo, the Soviet Union's conduct for its entire existence, and the first few years of German fascism were/are dealt with limp-wristedly when they were not actively applauded).<p>For example, the United States hit Japan with a steel/oil embargo after Japanese refused to withdraw from Manchuria, which was the proximate cause of Japan deciding to go to war with the United States.  (Funny little historical note: the US didn't actually intend the embargo to be a total embargo.  When it was conceived in Washington it was as a temporary cutback to force Japan to the negotiating table.  A minor bureaucrat misfiled something, though, and the planned periodic review never happened, which turned it into a total embargo.  ""Whoops."")<p>As an aside, essentially none of Japan's present economic prosperity is owed to wealth stolen from China.  Most of that got very comprehensively burned, along with the rest of the country.  Japan was pretty desperately poor postwar prior to the US' Korean war buildup, which they largely sourced in Japan, re-laying the industrial base which ignited the Period of High Economic Growth (高度成長期) that brought Japan from ""substantially poorer than Mexico"" to ""really freaking rich"".<p>Apologies for the lecture.",1265108978
