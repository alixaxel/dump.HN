However the employee actually has a couple of choices at this point... either they can have a lot of free time, start a startup, go snowboarding, etc, or they can go to their manager and negotiate. From what I've heard, both of these actually occur.<p>Another interesting trend is that employees tweak what they're doing and start working more efficiently, increasing a teams output by as much as 35% without working ""more"".<p>> <i>[it] could be costly if you have an unmotivated group doing it for the paycheck</i><p>It would appear that lack of motivation shows up in lack of results and the unmotivated group quickly has to find another job. In one case, a company fired nearly 90% of a particular department, but the retention rate sky rocketed, so their costs went way down, even when you include the cost of having to look for and hire new people.",1266548305

There was no other way I was going to be able to attend MIT, a dream I'd had since I was about 8 years old and saw a PBS special about the 2.70 design contest.<p>Sure, some people take loans and don't spend the money wisely (fail to graduate, choose an expensive school for a very low paying career, max out their loans and gamble or fritter it away). Those are all personal choices and I don't have a problem with those people suffering the consequences in exchange for what I perceive to be the greater good: that a motivated kid from middle or lower income family (such as I was) is able to attend MIT, thrive there, and as a result go on to have a substantially more fulfilling life. Oh and by the way, as part of that life, you'll have to pay back that money that someone fronted you when you were penniless, unemployable outside a mall context, no credit history, no significant employment history, etc.<p>Taking that opportunity away from all such kids, in exchange for having no one be able to make a poor choice specifically around student loans, is not a good trade, IMO.",1266545007
