1100203,comment,1099591,1099591,0,0,transmit101,,,"Ok. I've lived in England all my life. Let's highlight a few facts:<p>* Planning laws in the UK exist largely to protect the countryside from being over-developed by often powerful building firms.<p>* Surrey (the county where this man built is castle), being directly south of London, is one of the most difficult and expensive areas to buy (or build) property.<p>* The English countryside is under threat, especially in the south-east of the country where urban growth is a constant threat to communities.<p>* Planning laws are well known and understood here. This man tried to circumvent them at every opportunity, for his own benefit, and got caught out. Big time.<p>You can argue that this is only one little castle, or that it shouldn't apply to individuals, or whatever, but the fact is that the laws exist and (generally) do a good job at making sure that the beautiful countryside doesn't turn into an over-developed shit-hole.<p>I understand the reasons these laws exist. There's no reason at all to call them out for being either over-bureaucratic, or an example of the over-arching state. They exist for a reason, basically the good of the wider community, and this guy tried to circumvent them for his own selfish (presumably financial) benefit.<p>I've absolutely no sympathy for him at all.",1265276808

1100178,comment,1099811,1100041,0,0,patio11,,,"When you say ""micropayments"", were you thinking $5 ~ $10 or $0.05?  I see this as being able to provide low-value payments to a clientele that can't normally access them.  It fixes the major problem they have: inability to credibly demonstrate willingness and ability to pay within the constraints of an online interaction.  Banked people can do this fairly easily: punch in credit card details.<p>(Well, technically, it really fixes the merchant's problem with that user more than the user's problem -- which is one potential stumbling block in user adoption.)<p>This doesn't alleviate the problem with nickel/dime scale micropayments, which is that users hate them with a passion unmatched by a thousand burning suns.  That was true back when Clay Shirkey mentioned it in 2000 and is true today.  The mental transaction cost makes every single microtransaction a significant barrier to conversion.<p>This is one reason aside from credit card fees why people who do micropayments successfully tend to use a dual currency model where the micropayment currency (bought for cash money) is as easy to spend as the currency which you can earn from ingame actions.  (i.e. one-click no auth no confirm purchases, like buying something from the vendor in WoW.)",1265275552
