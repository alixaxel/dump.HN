1148076,comment,1147797,1147941,0,0,apinstein,,,"He is promoting progressive taxation as an enabler of social justice, not individual justice. There's a difference.<p>He acknowledges your point that the debate on <i>flat vs progressive tax</i> rates is a <i>virtue vs social justice</i> debate.<p>He also is debunking the idea that higher taxes hurt the economy, which is the <i>OMG BE SCARED</i> argument that the right uses to try to lower taxes (without a commensurate reduction in spending) in order to grow the economy and (eventually) increase the tax base. I recently wrote a similar article about this particular point (<a href=""http://www.reasonablyopinionated.com/2010/02/tax-revenues-tax-cuts-and-gdp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reasonablyopinionated.com/2010/02/tax-revenues-ta...</a>) because the only thing that ever happens in modern history when taxes are lowered is horrible deficits. As the Slate article points out, there isn't a strong correlation between tax rates and GDP growth.<p>Personally I am on the side of Buffet and Spitzer on this issue and do support progressive taxation, precisely because of the social justice argument. I believe in equal opportunity, but abhor the idea of forcing equal outcomes.<p>What really irks me about the anti-progressive-tax crowd is how they don't even acknowledge the benefits the rich get from such a system: efficient and reliable infrastructure, political stability, and a large middle class (ie customer base). If the government did not make those investments, the overall pie would likely be smaller.",1267023034

Instead of running a ton of advertising to drive traffic to the phones or website, I opened a store front in an 800 sqft unit attached to the front of the local Best Buy.  I did my selling in person, and used some unique branding to help people remember us.  This worked because a) dialup ISPs sold to a localized area, and b) the newness of the Internet scared people.  I lost count of how many computers passed through our doors getting configured correctly for access.<p>In a pure online play, I think the equivalent of location is channel strategy.

Having yet another device that needs power to work means setting up yet another place for it to charge.  Granted, books need more storage space, so this is balanced.<p>2. Very limiting.  I have numerous technology books, and often I'm flipping back and forth between two or three.  I don't see being able to do this with a single device.<p>3. It's a single purpose device.  I already have too many devices alread (iPod and Phone), and I find that too much still.  Couple that ear phones, keys, and a wallet, it's far too much stuff I need to carry around.  An e-book reader would be just one more thing I'd need to carry around.<p>4. Lending capabilities is non-existent.  Unless the person also has an e-book reader (and here I'm making the assumption that I can even lend the book from device to device), they can't be lent the book.  I've done this enough that it's actually rather important.<p>5. Going beyond the lending problem, I'm not alone, and my family might want to read something as well.  Current e-book readers mean needing one for every person.  Throw DRM concerns on top of that, and I don't know how it could be handled.  If I want to read one book, and my wife another book, and we have only one e-book reader...<p>6. Cost.  While an individual device isn't that expensive, you still have to buy a lot of books to make up for the difference in price.  Even if you read a lot like me, not all my reading is done with books.  I'm a big Audible fan, so this cuts into my time as well.  But still, the device is expensive, usability is still awkward.<p>Side note: I've tried out Sony's e-book readers, and maybe it's just the floor models, but they seem awful, cumbersome, and something I would expect to see as an early alpha.  Buttons are slow to react, touch-screen is finicky, and whats with the ugly flashing black screen every time it changes pages?  God help me if I want to scroll to a certain page.  End note.<p>Obviously both MS and Apple, amongst other manufacturers, see the potential with the tablet like devices.  The magic device will solve the 'hard to read for long periods' problem, as well as the cost problem.  Oddly enough, I constantly think of Star Trek and their pads they carry around.  They have a lot of them, and treat them rather roughly.  That's the direction I think people need to take, using those 'data pads' as a reference for how they could be used.<p>For some reason, I think Microsoft will get there first.",1267022063
