This all works technically well, and suits the target - my friends all have a GMail account and are willing to avoid creating a new login/pass if possible.<p>One of the drawbacks though is that login out from the site doesn't log you out from Google OpenId (as there's no such thing as single sign out currently in OpenId, if I'm right).<p>As such, if you click on ""login"" right after clicking on ""logout"", you'll be in, without any apparent check. So the log-out feature is essentially broken per se.<p>I understand that it's not really the current scope of OpenId etc, but I'd really love to get some feedback from people who may have found work-arounds to still rely on OpenId or Google accounts, more specifically.<p>My current work-around is to display a yellow warning after people log out, stating that they need to logout from gmail, and providing them with a link to do that.<p>What do you think?",1265705734

1111804,comment,1111711,1111711,0,0,patio11,,,"Psst: internal dashboard to track the number of stamps which non-paying users used this month won't take you five minutes to implement.  It is a single SQL query, right?  I know you'll have to discard a working Excel system to do it but from the moment you're done to the moment you die you will never have to update that Excel file again.  Process efficiency!  You can crank out as many of these little micro-things as you want and put them in a single dashboard, which will give you a quick health check at a glance, minimize time spent bookkeeping, and make you not waste too much time digging into reports when you could be working.  OK, tangent over.<p>There is nothing wrong with giving people free things that actually cost money, as long as your COCA (cost of customer acquisition) is substantially lower than your LTV (lifetime customer value).  It is no different, conceptually speaking, from doing something like paying from AdWords for a user who might convert into the trial but never into a paying user.  I'll probably pay Google close to $1,000 this month for that: this is safe because I have historical data and a failsafe (discussed later).<p>It has also been my experience that most users go up-or-out very quickly on my service.  If that continues to be true for you, you have very little to worry about.<p>If you speak to an accountant, who are generally conservative types, they will recommend you to do something to cap your maximum liability via this.  For example, you can clarify that unused free stamps expire at the end of the month.  (That might already be the policy.  If so, smart.)  You could also reserve the right to yank that offer at any time.  I'm not a lawyer, but I think that is likely to be as simple as merely yanking the offer at any time.<p>I'd put a failsafe in the system to prevent you from spending over $X on free stamps in a day, for reasons similar to why Google only has authorization to charge me $X in a day: if the process goes suddenly out of control, have a human think things through before saying ""Oh, sure, 1500% growth is totally normal under these circumstances.  Spending approved!""  It might happen because you ended up featured on the front page of the NYT.  Congratulations.  It also might happen because you ended up on 4Chan when some enterprising individual suggests using your service to send a million pictures of genitalia to some public figure who has made statements they do not approve of.",1265705159

background:
I'm in my mid 20,single, located in Japan and working for the-so-called high-tech corp that i don't really proud of, but I like my job. very smart people, agile, warm, and funny. I have huge passion in start-up, have an experience in working at one, and enjoyed the culture very much. on the other hand, i need job security, especially at this economic time.
My close friend is trying to build his second start-up company and he needs someone like me...<p>the offer:<p>1. 45%~ equity, although i haven't talk much with him about the details<p>2. I'll be paid by salary, albeit a very low one<p>3. regardless my job title, I'll be managing most of the business and technical stuff. He'll just managing his first company and be the CEO figure for this new one.<p>4. there're already clients ready to do business with us.<p>5. I like the technology and business challenges he showed me, and i think i can build a product for him.<p>the problems:<p>1. by family tradition i ""need"" to get married fast... like before 30. committing to something like this will take most of my time. I'm sure I can handle the load, but I'm not sure my non-existent-yet SO can...<p>2. My friends first start-up isn't very successful one. It works, lives, profitable to employing 20~ more in 4 countries, but it is a stagnant/saturated market, the new company also in similar market with different products. I have worked in start-up in similar field which is more successful.Um, what I'm trying to say is that he is not the typical leader who you would idol, he is more likely happen to be there when opportunities come. there're many inefficiencies in how he manages people, resources, how he behave as a leader in general. I suspect this will be a problem when I want to change something the way company works etc.<p>3. he is my close friend, and I'm afraid doing this business with him will ruin our relationship when everything goes down.<p>4. I'll likely to loose market-level salary, perks, housing benefits, and going back to ramen life, which is kind of suck but okay... the biggest problem is job security, again my culture(?) and family will stand against my decision<p>okay, I'm not sure why i post this here, but what i see that this community has lots of experience that I know nothing of. Based on your experience and my details above, what can you suggest me?",1265704870

Many will end up having to do at least some simple form of it in their future lives, anyway; certainly people in the natural sciences do, and increasingly lots of other people will find themselves needing to write an Excel macro, or sort some data with a Perl script, and various other such things.<p>I agree current CS 101 classes aren't good at conveying that excitement though, of being able to make a computer do what you want. The linked article talks about media computation as one approach to that: instead of having people sort lists or whatever, show them that they can make simple art stuff.
