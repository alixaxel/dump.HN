People with smartphones wont want to use a site that is so stripped down it would work well on a crappy handset.<p>We are sitting on the edge of a large explosion of smartphone devices and (potentially) users (with <i>lots</i> of Android handsets coming out this year). In the UK you can now get a Android powered device for £20 / month with a free handset. If you <i>want</i> a smartphone (and therefore probably interested in using the web), you will be able to afford one this year (at least in Europe!). This is going to be huge.<p>The iPhone is the standard they all will judge themselves against, and therefore the iPhone is the <i>benchmark</i> device.<p>I would suspect that the 50% smartphone / 50% other phone traffic statistic will be <i>way</i> higher towards smartphones in 12 months time.",1265716764

As a serious bike geek, there's nothing I couldn't find at one of the better-stocked dealers, some of whom will provide very rich and specific data. I've spend stupid amounts of money on bikes, but they've all been carbon-framed, drop-handlebarred, with 20 gears, rendering your advanced search not nearly advanced enough.<p>Your tool could be incredibly powerful and useful for me if your database held information on weight, allowing me to shop on a dollars-per-gram basis. Comparison shopping features would be very useful and provide you with a substantial revenue stream in the form of affiliate fees. A database of parts and a wish list would allow me to configure a home-built bike or an upgrade.<p>If I were a casual cyclist, I can't see your site making me any less confused than the front page of the first cycle dealer I pick out of Google. If I found my perfect bike I'd still need to Google for a dealer that stocked it and potentially get tripped up by different model years, different specs etc. I don't really know what any of these terms mean, how many gears I would want or which material I want my bike made out of - I just know that I want a nice light bike for buzzing around town, or something plush and comfortable for pedalling round the park, or something that will carry my shopping. I see the mouseover popups that explain some of the terms, but they don't clarify things all that much and it seems like I'm stumbling around at random.<p>As it stands, I just don't know why I'd use your tool instead of going straight to a bike retailer. Your stem calculator is useful because it provides information I can't really find anywhere else. The rest of the site feels like you've built it because you can. I can't see the problem that you're trying to solve.",1265716350

1111995,comment,1094902,1094902,0,0,sedachv,,,"Bad corner of the Lisp world? Socket libraries are the Skid Row of Common Lisp.<p>The reason it's hard to create a good library comes from an interplay of 3 things: streams, lack of standard character representation, and lack of standard foreign function interfaces. The latter two are sort of advantages in that if they were standardized in 1989 or whatever, we would probably have wound up with something stupid involving DOS code pages and Fortran on VMS.<p>Streams are convenient and most CL functions expect them. They're also a really inefficient way of using BSD sockets. Especially when your Lisp implementation's character encoding isn't UTF-8. So if you want to write fast network code in Lisp you basically need to use the raw POSIX FFI functions and byte arrays.<p>Then you get into fun stuff like vectored I/O (which you may or may not be able to do depending on whether your GC moves arrays around), and event-based I/O (which people disagree as to how to do properly). But it's ok, because none of the existing socket libraries try to support this anyway, so you're back to calling POSIX functions via FFI.<p>(I gave a presentation about this stuff last year: <a href=""http://carcaddar.blogspot.com/2009/11/november-montreal-schemelisp-user-group.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://carcaddar.blogspot.com/2009/11/november-montreal-sche...</a>)<p>If your socket library is dependent on any third-party libraries, pray that the latest versions will not completely change their interface and make your library fail to compile. Then multiply all this by the half-dozen or so Common Lisp implementations people expect to be supported.<p>Just like Skid Row, this has been a recognized problem for many years (well over a decade for certain), and it's kind of hard to make it better. Flexi-streams over usocket is the best off-the-shelf solution, so you're probably doing the right thing.",1265716222

1111993,comment,1111939,1111939,0,0,mwexler,,,"Unclear if this is aimed at bike experts or bike newbies.  Is this to help me find a bike?  Then help me understand WHY the data points are important.   Even your front search frame dropdown: alum vs. steel?  I don't know, why should I pick one?  This assumes I already know the reasons why these filters are important.<p>The data dump for each bike is nice, but again, no context, no comparison feature, nothing to let me know why each data point matters.<p>If you are going for an expert audience, then consider expert tools:  experts all already have a bike, so they want to consider upgrades and alternative bikes for alternative uses.  So why not allow users to search that way: Given that I have a, say, Trek 7.2 FX, what's the next logical upgrade level/search features from that?  It would be differerent and new, afaik.<p>So, it's a fine data aggregator, but I would love to see some smarts via a more bike-thinking way to search, and a more useful display of the data which allows me to know that some frame angles are ""race ready"" and cause you to lean down while riding, or that some frame types are better for vibration but may not be necessary if you ride short distances on pavement, etc.   That context can also be provided via on screen comparisons: 1 variable across 10 bikes, or comparing 2 bikes across all variables.<p>I agree with danteembermage around community features; these days, it's hard to get far without them, either built in or by allying yourself with an existing community.",1265716015

Show don't tell. Maybe a ""popular"" gallery or a ""best deals"" gallery etc. Filling out that form takes way too much effort for the ""unsold"".<p>Lastly I was pretty sad to find no pictures of any bikes whatsoever!

So maybe just kill two birds with one stone and focus on getting juicy pictures of badass bikes in a nicely laid out gallery. I actually don't know much about bikes, but would like to, so I'll be rooting your site on.<p>HTH",1265715694
