The question is how to you harness the former and limit the latter.  We seem to do a <i>very</i> good job with both when compared to the rest of the world.<p>In terms of the bottom lines of economic growth, standards of living and employment, again, we do much better than the rest of the world (I'm not going to count the special case of China emerging from decades of communism, returning a billion plus people to the world market is a one time thing ... and their recent grow should be weighted against how much they lost economically during the previous period).",1266929968

But speed learning is, I think, really hard to <i>develop</i> if your not natural at it.<p>Im a natural speed learner and always have been; <i>but this comes with some serious side effects too</i>.<p>My rote learning is pretty poor and I sometimes pass over minutiae. Also while I can quickly learn a topic and sound fairly expert I tend to struggle to fill out the rest of the detail: as a result I know a <i>lot of stuff</i> - but much is in no real depth (that's only partly problematic now; in my fields of interest I have developed the deep knowledge but it was not easy).<p>Focus is a problem too. I cant concentrate on learning anything for long periods. And hour at most - and if it isnt gone in by then I will move on. A couple of physics text books I bought months ago are still sat on my desk 50% finished because I lost interest in the ending.<p>These are <i>not</i> techniques you should really try to employ to pass exams. I can do it because it's a natural process for me (scan text books for a few hrs before exam etc.) but friends that have tried the same (and are natural rote learners) struggled to connect information together in the exam.<p>And a fun anecdote: one of my best final year university exam results was in a class I ignored after the first lecture (Opto electronics, my god it was boring). I skimmed the text book the morning of the exam with a friend and he suggested we go grab a drink because <i>""we really need to go to an exam drunk at least once. and as were going to fail this anyway....""</i>. 4 pints and another skim read later we both aced the exam (top marks of the year).
