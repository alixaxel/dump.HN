Because of its unprecedented and escalating amounts, it is a major constraint ... binding individuals for a significant part of their future work lives. Although it has more varied application, less direct effects, and less severe conditions than colonial indenture did...and it does not bind one to a particular job, student debt permeates everyday experience with concern over the monthly chit and encumbers job and life choices. ... [Lenders subsist] off the desire of those less privileged to gain better opportunities and enforc[e] a control on their future labor. ...the planners of the modern U.S. university system...promoted equal opportunity in order to build America through its best talent. The rising tide of student debt...counteracts the meritocracy. ...the current system of college debt ... leads those less privileged to bind their futures.</i><p>I think you can meaningfully divide student borrowers into two groups. One group consists of those who reasonably estimate a positive ROI on their student loans. For these people, it may be somewhat troubling that you can't discharge the debt, but it seems at least somewhat fair since you can't divest yourself of the education, either. These students have no rational reason to complain: they made a financial investment and rationally expect to profit. In their case, the meritocracy is not only intact, but even helped by their ability to raise an investment.<p>The other group consists of those who can't rationally estimate a positive ROI on their student loans. If you're really serious about wanting that education, it's your call whether to blow tens of thousands of dollars on it and realize you will never repay your investment. You have to know you're impoverishing yourself for the sundry benefits of spending years of your life getting a college degree. Maybe it's still worth it. Maybe it's not. But if it isn't, it's not the lenders who are at fault, it's the cultural expectation to get a college degree, even in a field that doesn't increase your earning power. The lenders may benefit, but so do the universities, which get a glut of Ph.D.'s to string along for cheap adjunct positions and millions in tuition.
