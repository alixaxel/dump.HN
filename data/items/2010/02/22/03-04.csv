So it does seem likely that there are startup opportunities that get overlooked because they don't appeal as strongly to the stereotypical programmer demographic.<p>That said, I'm not sure what manner of confusion would lead to using the term ""entrepreneur"" for someone who has neither the resources to fund their ""big idea"" nor the skills to implement it.

Try taking your perspective to the 18th century when Adam Smith came up with the example I bastardised. To a manufacturer of pins (Smith's example) it must have appeared that all jobs were dissolving: Adam Smith estimated (his high estimate) a productivity increase from 1 to 4800 pins per day per person. Even if demand for pins grew ten or one hundred fold, the vast majority of pin makers (47/48 pin makers after a 100X <i>increase</i> in demand) would end up unemployed. Pins were just one unimportant example.<p>There are two things that would have seemed unbelievable to his contemporaries: (1) That demand could possibly increase by that much, not just for pins, but for stuff. How much can you eat? How much can you wear? (2) That all these people made redundant by machines would ever be needed for anything. Even if all these pins (and other stuff) made manufacture of other stuff cheaper (this would have been less part of the consciousness then), all that other stuff will be manufactured by machines too. If new stuff gets invented and manufactured (this would have also been unintuitive at the time) it too will be made by machines.<p>I think the trick to understanding the point of this example is the magnitude: 1 to 4800. For all practical purposes (at the time) that meant getting rid of <i>all</i> pin makers in the same way (actually, much more) as auto-checkout will get rid of all checkout chicks.",1266809659

I remember reading Dries, the found of Drupal, effectively claiming that all Drupal modules were GPL'ed and not liking it so much that I have altered my plans for future Drupal modules (all the better for me, my intellectual property will not be open for all to witness as I intend a more hosted solution which I can charge a higher premium for).<p>Ultimately, I feel like crusades by open source projects (WordPress, Drupal, etc) to GPL their modules will backfire and create a more restrictive, hosted component to them that they will ultimately regret. Dries did this for this anti-spam module, Mollom. I don't think he'd be so happy if core features like Views or CCK performed identically. Drupal would effectively suck. I guess thats all the more reason to reject the idea that plugins are derivative works.",1266808140

Because it's that way in your experience in Canada, doesn't make it true anywhere else.<p>My experience with the poor and homeless happened with actual ghetto dwellers in Baltimore, MD, not the sweet and fuzzy California or Canadian homeless.  I got stuck, through my school, volunteering at a soup kitchen every weekend for about eight weeks.  In that time, I witnessed the exact same people showing up every single day.  They referred to their welfare checks as their paychecks, openly purchased drugs, wore new Fubu clothes and new Nike shoes, and talked about the latest HBO shows.  This was somewhat ironic as, at the time, I couldn't afford cable TV or HBO, new brand name clothes, or very much of anything else, but I was able to pay for my own food.  I just couldn't go somewhere and have a person serve it to me though, as they were able to.  I could also afford to give up my weekend and drive to Baltimore to serve people that can afford fifty bucks for an eight ball, but cannot spare fifteen dollars for twenty pounds of rice.  In the entire eight weeks, I only met a single person that was actually down on their luck, everyone else was just lazy.<p>The reason poor people have no money is that they are awful at fiscal management.  Instead of food, they pay for cable, instead of rent, they buy drugs, expensive clothes, and shoes.  That's not my problem, and continuing to take care of people that refuse to care for themselves does nothing but perpetuate the problem.  These people won't work because they have no incentive to do so.  They receive more from the government than they could make with the amount of effort they're willing to expend.<p>If you want to solve homelessness and hunger, solve the problem of rich liberals feeling guilty and deciding to solve other peoples problems because they have too much time on their hands.",1266807775
