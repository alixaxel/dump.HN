I'm all for hiring people smarter than me and to do things I don't want to do. But most people starting a new project don't have money to do those hires.<p>Look at Paul Graham. When they started viaweb, Paul had to play sales guy. I believe he mentions in at least one essay, that it's not like sales was something he was chomping at the bit to go and do. But a fledging company can't go out and hire sales guys, so he stepped up and learned how to sell his product, and realized he was actually pretty good at it.<p>So this advice is to all those out there with no money who are stuck waiting for someone else to make their dreams come true.

1115634,story,,,2,0,halvarezo,"No one has a better idea than ospf?",,"The current standard for intra-domain network routing, Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), suffers from a number of problems-the tunable parameters (the weights) are hard to optimize, the chosen paths are not robust under changes in traffic or network state, and some network links are over-used at the expense of others. We present prototypical scenarios that illustrate these problems. Then we propose several variants of a protocol to eliminate or alleviate them and demonstrate the improvements in performance under those scenarios. We also prove that these protocols never perform significantly worse than OSPF and show that for at least a limited class of network topologies, it is possible to find efficiently the optimal weight settings. Some of the problems with OSPF are well known; indeed, there are several routing protocols that perform better than OSPF in routing quality (i.e., in terms of congestion, delay, etc.). OSPF's popularity persists in part because of its efficiency with respect to several resource bounds. In contrast, many competing protocols that provide routing superior to OSPF are computationally prohibitive. Motivated by this consideration, we designed our protocols not only to achieve better routing quality than OSPF, but also to use resources in amount comparable with OSPF with respect to offline broadcast communication, size of and time to compute routing tables, packet delivery latency, and packet header structure and size.",1265827626

1115628,comment,1115411,1115411,0,0,sailormoon,,,"I don't buy it. The whole premise is confused. On the one hand, the author makes some well-founded points about Japan's demographic situation, which is indeed pretty dire if gross numbers of working-age citizens are what you're predicting. China is in a similar boat, it's true, with the one child policy.<p>But Japan's downfall had little to do with demographics and a lot to do with an unsustainable bubble economy writ very large indeed. The problems with Japan are manyfold, you could write a very long essay just covering the major points, but basically boil down to cultural risk-averseness. There are not many entrepreneurs in Japan. The country needed to re-invent itself and failed.<p>China could not be more different. Many, many Chinese are entrepreneurial, brash go-getters. Whereas Japan is all about social harmony and ""wa"" and not rocking the boat, Chinese are the most capitalist people imaginable and a brief visit to basically any Chinese city will convince you utterly of this fact. I don't think you can compare the two at all.<p>It's true China has some systemic problems. If the banks' account sheets were audited properly I bet many of them are in the red, deeply. There is corruption and nepotism and all manner of petty inefficiencies imposed by officialdom. But the raw productivity cannot be denied.<p>The author also assumes the instability of the Chinese government. He/she seems to take this as a matter of faith - I see no signs of instability. If the government can raise people from poverty into a decent middle class - and they are doing an outstanding job of this - then their position is assured. The rich do not revolt.<p>I also have questions about the whole idea that more workers is what is needed to assure economic success. While it's true Japan's youth are dwindling in number, there is by no means a worker shortage in that country. If there was, wages would be high. They are not. There is plenty of youth unemployment. The growing automation of any number of industries may make all those idle youth obsolete. It may well turn out that in the future, less workers are needed, not more. And it's not as if America's teeming masses are particularly well-skilled. What will happen when a robot can flip the burgers? It's not too far off.<p>I could go on and on but basically I think the article makes an awful lot of assumptions and comes off as wishful thinking. I am not about to bet against America, but I wouldn't exactly sell my shares in China just yet either. I doubt China will rocket up to dominate the world like the breathless predictions of ""sinophiles"" but I can't see too many alternate futures where they don't have the largest economy by 2050.

1115616,comment,1114752,1114752,0,0,dkarl,,,"The author is just piling on against an unsatisfactory technique that used to be the least bad choice and which now thankfully has a chance of being displaced by new and better techniques.<p>There are a lot of reasons to hate on traditional modal dialogs.  Their scope isn't flexible enough.  Their association with different parts of a program isn't clear enough.  It's unclear what should happen when more than one modal dialog wants to be open.  Some of these problems are being mitigated by newer techniques.  Modal dialogs that pop over (internal to a component) instead of popping up (external to a component) are a godsend for tabbed applications, for example.  Users are also becoming more sophisticated, reducing the need for modal dialogs.  It's a good time to start shaking ourselves out of the old habit of relying on modal dialogs.<p>So the author's timing is good, but he misunderstands why modal dialogs became so common in the first place and why they can become much less common in the near future.  Half the reason for the latter is new GUI techniques; the other half is user sophistication.  The author doesn't mention either of these factors.  (The solutions the author proposes have been known for a loooong time; when modal dialogs are used instead, it is after the author's preferred solutions have been considered and rejected.)<p><i>Most modal dialogs are modal because it's easier for the programmer if you work that way; maintaining a consistent program state becomes messy and difficult if you have a bunch of dialog boxes open at once. </i><p>This is the opposite of true.  In a GUI application, components work independently and asynchronously.  Click ""Open"" twenty times, and I'll happily throw up twenty file choosers for you, or just open a single file chooser and raise-and-focus it nineteen times.  The programming frameworks make it easy to let your user open a zillion tabs and windows, and hey, the programmer doesn't have to remember which dialog goes with which tab.  That's the user's burden.  (This should be pretty obvious.  What's better at remembering the states and relationships of dozens of different GUI components:  a computer or a human being?)<p>In fact, a programmer's natural tendency is to make GUIs way too unconstrained.  If the user decides to open a wizard in each of his ten documents simultaneously, he must have a good reason for it, right?  Don't want to insult the user's intelligence.  Programmers naturally imagine Gimp-like interfaces with windows floating everywhere.  Navigation from feature to feature can be modeled as a completely connected graph -- perfect efficiency!  No artificial flow imposed!  Which should be wonderful, because:<p><i>People tend to be extremely ad-hoc in their working styles (to match their thinking styles), tackling little bits of a job in random order, working a little on this, a little on that, until the job is done.</i><p>I see you've made it to common sense.  Next stop:  real users.  Real users are the reason programmers resort to modal dialogs.  Real users ignore everything, even if it pops up and flashes at them.  (Forcing users to at least actively dismiss the dialog provides a little CYA for the programmer.)  Real users can't look around and find the reason their current action is blocked, even if it's visible on the screen.  Having it flash every time they click on another part of the application actually helps a lot.<p>Real users can't keep track of many GUI components.  They ""lose"" things with alarming regularity.

People can barely find a job. factories run below half capacity, the ones who are lucky enough to have some savings hold to them for dear life... just in case the things get even worse and they cannot earn some more.

Hell yes!  Not even a single hiccup, no little thanks to a very helpful and standup IT guy. Good ol' CVS did the job just fine. Could newer technology be better?  Yes perhaps I can think of a lot of hypotheticals where it would have been great to have a DVCS, but in practice, I can't think of all that many times where it would have made much of a difference.

I've met plenty of coders who are brilliant programmers but are completely baffled by the very simplest of operations in git when they fail. I'm not sure a better user experience is even remotely on the radar of the folks who work on git, so for git newbies, it's back to svn.<p>Has anyone else noticed this?<p>I'd love to get my day job's project moved from svn to git, given the tremendous benefits (we experience a lot of pain when branching our svn repo), but the pain of moving has to be eased significantly. Moving a repo like ours doesn't just involve importing the repo, it involves training, dealing with all the errors and hangups, figuring out how to make our ancient installation Trac talk to our repo, connecting it to Eclipse and NetBeans, and adjusting all of our build processes.

Every auto maker wants to make their cars cheaper and cheaper, and at the end of the day something has to give for the prices consumers demand... this includes redundancy and QA.<p>In the short time I was in the industry, I was involved in multiple recalls - none of which as deadly as Toyota's here, but all of which were the direct result of cost cutting. In two of those recalls, the blame lied solely on using cheaper, brittle plastic parts as a cost-cutting measure applied by the major automakers. Not that they're pocketing the savings of course, those generally get passed straight onto you, the consumer.<p>Shortly after I left the industry Toyota unveiled the Camry redesign - and I remember remarking that something bad had to happen with this car. It gave way too much bang for your buck, I cannot imagine the invisible corners that were cut to bring this vehicle to market. Now I suppose we know - and the age-old mantra still rings true: there ain't no such thing as a free lunch.<p>Keep that in mind when you buy your next car, seriously. The plant where I worked made parts for everything from cheapo Pontiacs to expensive Mercedes - and let me tell you, you <i>do</i> get what you pay for. Disregard ignorant laymen who insist that the expensive marques are nothing but branding, there is a very, very real difference in what you're getting (and that includes tolerances, redundancy, and testing level).",1265825021

If you notice, he's pointing out that they are actually too full of content for him to complete before the next shiny object grabs his attention.<p>Yes, we rate ""playtime"" as one of our attributes of quality.   ""For $50, I better get more than 1 hour of playtime out of an RPG or other exploration game"" is a common concern; vs. replayability or addictiveness of the casual gaming world.<p>But just like Blaise Pascal's quote (<a href=""http://www.famousquotes.com/show.php?_id=1045873"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.famousquotes.com/show.php?_id=1045873</a>) “I didn't have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead,"" (no, it's not Mark Twain), if we had games that took some of the time of adding just one more world or level and instead enhanced aspects of the main game, aka judicious editing, well, perhaps we'd be able to experience more of the game, and even feel a sense of completion.  We'd have less stuff to conquer, but perhaps the conquering could be more subtle, have more ways to solve, have more realism, better characters, more complex motivations, whatever.<p>In playing some of these games he mentions as the good ones, I experienced meaningless quests (my friends called them ""bolt ons""), busy-work, farming, all sorts of things that didn't move the story forward, or involved repetitive labor.  They weren't puzzles, they were just grunt work.  These could have been edited out and the effort spent elsewhere, reducing ""time to complete"" but making a good game even better.<p>So, if a game needs lots of time to complete a vast and compelling story, or it's a subscription game that needs more content, so be it.  But instead of a game requiring as much work as, well, my job, perhaps a game that gave more enjoyment but also allowed me to feel a sense of completion would be a popular game.<p>Look, sometimes I love a 500 page book or a 3 hr movie or watching a miniseries or season in one sitting; we all do.  But we don't want them all the time.  Perhaps we should hold games accountable not on ""hours to complete"" but on ""satisfaction felt upon completion, given that the game should take more than 1 hour"".   This puts the emphasis on immersion, storytelling, interaction and not so much on ""cram more junk in"".<p>As an aside, if we complete more games and feel more satisfied when we do, we will buy more games.   Sounds like a win for both sides.",1265824889
