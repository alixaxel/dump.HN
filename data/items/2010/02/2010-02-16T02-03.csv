UNR is dangerously close to being mass-market ready, and it's certainly ready for developers and power-users.  Virtually everything 'just works', and the Netbook Remix UI is far preferable to Windows or OS X on a small screen.<p>The most remarkable thing is that you <i>never</i> have to drop to a command prompt, unless you want to.  All of the linux infrastructure and tools are there, but it's all been abstracted away with a nice clean GUI.  For the first time in my life, I actually prefer using X over the shell for managing my machine.<p>It's also amazing to look at how rapidly Canonical is improving Ubuntu.  Every six months, I get more functionality and new software, with an improved UI and fewer rough edges.  I'm anxiously awaiting 10.04, and I know that 10.10 should be another big improvement.  That kind of predictability is nice.<p>I jumped ship from Linux to OS X nine years ago, when OS X 10.0 came out.  I hated wrestling with X, battling device drivers, and constantly missing basic functionality.  All those problems are finally solved, and I'm back on board.  'Desktop Linux' may never happen, but 'Mobile Linux' is definitely here, and it's pretty darned cool.",1266289102

Some of the ""in the box"" apps put all their data inside the Android directory, but others use ""data"", some use the Java-style reversed DNS (com.example.App), others use the same but with dashes (com-example-App), and others again just dump their guts into the root directory (espeak-data, amazonmp3) etc.<p>It all reminds me of DOS days when people would install their apps in subdirs of the root directory, or even worse, neophytes who installed their apps in the root directory itself.

Adobe's Flash Player is ubiquitous on computers, but the company's Flash Lite effort hadn't met with much success extending the programming foundation to mobile phones. With a new generation of relatively powerful smartphones on the market, Adobe is trying again with a full-featured but lightweight version of the computer software, Flash Player 10.1, due in the first half of 2010.
Flash is missing from the highest-profile smartphone, Apple's iPhone, though, and the upcoming iPad, a situation that has left Adobe unhappy. By joining LiMo, it gains a new avenue for corporate alliances, including some big names in the mobile phone market. Other LiMo members include LG Electronics, NEC, NTT Docomo, Orange, Panasonic, Samsung, SK Telecom, Telefonica, Vodafone, and Verizon Wireless.
Adobe said its Creative Suite programming and authoring tools for Flash will be able to create Flash programs for LiMo devices, a move it said will simplify building Flash into those devices.
""Bringing the Flash Platform to LiMo opens up a significant opportunity for Adobe to further its goals of open standards and multi-screen interoperability of rich mobile content,"" said David Wadhwani, general manager of Adobe's Flash business.
The San Jose, Calif.-based company announced the move in conjunction with the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona.",1266286787

It had a problem that whenever an interrupt would happen close to an HD ACCESS, the text {IDE TIMEOUT} would crawl across the screen until you pressed the debugger interrupt switch, after which it would continue on. This meant that any form of input while it was accessing the HD would result in the interrupt switch being hit, or even transferring data from the CD to the HD would take for-ev-er.<p>This meant the normally 45-minute install process turned into about two-and-a-half-hours of babysitting the poor laptop. I also became very conscious of memory/swap usage early on, so I had to use a rather light window manager (I think I settled on AfterStep as a decent combination of features and light-ness). I also learned how to tune X11 color requirements, since only 256-color mode was supported.<p>A good way to cut my teeth initially. Later on I got my parents to purchase a 7200/75, which was the cheapest Mac I could find that would run the official Linux/PPC distribution.

This means that at least for some time, unemployment was higher as a result of the automation. The thing to remember is that you can't mothball workers, you cant say ""hey dont eat or live untill the job creation curve from this new tech catches back up, you'll be in demand again"". So while the net effect of automation is more jobs, it still doesn't make the immediate (within a workers lifetime) impact necessarily better.<p>Another thing the article mentions is a 4400% increase in the number of jobs. This is not population growth, (it is only 3 generations assuming child labor), so where did those people come from? Were they more skilled workers earning good wages replaced by automation? Were they unskilled workers whose previous jobs had been automated away (ditch diggers and the like)?<p>In one case you have a net loss in liquidity in the hands of people, this is the net equivelant of lost jobs. In the other case you have a potential gain in liquidity. Once again, not making a case for or agains the automation, just discussing if the employment is equivelant.<p>To use your analogy its not like me asking if we should continue with the rugby at all. It's more like me saying ""Hey guys, I know that the mechanism is different, but can we also look at the fact that 100 more teams in the cup might dilute the quality of play?""",1266286193

With crime, ""a stitch in time saves nine."" Catching a small incident and having the person change behavior leads to enormous changes over time.<p>For an example that many consider trivial, cursing is at an all time high. Cursing's purpose in life is to convey and share anger: it is not conducive to high quality, cheerful life. There is research in psychology that shows that expressing anger leads to more, not less, of it. I actually consider quitting HackerNews entirely due to the poor quality of auto-removal of cursing in titles, text, and remarks. I am very repulsed by the ruby community for the same reason. For exaple, ruby sub, an email client has an homepage that features cursing. I just feel ick and don't even want to try it any more.<p>A second glaring example, imho, is vandalism. Nowadays, when I accosted a vandal in NYC, he gave me the NY Times' justifications for his crime. He said ""it's art!"" and ""I'm black and I'm angry!"" He has absorbed all the anti-capitalist myths; I am sure he never read Atlas Shrugged! The amount of property destruction is enormous. That is crime and that is way way up.<p>In some ways, the world is getting alot better: Ayn Rand's philosophy is being developed and publicized. Those who uphold her ideas of independence, rationality, etc, are very civilized. Thus it's a race between her ideas and those of Kant.",1266286129

The browser is buggy, and email lacks a lot of basic features.  The network services are also unfinished or missing.  The calendar doesn't sync with google calendar, there's no facebook integration, there's no address book synchronization.  There's also a lot of missing UI niceties.<p>What's frustrating about is that all of the infrastructure is there to have those things.  They've developed a nice abstraction layer for hooking into web services, as well as a great UI toolkit for building slick-looking applications on a small screen.  They've also got awesome power management, and an amazingly fast boot process.  Moblin makes your little atom-based netbook feel amazingly responsive.<p>My hunch is that Moblin has been building things from the 'bottom up', i.e. power management, networking, display drivers, and tools.  Maemo seems to have the opposite approach, where they have a lot more UI polish and finished applications, but they might not have the robust underlying infrastructure code.<p>If both companies play to their strengths, then we might get a pretty nice linux for small screens.  If that happens, I'll jump ship from Ubuntu in a heartbeat.",1266286106

Technology development isn't the point of an investment in a company like this (though some new tech will be needed and created). You need to find editors, create partnerships, advertise (as dirty a word as that may be) and provide runway to iterate. A question site on graphic design might be different than one on cooking and even more different from one on the finer points of SQL. I do think the land grab comparison is fair. If you can get into the verticals quickly and establish a lead in content it is that much harder for the next guy.<p>I like 37S, but I don't get the compulsive need to criticize anyone that takes funding or sells their company as a sell out.",1266285854
