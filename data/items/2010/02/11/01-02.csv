For instance, by abstracting all recursion into the catamorphism framework, the destructor function that does all the heavy lifting can often be easily expressed in a subset of the language that contains only total functions (that is, functions that always produce a valid result in finite time), allowing (comparatively) simple proofs of correctness.<p>This also pairs well with the mirrored approach of building (potentially infinite) data in an ""on demand"" manner. Abstracting the corecursion into the anamorphism likewise allows the constructor functions to often be total.<p>Turing-completeness is overrated!",1265851864

I don't see Google spending more than 10x than what their closest competitors spend. Especially when they can cherry pick an easy market for the test.<p>Still, the capital expenditure is offset by revenues coming in. At $50/mo that's $600 in revenue coming in per year for each household.

If you accept the assertion that everyone uses gmail, and that everyone loves the gmail interface, and that people keep gmail open all day (or at least check it fairly often), then Google Buzz seems like a great idea - a social network tied into all the services you use every day.<p>It breaks down when you start breaking those assertions. If you're not in Gmail every day (e.g. if you use an IMAP client), or if you don't like the interface (but you have to use it, e.g. Google Apps), or if you don't use gmail at all, then Google Buzz becomes a huge hassle to use.<p>I'd love to love Buzz, because I like awesome things, but it seems to me that the Buzz team just assumes everyone loves Gmail as much as Google does, and that's not going to pan out.

1116603,comment,1116085,1116569,0,0,jrockway,,,"Well, my guess is that xargs simply does not accept a filename as the argument.  This comes from reading the --help and grepping the manpage for ""file"".<p>The point was, when I used ""cat file |"", I knew it was going to work, and it did.  When I tried to eliminate the cat by using the program's built-in ability to read a file, I had to read several manpages before determining that it was not possible.  All because some tutorial says ""cat is useless"", when it clearly saved me much more time than the extra CPU time it used.<p>And if you are actually asking; xargs is just a utility to read command-line-arguments from stdin.  `echo -e ""foo\nbar"" | xargs rm' === `rm foo; rm bar' (or depending on the xargs implementation; `rm foo bar').  It kind of reminds me of a ""functor map"" operation, where stdin is a functor (of command-line arguments), and command-line programs are functions.  (I will now mention that xargs also does ""join"" on the ""results"" of the ""function"", which is very ... monad-like.

Then it was about social networking, then producing content on those networks.<p>I think the search engines that are trying the social graph approach to ranking might be onto something.  Using all my friends to refine my searches has some serious potential.<p>So, I'd say that I think the next big thing is filtering that firehose of data.",1265850414

Secondly, when people get older and they sit down at a computer, they do so to get stuff done.  When a kid sits down at a machine they explore without expectation of themselves.  Adults have the expectation that - what they want to get done - will get done - and in a reasonable amount of time.  However, some things do take more than a ""reasonable amount of time"", and frustration mounts because of this expectation.  Soon, learning new things becomes associated with frustration.  So relax a little, and explore a lot.  Then read the docs.  Or read the docs - and then explore.  Just don't expect to be productive in the New-Software-Product in 2 hours.",1265850151
