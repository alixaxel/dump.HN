1125709,comment,1124979,1124979,0,0,arpan888,,,"This is what happens when the government interferes with the free market!  The supply of virtually unlimited, guaranteed federal loans has created a moral hazard.  Loan companies don't care to hand out risky loans because they have the backing of the federal government.  Since students have access to so much ""free"" money, they are entering colleges in droves, effectively bidding up tuition prices for the rest of us. Without such a supply, loan companies would be much more stringent (tuition would come down) and some students would not be able to enter college.  While this may sound bad, its not because certain college degrees are becoming worthless anyway and some students have no business of earning degrees in human resources management from the University of Phoenix.",1266199172
1125708,comment,1125433,1125433,0,0,carsonbaker,,,"I'm halfway through his book <i>You Are Not a Gadget</i> and I give it very low marks so far, but not for the writing or the ideas presented -- the latter of which, however, is  disappointingly nebulous. The main problem is that Lanier consistently chooses poor examples to make a point and presents very little real evidence to support his claims. He mainly complains a lot about fuzzy circumstances and persuades very little.<p>For example, on page 12 Lanier elucidates the idea that ""entrenched software philosophies become invisible through ubiquity."" It begins, ""An even deeper locked-in idea is the notion of the file. Once upon a time, not too long ago, plenty of computer scientists thought the idea of the file was not so great."" The section ends, ""The idea of the file has become so big that we are unable to conceive of a frame large enough to fit around it in order to assess it empirically.""<p>In between are three sparse paragraphs. The first paragraph mentions Xanadu and the original iteration of the Mac OS as examples of systems that didn't use files. The second and third paragraphs complain that now every system uses files, that we're locked in to using filesystems, and we can't even conceive of systems without files.<p>At this point while reading I'm very curious about Xanadu and trying to conceive of file-less systems myself. I'm desperately waiting for the author to support the analogy, but he quickly moves on to claim that ""[lock-in] could happen soon to the definition of a human being.""<p>Wait, what? Stop, and tell me about these file-less organizational systems. Why can't we conceive of them anymore? Why didn't they gain traction? Prove to me that we're really locked-in and that's a bad thing. I'm not accepting your segue -- how exactly is this a worthy example for your larger point?<p>And so it goes. I've picked one example, but it's truly page after page of baseless assumptions, spacey ideas, thin examples, and doubtful conclusions. <i>Where is the evidence?</i> I'm screaming at the pages imagining my high school english teacher scribbling ""illustrate!"" in red ink across the margins.",1266199155

1125681,comment,1125132,1125132,0,0,gridspy,,,"Okay, so from my vantage as an electrical manufacturer the point of syncfu is to help me achieve economies of scale. The more people that purchase, the more I can lower my price.<p>You don't currently obligate buyers to make an actual purchase, so the price that the other buyers pay might be too heavily discounted. For example, 100 people reserve, but only 20 actually buy - in this case I might not make a profit since the per unit costs for 20 are much higher than for 100.<p>I'd rather see a similar grouping mechanism that requires full commitment from both buyers and sellers, like ebay does. You'd probably have to do this with accounts, points and validation.<p>As for the actual purchase you could do this:<p>The seller creates a graph of price vs size of the production run, as now. They specify how often they would like to do production runs (sales).<p>Each buyer specifies the maximum amount they would be willing to pay, by clicking on the purchase graph. They specify how long they are willing to wait until it reaches that price. They enter all their credit card and billing details into the system, and have made a promise to purchase at that price or below.<p>When the sale ends, the system attempts to solve the graph for price. Everyone who ""bid"" above this price pays the solved price, everyone below is moved to the next run, unless their stated ""latest date"" would be passed by waiting that long.<p>You then bill everyone who said that they would pay. You make the lump sum available to the retailer who then satisfies the orders. This way there is no risk to a buyer that they will pay more than they want, and no risk to a seller that you will set the wrong price.<p>When I say solve for price, what I mean is that<p>- 1 person chooses the 1 user price (A)<p>- 2 people chose the 5 user price (B)<p>you solve, 1 user (A) gets the 1 user price, they get billed, B moves into next round (unless their time limit has expired)<p>now more people come along<p>- 5 users choose the 10 user price (C)<p>- 6 users chose the 12 user price (D)<p>+ 2 people chose the 5 user price (B)<p>So now you can manufacture at the 13 user price because that will satisfy everyone.",1266197783

1125645,comment,1125315,1125587,0,0,whatusername,,,"The ""extra mile"" probably comes from Matthew 5:41 ""If someone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.""  (or ""And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain."")  You used the phrase perfectly in your comment -- it's about going above and beyond what was expected.<p>The mileage comment was more from the auto manufacturers / EPA who tested cars.  A car will have been tested on specific conditions and found to achieve a certain Miles per Gallon.  However - accelerate/brake hard, drive more in the city or other different conditions and you would get a completely different result.  Hence the standard disclaimer of ""your mileage may vary...""  That made it's way into the lingo as a standard phrase meaning ""this is pretty subjective - it might be the same for you, it might not""<p>So aside from the word ""mileage"" being derived from the base word ""mile"", there isn't much overlap between the two phrases.<p>(Oh - and a related note for my American friends - as much as I hate imperial units - I will give you credit that mileage is a nice word.  litres/100km is still a better unit than MPG, but mileage is a better term than fuel efficiency (or kilometreage).)",1266195934
