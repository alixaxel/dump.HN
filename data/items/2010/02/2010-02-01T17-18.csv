1092936,comment,1092312,1092312,0,0,coffeemug,,,"I love NYC. My life is there. If I could move my startup to NYC, I would do it in a heartbeat. But every venture requires <i>capital</i>, some more than others. Pretty much all ""early stage"" funds make one or two early stage investments a year, most likely into someone they already know. That means most first-time entrepreneurs have to pitch to dozens of funds before they get funding. Most first-time startup founders I know scheduled three meetings with VCs per day, five days a week, for at least two-three weeks before they got anywhere. That's at least thirty meetings with all kinds of VCs of all shapes and sizes! If you were to do this in NYC, you'd exhaust your opportunities within two days. Six funds cannot possibly support a healthy startup ecosystem. The Valley has thousands, and I've still seen some good early stage teams that didn't get adequate funding. All arguments end here - no capital, no startup scene.<p>If you've already started a successful company before and you already have a good relationship with one of the funds in NYC (i.e. they invested in you before and you didn't screw it up), you can start thinking about starting up in NYC. If your company is taking off like a rocket, you can start thinking about moving to NYC (in this case you'll get funded pretty much anywhere). If you can bootstrap, you can start thinking about starting up in NYC. Otherwise, moving your startup to NYC is suicide.",1265047121

Therefore, the Bill of Rights, and the First Amendment, cannot apply to them. QED.</i><p>My comment was primarily directed to the concluding statements (quoted above) that posit a deductive argument in absolute terms and that conclude that the Bill of Rights ""cannot apply"" to corporations. This absolute position simply cannot be defended based on the law. I agree with you that the issue can get more complicated if the point is limited to the question of free speech.

It's a terrible example, for the simple reason that a lot of people <i>are</i> breaking the law and hiding behind legal technicalities to get away with it, and the law itself is <i>not</i> self-evidently unreasonable in providing the concept of copyright.<p>Yes, there have been miscarriages of justice, and there have been abuses of the legal system (particularly in the US, which in my studious and considered opinion has a dumb legal system that encourages such actions by the big boys with vast legal warchests).  Of course these things are bad and legal systems that allow them would be better if they had stronger safeguards to protect the innocent.<p>But if you look at the big picture, there are a lot of people (mostly young ones) growing up with this unhealthy attitude that anything you can physically do is OK and you can take what you want for free because you'll get away with it.

That means that you can store 140 8bit characters, eg Latin1 encoding, in a text message.<p>However, the GSM default encoding is 7bit packed. Each character is 7bit and they are packed together into the 140 octets, this leaves a maximum size of 160 characters per message.<p>For international characters, GSM uses USC2, which is a 16bit encoding, limiting messages to 70 characters.<p>You can also send concatenated messages, where multiple SMS messages make up the actual message text. In this case, you must subtract (from memory, so may be off) 4 octets from the limits, for the user data header. The user data header consists of a length and one or more information elements. An information element consists of 3 octets: an information element identifier (in this case, 0, for concatenated message) and some parameters (I'm not sure if this is specific to the IEI? I could look it up, but I'm too lazy.. for concatenated messages, the next octet is number of messages and the final one is the current message index).<p>Hopefully someone found this information interesting ;-)",1265045592

There's a default concept of ""Googliness"" which everyone understands to be a kind of high-energy, primary-color blandness with near-magical UI. There aren't a lot of projects that deviate from that, no matter what the designer thinks.<p>If you compare it to the kind of design variety you see at Yahoo or even Microsoft you'll see what I mean. At Yahoo a lot of projects are almost led by design, for good (Flickr) or ill (almost everything else).

The ruling against McCain-Feingold states that government does not have the power to create penalties (criminal or civil) that limit speech.  In the case of McCain-Feingold, the court ruled that it was enough to base its ruling simply on the assumption that the law ""may"" limit speech, without proof that it actually has.  I think this is reasonable.  Here is where it unravels:<p>There are other laws the government has passed that provide penalties as McCain-Feingold does.  A key example is broadcast spectrum sales.  The FCC has sold rights of public spectrum and provides criminal penalties for infringing on the use of that spectrum.  This of course creates third party arbiters of content and has provably limited speech.  Case in point: next week's SuperBowl will show an ad against abortion but has refused an ad for a gay dating site.  Political ads are refused all the time by major broadcasters when they do not suit the content arbiters.
