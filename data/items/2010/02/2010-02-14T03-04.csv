1124109,comment,1123873,1123989,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>the massive fragmentation problem that I currently have with social networks.</i><p>I've always thought that the tendency to view social network fragmentation as some sort of <i>problem</i>, rather than as a rather useful <i>feature</i>, is a major blind spot for programmers. This Buzz debacle does nothing to discourage that hypothesis.<p>I blame the database training. After you've spent enough time wrestling databases you begin to dream of putting the universe into normal form. You envision a world where every piece of data might be seamlessly linked to any other with some sort of super-powered JOIN command. This is the dream that leads people to think that single-sign-on across the entire web would be a great thing. Unfortunately, this dream is also Orwell's nightmare.<p>I have a lot of friends. Some of them are elderly former carpenters who have never used computers. Some of them are college-aged aspiring hackers. Some know me personally. Some  know me mainly as a pseudonym on HN. Some of them are middle-aged hippie folk musicians. Some of them work for major military contractors. Some of them are professors on the tenure track. Some of them barely have a high school education. Some of them are millionaires. Some of them are unemployed. Some of them are theoretical physicists, but many more of them loathed high school physics.<p>I have no particular desire to put all of these people in the same room at the same time. The one occasion where I was compelled to approximate that even slightly -- my wedding -- was the occasion of more than a little stress, despite every single guest's friendliness and good cheer. Because it's really very difficult to throw a party where everyone you know feels equally welcome.<p>I would not be surprised to discover that social networks are going to remain fragmented because most people like them that way.",1266119742

Make that where they diverge most strongly.<p>>My approach would be to apply the exact damage to the aggressor that they applied to the victim, except where the victim forgives all or part (for monetary ""damages"" or some other consideration or reason).<p>I'm going to assume your talking about assault. If I'm wrong, sorry. In any case, we can't just let them settle it with a fee to cover damages. The aggressor demonstrated themselves a threat to the Public. Depending on the circumstances, the aggressor will need to spend some time in jail, with a psychologist, doing community service, reporting to a probation officer, et cetra, or most likely a combination of the above, for the protection of society.<p>If there was material damage in addition to that, it is not a criminal matter and can be settled in the way you described.<p>>As far as I can tell, your approach (along with the vast majority of existing legal systems today) requires sentencing or damages to be decided individually by a third party, rather than by the parties already involved, which seems inelegant.<p>As the previous example illustrates, this is only true for criminal matters.",1266119428

Of course there are scholars who do so, but in practice, the costs are largely ignored, just like any externality tends to get ignored by individual agents in an economic system. That leads to an argument that environmental effects must fall under the umbrella of governmental responsibility, since those calculating cost/benefit ratios are rarely those who will pay the brunt of the costs of climate change and other such effects. This is especially evident if one considers the quality-of-life concerns, which are by their very nature cross-cutting, and thus hard to account for at the level of an individual or single corporation.",1266118669

Centralizing energy production enables better scaling (small ICEs are on average much less efficient than large ones), reduces the cost of deploying new technologies as they become available, enables depending on local opportunities for renewable energy, etc. There are many good proposals for how to store energy in-vehicle, such as capacitors, batteries, flywheels, fuel cells and even pneumatic storage. There's many good business opportunities to be had exploring these options and bringing them to market. See, for example, Tesla Motors and the Chevy Volt.
