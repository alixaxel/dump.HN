It's a bit like saying that all questions are ambiguous just because some are and because precision is difficult. Also, relativism is ambiguous about whether contextual knowledge is absolutely truth within that context; many relativists object to the idea of any absolute, permanent, unitary truth. But why should the truth for a given context ever change? Relativism provides an argument that the context is important, but no argument that the truth can change if we keep the context constant.</i><p>If you look into eastern philosophies, you'll find an interesting concept: that there is in fact no objective truth that can be expressed.<p>This is subtly different from a relativistic argument, though. The idea is, we can only express thoughts, ideas, etc, in terms of words and concepts that are products of our minds. And those products of our minds are intrinsically personal. Even with mundane things like tables or hoovers we might disagree on the meaning of words. Society teaches us to have more or less the same meanings so we can communicate, but those are intrinsically relative.<p>So then, there may well be an underlying, intrinsically ""absolutely true"" reality (in fact, there almost certainly is), but any attempt to express it results in a statement of relative truth.",1265769687

He thinks that the purpose of history is to ""use the past as a resource for living in the present."" In order to do that, he thinks that it is necessary to memorize all relevant historical facts -- even the ones that don't have fun interesting stories. Memorizing what happened and in what order is the only way one can fully integrate the historical context into ones understanding.<p>Here is a link to Scott Powell's article for comparison: <a href=""http://www.historyatourhouse.com/?p=154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.historyatourhouse.com/?p=154</a>",1265768075
