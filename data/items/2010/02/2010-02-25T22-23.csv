It's not only far simpler for, say, my dad (who is still slightly unsure whether computers fall under the realm of science or witchcraft - both being bad), but it also makes things easier for me. You can read that as ""one less click to get into emacs"" if you want.<p>But on a serious note, the actual interface of the OS seems to be far less important for tech-savvy people. I'm using Windows 7 right now, alt-tabbing between a web-browser and emacs (finally getting around to exploring Clojure, if you're interested), and would be doing exactly the same if I'd booted into Linux this evening instead. 'Computer people' know what they want to do on their machines and do it; and cross-platform is king for 'their sort of app', these days.<p>My dad, on the other hand, thinks that computers are largely operated by shout-recognition. He'd love an iPad. He can point at the thing, it does the thing - he's not prepared to learn, to know or to think about it. That's the market Apple will be aiming for; people who view computers as being more like toasters than toolboxes - that thing they use to do that thing. And people love toasters.<p>However, I genuinely believe that the likes of UNR offer a far better compromise over-all, because most people start out with flailing and shouting - it would be an awful shame to deny them the tools to move beyond that, should they be so inclined.",1267137391

Every time some sort of ridiculous regulation has been put in place the big corporations have had the capital to comply, and the individuals have been given even more roadblocks to compete. The lack of imagination is not in not imagining a peer to peer web, but rather in not imagining a Google that can innovate around these restrictions.<p>Take this safe harbor thing. Let's say that it becomes abolished for sites like YouTube across the board. Do you think Google would say ""oh too bad, time to shut down the site"". Of course not. Google has the money to pay for a million mechanical-turk style people to view every video, and the innovative prowess to create programs that would do filtering as well. The end result would be that they would probably err on the side of being too cautious, and we'd have a YouTube with far less content.<p>However, the true problem here is that if I now wanted to compete with YouTube, it would be impossibly difficult due solely to the liability of it all. I can't afford to have a huge staff looking at every video, or massive servers running analysis on every upload. So all of a sudden what you've done is SOLIDIFY YouTube's stranglehold on content.<p>Not to mention that you've all of a sudden given Google the perfect excuse for denying any content they want, they can now just hide behind ""liability concerns"".

If you are a business site, why would you fill your site with childish playful images? Do you specialize in business that cater to children? if so, then it might make sense, but I'm not getting that context form what you have. 
'Increase turnover'? Shouldn't that be 'decrease turnover'? or I guess it depends on what 'turnover' is referring to. You want to limit staff turnover, not increase it. 'Impove their bottom line'. Who are they? I want to improve my bottom line.
