Most of the sounds already can be found in English, the tones are perhaps the only hard part. The structure and grammar are incredibly simple (albeit the writing system isn't).<p>I agree to your point about programming for non-techies though.

We stayed with Time Warner for at least 2 years, and they never rolled out DOCSIS 3 support at their end. The maximum speed we could get from them was 6Mbps. We're now using DSL, and the maximum we can get is 6Mbps, though with more reliability than from cable.<p>The nearest cable box is next to our neighbor's driveway. The phone company has fiber to their box in our other neighbor's yard.<p>There's enough competition to keep price inflation mostly at bay, but there clearly isn't enough to convince the ISPs to invest in the equipment that would be able to give us connections that are four times faster. Efficiency doesn't have a lot to do with it. For all practical purposes, our local ISPs aren't spending <i>any</i> money to improve service in areas that already have some service.",1265835454

Some perceive China to be adopting non-cooperative ""I win, you lose"" strategies that will motivate defensive and non-cooperative measures from other countries. This is bad, potentially very bad.<p>Also, even if the global economy is better now than it was when China was undeveloped, that doesn't mean China's policies are ideal.

Mastering pronunciation is very important, especially if you don't want to talk with a thick accent, but it doesn't mean you've got to do it before saying a complete sentence.<p>I don't entirely get the analogy... is she learning assembly and CPU design before learning 'print ""Hello world""'?

The problem was that with Git or Hg, when you fetch you get every version of every file for the whole history of the project.  Which means if you've had a lot of big files, you get ALL of them.  Also, they don't delta compress well, so that can be a lot, much of which you may never need again, so it's inefficient.  For most projects, this isn't a big deal, but if you have a bunch of large texture files or video that MUST be in the project (game development, perhaps), this can be an issue.<p>Subversion is ""better"" at this only because it does shallow checkouts - it only gets the last version of the project.  It is still ludicrously inefficient in it's transfer protocol.<p>Git can actually do this type of development fine - if you do 'git clone --depth=1 [url]' it will also do a shallow clone (just the last commit and it's associated content) and will transfer the data much more efficiently than SVN.  In the past you couldn't then commit to that repo, which was the issue, but in newer versions you can.  You can also later deepen the repository if you want.

I got started with C many years ago and I remember savoring every moment. :) I think what may account for the difference is that in my case the interest in programming stemmed from wanting to learn how the computer worked and C's low level nature facilitated this very well. With regard to the author it seems she's more anxious to start creating real useful applications. I get the impression she's more interested in the end product of the programming than the actual programming process.<p>Currently I do most of my development for the linux platform but I was considering moving to windows to take advantage of some opportunities in that area but I am facing some of the same challenges as the author of the article. The C# language and .NET platform are a whole new world and it feels like I am starting from scratch. It's hard to justify as I can do everything I need to do on the linux platform.",1265832382

Have people play it a few times, and then have everyone come up with and write down the rules. Emphasize the writing things down formally part, since that's the most basic type of programming. Have them play the game again, but this time using the rules they defined. You could give out awards for the kids who find errors in the rules. Try a different game (tic-tac-toe? rock paper scissors?) and repeat the exercise.<p>Once they've figured out that, give them a bare-bones vocabulary (eg something like python, but don't tell them it's a programming language) to write the rules in.",1265832242

Also, sometimes you need to do projects that don't end in a product you can sell in order to learn new things, so get used to throwing stuff away (not literally, of course, but certainly from a revenue standpoint).<p>Overall though, knowing how to code (and having learned for the ""right reasons"") is hugely helpful in dealing with Software people in the future.
