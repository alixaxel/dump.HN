I remember when 3DStudios used to require a hardware dongle(A device you had to have plugged in for the software to run.) The iPhone and co. are like dongles that you actually want to buy. We are paying for the store and then only buying from it as well as being held hostage by the fact that we don't actually own what we purchased as it requires the devices controlled by apple to use our purchases. It's the ultimate lock-in.<p>Note: Protecting content can not occur without tight control by apple, otherwise apps for accessing pirated content would proliferate. I'm starting to actually think that Apple has found the perfect racket and there is no way open systems can compete until someone comes along with Apple's design and manufacturing skills. There platform is just bigger and more consistent than any other competitor's with better tools and less variation in hardware designs.<p>ps. If you think the App approval process is annoying try being a game developer, it takes months to get your game through the processes required by Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft.

Someone grows a pineapple farm, and sells pineapples. There are no other pineapples, so he charges a lot for them. He becomes rich. Other farmers hear of this and start growing pineapples - they become rich at the start, but as pineapples become more available, soon the price of pineapples is the same as everywhere else. But people have a lot of invested resources in pineapples, so they start selling at discounts. There are more pineapples than consumers, so people start getting aggressive with their sales. The guys who made the money leave the unprofitable market to go sell maize, but the late entries who have just invested in pineapples, and the people who were dirt poor, are still battling on, trying to sell their pineapples. They start harvesting unripe pineapples and heating them to make them seem ripe quicker.<p>People get disillusioned with all the shit pineapples they are getting and decide to rather buy some other fruit without all the competition.

1110914,comment,1110312,1110843,0,0,ehsanul,,,"I have no hard-earned experience with this myself. I've just been thinking about it myself a lot because I have a potentially write-intensive application in the works, and I'm anticipating aperformance issues with writes (but I should probably find out if it actually is an issue). My goal is to squeezing as much performance as I can from as few machines - I'm poor.<p>To explain my use case.. I'm basically storing a graph in MongoDB, which is a document/object based database. Reads would consist of enumerating a node's edges. Writes would be adding nodes/edges and updating edge weights. It would perform best on reads if I just had one contiguous object for each node, holding information about all nodes connected to it, as well as edge weights. But since some nodes may have too many connected nodes, they are divided in the database by the page they would show up on in the application, as ranked by edge weight. So an object with id 'node1page1' holds information about the top 10 ranked connecting nodes.<p>Now, if that made any sense, the problem: Edge weights change according to votes from users. So when a weight changes, ranks change, and I've structured things in such a way that the computation of ranks is basically pushed to the write rather than the read. So when someone checks 'node1page2' and votes a node on page 2 up, the corresponding edge weight changes and may require that node's information to be shifted to 'node1page1', while the lowest edge on 'node1page1' is to be shifted to 'node1page2'.<p>So what's happened here is that while I've made reads fast by requiring just a lookup, writes become complicated. And here's where the buffering of writes comes in. Perhaps I'm overthinking all this, but like I said, I'm poor.<p>Replication in-memory would definitely be useful, especially for a larger cluster with some spare capacity. You'd probably have good power redundancy when running a large cluster, so single machine failures would be much more common than a total cluster failure I'd think (no hard data here, but seems reasonable enough). So I don't think it's all that naive to believe that generally more than one host would not go down within 30s.<p>Even if the whole cluster does go down, you should only be doing this with low-value data. In my application's case, losing 30 seconds of votes is no big deal at all, I'd be much more concerned with getting the machine(s) back up.",1265669058

1110892,comment,1110490,1110490,0,0,dasht,,,"I'm very skeptical of this idea.  I don't mean to spread ""negative energy"" or flame but, may I be frank?<p>Walking it through:<p>Let's start with the straw-man that I'm a small single shop and don't want CC processing.  Cashierlive will <i>take</i> me as a customer for $50/month - but I can buy a robust cash register that will last years for less than that and I'll probably save more than $50/month using my own in-house inventory management system even if I wind up having to enter journal tape and receipt data into my PC manually.  On top of that, the used cash register I buy will likely be a more robust solution.<p>Suppose I'm that same dinky shop but now I want to add CC processing.  There already exists a competitive market for low-acquisition-cost, fee-based CC processing - just go into any corner liquor store in a big city.   I can either add a service fee to CC and debit card purchases, or set a minimum purchase price for card usage and adjust my retail prices slightly.  (Which is right depends on the nature of my products and my customers.)<p>Suppose I'm still a single shop but larger and more sophisticated.  I want integration of POS with inventory management.  I want CC processing.  If I'm setting up for the first time to achieve that state I have to drop a decent chunk of change on HW and I damn sure want to have competing offers from CC processing companies.  Yet with cashierlive I'm locked into cashierlive's CC processing partners and any subsidy I'm getting on software or hardware looks like chump change in my larger budget.<p>The higher up the chain my business goes, the less attractive it is to (a) trust cashier live to protect my data;  (b) trust cashier live to to remain in business;  (c) trust cashier live to keep up with me in feature demands;  (d) trust cashier live to avoid massive attacks on their servers;  (e) trust that cashier live isn't down when I need to collect reports to file taxes; etc.<p>As a larger, more sophisticated customer - all those unknowns and risks greatly outweigh the relatively modest cost savings.<p>What about if I have multiple stores and am really attracted to the cross-site inventory management features?  Or like the ""access anywhere"" features for reporting.  At that point I'm sophisticated and flush enough that I can probably do better on my own - with bespoke software if I have to.<p>The low end of the market has plenty of reasons to find a simpler, more robust, cost competitive solution in existing markets.  The high end has every reason to run, not walk, from the kind of centralization of control and purchasing decisions that cashier live implies.<p>Cashier Live as a business seems to be essentially a value-added broker of CC processing services.  In that sense, it competes directly against the IT/POS consultant that my local accounting firm uses - the guy who actually comes into my shop and connects devices and strings wire.  Cashier Live is competing against <i>that</i> with on-line training videos and a help line - which is weak.   It's especially weak since, regardless, I still have to hire my local accounting firm.<p>Swapping out my ""small business perspective"" hat for my ""engineer with VC sensitivities"" hat: the centralization of data and services proposed by cashier live are just nuts.  It creates a massive and precarious single point of failure in direct proportion to the number of customers it acquires and the number of transactions it processes.   Asked to comment on the technology I would be conscious bound to speak out against it.  Asked to invest, I would have to decline.<p>BUT: HOW TO FIX IT!!!!<p>Web-based POS, inventory mgt. etc. is a fine idea provided (as noted in other comments) it's hardened against interruptions of net connectivity and avoids centralization.   All of the problems I listed above have to do with the unreasonable centralization of cashier live's model:  centralization of choice about CC processing agents;  centralization of choice about software features;  centralization of choice about database structure, backup-policy, etc.; .....<p>I think cashier live would have a chance if it polished up its code, released it under GPL, partnered with accounting firms instead of directly CC processing firms, and went into the premium fee support / consulting business while learning to franchise sales to put qualified reps on the floor of customer's shops to hook things up.<p>I have a <i>hunch</i> that cashier live grew out of doing some bespoke work and then trying to turn that into a commodity service ""web 2.0 style"".   Perhaps the better course would be to learn how to do bespoke work at scale, for a premium.<p>It would even be OK for cashier live to resell <i>hosting</i> for the web service provided that hosting weren't centralized and the customer had the option of finding their own hosting.",1265668299

(Some ideas to get you going: make it get smarter the more I use it.  Send me actionable info -- ""you've only gone to the gym once this week -- on weeks when you go at least 2x, your avg. BG is 20 points lower"".  Make me want to show off when I'm doing well, and indirectly apply social pressure to do better when I'm not.)<p>And you don't even have some basic details right.  You have nothing for exercise!  That's huge!  And the glycemic load, fat content, and amount of fiber in a food is as important as how much carbohydrate is in it.  Knowing how many carbs are in a piece of pizza isn't that useful (and there are a million other tools to do that already --including ones built directly into insulin pumps and blood glucose meters, and mobile apps).  If you don't know that you should take very different insulin amounts and patterns when eating a serving of Skittles, pizza or brown rice even though they have the same amount of CHO, you don't know enough to help.<p>There really isn't anything in the app that shows you've even read the wikipedia page about diabetes.  Sorry if that sounds harsh but every part of the app reflects it, and so as a diabetic it's hard not to find the whole thing condescending.  In addition to nothing on exercise, your app doesn't do anything with A1C/fructosamine, C-peptide tests, cholesterol, T4, etc., all of which are more useful to compare to blood glucose readings than BP, and as important to track over time.  Have you even heard of A1C?  They run commercials on TV reminding diabetics to get it checked regularly all the time.<p>Maybe my expectations are too high, or maybe yours are.  If you're going for super-simple, it needs to be a lot more simple, a bit more useful, and a lot more memorable.  If you're going for sophisticated, you've got a whole lot of work to do and probably need to get diabetes and/or a medical degree first.  But you need to make a choice: are you going for power users, or casual users?  Even if you got the medical details right, there's a basic market fit problem here, and a lack of stickyness, as mentioned above.  There are way too many competitors not to have the market fit be <i>solid</i> and have some very unique twist.<p>In general, if you're selling a specialty product, you need to know more about the specialty than the average user.  I've created some very successful software for the specialty $foo market.  But I was a $foo-ographer for 10 years, everybody in the $foo world knows my name, I've been blogging about $foo for 5 years, etc.<p>As a white guy, would you start a line of hair-care products for black people?  Open up a Thai restaurant even though you've never been to Thailand, don't even eat Thai food, and there are already 3 good Thai restaurants in the neighborhood -- but you heard that lemongrass is somehow involved?  Probably not, so why do this?  DON'T FAKE THE FUNK.<p>Oh, final pet peeve.  For the love of Pete don't say stuff like ""CareLogger makes it possible to share your logged information with your physician simply by printing off the desired records.""  No.  Being able to print a web page is not a feature.  I can just take my glucose meter to the doctor and they can pull my data directly from it into their computer!  Don't mention stuff that makes you look bad, even to downplay it.  If you can't compete on a feature, don't mention it.  Sell the features you <i>do</i> have, preferably the ones competitors don't.",1265666932

I think the laptop/desktop portion of Apple still attracts a certain individual that typically requires things to be well designed and stable.
