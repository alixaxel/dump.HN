There are plenty of parts that <i>could</i> make a profit, but we prefer the government providing stuff for free instead. For example, if the federal government were allowed to hold copyrights, it could make good money licensing all sorts of military photographs (WW2 photography alone would be worth quite a bit). And the rate for interstate highway travel that the market would bear is probably higher than $0.00/mile. Instead photographs are public domain, and highways are free.",1267253796

In general, they are different from the dirt beneath our feet and the ores that we mine from our planet's crust. Likewise, they are much different than the Moon, Mars, and other planets' crusts. Asteroids are much more metal-rich, like the core of the Earth, Moon, Mars and any other planet, and unlike their crusts. The asteroids are normally not as enriched in oxides, silicates, and the other lighterweight elements that floated up to dominate a planetary crust. Many asteroids are like a mixture of a planetary metal core plus a crust plus the mantle in between. Some are entirely like a core or a mantle or a crust, having come from a large parent body which was broken up. In most asteroids, free metal is abundant in the mix, and often dominant. This free metal can be used without any further industrial processing.</i><p><a href=""http://www.permanent.com/a-overvw.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.permanent.com/a-overvw.htm</a>",1267252079
