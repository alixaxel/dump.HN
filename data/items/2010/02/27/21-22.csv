Female circumcision is a statement by a culture that sex should not be desired by girls. The one-child rule is a statement by a culture that quality of life for its existing members is more important than quantity of life for its hypothetical ones. In either case, individual members of the culture may disagree, but then will be forced to conform to the culture's mores anyway—<i>that</i> is what we find repulsive about those policies.<p>As long as, on an individual level, people are free to choose their own utility function (as long as that function doesn't stop <i>other</i> people from choosing and partaking in <i>their</i> utility functions), then nothing else really matters on a grand-er scale.

After looking throught the docs and some blog posts it wasn't clear to me how to hook up apache and virtualenv. Do you source in the env via the activate script? I feel like I'm missing something.
