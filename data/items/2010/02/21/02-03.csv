It can easily be observed that the type of Y is (P -> P) -> P, that is, a proposition implying itself implies itself. Since the first part is obviously a tautology, this reduces to a proof of ""for all P, P is true"". Hooray, anything is possible! This is closely related to Löb's theorem, Gödel's incompleteness theorems, and all those other fun things.<p>The net result is that there is a fundamental equivalence between true theorems that cannot be proven (cf. Gödel) and correct programs that cannot be shown to halt (cf. Turing).",1266720971

It's talking about Flash on desktop/laptop Macs, and as far as I can tell, the vast majority of the problems with that are Adobe's fault.<p>I hate that Apple has made its phone OS a walled garden. I won't buy one, and I won't develop for it, but this article doesn't really have anything to do with it.",1266717893

Touch-down does nothing (since it could be a click or a drag), and a drag scrolls the page.  The only thing they currently send through is a mouse-up, which seems to be sent through as a click.<p>In pseudocode:<p><pre><code>  on touch:\n    # do nothing yet\n\n    if drag:\n      scroll page\n    else: # was just a tap\n      send click to page\n</code></pre>\nGranted, this is just how Mobile Safari is handling things, but how else could Mobile Safari handle things?",1266717808

Your users are almost certain to have it.<p>Most of the conversations of the evilness of flash are limited to the HN sort of audience. I don't think that the internet audience at large really cares about it all that much.<p>If the features end up being really useful and you decide you hate Flash, you can revisit it and write it in something else later.<p>If the features end up not getting used, then you saved yourself a bunch of time on a feature that didn't end up being a big deal.",1266717782

His solution is that biological stuff just has these special properties, that's a ""brute fact"" about biological stuff and it's not true of silicon stuff.  And I think most philosophers of mind (who are, by and large, nonprogrammers) think that's too 'magical' to be true.<p>In fact a very popular idea now in philosophy is that consciousness is (in some sense) a fundamental physical property, and when physical things are arranged in the right way, they become conscious like us or any other animal.  And the proper arrangement of particles to invoke these high-level conscious properties must help organisms survive, or else it'd be unlikely that we have them.  And so machines structured the right way can probably be conscious too.",1266717697

Look to known human biases and see if you are falling to any of them. See if anyone is confident enough that they will put their money where their mouth is and bet on it succeeding if done as described. If you're still confident, build it ( note that lack of immediate success may not prove the idea is a bad one - maybe implementation or marketing).<p>You want to know if your model is a good model of reality then you need to test it against reality - but actually trying it might be the easiest way first, depending on what the idea is.",1266717616
