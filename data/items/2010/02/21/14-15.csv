Scientists expected the bottom of the lines to be closer together than the top, but the opposite was found to be true.  The bottom of the lines was 8.2 inches further apart than the top.  Several theories were put forth to explain the reasoning behind this, but all failed to account for the large discrepancy from the expected results.<p>This was my favorite theory:\n<i>One central tenet of Teed's philosophy held that the earth is a hollow rock shell, and we live and walk on the inside surface of this shell. The entire universe, which is mostly an illusion caused by gravic and levic rays and light, lies within this shell. This complicated view was called the cellular cosmogony, the earth-cell theory or the Koreshan cosmogony.</i>",1266763548

Every bill these days, after it goes through the congressional meat grinder, comes out as a spineless piece of pork, and unless a magazine like the Economist (who ironically refuses to compute the economics of health care in this article), can point this out, then they, in my opinion, have lost the authority to report.",1266763480

The amount of doctors produced by our medical schools has remained nearly constant for more than a decade, and new openings add only about 100 doctors per year (about 1 school per year). We need to either pay primary care doctors more money to draw doctors in from the specialties, add a lot more medical schools, or somehow use technology to make health care much more efficient.

1140556,comment,1140486,1140486,0,0,grellas,,,"What the article calls ""ungovernable"" is what the U.S. political founders called ""checks and balances"" - good or bad, the system has functioned as it has for a long time now and nothing has happened in recent times to call its viability into question.<p>As far back as the 1830s, de Tocqueville made a fascinating study of why a stable democracy had arisen in the wake of the American revolution of the 1770s while, in contrast, the French revolution of just a few years later had led to mass slaughter and the guillotine. In significant part, he found that the difference lay in the massing of power that in France had gone unchecked, leading the people to fall under the sway of their immediate, unchecked passions and causing disastrous results.<p>In politics, there are reasons to check unlimited power and the U.S. system of law and politics is fundamentally premised on this (that is why there are, among other things, three co-equal branches of government, a federal/state division of power, a bicameral legislature, and, ultimately, a constitution whose main function is to prevent the rise of an overweening central authority).<p>One can of course question this and advocate for a stronger central authority and for the abrogation of the various checks and balances (or even pure traditions, such as the filibuster) but it is a bit tendentious to say that a system has suddenly become ""ungovernable"" simply because you wish it did not stand in the way of your immediate agenda. It has, after all, been but a very few years since many of these same sources were touting the filibuster as the last, great bastion of liberty when it was being used by a then-minority party to block judicial appointments seen as unfavorable to their cause. One's arguments are always stronger if they are principled and not tied to the exigencies of the moment, as those advanced here appear to be.",1266761396
