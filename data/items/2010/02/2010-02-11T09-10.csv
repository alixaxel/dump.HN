(I'm a new grad from Case Western, and I'm really good at learning languages and systems I don't know quickly, and I have at least a passing familiarity with tons of topics.) I am curious though: the requirements mention ""deep knowledge of a compiled language"". What part? The language, the compiler, the libraries, the generated code, or something else? I've got the first two in spades for C (and Objective-C, but somehow I doubt you're using that much) and can figure out most anything about the third and fourth in a few minutes with the right book or Google query.",1265879117

I love this community because you're smart and ambitious, but we need to have a talk.<p>The Winter Olympics (& World Cup) are coming up.  If we're lucky and live beyond our life expectancy, it's one of maybe 20 we could possibly see.  20.  That's how short life is.<p>A long time ago I was getting into film direction and saw a contest in town for 8mm film shorts.  So I wrote a screenplay, gathered eight of my friends together, and in one long day, we shot it.  Weeks later when it came back from the labs, I took it to a guy I knew (who was also involved in putting the contest on) who had a projector.  I was so excited.  I was so proud of what I had done.  I began rehearsing, in my mind, answers to such questions as, ""How did you achieve such genius with so little background in film?"", ""What was your inspiration?"", etc.  The projector spun the film; I held my breath.  We couldn't see anything; I hadn't used enough light. (In all my books on film direction, lighting an 8mm didn't come up.) The guy said, as he walked me out, ""But you had fun making it right?""  I took it almost as a taunt.  I thought, ""Fuck fun.  I didn't want fun.  I wanted that fucking film to turn out.""<p>So you're on Hacker News because you like technology?  That technology is going to be obsolete in <i>at most</i> a few Winter Olympics from now.  You're on HN because you have a startup?  If you have a great idea and you execute well with a great team... the odds are not even remotely in your favor.  Ask anyone in the business.  Not even remotely.<p>Today when I think back, do you know what I remember from that 8mm film I made?  How much fun my friends and I had making it.  We had a blast.  That day is a wonderful, glorious memory. Whether or not the film turned out was always irrelevant.<p>Everything you think and love and see and know has an expiration date on it.  20 Olympics -- at most -- if you're lucky.  And when you're old and smoking that last cigar (because fuck it) and you close your eyes, what will you remember?  Do you know?  I'll tell you.  Not the film.  You won't even remember what the film was about.  No, you'll remember the day you shot it.  ""But you had fun making it?"" Did you?  It can sound like a taunt, but it's not.  It's everything.  God, be ambitious.  Be smart.  Good for you.  But have fun. Most of all, have fun.<p>Laugh, HN.  Let your hair down.  Have sex.  Drink wine from the bottle.  Dance like madman.  Have fun.  For the love of God.  You have 20 and it's all you'll ever have.  Have fun.",1265879106

1117264,comment,1114122,1114196,0,0,pmccool,,,"I disagree. The list you mention is part of the definition of ""terrorist act"". The definition of ""terrorist act"" starts by saying:<p>terrorist act"" means an action or threat of action where:
(a) the action falls within subsection (2) and does not fall within subsection (2A)...<p>The list of things you cite is from subsection (2). However, subsection (2A) reads:
(2A)
Action falls within this subsection if it:
(a) is advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action; and 
(b) is not intended: 
(i) to cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or 
(ii) to cause a person's death; or 
(iii) to endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking the action; or 
(iv) to create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.<p>It's pretty clear to me that this sort of action falls within both subsection (2) (as you pointed out) and subsection (2A). The latter means it wouldn't be within the definition of ""terrorist act"".",1265878881
