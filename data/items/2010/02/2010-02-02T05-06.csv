In making that claim, his problem is that N.K. is a communist dictatorship, and he can't find any way to spin that as right-wing.

No mention about whether actions count more than words, or how that worked in years past, when there was plenty of racism and plenty of mentions of communism.<p>A few notes: <i>All</i> dictatorships are militaristic in some important sense. That's because all dictatorships crush dissent, and sometimes you need a tank when all else fails.<p>As for racism: Stalin launched numerous pogroms against the Jews (and, in a nice Stalinist touch, put a jew in charge of the operations).

1094389,comment,1092535,1093906,0,0,Coax,,,"Point taken regarding the geographic element, your argument makes sense.<p>But I'm still having trouble understanding how your gripe with the other accelerators is legitimate....<p>In founding YC you came up with a wonderful, innovative model for birthing startups.  Kudos for that.  You invented a whole new paradigm of investment; that's f-ing cool.  But whenever an entrepreneur comes up with an brilliant new way to do business, other entrepreneurs follow.  I struggle to think of an instance where a company created a new industry and other folks didn't join.  And I don't begrudge the followers; they are part of a dynamic that is central to the innovative beast that is American capitalism.<p>Perhaps other entrepreneurs follow because a single company can rarely support an entire industry.  Perhaps they follow because they think they can do things subtly (or radically) different to improve the model.  I'm not sure the reason is terribly important.  The point is, inventing an industry niche does not give you a monopoly right on that niche ad infinitum.<p>The internet space is full of examples.  Aliweb was (arguably) the first commercial search engine.  I remember trying it back in 1994.  At the time, it seemed damn cool.  Then, soon after, I heard about a new search engine called Lycos, so I tried that.  It was similar to Aliweb--I thought I slightly preferred the Lycos results, but I wasn't sure.  Lycos begot Altavista; Altavista begot Dogpile; Dogpile begot Google.  Each new search engine was doubtlessly dependent on its predecessors.  And each new search engine had no obvious new innovation--changes were subtle, usually hidden under the hood.<p>I don't buy the argument that entrepreneurs should be frowned upon for entering a new industry without a radical new twist.  Begrudging folks who are making subtle changes to your model seems petty.  YC will, for the foreseeable future, have the name brand and network to attract better talent than all other accelerators.  That--not a universal monopoly--is a proper reward for being the first mover.",1265088928
1094388,comment,1093223,1093223,0,0,babycakes,,,"I'm unaware of a truly great basic circuits book, but if you get one, choose one for electrical engineers.  Physicists flip the direction of current flow, which is mathematically equivalent but confusing.  Once you learn basic circuits, Sedra and Smith's ""Microelectronic Circuits"" is an awesome text for analog transistor design.  Lots of people use Razavi's ""Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits"" for advanced analog design, but I found the text full of contrived examples that don't teach you practical design principles.  Most people don't go that far (senior-level EE electives), so you'll probably be fine stopping at Sedra and Smith.<p>Hennessy and Patterson's ""Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach"" is a comprehensive look at principles of computer architecture, but if you want to actually design the digital circuits beneath them, you'll want something more specialized.  I used Wakerly's ""Digital Design Principles and Practices.""  In retrospect, I found it lacking on different types of arithmetic circuits, but it was good enough for me.  Keep in mind that most large-scale modern circuits will be designed using hardware description languages, so you may want to invest in a Verilog or VHDL text to continue your study but only after you have come to understand digital design.  (HDLs require a different type of thinking than sequential programming languages.)  AFAIK, Verilog is more common in industry, whereas VHDL is more common on government and university projects.<p>Good luck!",1265088921

My theory on his axis of evil theory is that it comes from the same opposition to totalitarianism and internationalism. I think he wants to believe in internationalism also. The UN (which was never intended to be a guardian of democracy, human rights or such things) was failing. It would never 'liberate' Iraqi, Afghanis, Burmese, North Koreans or anyone else. So, he turns to the US for this job with, I think, the hope that this will eventually result in a paradigm shift empowering internationalism in general.

He supports liberation. Iraqis largely see the coalition as occupiers, not liberators (apart from the Kurds who never saw themselves as part of Saddam's Iraq) regardless of their views of the previous regime. Accepting that Iraq was not in fact liberated is accepting that liberation is not possible. His solidarity is delusional.

(Seriously, folks, if you value conversion optimization, I want you to play five minutes of WoW and five minutes of any other MMORPG, and take notes on what happens.  WoW will drag you around by the nose.  WoW will point you in the direction of the next thing to do.  WoW <i>will</i> show you success in those five minutes, even if you're terrible at what you're doing.

(It took them years to learn this, but they eventually go around to it.)<p>3)  Make it simple.  Then, make it simpler. WoW is one of the most complicated pieces of engineering the world has ever known, but six year olds can pick up and play it.<p>4)  People will put up with any amount of drudgery if you give them small, frequent, random rewards for doing so.  This is in fact so powerful I'm kind of scared of doing it.<p>5)  If people are bringing their boyfriends into your product so that they can spend more time together, that is probably a good sign you have reached mass market success.<p>6)  Monthly.  Billing.  Minor discounts for cashflow in advance.<p>7)  High quality visual design can be made rot-proof by using iconic representations, bright colors, and timeless aesthetics.

No amount of open source linkfests are going to budge that link from the top of the search results.  As a consequence Chrome will always be exactly what Google wants (or allows) it to be and nothing more.  If Google decides at some future point that ad blockers are eating into its bottom line then the ad blockers will disappear, end of story.  I am sure it will be couched in some pseudo-technical justification (c.f. why adblock won't work on Chrome) but the end result will be the same.
