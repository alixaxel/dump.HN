They also tend to get emotional. Arguing reliably kills sales. What to do? One trick is to try to organize a large meeting so their peers do the work for you. The more people in the room, the more likely there is someone very smart and respected and cares (about bugs and about the given code), can diagnose an error (to counter arguments it's a false positive), has been burned by a similar error, loses his/her bonus for errors, or is in another group (another potential sale).""",1265857147

It's not even federated as of yet (not that facebook sees a need for their users to communicate outside of their network).  Not federated means things like [twitterspy](<a href=""http://dustin.github.com/twitterspy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dustin.github.com/twitterspy/</a>) won't work.<p>They also don't pass many stanza types through.

Everything he says recasts the situation in terms of a problem that management consulting can fix with simple solutions.<p><i>It's not the recession, it's poor salesmanship.</i>  A problem that can be solved by a consultant.  A massive pan-industry collapse in sales, inventory, credit, and utilization could not be fixed by three ring binders and training classes.<p><i>Lack of vendor financing.</i>  A problem that can be solved by a consultant tightening the screws, backed up by a long list of companies that were helped.  This is survivor bias.  The successes are selected for companies whose vendors are idiotic enough to finance their customers AND lucky enough to survive the folly.  It also relies on the presence of other parties who are willing to buy mis-rated bonds and do factoring (loaning against small business receivables).  Both of these are being choked off, and may well come to an apocalyptic end as the financial collapse continues.  Whereupon all his ""saved"" clients will blow up.<p><i>""Getting good people is 100 times more difficult than conventional wisdom says. The fact is, you’re going to deal with a lot of mediocre people, no matter how hard you try.""</i>  In other words, your employees are sabotaging your company, because all employees do this.

I'll trust the author's account of his experience using Adobe products, and the kludginess of modal dialog boxes is generally accepted, but in my opinion, he got everything else wrong.  As a user gripefest about Adobe products, I'd accept it, but as a a Hacker News link, I want to see some insightful generalizations.<p>Also, I'll add that the first article he links to (on Aza Raskin's blog) condemns modality without sufficient feedback and explains how hidden state causes users to make dangerous errors.  How that applies to modal dialog boxes is not explained.  Modal dialog boxes, if anything, rub the user's nose in the application state.  If he had taken Aza Raskin's warnings about hidden state to heart, he would have known what's wrong with allowing users to suppress error messages about missing or invalid data.<p>(His suggestions would be acceptable in an IDE, but in a commercial application for non-programmers... he shouldn't be so sure the modal dialog isn't the best solution.  Putting error messages in a status bar or other predictable place might be acceptable, but only if it's impossible for the user not to notice that something is wrong.<p>(Programmers, probably because of ego or professional pride, tend to take a lot more responsibility for their usage errors than non-programmers.  Not coincidentally, they tend to design UIs that cause non-programmers grief.  Annoyed users are better than users going through the stages of grief, because when they get to Anger it's going to be directed at you.)<p>The second post he links to is just a list of ways modal dialog boxes can be abused or done poorly.  For example, modal dialogs may contain poorly formatted text, or have redundant buttons, or poorly labeled buttons, or buttons that appear active but really aren't.  They may have error messages that can't be copy and pasted.  In other words, it's just a checklist of mistakes programmers should avoid when writing dialog boxes.  Most apply to GUI widgets of any kind (poorly formatted text?  c'mon) and only a few apply specifically to modal dialogs.<p>So where's the beef?  I've written and deployed GUI applications to real users, and I was hoping to see something here I could make use of in the future.",1265854358
