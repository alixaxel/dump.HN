If I am on a platform where Arial looks OK, it should already be my default sans-serif font, right? Currently, I have Arial installed, but I've set my default sans-serif font to DejaVu Sans Mono, which (subjectively) looks better on freetype. But most sites force Arial.

Can you cite a single source showing that laziness is not a contributing factor to poverty?<p>Also, I never claimed it was a complete picture of what causes poverty. I claimed it was one possible cause of the <i>correlation</i> between parent and child poverty. This debunks Bowle's claim that a correlation between parent and child poverty implies hard work could not be a cause of poverty. It may or may not be, but his statistic proves absolutely nothing unless he can also show that laziness is not hereditary. Other things, e.g. bad luck, might also cause poverty, but would not be correlated between parent and child.<p>Incidentally, the same research about why I might prefer a ""hard work"" theory also shows why you would emotionally prefer a ""it's not their fault"" theory.

Was the policy of TC relative to ""compensations"" made very clear to Daniel when he started ? If it was, then Daniel has no excuse since he transgressed clearly stated rules. If the rules were only implicit and assumed to be known and followed by authors then Daniel may be excused by his age since his education is not yet complete and he still needs time to mature.<p>The knowledge of good and bad builds up and refines itself with age through experiences. Note that a lot of adults are still confused about this limit in some domains like for instance exchanging and using unpayed copies of films and musics.<p>The integrity and reputation of TC is in play here so the prompt and radical reaction was legitimate. The communication was also a good move to make clear that such behavior is not in line with TC ethics. \nWhether the collaboration with Daniel should have been terminated or not depends on his responsibility.<p>Turning public about this incident is a clear error of Daniel which may be another demonstration of his inexperience or bad advice given to him. This new error would have remained unnoticed if TC didn't advertise it.<p>My impression is that TC behaves with Daniel as if he was an adult, which he clearly isn't. This makes it much more difficult for Daniel to learn from his errors because the back burn is quite devastating and probably excessive.<p>I hope Daniel manage to learn the lessons, and I hope TC used this opportunity to learn some lessons too.<p>So in conclusion it is still not clear if Daniel is the only one to blame here. However the aim shouldn't be to know who to blame, but to make sure that everyone managed to learn what has to be learned and correct his behavior in consequence.",1265375813

Even though both NeXTStep and NT represented full, proper 32-bit ""modern"" operating systems and were both invented in the early 90s it took until 2001/2002 for both to come of age as consumer grade operating systems (NeXTStep as OS X, NT as Windows XP). In the meantime MS put forth an interim solution (Windows 9x) that was still suitable for consumer-grade PC hardware, resulting in a continuation of Windows market dominance and billions of dollars in profits for Microsoft. In contrast, NeXT took the intellectual high road, stubbornly refusing to compromise its vision of the future, resulting in massive financial losses, being forced to lay off 2/3 of its employees, and a long, slow slide into bankruptcy and irrelevancy before being acquired by Apple (which had stretched the decrepit Mac OS to its breaking point).<p>Had NeXT maintained a little more pragmatism and a little less stubborn pride it's possible that they could have become the next Apple or the next Microsoft, rather than merely a juicy intellectual property morsel for the real players in the industry to pick up and take advantage of.",1265375430

Every article that ends up on here ends up here because someone (whether the author or not) has deliberately submitted it, and other people have deliberately upvoted it. This is true whether or not the person who submitted it was the author, and whether or not they were asked by the author if they would be willing to submit the article. Who are you to declare one set of articles ""natural"" and the other ""unnatural""?<p>I think you need to get off your puritanical high horse about ""keeping HN pure"". You're doing more harm than good. So far, the main HN problem I see with ""canvassing"" or ""voting rings"" or whatever other cabalistic conspiration theory you think up, is the fact that you're polluting HN with these pointless finger-pointing exercises.<p>There's far more a problem of awesome posts getting zero upvotes than of crappy posts getting too many.
