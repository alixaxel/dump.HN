I have been a member here for a few months and only <i>very</i> recently figured out how to intentionally pull up ""the front page"" (I'm quick like that).  I typically click on the ""new"" option and refresh that several times during my visit.  Then I read what gets my interest.  I'm not much of a crowd-follower and never have been.  It really doesn't mean much to me if something is ""popular"".  So what?  Lots of things that are popular are pure dreck -- which is apparently the basis for why the voting system is being tweaked to begin with.<p>Off the top of my head, I don't know of a comparable site with comparable size which has tackled a similar problem.  It seems to me HN is a victim of its own success in that these problems apparently arise out of how much traffic/membership has grown.  Either the people that run it will learn and grow and adapt or it will hit a fail wall and seriously degrade.  I've left some sites which hit that wall and which I felt were no longer worth participating in.  In the cases I know of, a huge limiting factor was the head honcho.  My hope is that the experiments being done here will yield good results, resolve the problem(s) that inspired them and HN can go on to new, grander levels of success.<p>Oft quoted remark in some forum I used to go to:  ""Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.""   My hope is that HN continues to have goals other than just ""growth"".  Presumably, these irritating experiments are being done in the name of keeping some of the qualities which got HN here to begin with and are a search for a means to keep the baby but dump the bath water.<p>Here is to hoping it all works out.",1265335153

He is not claiming that TCP is bad, but rather that it is too low-level.  i.e. One wants an application protocol (e.g. HTTP, SMTP, IMAP) rather than a transmission protocol (e.g. TCP).<p>The HTTP verbs should be sufficient for email, so why not leverage them?<p><i>It's not yet clear that people prefer tags to folders. After all, monkeys don't expect a banana to be in two boxes at once.</i><p>Heh, dare I reply?  Tags can be used as pigeonholes, and this can be enforced if desired.  But why?  Tags are so much more useful because they are <i>not</i> pigeonholes.<p>Here is a classic example:<p>Does my app config go in a system directory or an app directory or a config directory?  the executables? the daemon? the log files?<p>The classic approach is to put system-level config files under /etc, log files under /var/log, executables and daemons in various locations, etc.  Some newer approaches (HomeBrew, GoboLinux, etc) keep everything organized per-application.<p>Instead, keep every file in the global folder / namespace.  Tag the executables as exe, the log files as log, config as cfg, and also tag everything with the app's name.  Possibly the version, etc.<p>A file is uniquely identified by its tags and its name.  Any combo can be used, so long as it doesn't already exist.<p>You don't have to make painful decisions about the unique place in the tree that a piece of information should exist.  Just tag it appropriately and move on.  The tag system could even create an optimal concrete hierarchy based on tag and tag association metrics if needed.<p><i>But the server will have to know it to send it. Granted, IMAP is for receiving, and SMTP is for sending, but something in the chain has to know MIME.</i><p>I'm not sure if this is GoF, but this sounds like the classic gateway pattern.

That's a fun definition to smear someone with, but is not useful in understanding very many real phenomena. Faith is much better defined as something like ""acting on the truth of a statement that you can not (effectively) 100% prove""; note it does not preclude having a Bayesian probability of greater than 0, it is simply what you act on. When I sit in a chair, I can not 100% prove it will not collapse on me (after all, I have sat in chairs that collapsed on me and my Bayesian probability that a generic chair will support me can not be 100%), but I have faith that it will not; that is, I <i>act</i> as if it will not collapse.<p>When presented with a perpetual motion device, I can have faith that it will not work. Thanks to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, my Bayesian confidence in that belief is quite high, so it is not as if my faith is stepping out on a limb. But I have not <i>proved</i> that the perpetual motion machine won't work by actually examining it and finding the flaw, I simply have very-well-founded faith that such a flaw exists. Faith is a perfectly appropriate word here.<p>(I parenthesized ""effectively"" up there to avoid a massive and irrelevant discussion of exactly what 100% means, though it still pokes through. But is interesting to note that since reaching 100% confidence is very difficult, ""faith"" comes up in virtually every decision you make.)",1265334862

The approach of the article ""git from the bottom up"" is that one needs to understand this in order to use it, rather than being able to understand it in terms of the UI.\nTaking a lateral step towards the ease-of-adoption and learning of a tool, there's an intriguing aspect of git that I want to articulate further:<p><i>To understand part of git, you must first understand all of it.</i><p>Several aspects of git are interconnected; some design decisions don't make sense in isolation; and you need to know the detailed and apparently incidental behaviour of some commands in order to be able to use them. It's an <i>expert tool</i>.<p>As an ideal (perhaps unrealizable), a tool has a learning curve, with a series of ""closed"" subsets of functionality, such that each subset is complete in itself. Learn a subset, and you are a master of that aspect. (I'm using ""closed"" not in the strict mathematical sense of the results of operations being in the domain of their operands, but to mean that you don't need to go outside that subset). It's a similar concept to minimizing coupling between modules.<p>e.g. you can play UT without knowing about alternate fire; you can using basic reg exps without knowing all the weird clever stuff; you can write C in C++. Languages especially have this quality - you can write procedural code in an OO language, you can use one library without using all the libraries.<p>Git doesn't do this.<p>As an example, if you want to change the message of a commit, you need to create a new commit with the new message. This immutability is important (I infer) so that other instances of the repository can remain in sync (the new commit will have a different hash from the old one (with a very high probability), because the message is different). Thus, the apparently simple operation of ""changing a message"" is interconnected with the distributed nature of the tool.<p>If you want to change the message of the <i>first</i> commit (at the root of the DAG), it is more complex. First you 'change' the message of that first commit, via making a copy (as above) - but the rest of the DAG is still pointing to the old root, not your new one. Therefore, you <i>rebase</i> (disconnect and reattach a node) the child from the old root to the new root. Finally, <i>rebase</i> does not actually disconnect and reattach - it makes copies (immutability again). You haven't changed the old DAG, but created a new one.<p>Changing a message is not as simple as one might expect.<p>An additional problem is that the documentation (man pages) doesn't always define terms, and not always clearly. But they are obvious to someone who already knows how it works (and doesn't need the man pages, except for reference). BTW: I found that some terms are defined at the end of the options section (the definitions aren't always complete or unambiguous, but they help); and it's helpful to think of the <i>type</i> of the arguments (though the man pages don't use that term)<p>Please don't take this as a disparagement of git - it is an expert tool, tackling and solving some extremely difficult problems of a master. I understand it took Linus years of coping with the problem, and of having the brilliant example of <i>bitkeeper</i> before he could whip up git overnight. I've invested quite a bit of time to reach the (limited) understanding that I have so far, and each step teaches me more about the problems and solutions of serious distributed version control. It is complicated because the problem is complicated; and it <i>remains</i> complicated because a master already grasps the problem, and can cope with that complexity.",1265332788

He has told you what it will take for him to commit:<p><i>Now my co-founder wants to finish the semester of grad school and work remotely from Europe until we know the company is going to succeed. There's still too much risk, he says, to drop everything.</i><p>Here is your piece of it (at least according to what you have said):<p><i>I can deal with him staying in Europe, but I'm going fucking insane over the idea that I'm taking money from my own family (not wealthy), letting my personal debt balloon and my co-founder, who owns half the company, isn't even willing to drop what he's currently doing to do this as a full-fledged effort.</i><p>Suggestions:<p>1) Stop borrowing from family.<p>2) See if you can get funding from elsewhere which will allow you to pay back your relatives so you can get this monkey off your back.<p>3) Come to terms with the fact that right now you are way more committed than he is (and apparently always have been) and <i>either</i> lower your current commitment/investment level so this is no longer consuming you and destroying your finances <i>or</i> begin formulating a plan to cut him loose and go whole hog on your own.<p>4) If you go with the route of lowering your commitment level (by, say, taking a job so you have some personal income coming in), it only needs to last until he has graduated school.  If he won't make a commitment at that time, he will probably never make a commitment.  If you are unable to cut him loose now, pick a date that has a logical basis (such as ""3 months after he graduates"") by which time he needs to be on board full time or he needs to go.  You can let him know the deal and it can basically be his decision.<p>Again: You cannot control another human being.  You can only take measure of the situation and make decisions about your own choices.  Loyalty is a fine quality.  But if it isn't a two-way street, the expression for that is ""getting used"".  (Your description of the situation sounds an awful lot like some of the one-sided romantic relationships I have heard about.  I don't imagine you would appreciate the comparison, so I have deleted those remarks.)<p>Good luck with this.",1265332432
