2. How is Google Buzz better than Facebook? It's not.
3. What advantages does Google Buzz have over Facebook? That it lives in Gmail, but that's still not compelling. 
4. What advantages does Facebook have over Google? My friends/social graph algorithms/news feed
5. Did you see this coming? Sure, why wouldn't Google try this. They have 20,000 employees. This maybe took 5 weeks and 3 dev guys to hack up. 
6. What do you attribute Google’s recent string of AMAZING products
including: Chrome, Android, Nexus One and Buzz? Nexus One has a nice screen resolution. That's about the only good thing.",1265842767

1116174,story,,,3,1,lostintech,"Ask HN: What do you think of my startup idea ? China and Ebay related",,"The concept behind the idea, is well grounded. I will give you an example : I have been selling watches on ebay lately,
and i noticed that at least 95% of the questions i received from people were: ""Is this a original watch? or a knockoff copy?"",
but this phenomena extends to other products as well, such as perfumes (which are more dangerous when fake because they can contain harmful chemicals impurities), bags, handbadgs, and a ton more kind of goods. 
I was thinking to the relation this service could have with china, and its economic rise, and the fact that here fakes are almost legal.
Chine made promises to the international community when joined WTO in 2001. They told they were going to make counterfeits good illegal.
Some days ago i've asked a a smart woman who was selling counterfeit watches in Shenzhen LuoHu Commercial City :<p>Alberto Armandi: hey do u think china will ever put a stop on this ?
Chinese Woman : do u really want to know the truth ? 
Alberto Armandi : yes, of course.
Chinese Woman : i think China will never do that because we , and our economy depends heavily on that.<p>So given the Chinese economy growth, and the seriously diffused ""Chinese entrepreneurial mindset make money fast with counterfeit goods"", i think ebay will have to cope with a lot of those nasty stuffs in the future.
This gives room for this kind of service i think. 
I already bought domains : spotebayfake.com and fake-howto.com.
Both are related to keywords such as ""how to spot fake"", keywords that outputs some nice results if you look at volume of searches on google monthly.<p>It would not be billed with a monthly or whatever, subscription model, instead the customer would pay only for the item(s) he's interested to check. 
I was thinking to SMS because transactions will be vary small. I have to read how Paypal deals with micropayments. 
Regarding how the service would work, let's say you find a watch on ebay, like a Rolex watch, and you want to know it is fake or not, you come to our site and 
submit the request for investigation, i will check the object ( i know something about how to spot counterfeits and replicas, i am in china since 2005 ), and i will provide 
you an aswer, in terms of probability. All the process would not take more than 5 minutes, i do not think that real-time informations matter that much in this specifical case.
You will then pay let's say 1 USD to me for the information, and go on with your purchase or discard it.<p>here is a link to get a, not very precise, big picture of the market :<p>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&source=hp&q=how+to+spot+fake&aq=f&aqi=g10&oq=<p>There are also some forums on ebay :<p>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&newwindow=1&q=ebay+forums+how+to+spot+fake&aq=f&oq=&aqi=<p>What do you think ? is it worth implementing it ? let me know your feedback. it is precious.<p>Thanks so much in advance.

I now have a pretty technically credible* product with actual paying customers and everything.<p>The language I learned first was JavaScript because it's ubiquitous. There are a million tutorials to get you going.<p>A lot of JS tutorials suck, which is a disadvantage, but it gives you a pretty big confidence boost to be able to read a tutorial and think ""that's moronic, I know 6 other ways to do that which will work better"". Python tutorials tend to break out advanced/elegant/clever stuff really quickly which has the opposite effect.<p>I wrote a couple of little apps, then a prototype, then it felt like I knew enough to really get going.<p>I then picked up Python (actually Django) because the relative maturity of server side JS platforms isn't as good. Switching languages was easy.<p>The total time to get to that point was about 4 months (whilst working full time), but I had the advantage of living in a place where everything shut when it went dark at 7pm.<p>*Except for the bugs, and the scaling issues, and the bad design decisions I made early on. As far as I can tell I'm not the only person to have problems like this though, and refactoring is a good way to spend a plane ride.",1265839381

She's hustling and making money (and presumably having fun).  She can always learn to cook later if it strikes her fancy.<p>The idea of outsourcing your life makes a lot of sense if you spend a lot of time on petty outsourceable tasks and are a driven sort of person who can use every extra minute.<p>A lot of us don't fit that profile, and outsourcing more of our lives would just mean more time spent sitting on the couch or parked in front of the computer.  I'm probably better off mowing my own lawn and only watching five episodes of Breaking Bad this week instead of six.",1265839218
