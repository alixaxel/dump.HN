1133734,comment,1133277,1133386,0,0,tjogin,,,"HTML/CSS may seem so simple as to not even count as coding, to us coders, that is.<p>But consider the fact that many <i>coders</i> don't have the most basic grasp of design. Not even <i>really</i> fundamental things like alignment, proportions, which colors go well together, or even how to phrase a sentence so it makes sense to the user — which isn't even design, it's just <i>english</i>.<p>I think it's kind of a jerk move for coders to expect designers to like or care about coding, even really simple fundamental stuff, when many coders are notoriously lacking in the design or even <i>taste</i> departments.<p>Having said that, it is obviously a huge benefit for both coders and designers to at least know the basics of the other's trade.<p>One could even argue that you're not really a truly talented developer nor designer until you do; but, before we come down on designers, let's look at the state of design skills in the coding community.",1266482952

1133731,comment,1132987,1133147,0,0,jsz0,,,"This should be the long term goal of US security policy. Israel has been dealing with terrorism long enough to have developed an optimal strategy. I think the wars in Iraq & Afghanistan reflect that US intelligence and covert operations just weren't ready to deal with Islamic terrorism so we had to fall back to conventional warfare to prove a point. If there's anything good to come out of this at least we have even more proof that fighting conventional wars even on a relatively small scale is just too costly, destructive and ineffective even for a super power. Hopefully it gives the whole world less incentive to escalate into war. It seems as though over the generations we're heading in that direction. Wars are generally getting smaller and less deadly as technology actually allows them to become bigger and more deadly. That's some reason for optimism.",1266482776
1133729,comment,1133677,1133677,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Or it could be that Avatar's acting was nothing special.  The movie was gorgeous; the acting, ho-hum.  The characters were all playing archetypes, at some points it seemed like they were <i>overplaying</i> archetypes (Sam Worthington seemed to be trying a bit too hard to drive home that he was the ""dumb marine"" type, and Zoe Saldana switched between ""tender alien babe"" to ""tough alien warrior"" far too easily), and there was little in the storyline to draw out a Best Actor/Actress performance.<p>Reminds me of Titanic, which was also shut out of the Best Actor/Actress awards when everything was over.  12 years later, the acting for Titanic seems laughably bad.

Your are absolutely correct, most sites seem to originate in pre-2000.<p>Just two additional ideas:<p>For the problem you specified I did find a interface which gives you a day view of both destinations with the corresponding times on both sides, and colored backgrounds (green for good meeting times, yellow for too early or too late or midday and red for night) so that you can easily find out an optimal meeting time (I guess it was possible to add more timezones to it), however I cannot remember the site.<p>For the interface you created I guess it would be nice to add an analog clock over the input, which can be changed via dragging the hands to the specified time and the other clock updates it's time in real-time.",1266482020

Let's see :<p>""Small records with complex, well-defined, highly normalized relationships.""<p>Maybe, but not necessarily. Example? Call Data Records for a phone billing application. While there may be relationships in the inserted rows, even to other databases (i.e. customer information) the data stands pretty much on it's own. The challenge is to get floods of data into a single table, so that it can be later sliced and diced for billing purposes.<p>""The type of queries you will be running on the data is largely unknown up front.""<p>Excuse me? This is so very wrong. I don't even no where to start. <i>EVERY</i> good RDB application is designed in a way where (ideally) all queries are known up-front. If you have to guarantee response times (i.e. think of a cash withdrawal at an ATM) you absolutely <i>MUST</i> control the queries that run on the db. Ad-hoc analysing and reporting <i>MUST</i> be relegated to dedicated, possibly replicated databases.<p>""The data is long-lived: it will be written once, updated infrequently relative to the number of reads/queries, and deleted either never, or many years in the future.""<p>Mostly so, but absolutely not necessarily the case. I work on an application where the entire data is toasted after a couple weeks and in fact: today and yesterday would suffice.<p>""The database does not need round-the-clock availability (middle-of-the-night maintenance windows are no problem). 
Queries do not need to be particularly fast, they just need to return correct results eventually.""<p>This is so full of crap, I won't even get into it<p>""Data integrity is 100% paramount, trumping all other concerns, such as performance and scalability""<p>Yes, 100% integrity is paramount, but most certainly not at the cost of scalability, let alone performance.<p>Recently, methinks, there are a lot of proponents of new and improved data management capabilities, who see their little walled environment, but seem to have no whatsoever experience running databases in a real business.
