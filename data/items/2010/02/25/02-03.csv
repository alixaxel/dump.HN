Not really any personal contact, just a matter of business.<p>The second group would do the same, but would generally be friendly with the staff.  They seemed to stay a little longer than the above, but it's possible that I only think that because they were recognizable and friendly.<p>The third group were what I called ""squatters"".  They'd set up at a table like they owned it, and generally didn't care who they inconvenienced in the process.  The squatters tended to stay for hours, and tended to try to stretch their coffee dollar; buying drip and adding a lot of sugar and milk, or doing the same with espresso to make a ghetto latte.  More than once I found squatters who unplugged a grinder or a coffee machine to plug in their laptop, and then got ranted at when I informed them that I needed the outlet to provide service to others.<p>My experiences certainly don't prove anything, of course.",1267066622

These are students who, in the current scenario, need to first head over to US on a student or work visa, and then apply for YC funding.

In areas where unemployment is high, foreign nationals need only invest $500,000 to obtain residency.

In other words, the laws give prosecutors shall vast discretion that they can be applied in ways that are unfair and even ruinous to companies such as to deny them basic due process protections (and, of course, the Andersen conviction was ultimately overturned).<p>More broadly stated, when language is corrupted so that nothing is clear, everyone acts potentially at his peril because legal outcomes - that is, <i>punitive</i> legal outcomes that can harm or destroy lives - rest on the whim of enforcement authorities who have broad powers to punish based on vague criteria affording no checks on their power to abuse their discretion.

Well your branch in SVN is your domain, do what you want.<p>I think the main advantage is really for larger groups. Having 3000 branches in the linux repo would be unmanageable. Also, private branches are something SVN can't do to my knowledge. If I want to hack on a git repo without anyone knowing, it's easy.<p>But there's many advantages to GIT/Mercurial over SVN/* aside from the ""everyone has a repo"". I love git but currently use SVN due to legacy and keyword expansion at work and it's not that bad.",1267063574

Drama follows people like us everywhere.  Takes guts to put it out there, being sober today (I am, too).  Congrats.  A lot of writers tend to burn hard and crash, and I don't want to end up there, either.<p>To quote a friend of mine:  ""It's kind of a bumpy, unrewarding ride anyway. I don't recommend.

I've seen two people using them in that time and perhaps 10-20 cyclists total.<p>Owning a car and driving is too easy. Building some cycle lanes isn't encouraging people to get onto bikes - it just makes life easier for those who've already made the decision (and so don't need convincing). You'd need to make cars <i>less</i> desirable to have the effect you want, but even that ain't easy.. I didn't see people flocking to bikes when oil was $150 a barrel.",1267063325
