It's not the same thing.<p>I'm a math PhD. I've got 3 job offers in the pipeline, and I haven't even started actively looking [1].

Tenure, aka permanent lifetime employment with almost 100% flexibility in your work life is hard to get. Uh, yeah, jobs paying $500k/year are also hard to get.

That was started almost two years ago so we've worked on a variety of different types of projects since that initial study--from simple websites to high-availability, rich applications. Some have required more internal knowledge of Django than others, but I can't think of a time where Django itself was an impediment or a bottleneck.<p>With regards to time series...me too! I don't have enough data to make any statistically-backed claims, but anecdotally Django-based sprints do start off with a big bump in velocity, because you're handed a tremendous amount of functionality upfront via the framework itself, Admin CRUD, etc.. Once a team gets moving their velocities tend to stabilize, which is one of the reasons story points and velocities are such powerful estimation and forecasting tools.<p>That being said, C# teams seem to have larger standard deviations around their mean velocity. One thing I have noticed is that refactors tend to have differing impacts. Major refactor efforts and rearchitecting almost always noticeably hit the C# team's velocity much more so than the impact on the Python group. Having done refactoring and and rearchitecting in both environments, I tend to think it's a function of the syntactical overhead associated with the C# language.",1267104127

It took me an hour to get through the Hardy-Weinberg Equation and that was recently. I'm relying upon the fact that Tooby, Cosmides and Pinker among others do not respect Gould.\n<a href=""http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/CEP_Gould.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cogweb.ucla.edu/Debate/CEP_Gould.html</a><p>I see no special reason to rate Gould as an evolutionary biologist. As an essayist and polemicist, I rate him, and I'm as qualified to do so as anyone else. As a palaeontologist, I rate him because Harvard did. As an evolutionary biologist, ttbomk his contributions boil down to coining ""punctuauted equilibrium"" i.e. adaptation does not proceed always and everywhere at a uniform speed.<p>Why would I, currently ignorant as I am, read the work of someone who I do not trust to put science before ideology? If I ever reach a stage where I can say I'm <i>not</i> ignorant I'd obviosuly read Lewontin first.<p>Spandrels: Complexity that is not conserved as such but that arises as a consequence of some feature that is selected for. Thus any mutations that effect the spandrel but not the parent feature will have no selective advantage or disadvantage. As such the spandrel will decay or be repurposed in some adaptive fashion. It will not be conserved as such.<p>Male reproductive skew: How many calories does it cost me to deposit some sperm and then bugger off? How many does it cost a female to bring a child to term? How many more to bring it to sexual maturity and/or independence? Given the diference in  minimum investment, and the 1:1 sex ratio that arises as a consequence of Fisher's Principle a very small advantage in mating will have a much greater effect on males than females in terms of number of surviving offspring, and will as such be more strongly selected for.<p>Alternatively, why do we have males and females rather than interfertile hermaphrodites? Given that we do, why do we have so many males when a tenth or a hundredth as many would do to fertilise all the females?<p>Apologies for the late reply.",1267103689
