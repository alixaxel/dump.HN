Both are types of science where you get only one effective shot at predicting a given event because once an event passes you can no longer predict it.<p>Which is harder is hard to tell. Climate science has to deal with far more variables (current models still measure their grids in terms of miles, AFAIK) and the data is radically inferior to economic data. On the other hand, climate science does not (yet!) have to contend with people who take the predictions and actively use them to further confound the system.<p>(I say ""yet"" because if climate science becomes good enough to use it for engineering, all long-term predictions go out the window once nations start actively engineering outcomes. Note this isn't a criticism of climate science, it would in fact be strong validation, if the interventions worked as predicted. It's just that predictions predicated on the lack of intervention would no longer be valid.)",1265503058

1106977,comment,1106222,1106548,0,0,jrockway,,,"<i>Here's a riddle. The nutrition labeling became law in 1990</i><p>Correlation does not imply causation.  The cause of the ""obesity epidemic"" is overeating of nutrient-poor processed foods.  These foods exist because the food industry needs to show its shareholders that 12%-per-year growth, but the population is not growing that quickly, and it's hard to get people to eat 12% more carrots per year.  The solution is to sell less nutrients for the same amount of money, the side effect is that people eat more calories than they should, and balloon into the current problem.  Food labeling is completely irrelevant, because the people that become obese eat what tastes good, not what a label tells them is healthy.<p>I find food labels to be very useful.  Sometimes things have surprisingly high fat content, and the label points this out to people who care.  (Ever cook your shrimp in coconut milk and notice how delicious it is?  It's because the coconut milk has 20 grams of fat in 2 tablespoons.  Bet you wouldn't have realized that without the label.)<p>You're right that it's obvious that a pint of ice cream or a bag of chips is unhealthy.  The labels are for the cases when it's not as clear.  There is a lot of junk-ish food that is actually pretty healthy, and there is a lot of healthy-seeming food that is actually very unhealthy.  The labeling allows you to identify these special cases.<p><i>On a side note, I am from India and we don't have this nutrition label requirement and India doesn't have obesity problems. It's about what and how much people eat, nutrition label ain't gonna change it.</i><p>I think this is because a large majority of India's population can't afford to overeat processed food.  Give everyone more money, and you'll see the same problems as in the US.",1265502295
