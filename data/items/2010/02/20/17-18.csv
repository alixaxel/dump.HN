1139153,comment,1138481,1138559,0,0,camccann,,,"<i>Functors are containers that can apply a function (""fmap"") to their contents. (...) Monoids are even more generic -- they are something that has an ""identity"" and an ""append"" operation.</i><p>Argh! Pet peeve time. Functors are not containers and calling them that makes it harder to understand how something like IO, ((->) a), or a Parsec parser qualify; also, some container types aren't (and can't be) Functors because they aren't polymorphic in the contained type (IntSet or ByteString, for instance).<p>Likewise, calling the Monoid operation ""append"" is needlessly confusing (and yes, the names the standard library uses are terrible). It's an associative binary operation with an identity value and no semantics whatsoever beyond that. Appending data structures is likely to form a monoid, but so can merging them (union and intersection both work). Any instance of Ord forms monoids under min and max. Functions are a monoid under composition. Even () forms a (trivial) monoid.<p>I'm pretty sure none of that is news to you, but I think using descriptions like ""container"" and ""append"" invoke too many preconceived ideas for people new to Haskell and creates barriers to understanding more than it helps. Most of this stuff is actually quite simple, but it's almost painfully abstract, and using concrete metaphors of familiar things obscures the full generality.<p>It's particularly a problem with Monoid, because the concept is both utterly trivial and broadly useful, but calling it ""append"" leads to people complaining about Haskell using a needlessly cryptic term for ""appendable things"" while simultaneously missing the entire point of the type class.<p><i>So anyway, just start programming, and you'll see why these abstractions are useful. You'll also see why ""easy to understand"" abstractions like ""foldable"" and ""traversable"" are useful too, even though there is not much category theory there.</i><p>For what it's worth, from a mathy perspective, I think Traversable represents some sort of distributive law between Functors (e.g., lets you do something that looks like ""f (g a) -> g (f a)"").<p>In categorical terms Foldable is related to ""catamorphisms"", though to my understanding the relevant bits of category theory were first explored by, and remain of interest mostly to, programming language theorists.
