1091944,comment,1091282,1091688,0,0,GHFigs,,,"<i>I'm curious why people think e-books should be so cheap?</i><p>Many years of rhetoric about other industries' transitions from atoms to bits have left many with the mistaken impression that the price should gravitate toward the cost of moving and storing the bits rather than the value in their particular arrangement.<p>The peak of this way of thinking was AllOfMP3, that dubiously legal Russian site that used to sell music by the megabyte. There were people who actually considered that <i>fair and reasonable</i>. Fortunately we're all a little more used to the idea of paying for bits these days, but the tendency to under-estimate their worth is persistent.",1265007442

Besides inertia, there are some established players who have a lot riding on that not changing, also.<p>Details in this kvetch from Sun engineer Bryan Cantrill (Sun's ZFS-based storage servers do pretty much exactly what you propose, but lose out to NetApp in the SPEC benchmarks): <a href=""http://blogs.sun.com/bmc/entry/eulogy_for_a_benchmark"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.sun.com/bmc/entry/eulogy_for_a_benchmark</a>",1265007358

1091940,comment,1091698,1091915,0,0,chrischen,,,"Wow I just checked up on HN and surprised to see a bunch of responses to this post.<p>Sorry if I offended anyone, but I want to offer an explanation as to why it's the only blog post. I don't have a blog. That's why it's the only blog post, and I've heard that it'd be better to submit a blog post instead of typing it all in the comment when submitting. So I decided to start a blog.<p>I really wanted to get that post out and google blogs kept on rejecting my display name so I kept adding to it until it worked. I also really wanted to go to sleep last night. But I am actually going to keep that URL, at least until I buy my own personal domain.<p>So yea I didn't intend to ""spam"" and I think I had something meaningful to say, so before you go ahead and label it as spam, please at least read it.<p>Also to address your statement about merit: I think that only applies in a perfectly ideal system. No offense to HN, but I don't think the system is perfectly ideal yet. I think there are probably tons of stuff that are deserving of attention but simply posted at the wrong time. I know this because I've seen lots of people post ""duplicate"" and what else could have caused it than the fact that the system somehow failed. And because I don't have perfect faith in the system I feel I had to ""plug"" it. But I did my best not to cheat. I think my link was at least somewhat appropriate (also I tried to be upfront about the promotion too by admitting I was desperate--that wasn't edited in).<p>So if you truly believe in a meritocracy, then please, I'll ask again, take a look at the article and determine its merit by the article alone without the need to judge it by my supposed shamelessness.<p>Also take a look at my previous comments. This would be the first time I not only self-promoted but also ""spammed"" a link.",1265007022

1091933,comment,1091895,1091895,0,0,_delirium,,,"I can't really agree with the apparent conclusion that the agency model is a good thing. It's more or less a revival of retail price mandates, where the manufacturer dictates to retailers exactly what they must sell a product for, instead of selling it wholesale and letting the retailer set its own prices.<p>That sort of manufacturer-set price model is popular in Europe but generally not permitted in the US, because it's rather anticompetitive: it effectively prohibits retailers from competing with each other on price, because they have no control over prices. Europe likes that, because it keeps companies like Amazon and Wal-Mart from undercutting the local bookstore, if it's illegal to sell books under list price; but I'm not sure it's good for consumers or, more generally, efficient markets.",1265006650

For the last ~30 years both parties have done it. The only point of contention is which party does it more. As long as it remains a political issue I don't see a good solution. For Pay As You Go I like the idea that you simply cannot spend this money. You can go back to your home district and tell the people you didn't vote for X, Y, Z because it was illegal to overspend. The system we have now makes spending too much of a political tool. We can't trust them to use it wisely.",1265006606

It's turtles all the way down.<p><i>And it's not like there are no distribution channels for your flash app, after all the internet is free and open</i><p>You'll sell more lemonade from a store shelf than a stand on your front lawn. The reason people are willing to give up 30% to a platform vendor or 50% to a game site is that actually getting your product in front of people and giving them a way to give you money is a pretty valuable service. You cannot just put something on some webpage and expect to make a cent. Believe me, many have tried.<p><i>I don't really give a damn what's good for Apple.</i><p>I never said you did. I'm just talking about the motives of another party, just like my first post. You seem to care quite a bit about their actions--I'm not clear on whether it's as a developer or as a user or both--so I just assumed that talking about motives would be relevant.<p>It's not really just about Apple, either. Flash is not going to be unseated by iPhone/iPad applications alone, but by the combination of HTML5 and growth of native applications on <i>every</i> platform that doesn't support Flash.<p><i>And yet there are still flash apps that I want to use that aren't available on the iPhone.</i><p>Yeah, and? Your point of control here is in choosing not to buy a device which doesn't suit your needs. That should be obvious.<p>But again: you probably don't care about those applications and not the fact that they're built on Flash. From Apple's perspective there are really only two possibilities: either development of Flash alternatives in the form of HTML5 and native applications eventually reach the point that your demands are met by their products, or they that never happens and that forever remains barrier to your interest in what they want to sell. I think there are very good reasons to believe the former is more probable than the latter. You may have dozens of other reasons to not want their product, but so long as you (and most people) don't demand Flash for the sake of Flash, it's nonsensical to include it.<p><i>I'm only concerned about whether or not Apple is serving my needs...</i><p>That's your business. I'm simply responding to your comments on my comments.<p><i>...whether or not blocking flash is a way to increase their profits or my enjoyment</i><p>The two are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they usually go hand in hand. If you buy a product and like it, you have both increased the maker's profits and your enjoyment. Everybody wins.<p><i>I believe at least part of Apple's intentions in blocking flash is to lock you in their own proprietary platform</i><p>How? Apple can't force anybody to develop for their platform.<p>I don't see how someone who develops iPhone applications is anymore ""locked in"" to the platform than someone who develops for the Mac, or Windows, or Flash, or Android, or Xbox, or whatever. I thought the whole complaint about the App Store was that everyone else was ""locked out""?",1265005174

Most people don't consult the <i>New York Review of Books</i>. Most people see very few book advertisements. Even those of us who do most of their book buying online still wander through bookstores and libraries. Physical objects have a powerful draw. I buy almost all of my computer equipment online, and yet I still find myself wandering through the Apple Store, just to experience the physical presence of computers and computer users.<p>Dedicated physical bookstores are going to get even harder to keep open. They might get smaller. They might continue to diversify until they're basically cafes with books lining the walls, or small performance spaces where authors gather to hold readings, or something. But I suspect that, somehow, the biggest and most successful publishers will continue producing copies of physical books and putting them on shelf displays in places where readers are likely to gather, just to get those books in front of people's eyes at the exact moment when those people are in a book-browsing mood.<p>Then they'll sell electronic copies. Right there in the store. Barnes and Noble apparently agrees with me: They're plugging the Nook front and center in their brick-and-mortar stores.<p>Or, maybe I'm wrong. It will be interesting to see how it plays out.<p>PS: To anticipate every reader's first objection to my wacky hypothesis: This didn't save the music stores because music is inherently unbrowseable in a store. Music stores used to have little listening stations with headphones, but did anyone ever actually use those things? They never had what I wanted to hear. The iTunes store blows that experience away, to say nothing of Pandora or YouTube or a filesharing network.",1265004162
