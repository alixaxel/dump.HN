1119486,comment,1083860,1083860,0,0,Adammvega,,,"Being a college student I think a great note taking app is very necessary for the ipad.  It would need to be able to switch from sketching ability (drawing pictures,and writing quick notes with your finger with different colors) to keyboard input with a seamless touch of an onscreen icon.  The thing that would make a superior application for taking notes would be multiple-angle keyboard text input.  Basically, with a swipe of the finger you should be able to dictate the angle at which text is entered on the screen (e.g. Swiping my finger at a 45 or 60 or 70 or 90 degree angle, or any angle, would thus make the text be input at that angle on the screen).  This would be idle for entering text around a picture you have drawn on screen, or entering a note in the margin just like you would if you were taking notes with pen and paper.  I think that ability would make the ipad the ultimate school electronic device hands down!  Obviously, there should be an elegant start up screen holding multiple notebooks.  For that I actually like the startup screen for the iWork apps that have been shown.  Finally all this would be for not if there is not a very simple way to put your notes onto a home computer.  Well this is my little idea, I think it could be an extremely useful app for the ipad for students as well as the corporate world.  Not to mention, that if done write, meaning keeping it simple and not trying to make it more than it should be (because, think about it, a pen and paper doesn't do much, but they do what they do absolutely flawlessly) could be very profitable for the creators of such an app.",1265939817

Many of the worst-behavers I've encountered act similarly or worse on the internet, and the reverse has been quite accurate for the few I've encountered in that manner.  It's certainly prejudice, but that doesn't make it wholly (or even mostly) invalid.<p>Prejudices have a prejudiced opinion applied to them.  That snarling dog?  It may not bite you, but it's rational to be prejudiced towards believing it may harm you.  Though it may often be wrong, it proves valuable in the long run.  The same goes for the person with a knife out, glaring at you, looking drunk.  It could be totally harmless, but it may not be.  By all means, go into the dark alley with them if you are wholly against prejudice.<p>Unless, of course, they're never examined.  They can be wrong or detrimental just like anything else.

The funny thing is that an English professor is more qualified to say whether your paper is a good paper than a grading computer is to say whether your program is a good program.  Automated tests are not a production environment for a program.  A living, breathing reader is a production environment for a paper.<p>Might I be too bold in suggesting that CS students prefer the determinism of a grading script because they are worried how their code will hold up in the real world?  Given the quality of code most CS students produce, that's actually not that bold of an assumption.  Seems to me that CS students that do not favor how grading is done in English have that opinion because they aren't used to thorough assessment in CS [1].<p>[1] The notable exception being theory classes.  Go theory!  But in those classes you've got a living, breathing grader as well. :-p<p>EDIT:  I realize I didn't really address your point.  Yes, that is a fair characterization of the quote in the Times.  The problem lies in assuming the grading script is doing as good of a job as your English professor in determining correctness.  I bet if you increased the accuracy of the grading method for programs you would sacrifice on precision and students wouldn't be as confident about their programs.  If you graded on coding style and design decisions, for example.  So yes, CS students can be more confident.  But confident of what?  The fact that your program conforms to a script?  That's not the same as being confidant that your program actually works.",1265938256
