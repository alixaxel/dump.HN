Here's a trivial scenario for you: a user inputs a URL which represents a web service and a method name.  Your code needs to determine if the object which will get returned as JSON by that web service implements the method or not.<p>There are more complicated examples which occur in actual production systems.  For example, suppose you're interfacing with Big Freaking Enterprise code that you can't change, and there is a rule that certain objects have to have certain checks done prior to being sent over the wire.  Those checks might be implemented as methods decorated with @FireThisCheckBeforeSendingThisOverTheWire annotations, but that isn't the only way to skin this particular cat.  In particular, your million lines of legacy code might have a coding convention where any method starting with ""check"" gets fired.  This worked fine when the code was only running in its own little world and teams of overpaid engineers maintained lists of all the check methods for various classes, but now that code needs to get exposed via a new API to meet some emergent business need, and you want to accomplish this without touching the million line codebase that nobody really understands.  Enter the reflection API.<p>Incidentally, expecting a coding convention like that to actually work isn't totally insane.  JUnit 3, I think, treated any method starting with test as a test.  I personally prefer it for usability over ""slap an annotation on it"".<p>Anyhow, Enterprise Java: abandon all hope ye who enter here.",1265252189

1099631,comment,1099178,1099249,0,0,ynniv,,,"JavaScript was based on Scheme with a ""C-like"" syntax to make it more widely appealing, so spiritually JavaScript <i>is</i> LispScript.  More to your point, other browser scripting languages have been done and already failed.  IE supports VBScript, Firefox could at one point support Python via an extension.  The reality is that browser implementors want to support all sorts of things, but the only ones that matter are those that are supported in all browsers.  Since you cannot create a new browser without supporting JavaScript, and JavaScript solves the code problem, it is the only language that will ever be used in browsers.<p>Which leads into the second question: whats wrong with compiling to JavaScript?  Compilation is historically (outside of a VM) the only way to write portable code.  Most compiled languages have a toolchain that covers compiling, profiling, and debugging, and there is no reason to assume that a language compiled to JavaScript could not have these as well (ex an external profiler might look like dynaTrace Ajax).<p>You might not like JavaScript, but its all we're going to get.  Most people don't like programming x86 assembly, but I don't see them complaining that CPUs need to support a different assembly language.",1265252039

1099629,comment,1099451,1099451,0,0,acangiano,,,"Good tips. Here are a few further comments.<p>> 1. Start with an Outline<p>It's not a bad idea to have a rough draft of your script ready that outlines what you're going to say for each slide or during the coding sessions.<p>> 2. Focus on the Audience’s Needs<p>Be as practical as possible. Theory may be necessary of course, but a screencast is an excellent medium to SHOW rather than simply tell someone how to do things. That's the whole point behind screencasts.<p>> 3. Get a Good Mic<p>The cheapest microphone that could possibly get the job done is the Logitech Desktop USB Microphone (under $30). If your budget permits it, the next step up would be the Samson C01U with a stand, shockmount and pop filter. We've found it delivers the best bang for your buck.<p>> 4. Lock Out the Noise Makers<p>You'll hate ambulances, trust me. Two quick tips regarding that: 1) Pick the quietest room in the house; 2) If you hear a temporary sound, keep recording while repeating what was interrupted by the loud sound. Cutting the undesired part of the audio/video is far easier than stopping and restarting the whole recording session.<p>> 5. Consider Separating Audio and Video<p>Doing both simultaneously saves time, but it's really hard and the best results are usually obtained when audio and video are not recorded together. In my experience, most authors have found that recording the two things separately takes longer, but it's far easier. In the beginning, you can expect an hour of work for every one minute of production quality screencast. With experience and a well tested workflow, this number can be drastically improved upon.<p>> 6. Clean Up Your Desktop<p>Use a white background or a solid color, and be consistent about it. Some programs, like ScreenFlow for Mac, have a ""hide desktop"" option that automatically hides all the icons on your desktop.<p>> 8. Plan a Dress Rehearsal<p>If you record fragments of video without too much care for the audio the first time around, you'll get the timing right and it will act as a rehearsal. Once this is done, you can discard the audio track, and go for the polished recording of the audio as the video rolls.<p><shameless-plug>My startup, <a href=""http://ThinkCode.TV"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ThinkCode.TV</a> is doing pretty well in the Italian market, and we plan to go live with an English catalog by the end of March.

1099625,comment,1098559,1099320,0,0,grellas,,,"Corporate personhood goes back to the beginnings of the English common law and was not the product of a mere ""legal accident"" by the U.S. Supreme Court.<p>Blackstone's Commentaries (11th edition, 1791), volume 1, p. 467 (ch. 18, ""Of Corporations""):<p>""We have hitherto considered persons in their natural capacities, and have treated of their rights and duties. But, as all personal rights die with the person; and, as the necessary forms of investing a series of individuals, one after another, with the same identical rights, would be very inconvenient, if not impracticable; it has been found necessary, when it is for the advantage of the public to have any particular rights kept on foot and continued, to constitute <i>artificial persons</i>, who may maintain a perpetual succession, and enjoy a kind of legal immortality.<p>These <i>artificial persons</i> are called bodies politic, bodies corporate, . . . or corporations: of which there is a great variety subsisting, for the advancement of religion, of learning, and of commerce; in order to preserve entire and for ever those rights and immunities, which, if they were granted only to those individuals of which the body corporate is composed, would upon their death be utterly lost and extinct."" (my emphasis)<p>I cite Blackstone, no small figure in either legal history or the law undergirding the U.S. constitution, to emphasize that he regarded it as <i>central</i> to the idea of what constitutes a corporation that it was to be treated as a legal ""person."" This is found in my <i>1791 edition</i> of this work.<p>Thus, this doctrine is hardly new or radical and certainly no one felt the need to mock it over the 200+ years during which it has been in effect by suggesting that a corporation exercise rights of a citizen by running for office.<p>All that said, I understand your point about its being claimed that this doctrine was accidentally incorporated into the Court's constitutional analysis but the core doctrine runs much, much deeper than the particular case cited in your linked article and (as reflected in the Blackstone quote) is and always has been fundamental to understanding the legal idea of a corporation.",1265251930

""How to vote"" cards are handed out at all polling booths by the parties contesting the election. These how to vote cards indicate how to allocate your preferences to the maximum benefit of the party of your allegiance. About 80% of voters mark their votes per the cards.<p>This means that a party on the left will allocate it's first few preferences to other parties on the left and a party on the right will allocate it's first few preferences to other parties on the right, unless these parties are extremely radical in which case they usually fall to the bottom few preferences.<p>Senate representation is proportional so that in a simplified election of 5 seats 20% of the vote wins a seat. Proportional representation combined with preferential voting leads to outcomes where fringe senators are elected with less than 2% of the primary vote.<p>Australia is an effective two party state where elections are generally won by low margins. Control of each house, particularly the senate, often depends on pandering to the whims of fringe parties who hold the balance of power. This, combined with attempts to frame policy so as to draw fringe voters back to the two major parties, results in government policy which seems out of place in a modern democratic socialist nation.<p>This is one such policy.<p>Edit: It's worth mentioning that at present both sides of federal politics are chasing the so called ""values voters"" and are involved in a pissing match to prove who is the most Christian conservative.",1265249814

1099561,comment,1099175,1099499,0,0,Mallard,,,"To answer with an example, a lot of these experiments entangle the ""spin"" property of two particles. In a two-state system such as spin up and spin down, it is tempting to call, say, ""up"" 1 and ""down"" 0, but you won't get too much use out of that. What you'll often read is that when you take two entangled particles and take them to opposite ends of the room (or the universe), and you measure your particle as having spin up, you know at once that the other particle must have spin down. That is a function of conservation of angular momentum, and has a very intuitive classical analog.<p>Before you make a measurement, though, the particle you measured is in a combination of both states. It's not that you don't know which it is; it really is neither (to the best of modern interpretations). If it has equal probability spin up or down, you are equally likely to measure either one. Once you measure it once, though, and get either up or down, if you immediately measure again, you'll get the same result. That's the hastily abused ""collapsing the wave function."" If you consider the  wave function of the particle with regard to its spin states to be representative of a probability distribution of measuring either state, once you measure it, the state you measured has probability one and the rest have probability 0. The new wave function is just a delta, and has been collapsed.<p>Now to get on with answering your question-- you've not only collapsed this particle's wave function; you've collapsed the other one's too.Instantly. So, you know what the other guy taking measurements on his will measure. What you have no control over is the information content itself. You can't spin your particle so the other one spins in the opposite way. It just doesn't work that way. Information propagation in relativity comes with a caveat-- causal information travels no faster than the speed of light. Non causal information can travel as fast as it likes. It's not spooky action at a distance because it's not really action. Nothing's different in the tangible world as a result of it, which is why you can't use it to send bits. If you're really interested, I recommend Griffiths' Intro to Quantum Mechanics. It was used in all of my related courses, and the author has a way with the inexplicable.",1265249330
