There are moral arguments for and against enhancement, but the way it currently is prohibited, yet tolerated (nearly everyone who really wants to can game the prescription requirement), is the worst way to handle it.<p>So why not allow healthy people to take it? Because it distorts the competition - not who studied the most wins, but he who enhanced himself best. If you allow some enhancement, why not others forms? What about artificial limbs for athletes? Where does enhancement stop? What about everyone then feeling pressured to enhance themselves to still be able to compete, if they want to or not?",1266746261

I think a better metric of how evovled or human-like something's consciousness is would be capacity for analogical reasoning.<p>Humans are by far the best, by the great apes and dolphins can do it too.<p>A biologial metric that is more accurate than brain size is cortical folding.

Windows Mobile phones have the concept of cursor and I can have a mouseover by holding the cursor over something whether it's with a finger or stylus, and then click by tapping either with my finger or stylus.<p>What's the disadvantage to having an invisible cursor so that mouseovers work? Couldn't the cursor ""appear"" to the system when your finger is on the screen, similar to how the cursor shows for restaurant POS terminals when your finger is on the screen and then disappears when your finger is off it.

1140381,comment,1140164,1140254,0,0,DaniFong,,,"How do you suppose their motives? Do you claim to have some sort of window into the minds of those working at Whole Foods?<p>Maybe the people of Whole Foods, the entrepreneurs, the investors, the daily stakeholders, are in fact working towards the benefit of society as a whole because that's what motivates them. Many people find their happiness in the growth and happiness of other human beings. It is implied that this other-centeredness is normal only if it is confined to romantic partners, or nuclear family, but who among us isn't moved by the struggles of a population ravaged by natural disaster, war, plague or famine? It may well be that one's motivations, human creatures as we are, might be shoehorned into the rubric of self-interest (misleadingly named though it would be) by saying that other-centeredness makes <i>us</i> feel better. But one might as easily say that one's more self-centered actions are in fact shaped by the entire society as in the invisible hand, designed in fact to help others: your food choices are not, in fact, your own, but shaped by corporate stakeholders for their own interests. You can look at it either way.<p>The point is that motivations are varied and complex, and cannot be summarized neatly in phrases such as 'utility' or 'self-interest' without hiding demons worth of complexity within them.<p>I personally work for others, for the people of the world, the whole of its green mantle, the earth's future potential. In this way I extend my extended phenotype, it is true -- in some way I will exist and persist as forces and memes and influences varied and grander and grander, with time, if cloudier, muddied, dilute. But I will also be working for something that has always been and will always be greater than my own small self. There is joy in this, but it is not centered in me.",1266743775

I don't think that the answer is simply to simulate one with the other.<p><i>There have been dozens of studies with very young children who have had 0 experience with traditional computers who simply ""get"" touch devices, because its human nature.</i><p>Case in point: my 2 year old.  He can use my iPhone with no problems.  He can swipe the main screen left and right to find the icon he's looking for.  Start the program, and be on his way.  He can also start up iTunes on it, and play his music videos that I've loaded onto it.  He also completely ""gets"" how to use the picture viewer.  Now, if iTunes is playing my music and doesn't come up with the video screen, he's lost, but for the most part, it works well.  The touch interface makes so much sense that he figured out how to get around in 2 minutes.",1266743480

Motion on a trackpad is saved by the computer as a change to the cursor position.  This can be simulated by saving state in the touchDown/touchUp events, but it isn't like polling for the current mouse position.<p>The other thing to think about is that if you do have a mouseover event, you are likely going to try and display something (like a tooltip).
