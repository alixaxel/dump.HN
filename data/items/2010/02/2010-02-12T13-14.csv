There's just something about putting your thoughts into words that helps you crystalize certain ideas that float around in your head.<p>For instance, if you read most of Paul Graham's essays, you'll notice that they probably serve more to teach him than to actually share things.<p>Plus, having people <i>read</i> your thoughts serves as a good way to gauge whether you're on the right track or not.

Since you're hosting your own proxy for the script anyway you'd be better off having the proxy convert the XML in to JSON and serving it up using JSON-P so it works reliably cross-domain.<p>Your plugin hard-codes the HTML that's used to display the buzzes. While that's convenient, it's also inflexible. I would suggest splitting the logic up in to two parts - one that gets the recent buzzes and turns them in to JavaScript data structures, and one that takes those data structures and formats them as HTML. That way people who want to do their own processing / formatting of the Buzz data can still use the first half of your plugin.",1265982360

1120467,comment,1120077,1120077,0,0,loso,,,"This is not the only time that the music business has played this game, more specifically the RIAA. From 1997-2004 I worked a lot in the world of Hip Hop on a regional scale. I did security for clubs and artist and I was a DJ. Before file sharing exploded, the mixtape was the way that people would get exposed to underground hip hop artist, the most popular being 50 Cent but also many others.<p>So what the industry would do is to send free music to DJ's from both the worlds of mixtapes and radio. They would beg and plead for you to feature their artist on the mixtape. This is coming from both the A&R's that worked directly for the labels and third parties whose whole job was to find popular mixtape DJ's and give them music. They were hired by record companies as well. So anyway, after you released a mixtape, you would give it to a store at a consignment price. In other words, you would give them a box of CD's and they would sell them a set price depending on how popular you were. Then you come back and split the money, of course bigger DJ's would work out a different deal.<p>So everyone in the industry is aware of this fact and they play along with the so called ""street"" rules. But the RIAA would come down and bust these stores for selling bootlegs. These are items that would be cosigned by record labels with artist even hosting the tapes but they would still bust the shops anyway. Legally, there was no paperwork so in the eyes of the law they were bootlegged and if it was the police that came down hard, I would have less of a problem. But it would be the RIAA, basically the record companies would backdoor the DJ's and the mom and pop stores.<p>This is why I am glad that the music business has taken such a big hit.

1120438,comment,1118991,1120331,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"While you're right that ""global by default"" is usually a problem, it isn't in Lua, because Lua also lets you restrict the global scope (with i.e. setfenv). Generally, the ""global"" scope you get by default is ""global <i>to the current module</i>"", i.e., publicly exported from a module.<p>It's still not a problem if your whole program is in one file, though. Since the global environment is <i>just another table</i>, you can set its metamethods to warn about any accidentally global vars. This is an example in PiL, and strict.lua is included in the standard Lua distribution. require ""strict"", problem solved.<p>The Lua designers know that unrestricted global-by-default vars cause a lot of pain in Awk, but defaulting to local scope for everything instead can make using closures awkward (as in Python), since it's difficult to know automatically where variables are local <i>to</i>. In the other languages you mention, C doesn't have proper lexical scoping, Scheme and Common Lisp have fully parenthesized syntax (and thus no scoping ambiguity), Python's closures are awkward, and Haskell (and ML) use let blocks and other explicit scope markers. This is a semantic issue in any language where you can nest blocks and the default is a series of statements, not individual statements (i.e., ""begin"" / ""progn"" is the default).<p>See also: <a href=""http://lua-users.org/wiki/LocalByDefault"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lua-users.org/wiki/LocalByDefault</a>",1265980367
