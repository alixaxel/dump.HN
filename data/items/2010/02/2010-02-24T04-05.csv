1147300,comment,1146684,1146684,0,0,kirse,,,"I don't know about others, but driving above the speed limit (i.e. 75 in a 55) forces me to pay extremely close attention to everything that is going on while driving.  That way, I'm actively engaged in passing people, constantly scanning ahead to maintain safe following distances, and constantly updating my awareness of the ""bubble"" that surrounds my car and where I can go should a situation unfold on the highway.<p>Then again, I have to put up with New Jersey drivers here in Philly, so that usually involves an entire repertoire of techniques to put them safely behind you.  For example, as I'm approaching a Jersey driver in the left lane doing 55, I'll pull the car nearer to the median so they catch my Xenon headlamps in their driver's side mirror.  This is preferable to flashing high-beams because it's not perceived as road-ragey and casually alerts the yellow-plates that you want to get by.<p>The MSF courses teach this driving style to motorcyclists, that in all situations you want to know exactly where you would go to escape an accident, and in general you want to accelerate out of any situation where you are put at risk.<p>It's aggressive defensive driving at its best.",1266987197

1147293,comment,1146684,1147075,0,0,brc,,,"My experiences are the same as yours, but you've clearly spent more time there than me.<p>I would say the two greatest differences between German Authobahns and US interstate traffic comes down to two factors:
- road condition and maintenance.  The Autobahn roads are near perfect in design, drainage, signage and smoothness
- driver attitude : as you noted, 'undertaking' or passing on the right is not only illegal, it is considered to be rude.  Someone driving faster than you is in a hurry, not throwing down a challenge to you.  You let them on their way, not try and impede their progress. A single flash of the lights to a slower vehicle to move right is not considered rude.
- I would disagree on the average 80-90 mph on the unrestricted sections.  I would estimate that most occupants of the 'fast' lane in ordinary vehicles would be doing 100-120 mph.<p>Another bonus of the Autobahn system is that 'normal' cars are more popular than SUV's because you just can't drive SUV's that fast, unless you have a high-end Mercedes, Porsche or BMW.  Having an artificially lower speed limit encourages oversized vehicles because the speeds are low enough that their mass and frontal area don't affect progress and fuel consumption as much.<p>While I would say the study probably has some merit, it's very important with these time based studies to allow for the increased driver survival rate in more modern cars.  I did not see that with this study, but it can be a crucial factor.",1266987007

More lying?<p>It seems to me that the proponents of the law should have the burden of conclusive proof, not the opponents.<p>Speed limits are a major imposition on drivers.  They would have to have a significant effect on fatalities to be worthwhile.  What about spending the same effort on other life saving approaches, such as mandating safer vehicles?  Is that more efficient?",1266986848

But when you do the math with 3 founders and a $50m exit, that's basically each of you walking away with somewhere between 10-15m and YC walking away with 3-3.5m.  So the YC experience is shedding your personal take by $1m or so before taxes...  But very well could make the difference in you succeeding or failing.<p>It could also make the difference in the price tag.  The YC brand and the early boost you get from it almost certainly would up the price tag by $3m in that scenario.<p>(NB: it's a bit more complex than that if/when you take a Series A round, offer employee stock options, etc-- but bottom line is that the YC stock isn't going to make big difference.

We base our browser support requirements on their requirements.  So until fewer people use IE6.  As of last month, IE6 still has 10% of the market share (source: <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp</a>).<p>So many companies won't ditch IE6 until fewer people use it.  Of course, the surest way to get IE6 users to upgrade is for support to die.  Thus the IE6 snake of suckitude begins to eat its own tail.<p>It could well be that it won't be until their hardware dies and they're forced to get a new computer that a lot of people will upgrade their browser.",1266984641

Why did you take the job originally? was it because the company was a global multi-billion dollar brand? or was it because you thought you could make a difference.<p>Clearly there is opportunity for improvement. If you are capable of making those improvements, and leading a change, this could be hugely beneficial to you in the future. Either with the current company, or when moving to a new company. 
Taking initiative (from my experience) has regularly paid back in spades, and where it hasn't it has been an amazing learning experience.<p>Taking on each of the issues you mention
1) This is not entirely a surprise. Excel is surprisingly easy to use for scheduling, and you'd be surprised how many people don't know that there are alternatives. Maybe something as simple as setting up a group calendar and teaching people how to use it would help. (I'm currently building a calendaring app which targets this whole excel thing specifically, so I've got some experience with why people use excel).<p>2) your web sites share storage with your e-mail server? is this a SAN? This just sounds REALLY strange, and I agree it makes it seem like your CTO (or whoever) doesn't have a grasp on things. I'd attack this one directly (though politely) and figure out why this is, maybe explain the dangers, and figure out a migration plan to move e-mails to an appropriate location.<p>3)Why is the database so slow? as you say it is a client database, so I can't imagine it is slow due to the number of records. Is the client database important? By the sounds of things, it isn't. Not everything needs to always be updated.<p>4) I believe this issue is very common at many companies. I think it comes down to communication tools, and protocols for releasing code.<p>As I look at what you're up against, I think you may benefit from writing a one pager about how and why you think fixing these issues is important. 
Also, I'd try to get macro, and look at not only how to solve each issue like a task list, but try to find what the common thread is as to why the company has these issues, and what framework/culture/other would not only resolve these issues and others but also prime the company for continued growth.<p>If you can get some people within your company to listen to your plan and get some momentum, you may find yourself helping the company. If you think people in your department aren't interested, you might consider going to HR. It is there job to retain top talent (like yourself), and if you'r e thinking of leaving the company because of these issues, it is possible you aren't the only one. HR may be able to help.",1266984062
