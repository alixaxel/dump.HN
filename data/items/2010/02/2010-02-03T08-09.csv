Salaries in software (and in most white collar jobs) are a negotiation. If all goes well the employer feels they are slightly overpaying and the employee feels slightly undervalued. If either side is happy then there's an inequity.<p>One is <i>not</i> entitled to specific salary, nor is one limited by a specific cap on salary.<p>The second point that there are non-monetary values to a job is well said though.",1265187598
1097377,comment,1094855,1096080,0,0,pmiller2,,,">His point was math has to become relate able again<p>And there's the rub.  Having studied math in grad school, I'd say <i>at least</i> 99% of mathematics research has little or no connection to anything tangible in the real world.<p>One of my good friends is a professor of math, and every once in a while I make sure to rip on him about being ""the world's leading expert in something nobody gives a shit about,"" because it's true.  There are probably fewer than 10 people in the world doing work that's closely related to what my friend is doing.<p>The thing is, (we) mathematicians <i>like</i> it that way.  We're proud of the fact that we choose to work on hard theoretical problems that might not have any kind of real world payoff in our lifetimes because what we're really doing is investigating fundamental logical structures.<p>And, to an extent, part of the reason it's hard to come up with applications of math to daily life is that the mathematics of daily life has become invisible.  Sure, I can talk about how CDs use error-correcting codes so they can survive being scratched up a bit and still play, or I can tell (say) my mom about how Google's pagerank algorithm works to help provide her with good quality hits when she searches the web, but CD's and Google searches are such a part of daily life anymore that these things utterly fail to impress.  The ""average"" person probably thinks mathematics is irrelevant to his or her daily life because they never studied much of it in school and still managed to get by without it.",1265187586

Without criticizing any particular company o industry, this sort of thing is rampant nowadays. It's just as bad, if not worse, in my business (independent film), to the point where I'm now surprised when someone makes me a good offer or accepts my price without significant haggling. As with coding, it's such a cool profession to be in - and intense pressure and challenge can make for such strong team bonds -  that it's almost <i>infra dig</i> to say you also need to make a decent living, or that you might want to spend money on something quite unrelated.<p>For a while I'd argue on the basis that being freelance is more expensive, equipment is expensive (substitute training courses or whatever), taxes and cost of living all force me to set a price X...but I realized that this kind of argument was putting me in an inferior position and giving the power to the buyer.
