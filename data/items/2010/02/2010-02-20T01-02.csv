- If Mozilla decides to stick with it's values and stay free (is anything else even an option?) while the web goes h.264, I'd say a significant part of people will migrate to other browsers. And come on who's going to migrate to IE and Safari isn't that popular on PC, so that's even better for Google and it's Chrome. How could a bigger browser market share be bad? One downside though would be that some smart people who would be really valuable employees and have strong personal values might get pissed off and not join Google.<p>- ""You owe it to the public"" ""if you care about free software"". No matter how much it sucks, the only entities Google owes something is it's creditors and share holders. Sometimes same things benefit both the public and the share holders which is just super, but isn't it a bit naive to ask a publicly listed company not to take advantage of the situation just because it would be nice? Again though there's the possible loss of love, of which effect on the business as a whole I'm not competent to evaluate.<p>- Mobile hardware support is important and it's going to get even more important in years to come. I might be talking out of my ass here, but isn't the world full of hardware support for h.264? If that hardware support is something really generic like doing ICT really fast and can be applied to VP8 then this might not be that important.",1266629480

But, if one of their agents actually went to Ivins' house and pulled out the garbage bag out of Ivins' garbage can in plain sight while Ivins witnessed this theft, that would also explain Ivins coming out of his home, checking his garbage can, and then peering in to the parking lot and woods across from his house to see if the garbage thief was there.<p>The ""analysis"" also makes much of GEB containing references to DNA (the ""Genetic Code""), to the amino acids in DNA, and to codes.<p>I wonder, considering GEB was a huge bestseller, and considering it dealt with these subjects (DNA, etc..) how many biologists have it on their bookshelf?
