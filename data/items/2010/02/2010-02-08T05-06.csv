1109114,comment,1107742,1107898,0,0,sreque,,,"Lexical scoping has almost nothing to do with Perl's ability to close file handles as you describe. As others point out, it's RAII with reference-counted garbage collection. This feature is not-thread safe, which is one reason why perl threads require making an entire copy of the whole program state and treating shared variables specially. The former makes perl threads a mostly useless abomination and the latter causes other problems.<p>For instance, a friend of mine at work who didn't know the full details of perl threads couldn't figure out why his threaded program was running abysmally slow and using tons of memory. When he found out, he ended up just switching to a forking process model. As for the specialness of shared variables, another friend of mine wrestled with the fact that the perl serialization libraries for whatever reason couldn't handle serializing shared variables and he as far as I know never found a way to solve the problem. Bottom line, Perl's morass of bad language design leads to lots of problems that more elegant solutions like ruby's blocks can avoid.<p>Also, reference counting is considered computationally less efficient than global garbage collectors. See the recent paper Myths and realities: the performance impact of garbage collection, which shows that a reference-counting garbage collector performs significantly worse than a mark-and-sweep algorithm.",1265608050

Bing's TV spots fall into two groups:<p>1. A litany of random obnoxiousness followed by some dude saying ""BING"". We don't see someone getting better results from Bing, we just see someone obnoxiously spouting crap and then associate <i>that</i> with the brand. Whoops.<p>2. People trying to answer a question, getting stressed and trying out Bing. Where... well, they don't actually search. They just stare at a background image of a Japanese garden or something, and we're apparently supposed to assume that this makes everything better. Again we don't see how Bing's search results are of benefit to a user, and the message here seems to be that Bing is all style and no substance.<p>Contrast with Google's Super Bowl spot: it consists <i>entirely</i> of showing someone using Google, and presents a coherent narrative of how Google search results are having a positive effect on the user's (off-screen) life. Best of all, the narrative it presents is a cute love story.<p>This is sort of like the contrast between the ""iDon't"" spots and Apple's own iPhone ads; the Droid spots all focused on bashing the iPhone to the exclusion of showing what was good about the Droid, while the iPhone spots just... showed how useful an iPhone is.",1265608020
