It's almost enough to make me <i>willing to eat octopus</i>.<p>A couple degrees either way aren't going to screw up beef, pork, or chicken. If you aim low, it won't screw up fish. If you have a <i>very specific</i> egg doneness target (and eggs are one of the very few things I'm better on a skillet with than in SV), one or two degrees matters a whole lot.<p>And finally, I think one of the big places temperature control matters is with vegetable cookery; there are SV applications that aim to get in between the temperature at which starches break down and the temperatures pectins break down, and if you're trying to do that (I guess to make watermelons that have the mouthfeel of filet), maybe the PID controller is a dealbreaker.",1265065153

2. In order to remove the group, an admin must first remove its members.
3. Removing a group's members is a process that involves manually traversing a list of members and clicking a button beside each person's name.
4. The list of members contains the admin's name.
5. It is possible for the last admin of a group to remove him/herself as the admin of the group (even accidentally).
6. The only way to become an admin of a group is to be invited by an existing admin.
7. Therefore, if the last admin of a group accidentally removes him/herself, it becomes impossible to close the group.<p>I have attempted to contact Facebook about this with no luck.

In other words, he probably set the temperature too high. You don't need to hold chicken at 160f if you're cooking it for 24 hours.<p>* He cooked duck <i>in the prepackaged Duck L'Orange bag</i> he got at Costco.<p>* He declared SV ""not worth it"" for lamb and rib roasts because he doesn't cook them often enough to care, and the conventional oven techniques are ""tried and true"". The conventional techniques for <i>everything</i> are tried and true, and error prone and inconvenient.<p>* Short ribs are a draw? You can ""fool-proof"" braise short ribs for most of a day and wind up with stew meat --- which is great --- or you can ""fool-proof"" SV short ribs and end up with medium rare short ribs, which is something you can't get out of any other cooking technique. And if you want a ""caramelized sauce"" when you're done, you reduce the bag goo. How hard is that?<p>* Anybody buying a SV setup will have no problem doing perfect fish under a broiler?

You might say, what's that? Every item releases volatile compounds that give it smell/taste. When food is heated the molecules vibrate and volatile compounds are released into the air, gone forever. In sous vide, these compounds are retained. This leads to increased flavor. The side effect of this is that you need to be very careful about adding spices and herbs to your food. In sous vide, a little bit goes a long way.<p>Have you ever wondered why foods go together. Like tomatoes and basil. The trick is that they share some of the same volatile compounds. That is how many high-end restaurants know to put seemingly strange combination's of food together and it works. There are volatile compound databases available for many food items.",1265063988

The sales guy promises you the world to convince you to hand over a boatload of cash, even if he knows the car is crap. Why? Because after the paperwork is inked and the money is safely in his bank account, he's done with you and moving on to the next guy. Nevermind if the car breaks on the 31st day - just 1 day past the warranty date. Because all the effort is on that single transaction. He could care less about why you actually need a car.<p>Relationship-based: e.g. System integrators, consulting firms. e.g. They sell you a firewall / router / set up your internal network, but it is in their best interest not to screw you over because your lifetime value to them as a customer is greater than the immediate gain (e.g. marking up the hardware or charging ridiculous installation fees). Plus, they want your respect and need credibility so that next time when you need something else, you will go to them first. E.g. Maybe aside from an email solution for your SMB, you now need, a simple internal collaboration tool installed. Granted there are also sleazy relationship-based sales people, but the difference is that it is not as transactional as a used car salesman.<p>The reason why I mentioned that is because I'm not trying to be the jerk who says ""gimme all your goodies now now now"" and then conveniently forget how I got there when I get there.<p>At the risk of aiming for too lofty of a loooong-term goal - just as Mark Zuckerberg said ""these are my people"" at the last YC SUS, I <3 startup entrepeneurs and I too, wish that I could one day be in a position to be like Paul Graham.

It notes that only 45 percent of the kids who scored 130 or above on the Stanford-Binet would do so on another, similar IQ test at the same point in time. Combine this with the instability of 4-year-old IQs, and it becomes pretty clear that judgments about giftedness should be an ongoing affair, rather than a fateful determination made at one arbitrary moment in time. I wrote to Lohman and asked what percentage of 4-year-olds who scored 130 or above would do so again as 17-year-olds. He answered with a careful regression analysis: about 25 percent.""<p>Most people are surprised that IQ scores can change over time for the same individual. But this is a routine finding of most longitudinal studies of individual IQ. I've gathered other reports of this phenomenon in the psychological literature. For example, young people in the famous Lewis Terman longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius (initial n=1,444 with n=643 in main study group) when tested at high school age (n=503) were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford-Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Parents of those children reported no changes in their children or even that their children were getting brighter (Shurkin 1992, pp. 89-90). Terman observed a similar drop in IQ scores in his study group upon adult IQ testing (Shurkin 1992, pp. 147-150). Samuel R. Pinneau conducted a thorough review of the Berkeley Growth Study (1928-1946; initial n=61, n after eighteen years =40). Alice Moriarty was a Ph.D. researcher at the Menninger Foundation and describes in her book (1966) a number of case studies of longitudinal observations of children's IQ. She observed several subjects whose childhood IQ varied markedly over the course of childhood, and develops hypotheses about why those IQ changes occurred. Anastasi and Urbina (1997, p. 328) point out that childhood IQ scores are poorest at predicting subsequent IQ scores when taken at preschool age.<p>Anastasi, Anne & Urbina, Susana (1997).

1093621,comment,1092382,1093499,0,0,sgk284,,,"I was at Google in 2007, here's my take on it.<p>The people that are working there aren't just the most brilliant in the world, they literally invented a good portion of the internet, computers, computer science, and programming as we know it. They have ""the father of the internet"" (Vint Cerf), the creator of Vim (Moolenaar), the creator of Python (Guido), the lead developer of Firefox (Goodger), several of the lead Linux kernel developers, the creator of memcahced (Fitzpatrick), Ken Thompson and Rob Pike (both notable for several things), and hundreds of other developers that have already proven their worth (Peter Norvig and Jeff Dean come to mind).<p>These aren't just smart people, they're smart people who have changed the world.<p>To put it into context, one day I'm sitting in a meeting and someone says ""Mike is working on an algorithm for that."" Another person asks, ""Burrows?"", to which the first person says ""Yea."" They were talking about Mike Burrows, as in the guy who created the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (among other things). Names of people that have had major impacts like this are routinely brought in casual conversation. It's like working in a programming mecca. The crazy thing is, even the names you wouldn't recognize have most likely had substantial impacts as well.<p>As for critical mass, Google has it. I was standing in a hallway one day reading stats about search traffic on one of the walls (the wall slightly beyond Larry and Sergey's office, for those who have been there), and sure enough Larry, Steve Jobs, and some other guys walk on right by me. When you're big enough to have people like Steve Jobs walking around your halls... some doors open up that simply aren't open to most start ups and companies.<p>The thing is though that the company is really laid back. I was eating lunch one day with my team and there was an open seat. Sergey Brin came over and asked if he could eat with us. Another time it happened during TGIF, and we just sat around and drank beers. At a different TGIF I drank beers with Alex Martelli and we talked about some of the Python books he's written and how he got into hacking on Python. TGIF, in case you didn't know, is a weekly meeting that the entire company has. Every Friday the company gets together, Larry and Sergey get up and talk about what Google has done during the past week and then the floor opens up for Googlers to criticize the company, recommend things they can do better, or show appreciation for things well done. Read that again... Every week the company gets together as a whole and does a self-analysis. Any issues that are brought up will be resolved by the next Friday. When Google does something stupid, it's addressed and fixed in under a week. Most companies have a meeting once a year, and there is no self-analysis going on. After the self-analysis is done, Google has beer, food, and often live music. The company just kicks back, relaxes, and bullshits over beer. They do this every week.<p>As for people that haven't yet made a name for themselves... Google will give you the opportunity to. I was there for two weeks before I was running distributed programs across thousands of machines (prior to being there I had never even done serious multi-threaded programming, yet alone distributed computing). I had a copy of the Internet on one of our teams shares that I would run tests and experiments against. Yea, you read that right, a copy of the Internet (text-only). You are effectively given unlimited resources to do whatever you want. Money is never an issue, only brain power is ever in short supply. You'll never be given hard deadlines, you'll never even really be told what to work on... everything is more of a suggestion. You can find a bug, fix it, and push it live in under 4 hours (I've seen this done) and no one will stop you. If you ever get bored and want to join a different team... your desk and items will be moved to that team within 24 hours (assuming that team can take you on). Engineers are viewed as stem cells... if everyone is brilliant than anyone can learn to fill any role, and they do.<p>The teams bond really well. No one eats lunch alone, you always eat with your team. All the food is free, so you don't have people packing lunches, and all the food is delicious, so you don't have people leaving campus for lunch. Whenever there was a big blockbuster movie(like Transformers when I was there), Google would buy out the local theaters on opening day and take the company to see them. They made sure that you were having fun, and they made sure that you had time to interact with your team in non-professional settings.<p>Also, everyone in the company is at your disposal to help. The organization is nearly flat, but it doesn't matter... you'll never see someone say ""I'm the Director of Blah"", everyone always just uses the title ""Software Engineer"". It's quite a sensation. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of what it's like working there. It is truly quite difficult to explain to someone who's never been there.<p>All that said, it's not perfect and there are lots of sore spots (especially as they keep growing). I won't get into them though simply because this is already long winded enough.",1265062442
