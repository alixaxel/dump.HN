Keynesians at the time were convinced the depression would resume once the war ended.<p>It is interesting to note that the modern Keynesians have turned on FDR. They always are unhappy with his trying to balance the budget after years of New Deal policy failed. They have turned on Hoover because he gave up as well after his version of the New Deal failed. They seem to forget that Keynes himself approved of what Hoover was doing. Their instance on the notion that a stimulus program is never large enough to explain their failures is a pretty old one.",1267325809

Some languages are good for system programming and are good for performance computing (I use C), some are good for what is not performance critical but are more concise and clear (I use Python for that). Go wants to do both, but from what I see in their benchmarks it is the worst of both worlds.

1156306,comment,1155874,1156059,0,0,jerf,,,"OO is the current dominant programming paradigm and has been for the past ~15-20 years. Functional programmers in general can't help but know about OO; most of them were OO programmers before they became functional programmers. Combined with the fact that being popular has advantages (more people working on core code, an increased ability to get a job in $YOUR_FAVORITE_LANGUAGE), which causes a desire to recruit more to their cause, you end up with a strong likelihood of seeing a recruitment pitch targeted at the largest recruitable demographic. In this case, this means promising fire and brimstone to the OO heretics unless you come to the light of FP. (The linked post is not that strong, but I've seen much stronger.) You generally don't see recruitment pitches for logic programmers or VDHL programmers.<p>You should listen to the functional programmer's complaints against OO, then make up your own mind. My programming has gotten a lot more functional lately, but there are certain domains where OO really, really shines and I still end up using it there (GUI widgets, etc). It's definitely not the right solution to every problem, though. (I am aware you did not make that argument, I'm just sayin'.)",1267325170

Personal well being continued to fall dramatically through the war.  GDP went up because the government was buying weapons, i.e. digging and filling holes.  Unemployment went down because people were drafted, essentially enslaving the unemployed.  The depression did not end in any meaningful sense until the war ended and government spending was reduced.  Only in 1946 when you finally had the conditions that both the New Deal morons were gone and the war economy was being shut down did living standards begin to improve.<p>> the point is to evaluate the true cost of something<p>Only the free market can evaluate the true cost of things.  A panel of human beings cannot possibly make a meaningful calculation: there is too much ambiguity and unknowable data.  The things ""worth the cost"" win out and the things not worth the cost go bust in the market.<p>Your points about the government subsidies to the petroleum industry are quite valid, but you seem to miss that the basic failing is government itself.  If oil related businesses had to carry all security and business risk related costs themselves, that would be clearly reflected in prices and substitutes would be more competitive.

However, Plan 9 suggests ways those interpreters could be better structured.<p>The core features of Plan 9 are that programs interact with their environment by naming things, that names refer to whatever programs or their interpreters mount on them, and that interpreters have a protocol to pass the buck to another progam when they don't know what a name means.  To me, those ideas suggest a sequence of titles such as ""Mount: the ultimate module system"" and ""Mount by wire protocol: the ultimate foreign function interface"".  I don't know what papers would have those titles.<p>The idea would be to decouple lisp interpreters and dialects from lisp libraries.  If you could mount any functions that your favorite interpreter lacked, then diversity would cause smaller problems.  You could write a single Apache plugin in C that spoke the apply protocol, and suddenly every lisp would support the mechanics of HTTP.  Or, the web parts of your program could run in Arc on a PC, and mount procedures written in common lisp and running on a supercomputer for the number crunching.

However, when GDP growth is computed, changes in the value of money do not have an effect. E.g. GDP growth from year-1 to year-2 is:<p><pre><code>  (volume produced in year 2)*(prices in year 1)\n  /\n  (volume produced in year 1)*(prices in year 1)\n</code></pre>\nSo reducing the price of something does not in-of-itself have an effect on GDP growth (or GDP stated in nominal terms). However, it's often the case that reducing the price of something means that there is more demand for, so more is produced, so (volume produced in year n+1) goes up, so GDP grows.<p>Summary: if the price of energy is reduced it will most likely lead to GDP growth - whether we could all then live better lives, I don't know.

The unspoken assumption, of course, is that we can let the whole rest of the world languish in poverty so long as we're sure that every appliance in our electrified houses and every damned faucet for our hot and cold running water was made by American hands in an American factory. That's even a consistent worldview--but you have to acknowledge what you have to give up in order to maintain that consistency. If we have to consistently choose not to interfere with cultures less technologically and economically advanced as our own, that means <i>no</i> interference. That's a hard pill for most people to swallow. What's more imperialistic--contracting with a Chinese company for manufacturing or ""rebuilding Haiti"" (in our own image, of course).",1267323721

Reagan was by far one of the worst offenders, unlike what the author leads you to believe with a personal quote from Reagan.  A simple google search for ""reagan deficit spending"" will show just how great this country did during his 8 years.<p>That fallacy clarified, this isn't about democratic or republican, liberal or conservative. The author brushes this off, too, but devotes most of the article to implying the opposite.<p>So the point is to evaluate the true cost of something. Wonderful! Except, I think the author doesn't go far enough.   What of indirect costs and benefits of oil exploration vs. nuclear vs. coal mining, etc?<p>The problem with not focusing on alternative energies is that you continue to feed an anti-imperialistic enemy that then forces you to spend trillions of dollars for the ""sake of national security.""<p>Yes, please, find the true cost of coal mining, oil exploration, etc, and that means factoring not just immediate profit losses and tax subsidies. This means analyzing just how much, for example, it costs to fund wars in order to satisfy our oil demands (ie, how much this country has spent in wars bribing people, funding our veteran's health care, etc for the sake of national security, while we indirectly fund these very terrorist organisations).<p>So it's okay to debt our way to fund such wars, but it's not okay to invest in the education and health of this country's biggest economic contributors--it's citizens?<p>The problem isn't deficit spending/debt. Many successful startups or companies go through such phase where it makes sense to borrow, to dig yourself out of a hole.  The problem is whether you reinvest this back into the country, its infrastructure, its education, its health, its green technologies, etc.<p>FDR didn't get us out of the Great Depression. That's right.  WWII did, deficit spending did.  But then, unlike now the US was producing something other countries needed. Green technology (nuclear, solar, whatever, let them dish it out with some subsidies to offset initial costs) has to be the answer nowadays.",1267323122

True, they aren't (usually) giving away the source for their backend, but javascript, even obfuscated, is 'source', and relatively easy to reverse-engineer.<p>py2exe and py2app do a reasonable job of packaging up your python program into .exe/.app for desktop software. With a toolkit such as QT, though PyQT is non-free, professional looking applications are achievable. PySide, Nokia's LGPL Python QT binding does <i>not</i> have Windows or OS X on their official roadmap, so unless you're willing/able to do the port yourself, I would not count on it.

Cross-platform desktop apps is a special niche, and assuming you lack the resources to do ports for each OS, I'd go with C++ and QT.<p>Python is also not an all-or-nothing choice. There are some professional applications that use Python at some point in the process. Avid Media Composer (professional video editing suite) has a python2X.dll in their C:\Program Files directory, though I don't know what it gets used for.<p>Between the two larger platforms, OS X and Windows (assuming those are the 'cross' platforms you are talking about), QT does a fine job of working on both systems, but the two platforms DO have different idioms that I feel a platform specific port is the only way to do a <i>good</i> job on.",1267322961
