There are websites like ""hot chicks with douchebags"", and there are drop-dead gorgeous women married to complete toads who happen to be wealthy or powerful. Both of your comments are nihilistic dismissals of useful and interesting science on the specious grounds that ""we already knew that"". No we didn't, and even if we did, it's useful to <i>prove</i> it. Just because we had a hunch something was true doesn't mean it's so, and looking into the seemingly obvious can surprise us when it turns out that what we thought we knew was wrong.",1267349666

Certainly the principal second of an orchestra is usually a better player than all but the first few stands of first violins.<p>Though you're right, there is a pecking order by stand number, and another one for outside vs. inside players.<p>Curiously, when I was in MA All-States in 2000, the conductor did an experiment.  He reversed the seating order, temporarily putting the worst players up front and the best ones behind.  And the orchestra as a whole played <i>a lot</i> better.  When they couldn't hide in the back, the weaker players played out and followed the conductor much better, yet the better players continued to do so regardless of where they were placed.  Unfortunately, we couldn't do this for the concert (social conventions being what they were), but the hour or so devoted to the experiment certainly worked out.<p>Make of this what you will.",1267349157

1156671,comment,1156454,1156527,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> unless the lack of parking is compensated for by having an excellent public transit system.<p>That is the key. If public transit system was destroyed or never developed a city would have to either build parking facilities or build a public transit system. It all comes down to these questions:<p><pre><code>   - ""How do we expect people to get downtown?""\n   - ""How do we expect people to get around downtown?""\n</code></pre>\nThe approach a city takes will mostly answer these questions.<p>If nobody lives downtown and they have to commute from distant suburbs, it could make sense in the short term to start building parking spaces. The city is eventually transformed into an ""office city"". Everything closes down at 5. It is hard to even move around the city, so office workers would just go to lunch some place nearby their office, then quickly get in their cars and escape to the suburbs. That is not a city that I would like to live near or go to. But that is what a lot of American cities have become.<p>If many people live downtown or near downtown area, then it makes sense to invest in a public transit system. This also helps people move around the city. It opens an opportunity for evening, and weekend businesses, for entertainment and tourism.<p>This is also a chicken and egg problem. A city could decide to encourage building residential areas downtown to attract different segments of populations there.  But that is a long term solution. It takes many years to revitalize a downtown neighborhood, especially if it is a high crime area, has a lot of abandoned buildings, and most of all, a bad reputation.",1267347887

I live in the latter, about 10 miles from downtown due to cost (about $600-$700 cheaper on rent) and I have to drive in because public transportation would include taking light rail to subway to bus and tack on an extra hour to my commute and cost literally hundreds a month.

1156667,comment,1156361,1156361,0,0,shalmanese,,,"IMO, the best strategy is to develop a very rapid & robust ""cluelessness filter"". I don't get many requests to pick my brain via email but it does happen a lot face to face. At networking events, the first 30 seconds of my interaction with someone is essentially focused on testing for cluelessness.<p>If it's clearly worthless to have a conversation with them, I'll disengage and politely decline further requests to meet up. If there's even a spark of something interesting, I'll generally meet the again for coffee and the half hour of one-on-one time determines whether they're worth regularly touching base with.<p>I don't know how to do it via email, maybe ask them to set an agenda for the meeting before you agree to do it and use their reply to that as a filter.<p>I've gone to enough startup events that I really don't feel guilty anymore outright snubbing the clueless. There's a virtually 100% certainty that they won't amount to much of anything so why waste your mental energy on them.",1267347669
