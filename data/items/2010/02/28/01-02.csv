Obviously you can't make a blanket rule that applies perfectly to everyone, but the alternative is to have no rule and throw everyone to the wolves.

Now. Just stop it. It's very easy to bash child labor but do you know why the child labor exists in first place? Do you think parents of those child have any other alternatives? For their parents, it's a choice between living another day or dieing of hunger. For them, the so called 'abusive' work condition is the only option to survive.<p>To give a little personal perspective, let me tell you my story. I am from India. And when I was 10 years old (in 1990), my mom took up some side work to support us. She would do it 7 days a week and I would do it in evenings and full day on Sunday. We did it not for food but to make sure that me and my sisters could go to school and get the books we need. It was back breaking work but it was worth for me and my family. I was lucky enough that I worked so that I can go to school. Few of my other cousins were not that lucky. They had to work so that they can eat in evening. Because of my education, I have been successful and have been living in USA for last 5 years. Those poor cousins are now grown up and doing an average job but they are doing everything possible to send their kids to school. I am sure their next generation will be much much better off.<p>Before you decry child labor next time, ask yourself, what's the alternative for the child? Are you going to provide that alternative? If not, you are taking away the only viable choice from that child. Please don't do that.<p>For more thoughts, read this: <a href=""http://cafehayek.com/2005/07/postrel_on_edmo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cafehayek.com/2005/07/postrel_on_edmo.html</a>",1267319992

Without minimum working age laws, most poor children will drop out of school and never realize their true long-term potential.<p>It also results in a less efficient economy, as the people recognized to have higher intellectual capacity, and placed in appropriate societal roles, will be a subset of the relatively affluent portion of society, and not necessarily the best-suited.",1267319814

This is why we have laws against sex with children, why children cannot legally gamble or take out loans and why children have special labour laws. An adult is considered to be sufficiently mature to look after themselves, a child is not.</i><p>Children may be more likely than an adult to make a wrong decision. However, it still does not follow that consents law and labor laws actually solve the problem. Young adults still need to accumulate experience and knowledge about potentially abusive deals.<p><i>I suspect that your next argument in favour of the concept is that it would be immoral to take away the job of a child who relies upon that support. I'd argue that, in fact, the moral lapse lies with the parents and society that allows a vulnerable person to be put into that position without having had a chance to mature properly first.</i><p>That is to assume that society and parents have unlimited resources at their disposal. It may be the only moral option.<p>Banning child labor does not in actual meaning child labor will not occur.
