A core skill for B2C products is optimizing them so that the user gets through the workflow successfully.  We optimize for success, because successful users pay us money.  If you have CPC ads on your site, you have to <i>optimize for failure</i>: the ad has to be more enticing than your application/content or <i>you don't get paid</i>.<p>Granted, there are some audiences who don't pay money for anything (why hello, students) and some applications whose users will not pay money for them (why hello, URL shorteners/social networkers/anything starting with the letters Tw), but <i>you don't have to make these</i>.  There is literally infinite need for solutions to problems, even in B2C (C stands for consumer, i.e., one who <i>buys products</i>), that you could deliver profitably.
