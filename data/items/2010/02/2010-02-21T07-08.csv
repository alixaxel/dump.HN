(Actually, the fact that the Ars Technica article used Task Manager made me inclined to dismiss it as clueless.)<p>Estimating real memory pressure is tough. There's the working set; but the working set may expand when you have sufficient physical memory, even though the marginal performance gains may be small. Similarly, the file system cache may expand when you have sufficient physical memory, but the marginal gains become small there too.<p>Probably the best unified metric would be the amount of time applications spend blocked on I/O, where that I/O is either paging committed bytes in from disk, or data that would be cacheable - and would have been cached - on a system with more memory.

1140314,comment,1140036,1140200,0,0,yason,,,"Well, I think the windowing system <i>is</i> to blame. It is vertical space that is precious but your eyes can't find too much use for horizontal space. Think pages of a newspaper that is divided into nice columns and compartments for a good reason.<p>So, there's extra horizontal space on your wall-sized monitor and a good windowing system supports the user in maximizing its usage and not necessarily in maximizing each window. However, systems like Windows make it near impossible to make your windows behave.<p>A typical scenario is having a couple of browser windows open for reading (like having some reference documentation at hand) and simultaneously typing into an active Emacs window partially/mostly underneath them both. If the windowing system insists on popping the active window to the top any of this becomes impossible, and you pretty much have no choice but to fall back to merely flipping between windows, and at this point it begins to feel stupid not to maximize all of them anyway.<p>But the downside is there, too. Going back to books and newspapers for a reference, in opposition web pages can be just horrible to read when the browser window is maximized. You don't read a book in a widescreen aspect ratio either. Your eyes beg for a limited visual region to operate in. As for myself, I've found that I get a nice reading width by stretching the width of the browser window to 2/3 or 3/5 of the width of the screen. If ads are cluttering the sides or the layout flows outside then Readability takes care of it. As for design advice, ""p { width: 66em !important }"" would be good.",1266738038

Activist groups have long looked for a hook by which to bring class actions against those whom they see as perpetrators of wrongs that they wish to stop. In this case, it is commercial tuna fishermen. However, the courts have denied them the right to sue on behalf of the dolphins (which are accidentally killed in the course of industrial tuna fishing) on grounds that dolphins aren't human beings and therefore do not have 'standing' to sue. This means that the activist groups also cannot bring class actions in the name of the dolphins. Of course, if the dolphins are 'self-aware,' then they arguably can be treated in a special way by the courts - as 'non-human humans' - and be given the right to sue. The research is being cast as disinterested science, but I believe it may be motivated by this extra-scientific goal and that is why it is routinely presented along with arguments for better ethical treatment of the dolphins. In essence, the bottom line will be this: better ethical treatment = enforceable legal rights (i.e., enforceable by activist groups suing tuna fisherman in federal court once a court recognizes their right to bring such suits on behalf of a 'self-aware' species that now should have 'standing' to sue).<p>As I have come to see this in such a light, I believe the science here may be authentic but it may equally be agenda-driven, potentially making its findings suspect. I leave that to those who understand the scientific issues (I do not) but it does need to be evaluated in light of this background motive and its implications.",1266736809
