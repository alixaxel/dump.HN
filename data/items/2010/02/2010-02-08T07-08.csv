1109311,comment,1108673,1108673,0,0,jordanb,,,"I recently read the book ""Common Errors in Statistics."" It was really illuminating. They spent a particularly long time discussing errors in various medical studies, although I think that's because the authors' backgrounds are in that area rather than medicine having particularly bad statistics.<p>To attempt to summarize the book, it seems that statistical errors tend to boil down to one of three problems:<p>* Improperly building the experiment, failing to ensure independence or account for confounding variables.<p>* Misunderstanding significance. Reading too much meaning into p-values, and performing post-hoc analysis. Remember that a 95 percent significance level means that in 5 percent of the trials, you'll get a positive result by random chance.<p>* Improperly using tests, by failing to account for their limitations. For instance, using a test that assumes normality when you don't have a strong case that the data is normal. Or using a test that requires a certain sample size on a dataset that is too small.<p>When you think about it, most scientists receive a few semesters of statistics strung out through their education. They learn a little about probability, then how to do a few significance tests and something here and there about regression. They then start doing work where in pretty much every field nowadays, publishing a paper involves statistical analysis at some point. And most of them grope their way through it based on hazy memories of introductory stats classes taken years before.",1265615652
