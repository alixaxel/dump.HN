Plugins can’t modify the behavior of built-in tools, and are therefore absolutely powerless to fix this problem, which affects all of the compositing of layers in Photoshop, and many of its other tools.<p>(As for scaling in particular: many plugins already exist using better methods than bicubic interpolation, and avoiding problems like the lack of gamma correction, etc.)",1266825582

The ancient Athenians had an impressive democratic government from 508BC until it was destroyed, from the outside, in 322BC.<p>You cite ""multi-hundred years of stable government by kings"" like there are no power struggles when a given king dies, and like ""stable"" is even remotely near what we'd call stable or desirable (freedom?). Which history are you reading in which these wonderful benevolent king-systems (not just singular kings if you want ""multi-hundred years"") exist? Cite one.<p>There is no counter-corruption in a system with a powerful executive and no democracy for long. Without checks on corruption and a powerful state there is no freedom for very long. I can't believe the suggestion that the west moves to the model of voting in leaders with ""near-unlimited power to do practically anything they want"" is being taken seriously in a time when questionable wars have been started and torture policies implemented by the already too strong executives.",1266825581

When he was implementing the case-insensitive logins he would, of course, first have to run a query to see if there are any users whose login names collide without case sensitivity. That query would run (according to the slides) really slowly, because it would have to essentially do something like:<p><pre><code>    SELECT a.id, b.id, a.username FROM users AS a, users AS B
    WHERE a.id != b.id AND a.username = b.username AND
    BINARY(a.username) != BINARY(b.username)
</code></pre>
At that point he'd realize the query is taking forever, and use mysql-top or something equivalent to kill the query.<p>Edit: I realize that most likely the username column had a UNIQUE index already, making this query unnecessary.<p>--<p>In his example of find_in_batches where he has to make some changes that applies to all users he makes it sound like the User.all is the big problem because it does a `SELECT * FROM users`. But even when you break up the work in parts you have to be careful, because by the time you're done processing a few of the existing users may have changed already. So as your database becomes too large to do your updates in one big atomic transaction block you almost always have to follow a process like this:<p>1. find set of rows that match the problem (in batches)<p>2. apply the (expensive) fix/migration on those rows<p>3. go back to 1 until the result set is empty<p>4. do (1) and (2) in a big transaction (but since there are only a few rows, that's fine)<p>Of course there are a hundred ways to upgrade a live database safely, but there always must be some kind of process in place otherwise your database is going to go down <i>all the time</i>.",1266825449

1142219,comment,1141490,1141787,0,0,btilly,,,"The logic of evolutionary biology can get tortured, particularly when someone missing something obvious is torturing it.<p>The obvious point that you're missing is that evolutionary status and social status are pretty much unrelated things.  Evolutionary status is how many descendants you have in the far future.  Social status is what society thinks of you.<p>In our evolutionary past the cost of being ""ruined"" was access to fewer resources, which lead to a decreased survival rate for you and your kids, and decreased prospects for future children.  Today the result of out of wedlock pregnancies is more descendants since we all have sufficient resources for basic survival.  The result is an evolutionary pressure towards avoiding the effective use of contraception, and for enjoying sex.<p>This happy state is, of course, unlikely to remain for an evolutionarily significant time.  The simple reason for that is that the continuation of this state will result in exponential growth in human population, leading to resource exhaustion and a Malthusian nightmare.  (Current projections appear to show a halt to exponential growth due to economic and societal pressures.  But that won't last more than a few generations as birth control creates a very strong evolutionary pressure for avoiding the effective use of birth control.  Even modest success at that will reignite exponential growth.)",1266825303

And it is easy to miss if your testing methodology doesn't include ""Now run it against a data set about as big as the production DB.""

In both cases, their servers experience X*N hours of usage, and they only get paid the original Y dollars.<p>The car analogy doesn't hold up, because there is an expectation that the warranty would be used for the entire lifetime of the warranty, whereas games that are sold aren't done so with the expectation that after 40 hours of usage or so, they'd be resold continuously to other parties who would also play them for 40 hours, and so on.  Perhaps a better analogy is that the warranty on a car has an explicit limit on the number of miles that may be driven, which prevents the warranty from being used by multiple parties driving the car continuously.<p>As counterintuitive as it may seem (and, i expect controversial on HN) I actually think providing a service code with the original game (that can be purchased for $10 by future purchasers of the game) actually aligns the use of the service and payment to the server operators quite well, without getting into the ugly world of ""You may use the online service for Z hours before your account times out.""
