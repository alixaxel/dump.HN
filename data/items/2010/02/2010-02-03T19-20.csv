1098676,comment,1098474,1098474,0,0,MrSartorial,,,"I think the author makes a great point. I pursue this concept in what I call ""elegant design"". What this means to me is taking as much functionality as possible and putting it into a simple to understand package. There is a huge difference between ""intuitive"" and ""Dumbed down"". Want some exapmles? Think Apple products or, online, facebook. Both have a lot of features available, but you aren't overburdened by them. You take what you need and you leave the rest. On top of that, both offer an intuitive GUI that is easy to comprehend. A lot of times this comes down to interconnecting all of the aspects of your system to be accessible where your users need them to be.<p>I feel this is an area Microsoft has struggled with in the past and they are finally catching up with their more recent Office program. A good case study here? Compare Microsoft Outlook to Gmail. Gmail is an elegant solution, Outlook is incomprehensible to the point that there are companies whose business is making it easy to understand (ie. Xobni).<p>There are many other examples, but I'm interested in what everyone else thinks too...",1265227119

Don't the involved parties want to protect their own interests as much as they can?<p>The way I read the MS and Apple licenses is that they are just covering their asses,  there is a greater than zero percent chance that there could be new MPEG fees that would make it unpalatable for them to continue to support it.  I suspect that neither MPEG nor Apple or MS or Adobe or really anyone wants that to happen.   At the same time the MPEG folks don't want to just take a one time fee and potentially leave money on the table.  It's somewhat open ended,  that's unsettling but how do you price that stuff?   You could do it per use but everybody seems to find that unacceptable, you could charge a percentage of profits but not many companies would go for that,  you could have a one time flat fee but that will usually be too large,  so you kind of have periodic re-evaluation.  For most users,  it seems like it's simply an issue between them and their vendor,  not MPEG.<p>Look at MP3,  it is patented.  Thomson has gone after companies and collected money on the patents.

A trend is emerging where Apple is starting to be harped at for their closed policies by more than just hackers. This could lead to a tipping point against them if the issue builds traction. The more content they get their hands on, the more regular users are noticing that they exert a lot of control over their content. For some, this will never matter, but the number of people who it does matter to appears to be increasing.<p>Aside from this, Spotify appears to be on the right tech trend: cloud computing. With Google prepared to release a cloud computing operating system, getting more and more info off of our computers and into a centrally located space seems to be the way to go. Why not just run Spotify and have an app that manages and streams my music from my phone? It means I don't really need a huge hard drive anymore. It's convenient because rarely do we just listen to the same limited playlist over and over again; people tend to enjoy a lot of variety in their music.<p>I believe Spotify is on trend, and this will give them the advantage in the future.

But it will be slow, and the resolution could be problematic when attempting to use an onscreen keyboard to edit dialog boxes in regular applications (assuming it can be done at all).",1265223837

You can't follow non-trivial C code without understanding pointers, or Prolog without understanding unification.<p>Syntax aside, the semantics of Python are intended to be unsurprising to people with a conventional programming background. I don't have any practical experience with Ruby, but it looks like a mishmash of Smalltalk and Perl to me, and I can usually get the gist of code snippets. Likewise, I can kinda-sorta follow written Dutch (since I've studied German and speak English fluently), but I wouldn't expect to be able to just read Thai.",1265223673
