1109009,comment,1108912,1108912,0,0,noonespecial,,,"Theist here:<p>Science and religion both address certain and different parts of our existence. Science is the tool we use to look at our universe and ask <i>what</i>, religion is the tool we use to look at our universe and ask <i>why</i>.<p>For example, science is perfect for looking at our earth and asking ""what is it, what caused it, what's in it?"" etc. Religion is perfect for asking ""why is there a universe at all?"" (or more succinctly, ""why is there something and not nothing?"")<p>The problems start when you use science, or religion to ask or answer the wrong questions.<p>Example: You can't use science to look for God because science only works on everything in the universe. If there is a God worth the title, he/she/it is not going to be in there. If you do, you're just going to find a whole lot of universe, like a character in ""the sims"" trying to use game elements to prove there's a player.<p>Example: You can't really use religion to ask where the earth (and life) came form (what caused it) because its just one link in a (perhaps limitless) cause-effect chain that is the universe, fully defined within its own context. If you do, you end up with a cartoon-like image of a tiny god, contained within the universe using his god-powers to create static creatures to try to outsmart the big bad universe. It might make you feel warm and fuzzy, but it doesn't do much for the concept of God.<p>The big problems come when people <i>militantly</i> use the wrong tool to answer a question. Then you get people staring up at stars that emitted their light 100 million years ago and insisting that it all started 6500 years ago, and insisting that they be allowed to teach that to your kids on your dime. And there begins the heavy twisting of mind.<p>If you carefully think about the goals you are trying to achieve with each, I don't feel that science and religion are fundamentally incompatible.<p>Edit: Had to search a bit for this Einstein quote but here is:<p>""There is no conflict between science and religion. Science asks what the world is, and religion asks what humankind and society should become"" - Albert Einstein",1265604766

Going long on gold is a bet on the collapse of the U.S. dollar as reserve currency and a fall back to some sort of international gold standard.  In such a case, it's price will go up by 10-100X.  If the U.S. tightens the money supply and returns to more responsible fiscal and monetary management, the price will drop dramatically.<p>The 25% in cash seems really high, especially for someone trying to live off $5 million.

When inflation actually happens (not just inflation expectations), interest-rates rise -- that is not spurious correlation, that is just rational market behavior.</i><p>In many cases (not always) inflation happens because of government subsidized credit expansion.  Because loans are subsidized, you can get high inflation but low interest rates.  This was the case from 2003-2008.",1265604764

Take a look at Rails blogs discussing the OSS packages they use: everybody cites the canonical version of the code and if that is on Github then they cite the page on Github, frequently to the exclusion of the author's post or page about it.<p>Related problem: Frequently authors don't have a substantive page about it.  That would be a mistake if you're trying for link equity or personal branding, in my mind.  Relatedly, I spent $250 on a logo.<p>I spent quite a bit of time on that project and wanted the various marketing benefits of it to accrue to me, not to Github.  So I put it on my site, not theirs.  Folks subsequently cloned the repository and put it in their Github accounts.  I am totally OK with that: mine is the canonical one and the canonical one gets the links, mindshare, etc.",1265604693

So, since the 25% that is in bonds is, presumably, a fund, they usually have a duration (interest-rate sensitivity) of around 5.0-6.0 (roughly equivalent to years). Add-in the same 25% allocation to cash (duration around zero), and you have a 50% bond allocation that is of duration around 3.0 - that is reasonable and happens to be the duration I target. However, 1) since I use individual bonds, I do not have the problem of realizing losses during rising interest-rates (laddered maturities, held to maturity), and 2) I manage the bond portfolio to capitalize on changing yield compensation for risk along the three dimensions of bond risk: credit, interest-rate (duration), and timing-of-cash-flow (ex. mortgage-backed securities) to achieve better fixed-income portfolios.<p>2) Gold of 25% is quite risky. A brief look at the historical volatility of Gold returns will show you that having such a large allocation to an investment class with such a high standard deviation increases portfolio volatility too much. Secondly, it is very difficult to determine when Gold is relatively ""rich"" or ""cheap"", because, unlike all other non-commodity investments that we all invest in, we cannot apply simple discounting math to either a) measure the market’s yield compensation for the risk (as with bonds), or b) measure the price relative to expected earnings/cash-flow (as with stocks) - Commodities have NO cash flows.<p>Last thought: What has been a better risk-adjusted hedge against inflation, Gold or 3-Month US Treasury Bills? Check it out. When inflation actually happens (not just inflation expectations), interest-rates rise -- that is not spurious correlation, that is just rational market behavior.",1265603126
