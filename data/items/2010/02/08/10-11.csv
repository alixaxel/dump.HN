So far, the only tool I can see is \ny vs x and thats not tough to do in excel.  I'm not saying  you aren't offering anything, but I don't know what it is.<p>For the interface, a few things I didn't like, but others can chime in.<p>1) When I click on ""Basic Statistics"" I see the tests there.  Then, when I click on ""Multivariate Statistics"" the basic title bar drops down to the bottom.  If I were trying to look for a test to use, I would want to scroll through each category.  They way you have it makes that tough.<p>2) When I go to analyze a data set, how do I get back to the list of files?  I figured it out (click on Data Management) but that should be easier to find.<p>Also, something that I think would be <i>very</i> cool would be to allow me to take data sets from different files.  This would allow me to use your app as a storage for my data sets.  I could organize files however made sense to me and then arbitrarily go there and look for correlations.

Then you'll have one problem for every 72 hours of constant use of all of your memory.<p>How much of your memory do you use on average? How many flipped bits will be read, before being overwritten? How many bit flips cause a real problem? If one of the gray background dots of HN turns blue, I don't really care.

1109455,comment,1109401,1109401,0,0,djcapelis,,,"I love ECC as much as the next guy, but the reality is that the entry overstates the importance of bit-flips by assuming the bits always flip in something that matters.<p>The simple fact is that most bit flips occur in portions of memory no one cares about.  If the error even manifests a lot of the time it'll just manifest as one pixel in some image somewhere changing color by one bit.<p>With the author's estimate of 1,000 bit flips over the lifetime of a computer, maybe 10 of them cause crashes.  Most of those crashes are likely to be a web browser on most people's desktops anyways, so if you just imagine you have the previous version of the flash player, you can simulate an increased SEU rate pretty nicely.<p>ECC is standard on servers because we assume the data they carry matters the large majority of the time.  We assume that server's typically have a larger portion of their memory devoted to ""important"" things.  (I.E. not images, video or stuff a javascript interpreter forgot to free().)  On desktops, it is still probably reasonable to purchase non-ECC hardware for the time being.<p>I agree with the author though, that this is only getting worse.  The trends are all in directions where this is going to start affecting consumer-level stuff at some point, but I'm not sure we're there yet.<p>As always, it's a matter of your workload combined with good risk analysis.",1265624772

A flaky machine will indeed see bit errors, and it will probably be visible as random crashes, but that's not even necessarily the case for the average machine. If you look at the quantitative study from Google, which the author links to:<p><a href=""http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~bianca/papers/sigmetrics09.pdf</a><p>... you can see that in terms of errors per DIMM:<p><i>""Across the entire fleet, 8.2% of all DIMMs are affected by correctable errors and an average DIMM experiences nearly 4000 correctable errors per year. These numbers vary greatly by platform. Around 20% of DIMMs in Platform A and B are affected by correctable errors per year, compared to less than 4% of DIMMs in Platform C and D. Only 0.05-0.08% of the DIMMs in Platform A and Platform E see an uncorrectable error per year compared to nearly 0.3% of the DIMMs in Platform C and Platform D. The mean number of correctable errors per DIMM are more comparable, ranging from 3351-4530 correctable errors per year.""</i><p>So the mean rate of correctable errors is high, but the variance is also very high: depending on the manufacturer, 80 to 96% of DIMMs see out a whole year <i>without a single correctable error</i>. If the original statistics of 95% chance of error in 3 days were correct, a single-DIMM machine ought to have approximately 0% (astronomically close to 0%) of living out a whole year without errors - but we can see here that you seem to have between 80 and 96% of single-DIMM machines doing just that.<p>The moral here is to test your memory for a while - preferably a few days - before trusting the DIMMs. But once you know you have good DIMMs, it doesn't look like you need to be quite so paranoid about bit errors.",1265624041
