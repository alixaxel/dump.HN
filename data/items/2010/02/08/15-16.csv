This needs to be soooooo easy to use.  Which it is, to the extent that it is a webapp.<p>This really somehow needs to get turned into a mobile app, which will remind you to do the checks, and prompt you for a reading.  If you were to provide a simple web API, I would probably be plugging into it tonight on Palm.<p>If this app texted me, and I could respond with readings, I would be in love.<p>Particularly for basal tests and bolus tests on an insulin pump, prompted readings with a dead simple interface are key.  When you are supposed to be doing this 5 times a day, you are going to be as expedient as possible.  This is the primary problem with logging systems.  Personally I either forget, or don't want to run upstairs every time.<p>The only real missing feature of note is the lack of an interface for basal and bolus testing.

1109940,comment,1107742,1109367,0,0,jimbokun,,,"How about this:<p>Ruby's syntactic flexibility and semantic model mean that many cases handled by a change to the language spec or delegating to another language (XML config files, for example) can be cleanly handled in Ruby itself.

1109913,comment,1109624,1109624,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Which leads me to my final point. Markets set rates. Banks don't and governments don't. Banks and governments certainly impact rates and governments can do a lot to impact rates and they do all the time. But at the end of the day it is you and me and it is the traders, both speculators and hedgers, who determine how much of a discount we'll accept to get our money now and how much interest we'll want to wait another year.<p>Technically that's a true statement, but in practice governments can set interest rates as artificially low as they want.<p>How they do this: Government officials can lend money to banks at less than the rate of inflation. That makes it in a everyone's interest to borrow as much as they can and buy any hard asset remotely likely to appreciate or even hold its value with it.<p>The inflation becomes a self fulfilling prophecy at that point. More money comes into existence by being lent, it's immediately put into chasing hard assets, which increases the price of assets. Which then makes it make sense to borrow money and buy hard assets with it, because next year the asset will be worth more than the loan because of the inflation.<p>Long story short - technically sorta true, but governments can reduce interest rates dramatically at the expense of inflation, which then becomes cyclical. More inflation means more demand for lower interest rate money, which means more inflation. The author's point is correct in theory, though in practice governments can set interest rates basically as artificially low as they want. (Getting them artificially high doesn't seem possible in the current generally practiced monetary/banking/legal/tax systems)<p>So - correct in theory point, but in practice governments who control fiat currencies can set interest rates as low as they want (albeit it with some nasty side effects).",1265644037

There are four categories - $5K, $25K, $50K, and $250K - and Pepsi will be taking submissions every month throughout the year! I'm currently in the running for a grant and thought that I should pass the funding idea along to other social entrepreneurs. It's obviously not all about the money, but seed capital certainly helps!<p>If you're interested in taking a look at one of the grant submissions, feel free to check mine out (and maybe vote too!): http://bit.ly/aGPq9u<p>A shameless plug for my project:<p>I've been working on a music education project called Chromatik (www.chromatikmusic.com). It's a collaborative online home for music education, for students of all genres and experience levels, that provides study tools while also capturing the arts advocacy conversation. Music education has been a huge passion of mine, and I'm seeking to really shake up how students get their study tools, collaborate, and approach learning.<p>Chromatik's floated around from 6th to 29th place already out of 300+ proposals in our category, and it's been a totally viral effort...which speaks to the interest in music education and (hopefully) the coolness of the project at hand.
