The explanation is in the article:<p><a href=""http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/gamma.html#explanation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.4p8.com/eric.brasseur/gamma.html#explanation</a><p>Basically, if you have a test image which consists of alternating black and white, it should have the same perceived brightness when you scale it down - but when you scale it down, the software needs to average out the black and white. If it does a simple arithmetic average, it'll probably choose 127,127,127 once it's downscaled enough to become uniform in color. But if you compare that uniform color with the original black and white lines, it looks a different shade - a darker shade. That's because 127,127,127 isn't 50% grey, it's not in the middle between black and white.<p>The article has further explanation.",1279414386

However, there is an unscheduled drug called <i>adrafinil</i> (marketing name Olmifon), which directly metabolizes into modafinil (though it does take longer and has a higher risk for liver damage.) It is also considerably less expensive (though you have to take a multiple of a dose to receive a similar effect.) Here are some reports from individuals that have used it from Erowid's Experience Vaults, including those who compare it to modafinil. <a href=""http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Adrafinil.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Adrafinil.shtml</a><p>Adrafinil isn't readily available in stores in the US, but is available by mail order by vendors such as QHI and the like. You can also get modafinil this way as this guy did, but it runs the risk of getting caught at customs, so I can't suggest it.<p>As for other nootropics, some people have gotten results form the racetam class of drugs (which include, in rough order of intensity, piracetam, oxiracetam, aniracetam, pramiracetam, and others) that some users have reported benefits from and that have extremely few reports of side effects, even with high doses. Some side effects include headaches from (primarily) piracetam (aka Nootropil), which is usually solved by taking it with choline. Some sellers sell gelatin tablets with piracetam and choline. Piracetam and all of the other racetams are relatively inexpensive and obtainable without a prescription, i.e. it is unscheduled. However, the general consensus is that the effects are rather subtle and the tolerance builds up quickly, though some people have experienced significant gains from it.<p>There are always, of course, drugs like Adderall and Ritalin which are under prescription that also have various side effects but are effective for an enormous amount of those who require it. There are also other OTC products like vinpoectine, which is a vasodilator which is an ingredient in some mind supplements such as Think Gum and others.<p>There are a lot of nootropics and it's fascinating to read and learn about them and their mechanisms of action.<p>EDIT: here are some more interesting things you might want to read. PubMed has a long document about modafinil, precautions, guidelines, and its side effects [1].

Contact their CEO and pitch him/her over the phone on endorsing your business for their business people to use. Maybe price it to the public at $X, but for them special deal ""today only"" $X-$y. Let them contact their people and do brochures or whatever it is they want to do to promote it.<p>Powercall 10 of these places in 1 day and see if you can get through to the CEO's and get some heat built up for your business. Basic business to business. Offer them the special price for a $10,000 fee to make sure they will follow through on their end. Be ready to close the deal, and be ready to bill for the fee if you get any takers.",1279411315

You don't <i>have</i> to see them unless you're looking for them! However, we realise people might need to see the entire list, so you can search for * or ""http"" to get a list of your bookmarks. The * search is a bit broken right now, but we are working to fix it.<p>2) Facebook posting is also planned!<p>3) Thanks for that idea, I will add it to our tracker!<p>4) That is also a good idea, we will have to resend you a validation email but that's fine. OpenID would also be great, we want to support it very very much and will do after the high-priority items are sorted.<p>5) A Firefox extension is planned, but is lower priority right now. Any volunteers who wanted to write an open source extension would be welcome!<p>6) You are probably getting a 3 because you are forgetting the ""agent"" parameter, if everything else is correct. We do need example, though, thanks!<p>7) Who wants to clutter the UI? :P<p>We'd love some help, and would be glad to recommend you! Please contact me at stavros at historious if you'd like. Also, thank you for the Mozilla link, I wasn't aware of that and it is very useful.",1279411314

I discovered his site probably four years ago or so and it really opened my eyes to the capabilities of the language.  I think anyone who wants to learn more about JavaScript should definitely include Crockford in his studies.",1279411289
