I'd expect it to improve over time. In a similar fashion to them addressing ifequal and ifnotequal in 1.2.<p><i>Capitalization or minor string manipulation in erb doesn't require one to write a template filter function somewhere else.</i><p>Personally I'd prefer defining it once somewhere. Then use the function everywhere. Even with the initial code cost.<p>I think this is from past bad experiences. I once ""repaired"" a million plus line of code enterprise app that had misused some open source code that did date and number coercion (similar to django.contrib.humanize but for ASP). Needless to say the code was a mess and nearly the same code had been mixed in all over the place. The template code, the backend business logic and the asp C# files. After a few days of regexing then testing then fixing then searching then repeating. And then dealing with all the edge and special cases - I'll take a simple defined template function. All that being said - my example is a gnarly enterprise example involving bad code monkeys. So take it with a grain of salt - it's likely that the story isn't applicable to a lot of people here. But still - lesson learned. In the future designers can request template improvements and I'll deliver.",1280120340

It's also the problem which many of the people who are against AirBnB and similar sites are thinking of; there is a world of difference between a group of tourists given free reign in an apartment and one or two tourists renting a bedroom from someone who is living in and present in the apartment. This difference is perhaps why so many of the people who have tried such services are in favor of it; they have been in the latter situation, which seemed quite pleasant to them and which was completely preferable to hotels (all of the stories I've heard of users of such services describe this situation). The people who are angry about it (outside of the hotel industry) without actually coming into contact with it (short-term renting of the adjacent apartment, with whatever results) are thinking of the first situation.</i><p>Dear god  I read your entire post only to realize you entirely agree with the legislation that was just passed only you have no idea what the new law means.",1280120289

No; in fact, it's far easier. I have used PostgreSQL for many years and in all of them every question I've had has been answered quickly and properly by somebody in #postgres who knows way more about postgres and SQL than I'd ever even <i>want</i> to know.<p>And what about hires? When a million people ""know"" MySQL it takes a lot more effort to find somebody who actually <i>does</i>. There may be fewer contractors for PostgreSQL but they are practically by definition better than the average MySQL contractor.<p><i>unlike learning a programming language, with databases, the domain knowledge is harder to discover and more risky if you don't understand it</i><p>Exactly.

Operated like a cheap hotel. I can see why the government may want to regulate that.<p>An easy way to distinguish the above situation from legitimate friends staying over, is to ask for the owner to be present. Or couchsurfing. That tends to make it a more casual and better controlled environment. I can understand why the government may want to stay out of this.<p>My impression is that the real criteria should be how much the room is rented: if you have guests 300 days a year, you should be regulated. If it's 10 days, leave me alone. The problem is that it's probably hard to define, and may impose its own set of requirements (such as, everyone would have to keep a registry of all visitors, just to prove that they don't fall into the hotel category).",1280119473
1547164,comment,1547005,1547005,0,0,solost,,,"My first suggestion is to make sure that you have some type of portfolio even if it is small.  In my experience a lot of web designers create their own brand around their name and have a site with their portfolio.  I'd then make sure you have some decent business cards so that when you start attending local events you have something to leave with prospective customers.<p>In most decent sized cities there seem to be numerous networking and small business events that are usually free or have only a modest fee to attend.  I recommend checking the local chamber of commerce as well as using Google to locate them.  Sites like <a href=""http://www.networkingphoenix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.networkingphoenix.com/</a> in Phoenix have a lot of events where you can get out and meet small and large business owners.<p>If that isn’t your style there are numerous websites advertising the need for talent to do one off projects.  The issue with many of these sites is they want a lot for a little.  But if you need experience, want to build your portfolio and or don’t mind working cheap then this might be a good route to start.<p>From there it is up to you.  Also remember as you start getting clients, make sure you give them the best possible service as over time they can become your best source of business.

1547161,comment,1546958,1546958,0,0,DenisM,,,"Reposting my own answer here, maybe it will spark a discussion:<p>Suppose you have an ordered set, which you also want to modify by adding and removing elements. Further, you need ability to retain a reference to an element in such a way that later you can get a previous or next element. For example, a to-do list or set of paragraphs in a book.<p>First we should note that if you want to retain references to objects outside of the set itself, you will likely end up storing pointers in the array, rather than storing objects themselves. Otherwise you will not be able to insert into array - if objects are embedded into the array they will move during insertions and any pointers to them will become invalid. Same is true for array indexes.<p>Your first problem, as you have noted yourself, is insertion - linked list allows inserting in O(1), but an array would generally require O(n). This problem can be partially overcome - it is possible to create a data structure that gives array-like by-ordinal access interface where both reading and writing are, at worst, logarithmic.<p>Your second, and more severe problem is that given an element finding next element is O(n). If the set was not modified you could retain the index of the element as the reference instead of the pointer thus making find-next an O(1) operation, but as it is all you have is a pointer to the object itself and no way to determine its current index in the array other than by scanning the entire ""array"". This is an insurmountable problem for arrays - even if you can optimized insertions, there is nothing you can do to optimize find-next type operation.",1280119319

I'm intentionally being as vague as possible to remain anonymous.<p>My plugin was on the market for about 9months. In that time, my revenue was in the $60k range. The sale price was around 6x the revenue. However, it was spread out over a few years of me being employed by the purchaser. Of course, I got a nice salary in addition to the purchase price.<p>One thing that made my situation interesting is that a competitor of the product I plugged in to was interested in me doing the same thing for their product. Once they got wind of the negotiations, they immediately made me an offer. It turned into a bidding war for my IP/company.<p>My observations from what you've described:<p>you will almost certainly be expected to work for the purchaser since it sounds like you are the sole developer. They are essentially buying your services and the IP. So don't give them a reason to be wary of you working for them.<p>On what to ask for: Unless you have revenue, there is no way to objectively quantify at least a minimum value of your IP. There is an art to negotiation that is beyond this post but you've already got them to admit that you will make them millions. I think that is an excellent start. The best negotiators are willing to walk away from the deal. Determine a minimum you want ahead of time and then be prepared to walk away if you don't get it.<p>If you just want out then act accordingly. Give them a price that you know will keep them interested.<p>In my case, it took several months between the initial exchange of interest and serious negotiations to begin. They first contacted me in January, An email with an offer price arrived out of nowhere in May.<p>What I would do differently:<p>I would have asked for an earn-out instead of a flat price. I didn't know about this until I talked to a few other entrepreneurs. Basically, you give up guaranteed money for a cut of the action from your IP. You're assuming part of the risk. Big company with big marketing budget drives your product to success and you get a cut. It's a very common thing in product acquisitions.<p>When the competitor made an offer, I disclosed the other company's offer. I should have let them make me an independent offer. Even though there was a bidding war, the price stayed pretty close to the initial offer by the first company.",1280118777

I love to code, I love to solve problems and very much love & enjoy my job. From time to time, though, I work on projects outside of the office. The company owner has made it clear that as long as it doesn't negatively impact the job, there isn't an issue. Any agreements I have signed don't have any restrictions on not working outside of the office.<p>So here is my question: Is it ""kosher"" to go about working on semi-related projects and putting them under my name? For example, a ""graph data format"" for use with ProtoVis <http://vis.stanford.edu/protovis/> for passing graph data from the backend through to the JavaScript graph generator. Did I build it for work? Not directly. I see the need and am developing it. Will it make my life at work easier? Most likely as it so happens I have decided to use ProtoVis in a work project.<p>So, HN'ers. Where and how do you draw the boundary line for working on projects related to your work? Aren't so many businesses built on the idea of seeing something that can be made better and doing that?<p>Thanks!",1280117491

It just confused him and nothing worked without first taking some action or involved explanation. It was all just too much for him.<p>I installed OSX 10.5 [1]. I told him the only rule is no Apple Software Updates (until I had a chance to patch it). It was my nth attempt to get him to leave Windows and it finally worked. After some massaging by me - Everything just worked. Maybe not the same way - but it worked. And it was more productive than using his old borked windows install. When linux can provide a similar experience they will gain (more) traction. I don't agree with Dell dropping Linux but I understand it. I can just imagine all the confused users calling in because they can't install some windows game or windows program.<p>There was another reason the Mac didn't happen sooner. Price. There was no way he was going to shell out for a mac. He had the money. He just couldn't justify spending 3x to get a Mac. We'll see if price is still an obstacle now that he's a daily Mac user. And this is another (obvious) strong point for Ubuntu. In my opinion they've done a good job leveraging ""being free"" in the netbook market where 25% of the cost can be the OS (/cough Windows).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mydellmini.com/forum/mac-os-x/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mydellmini.com/forum/mac-os-x/</a>",1280117490

1547118,comment,1546500,1546984,0,0,rdl,,,"Which specific actions in this set of documents do you think were incidents of indiscriminate or careless killing?<p>There were definitely a bunch of cases of needless (in retrospect) killing, but those were generally mistakes, vs. conscious policy.  Given that it is a war zone, and information is imperfect, but that inaction would have its own costs, I haven't seen a lot of cases of seriously bad activity.  There is also a gray zone between illegal and unjustified; the few genuinely illegal actions have generally been prosecuted and punished by the military.  There were other cases where ""bad"" things happened which were not illegal, but where the policy was changed as a result to prevent those things.<p>For instance, due to the incidents such as the madrasa night attack in J-Bad, special operations night raids were sharply limited in 2009 (per GEN McChrystal), and the rules for the use of airstrikes and artillery fires were substantially tightened.<p>Internal to the military, people don't really cover up this information -- it feels into the process of changing policies.  Compared to most companies, lower ranking military people are fairly willing to report bad news up the chain of command (still not perfect, but more so).  Almost all of this is ""hidden"" behind security classification, maybe too much so -- which makes people outside the military assume mistakes are intentional and not being corrected.  There is a compelling argument for aggressively declassifying information as quickly as possible, positive or negative.",1280117312

Change your location. I get easily distracted and waste time at home, but am super vigilant if coding at coffee shops even though there are technically more people talking and more distractions.

Turn your internet off. Most laptops have a physical switch to turn your wireless on and off quickly.

Minimalize your desktop and browser home page as much as possible, so you start of by doing what you want not whats in front of you.<p>Psychotherapy is great for reducing the misery of the severely depressed people, but it won't help you with general 'distractability'.
