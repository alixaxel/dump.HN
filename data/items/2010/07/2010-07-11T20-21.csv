You are essentially the ultimate all rounder - you must have extensive product knowledge, great communications skills, good sales awareness, marketing skills, work with the development team and services too - so you can then go into any of these directions actually very easily.  I worked in presales for about 6 years and personally moved into product management which I love. If I wanted to I could move into development but I don't had those skills - but if I found a developer with a presales background I would snap them up immediately - would be a killer skill set combo; or a perfect startup founder.<p>So yes, I completely agree that SE or presales is the perfect job to do to get exposure to nearly all functional areas of business.  And that is ideal for 'founder training' or simply if you don't know where you want to end up so want to learn what each part of the business is like.",1278881516

""If we believe something about the world, we are more likely to passively accept as truth any information that confirms our beliefs, and actively dismiss information that doesn’t""<p>The point by both cognitive scientists and political scientists is this determination to believe something is completely sincere, not about deliberate deceit or spinning (though that does occur, it's a different phenomenon ).

WikiLeaks sent people to Baghdad to meet the children who were in the van that was shot by the Apache. That's investigative journalism, and it's laudable.<p>If the Pentagon shows you footage of a combat operation in which insurgents are hiding in a building that is seconds later destroyed by an Hellfire missile and they tell you that there were no civilian casualties, you may believe they're telling you the truth. If someone investigates the attack and finds out there were non-combatants in that building and that the Apache attack was a stupid abuse of force, later releases footage with captions suggesting a version of the facts different from the Pentagon's, then such editorializing is not bias, it's an accurate portrayal of the facts. The problem is that when the mainstream media is so biased and people have grown accustomed to it, then a cold-blooded depiction of the facts may look as an attempt to manipulate people's opinions, as if telling the truth were propaganda.<p>Lastly, Assange is burning bridges wherever he goes, and he's probably not making that much money.

1506081,comment,1505792,1505792,0,0,grellas,,,"The theme of this piece is that democracy itself is premised on the idea of an enlightened citizenry, or at least one capable of becoming enlightened through the spread of information. The unstated premise is that rule by elites may be preferable to rule by the people if science should someday discover that average people will be irredeemably swayed by their prejudices and will not make their political decisions based on their intellects. The remaining unstated premise is that good government will follow when people can think like policy wonks and can accurately absorb and act upon detailed factual information about their government.<p>I think all this misses the point of the U.S. system of politics. That system is based on a constitution adopted over two centuries ago and premised on the idea that good government consists of a government of limited powers with proper checks and balances in place to make sure it remains limited. The idea back then was to move away from the old systems of rule by royalty and to adopt a form of government that philosophically was based on the idea that all <i>legitimate</i> forms of power ultimately derived from the popular will but only as checked by systems that were designed to curtail the effects of mob rule, prejudice, and passions. Thus, the federal government was set up as a tripartite government, with a legislature, an executive, and a judicial branch. The legislature was to have a popularly elected component (the House of Representatives) but also one in the Senate that served to check the popular (Senators were not even elected by popular vote until the 20th century). The executive power was to be sharply curtailed by the specific grants given to it in the constitution and was not allowed to enact new laws but only to enforce those enacted by the legislature, with its tie to the popular will. The judicial branch, in turn, was to enforce the rule of law in a way that was far removed from popular sovereignty, with federal judges appointed for lifetime tenures (subject to approval by the Senate) and capable of being removed only on the narrow ground of committing an impeachable offense. Finally, with the federal power having been so defined and circumscribed, the constitution provided that all powers not expressly granted to the federal government were to be reserved to the states and to the people. A bill of rights was superimposed on top of all this, making clear that certain supervening rights of the individual could not be impaired by federal governmental authority (this eventually being broadened to encompass action by the states).<p>If you read the Federalist Papers, which were in essence arguments propounded at the time in support of adopting the U.S. Constitution, there is no naive assumption in these documents that pure popular rule would somehow become a pristine way of running a government. Indeed, it was just the opposite. In one after another of these documents, it is assumed that rule by pure popular will is basically evil and dangerous because people will be driven by baser motives to accomplish their ends. Thus, there is all sorts of concern about not allowing unswayed prejudices to run unchecked through the course of government. The point of the arguments was to <i>recognize</i> that this is the reality of how people think and act and to set up a system that deals with it while preserving freedom and holding public officials ultimately accountable to the people.<p>I think this system ultimately had a theistic base in a Judeo-Christian tradition that saw man as a fallen and fallible creature who was prone to all sorts of mischief when given a chance. This may be open to debate but it certainly was one important component of that era. In any case, the founders appeared to have no assumptions about the ability of people to rule themselves based on becoming progressively enlightened. Their approach was realistic and pragmatic and dealt with how to contain power so that it does not corrupt those given the authority to rule.<p>This piece has interesting elements in it about how people resist changing their minds based on new information but I think it is off in its implications of what this means for good government.",1278880915

I have had a general preconceived notion that the iPhone has a superior UI to Android--probably due more to reading about it than to actually using the device--and I was shocked at how much clunkier the iPhone 3G felt as compared to the Nexus. Scrolling and zooming were slower, the GPS indicator of position felt significantly laggier than on the Nexus, and the screen was a lot less crisp and bright. And that's not even getting into the fact that the ""car navigation"" feature on Android is far superior than what the iPhone was capable of displaying.

Apple has always provided a more consistent environment to develop against than Microsoft did/could (because Apple controls the hardware), and there's always been both more developers and more software for Windows.  One could play the quality card here, but all that matters is the quality of the apps that are used and that there is a demand for, not the average quality of all apps ever.  No one cares if a Homer Simpson soundboard app is of low quality.<p>That the official twitter app couldn't run on 27.3% of Android owners most likely reflects more on the developers of the app than on the platform (or on the schedule the developers are working against).  ""Serious developers"" for a platform ensure that their product sufficiently meets their target market (the ""27.3% of android owners"" number assumes that 100% of android owners even wanted to run the official twitter app, the way you've worded it).  This is pretty straight forward to do with Android: acquire and test against all the popular devices out there.  You can even run and compile against older versions of the SDK without issue.  Sure, this is more work, but that's your target demographic and it's something that people have been doing for at least as long as Windows has been popular.

So it is possible to eavesdrop on subvocalization (NASA has experimented with this -- see wiki article).<p>Some people naturally don't subvocalize because of learning disabilities; they usually have trouble writing and speaking because they have to translate their thoughts into English.<p>Of course the idea that you are thinking <i>in</i> a language is rather terrifying. Consider how it is moulding your thoughts. The idea that language effects your thoughts is called the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.

Another $360 billion -- over 11%, went to a category Wikipedia calls ""Unemployment/Welfare/Other mandatory spending"", which appears to include ~$40 billion in unemployment compensation, at least $100 billion in ""other income security"", and $100 billion in food and housing assistance. Again, most people would consider most or all of this spending 'welfare'.<p>Even Social Security and Medicare -- as they often subsidize the spending of people with more money than they've paid in, especially low-income people -- have at least some component that would be fair to consider 'welfare'. Together, they are over $1.3 trillion of the federal budget -- more than 40%.<p>A plain English definition of 'welfare' from Princeton's WordNet is ""governmental provision of economic assistance to persons in need"". From the items listed above, one could easily make the case 15%-40% of the federal budget fits that definition.<p>And this is without even going into subsidies for the middle-class and corporations -- the home mortgage interest tax deduction, cash-for-clunkers, financial bailouts, farm subsidies -- which are also economic assistance, and ostensibly justified because the recipients are said to have some pressing need, and sometimes archly labeled 'welfare'.<p>(While I've used 2009 numbers, the 1999/2000 numbers -- when the Kuklinski UIUC study was published -- aren't <i>that</i> different in overall proportions.
