That's something that must grow with time. From my experience, even going in with the idea that I might get into a serious, long-term relationship with someone, there's a hurdle that I must overcome before I can get a girl to desire a deep emotional connection. The ""game"" is one means of overcoming that hurdle. Yes, it means adjusting your personality to fit the circumstance, but I do that all the time. Is that somehow uncouth to do so when the end-goal is a romantic relationship instead of getting funding, finding a job, making a new friend, or any other potential scenario that involves another person/people?",1279087044

1513738,comment,1512714,1513470,0,0,photon_off,,,"Hi Matt.  First off, thank you for coming forth to make a statement about this vulnerability.  It's nice to see that fb is responding to these incidents, and since you care, I'll work with you to solve the problem.<p>But first, let me express how disconcerting I find it for facebook to ""pass the buck"" on the blame of this vulnerability.  It's not a browser vulnerability to have personal information be shared by implementing a ""1 click publishing"" button via a cross-domain iframe that (often times unknowingly) has a user logged into another site -- it's a privacy vulnerability that you need to take care of.  As of late, I see no way that I can disable ""liking"" stuff, and I'm aware of the vulnerability, so I stay logged out of Facebook as often as I can.<p>It's facebook's decision to use an iframe, to publish content to user's news streams in 1 click, and to allow any website to implement the like button.  It's your decision in spite of knowing that the means of doing so are open to ""vulnerabilities"" such as linkjacking.  I put ""vulnerability"" in quotes because it's not really a vulnerability, now is it?  It's a fundamental possibility based on how HTML works -- links can be invisible!  Calling ""linkjacking"" a vulnerability is like calling tracking pixels, sessions in URLs, or anything that can be used for ill purposes, a ""vulnerability"" that browsers need to take care of.  I'm not buying it.  It's part of the design of HTML and you need to work with it.<p>You could easily remedy the situation by ensuring the user really means to publish something.  However, I realize you aren't going to change anything about the ""liking"" process because it will disincentivize publishers from including it if it's not as effective.  Business first, I understand.<p>Luckily, I will share with you, for free, how to fix this issue.<p>You can detect whether or not an iframe is being invisibly dragged by polling the cursorX and cursorY (which are relative to the browser window itself, not just the iframe) in conjunction with whether or not the user's mouse is over the ""like"" button (simple onmouseover/onmouseout).<p>If the user's mouse is over the ""like"" button even as X and Y dramatically change (optionally, over some unit of time) then the iframe is being positioned according to the mouse movements.  A click on the ""like"" button should be disabled, and you should discretely notify your server that the URL/domain is suspect.<p>If the attackers were smarter, they'd position the ""like"" button below the mouse only on an onmousedown event so that your detection script wouldn't catch on to the one sudden movement of the ""like"" button in time for when the user lifts the button of their mouse.<p>But, luckily, you'd have me to tell you to ensure that both onmousedown and onmouseup are fired before actually having the ""like"" button signal a click.<p>So, there you have it.  A free solution to your problem.  That worked out much easier than posting a puzzle on your jobs page and waiting for people to solve your problems that way.<p>PS:  For some reason as I read my post I realize that I come off as quite arrogant and perhaps a bit angsty.  I apologize for that... it's almost embarrassing.  I think it's just really late and I felt like being really frank about the issue.  At any rate, you guys should hire me.",1279086691

People almost never fully emergency brake, even in actual emergencies. More often than not people feather the brake and then press it harder if they found that the car was not braking as it should, continuing until they are pressing the brake harder than they would normally ever press it but not necessarily as hard as they possibly could. In such a scenario, a very realistic scenario, it might be possible that the car would still accelerate at full throttle.<p>Not that I'm saying that's what happened, it appears not, but it's not terribly outside the realm of possibility.",1279086589

1513732,comment,1512928,1513230,0,0,dkersten,,,"Having recently had to do some crazy commandline-fu (powershell and cmd.exe) to fix my Windows install, I have to say that there really is no comparison - linux wins hands down. Sure, part of it was familiarity, but it felt so clunky and awkward that I don't think thats all it was. The flexibility of bash, awk, sed, grep etc etc cannot be overstated, IMHO.<p>On another front, I've found Linux to be time saving, compared to Windows. For example, on a new install, on Windows I now have to hunt for the software I need from lots of different locations, download each one manually and install each one manually (and its impossible or awkward to automate, so you have to sit through a load of install GUIs - or switch CDs if its something proprietary that only comes on CD, though luckily I don't even remember the last time I had to do that, even my games are digital distribution games nowadays). On Linux, all the base stuff is ""probably"" (depending on your distro) already installed. The rest can be batch installed by a single command (pacman, apt-get, yum, etc) and you can then leave to do something else while you wait for it to install.<p>Similarly, Microsofts advertisements claim that Linux is difficult and time consuming to keep up to date - what with Windows Update and all. But we all know that on linux this is just a single command (pacman -Su, apt-get upgrade, etc) - this can, of course, easily be automated to run at certain times. Windows Update only updates Microsoft software - the Linux command will update all software installed through the package management system.<p>Of course, this doesn't invalidate the quote - you still spend time to make Linux do what you need, but you do on other operating systems too, so relatively to the non-free operating systems (which take the same or more of your time), Linux is, indeed, free.",1279086525

If you go to eco's website they specifically say this is a two stroke engine; the article linked has incorrect information.<p>They are reducing the amount of parts because they are using a two stroke instead of a four cycle.<p>It seems the only real cool part of this engine, to me, is that it is designed ""modular,"" it should be more cost effective to add on additional cylinders instead of having multiple facilities dedicated to different configurations.<p>Flat configurations have been used in cars and motorcycles for decades.",1279086035

You can ask for help on a mailing list or grab some BSD source code at your day job, but God help you if you do that in CS1 class.""<p>But if you need grab that BSD code in CS1, you sure as hell won't understand it. The other thing is that we can roughly equate ""being caught for cheating"" as ""being fired for incompetency"" in the workplace, so while the workforce has more lax attribution rules, the reason those attribution rules are there at university is intended to prevent the firing later on.<p>Having TA'd undergrads in a first year programming course (with GameMaker for a CS Game Design degree), the ones that hit trouble are the first ones that run to the Internet for help. They then cut and paste the code, don't understand it (they don't even realize that variables will need changing), and their coursework grades will suffer considerably. Sadly, it's only then that they come to the TA.<p>FWIW, my 2¢ says that the reason cheating is more rampant is because there are a lot more students who just don't want to be there; they've arrived at university because ""that's what you do."" They don't put effort into learning, because they're not learning for any life value, as soon as they have the degree certificate the major could have been anything.<p>That said, it could be worse in the US than it is now. When I lived in New Zealand, the incidence of cheating amongst foreign (read: Asian) students was a source of great alarm, the figures were pretty stratospheric. It was partly cultural, as they were never taught that it was a big deal to not copy verbatim someone else's work, and it was partly because they didn't care at all, they'd been sent there to learn English and get a degree from an English speaking school. How they reached that point was academic (pun unintended).",1279085898
