1506022,comment,1505157,1505881,0,0,Rod,,,"Assange is aiming at maximum impact. He knows human nature well enough to understand that people love polarization, and he exploits human weaknesses in order to accomplish his goals. Who has ever heard of Cryptome or Steven Aftergood? Very few. By contrast, everyone knows Assange these days. You may find his approach distasteful, but you can't claim it's not effective.<p>In any case, why shouldn't the ""collateral murder"" video have been editorialized? I don't care if the soldiers were obeying the ROE and had the right to defend themselves. They still are the invaders, and the invasion is still illegal. Ultimately, I don't blame the soldiers, for they were following orders. I blame the American people for blindly trusting their government and failing to demand accountability from the morally challenged elected officials. A docile populace is the first step towards tyranny.<p>If Assange stokes the masses and gets people angry, I am perfectly fine with that. Anger in the face of tragedy is preferrable to utter indifference. If Assange is self-aggrandizing and has an agenda, I am fine with that too, for he has done a great job so far and it would be enormously unrealistic to demand zero self-interest from a person who has amassed such immense power in such a short period of time.",1278877985

Partly it is because I used to spend a lot of time in #sqlalchemy, #pylons, #pocoo, #python, and #postgresql on freenode (I'm 'ltbarcly' on freenode, feel free to msg me HNers!).  For some reason it is common to believe that you can sit down and write applications that use an ORM and relational database without knowing both the ORM and relational databases.<p>If you are going to use relational databases, you should be prepared to become an expert in SQL, Database drivers, unicode (and why utf-8 or any other encoding isn't the same as <i>unicode</i>, in the same way that jpg or gif isn't the same as <i>image data</i>), indexing, data types, normalization tradeoffs, transaction isolation levels, locking semantics, ACID tradeoffs, how to read and understand query planner output, and much more.  This is a lot to know, but if it were a college class it would be less than a semester long.<p>If you are going to use an ORM you have to know <i>everything</i> you would need when you use a relational database, and in addition how and when the ORM performs queries, how it maps to the database, what queries it will produce and when for any given action or attribute access, how db transactions map into the orm operations, how to perform common SQL operations via the orm (rather than loading more data than you need and filtering or joining via the application).",1278876953

Operating on query results WITH Ruby is easy.  Writing relational queries AS ruby is a big impedance mismatch.  There isn't a simple mapping I can hold in my head.  Here there be magic, in the form of implicit joins.  Also, good luck trying to optimize.<p>It's not that I've decided it will leak, it's that I can never quite trust that it won't.  I would have to continually prove to myself that my code is right.  It's a weakness of mine that if I don't 100% understand the code I'm writing, I worry and that slows me down.  That code becomes something I can't quite get out of the back of my mind.<p>Also, I don't buy your readability argument.  I can read and think in SQL just fine.  Yes, SQL can be complicated, but only when the problem requires it.  It maps very directly and naturally on to the problem of querying.  There isn't much in SQL that isn't necessary.  There isn't much in SQL that is missing.  It's already as simple as can be.  To make it any simpler makes it worse.  Mixing the asking of a question with the processing of the answer makes both parts harder to understand.<p>Perhaps it is easier to read for some people, but I think that's likely because they just aren't very good with SQL yet.

In general (and more so today with spell check) I would say that no native speaker is thinking about the letters that compose a given word.... I'm sure that there are people who can recall words by thinking of the word as it's written- that sounds like one of those memory retention ""hacks"" I hear about sometimes.

It's not about helping the user, they don't send these types of things for users who are active on Facebook otherwise, but not directly interacting with you.<p>""Reconnect"" to a dead friend is pretty worst case, but it's also insulting to be told to ""reconnect with Bob"" when you go drinking with Bob every week.

Pro sales people are always trying to transition from their current state to the end state; they do it by brute force at every state in the machine, and often construct entire new subgraphs of the sales state machine so there are multiple transitions towards closing at every state. Pro sales people are also really good at qualifying opportunities and don't waste a lot of energy on weak prospects.<p>All of these behaviors are extremely aggravating (even moreso if you're a bystander watching it happen):<p>* They're always bugging people<p>* They're always asking for progress towards closing<p>* They evince no actual caring for the customer's problems (that's the SE's job!)<p>* They won't give the time of day to someone they've deemed unlikely to help them close a deal<p>Think of them like Hollywood agents, like Ari Gold from Entourage, and you're not too far off.

I can take some stabs at what doesn't work:<p>* Hiring people who have posted amazing stats inside other sales orgs but who have never done sole-starter early product sales<p>* Hiring people at moderate to high base pay to move an unproven product --- there are plenty of people who flit from role to role in gigs like this, never moving anything<p>* Hiring people for their rolodexes --- <i>every</i> A.M. can talk about a rolodex, and it almost never actually matters on the ground with your product<p>* Hiring ""strategic"" salespeople who don't want to cold call or do traditional sales but would rather spend their time on psuedo bizdev which, not coincidentally, can't easily be measured for varcomp or retention purposes<p>What I have actually seen work: learning how to sell, yourself, before bringing on a salesperson.<p>If you look around you'll probably find a couple dozen decent posts that address this question.",1278875005
