I wonder where the difference lies.<p>I do hope MS the best - the more competition we have in this sphere the better, and if the responsiveness/performance of the OS is as good as Engadget says, there will finally be some hard competition for the iPhone (Android is great, but I've yet to use one where the UI isn't sluggish, and it really detracts from the experience).",1279522787

1527853,comment,1526380,1526844,0,0,hristov,,,"This is a good point, but honestly I doubt this particular provision will be enforced by the courts.<p>If Thesis is to be held to this provision, it actually requires a contract formation, which means that the Thesis owners must have been aware of this GPL provision and must have intended to enter into a contractual relationship and all the other conditions of contract formations must have existed. This is really questionable. The Thesis owners could say that they were never aware of this provision and they never intended to be bound by it.<p>Of course if they say that, they will not qualify under the GPL, which may mean they are guilty of copyright infringement (if they do use GPLed code). But it is still possible that they can hold this position and accept their copyright liability (or perhaps try to use other arguments to deny their liability under copyright law). And if they do hold this position and if you have copied the Thesis code, then you are yourself guilty of copyright infringement and have no excuse.<p>So, I would not rely on section 5 of the GPL in this case.<p>This is all academic discussion, none of this is legal advice, and if you are actually considering using the Thesis software, please consult your own attorney.",1279522705

There are differences in IOS, Android, Blackberry and PalmOS but those differences aren't huge. If you use either of those devices/OS who should be able to pickup any of the other devices relatively easily. At least this has been my personal experience with Android, IOS and WebOS. What Windows Mobile 7 is doing is a fundamentally different way of how you use a mobile device. You could argue that when IOS was first introduced it was also a different way of how people uses mobile phones. But it was different in the sense that it was not confusing, it was very intuitive.<p>In contrast Widows7 mobile UI is a confusing mess and very bland to be honest. There no ""Wow"" factor. Who thought big blocks of animated tiles taking up huge screen real-state to be a good idea? I think this is also a good example of different design philosophy with MSFT and Apple. IOS with its new update introduced folder with the goal of giving you more screen real-state so that if you have a lot of apps you don't have to keep sliding and MSFT adds huge block of tiles (and animated!) that will require you to slide around to find what you need.<p>It would have made an interesting showcase for concept design that car manufacturers always make, but I don't see this being much practical at all.",1279522027

It could work well if the non-button actions (such as moving the watch close to the strap) are communicated effectively and are implemented perfectly, but if not, I can see a lot of confusion.</i><p>I find one button interfaces that trade buttons for time to be confusing and unintuitive.  The only way to operate them is by staring at them until they show the desired action.  You can't adjust it without looking at it at all (which may or may not be desired depending on the use case).  If you happen to miss the target action, you have to wait until the full cycle goes through again.  Sometimes they make it so you have to hold down the button to cycle and then release when you see the thing you want--if you miss it, you can't just release and start over, because releasing is going to select the wrong action.  This may not be the definition of unintuitive but it is the definition of annoying and inconvenient.<p>I had a pager back in the 90s that was billed as being easy to use because it only had one button.

1527805,comment,1527714,1527787,0,0,houseabsolute,,,"Well, well. I'm not sure about this. The reason he was sad that his competitors were going away is because it was evidence that his market was collapsing. I'm sure he would have been just fine with it if he was absorbing all the business his competitors had been doing and the overall size of the market was flat or expanding.<p>In many ways, your competitors are what's standing in the way of your success. You can tell yourself that you are trying to outdo yourself, but I don't think that Tiger Woods' primary motivation on the course is beating his last score. Beating another person is more deeply rooted in the human psyche.<p>Now, there are really only two paths to growth for a company: grow the market, or take share from your competitors. Even growing the market is normally in some sense taking business from other players in your segment. For example, if you grow a music business some of that is probably going to eat into other forms of entertainment. Witness the rise of the video games industry. And in many cases, the path to expanding the market is unclear or you do not have the skill to execute it, so the only thing left is to take business away from your competitors.<p>It's <i>possible</i> you could do that while still bearing them personal good-will. But I suspect that the human brain is going to experience a lot of cognitive dissonance in trying to say that on the one hand you like the people but on the other hand you're fine with hurting them or even putting them out of business. This is probably true even with the rationalization that you're doing what's best for the customer (which is not always true).<p>IMO you have a real problem when your employees stop <i>emotionally</i> disliking your competitors on average. That means that their products are so much better than yours that they overcome the natural distaste for ""the enemy"" or, even more reptilian, ""the man who wants to eat the food that I want to eat."" (That's why I think Google doesn't have much hope in the social space, because internally there's very little ill-will towards Facebook or Twitter. Apple is more of a contest.)",1279521084

Its unfortunate you could not see my original intent. I am not using the ""Mad men"" clip as a fool proof template to be used in conference rooms across the nation. I was simply trying to share some of Draper's fictional talents with others who have like interests. The clip shows a pitch with passion, emotion, personal connection, and knowledge of product. I feel these elements are worth noting if you have any entrepreneurial interests. I advise you think a little longer before responding to any more posts.
