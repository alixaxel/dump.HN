These are not well-known in the US, who tend to lump Europeans together (was IKEA from Sweden or Norway?) except for some simplistic stereotypes, i.e. Paris is the city of love, Germans make great cars, you can smoke pot in Netherlands, etc. etc. It's like the Chinese denoting all Europe as ""Westerners"".

Notwithstanding the claims of a variety of self-proclaimed experts, no good writer will omit adverbs, and no writer <i>can</i> successfully omit all adverbs without at the very least sounding incredibly choppy and awkward.  The author of the linked article included quite a few; even just counting those adverbs that end in ""-ly"", I found ten (fortunately\nmechanically\nreally\ngenuinely\npersonally\nfrequently\nunfortunately \nsolely\nrightfully\ntechnically), and there was even an adverb (""so"") <i>right there in the sentence where he was condemning adverbs!</i><p>As for the passive, the author acknowledges the difficulty of avoiding them, but claims that their removal is still an improvement, though without explaining why.  In fact, it makes the writing seem rather choppy (as if the author had to spend too much time paralysed by a set of rules to follow to actually be able to make the text flow).  And despite apparently putting in a great deal of effort to avoid them, the author <i>still</i> included at least two that I found in a quick reread: ""drawn for them"" in the ""beholder words"" section, and ""accepted for publication"" right at the bottom.  In both cases, the result is perfectly readable, not at all fuzzy, and entirely unremarkable---which shoots a rather gaping hole in the argument that there is anything wrong with a passive voice.<p>I feel sorry for his grad students, and only hope that when they come out the other end, they will sensibly discard the silly mandates of their advisor, rather than perpetuating the myths....",1279577824

1530350,comment,1529699,1530018,0,0,phreanix,,,"I think most people are just predisposed to share. Tumblr lets you do this quite easily and intuitively.  Not everybody gets it of course.<p>I think if I were to itemize the features that Tumblr does really well:<p>1. Feedback gratification.  I can't think of any other way to describe it.  The 'like' function lets you get instant feedback on what you shared, whether it's original content or reblogged content. The reblog function gives you even more gratification because it means what you posted was cool enough to be reposted.  Works great for attention-hungry teens (or people in general.)  This can get out of control when tumblrs decide they want to flame someone, multiple reblogs that escalate in online dickery sometimes ensues.<p>2. Tumblr not only lets you share content, it gives you things TO share through its ability to let you 'follow' other users and 'reblog' their content/posts.<p>3.  The tumblr timeline is like twitter on crack.  Imagine an endless scroll of content.  Funny stuff, serious stuff, links, images, porn, name it.  The dashboard gives an very easy way to reply to a post, like a post and/or reblog it.  (when I reblog a post, I make it a point to 'like' it, for example)<p>4.  On that, tumblr's got a pretty liberal policy on nudity, pornography, etc.  I'm surprised porn sites have not jumped on this yet.  The Suicide Girls, for example, have a tumblr, and their content gets reblogged a lot and consistently.<p>5.  Tumblr's also got a generally cool attitude towards its users.  No condescension, and their staff have their own tumblr blogs that are snarky and pretty funny.<p>6.  Tumblr activities.  This is something they've got over just about everyone except twitter.  Tumblr users create activities (one pretty fun one is 'topless tuesdays, I'll let ya'll figure that one out.) that many tumblr bloggers participate in, creating massive amounts of content.<p>That's just a few of the things that have made tumblr fun.  I'm basically on it all day, and have it set to send my posts to twitter.  Great way to find content, share content, and just dick around online.",1279577331

You have to be an expert in everything - tech issues, yes, but also farm issues, banking issues, environmental issues, taxes, poverty, unemployment, zoning, etc.  It involves walking door to door and telling people face to face that they should trust you and give you their vote and hopefully money and time.  You have to ask people for money - all the time.  You are asking for a job representing everyone around you, so it's hard to relax - you feel like you're slacking when you should be asking for votes or money or studying the issues.<p>It's also helpful to be very, very partisan.  If you're moderate, the people that volunteer for causes like yours will seem extreme for you and saying that people on the other side are not horrible people can lose you volunteers.  You have to juggle that.  If you think office politics or developer cliques are bad or distasteful, wait until you see what the political circles are like.  Everyone has an opinion (including people like us) and knows how everything should be run.  When you don't do what they suggest, they might leave.<p>I love the idea - obviously I invested a lot of my time in it.  I think technology can seriously improve our governance for the better and having tech aware legislators would be a good thing.  However, before you do it, know what you're getting into.  People think politicians are corrupt and stupid, but in general I think they're mostly smart, hard working and want to honestly help.   Running for office is complex, stressful and trying.  Before you throw your hat into the ring, contact someone you like, volunteer your time, help them understand these issues, build them these tools and convince them they are worth it.  You might be surprised how approachable many of them are.  Then, if you still feel the need to replace them, go for it.  And let me know, I'd love to hear about it.",1279577004
