I will never cease to see any relationship between humans, personal or professional, as a power game. Even if a couple has a deep emotional connection, the one who feels less intensely will have power over the other and be able to dictate the rules. It's the way it is.<p><i>""I would rather not date stupid and irrational women. I prefer women whom I actually like paying attention to. Especially for a lifetime commitment!""</i><p>I would rather not date stupid / irrational women, either! But the only women I know who are rational, smart, interesting to talk to are in their mid-30s and looking for a husband and father to their future children. Since I have some scruples left, I don't date women who want a family man, because I can't offer what they're looking for.<p>In any case, I challenge you to find a rational, smart 25 year old woman.

The problem with such generalizations is something rather simple; nature is not absolute. This works if women are absolute beings who care about nothing more than finding a secure man to breed with. There are women like that <i>and there are men like that too</i>, but it isn't a hard and fast rule.<p>Gender is in fact <i>a spectrum</i> and the idea of women you have in mind for whom such stuff works is only <i>a portion</i> of the total population. There are so many beautiful women and hawt men out there who want more to life than mindless pickups and sex.<p>Where do evolutionary generalizations come into over here? Think of it this way; you are beating billions of years of evolution every time you use a condom.<p>Yes, male and female brains are different, but there are fundamental differences <i>within</i> those sets as well (I am living breathing proof of this). So, maybe just maybe such things don't work in the longer term. As it assumes that both parties are in the ""game"" for something or the other.<p>What happens when you mature and you realize that you want <i>more</i>?<p>If you treat most women as objects of desire sooner or later your relationship will crash and burn. After all s/he is nothing more than a fancy toy for you. Emotions have to be <i>felt</i> not reasoned with.<p>I think that the most important discovery any of us can ever make is that; <i>love is not a noun but a verb</i>. It is something you have to work for. It simply doesn't ""just happen"". It takes years of emotional intimacy and mutual respect to have a relationship that can be classified as ""true-love"", and perhaps that is something worth the while in the longer run...<p>[edit: forgot grammar and spell check]",1279107582

1514263,comment,1513535,1514196,0,0,philwelch,,,"Your assumptions about my relationship are pretty deeply unfounded--I've never been forced to visit her family, nor do I hate her friends, nor have I ever been forced to visit them. There's no ""whipping"" involved--I'm every bit as free as I care to be.<p>It's not a question of power at all--we don't seek power over each other so much as we work hard to keep our autonomy while sharing our lives together. It's difficult, but it's worthwhile as well. Building a strong relationship that respects the freedom of each partner is just as hard as keeping up one side of a power game, but it's more fulfilling in the end. Knowing that someone else truly and deeply loves you is a very comforting feeling, especially when you both know it's mutual. Trying to withhold that satisfaction and make your partner insecure just to keep her (literally) on the treadmill is an asshole thing to do, but ultimately it hurts you too. Winning your power-game style of relationship would be hell to me compared to the relationship I actually have.<p>Look, I'll just address you point-by-point:<p><i>Moreover, if she's constantly terrified that you'll leave her if she gets fat, she'll exercize often and stay in shape, so that she can sexually arouse you for years to come, thus disincentivizing you from dumping her when she hits the magic 30-year-old mark.</i><p>Fat girls are underrated in my opinion, but there are plenty of strong women who can and do keep themselves in good shape for their own benefit. Of course, a self-starting woman like that is likely far too strong to put up with the kind of bullshit you're talking about.<p><i>You reciprocate by paying attention to her, by pretending to listen to her illogical / irrational arguments</i><p>I would rather not date stupid and irrational women. I prefer women whom I actually <i>like</i> paying attention to. Especially for a lifetime commitment!<p><i>and by abstaining from (too much) philandering</i><p>That's not a special favor; that's a basic part of being in a monogamous relationship. If monogamy is boring, have an open relationship and let the girl have some fun too. It might even spice up your sex life to have the odd threesome!<p>The kind of relationship you advocate might be the best you can get--it may be genuinely difficult to have a genuinely good relationship like I'm talking about--but personally speaking, if the best relationship I can get is some adversarial power game, I'd rather go completely without. I have no fear of dying alone--I am comfortable with the notion.<p>My personal suspicion: old married couples who treat their relationship like a power game are not happily married couples--they're like the couple in this story: <a href=""http://www.violentacres.com/archives/497/happily-ever-after/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.violentacres.com/archives/497/happily-ever-after/</a><p><i>Watching them was like watching a sick, evil little puppet show. He goaded her, she attacked him. He ignored her attacks, she escalated. Within minutes, dinner was ruined. They both looked supremely satisfied with this result.</i><p><i>Before I turned to leave, the man reached out with a bony, desperate hand and clutched my arm.</i><p><i>“Never, never get married,” he implored.</i><p><i>I looked at his wife. Instead of looking offended, her eyes widened in tentative agreement. A slight nod of her head was like the period on the end of his sentence.</i><p><i>That couple was trying to save my life.""</i>",1279107407

Being overly strict about this helps keep the place from devolving into a jokefest like so many other forums.<p>2) Some people will vote you down for complaining about downvoting.<p>I sympathize with both of these rules of thumb, for what it's worth.<p>EDIT: For some reason the ""reply"" link below your post is missing for me, so I'll just clarify a bit here, more than I usually would since this is a thread about gaming social norms. ;)<p>Rule of thumb #2 also stands for asking for clarification about downvoting. Especially when you do it 3 times: by editing your original post, then replying to it, and then editing the reply. And especially when you seem defensive about it.<p>Keep in mind that if you get ""downvoted into the basement"", it's not just one person downvoting you, it's at least 5. You've probably violated some implicit norm. Repeatedly asking for clarification is kind of its own awkward thing in these circumstances (especially with some manners of asking).<p>Imagine if you make a joke in a group of friends and people obviously don't think it's funny.

1514253,comment,1512930,1513835,0,0,masklinn,,,"In fact, to expand on the latter part of my comment, ""weak typing"" is generally understood as implying implicit type coercions or conversions at runtime. PHP and Javascript famously convert between numbers and strings depending on a bunch of factors (and usually the wrong way leading to unreliable results).<p>In that sense, Python is a very strongly typed language: from the top of my head, the only example of implicit type conversion in Python is the promotion of `int` to `long`, which has been removed from 3.x (all integer types were unified). All other conversions have to be explicit as far as I remember. That makes Python more strongly (but less statically) typed than Java (see the very strange overloading of the `+` operator when any operand is a string, as well as autoboxing since 1.5) and C# (C# allows for implicit type conversions, including in userland, and the cast operator doubles up as an explicit type conversion operator which I find terrible)",1279106839

It basically noted that almost all of the fatal accidents involved elderly drivers, who, presumably, would be more likely to get confused about which pedal they were pushing:<p>""In the 24 cases where driver age was reported or readily inferred, the drivers included those of the ages 60, 61, 63, 66, 68, 71, 72, 72, 77, 79, 83, 85, 89—and I’m leaving out the son whose age wasn’t identified, but whose 94-year-old father died as a passenger.""<p>""These “electronic defects” apparently discriminate against the elderly, just as the sudden acceleration of Audis and GM autos did before them.  (If computers are going to discriminate against anyone, they should be picking on the young, who are more likely to take up arms against the rise of the machines and future Terminators).""",1279105869

The ability to generate better hypotheses naturally results in less testing and generally more efficient use of resources.<p>How does one improve one's hypothesis-generation abilities? I have had many ideas in the past that never survived the ""customer discovery"" stage, simply because whatever I came up with did not seem to strike a chord with my target customers. A/B testing is theoretically good, but it's hard to generate hypotheses about why visitors are not converting.<p>What is your take on this?",1279105783
