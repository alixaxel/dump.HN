I think there's a place for more social networks, if we redefine ""social network"" a little.<p>What there are are tons of communities, any of which a given user may or may not be a member of... and as long as people prefer to show a different face when interacting with a given community, or keep their interactions with the members of a given community separate - whether as a convenience, or for privacy reasons, whatever, there will be room for ""social networks"" around interests, geographic areas, etc.<p>So, yeah, a ""social network"" for Doctor Who fans, a ""social network"" for Mazda RX-8 enthusiasts, etc.  This space is mostly filled by ""forums"" now, which don't necessarily have (or need, and this point is probably key) the same suite of features as a ""full fledged social network.""<p>But if there was a way to take advantage of all these discrete communities of interests, yet still give a user convenient access to their entire social-graph at all times, and a void ""profile fatigue"" and ""password fatigue"" then one could probably accomplish something.<p>Whether or not what Diaspora are building, or one of the other varied ""decentralized social network"" projects, remains to be seen.  And how the hell you monetize it if you could build it also remains to be seen.  But there point in all this rambling was really just to say that there are needs for ""networking"" that Facebook isn't filling at least not alone.  Now the combination of Facebook, Gallifreybase.com and rx8forum.com may fill the needs of the hypothetical Doctor Who watching, RX-8 driving, social-networker.

In other words, investment.  The problem is that an investment is only a <i>good</i> investment when it increases the productive capacity for something that people <i>actually</i> want tomorrow.  It does no good for everyone to invest in houses when they really need health care upon cashing out those claim checks.<p>And there are often technological barriers that prevent dollar investments from being productive.  You can pump all the money into biotech research that you want, but you're still not going to get a cure for cancer until someone actually <i>cures cancer</i>.  Innovation has a random element that isn't always amenable to throwing money at the problem.<p>People often wonder why the U.S. economy did so well after WW2, compared to the Depression before and the 1970s malaise afterwards.  IMHO, it was because the large amount of pure scientific research undertaken during the war created a large stockpile of fundamental scientific breakthroughs that were ready to be exploited.

In general I've found the selection pretty adequate for my needs, since I'd probably be putting it into index funds anyway, and there're only so many indexes out there.  My only quibble is that there's not all that much international diversification possible - but my 401k limit isn't anywhere near my total savings, so I can just put outside money towards that.",1279502479
1527290,story,,,5,5,wanderboy,"Ask HN: What's the best way to sell a domain name?",,"I recently decided to call it quits on a Web application that I was pretty excited about at the time: I was planning on adding restaurant menus to a database so that users could add their feedback about the menu items themselves, rather than the restaurant as a whole. Each menu item had the same price and description as the physical menu, but also showed which percentage of users liked the item.<p>The domain that I was using for this project was menuvoice.com<p>Just looking through the current offerings on GoDaddy's site, I see that MenuAssistant.com is selling for $2700, and other domains that lead off with menu are priced similarly. I'm interested in selling this domain for roughly $2000-$2500 - since both words are easily pronounced and spelled, and the domain is only nine letters long. I also own the Twitter account name for it, which I would be offering as well.<p>My question to the HN community is: what is the best way to expedite this process? Is this a domain that should theoretically be valuable? 
I don't want to have to spend years sitting on this before anyone bites, but I understand that patience here is probably important.<p>One strategy that I thought about was to contact start-ups with a similar focus, and send them e-mails explaining that I'm looking for a buyer.",1279502370

There's also an element of fantasy in this - if you've ever pitched or thought about pitching anything to a potential client, investor or business partner, you wish you could close them like Don Draper, too.

We have a lot of different technologies for text input these days, but I don't feel like any of them would be better than a keyboard for working at a desk, even if they worked perfectly.<p>-Touchscreens can eliminate the need for typing to interact with a computer, but people will always want to communicate with each other in writing. On a touchscreen only device, this means virtual keyboards.  Those are a convenient tradeoff for portable devices, but they're not ideal, and when you have space for as much screen as you need <i>and</i> a keyboard, I can't think of a good reason to get rid of physical keys.<p>-100% accurate voice recognition would be nice for some things, but I think I'd still be too slow, tiring, disruptive, or not private enough for most uses.<p>-Silent speech recognition (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_speech_interface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_speech_interface</a>) is a really interesting option, I think.

This means sometimes saying, ""I don't know how to do that, but I can learn.""<p>- Follow through. I've had one client pay me to learn something just because he knows I will do what I say I will.<p>I'm sure there's more tips, and I do a lot wrong (like not say ""No"").

1527268,comment,1526935,1526935,0,0,ahlatimer,,,"I'm 20 (almost 21), have about three years of real world experience, one in the niche I'm working in (Rails), and I started freelancing via elance a little over a month ago. I've made, so far, $2350 working 20 or so hours a week, and I've already started getting contacted for work instead of actively seeking it. I also made an extra grand through a personal contact, but those may or may not be an option for you. Freelancing isn't hard, and the barrier to entry is surprisingly low.<p>I'm honest with clients, and that may or may not have helped me succeed. I have yet to make a promise I was unable to deliver. Make sure you give yourself a little bit of breathing room. If something is probably going to take me a week, I'll tell the client it will take me a week and a half. It might be easy to promise you'll have something done by some date to please the client, but I'd rather have a few repeat clients than a ton of people I've only worked with once.<p>I'm not charging a lot ($25/hour, which I'll probably raise soon), but I'm still charging double or triple what some foreign providers are charging. I don't know where you're from, but if you're a native English speaker (bonus if you're in the US), you have an advantage already. The people I've worked with are willing to pay extra to have people in a similar timezone that natively speak English.<p>It's not all roses, though. Some people expect you to work for pennies, or they grossly underestimate what goes into building something. You just have to walk away from those clients. You'll also see a lot of people wanting x for y built, where x is some popular social network and y is some (apparently) under served market. You might have some issue building something you know is likely going to fail, but they're usually happy to pay.<p>Some people suggest becoming a master of some niche field. Doing so will apparently cause people to seek you out. That might work, but, honestly, I've found it to be unnecessary. I'm already in the top 5% of Rails providers on elance, and I'm not the most experienced Rails developer. Again, the barrier to entry is surprisingly low.<p>It also makes me feel better to go through a freelancing site. Fixed price jobs on elance, for instance, are usually escrow type where the client sends the funds into escrow and elance hangs on to them until they mark the job complete. At least, that way, you know that the client is good for it.<p>Edit: To expand on my argument that you don't need to be a master of some niche, I will suggest that you <i>target</i> a niche, even if you aren't a master at it. You'll compete a lot less being a Rails developer than a Ruby developer. It seems me to you'll also have better luck if you pick something that hasn't been commoditized by overseas companies (say, picking Ruby or Python over Java or PHP).",1279501214
