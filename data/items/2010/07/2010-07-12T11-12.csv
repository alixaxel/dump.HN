Even within the realms of human programming languages, competence may require struggling with concepts that are as difficult as, say, monads or virtual destructors or Prolog cuts or abstract factory factory factory factories or call-with-current-continuation.

Also, political crap trying to deploy linux based servers on windows/activedirectory centric networks, with multiple layers of policymakers involved in every decision.  Very very little worthwhile technology.  The only people in the overall government space doing commercially-normal interesting tech seem to be TIGR, and for mostly-awesome (but still inferior to b2c webapps, by a mile!), Palantir.<p>On top of that, the whole sealand thing from 2000-2002, and anon ecash stuff in the caribbean from 1995 (mit) through 1999 or so.<p>Then, learning more about defense contracting and how the military works, having zero background to start, from 2003 onward.<p>And the ""going to iraq thinking it would just be reconstruction and a technology land-grab, and it turns into a shooting war after the war itself is done"" thing.<p>Combine that with generic startup things with somewhat more fraud and logistics problems than you'd face in the US, and living in a mix of crappy (iraq, afghanistan) and boring (5-star hotels in dubai and kuwait).<p>If you're interested in the war part, actual soldiers have way more interesting stories from iraq or afghanistan.

I use one with leather lining, and it's an amazingly thin wallet, but which looks like a regular one. Has space for all my cards (not that many), plus some money.<p>* Cellphone (Samsung Touch, a terrible phone I'm stuck with)<p>* Keychain - An openable metal ring for easy removal of stuff, which right now include: Car keys, house keys, 8gb flash disk, and an old CPLD chip from my former job with a hole in the middle.<p>In back pockets:<p>* Coins, rarely. I almost never keep coins on me, but sometimes you get stuck with them after cash transactions (I prefer credit cards any chance I can use them).<p>* Extra keys, if I need (taking a different car than my regular one, etc.).<p>Used to have or want:<p>* Used to carry a small LED flashlight (don't remember which), but it lost its battery and hasn't been replaced (sadly).<p>* Wish I had a small pen.<p>* Have a Leatherman Squirt pocket everything, but don't usually carry it around.",1278932567
