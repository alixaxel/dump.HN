Buddhist meditation is a skill that concerns itself with two activities. I've provided a link at the end of this reply that you can use to learn Mindfulness (as taught by a monk who is also a Stanford Ph.D in Buddhist Studies).<p>So what are the activities that comprise meditation?<p>The first activity is to willfully concentrate the mind in an effort to calm it. This is done by focusing strictly on the sensation of the breath in order to restrict the mind from wandering off. The name of this activity in Pali is called ""samatha"", which means ""calm"" or ""tranquility"".<p>The second activity is to see the processes by which the mind runs off into orthogonal thought and unhelpful states of mind. Once you see these processes happening, you intervene in them to stop them from happening in order to bring your mind into a strong state of calm awareness. This activity is called ""vipassana"" in Pali. It means ""insight"" in English.<p>Samatha and vipassana are two sides of the same coin. They are a process broken into two supporting functions to achieve the goal. When people are introduced to meditation, they are being introduced to the encompassing practice of samatha-vipassana, otherwise referred to as Mindfulness Meditation.<p>One of the most thorough and accessible sources of instruction on Mindfulness is Gil Fronsdal.

They make attempts at ""post-validation"" and ""attribute scrubbing"", but these are at best makeup on a gorilla.  I certainly wouldn't call their solutions elegant.<p>Having worked on numerous content management systems in the past, one of our biggest issues was trying to ""lock down"" the WYSIWYG editor so as to minimize the chances that clients could inadvertently break the layout when editing.

1534689,comment,1534164,1534282,0,0,ahoyhere,,,"I grew up poor: went to school with holes in my clothes, had the electricity turned off, etc. (But because my poor-ness was due to my mother's infelicity with money, not because we didn't have any at all, we also had some finer things like a computer.)<p>I can tell you that money can't buy you happiness. Money doesn't even buy a sense of security. Your attitudes about money can make or break your happiness.<p>Example: If you are in the Sustenance Driven mindset defined by Abraham Maslow, you will always be motivated by ""getting enough"" and ""keeping it"" - even if you have a comfortable middle class lifestyle, you will be kept awake at night, afraid you will lose it. While most descriptions you find online will equate the <i>feeling</i> of Sustenance with actual Sustenance, you can hold this mindset no matter how much you have.<p>My (divorced) parents, no matter their earnings, were always in that category.<p>I was, too, until I actually did lose it all - I got scammed out of 2 months of work, had my car stolen, got mono, couldn't work for months, lost all my other clients, came within a hairs' breadth of being sued by one of them... if not for some guy I was only casually friends with on IRC, who up and gave me my rent one month, I would have been evicted and homeless.<p>Then I realized: it sucked, but I didn't die, and I recovered, got a job, bought a car, paid off that angry client, paid off my credit card debt.<p>Now I know exactly what money is worth to me.<p>That's why I quit a job where I could have stayed forever, never been fired, and got profit sharing that increased every month - by the time I quit, it was already equal to an additional pay check a month, and I was earning over $150,000 a year. Because I was unhappy there and knew what money was worth to me, and it wasn't worth that unhappiness.<p>So, there you go. Money can't buy you happiness. It can't even buy you the feeling of security, it can't even make you free from worry, because you can have lots of money and still feel insecure and worry about losing it all. It is, literally, all in your head.",1279701881

1534675,comment,1531004,1531658,0,0,akeefer,,,"Sigh . . .<p>I get that CPS doesn't always do the best job, and plenty of the people that work there are on a power trip and got into social work because they like telling other people what to do.  The world would certainly be a better place if they were able to do their job better and if some of their officers were more courteous.<p>But as you probably know, working for CPS is an <i>incredibly</i> difficult job.  It's very demanding on your time, it's immensely stressful emotionally, <i>everyone</i> hates you, and it can put you in physical danger (you often have to be accompanied by a police officer).  Unsurprisingly, in many places they have trouble finding enough qualified applications to fill the necessary positions. I know that I sure as hell wouldn't want to do that job.<p>I guess I just get tired of the vitriol directed their direction as if the world would be a better place if CPS wasn't around, or as if they intentionally make life hard on people just because, or as if they're somehow more lenient on poor people.  Your additional comment there is, in my experience, pretty wildly off-base:  my wife is a social worker who works with plenty of poor clients who have had children taken away and never managed to get them back because they're unable to support them financially or have ongoing drug or alcohol problems.  The kids are put in group or foster homes basically permanently, not sent back to their parents.  And it's not like the ""poor crackheads,"" as you so respectfully put it, don't care:  they care just as much as anyone else does.<p>What I'd like to see is some more level-headed analysis of what the ""false positive"" or ""false negative"" rates are.  For every family innocently harrassed, how many families are quickly cleared of any wrongdoing and how many children are removed from abusive situations?  It makes a big difference if 60% of the claims CPS investigates result in putting an innocent family through hell or if 1% of the investigations do.<p>Again . . . would the world be better if CPS was able to do a better job? Sure.  Would the world be a better place if we reverted back to treating children like property with no rights and allowing parents complete free rein over their children?  No.",1279701020
