The first time, ""x"" is a thunk.  That thunk is evaluated, and the runtime stores the resulting value back into ""x"".  The second time, ""x"" is a constructor, so it does not need to be evaluated.  You'll see the memory usage spike after the first ""print"" to account for the million cons cells allocated.<p>This is no different than the interface provided by the memoization function.  What distinguishes pure from impure is not memory access -- memory MUST always be modified in order to perform calculation.  I recommend reading the Haskell report section on semantics.",1279713528

European death-penalty abolitionists quickly realized the futility of trying to change public opinion on a mass scale, and instead devised strategies to accomplish abolition despite lingering public support for the death penalty. Pointing to the importance of political structures that allowed European abolitionists to bypass public opinion, this study assesses the prospects of the 'European model' of abolition in global perspective.</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0230231985?tag=gerjoy-21&camp=1406&creative=6394&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0230231985&adid=1DRWYT2134GART9GRQ6G&#38"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0230231985?tag=gerjoy-21&camp...</a>;",1279711918

This is meant to work around Google's duplicate content detection algorithm).  It isn't hard for a person to notice the similarities between the documents, but it is subtle enough (or computationally difficult enough) that search engines seem to be fooled.<p>I think that one of my competitors has taken some article content from my site, ""spun"" it (possibly by hand) and reposted it on one of those post-your-content-with-backlinks sites you sometimes find in search results.  (Except they posted it with backlinks to their site, of course.)<p>If this was a direct, verbatim copy I'd contact the hosting site to notify them of the copyright violation.<p>But that's not what this is, it's more like a section by section, sentence by sentence paraphrasing of my content, with some other slight modifications (which is why I think it may have been done by hand, but I'm not familiar enough with spinning to know what's normal and what's not).  I'm pretty sure that my content was the source document for this, since there are some unusual phrases that carried over to the new document, and the structure of many of the sections, paragraphs and sentences of the new document are identical to some on my site.<p>Both the site on which this content was posted and the site to which it is linking are legitimate business that I assume would respond to something like a DMCA take-down notice.<p>I'm well aware of the degree, nature and much of the mechanics of plagiarism on the web, and while I'm annoyed (possibly flattered) that it seems a competitor more or less plagiarized content from my site, but my bigger concern is this is the tip of the iceberg and I'm about to see dozens of close copies of my content floating around the web.<p>Is there anything I can or should do about this?",1279711712

He had lots of money yet the money didn't have him.<p>Ron Howard was one of the most famous child actors from the 60s. Did his parents get him his own sitcom, tutors, and trips overseas? Nope. The Howards lived in a suburb in a modest home. Ron was expected to go to regular school like everyone else. Shooting on the Andy Griffith show was adjusted to make sure that the kid had a normal life. Sometimes his dad found work on the set doing odds and ends. All of his money was put in the bank until he got out of college.",1279710467
