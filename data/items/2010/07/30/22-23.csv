Let's just ban alcohol because there will always be people that can't handle it.<p>Instead, why don't we look at the problem. The largest problem is that it's forbidden, so the majority of kids growing up have to sneak around and drink with other kids that are irresponsible. Telling a kid he can't do something just makes him want to do it even more.<p>If we introduce kids to responsible drinking at an earlier age, it wouldn't be so intriguing and they could learn a little bit about responsibility. You'd still have problems but I bet they'd be fewer and we could get back a little more freedom.",1280530634

1562849,comment,1559075,1559335,0,0,biturd,,,"Maybe that ""clarity of purpose"" is just age old stubbornness.  Going at something so long, so hard, so staunch, and then learning over time perhaps you need to adapt and change.  However, you have dug yourself into a deep hole, due to the rigidness over time, you would never be able to adapt, as people would see it as weak, and your own self/ego would not allow it.<p>The guy is in a tough spot.<p>I wish someone would have asked him about the eating of his toe jam. :)  It was touched on, and I understand it is not important, but his appearance distracts from his goal.  And who in the hell eats the crap between your toes? ( I mean, in public that is, I do so in the privacy of my safe room, duh! )<p>How in the heck could he have forgotten the belittling of a small kid.  Either the OP was in fact making it up/embellishing, or there is no way he forgot, and was covering.<p>The hypothetical about the software based medical solution; that was a surprising answer to me.  In a way, he has invented a religious dogma.  He seems to have an answer to everything that comes up, in the same way religions also have an answer for dinosaurs and aliens.<p>Just pick a damn movie and pick a damn book for Christ's sake! :)<p>This one just killed me:<p><pre><code>     When a company says, ""We want to merge with competitor XYZ,\n     since we are too small to compete in this market, and by the way\n     the merged company will become the biggest in the field,"" we\n     need to respond, ""We won't let you merge. However, we just split\n     your biggest competitor into 5 pieces; maybe now you will find\n     it easier to compete.""\n</code></pre>\nThat is insanity.  The guy is not working towards freedom in any sense of the word when I read statements such as that.  Government enforced split companies to help out the little guy; sorry, I can't get behind that one at all, no matter how skewed our system is in favor of the big guy.<p>His inability to adapt his position hurts him in the long run.  When making comments about textbooks, it was clear to me, that the preferable solution would be to use a free textbook over a non free textbook.  I can get behind that.  However, when the quality of the non free textbook is abysmal, you must  go with the non free version.  We are talking about one's eduction, or health, or life saving scenario, their future in general.<p>Giving up a little in the beginning to position yourself to be able to make sure that what you gave up in the beginning never happens again, is the adaptation he lacks, which hurts his end game.<p>Compromise does not seem to be in his vocabulary, yet I suspect he would be so much further along had he learned about it.  He may walk into a meeting with major leaders of other countries to get them to look into free software deployment on a scale of millions.  That sets the tone to be able to one day implement his idealistic end game.  That meeting would have no negotiation to it, it would be his way, or no way, in which case, Microsoft just made all the money, and he took a step backwards for the sake of being stubborn.",1280530111

1562839,comment,1561913,1562521,0,0,protomyth,,,"Sony had a better chance than Microsoft being in that space longer and also being a content producer.  If Sony had come up with an iTunes service at the same time as Apple and incorporated it into the Walkman, Sony TVs, Sony / Erickson cellphones, and the PS/2 then Apple would have had some real competition.  But, it didn't happen much like Barnes & Noble didn't build a competitor to Amazon until it was too late.<p>Microsoft's biggest problem is that the Windows franchise was not directly translatable into MP3 players or phones.  This made their normal ""me-too"" strategy very hard.  Also, all of the lock-in that Microsoft got from their Windows line was actually in Apple's favor with the iTunes ecosystem.  ""Me too"" doesn't work if the switching cost is too high.<p>Microsoft Home Server is great for geeks and knowledgable users, but it is too expensive (PC cost / maintenance cost) for normal people.  I believe Courier would have been a great product, but it, by design, would not have had the depth of ecosystem that the iPad has.  It would have been an amazing device for business though.",1280529779

When you're Google you can <i>afford</i> to write this in C++ or Java (with layers of libraries taking the boiler plate out) as well waste research/prototype time on compile/link cycle (rather being able to program interactively). When you're Google, you can also afford to only hire machine learning people who know how to write production quality C++ (very rare combination of skills). Clojure is a more acceptable language: despite of what fanboys say, FP is not a black art reserved for 99.9th percentile programmers; the more C++ I write, the more convinced I get that C++ <i>is</i>.<p>b) Clojure interop with Java makes it easy to use this sort of system with Hadoop, Mahout, Colt, etc... Sure there are more effective libraries available in C++, but they either proprietary to Google (MapReduce + GFS), not designed for fault tolerance (MPI) or more time consuming to use (LINPACK, LAPACK)<p>c) Python is going to be 10-20 times slower, (perhaps 5x when you're using C interop).",1280529722

I've just seen the thread on this.<p>There are various possible ""modes"" in QRSS and certainly plain on/off keying as you suggest, which is in fact just very slow morse code, is one of them.<p>The mode I am transmitting here can be known as FSK/CW. CW (Morse Code) in a Frequency Shift Keyed (FSK) way. As you say, the top level is the ""key down"" ordinary morse code.<p>The reason for this is NOT just an artefact of the circuit design! The circuit is designed this way for a reason! I could just have easily designed it such that it keyed the signal on and off, like real morse code but much slower.<p>There are several reasons why FSK/CW is more suitable than plain on/off keying. 1) and 2) below are the most important.<p>1) Readability: Many kinds of interfering signals on the band are just a plain carrier. It might be some mixing product coming out of your computer monitor, or a harmonic signal of some oscillator in your neighbour's TV, or plain carrier transmissions from great distances. A weak carrier, drifting in and out of visibility, can look VERY much like a weak on/off keyed CW signal in QRSS. Experience of QRSS experimenters has shown that it is much easier to read the ""squarewave"" FSK/CW style transmission. It appears to be more resilient to interference and weak signal propagation conditions.<p>2) Chirp. This is a temporary shift in frequency which occurs on key down, in an on/off keyed CW transmitter. That makes the end result much harder to read, less resilient to interference, and just plain ugly. See some examples at <a href=""http://www.hanssummers.com/qrss/qrssqrv.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanssummers.com/qrss/qrssqrv.html</a> . This ""chirp"" can be very hard to get rid of in such simple circuits. It may only be a few Hz of frequency shift but it is very ugly and visible on QRSS transmissions. Having the transmission continuously ON and just shifting its frequency slightly, avoids the chirp problem.<p>3) Drift: as the oscillator components and crystal heat up, the frequency can drift a few 10's of Hz. On key down, components will be transmitting some hundred or so milliwatts of power and can slightly warm up, changing the frequency ever so slightly but visibly. Again, a problem that is not so easy to resolve in such a simple circuit. Keeping the transmission permanently ON solves that problem too as once the steady state thermal equilibrium is reached, everything stays there.<p>I hope this helps to explain it - you can read more about my QRSS experiments at my web page <a href=""http://www.hanssummers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanssummers.com</a> and let me know if you have any more questions<p>Hans\n<a href=""http://www.hanssummers.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hanssummers.com</a>",1280527601
