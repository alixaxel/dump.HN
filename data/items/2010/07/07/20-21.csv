Unfortunately, you will occasionally run into people who either ""don't have time"" to review materials before a meeting, or who deliberately hold something back to use against you in the meeting (you'll also run into people who say they've reviewed stuff in advance, but then suddenly ""realize"" something in the meeting). Establishing the ground rules in advance (so that everyone knows that stakeholders had time to review the materials) can help - sometimes people are reluctant to admit that they didn't review in advance. Unfortunately, there's no sure way to avoid a surprise, and sometimes people legitimately identify a concern during the meeting. When that happens, the key thing is to make sure that there is a clear action plan for dealing with the issue. You want to make sure that people walk out of the room knowing how the issue/question is being resolved, and what the deadline is. If not, you will probably find that you have to have the meeting all over again.",1278536211

High APM is important for two reasons:\na) Scouting constantly, producing units, upgrades, building buildings, attacking, harassing, retreating, maneuvering. With multiple units/control groups. There is a ton of stuff to be done.\nb) Optimizing the workqueue, ie. is highly correlated to how good your multitasking is. For instance, leading two units to scout in 1 sec is not good enough if you send them to the same path because your accuracy is bad. Sending them to two different meaningful locations, with a plan for each of them, is. However, correlation does not imply causation.<p>It should be noted that high APM does not make you good, but your APM will go up while you're getting better. Think of it as obtaining a natural aptitude with the game's mechanics.

I have put considerable thought into corporal punishment.  And in my case the thought is both theoretical and practical.<p>While I grant that there are lots of people who are against corporal punishment as a matter of political correctness, there are also very good reasons not to use corporal punishment that have absolutely nothing to do with political correctness.<p>The first, and simplest, is that children model their behavior on ours.  If you hit your kid, your kid will try hitting other kids.  And, according to statistics, they are also more likely to hit other people in their lives, including spouses and their own kids.  If you don't want to encourage that behavior, you need to not model it.<p>The second is that children who experience corporal punishment become more focused on avoiding the punishment than on internalizing the lesson they were supposed to learn.  The classic example is the kid running out on a street looking around to be sure that mom isn't watching, and <i>not</i> looking for the car that is coming.  Other forms of discipline have much less of this problem.<p>Corporal punishment also toughens the child's response to punishment.  This makes them much less likely to respect alternate forms of punishment.  Which makes them less likely to respect attempts at discipline in other child care settings, such as detentions at school.<p>Now you can try to solve problem 3 by supplementing others' punishment with your own corporal punishment.  But only at the cost of worsening problems 1 and 2.<p>All of this wouldn't matter much if it weren't for the fact that other forms of discipline have been observed to be just as effective in altering children's behavior, <i>and</i> do not have the same drawbacks.  Luckily those forms of discipline (and in many cases alternatives to discipline!) exist.  And therefore there is no good reason to use corporal punishment.",1278535076

Everything else comes naturally.<p>I disagree.<p>I agree with your encouraging sentiment but I don't agree that simply loving your child is enough - parenting doesn't come naturally to those who haven't grown up around it. Most people nowadays appear to only have their parents model of parenting to rely on and this appears to lead them to polarise away from how their parents treated them.<p>Watched Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with my lad J the other day wherein the girl Veruca Salt is spoiled by her parents who simply love her and so give her everything she asks for.<p>I'm not going to say that you need a degree in Ed-Psych or anything either ...<p>When you say ""it's rather easy"" that sends up a few flags for me. Perhaps you can answer this one for me: my (now nearly 5yo) boy has enjoyed learning chess with me and on the whole can move the pieces around and make some trade-off decisions under close instruction, he messed up the board at our last game (after a long chess <i>haitus</i>) because he was losing and then starting flinging stuff around; in short he was upset not to win and said he wouldn't play again. Should I encourage him to play or forget the game (that I know he enjoys and has been nice to play together). If I get him to play should I let him win?<p>My youngest is now 15mo and is getting fussy about his breakfast food, should I give in and give him what he'll eat at the risk of limiting his palette and enjoyment of a variety of foods or should I force feed him (and starve him if he won't eat it)?<p>OT now, long post, sorry.<p>TL;DR I don't think it's easy nor that it all comes naturally.",1278533130

I won't get into specifics, but it's made me thousands of dollars. Apple handles the central distribution, the payment processing, application updates, crash reports, ALL of that, and puts money into my checking account at the end of each month. What more can I possibly ask for?<p>I have friends that are making serious money from the App Store, tens of thousands per month by themselves or split with a designer/developer friend they're working with. None of them are leaving, none of them are complaining, none of them are turning their native Obj-C apps into web apps.<p>For everyone out there who hates the App Store because of bad publicity and articles like this, please remember that there are tons of ordinary developers out there making good money doing stuff they love. The App Store and the approval process has a TON of flaws, but all I know is it's the #1 distribution center for apps to mobile devices and it's just getting bigger. Right now there's no better way to quickly build an app and start getting paid. Ranting about everyone moving to web apps doesn't do much to change this fact.",1278532881

I setup a variety of interpolation algorithms, which are fun to play with.  If someone needs access to it and has a cool project, we are happy to provide it.  Get ahold of me via email for info.<p>The SRTM data is < 20 gigs compressed, and I downloaded it from some source, can't find the link now.  It was a SLOWWWWWW download, so took many days.  Reminded me of my old 2400 baud modem.<p>the NED dataset is just shy of 500 gigs.  We shipped a drive off to the USGS and they populated it and shipped it back.  The 2 month wait sucked, but it was the only way to get it without paying a thousand bucks from a private company.<p>I am happy to share either the SRTM or the NED dataset we have, but sharing it is pretty much limited to shipping hard drives around :(",1278532823
