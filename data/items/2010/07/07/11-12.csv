1493925,comment,1493237,1493237,0,0,Mc_Big_G,,,"As someone else has said previously, it was the entire site. <a href=""http://flooha.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flooha.com</a>.<p>I thought customizing FOSS with addons was a huge pain point since many require merging code, making database changes, uploading files etc...  What people really want is Weebly & Co.<p>I spent a lot of time on things like premature optimization.  Here are some examples:<p>1) The system can build/install 325 software packages per minute.<p>I designed the system to dynamically create and destroy EC2 instances as demand rises and falls.  It was very cool to work on, but a total waste of time.<p>2) An over-complicated system to detect code conflicts between addons and the core software.<p>This was also fun, but again, a total waste of time.  The system will try a large number of permutations before giving up on trying to merge the code.  When you have many addons that modify the same block of code, it can be frustrating for a non-programmer to try to do this.  In hindsight, I should have just used git, but git was very new to me and I didn't see how to leverage it at the time.  So jealous of the github guys to latch on to it so early.<p>3) 1-click backups and restores.<p>All the user had to do is click the ""backup"" or ""restore"" link and the code and database would be automatically updated.<p>4) Built an extensive wiki for the site without having a single customer.<p>5) Built an upload system where all the user had to do was upload a zip which included only the files with code changes and a sql file with db changes.  No one but me ever uploaded an addon.<p>6) Prematurely built a simple app upload system simimlar to the addon upload system with code/sql files in a zip, but you could also specify ""post install commands"" to change file permissions or delete unnecessary directories, etc... Also, you could upload config files and create ""config variables"" which would be specified by the user in a form and inserted into the config files dynamically at build time.<p>I was the only one that ever uploaded an app, but I thought developers might want to do it in the future.  In hindsight, it would have been better to use git or something similar.<p>7) Included app and addon reviews, user avatars and other unnecessary fluff.<p>8) Included the ability to upload screencasts, which went directly to youtube, showing how to use an addon.<p>9) An extensive versioning system for apps, so anyone could upload their own version (fork).  Again, git would have been the way to go.<p>10) I wrote several tools to bulk download Wordpress/Drupal/etc addons and then parse them for their description, authors, links, instructions, version etc... which were then uploaded to the system.<p>As I've said, I probably should have just integrated everything with git, but I was going after power users who aren't comfortable with those kinds of tools.  I over estimated the market for this kind of customization.<p>The real failure of it all was that I didn't do customer development and verify that there was actually a market for this kind of website.  I thought about just turning it into another ""website installer"" like Fantastico, but it didn't seem like it was worth the effort.  I haven't been keeping up with new app/addon versions so things are a bit stale there now.<p>I've become extremely pragmatic about features and optimization since then.  I'll fight to the death to keep out features now.",1278503778

1493900,comment,1493649,1493649,0,0,yardie,,,"I've been living in Paris for a few years and bought an apartment last year. If you are the right type of person, finding an apartment is less difficult. By the right person I mean skin tone, profession, or passport. The mayors of Paris and NYC have the same problem but slightly different ideas on tackling it.<p>Bloomberg, a capitalist, believes that Manhattan should be a playground for the rich. The tax receipts can be put to good use to help the less fortunate by keeping them far outside the city. Delanoë is a socialist, he has the power to take a building if it is left vacant for a long period of time (10-20 years) and convert it to city housing. I've seen parking garages, disgarded mansions, and old banks converted to living quarters. There are many places like these all around the Paris and the paperwork is glacial.<p>The apartment owners have to be found. And for a city as old as this one this is a real task. Children grow up, move away, inherit property and neglect it for decades. All of them have to be tracked down and given the ultimatum of fixing it, selling it, or donating it to the state. That last one happens when no heirs exist. The gov't owns tons off these.<p>Practically, every week there is a protest going on to let the city know there is an affordable housing shortage. Like I said there are places to rent but the owners put on onerous terms to only get the best renters. A waiter wouldn't be able to easily find a place in the city, but if he has rich parents to cosign then it gets easier. Once, you sign a lease you are locked in. The owners can't force you out and eviction takes years.<p>To avoid this lots of owners were doing only short term leases to tourists, students and companies. Good for the owners, but extremely bad for normal renters who've had to endure one price increase after another.<p>I believe it's a bad idea to tell owners how to manage their properties. According to one of my real estate friends, there is plenty of places in Paris to live. The government should try looking under it's bed. It's cheaper, and easier for them to write laws telling people what to do verses redeveloping the properties sitting in their lap.",1278502153
