The summer smog warnings are nothing to be proud of.<p>GTA (Greater Toronto Area) drivers are among the rudest drivers I've ever seen (red light means GO!). Unless you live in the downtown core, you basically need a car. And the major arteries in and out of the city are hardly world class.<p>The transit system, which everyone brags about, sucks. Compared to Montreal, which has an excellent subway system, geographic coverage is lacking. If you live at one of the corners, you're on a bus for an hour before you get to a subway station.<p>While crime isn't nearly as bad as the worst US cities, gun crime is much more prevalent than it was when I was young.<p>The tech industry is doing fairly well here, but Toronto isn't the shiny gem it used to be.",1280455059

At the very least, we know that it's happening.</i><p>I just think it's weird to raise the ""possible accidental usage of a possibly racist term flag"" for a word that very few, if any, people have ever heard used in that context.<p>It has been educational though. I've never heard that word used in that context -- ever. Now I'll be on the lookout for it because it would have simply passed me by.<p>FYI, during this exchange I was curious that I could have missed hearing such a usage for the term, I actually just went to google to see if I could find an actual real world example of it being used in such a context (outside of Urban Dictionary) and instead found several hundred uses of it most specifically not being used in the racial context. As newspaper headlines, names of companies, titles of works of literature, online handles, pieces of software, programming frameworks, etc. e.g.<p><pre><code>  http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/27/yes-niggling/

etc. etc. etc.<p>In fact, other than a couple different urban dictionaries and a letter relating a warning by a professor not to use the term because it might get confused with the n-bomb, I actually <i>couldn't</i> find an actual usage of the term that was derogatory -- and I went at least 20 pages in on the search results. If you can find a real, honest to gosh usage, please link it here because I have yet to see one.<p>""niggardly"" on the other hand, I wouldn't use just because it's archaic and sounds silly but also because it's etymology is the same as the n-bomb.",1280454634

There certainly aren't several hundred ""largest"" tech firms by definition (or you'd dilute the definition of ""largest"").<p>For example, I don't know a single Google engineer who is for patents, and the official Google line calls for ""reform"" of the system. Meanwhile, Microsoft's position is mum, and the #4 search on ""microsoft position patents"" is a 37signals article on how they trolled Salesforce.<p>It would be interesting if someone did a quantitative analysis of the big firms, say, the top 20.

It's racist!"".<p>But it gets a bit silly when a random group of people, a very small socially marginalized one, can co-opt any random word for a stupid reason and then we all have to tip-toe around it because we might accidentally offend somebody who wears their ""offend me"" button on the outside.<p>Check out <a href=""http://www.reference.com/browse/List_of_ethnic_slurs_by_ethnicity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reference.com/browse/List_of_ethnic_slurs_by_ethn...</a>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_racial_slurs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_racial_slurs</a><p>It's amazing the length of the list of words that have been historically used as ethnic slurs. If I had to keep a mental rolodex of these words around, I'd probably never be able to talk about pretty much anything. According to the list above, even some cherished dances from part of my cultural heritage are now considered racial epithets as is the first name of President Lincoln!<p>The reason newspapers and the like try and avoid these words has nothing to do with their usage by racist assholes. If that were the case, all you had to do force newspapers into all kinds of pretzels would be to just start using random verbiage as slurs. The reason they avoid those words is that people get offended by being called those random things. Offended readers can be vocal readers and vocal readers can cause trouble.<p>If ""salad"" suddenly started being used as a racial epithet for African-Americans tomorrow by the KKK, would newspapers the world over have to stop using it?
