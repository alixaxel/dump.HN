With the right co-founder I am confident I can raise money quickly on the ideas I have.  I nearly raised money before the crash, and now that capitol is flowing again I think the time is right.<p>I have worked at Manpower as a consultant to the VP of Global Solutions developing their social media strategy.  I worked at Hi5 and MySpace working on OpenSocial and OpenID, and just left a growing company like Unity, because I believe that Social Media is just tipping the iceburg and i was not going to be able to purse it there.  You should be very passionate about social media.<p>I am a charismatic guy and love building stuff.  I have worked at every layer of the software and systems stack from hardware to front-end design.  I am weakest at the systems infrastructure level, so, I know what a shell script is and can read and hack at one, but I would not claim to be an expert at writing them.  The perfect co-founder loves linux, and knows how to build back-end infrastructure.  They should know mysql, but have been experimenting with Cassandra, MongoDB or something similar in the NoSQL/ Graph space.<p>So, if you are interested in grabbing coffee ASAP my email is jdavid.net@gmail.com",1278125855

You can read more about what I've written about this idea here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1263984"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1263984</a><p>The key thing is that if a site's points/badges are left in their own island then they have a fraction of the value than if they were part of a universal system (e.g. Xbox Live's GamerScore). You may claim that this will come in time, but the problem with that is your offering is less than half as compelling without a universal system and such initial traction will be hampered. Furthermore, if you don't plan for a universal system initially you won't have the necessary policies and normalizations in place to make for a 'fair' system.<p>Alongside that if you have everything done through an api it's a bit too onerous for developers. An entire system may take 2 months to code, and you're taking off maybe one month. The goal should take integration down to a couple of days (javascript libraries are quite useful for this).<p>Either way, best of luck! Someone is going to take this concept and run away with it and become rich. You're just as likely as the other entrants so congrats on launching!",1278125625

Even in a court room at times today that seemed to be the case. Mark and Marian provided seed money for Hashrocket and founded the company with Obie. They also own a separate company called United Directories that provides a paper and online business listing service. The companies are completely separate entities. None of this has anything to do with or any impact on Hashrocket. Hashrocket is a stand alone, profitable consultancy. That being said, I have always known Marian and Mark to do everything they engage in with the utmost integrity.<p>Hashrocket and United Directories are in the same office building. I was in the conference room next to the United Directories space when the police came to serve their warrants to United Directories. The police officers proceeded to tell the United Directories employees, ""You no longer have a job. This company does not exist anymore. You will not be receiving a paycheck."" Again, what happened to innocent until proven guilty?<p>Then came the bail hearing today. It lasted 5 hours. I was shocked and disheartened at how few actual facts were presented by the prosecution in order for them to drag someone into court. I was further disturbed when there was almost no basis provided or facts provided to how they were making the jump from what information they did have to trying to accuse Mark, Marian and their employee Chris of the allegations against them. The prosecution then further showed a total lack of ability to understand a basic business banking account or simple math. The judge made the decision at the end of the day to release Mark, Marian and Chris on bond but the prosecution forced his hand with a legal technicality to delay the decision.<p>At the end of a very long and tiring day I have no reason to doubt my friends' character. I am saddened at what I saw transpire in our law enforcement and legal system over this past week. Hashrocket is self-sufficient and will continue to build awesome web applications for our clients. We would appreciate everyone's support in promoting facts over rumors.<p>Thank You,<p>Adam Lowe",1278122907

The correct analogy is the fact that you can use Google to find numbers that look like credit card numbers. Similarly, hosting a copyrighted file is illegal.

To prosecute me for walking down the street with any of these objects (including actual lock picks) is just ludicrous.

And in any case, the took maker is usually never liable.<p>It's a very simple idea. Prosecute the criminals, not the people who provide tools which might be used in a crime. Obviously there's an upper limit. For example, a grenade is a pretty unambiguous, single-use tool. That's why selling one is illegal. But most tools have many uses, some illegal and some not.
