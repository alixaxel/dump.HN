And this is one case where there is absolutely no need to brand the sites using the Stack Overflow name - doing so would be like branding it the same way as the supermarket own brand of a top class store. i.e. the store is quality, the goods are quality, but the brand name makes it look cheap :)",1279011527

You just serialize your objects to JSON or something else (probably already being done if you target the web). It's simple.<p>Back to ORMs, you can't avoid SQL wrappers at least to help w/ injections, and you probably want a layer that serializes/deserializes your objects as well. Once you've written that a few times it's boring so you abstract it. ORMs are pretty much inevitable when writing the common web app.<p>ORMs should borrow good things from SQL, like LINQ. Mainstream languages are better now than when SQL was created. I mean, it's not the exact syntax you like right? I prefer writing code rather than preparing and parsing strings. Plus if you ever decide to swap out the backend it's far easier when things are loosely coupled.<p>SQL is akin to JS in the browser in that you need a library to abstract away the implementation differences or you'll be tightly coupled to a specific one.

Each frame is shown twice, once to the left eye and once to the right. These are interleaved in time and synchronized with the shutters on the glasses that alternately close the left and right eye. To display stereo images, you not only need a 120hz display device, you also need a way to synchronize the glasses with the image. There are some methods that patch into the video stream and use the vsync there, there are some that plug into the television itself and are triggered by actual frame changes.

It's very useful to read books, presentations and war stories, but for me, reading code in applications designed for scale was far more important. I strongly recommend the Amazon Dynamo paper. Read and think about the design decisions they made. Then go read the Cassandra code for the actual implementation (pretty much, in terms of the big ideas, at least as it was back in 2008).<p>As with any learning it's very hard to truly grok the importance of loose coupling, service oriented architecture, embedding statelessness in the architecture etc., unless you try to build something, get it wrong and then fix it.

The rules of your business, the URL mapping of your framework, the GUI layout of your application, the steps of your tests, ... In fact, they often are (in WPF, XAML is used as a GUI definition DSL; Ant is a domain-specific language for building applications, so is Make).<p>The great advantages of the likes of Ruby, however, is that you can build DSLs in the language itself (you don't have to build your own compiler and translator from DSL to language), which rids you of most of the complexity and limitations of usual DSLs, and lets power users realize that there is a full-blown general-purpose language under the DSL (and use that power when they need it).",1279008374
