Minnesota is a pretty great place to work in tech as an employee, but it's not currently the thriving area of tech innovation I'd love to see it become.

It has been a good career from an outside perspective - great names, high salaries, chance to live abroad, responsibility beyond my years etc.<p>All is not well on the inside though.  I'm experiencing a bit of a career low and crisis of confidence, which is why I turn to the smart people at HN!<p>I'll give a brief history for context -<p>My first few years as a developer were great.  I learnt a ton about software and all things tech.  Combined with a bit of business awareness I shot up the ranks and ended up in 'senior' developer roles (in practice if not in title).  I worked on some fairly low level high performance stuff and off of this built a bit of a name for myself in some niche technical communities.  I was proud of what I achieved and felt I was learning every day and delivering good stuff.<p>The last few years though, this has really stopped.  I first had a bad year in one of my roles where issues outside of my control left me fighting fires for a year rather than coding.  I left and then spent six months in a contract role that just involved hacking HTML and Javascript together at short notice for demos.  I've now moved back into a permie role, but seem to be really struggling to get to grips with the code-base.  The bits of code I have contributed have in retrospect turned out to be buggy or poorly designed in the context of the code base.  I'm not covering myself in glory there at all.  I don't have a single achievement yet after 6 months on the job.<p>I'm fortunate in that my CV and interview technique is getting me into very well paid development roles, but every day I am feeling like more like someone who can talk a good game and live off past accomplishments, but not deliver.  It's really eating me up as I want to excel in my job and earn the respect of my team.<p>I guess I feel like I've gone backwards over the last few years.  A few reasons for this:-<p>- I never just sit there and crank out code anymore - I must have read 1000 lines of code for each one I've written over the last 2 or 3 years.<p>- I never get the opportunity to properly engineer something and learn from what works well and what doesn't work well as a result of my own design decisions.  My last few jobs have been weighted towards maintenance.<p>- I struggle a lot more with low level algorithms and data structures nowadays.  I used to be pretty good at this but have lost the edge as I've drifted up to middle tier business and CRUD coding.<p>- I have lost the art of elegant code - everything I write seems forced and fragile, too much repetition, too inflexible.  I look at other peoples code and algorithms and it just looks unattainable to me even though I was doing that 2 years ago.<p>- I've developed a few concentration issues - I drift off and surf the interwebs more than I used to.<p>- The learning has stopped - I learn new tools and languages but rarely take away a new idea from them which makes me better in the day job.<p>After this essay, I guess the question is, how do I get my mojo back and get that level of technical excellence back?<p>And did this happen to any of you guys part way into your careers, or did you have a pretty linear improvement over the years?<p>Any help appreciated!",1279133319

The trick is getting past that.<p>I kind of agree with your comment on resumes, but I'd twist it... If a resume doesn't tell me the mindset and motivation of the person, it's a 'No'. In specific, I tend to look for two things on a resume for someone early in their career:<p>1. Passion & Personality, _somewhere_. The last great resume I got had the following objective: ""I want to work with smart people on a great team making awesome software."" Perfect. Any resume that uses the words great, awesome, love, or even hate gets my attention. I need someone who cares.<p>2. Demonstrated interest. It's unbelievable how many people will tell me they love writing software, but they've never written any that wasn't for an assignment or a work project. Especially when it comes to young people, they better have written something. I don't care what it was, or how well it went.. I want to see that they're interested enough to have materialized passion and enthusiasm as a project. If you're not hiring in the software field, I'm sure there are other facets.. evidence of attempts at entrepreneurship, demonstrated leadership in community activities, etc.<p>Suuuper fast litmus tests that can be done at the resume, or 10-minute-phone-screen level.. and they'll weed out a depressingly large number of candidates.<p>Beyond that, I'd suggest that interview processes vary wildly and it's possible (no offense) that yours is highly artificial.. doesn't mean they all are. Change your process. Specifically, find ways to get candidates to demonstrate Doing The Job in their interview. It's hard, but it sounds like it's your full time job, so sweet! You ought to have the time :)<p>For the record, the resume I mentioned was someone that we hope to hire.. and we found him via one of the HN: Who's Hiring threads - <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1438505"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1438505</a><p>Cheers.",1279132705

In much the same way you can pay for key words on google, i'd love to pay for a topic.  For example, I've been working on a side project which gives you recipe ideas for ingredients you have.  I built the technology in a very modular way, which would make the construction of a plugin pretty easy. I would like to purchase the idea of ingredients so say for example someone does a search for ""celery carrots peas"" the zero click box would show my results.<p>In addition, I've noticed many people use Google for anything they want.  My mom found her email by googling for ""email"" if the search terms ever change... she wouldn't know how to get to it.  I would love to have it so if my mom already has an account on my site (which has a record of her kitchens inventory) she could search for ""recipes"" and in the zero click box would be a listing, but customized just for her.",1279131120

1515402,comment,1511104,1511104,0,0,MTC,,,"Some points-<p>1.  I laughed when the gentleman said that $3mm would be enough money for him.  Anyone who says $3mm is enough will realize that whatever number they say is ""enough"" is not enough once they reach it.<p>2.  Money doesn't make you happy.  But if you're already happy and you have money, it can make you happier.<p>3.  Money makes people pay more attention to you- especially people who didn't pay attention to you before.  People will say, ""well Barack Obama would never have shown up to your wedding before you sold your company for $1bb"".  Well no sh!t.  Why would he?  Charities will call you.  ""Well the University never paid attention to you back when you were poor"".  Universities and Charities are in the business of raising money from individuals..  Why would they?  This will be tough for people without money to understand.<p>4.  Those who have sold their companies find that money is sometimes harder to hold onto than it was to make in the first place.  If you don't have enough money (to never work again), become complacent due to your original ability to make money (particularly those in tech world), you could find yourself broke.<p>5.  Speaking of broke.  Minimize your borrowing.  The majority of very rich people who suddenly file for bankruptcy are over-leveraged and/or not diversified in their investments.  An example:  Let's say I have $20mm.  I could go to a bank today and get a $40mm house.  However, my taxes, upkeep, mortgage, and other lifestyle expenses would likely cause me to deplete my original 20mm within a few years.<p>6.  When you're rich, its very difficult to deviate from an expected lifestyle.  Once you spend 60k on a car, 90% of the time your next car will be more.  This is true of houses and everything else you purchase.  My advice is pace yourself.",1279130766

The only other real option is to run Redis on its own EC2 instance, which costs $62 minimum (well, once you're sure the thing's sticking around, you could make it a reserved instance I guess). Now, that's a lot more powerful, but if I'm using something that doesn't even need the 100MB of RAM, I might as well save some money and use Redis to Go.<p>Plus you get the added bonus of still not having to worry about any piece of your infrastructure.",1279130646
