I often took my work home and worked 13 hours each day for years. I earn relatively well and I am the highest paid developer in our firm.<p>In the past one two years however, my motivation has been on a steady decline. I have largely lost my interest in IT, partly because it no longer feels challenging, but also because I feel <i>inactive</i>.<p>I would love to do something else, optimally something that requires my being physically active. I am more athletic than 99% of my peers, doing at least 12 hours of sports every week, and I would love to expand on that.<p>However, throwing away all that I know feels wrong, it is the capital that I have built on, and I don't want to take a large cut on my salary. Perhaps more importantly, I need the prospect of advancing my career.<p>Any idea for jobs that are both well paid and require a lot of physical work? Of course, the right mix of physical work and science would be perfect, but I am guessing that such a thing does not exist?",1279130380
1515386,comment,1514779,1514779,0,0,patio11,,,"I think oral and written communication is probably the most overlooked skill for engineers.  Write.  It gets easier with practice.  As you get better at it, it will come more naturally and you will be more confident.  Quality, fluency, and confidence all make people much more likely to believe what you are saying and act favorably towards your suggestions.<p>At a practical level, you can write your way into jobs (or investment), and if you do it right writing does not rot, so you can continue to reap benefits from things you've written long before.  That lets you store time in a bottle, which has really nice implications for time-strapped entrepreneurs.<p>(This also implies that you'd probably be better doing public writing than writing which winds up in the email archives of BigCorp or behind a logistical and cultural wall almost nobody will pierce at your institution of higher learning.)",1279130376

1515372,comment,1514688,1514967,0,0,stcredzero,,,"(Please don't take the following as something disparaging about your position.  It's not.  Rather, it is some general observations about markets.)<p>The previous comment would seem to be implying that there's ""a real fundamental value buried in the noise"" for investment instruments, but none for models.  I would say that there's always real fundamental value in people, models included, and that this value is in some sense more real than anything in any market.<p><i>The momentum is the only source of value.</i><p>The momentum is the only source of value modulo the market.  There is indeed ""a real fundamental value"" to all personnel assets, but it isn't even ""buried in the noise.""  The problem is that the market is almost totally disconnected from this underlying reality.  (The question seems too complex, to ever be fully connected.)<p>There is a sort of fear and insecurity that overtakes tastemakers faced with overabundant choices with no good analytical tools to help them.  I'm not sure what the solution is.  An ""indy"" market is no solution -- these seem to merely become the ""bush leagues"" for their preexisting mainstream.  After awhile in cultural markets, the noise machine takes over the market and disconnects it from the human and cultural perceptual machinery which gave rise to it.  (Which I will call ""true taste."")  Subcultural 'scenes' arise with a renewed connection to true taste, but these scenes eventually get swept up into the same disconnected market.<p>I suspect that Buddhism talks about this.  I suspect that this is just a part of the human condition.  Things like Rotten Tomatoes can help, in that rogue tastemakers who are simply succumbing to bribes and other simple manipulations can be left out in the cold.   Maybe the 4chan folks have got it right, and informational/social anarchy is the ultimate solution.<p>In the meantime, a dispassionate analysis of such markets might yield opportunities to make money through trading.",1279130056

Scrum is simply a framework of team commitment and forces frequent communication (one of the principles). Typically if people complain about agile or scrum it is because they really do not understand that iterative development is and has been done for years and recognizes that requirements are perishable and maintaining them expensive and wasteful.
