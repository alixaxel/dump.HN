Looks prettier when active I think, although when not the glass becomes more transparent and since there's so much of it, toolbars from applications underneath it seem to show through a lot, which creates a lot of visual noise. That's not entirely Firefox's fault, and it looks okay when it has focus, so it could be worse.<p>Seems faster to start, although it's disabled every addon I had before, so hardly a fair test.<p>In general it seems to be more like Chrome.

1492894,comment,1492835,1492835,0,0,btilly,,,"To this should be added some information for would-be rescuers of drowning people.<p>The instinctive drowning response is a <i>climbing</i> response.  What you see are twin splashes as the person's arms flail wide looking for something to grab on to.  If they find it the automatic response is to grab it, climb up, and stand on top.  The person doing this is panicked and has massively more strength than you think.  If you are swimming and a young child does that to you, you will go under water.  If you panic, you will get the same reflex, and will drown yourself.<p>Therefore if you wish to rescue someone who is drowning, you have 4 basic options.<p>1. The most common response is to go to them and try to rescue directly.  If the water is shallow enough that you can stand, letting them climb up you can be OK.  Otherwise this is suicide.  Frequently one drowning leads to multiple others, and this is exactly how they get started.<p>2. Keep your distance and hand them something to climb on.  They can't see a pole to grab it, but if they touch, they will climb, which gives them air.<p>3. Wait until the drowning person is unconscious.  Then go to them and tow them in.  If you can't stand in the water, and don't have anything to do 2) with, this is recommended.<p>4. (For trained people only.)  Swim up <i>behind</i> them, grab them from where they can't grab you, and lift them up to get air.  Talk soothingly to them until they relax, and then tow them in.  If they get hold of you, <i>DIVE</i> so they let go, back off, circle around, and start again.<p>If you do not have lifeguard training then I strongly recommend against trying #4.  Unless you know how to do the eggbeater you won't know how to hold them out of water.  And if they grab you, you have surprisingly little time to make the correct response before you are drowning as well.<p>Oh yes, and another data point.  Drowning is the #1 cause of death in toddlers.  It is quiet.  It is fast.  Beware of the backyard pool.",1278462734

I'm reminded of Steve Wozniak's ""Work alone"" quote:<p><a href=""http://www.dailycommonsense.com/apples-steve-wozniak-work-alone-inspiration/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dailycommonsense.com/apples-steve-wozniak-work-al...</a><p>It seems that basically all truly innovative projects either came out of a single mind or of a small team that worked so closely together that they might as well have been one mind.  There seems to be a regression-to-the-mean effect as you add more people to a project: you eliminate truly bad ideas, but you also eliminate some truly good ones too.  Many ideas that <i>look</i> bad are really just different.<p>In some ways, I think this unfortunate, because working on a team is a lot more fun, IMHO, than working solo.

In money as well as in time.<p>When I was in college, I wasted a lot of time on Harry Potter fanfiction.  I justified it to myself as an investment.  I figured that I'd learn how to write better.  I was involved as a tech admin on one of the sites, so I figured I could polish my technical skills.  After all, where else could a college student actually write code that faced real-world traffic from real-world users?  And if nothing else, the fandom was 99.9% female, so I figured I might even end up with a girlfriend.<p>After about three years of this, I figured ""Who the fuck am I kidding?"" and realized that it wasn't an investment at all.  The hard part of writing is coming up with a believable plot and characters, and fanfiction didn't exercise that at all.  I was going into financial software, using Java and custom databases, and so my PHP/MySQL webapp was completely irrelevant to my professional experience.  Nobody really respected fanfiction anyway, so it's not like it was a resume boost.  And I still didn't have a girlfriend.<p>Except that in the end, it <i>was</i> an investment.  Three years after that, after a couple years in the financial software startup and then a failed startup of my own, I ended up getting back in touch with one of my friends from the fandom , who had since started a job at Google.  They were hiring.  Partially on the strength of her referral, and partially on the web skills that I'd built up since my time with that fansite, I ended up getting a job there.<p>Anyone remember Steve Jobs' commencement address, the one with the calligraphy story?  It's sorta like that.  We keep trying to structure our lives so that everything leads up to achieving our goals, but oftentimes, the goals themselves aren't apparent until we've reached them.  It's only in retrospect that we can put things together and say ""I meant  to do that, yeah really, I did.""",1278461519

The standard model in restaurant (and market) POS systems seems to be a large up-front cost of many thousands of dollars, followed by a yearly ""support contract"", which entitles the client to a ""free"" phone call to technical support as necessary. (Without an active ""support contract"", I've seen some pretty outrageous hourly rates for calls to tech support, and they will resolutely refuse to answer anything unless it's paid for.)<p>On top of this, the hardware used by these POS systems is absolutely terrible. The ""new"" hardware used by wait staff is basically a Blackberry with a tiny screen and a stylus which is easy to lose, sold by Symbol. The menu functions on them are complicated, and last I checked, the replacement costs rival a new iPhone.<p>...and there's a device out from Apple which attaches to the back of an iPhone and allows users to swipe credit cards through the iPhone. (Sorry Square, I really wish you had responded to even one of my emails, but it looks like that bus has left the station now.)<p>With competitors like these, you should be able to pretty successfully market a replacement using commodity hardware, open systems, and a yearly ""support contract"" that would entitle the customers to upgrades, etc.<p>One of the vendors, ""Digital Dining"", has only just recently started offering integration of menus into their customer's websites, and it's clunky as hell.<p>Your bigger challenge would be getting existing restaurants to convert.
