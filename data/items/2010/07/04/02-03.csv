1485012,comment,1484308,1484779,0,0,chriscardinal,,,"Google's always approached design as an objective engineering challenge and less as an artistic endeavor. As a result, their designs are minimalist, utilitarian, and functional, but they sometimes seem to give up the ghost when they attempt to build complex or unique software like Buzz or Wave that could benefit badly from someone with a passion for aesthetics and UX.<p>Regarding Android, I'm encouraged by news that Google picked up WebOS's lead designer, (as reported here: <a href=""http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/05/27/palm-loses-their-lead-webos-designer-to-the-google-android-team-others-may-follow/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2010/05/27/palm-loses-their-lead...</a>) as WebOS is often lauded as an intuitive and innovative user interface in a manner Android simply isn't.<p>When Douglas Bowman (Google's former lead designer) left the organization, he cited, among other things, a fastidious, over-engineered, design-by-committee-and-hard-numbers approach that drove him crazy. He mentioned an example where Google had A/B tested 41 shades of blue to determine which to go with. That's demonstrative of the greater issue their culture seems to suffer from: if you want to bring about creative or subjective change, you often need objective facts and figures—metrics lacking by artistic design's very nature.<p>I wrote briefly about Google's methods in a bit of a rant on Facebook's whiplash-inducing approach to design here: <a href=""http://www.htmlist.com/design/google-vs-facebook-interface-design-design-by-committee-vs-baptism-by-fire/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.htmlist.com/design/google-vs-facebook-interface-d...</a>, but in the end, it comes down to balance. I have high hopes for Android 3.0 because I'm hoping that they just shipped with what they had and told themselves they'd worry about making it pretty later. Later is now, evidently, and it will be really interesting to see what Google does in this next round, especially if they've removed the handcuffs and decided to trust their designers.",1278212216

'ci)' is much easier than selecting it with the mouse, and keeps your hands on the keyboard where they belong ;)<p>With nested parentheses, it does what you expect (affects the text contained by the innermost matching pair to contain your cursor - try it and see).<p>Other equally useful variants:<p>* i"" - ""inside double quotes"" - everything between double quotes<p>* i' - ""inside single quotes""<p>* iw - ""inside word"" - the word the cursor is on<p>* is - ""inside sentence"" - great for editing prose<p>* ip - ""inside paragraph""<p>There are also similar motions beginning with ""a"":<p>* a) - like i) but includes the parens (e.g. 'da)' deletes everything inside parens and the parens themselves)<p>* a"" - similarly<p>* aw - like iw but includes trailing whitespace.<p><i>(Update - I thought this deserved its own air, so I turned it into a blog post: <a href=""http://blog.samstokes.co.uk/post/767636740/vim-wizardry-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.samstokes.co.uk/post/767636740/vim-wizardry-1</a>  Bonus tip if you read to the end!)</i>",1278212122

The tax has to include local taxes. We've got a table from the state giving the rates for each location in the state.<p>There are 1.6 million rows in the table. The key is a thing called the ""location"", which is a state-assigned number. Fortunately, it turns out no zip+4 spans a location boundary, so we can use zip+4 to determine the rate. If the state's locations ever end up not being a superset of zip+4 places, then we'd have to go by the full address.<p>There is another huge table available from the state that lists every single address in the state and gives what location it is in. Of course, people don't always give their addresses in the canonical form that state uses. E.g., someone on ""Martin Luther King Blvd"" might enter ""MLK Blvd"", ""ML King Blvd"", and so on. Or they might say ""st"" instead of ""blvd"".<p>I'm sure a sufficiently clever and determined programmer could come up with heuristics to deal with that. E.g., if the state doesn't have an MLK street but does have MLK blvd, then it could guess that's what the user meant. If there are both, it might tell by street numbers if the ranges don't overlap, and of course there's a good chance those two roads would not be in the same zip code. So it is probably a tractable problem, but a pain in the ass that I sure don't want to deal with.<p>Now imagine having to do all this for all 50 states. Ugh.",1278211246

So when this book started with _only_ car, cdr and lambda and built all sorts of higher level things out of it, it was a real eye opener and I actually came to appreciate the value of a small simple core in a language.<p>I saw the videos before I read the book.
