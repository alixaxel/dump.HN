Many times when you're working with signals and antennas all you have is the theory and there's very little you can do to visualize what's actually going on, not to mention working in the analog domain always throws you some surprises.<p>Never in CS will you hear ""Well that's due to relativistic effects.""<p>Additionally there's the practical problem in EE that you rarely encounter in CS of actually building physical things.

1484908,comment,1482497,1482497,0,0,xenopia,,,"A summary of how United's ""business"" works:<p>1) Design an ""order form"" that looks deceptively like a renewal form for the regular local yellow pages. The goal is to confuse the recipient that this is a renewal for your local yellow pages that you already subscribe to. Make the return address of your company say ""YELLOW PAGES."" Take advantage of the fact that the term Yellow Pages and the walking fingers logo are not copyrighted.<p>2) Have your shady lawyer review your order form and add enough disclaimers to cover your ass and comply with postal regulations. Everything is spelled out in the fine print. This is not a bill. You are ordering a service to be included in our book. We are not affiliated with your local phone company. We are not even going to send this book to anyone except other ""subscribers"" and a few libraries, etc. We will also put you on a website.<p>3) Mass mail this ""Order Form"" to your database of business names across the country. The response rate is small. But as the $300 fee is relatively high and your actual cost is negligible, the payoff is worth it. Note that by ordering you are set up to auto renew your $300 order. The book is published twice a year.<p>4) Send customers a bill. Charge credit card, get a check. <i></i>Note that this could be an area where the prosecutor vastly overestimated the dollar amounts involved<i></i> The total count of incoming mail was for <i>order form</i> replies. A smaller fraction of those recipients would actually have paid the bill which presumably arrived later. \n-If customer uses a credit card to pay, set up auto renewal, per terms of order form.<p>5)Have book of names printed. How many to print? Well, you actually aren't obligated to print more than a handful, per the terms of the solicitation. Here is the crucial number to optimize because printing those books actually costs money. You need to print just enough to send to customers to show they got something. Did they send one to each customer? The prosecutor is alleging they did not based on records from the printer. Again though, they never said they would publish any specific amount or that as a subscriber you would get a copy yourself. Assuming they did actually send a book to each subscriber, then the scope of the dollar amounts involved would be much smaller than alleged, though still quite lucrative. \nSo why print and mail books at all? Two reasons. One is to maintain some defensibility to the business in case you ever end up in court (cough.) The second is so you have something to show the smaller subset of your customers who pay but end up complaining. When they try to file a credit card chargeback you can send them a book and prove some service was provided.<p>Now. Up to this point, we could be within the bounds of legality.  But the prosecutor seems to be alleging something more. Specifically that the number of names actually printed in the book was far below the number of paid orders. This would clearly be fraud. But maybe they did print every paid customer's name in the book. Maybe the prosecutor indeed has his accounting wrong and maybe United was hyper careful to keep their records in order. This is where the crux of the case will probably lie. To get access to the books though, the prosecutor had to get the indictment, and that's why he filed with the information he had.<p>6) Test, optimize,repeat. Mailings aren't cheap. You've got to try to keep that response rate up. Which zip codes do you mail to? Which customers can continue to be charged year after year? Are repeat mailings worth it? How many chargebacks can you handle before your credit card processor dumps you? Some database work is required to keep that mailing list optimal.<p>7) Build a website so you can provide additional ""service"" to your customers to increase response rates and cut down on the need to pay for all those expensive printed books. Hell, maybe even creating a web directory for small business might actually provide some value.  Start looking around for people who can help you build a website.<p>8) So now you've got this cash cow, but the problem is it is a deceptive business at best. You want to be a respected member of the community, and flash some cash out on the beach. No one can know what these mailings of yours look like. So you put your PO box in one state under one name, and you put your office in another state where you live under a name that sounds impressive. United Directories. You can tell everyone at cocktail parties that you are the premier publisher of B2B directories for specialized verticals, yada yada.. But that's not enough. You want to be part of something really fun and sexy, so you invest in this new software consultancy. Despite having very little to add to the business other than cash, charisma and perhaps innovative bookkeeping skills, you get to be Chairman and CFO. Finally.

Ignore those letters of inquiry from the FTC. You can make this work. Your brother was an idiot and got too sloppy.

Emily looked at me with an expression like, ""Really?  They would design a phone like that?""<p>So I told her to bust out the scotch tape and use it to insulate the gap.  I then made fun of the fact that she had to tape her $200 phone, and that the act of taping the phone actually did something useful.<p>Needless to say, we were both highly amused.  :D<p>... That is, we've both been amused until this very moment.  Emily left about 20min to run up to the grocery store, and I've been trying to call her ever since.  Each time I do, it goes straight to voicemail.  So I texted her asking why her phone was off, and she responded with ""It's not"".  She just called me, and the call was dropped.<p>This <i>never</i> happened with her old 3GS (now my phone).  To be clear, I called her 2 seconds after she walked out the front door.  So the phones were almost literally next to each other at the time.  We live in Petaluma, CA, which is about 30 minutes north of San Francisco, so it's not like we're out in the boonies.  Our 3GS always reads full bars + 3G, so even with the inaccurate bar algorithm it should still be at least two bars of reception.  Therefore the phones should always be capable of calling each other when they're almost directly next to each other.<p>So.... Strange.  I don't know where people are getting evidence that the iPhone 4's reception is <i>definitely improved</i>, but, consider for a moment that perhaps it's <i>definitely improved</i> in certain areas, but <i>definitely -worse-</i> in other areas.",1278205913

Undergrads and PhDs, yes, but schools often seem to see masters students as cash cows, because more of then pay full tuition (there aren't the same financial aid packages as for undergrad, or RA/TA stipends as for PhD students).<p>Though this doesn't relate to the situation in the linked article, which is someone who got both a bachelor's and masters from MIT.",1278205663
