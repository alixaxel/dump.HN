1531683,comment,1531441,1531643,0,0,masklinn,,,"> This argument comes up against haskell over and over again and I think it is because it has some merit.<p>Yes and no. As with many other things, there's a tradeoff between Haskell's purity and referential transparency and side-effecting constructs such as storing stuff in a local cache, which is what memoization does. You can't litter printfs or cache calls throughout your pure functions either, ""for some reason"". It makes sense that's it's a pain to do in a (non-IO/state) haskell function, because those are very much about mixing side-effects into the code.<p>A better solution would probably be to integrate memoization at the runtime level, with some compiler hints maybe. That way it becomes an implementation detail not an imperative side-effect, and the world is pure again.<p>Anyway yeah, if you can't bear with Haskell's constraints you can just use something else, such as MLs (in order not to give up static type safety). Whoop the fucking do.",1279623468

For me the biggest challenge was not to release the product though, but to keep working on it when no one is using it yet. Anyway, I think it's basically the same question of motivation.<p>I was thinking about writing a short post on this. I suspect this whole agile culture with releasing crappy version 1 and iterating may be misleading for some people. For example, I've never heard of authors iterating their fiction book - they write it and sell it. If they don't sell right away, they may sell it later, so it's not an immediate failure. I think maybe this, at least partially, may be applied to the software world. Games and iPhone apps pretty much fall into this model. But maybe webapps could somehow do the same. The point is, I see nothing really wrong with this attitude of working hard for some time, but not wanting to continue to invest your time and energy into the product after its release. It maybe be good for some products, but bad for other. The real problem is the current trend towards iterations and continuous development, which may fool some people and make them unhappy.",1279620402

But relative to the number of successful child abusers caught it's a pretty good statistic.<p><i>No, most people behave this way because they've been horribly and dangerously brain washed into behaving this way. So how do you ""fix"" them?</i><p>Agreed; this didn't seem to be what you were saying before. But now I see you were less suggesting they <i>were</i> sex offenders but that they should face the consequences too & this would limit their desire for prosecutions.<p>I disagree with this being the right approach. Where this process failed was the first officer who thought the images were fine but still escalated it; that officer should be someone experienced, qualified and serious enough to have said ""no, this is not a concern"" - perhaps after quickly talking to the parents.<p><i>Now back to our clerk. This person looked at some normal family photos and reacted by ruining someone's life. I think this person finding themselves the subject of such an investigation would be appropriate and effective at teaching people that this kind of bizarre behavior is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.</i><p><i>This</i> is a completely different point to one you were originally making - at least how it reads anyway. And I agree; there should be consequences if you deliberately ruin someones life. But if the clerk is acting in good faith (in a way that doesn't sync with the examples you highlighted) so I'd argue a serious word/caution is sufficient to show him/her that they made a mistake and to take more care in the future.<p><i>Would you seriously pick the author in that situation? Then I have some bad news for you...</i><p>I'd pick neither. end of.<p><i>But if we changed your example to me just seeing someone being strangled then I would call the police. Because I saw something extreme happening. I would not call the police if I saw two people hugging. See the difference?</i><p>Yes. Sadly it is not a comparable example - because two people hugging is not associated with anything sexual or inappropriate. I was trying to highlight the idea that you might see something that others found sexually enticing but that simply concerned you - in such a case you are not a sexually excited by the event, just concerned. This is the mentality of the clerk; and you are right it is a result of a messed up society.<p>What <i>should</i> have happened (assuming the clerk is still concerned enough in this perfect situation to have called the police) is the police man should have called the parents, chatted informally to assure himself that it was as he suspected and then left it at that.<p>The failure here appears to be societies attitude to child nudity followed quickly by maddening bureaucracy.",1279620245

Find ways to generate excitement on your side and actively seek it on a regular basis.<p>For me, in this phase I'm in, it's talking to entrepeneurs which really does help. I guess it's also about a supportive environment. Family and friends, people who believe in you and lift you up.",1279620125
