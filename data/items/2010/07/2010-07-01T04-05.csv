All that's surprising is how quickly they pulled the plug.<p>Today's smartphone market reminds me of the airline industry prior to deregulation. Since all phones are sold for roughly the same price (on contract) in the US - and you don't get a discount for avoiding a contract - there's really no price competition between handsets. The Kin would have had a shot if it was a choice between a $200 Kin and a $700 iPhone or Android, but at the moment superior quality is the only differentiator between smartphones.",1277960278

My employer doesn't really care which type it will be, they're more concerned about schedules etc. In fact, after I've got the time of my vacation approved, I'll just mark some days as paid and some days as unpaid and they don't mind.<p>With regard to vacation allocations, I play it safe: if I need anything longer than a week off, I'll request the absence in good time. This works well because a) they can project it into the project schedules and b) if I want six weeks off next fall, they really don't have a practical schedule for next fall yet, so I get implied priority.<p>Oh, and I work part time as well. There was more to that when I started it but basically it boiled down to them saying ""we'll rather keep a good guy working less for us than not at all"". I get roughly the same amount of work done as before, the shorter days just mean that if I want to take a half a day off and go cycling, that's actually the default mode of operation as nobody expects me to work till 5 or 6pm.",1277959962

It is how one re-acts at that moment of connection, with something wholly unknown to them that is the most basic of ethical moments. One has an essential responsibility to the Other (and of course the Other has a responsibility to the individual). A responsibility born at that moment of tension. To deny and reject the Other is to reject responsibility for one's own actions.

I pointed at the advantages of other languages/stacks. I said that while it's generally true you can get the job done in a variety of languages and tech mixes (anything that's Turing complete, eh?) it's still very important to pick the right mix, because it impacts other things. One of the things I mentioned was that it effects not just the quantity of folks you'll find on the market with that skill set, but also the quality and really the <i>kind</i> of person.<p>For example, if I had to wade through 100 random resumes from strangers for a dev job I had to hire for, I'd get very different kinds of people if it were for say a PHP stack versus if it were a Java stack or a Lisp stack. Very different folks, on average. To be more explicit, I'm confident there would be way <i>more</i> applicants if it were PHP, but way <i>better</i> applicants, on average, if it were Lisp.

If you pay a person ahead of time such that they don't have to think about any rewards while they're working, they perform better creative work. Offering a higher salary would more likely be the proper motivation for creative work.",1277957789

1477029,comment,1476723,1476871,0,0,danudey,,,"Well, you'll have to offer them equivalent worth to what they're making. I left a high-paying job at a company that didn't appreciate its geeks to go to a lower-paying job whose entire staff (except for three project managers and the accountant) were geeks. The founder started the company doing websites in Perl in the 90's, and grew it into a small-scale hosting/app dev company. It's still private, it's still owned by the two original partners, and they still work their asses off every day at the company. The result is an environment that is not only geek-friendly, but geek-run.<p>Did I miss the large paycheques? Sure. Did I miss the stress? Or people breathing down my neck for results, a week after they said they'd get me the information I needed but never did? Or being denied my vacation pay because my previous management-approved sick days (most of which I spent working from home) were suddenly 'excessive'? I didn't miss that at all.<p>It isn't about offering people a better <i>salary</i>, it's about offering people a better <i>package</i>. If you only offer $60k to someone who's making $70k, but give them 4 weeks paid vacation, let them work from home three days a week, and let them expense their cellphone data plans and home internet, they'll be more interested.<p>Especially once you interview someone, you can sometimes figure out what kind of perks will most appeal to them. Mac fanboy? Offer to buy them a new iPhone on launch day every time one is released. You've just gone from $60k to $60.7k, but the employee is going to appreciate it a lot more, since he'll never have to budget for it again.<p>Does he like to travel? Offer up extra paid vacation, and then add to that $3000 of 'travel expenses' per year, for personal use. That's usually enough to fly two people anywhere in the world, return, so he and his girlfriend can take a nice long trip to Europe after you ship version 1.05 and everyone's ready to unwind. The idea that he won't have to budget for it - that he can just suddenly decide to go to Laos or Mumbai or Morocco, even if his bank account is on empty - will be appealing. It's like a 'get out of town free' card.<p>Tell all your employees you'll pay an accountant to do their taxes for them. It's a huge hassle for most people, and if you take that away tax season gets far less stressful.<p>So many programming jobs I've seen offer high salaries, but with minimal benefits. You get a stock health package, minimal vacation, and MAYBE you get to expense PART of your phone bill, if you're an admin on call. Take away all the junk that people don't want to worry about and let them focus on being geeks.<p>It's hard to offer this sort of thing in a job posting, but if you can lure the good people in to an interview, this is how you get them on board.",1277956972
