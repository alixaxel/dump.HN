1526243,comment,1525797,1526197,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I used to work in financial software and very much disagree with aspiringsensei's advice.  There's a huge adverse selection problem with financial advisors: the ones who are any good at managing money can make far more at Goldman Sachs, which tends to leave the people who don't really understand what they're doing advising the retail investors.  The advice my sister got when she talked to a ""good"" (recommended by her employer) financial advisor was atrocious: it was based mostly on the theory that large dividend-paying companies never go out of business, which seems rather ironic considering he worked for Merrill Lynch, a large dividend-paying company that nobody would imagine would go out of business, and yet...went out of business in 2008.<p>I'd start by educating yourself on the mechanics of the market.  Read <i>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</i>, read Benjamin Graham, read Warren Buffett.  Learn to read an income statement and a balance sheet, and look at some historical stocks with income and assets in mind.  Figure out how <i>you</i> would manage your money if you had infinite time.  Then if you want, hire a financial advisor that manages money the same way you would, except has the time that you don't to actually investigate companies and keep an eye on their financial performance.<p>Also, keep in mind that an index fund is effectively free financial advice (that you always follow) from every market participant.  Essentially, you're saying ""I don't have time to make my own investment decisions, so I'm going look at the average of what everyone else is doing, and do that.""  That average will include everything from Goldman Sachs money managers and Warren Buffett down to retail investors and financial advisors.  It's capitalization-weighted though, so the people with the most money's ""votes"" count the most, which is usually what you want.",1279475494
1526242,comment,1525240,1526116,0,0,Mz,,,"I don't think it is accurate to say women (or anyone who is touchy-feely) are more backstabbing.  I do think it is accurate to say that touchy-feely types are generally inclined to be less direct (what you characterized as ""deceitful"") in the face of something socially unpleasant -- they seem to expect others to read between the lines, infer and so on.  When such subtleties fail, they often don't deal well with the ugliness which ensues.  Having written my above paragraph, it occurred to me that although I am a conflict-avoider and will go out of my way to avoid fighting with people, I seem more comfortable with direct confrontation than most women and that is probably one of the things that makes many people uncomfortable with me.  People find me ""combative"" although I really don't like to fight with people.  But if there is an issue, I generally prefer to be direct and prefer people being direct with me -- assuming there is no malice on both sides.  Where there is real malice, best to know when to shut up.<p>FWIW:  My experience has been that extremely suave, charming men are typically also untrustworthy.  They generally know how to manipulate people and usually don't hesitate to do so.  Of course, people who are both charming and have a strong sense of integrity make wonderful company.  But if I have to choose one or the other, I prefer integrity to charm.<p><i>Perhaps you are intending ""touchy-feely"" to mean non-genuine?</i><p>No, but I think there is some correlation between the two things.  People who want very much to make nice are inclined to tell ""little white lies"", which puts one on  a slippery slope.  I wish my experiences indicated otherwise.<p>I hope that is clearer.<p>Thanks.",1279475462
1526241,comment,1525797,1525949,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Okay, it takes effort to make me suspend my rule against politics on HN, but I have my limits. If you are some kind of troll, I nominate you for an Academy Award.<p>First: Social security is solvent, it will be solvent for years, and to fix it will require a minor tax increase decades from now. Quit believing propaganda.<p>Second: Our future budgetary problems are nonetheless real. But they are all about health care. If you really want to worry about balancing budgets in 2040, worry about that. Social Security is fine and will continue to be fine unless somebody deliberately fucks it up. (By talking like a fatalist, as you do, you inadvertently help the cause of the people who are trying to fuck it up; that is why we are having this little chat.)<p>Third: The major problem in the USA today is that we have a <i>massive excess of productive capacity</i>. Not only can the country afford to feed, clothe, house, and entertain you quite nicely, but our biggest problem is that after we did this we might <i>still</i> have too much capacity. The economy is not well designed for such a situation, and it needs fixing.<p>(Aside: The fix is called ""stimulus"", literally known as ""printing money"". People won't spend money? Make them spend it now. Create new money and give it away; make the old money move by threatening to inflate it away in the future. That nobody in power understands this, or that they pretend not to, is an epic failure of education and/or governance; the consequence will be millions of impoverishments and, likely, early deaths, perhaps even your own. Tragedy sucks.)<p>To the extent that the country <i>does not</i> choose to feed, clothe, house, and entertain you and everyone around you, it is a problem of government, economics, and politics. It is not that we are physically incapable. It is that we are not so organized.<p>The solution is to organize.<p>Where will ""the money"" come from? Money is not a physical thing, like platinum. It's some numbers in a spreadsheet by which we keep score: If your number is higher, you get to control more about what the economy does.<p>If you wake up and discover that all the money belongs to a handful of people who have gamed the ruleset by which money is distributed, and that they are failing to use their giant pile of money to direct the economy to keep everyone else fed, clothed, housed, and entertained to the correct extent: You change the rules, or you stop playing the game.<p>By many orders of magnitude, the best option is to change the rules. Or, rather, to change one rule, to turn one knob that was <i>designed</i> to be turned: Raise taxes on the people with the money.<p>That anyone <i>contemplates suicide</i> rather than go down fighting for this simple rule change is a triumph of modern propaganda.<p>Get up out of the fetal position and be an American, for the love of all that is holy.",1279475419
