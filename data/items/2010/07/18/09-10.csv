1525507,comment,1524869,1525353,0,0,kragen,,,"You can absorb EM radiation just fine with an antenna that's ""too long"". It's when it's too short that you run into problems.<p>500nm-wavelength light oscillates at about 600 terahertz, with a period of about 1.7 femtoseconds. If you want to rectify that and turn it into DC current so you can run current semiconductor devices, you need a diode that can switch on once and off once in that period of time. So your forward recovery time plus your reverse recovery time needs to total less than 1.7 femtoseconds. Among other things, I think this implies that the depletion region in the diode needs to be less than 0.9 femtoseconds in width --- at the electron drift velocity of the semiconductor, which I think is typically around 12 orders of magnitude less than c, although in silicon it can be as high as only three orders of magnitude less than c. Which means that your depletion region needs to be 3 orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength. Unfortunately the wavelength we're talking about here, at around 1000nm, is only four orders of magnitude bigger than a smallish atom, at 0.1nm. So you're pushing up against the bounds of possibility here with an insulating depletion region of a few atoms in thickness.<p>Forward and reverse recovery times for silicon diodes vary widely. Typical values for discrete components are measured in the tens to hundreds of nanoseconds. Schottky diodes bring that down to tenths of nanoseconds. One nanosecond is one million femtoseconds, so that's still five orders of magnitude too slow.<p>Anyway, I don't know anything about this stuff, really.",1279446576

I meant to compare the US to similar sized nations, like the Roman or Mongul Empires. It wouldn't be possible to get figures to back this up, it's just an estimate on my part.<p>In terms of debt and poverty, I would say that the US has the financial burden of having the most powerful military in the world. In many ways that also speaks to quality of life. While we may have higher levels of poverty and crime when compared to scandinavian nations, our citizens don't have to live at the whims of foreign military powers. National security is something that doesn't factor into many quality of life charts. I still stand corrected, but it's something to consider.",1279446485

In fact after the middle of the 19th century you would have a hard time finding a monarchy that performed even remotely as well as a republic of the same time. (Of course, for this comparison, one would consider ""monarchies"" that are just republics pretending to be monarchies, such as 20th century England, or Sweden to be republics).<p>Of course you will find plenty of well performing monarchies in previous historical periods, but that does not mean that your statement is true today. Government is actually a matter of technology (among other things) and a republic is just too complicated and hard to pull off with ancient communications technology.<p>Regarding the US, you are obviously referring to Lincoln and FDR, but you are really going overboard comparing them to dictators.

1525491,comment,1525269,1525386,0,0,nopinsight,,,"This got me thinking about Singapore, which has recently overtook the US on the basis of GDP (PPP) per capita. Singapore's system is officially democratic, but in fact quite authoritarian with competent rulers. The direction of the country has been in control by the Lee family for decades, but they put a lot of smart 'commoners' to some of the highest posts in the country. And given the track record, few can argue against the ability of the Lee family in the areas of economic and overall <i>material</i> development. The city-state also has little corruption and its citizens receive some of the best education in the world.<p>Does the example imply that such a ""meritocratic monarchy"" is the most rapid way to develop a country economically?",1279446038

Your statements make sense (in retrospect and with your evidence) but, at least here in the States, it is almost 180 degrees opposite to the political consensus.<p>Your above quote reminded me of the Civilization PC games, especially the early ones that just have a simple ""government type"" instead of an attribute matrix.

1525486,comment,1525269,1525420,0,0,hooande,,,"I won't question that american leaders have acted like dictators at times. Though technically, they were all still democratically elected and subject to impeachment.<p>From my knowledge of history, a representative democracy is just more efficient than a dictatorship. It's true that monarchs can reduce corruption, waste and crime to zero. But I think that the US has been a prime example of the positive tradeoffs that come from those things. An analogy would be a startup that only ships bug free code. It's good, but they'll probably get outperformed by a more nimble company that tolerates defects here and there.<p>Personally, I think that many of your examples of empires that outperformed republics (specifically Rome vs Greece) are a result of conquest and military power. A young empire can do a much better job of fielding an army than a young republic can. But as the US proved in world war 2, a mature and functioning republic has a much greater capacity for production because it utilizes the skills of more of it's citizens. I think a lot of that is because we were isolated from many other powerful empires on the american continent so we had time to mature to our capacity.<p>Think of it almost like a game of Starcraft or Age of Empires. If you have one player in ""Republic mode"" and another player in ""Dictator mode"", the dictator will get more resources in the beginning allowing him to crush the republic. But if the republic is given time to build, he'll have a resource advantage in the long run. Which is why I'm still not so sure that a well-run monarchy can outperform a republic.",1279445787
