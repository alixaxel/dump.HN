Now that we've got bandwidth figured out, it's time to tackle latency.<p>A coworker ran a speed test on his AT&T iPhone 4 in NE Portland at lunch and got about 1.4mbps down with a 150ms ping.

The bandwidth question is highly network-dependent, and almost entirely moot once you're beyond the 800k mark -- especially with a low-latency ping, which is likely the biggest bottleneck when browsing the web.<p>We need device manufacturers and carriers to work closely, striving to reduce latency in mobile connections.

1479656,comment,1478108,1478108,0,0,bdickason,,,"I played competitively from 97-2003. Quake, UO, EQ, Halo, WoW, Tekken Tag, Call of Duty, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, etc.<p>I dropped it all for a few years and got into DJing.<p>The whole time I was building software.<p>For me, I thought it was the competitive spirit. I thought I needed something to be 'better' at. But when I went back to WoW about a year ago, I found that I could play by myself and I just needed something to be 'obsessed with' or 'addicted to.'<p>As such, I've stopped gaming and focused my 'obsession' on my startup! I still have a life, go out, etc, but my free time is comprised of reading hackernews, building things, or working on launching.<p>So to answer your question... yes, I gave up gaming. I still play the occasional game but if I can't put 100% of my time into it, it's not fun.<p>The few things I've found over the years that helped me alot:
1) Find someone else competitive and play a console game for 30 minutes per day... like during lunch. A co-worker and I played Street Fighter 4 and it was great. We kept a strict timeclock on it and it gave me my 'fix.'<p>2) Get an iPhone, download a new game each week, and play it on the way to/from work. Obviously this works better for me being in NYC and riding the subway, but I'm sure you can find a way to make it work for you.<p>3) Don't read gaming blogs/websites casually. I find this to be the #1 thing that sucks me back in and instead I choose to read startup stuff.<p>I suspect that as more and more former 'hardcore' gamers snap out of it and start applying their talents elsewhere (other than counterstrike websites!), you'll see a bunch of quality programmers and designers emerge.<p>3/4 of my staff played games competitively or 'seriously' and the majority only play 1-2 per month. They are all amazing at what they do. I hope they don't all quit when Starcraft 2 comes out :(<p>Edited to add: I actually landed my current job because I played video games. A video game tournament company in NYC wanted to hire someone to run their website and I've worked my way up since.",1278027934

Incorrect. This is a deliberate misreading of the original post ( <a href=""http://blog.posterous.com/make-the-switch-to-posterous"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.posterous.com/make-the-switch-to-posterous</a> ) which states:<p><pre><code>  You grouched about dying platforms that haven't added 
  new features in ages, sites that have made it too 
  complex to perform the most basic tasks and places 
  that smother your content in ads.

Again from Andrew's post:<p><pre><code>  Threats of lawsuits are reported, and to me this isn’t 
  about the tools or privacy, it is about a company being 
  a dick and the legal response to just that.

There are many possible interpretations of the situation, but companies generally don't bring out the lawyers because another company is ""being a dick"".<p>Again from Andrew's post:<p><pre><code>  Saying switching to your service is fine, but by 
  discrediting them, both the community behind them

  history of the site, which, a lot of people care

I don't see him backing this up anywhere in the post. He makes a big leap from Posterous lacking ""community"" features and saying some of the  platforms they're writing exporters for are dying, to ""discrediting"" the communities behind sites and ""attacking"" the full history of those sites.<p>Then, there's the repeated use of the derogatory ""Preposterous"", which is roughly equivalent to the old ""Windoze"" or ""Crapintosh"".<p>So, again, in my opinion:<p>- the post was trolling<p>- the post is misleading<p>The trolling alone was enough for me to flag the post.",1278026907
