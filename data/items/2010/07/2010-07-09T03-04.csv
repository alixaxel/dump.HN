I agree that you don't want too many options.  You want just enough flexibility.<p>I think a really innovative approach would be a pledge/rescind model.  Let people freely pledge up front up to a certain liberal limit then present them with the registration, payment, tedious paperwork all at once after the fact.  Let them welsh out on as many pledges as they want. What is a pledge that is later rescinded worth? Less than a penny obviously but more than nothing at all.

The kind of humour I enjoy includes dry self deprecation and obscure and nerdy tech jokes, and I literally am part of the reason why women don't get into computer science jobs. You can actually see the repulsive magnetic fields lines as they form patterns at a distance from me at parties, not quite knowing why they need to move but doing so anyhow. And you know what? I have the personality of leader, and I'm going to develop myself into more of one, and women can just go to guys like you when they want to tingle and shit.<p>> Do you have other interests besides programming - travel, books, movies, anything?<p>No, a little (and I recognize where your usernane is from), yes if I'm sitting with a girl, and some other things that vary over time, including most that are stereotypically male interests. (E.g. I love watching UFC with friends at a bar.)<p>But anyway, I apologize if it appears like I'm playing a version of Eric Berne's game ""Why don't you...? yes but..."", or ressentiment or glorifying my own powerlessness or whatever. I'm really not after help, though I recognize you and others would sincerely like to provide it.<p>I'm just pointing out that online dating really isn't the best path for everyone, especially for someone like me. I really am likable to some, but I just take a long time to get to know, and it has to be in person over time, and it can't be the sort of whiny entitled women online who are smart enough to understand the economics of scarcity:) My own best strategy will be a two-pronged attack - make a ton more money and get a lot more power (in my view, this is more honest than clowning my way through some speed seduction value elicitation NLP bullshit that revolts me). And along with it get off the internet more and do some things where there is continual interaction with women. Sometimes, I know from experience, even though such things aren't that enjoyable at first, they can take on a life of their own... E.g. the idea that supposedly Sartre got into philosophy to pick up girls.",1278647590

Thus you don't have to scrub as large a volume of air in order to get the same effect.<p>One HN-oriented analogy is conditioning heat out of a data center.  If you wait till the heat coming off your servers mixes uniformly throughout the entire room, you have to process a lot of air.  If on the other hand you catch the air just as it comes off the servers, you have to process less air in order to remove the same energy.<p>Pushing the analogy further-- at normal temperatures (for data centers and for the ultimate place they reject heat to, the outdoors), processing a small amount of air that starts at a high temperature can be done more cheaply than a large amount of air that starts very close to the temperature you want to maintain.  By analogy, it's probably true that scrubbing a fixed amount of NOx is easier when you start at a high concentration, than when you have a greater volume at lower concentration.",1278646587
