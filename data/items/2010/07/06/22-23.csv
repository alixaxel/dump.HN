Several people at my work went on the so-called paleo diet together and immediately started losing significant weight.<p>If you look at most popular diets, they generally have the core effect of deemphasizing high glycemic foods from one's diet, usually by shifting calories to meat and/or vegetables.<p>Personally, I prefer to shift the calories to meat because it's easier to build strength and muscle, when paired with an appropriate physical regimen.

1492626,comment,1492159,1492159,0,0,lmkg,,,"I was browsing around the Wikipedia articles for Cellular Automata recently, and the thing that struck me about it is how easy it is to notice, if not understand, the levels of abstraction. You start with the rules of Conway's Game of Life and a few samples, easy enough. You think in terms of what a cell does. Then you learn about oscillators, periodic self-sustaining patterns, which aren't that surprising, and still on the level of individual cells.<p>Then you learn about Gliders, a simple pattern that in four generations gives rise to a copy of itself, but translated 1 cell away. Now we're not talking about what cells are doing anymore. We're talking about what patterns are doing, and they can move around independently from the cells used to represent them. It's a layer of abstraction.<p>You find out about objects like Reflectors, where when a Glider collides with it, the result is a Glider in a different direction, and things like the Glider Gun that periodically produces a new glider. You start arranging these things together to get a nice little circuit, and soon the Gliders aren't even the object of study anymore, they're just little blips that other things use to pass information. Instead of just the patterns, you now think in terms of the interactions between the patterns, which is another layer of abstraction.<p>And you can grok these successive layers of abstraction in 15 minutes of reading a little explanatory text and watching animated .gifs. I think the fact that Conway's Life is inherently a very visual phenomenon makes it easier to understand like that.<p>The article covers a lot of breadth of cellular automata. I think you get a lot more out of it if you have a tiny bit of depth in one particular automata first, so you can understand in a general sense the cool patterns and phenonema that it talks about.

In my experience, which is limited to those two cities, I've found that the base level of noise is higher in the cities regardless of time.  Trash trucks, ambulances, police cars, delivery trucks, drunks walking home, cabs cruising for fares, and tons of other noisy events occur at all times of day and with a greater frequency than I experienced in the suburbs.<p>I overreacted to earl's post.

Before he made big decisions, he wrote out on the notepad pros/cons and weighted each point with a number from 1-5, depending on how important each was to him.  Then he would total it, and the side with the highest number wins.

There is no way someone can tell me, what with Twitter, Youtube, MySpace, Facebook, and the whole gang, that Joe Shmoe can't advertise himself and his company or products, and has to spend a fortune for it. It might have been like that 10 years ago, but nowadays, you can be famous for absolutely nothing.<p>Example: Some fellow films his cat lying with his paws up and snoring, and narrating in the background that he's not as lazy when it comes to his business. It's so funny that everyone starts looking at it - and thereby the business being advertised. Viola. Free online advertising, and he reached hundreds of thousands in an hour. :-)",1278453972
