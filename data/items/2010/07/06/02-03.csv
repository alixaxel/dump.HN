This means that modern Icelanders can read the Sagas (written in the 10th and 11th centuries) with relative ease. The majority of people will read them in the same way we read Shakespeare or Dickens (with modern spelling and some footnotes), but with some effort they can be read by most well-educated Icelanders in their initial forms.<p>While isolation had a great deal to do with this initially, nowadays it's mostly because of the work of the Icelandic Language Institute, which religiously updates the language to add new words for concepts that didn't previously exist. They also work with the Icelandic Naming Committee, to maintain the list of acceptable first names that Icelandic children can be given - if the name you want to give your child isn't on the list of previously-used names, you have to submit it to the Committee to make sure that it is appropriate (i.e. can be spelled in the Icelandic alphabet and fits into Icelandic grammar).",1278385189

More akin to VC investing: I look for 20x based on macro trends or interesting opportunities (scalable growing companies in a huge market).<p>One really basic way of looking at this is something like Baidu and Google.<p>Baidu (BIDU) is the Google of China.  The market cap is ~ 25b while GOOG is ~130b.<p>With the growing middle class in China and the sheer market size, it would seem more likely that BIDU would become the size of GOOG rather than go bankrupt.<p>This is just an example, but I have owned BIDU, based on this principle for 4 years (it was under 100 and it recently split 10-1)<p>Another sector where this strategy works is in biotech.

Each drive was brought online out of the storage pool, its files copied into the pool volumes, and finally the drive was added to the storage pool. It requires an extra drive already in the pool to pull this off, but given that it worked very well, far better than some of the horror stories I've heard about people trying to transplant RAID 5 and 6 setups when other NAS solutions have failed at the server level. A part of me of course wishes for a ZFS-style WHS, and perhaps MSFT will get there some day, but in the meantime I can certainly see how WHS's design decisions were reached.",1278384037

So what if there are no absolute metrics. That doesn’t seem to matter all that much.<p>If I count my sheep on their way out of the pen and if I count them again on their way back into the pen I can be reasonably sure that if those numbers match, there are no more sheep on the pasture. I don’t have to look for missing sheep. This seems like a useful statement. I would call it true.<p>Sure, sometimes it doesn’t work. Tests with other people have shown that I sometimes tend to overlook a sheep. Further tests have shown that I sometimes misremember the number by the time the sheep are coming back. But other than that it seems very robust.<p>Why not call that statement true? Do postmodernists expect that this would only work here but not in other cultures? And if that were the case couldn’t you just test that, no need to throw your hands up in the air and give up? Do they expect that it might work on Earth but maybe not on Mars or Alpha Centauri? Testing that would also be no problem. It’s at least not impossible, no reason to give up.<p>Where’s the beef?<p>(The sheep story is blatantly stolen from this essay: <a href=""http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://yudkowsky.net/rational/the-simple-truth</a>)",1278381871
