Block out most of your work-day/week with meetings with yourself and reject conflicting meeting requests. People who try to schedule meetings with you will see the conflict and probably try to avoid it to start with, plus it's easier to justify not going to meetings if you have a conflict, even if it's just time you've blocked out for yourself to get things done.<p>Additionally, if you are able you can work from home fairly often, making sure to mention that it's to concentrate on specific tasks, you'll miss all your meetings for that day but you'll get work done.

1489201,comment,1489029,1489178,0,0,_delirium,,,"Yeah, that makes sense, but somehow Derrida himself doesn't seem the most objectionable to me, at least on philosophical grounds.<p>I suppose one can legitimately blame him for some of the writing style, though. In particular, although he argued that all language has multiple meanings / shifting references / etc., he seemed to like emphasizing it by using a writing style that added deliberate multiple readings. For example, something like ""we need to (re)construct this meaning"", leaving it deliberately ambiguous, with a sort of self-aware textual wink, whether he was ""constructing"" or ""reconstructing"" things. Also, lots of puns.<p>I think he actually pulled it off reasonably well in some parts, and is kind of amusing to read, if you like that sort of thing. In the years since, it's become a really annoying habit that a bunch of folks have picked up, though, most of whom don't do it very well, and take it way too seriously. Now I have this instinctive ""argh, I hate you"" reaction whenever I see some paper or book title with a construction like ""(re)engage"".<p>edit: An interesting oddity is that a lot of the writing style traces back to Nietzsche, even though he himself was quite readable (so much so that teenage kids loving Nietzsche are even a sort of stereotype). He initiated some of the general style of writing half philosophy, half literary performance: jumping from subject to subject, making assertions that you run with and don't carefully argue for, making heavy use of puns in arguments, etc. Maybe the problem is just that most people who try to write like that need to realize that they aren't Nietzsche, and can't pull it off.",1278366606

1489196,comment,1488951,1488951,0,0,ttol,,,"What you're looking for is Windows Home Server.  It's amazing.  Stores all the media you need, plus has streaming capabilities over the net.  Able to expand perpetually -- no need to reformat or anything like that.  I have it running with 10TB of space. It has a great front-end UI, and as close to zeroconf as you can get with this type of service. See exampel screenshot: <a href=""http://ivivo.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/windowshomeserver_28server_storage291.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ivivo.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/windowshomeserver_2...</a><p>EDIT: Forgot to mention one of the biggest pluses.  Microsoft pioneered a special file system for WHS called Drive Extender.  There are no drive letters, just folders, and it spans across all your hard drives and future hard drives. No more ""oh that video is in H:, oops I mean K:"", it's just ""It's in the video folder."" See: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Home_Server#Drive_Extender"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Home_Server#Drive_Exten...</a><p>The best thing is that WHS is tightly integrated with Windows, so it has things like autobackup (selective and not), health monitoring (if any of the PC's hooked up at your home springs an alert, like virus found, or low disk space, etc, it notifies the other computers through dismissable systray popup), central user/password management across all your machines, and other cool things.  Many companies have also developed plugins for WHS as well (useful things like PerfectDisk for defragmentation).  It also works/integrates with Mac environment.<p>For playback of media content, I have two HTPCs connect from two different rooms as well as some Xbox 360's (yea, the xboxes just found the folders and was able to play the content. it just <i>works</i>).  Also, I installed Air Video to stream videos to ipad/iphone.<p>And since it needs to be always-on, I hooked up a UPS battery to it.  It's headless -- just the machine is needed, which is great for a server in the closet.  You'll manage the WHS through remote desktop/web ui.  You'll also want to get the Rosewill RSV-S8 -- you will need more and more space! (Some people have gone the ""octopus"" -- lots and lots of external hard drives hooked up through USB.  I initially went this route but the throughput became a bottleneck so I got the Rosewill - See: <a href=""http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16816132016"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newegg.com/product/product.aspx?Item=N82E16816132...</a>).<p>Some use-cases: I've got private directories for myself, then I've got public directories such as Photos and Videos, with Photos being writable by certain members of the family.  This means I can create a folder, say ""07.04.10 July 4th in Boston"", and each of us can upload our iphone/camera images to that folder.  Now we have a global picture folder for the event we shared together.  With Videos, since WHS supports Windows Media Center as well as just normal file streaming, I outfitted my WHS box with 1GBit ethernet card and the machine can stream out files to each of the HTPCs and other consuming devices.<p>Oh yea, the new Windows Home Server release coming out later this year is going to be even better.  If you've got an MSDN subscription, download it and mess with it.  You won't be disappointed.  It's one of the best products Microsoft has put out.",1278366574

I appreciated the author's relatively minor discussion of the disease data and more expansive discussion of the rest. For completeness: when I say 'GWAS' in this context I am referring to 'common SNPs' (MAF>=5%, or perhaps down to 1%), not to genome-wide association studies based on the SNPs. I used to argue with my labmates about the proper use of the term 'GWAS': I felt that it should refer to the studies only, and 'common SNPs' should be called 'common SNPs'; my labmates preferred to call common SNPs 'GWAS data' and I've finally been converted.<p>Anyways, I do think that expression+GWAS is useful, but it's not going to get us to a place that's better than history for most diseases.[1] Exome and then genome sequencing will be needed for that.<p>[1] = On the other hand, Purcell has an interesting paper out that discards the genome-wide significance threshold, with interesting results.",1278366537

Your genetic profile is currently less useful than a proper history and physical exam (but mostly just history) in predicting risk for the vast majority of diseases.<p>This may change, but the extent to which the GWAS data from 23andme will be useful for imputation of the (as yet undiscovered) causal variants that we'll be discovering in the near future is currently unclear.<p>So in the meantime, enjoy every aspect of their services, but I would encourage you to put little emphasis on their disease predictions. The fact that you don't have one of the known breast cancer mutations doesn't mean that you don't have a novel one. The fact that you are predicted to have high risk of heart disease doesn't mean that you don't have a novel cardioprotective allele elsewhere.
