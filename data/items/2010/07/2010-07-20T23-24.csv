1533876,comment,1533817,1533817,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Probably yes.<p>I've heard that some people have had success at negotiating down the scope of their IP assignments to ""Anything directly related to the company is yours, anything not directly related is mine"", but it comes down to negotiating leverage.  Basically, you need to be a bigshot in your industry and they need to be a relatively small, desperate company for this to work.  They have to want you more than you want them, because otherwise they know that everyone else will require equally restrictive IP agreements.<p>As for how people manage to work on side projects - usually, if they become companies, the employee has to negotiate an explicit agreement with their employer to retain ownership.  For the Apple I, Woz initially believed that HP owned the rights to it, and then some middle-manager at HP signed it away.  For Viaweb, I believe there was a panic at some point where some Yahoo pointed out that it was quite possible that Altavista owned the rights to their code (since RTM worked there one summer) and they needed to get some manager there to sign off on it.  PG may be able to tell you more if he's reading this.<p>Another common strategy founders do is write the prototypes and perform market research while still employed, and then throw everything away and start fresh when they form the company.  Usually the scope of IP only extends to code (& design docs & other written descriptions), because if it's not written down, you can't prove when they dreamed it up.  This was the Netscape strategy: write Mosaic, quit and rewrite it as Netscape.  They got sued for it anyway, but I think it was for trademark infringement and not copyright infringement.",1279670371

These asset types are not as liquid as the US dollar yet, but within certain trading networks they can be quite useful.<p>Regarding money ""laundering,"" that used to be defined as concealing the proceeds of crime.

Microsoft bills .NET as a framework, but from a practical perspective it's really a big collection of libraries (and languages) which is great. ASP.NET, and to a lesser extent ADO.NET, although theoretically sub-collections of libraries, are really more like frameworks. And while some of their features are nice (e.g. forms authentication), you recognize the maze of factories building factories when something cleaner (like jQuery) comes along.

I quit my job and I've been working full-time on the site towards the first launch for the past 2 months.  I pretty much do everything by myself (from slicing PSD to sysadmin to coding the back-end to writing the Ajax interface, you name it, I do it).  But I sometimes feel a bit lonely working all day, and I'd love to have somebody to bounce ideas with.  I talked to friends over IM, but that's about it for my social life at the moment.  It's a good reason that YC doesn't accept startup with single founder, since based on my experience so far, it's a real challenge to stay motivated and passionated about the project for an extended period of time.  Having a co-founder to talk to is an amazing boost of morale and productivity, but I have to do what I have to do.<p>A few days ago I ran into a post here on HN about pair programming, and I thought it is a great idea.  If you're free, and you want to do some pair programming, just ping me!  I'm available on Skype and Yahoo Messenger as ""alexnhatle"".   I start my day around 10AM CST and call it a day around 2AM CST (sometime a bit later if need to).<p>I'm using Rails 3b4, PrototypeJS, and TDD as much as possible.  I wouldn't call myself a Rails expert or anything, I still learn stuff as I go.  As a self-plug, here's a small project that I built for fun after quitting my job, written in JavaScript with PrototypeJS:  http://alexle.net/experiments/jsdtd/ (code at http://github.com/sr3d/jsdtd).<p>Look forward to hearing from you!<p>Cheers!<p>Alex",1279668941

There's thousands of years of practices and traditions meant to improve/structure the act, but I never really thought of those as being aimed at someone like myself.  As a result, most of my exposure, up until a few months ago, was either through articles like this one or occasionally at the end of martial arts workouts.<p>But I spent a part of this summer working on a farm in rural Wisconsin and I ended up with a period of downtime in the early evening - after the day's work and catching up with emails and whatnot.  As it turns out, I was also struggling with a particular quandary (specifically, I was trying to define 'value') and one day, I just sat down cross-legged on the porch with my eyes closed, facing the setting sun.<p>What I did from there is hardly what any sort of zen master would consider 'meditation,' but I was amazed at what a difference it made to simply make a conscious decision to sit and think only of one topic.  Consequently, I was reminded of a zen koan that I had encountered earlier in my investigation of the meaning of value, which was edifying enough for me to feel okay with calling what I had started doing 'meditation.'<p>I guess the bottom line is not to put too much stake in what everyone else says meditation is or isn't and focus on the practice of just taking time to be alone with your thoughts long enough to organize them in such a way that makes sense for you.  Again, this is strictly anecdotal, but I think that's where you'll really see many of the benefits associated with meditation coming from.

A lot of the time, map/reduce in CouchDB is used to create something similar to a ""view"" in SQL. This is an incremental process and is automatically done for adding only changed documents to the result the next time it is called.
In Riak, map/reduce doesn't have this fancy feature.<p>A big plus for Riak is the fact that you can actually shard riak automatically. Couch has to be sharded manually which destroys map/reduce.",1279666858
