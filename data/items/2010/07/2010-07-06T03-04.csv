That's ""just another formal modeling tool"" and isn't particularly likely to lead to a revolution in programming of any sort anymore than any other formal modeling tool that formally models the ""same old"" programming techniques the author decries.<p>I was tempted to link <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Zippers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Zippers</a> , and now I guess I have, as another sort of ""thing that happens to share terminology with calculus"", but it is equally offtopic. Calculus here is metaphorically the same calculus that you looked ahead to when you were in middle school; a mysterious land where the impossible is trivial and full of strange concepts and funny squiggles. We are that middle schooler.<p>Really, though, it's fair to read this essay as ""Gosh, I sure wish a silver bullet existed"" and stretching only a bit further ""If only there were some way to get around the fact it takes great programmers to make great programs"". The silver bullet is that metaphorical calculus here, but it's a call for a silver bullet all the same. We can all nod in recognition of the desire, even as we are fairly sure nothing more will come of this than any other desire for the silver bullet.",1278388742

Those cultural normals are established through human connections: the night we all stayed late to get that release out the door, the day we celebrated our funding round or the day we landed our first big account.  The culture is forged through office parties, poker, paintball or film nights.

Soon after, Kurt Godel demonstrated that in any given formal system, consistency and completeness were mutually exclusive.<p>It seems to me that this had the same devastating impact on philosophy as Einstein's relativistic theorems did on classical mechanics and the popular acceptance of scientific determinism (please note I am not positing any scientific relationship between Godel's theorem and Einstein's work on relativity). Einstein apparently found quantum mechanics an equally alarming intellectual innovation.<p>So between incompleteness, relativity and QM, 20th century intellectuals were hit with a kind of triple whammy showing that our beliefs about logic, observation and causality were all inherently limited and that in many respects The Truth is fundamentally unknowable. Prior to this one could argue that philosophy as an intellectual pursuit was the foundation which underpinned all other kinds of academic endeavor, even if one felt privately disappointed about the prospects of finding any sort of ultimate truth or philosophical 'theory of everything'.<p>For every philosopher who could accept this with a shrug and move on to examining the limitations of critical thinking itself, there are probably 9 others that can't bring themselves to stand up and say plainly that there's not really anywhere else to go from here, and that their legacy is likely to be no more than another footnote to Plato.",1278387833

If you quit your job and start your own company, and fail, you'll be much better off than if you hadn't. If you go look for a new job, you will have <i>run your own company.</i> Would an employer rather hire someone who hasn't run their own company, or someone who has?""<p>Running your own company definitely brings with it valuable lessons. If I were to get a job today, I would have a completely new perspective on the concerns of my superiors, and what really matters in a company's day-to-day operations. Before working for myself, I didn't feel any motivation at my job because I often felt I could make better decisions than my superiors. If it came down to me needing to get a job, I would clearly know whether this was really true or not.",1278386665

(well obviously right lolz) require you to update almost all of your other peripheral oriented accessories. They have created an experience above an beyond all.

Go ahead.  The issue is whether we (can) classify <i>truth</i> as an essential quality of a statement, or as a description of a statement from a particular perspective.<p>To make an analogy that dawkins would surely crucify me for, it's like the difference between the notion of absolute time, and time as described by Einstein's relativity.  From a post-modernist view, time/truth is relative, but being relative doesn't mean it doesn't matter, and just as with physical time, there are narrow frames of reference (day to day life on Earth) where the relativity of time/text/truth is... irrelevant.<p>God, it really is impossible to advocate for post-modernism without writing in that multiple meaning style.",1278386457

When the price is right, I'm very happy to use a service like this, despite the DRM.  The user experience beats anything else out there, including going to the local mall and buying a game boxed.<p>The key is the price though.  With Steam games, I lose the ability to sell the game on after I'm finished it, and publishers of all kinds (music, movies, ebooks, videogames) need to understand that I'm not going to pay them the same (or more) for something that doesn't give me the same rights as the physical media.<p>The policy of certain publishers to charge considerably more for the same game in different regions (in my case Australia - see e.g. the price of Mass Effect 2 in Aus here: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/clwk1/steam_final_day_borderlands_sid_meiers/c0ti2lt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/clwk1/steam_final_da...</a>) is also something I'm not going to tolerate.  I didn't buy <i>any</i> of the games in the Steam sale that were priced higher in this country, so those publishers lost out.<p>I presume that this is due to the way publishing rights are apportioned internationally, and I've seen similar problems afflict other media (particularly ebooks, where the availability of a particular Kindle title varies a lot depending on whether you're in the UK, US or Aus).  Again, publishers need to understand that consumers really couldn't give a toss about this sort of thing: we just want to buy their product, not have to worry about some international publishing agreement bullshit.  If somebody can't buy something on Amazon/Steam/iTunes/whatever in their region, that's driving them towards the pirates, not towards the locally-published version.",1278385926

At any rate most of the original white settlers in the south, Georgia especially, were subjects of ""transportation"" and subject to seven years of indentured servitude, or were Scotts-Irish recruited to be frontier settlers. Only a relative handful of ruling-class whites could afford nannies. And those families, the Washingtons and Lees for instance, were descended from landed aristocracy back in England who were on the losing side of the English Civil War. Take away the minority plantation owning families and the average white household at best could afford one, maybe two slaves as full-time field hands. Still, west African dialects probably did make their mark on southern dialects.",1278385504

Simply leave the Mac Mini on all the time.  It becomes the stand alone device, satisfying point 1.  You can use the iLife suite and a few other programs (mostly free) to satisfy point 2.  It has a remote and has been satisfying all the other points except 4 and 9.  The Airport Express+HDMI thing would satisfy point 4.  (And Apple TV already does this, but it costs too much to get just for that function.)  Being able to mirror it in the cloud would give you point 9.
