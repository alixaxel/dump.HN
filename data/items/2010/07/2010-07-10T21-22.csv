Required acceleration?<p>Once you know this, then you'll know how much power is needed to move the object. At that time you can start searching motor databooks to find one that's suitable.<p>And then don't forget you'll want to figure out how precise the motion must be (how much overshoot/undershoot is permissible?) so you can start with the electronic/control system design.<p>Fun stuff!!!",1278799152

More often than not, it's uncommon just because we're doing it wrong.<p>I spent a good couple of years thinking up layout optimizations like the one in Figure 6. I think that's fairly common design style, when people choose to think about this stuff. The challenge is coming up with consistently better layouts for a specific application. One benefit of java, for example, is that you can move things around without worrying about pointer arithmetic like in C.<p>And his rant about Figure 7 resonates. Again, it's brain-dead obvious that you should take the memory hierarchy of your system into account because you waste millions of cycles waiting on a disk read, but it's really hard to do. Our education system doesn't help, and neither do mainstream tools.<p>I think of it as concentric revolutions. The pentium's algorithm for processing instructions out-of-order first showed up in a mainframe 30 years before (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasulo_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomasulo_algorithm</a>). The internet gradually rediscovers what desktop devs gradually rediscovered what the minicomputer devs originally dreamt up. Most of the time it's not common yet simply because people haven't gotten around to it.<p>It's basically YAGNI on the scale of industry segments. A successful startup will gradually make its infrastructure more stable and higher-performance after it's ensured it'll be around. And a successful new technology will first validate its reason for being before gradually trying to use what previous technologies have learned.<p>Sorry this is poorly written. I'm not sure what parts of this are non-obvious, so feel free to ask more questions.",1278799113

When you build a Google, you can tell me I am wrong.<p>Everyone I have spoken to that has built a successful company has told me that their ability to manage the long term interests of their company was impaired by losing control of their board of directors.<p>If Mark Zuckerberg did not have control of his board, the company would have been sold to Yahoo for just under a billion dollars, where Facebook would have died.  The Yahoo executives wanted to ""Nascar up the site"".  It would not be a 30 billion dollar dollar company today if the board had been investor controlled.<p>The reason Friedster failed was that the company was managed from the board of directors by investors which did not use their product.  The founders of Friendster were screaming at the board of directors that the website took 40 seconds to load, but the board was more concerned with expanding into new markets and adding features, rather than solving the scalability issues the company was facing.  Myspace copied Friendster, solved the scalability issues and dominated until Facebook introduced the feed and notification mechanism and took the college demographic.<p>If you want to build a long term success like Google, you have to be in a position to ignore your investor's short term desire to improve the company's financials by sacrificing long term growth.  The quickest way to increase your margins is to reduce investment in the future.<p>Most of Google's costs were from their consuming facing search product.  Almost all of Google's revenues were from enterprise search.  Dropping consumer facing search would have improved Google's financials for sale or IPO.  Everyone at the time believed that search engines were loss leaders for portal sites.  If the management team did not have board control, the decisions that would have been forced on the company would had led Google to a different, much grimmer corporate destiny.<p>The management team at Google believed strongly in the future of internet search and the growth of online advertising.  They saw the potential of using search queries to target advertisements and that search engines were uniquely positioned to monetize lead generation; at a time when search engines were loss leaders for portal sites.  If the company had cut its loss centers and focused on its profit centers, the company would not have been as successful as it is today.  The operating autonomy of Google's management team was critical to Google's long term success.<p>I do not care what Paul Buchheit says.  Eric Schmidt has on several occasions discussed the advantages of Google's ownership structure and how it enabled Google to ignore outside influences and focus on the long term success of the company.  If Paul Buchheit disagrees with the CEO of Google about the importance of Google's ownership structure and the operational autonomy of the management team, then its unfortunate.",1278798826

Bureaucracy - managers are on the hook for other people delivering things they may not understand and don't directly control, all while dealing with massive uncertainty.

You can't communicate over a profile what you can collaborating on a project, tutoring someone, or even playing WoW.</i><p>I think a helpful way to think about online dating sites is as just another class of venue, like a bar or whatever.  You wouldn't expect to completely know someone immediately after meeting them at a bar; rather, you're using a quick first impression to decide if you want to get to know them more.  After your first date, it doesn't matter much where you happened to meet.<p>Just as some people don't come across well in bars, others don't come across well in profiles.  Sure you can argue that the ""in person"" impression is worth more, but that's actually a bit dubious.  An online profile lets some types of people quickly demonstrate intelligence and personality in a way that some other venues don't necessarily allow.<p><i>So the elephant in the room, I think, is that dating isn't really a problem that needs solving via a web app.</i><p>Describing ""dating"" as a problem to be solved is akin to describing ""graph theory"" or ""linear algebra"" as a problem to be solved; you're being overbroad.  There's the ""life partner problem,"" the ""I want to get laid tonight problem,"" the ""summer fling problem,"" etc.  I think the problem online dating solves best is the ""introduction problem"" — how to efficiently meet people with whom you share a baseline romantic interest.<p><i>You can meet significant others in bars, art and yoga classes, the gym, ... on, and on, and on. .... As long as you do things which involve meeting new people, you'll probably run into people you like enough to date.</i><p>While I agree with this, I disagree with the conclusion that these venues obviate the need for online dating.  What happens if you live in a very small town?  What if you don't have time to go to bars, seminars, and yoga?  What if you're shy?  Online dating levels the playing field for people who are affected by questions like those.<p><i>Hell, I know a lot more couples who met playing WoW than I do who met using dating websites.</i><p>Dare I say, you are an outlier.<p><i>What's the point of isolating and controlling the meeting of mates, when it's such a natural byproduct of being social?</i><p>Maybe because it's more efficient?  What does ""being social"" mean in this context, anyway?  And why is going to a yoga class to meet a mate intrinsically superior to using an online dating site?<p>The girl I'm dating right now actually lived down the street from me for a while, but because I don't work with her, go to her gym, or take Irish class, I'd have been unlikely to have met her and gotten to know her without online dating.  Go figure.<p>Again, dating sites are just venues where you can meet people.  It seems to be more isolating and controlling to try to eliminate or deride them: why should there be one less type of venue where people can meet potential dates?<p>I think there are many people out there who could really benefit from online dating but demur from it because of the kind of thinking in the parent comment.",1278797586

1504373,comment,1503860,1503860,0,0,chime,,,"> The artificial horizon is a gyroscopically steadied line, which stays level with the earth's surface. The airplane pitches and banks in relation to this steady line, which in spatial terms never moves. Of course, in airplane terms it does move -- which presents a problem, because pilots are part of the airplane: they fly it from within, strapped to their seats. In clear skies they would never misjudge a bank as the tilting of the earth, but with their view restricted to the abstractions of the instrument panel they sometimes do just that: when the airplane banks, they perceive the motion as a movement of the artificial horizon line across the face of the instrument. This causes them to ""fly"" the wrong thing -- the moving horizon line, rather than the fixed symbolic airplane. For example, as turbulence tilts the airplane to the left, the pilots, tilting with it, notice the artificial horizon line dropping to the right. Reacting instinctively to the indication of motion, they sometimes try to raise the line as if it were a wing.<p>Would this be considered an example of a dangerously confusing user interface?",1278796977
