And thats my favorite thing about HN; if I ever have a question about something (that I read here or otherwise), I know that I can come and ask and get an answer. If you ever have any questions about something you read, I'd strongly encourage you to ask it as well.<p>Or in general, really. Not just on HN. Learning and asking questions isn't something that should be scary.<p>As for your three points:<p>1. Those are three useful languages to know. Especially Javascript. Don't be so quick to put down what you do know; someone else will <i>always</i> know more than you. Good for them. Ask them a question, learn something from them.<p>My personal belief is that you have to like what you do to be good at it. And people like to talk about things they like. So, don't be surprised if someone is willing to talk to you about your question :)<p>2. I don't mean to be harsh, but it sounds like the only thing stopping you from having a bunch of neat ideas to show off is, well, you. It sounds like you've <i>started</i> a few ideas. Why not <i>finish</i> them up as well?<p>A very good friend of mine is fond of saying (something along the lines of): ""If you pretend to be something long enough, you'll eventually find that you've become what you were pretending to be."" If you have 80% done (or even 50%), thats a start. Keep going and you'll wind up with something to show for it. Then you'll find that you've turned into one of those people that you aspired to be like.<p>3. Everyone had to start somewhere. Some people started earlier and others later. Some people can pick certain things up quicker than others. Thats no reason to be so harsh on yourself. And not everyone is working on the same idea.<p>And even within the same idea, there's always going to be plenty of room for multiple companies. YC has funded companies in the same area before. There's hundreds of Twitter clients out there. Don't ever let ""Well, someone else is doing this..."" stop you.",1279781992

Coming to HN can instantly humble anyone who previously believed (s)he is smart, talented, destined for greatness, etc. when you see what truly brilliant people are like. I know it gave me a good reality check and sense of my relative knowledge compared to all the potential things to learn.<p>But you've taken the wrong lessons out of it. Don't view it as a community of people better and smarter than you, see it as a wealth of knowledge like a library.<p>Don't view the people here as your competition. View them as people with something to teach you.<p>Intelligence is not a zero-sum game. No one will prevent your success because they are ""smarter"" than you. The more educated, energized, and ethical people in the world, the better for us all.

Eventually, I'm probably going to get funding, and sign into some kind of contract. Now the fact is, I'm no legal expert, and I don't have money to hire a legal expert from day one. The fact that the law makes some contracts unenforceable makes me feel much safer about not entering into any kind of mess that will seriously screw me.<p>Obviously, this only goes so far. And of course I <i>will</i> pay for actual legal counsel before entering a contract. But anything that society can do to make it easier to start a startup, including things like not having to worry about certain legalities, is a Good Thing, since it makes startups more likely.",1279781717

The way the OP presented the facts, the interpretation is that it's a derivative work. Someone took his text and shuffled it around just enough to make it not word for word identical. How the dice will roll in court is always tricky to say, and impossible in a case where you only have a general description of the facts, and only from one party at that.<p>The point is that a derivative work is protected just like the original.

1537536,comment,1536946,1537475,0,0,_delirium,,,"Most C libraries already implement those as both functions <i>and</i> macros. The macro definition usually shadows the function definition, but you can access the function version if you want, e.g. in glibc, getc() will call the macro, while (getc)() will call the function. The macro is just a wrapper for a function anyway in glibc (the internal _IO_getc), so there's no real reason to retain it except for historical reasons. If macros were eliminated in user code, you'd just use the function versions. I think having them as macros at all is an efficiency hack dating back to the days when compilers didn't do function inlining.",1279781591

(No, really, you won't go blind. )  Few people are going to claim it's generally readable to the uninitiated, but so what?  So is French, for a lot of people.  The thing is, if you think it would be useful, you learn it, and at that point the value of ""readable to people who haven't learned it"" goes to nil.<p>You could argue that some languages (maybe Haskell) maintain a level of inscrutability for a long time as you are learning; you continue to  spend too much time decoding text when you could be zipping along with some reads-just-like-English language.<p>But that's a different issue. ""Difficult to obtain proficiency"" is not the same as ""intelligible to outsiders"", and concerns different value to the programmer.    Plus, the cost of proficiency needs to be weighed against the return on effort.  (Consider Vim or Emacs.  Worth the effort to learn?  An awful lot of people seem to think so.)<p>It may take longer to become proficient in (say) Haskell than in Ruby, but the long term payoff may be that you become far more efficient, with your code being far more concise.<p>There's a difference between BASIC and Brainfuck, and some language comparisons are just apples and oranges, but the value of being easy or readable to newbies or outsiders is largely tied to the value of being a newbie or an outsider.  Once you are neither you really need your language to have other strengths.<p>(Which certainly Ruby has, and its those strengths people should use to sell it.)",1279779282

1537486,comment,1536946,1537423,0,0,tmsh,,,"These are really good points. I suppose the only problem I see is when the C modules develop their own hierarchy of types and then they have to interface with Python's hierarchy of types. That's really the only issue.<p>If what you're doing in C is numerical or computational in a functional way that doesn't need a hierarchy of types -- then keeping all your types in Python and calling into C for IO, computation, etc., makes a lot of sense.<p>Where I've run into problems is if the C modules themselves get sophisticated and start having scene graphs or hierarchies of shapes, etc. Because then it makes sense to mirror the hierarchy in Python -- but then you get real performance issues.<p>So I guess if you can ensure that your C modules have a clear functional interface (or at least one whose side effects are clearly defined) and doesn't involve anything but a shallow type hierarchy, then Python + C is all good for that. I.e., the C modules have to be very well-defined or have just about no 'code smell' (at least near their interface with Python). Arguably you can always do this if you make an effort to refactor your C modules. But yeah, because Python must always be at the root node, one is sort of constrained to serve the 'top', so to speak. And that may encourage a sort of top-down design which is less amenable to bottom-up programming (as mentioned in On Lisp), etc.",1279778651
