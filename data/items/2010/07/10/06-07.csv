It's limiting and buggy (last week we discovered a bug involving GIL and on-demand imports for constructing Unicode objects...it's hiding pretty well). However, if I were to judge it as a design decision and not as something I can ""fix"", I would seriously say I'm neutral about it.<p>Why? It's pretty simple: since the language doesn't have any acceptable way to provide concurrency with threads, I'm going OS on its ass. And so should you, ""complainers"" or not. The solution is probably not ideal, and it's cetrainly <i>A Bad Thing</i> to many of you, but Unix programming showed the way. That's right. We should be doing more of it (in this context). A lot more of this (again, in this specific context). I’m talking about fork(2), execve(2), pipe(2), socketpair(2), select(2), kill(2), sigaction(2), and so on and so forth. These are our friends. They want so badly just to help us.<p>Sure, it's not always nice. Typically, if you want to share a large amount of state, you'd have to do it manually, which would result in code not so pretty as the Python lovers usually write. That may be a disadvantage to them. This point is moot, because I remember my professors screaming to us to avoid shared state as much as possible when doing concurrent programming - if you need to do it, you should rethink your solution before you rethink your tools.<p>I've agreed with Brett on multiple occasions in the past about this; people seem to think that changing the way Python is implemented to encompass more and more of certain features <i>the way they like them</i> would somehow make the language more powerful and popular and all around awesome. That's not true. Most of the ""complainers"" are people that chose Python because of its power, not wanting to actually learn anything other than an API.

At our startup we are trying hard to reassure users we're not going to misuse the Facebook access they're giving us.  Even though we're asking for a fairly limited set of rights, the permissions screen that appears after the Facebook Graph login is quite intimidating.

See <a href=""http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/</a> for a screen shot.  It would be better if the screen were friendlier and less evocative of danger.<p>Another way to improve the user experience would be to consolidate the login form and permissions to a single screen.  Twitter's oauth login screen does this well.  Screen shot: <a href=""http://followfridayhelper.com/images/help-login-via-oauth.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://followfridayhelper.com/images/help-login-via-oauth.pn...</a><p>Additionally, the oauth tokens should be long-lasting by default.  We originally set up our site to not ask for an extended-life token, because we wanted to reassure users that we weren't going to be posting things on behalf when they weren't using the site.  But this ruined the user experience. A short time after logging in to our site, a user would initiate an action, but because their token had expired, we had to pop open a new Facebook login window, interrupting what they were doing.  Users were annoyed at having to constantly re-login to Facebook.  So we now ask for the extended life permission.  While this improves the user experience, it adds another intimidating message on the Facebook permissions screen, implying we're going to be posting on their behalf even when they don't initiate it.<p>Happy to chat more about what we're doing and give additional feedback.<p>Lee Semel",1278742827

Or they bill you afterwards with the full force of law behind their threats.  Very few will give you the service first and then ask nicely for money.<p>I'm hoping that it works out, simply because if it doesn't, I'd bet that we won't see very many businesses using this strategy in the future.

My opinion is that fold, otoh, is better limited to use with commutative and associative operators for clarity and transparent parallelization.
