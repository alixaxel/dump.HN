I can't count the number of times that I've posted a straightforward technical response, then downvoted, and said that my opinion is worthless unless I provide sources and that the commenter is a highly paid consultant so he knows what he is talking about.<p>For example, just about a month ago it looked like someone was confused about a basic systems issue. I posted with a quick comment about the nature of optimization in the memory hierarchy which featured a well-known result in standard CS literature. You know, there are times when I don't mind digging through IPDPS or the ACM for proper citations, but a lot of the time I resent the fact that the argumenter didn't even take the time to do some basic research about the topic.

Typically, you have a C++ driver that provides your application's main(), which invokes the Python interpreter, which can then call back into C libraries.  Or you might wrap that itself with a Python script.  That's the approach that the Tornado web server takes: a Python driver program, which enters an epoll select loop, which calls back into the Python to handle requests, which may themselves call functions written in C.  The point is that it's not just Python scripts calling super-fast C libraries, it's also often large C++ apps invoking Python scripts for lesser-used features.",1278732726

For example, in Canada, they only very recently (or will be soon, I can't recall for sure) lifted restrictions on caffeine in non-colas.  Previously, things like Mountain Dew, Sprite, 7-up, etc., could not contain caffeine.",1278730984

They want both to happen rather sooner than later due to the time value of money. They also believe that if they have more control they can achieve these first two objectives more effectively.<p>These investor goals are not always aligned with what's in the best interests of the product or company which is why it is sometimes a good thing for founders to retain control.",1278730969

I don't know how true that allegation is, but if it is true, and VCs had a larger slice of the pie, it's possible that that desire would have been followed, hugely reducing Google's value.",1278730863

I'm hoping the latter will hit Python 3.2.<p>All told, removing the GIL without throwing all of the C extensions and other work people have done through the years onto a bonfire is really, really hard. We're getting incremental speed improvements, and if we're lucky, unladen-swallow will allow us to jump ahead performance wise very quickly.<p>As a side note; I agree with you - threads have their place, many of my apps make heavy, heavy use of python threads. I also use multiprocessing when I know it's CPU bound. You have to know which is the right tool, and when.",1278730810
