Only developers will use PCs.<p>Also, don't underestimate the ""future factor"" when using an iPad.

Now a few months later, they're begging their users for donations.<p>il lays out exactly what they need to do, so there isn't much else to suggest. Simply set up some ad placements on the site and get set up as a publisher with the ad network of their choice. The network does all the sales. (Edit: Later on, they can get into do their own direct sales, sponsorships, etc.) They actually were signed up as a publisher for an ad network for a while, I think, because I remember some ad taking over the screen and everyone freaking out. Maybe that scared them away from the idea because they couldn't control the ad types, I don't know.<p>I don't know what their mobile numbers are, but they need to get set up as a publisher with a mobile ad network too, such as Ad Mob, Millennial or Quattro.<p>And since they don't know how anything works, they need to get a few thousand dollars and hire a consultant to explain it all to them. I know they are sensitive about pissing off users, but I suspect that their conversations with Conde Nast and any ad network have ended up in frustrated conversations that go nowhere because they don't understand each other.

For example, the book instructs you to define the main function like:<p><pre><code>    main(){\n      /* ... */\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis is considered bad code style for todays standards. It doesn't state the return value (it defaults to int) and it leaves the argument list open (you can pass any number of arguments to the function).<p>In other places, it puts restrictions that are no longer relevant today. For example, since C99 (and most compilers allowed this long before C99) you can declare variables anywhere inside a block (which is pretty handy), and not just at the beginning of the function.",1278786921

1504115,comment,1503999,1503999,0,0,arebop,,,"The real world is a varied place, and monster.com is not a uniform sample in my experience. One thing you'll find in the real world is corporate IT programming. This slice is well-represented on monster. You'll probably not have a shot at those jobs without a college degree; you can intern in those places with junior standing or so. Corporate IT jobs are mostly about simulating paperwork in computer systems to reduce handling costs. Java, C#, and VB.NET are popular languages.<p>Another slice of the real world is full of tech companies. Again, big companies will demand credentials. They will care more that your major is actually relevant and that you graduated from the right school compared to a non-tech company. But, tech companies are better able to discern actual skill and talent than non-tech companies. So, particularly in small tech companies, they won't actually require formal credentials if it's clear that you'll perform well. Tech companies by definition have to innovate to survive, so they're about solving all sorts of problems that haven't been satisfactorily solved before. C++ and Java are popular languages, but there's more diversity here than in IT.<p>There are lots of small businesses that need software for something. They will often advertise one-off projects and wind up using coders from low-wage countries. There are lots of terrible programmers working for low prices, but if you don't care about making money you could compete with them for coding jobs just to get the experience. In the real world, there's a lot of terrible code whose owners need bug fixes and new features. There are also many terrible coders who promise the world and work for rock-bottom prices. So all around, that could be an eye-opening experience.<p>""The real world"" is often used in contrast to academia, but it's silly to deny the legitimacy or practical benefit of basic research. There are university and commercial labs where researchers do really imaginative thinking and lots of experimental work to develop new programming languages or techniques. These places normally require advanced degrees and plenty of evidence of your brilliance and ability to convince other people that your ideas are interesting. They write a lot of math and prose and demos or experiments, but normally someone else turns the most promising ideas into mass-market products. Researchers don't care so much about maintainability, so they often favor languages that provide individual power (think lisp) over group safety (java). They are a well-educated and smart group, so they don't fear coq or haskell. C++ is pretty popular in certain circles, but generally this group cares least about agreeing to use any particular language.<p>I suggest you find a free software project that makes software you personally enjoy using, and contribute to that. You can start today, without formal credentials. Hopefully, you can find such a project whose members care about mentoring! Maybe <a href=""http://code.google.com/soc/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/soc/</a> is a good place to start looking. Anyway, you can learn plenty about the reality of software engineering by studying a free software project. Learn the language they use, read their design documentation to see what they think the most important properties and relationships in the codebase are, see how they manage bug reports and feature requests, etc.",1278786817

Others, can't open a bank account because we lack _any_ documentation that is not expired. Our consulates are refusing to renew anything. Others, yet again, are stateless individuals and don't have a consulate period. Dream Act students often fall into these categories because they were brought here at a very young age.<p>There is plenty preventing immigrants from going to college. Tax payers are not subsidizing anything, because undocumented students cannot apply for any federal loans or financial aid. If you are undocumented and go to college, you pay out of pocket, period. There are only a handful of private merit based scholarship that are available to undocumented students. I'm one of the lucky ones.<p>Out of state tuition argument is moot and I'm tired of the misinformation around the issue. There are only 10 states that have legislation that allows undocumented students to be eligible for in-state tuition BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE BEEN A RESIDENT OF THE STATE FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS AND GRADUATED FROM A STATE HIGH SCHOOL. I've lived in New York State for over ten years, and my parents have payed taxes into the states treasury every single year. I am a New Yorker and the in-state tuition law recognizes that for purposes of tuition. So ""Americans have to pay out of state tuition while undocumented immigrants can pay in-state tuition."" is complete bull shit. Residents of the state pay in-state, out of state students pay out of state, undocumented or not. Fair and square, and available only 10 states.<p>You simply don't want to recognize that I am an American and a human being.

It's not exactly asking for HTML to be modified so you can write signal processing code in it.<p>The sad thing is that a Python + C combination would actually be _more_ suitable for the task than any of the JVM based language implementations, because the JVM has the unfortunate feature of eating memory like crazy due to the lack of structured value types.<p>This type of application is all about conserving memory. The core data structures must be extremely tight. But they make up only like 5% of the code.

1504067,comment,1503789,1504046,0,0,ComputerGuru,,,"Way cheaper.<p>And controlling it with an arduino is no problem. You've got to main options for the sensor - either an optical tracker that is pointed at the shaft and detects the presence of a striped/marked point which appears once every revolution, or the (cheaper but just as reliable, really) solution of an iR sender/receiver pair monitoring the turning of something (imagine a motor shaft turning a fan. The iR pair would be positioned perpendicular to the fan blades, each time a blade crosses the path of the iR, a signal is generated).<p>iR is cheaper.<p>An arduino (or just about any other microcontroller) has an operating frequency way over the rotational speed of the motor. Both optical and iR sensors can easily handle the relatively-slow rotational speed of the shaft. I've used an MC68k from, what, 20 or 30 year old production lines(?) to pull this off. The code is dead simple, just connect the iR/optical output to a counter (which comes built-in in several of the arduino input ports) (you'll need to run it through an inverter first, if you're doing the iR approach) and then loop over the count until it's moved as far as you need it to.<p>The human hand isn't crazy fast the way you're thinking. If you've ever seen a stepper motor snap from one position to another, <i>that</i> is real acceleration. Basic DC motors typically have lower acceleration than that - their acceleration and speed will vary greatly depending on the model chosen.<p>2KG is <i>not</i> a light weight. I would have recommended the stepper approach, but you'll need motors about the size of your fist running at 12V and a relatively high current to rotate an object of that size. Basic statics says that the farther away from the point of rotation a weight is applied, the stronger its force. You've got 2KG distributed (I assume) evenly across the 30cm surface, it's going to be quite the weight to turn against gravity, so stepper motors are out.<p>Servos, which are basically your run-of-the-mill DC motors with their own close-lood feedback system will work. But you'll have better luck with the larger variety of DC motors available online or in your local electronics store.",1278785278
1504066,comment,1503850,1503850,0,0,lkrubner,,,"I recently spent a week in Berlin. I was impressed with the fact that civil rights are taken seriously there. I am from the USA, and I am aware that civil liberties have eroded in recent years. In the USA, of course, there were fears of terrorism that lead to the deterioration of civil rights. In Germany, when I visited various history museums, I was struck by the number of times that fears of terrorism had been invoked to limit civil rights in that country. In the 1800s, the early labor unions had many ugly confrontations with authorities, and the attempts of the workers to seek redress of grievances was often described by  the authorities as unlawful attempts to end the social peace. The German government took oppressive measures against the workers, on the grounds that such measures were necessary to maintain order.<p>Of course, today, labor unions are accepted as a normal part of the life of Germany, their actions are at times very aggressive, and yet civil order continues to prevail in Germany. In fact, Germany has one of the lowest crime rates of the Western democracies. So, what I learned (again) was that the social order can be maintained even when groups are allowed to assemble and take aggressive actions towards the maintenance of their interests. In fact, it seems to me there is some cause and effect there - the societies that show the most concern about civil rights seem to have very low crime rates.<p>I can not easily say why authoritarian methods backfire, but they seem to do so often. Most Latin American countries have followed authoritarian policies towards their people, and especially against the drug trade, yet those countries remain beset with high levels of crime. I would suspect that authoritarian regimes are vulnerable to high levels of corruption - if it becomes difficult for citizens to criticize the government, then how can police officials be kept honest? If a person who reveals government corruption can be accused of giving aid and information to the terrorists, then how can government corruption be exposed? And if the police can arrest people without cause, then surely they will find it easier and safer to make a living shaking down innocent citizens, rather than going against well-armed drug criminals. The ability of citizens to push back against unlawful arrest really needs to be the starting point of any system of civil rights. Otherwise, what do civil rights really mean? If you had the assurance of a fair trial, but police were free to arrest you without cause, or with only the slightest pretext of cause, then the police could cause you very serious harassment, though those in authority could defend the legitimacy of their actions by saying, simply, ""You are getting a fair trial, so why do you complain about your arrest?"" But of course, the arrest itself can be used as a form of harassment, a point that has been obvious to authoritarian regimes everywhere.<p>While in Berlin I was astonished by the lack of crime. I live in New York City, which has gotten steadily safer since 1993. I have memories of New York City in the 1990s, and so now, in 2010, I am often surprised at how safe New York is. But Berlin is in a whole separate category of safe. I would walk through supposedly bad neighborhoods, alone, at 3 AM and never have the slightest worry. The bad neighborhoods in Berlin are much like the good neighborhoods in New York.<p>I would encourage my fellow citizens, in the USA, to visit some of those nations with very strong protections of civil rights. I would especially suggest a visit to Berlin, as it is a wonderful city, and something of a revelation in terms of crime.<p>Though the USA has traditionally called itself ""The land of the free"" I think a fair and objective comparison of the various Western Democracies, in 2010, does not lead to flattering conclusions about the USA.",1278785257
