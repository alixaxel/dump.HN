Memory is a funny thing.<p>Memories are malleable when they're active -- when the event has just happened, and each time it's recalled thereafter. They can be expanded or changed if new information is prevented, especially when it comes authority figures... such as alternate theories from parents in denial that their little girl could be so careless. Each time a memory is recalled is an opportunity for it to change, and surely she remembered it many many times over those three months.<p>Another thing is that as memories change, they tend to become more ordinary ('schematic', in psychology lingo). Dropping your cell phone and plowing into a car is not a normal thing, but people get cut off all the time. It's easy to imagine something like that happening, so it's natural that the memory would change to fit a scenario like that.<p>It's not directly related, but to give you an idea of how radically memories can be changed, this is a video talking about a study where they created a memory from scratch.

They want Apple to rush out a design change and apparently skip all the testing (durability, RF considerations) while claiming the lack of testing caused the original problem. I would guess durability is a bigger concern than RF. The outer edge of the phone gets the most abuse. A thin non-conductive coating could chip or wear in an unpleasant way. The bumper case is a good enough solution for now. The only other alternative is to stop selling the iPhone for 2-3 months or however long it takes to make a design change and produce enough units to do a recall.

I was defending the use of `unsafePerformIO` as a non-'hack', and perhaps I misunderstood you to be thinking otherwise.  The memocombinators library uses Array, which uses `unsafePerformIO` and friends almost 700 times in one module. MemTrie takes a different approach, one not using unsafePerformIO; maybe I wasn't clear that was my meaning. In any case, there is little need for a library, at least for the simplest idea of memoization (the ugly Reddit discussion suggests there are many things to be meant.)  It is just a case of writing down what is meant, as happens a few times in slightly different ways on the reddit page, off the top of peoples' heads.  So for example this one:<p><pre><code>    memo :: Eq k => (k -> v) -> k -> v
    memo f = unsafePerformIO $ do
      ref <- newIORef [] :: IO (IORef [(k,v)])  -- make a page for a table
      return $ \k -> unsafePerformIO $ do       -- when f is applied to k
        memotable <- readIORef ref              -- get out the table
        case lookup k memotable of              -- see if k has been done
          Just x -> return x                    -- if it has, we're done!
          Nothing -> do                         -- if it hasn't
            let a = f k                         -- calculate f k
            atomicModifyIORef ref $ \t -> ((k,a):t,()) -- add it to the table before
            return a                            -- returning f k
