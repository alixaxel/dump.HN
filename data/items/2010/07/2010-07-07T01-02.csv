I have an interest in browsers and browser technology, but I don't develop any of them, no. That doesn't mean I am not allowed to discuss them, however.<p><pre><code>  > Ok, if you want to know all the features ...</code></pre>
Please don't mistake me here. I am not at all trying to slight or belittle Firefox 4. As I dig into it, I think it has a great feature set, and I'm excited to see it come out. My question was <i>specifically</i> about the features chosen for the spotlight page.<p>Now, back to the discussion.<p>WebM: You are correct, Chrome 5 does not support WebM, although it is in the dev version of Chrome 6. I do think, however, that the perception of the feature is it was Google's first, considering its their codec.<p>WebSockets: Please don't try to pretend Chrome is ignoring the standards changes. The new version is in Chrome 6 for you to try, if you're interested. My point is that this is a feature they drove to market, and got everyone else to support, hence my perception of it.<p>IndexedDB: Again, the specific technology is beside the point. Google has been pushing for offline storage since Gears, and now everyone else is implementing it (albeit a slightly different backend). You see where I'm going with this.<p>Crash Protection: I stand corrected. I always think of Chrome being the browser pushing the segregated processes, better plugin separation, etc, but it appears IE8 was first. Still, Firefox is definitely not leading the market on this one.<p>JetPack: as per aboodman, I will call this a wash.<p>WebConsole: It is a bit specious to give Firefox credit for a 3rd party extension (FireBug), but regardless, this feature doesn't support my point, and I never pretended it did.<p>HTML5/CSS3: Every browser coming out has been touting these two technologies for ages, most of the time without a clear consensus on what they even entailed. At this point you couldn't <i>not</i> put them on a feature list. So I don't particularly consider it valuable or surprising to see them.",1278466368

I usually suggest people take one of two paths:<p>1) Startup work -  This means a genuine interest in learning and doing outside of the classroom because it's dependent on what you've done and what you can do.  You have to adapt to changing technologies, but the work (imo) is more interesting and the degree requirements can be substituted for the right combination of enthusiasm, personalily and experience.<p>2) The corporate route - will require a degree to get past the HR department unless you have a foot in the door.  You'll work 9 - 5, be done at the end of the day and will likely have a secure job in either a legacy language or a current language that may become legacy.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with this route and I encourage most people to take it.  You do your best in school and use all available opportunities (summer work, coops, internships, etc.) and network your way into a likely fantastic company.<p>To differentiate I test most people to pick a project or field they have an interest in and we brainstorm an idea.  If they can do it, finish it, and write about or open source it and they're still interested, I highly recommend the startup/aternative routes.  If not, no harm no foul, but you're likely better suited for a corporate job.<p>I think both are equally valid and good, but different people need to do different things, which is why high school is so boring for a lot of people in the first place.",1278465422

I probably got punished for that later.<p>At the time I didn't understand why the lifeguard rescued me.
