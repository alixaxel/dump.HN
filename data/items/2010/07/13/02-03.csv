1510177,comment,1509870,1510115,0,0,jerf,,,"Further: SQL is not composable. If I have a fragment of SQL in my hand, there is no reasonable way to insert that into a larger expression. You can further tell this is a problem by the way any nontrivial SQL function degenerates into an enormous hellstorm of SQL that any Haskell programmer will see as full of redundancy. This is because SQL is almost immune to abstraction. (I have to specify the ""Haskell programmer"" bit because of the characteristics of this sort of language is that working in it directly for a long time causes you to think natively in that language and thereby miss the opportunities for abstraction that you <i>no longer see</i>. FWIW, Erlang also bothers me this way.) Yes, the ""bad programmer"" issue is in play too, but as a good programmer who has tried to write good stored procedures and has experience in numerous other languages I can not help but notice how much SQL <i>fights</i> me on this front.<p>SQL is very difficult to debug in general, which combines rather poorly with the previous characteristic. Perhaps there are nonstandard extensions in Oracle that make it easier but there's nothing I know of in the core language.<p>SQL has fooled people into thinking it is equivalent to the Relational Model, when in fact as kunley points out elsewhere it is merely <i>inspired</i> by it.<p>SQL dates from the 1970s and <i>it shows</i>. There are syntax quirks around every corner. The behavior of NULL is sensible, but it is merely one of several sensible choices and there are reasons why the SQL choice is not the one that has ""won"". Why is ""value IN ()"" a <i>syntax error</i>? It's perfectly reasonable. What's with the syntactic drama around subselects, which ought to be a core part of the better language that we really ought to be using? (A language in which the equivalent is probably going to be so simple we won't even believe people had a special syntax for it.) What's with the rigid specification of the order of GROUP BY and ORDER BY and everything else, when those should simply be instances of some sort of combinator that applies in order, in a sensible manner. Why is SELECT used both for data queries and aggregate queries when in fact the two operations are so different they should have entirely different keywords? Why is it so hard to mix an aggregate and non-aggregate query together when it's obvious to me exactly what I want?<p>Why can't my columns contain tables themselves, recursively? The fact that there are databases that can do this proves it's not impossible.<p>SQL needs to be replaced by a combinator-based language that backs to a richer data store that is more sensible, both from a relational model point of view and from a recursive point of view. LINQ points the way, but still is hobbled by LINQ-to-SQL being the flagship LINQ product. (And I don't think it's complete as-is.)",1278988655

1510142,comment,1509150,1509150,0,0,bdickason,,,"Disclaimer: I'm going to speak about 'premium' ad sales. That means more or less fortune 500+ companies. This is my area of expertise so I won't speak to other types of sales.<p>I work for an ad network and have seen sites around your size flounder trying to do direct sales. Granted, there are a few (ala 100layercake.com) that are extremely focused on a very profitable genre (in their case: weddings). However, you're much better off bridging the gap in the short term.<p>Sign up for an ad network.<p>Figure out what your audience is like. How old? Male/female? Tech savvy?<p>Then go out and find a 'premium' network to fit your demo. For example, I work for Giantrealm.com and we serve 12-34 yr old males (our sweet spot is 18-34). We focus on Gaming/Entertainment/Lifestyle. Your blog would be a ... lifestyle blog I guess? If you're struggling with categorization, try thinking how you would be described by TV Guide. Lame, I know.<p>I've seen tons of sites try to get off google and go straight to direct sales. 99% of the time they fail because they aren't big enough to be on advertisers' radar.<p>Google CPM's (cost per thousand ad impressions): About $1.00 on a good day.<p>'Remnant' CPM's: $1.50-2.00<p>'Premium' CPM's: $4.00-12.00 depending on the unit and setup.<p>note: these prices are AFTER the standard 50/50 split with your ad network.<p>Although direct sales will make you more money in the long term, you have a number of items going against you by selling direct:<p>First and foremost, most advertisers won't blink an eye unless you're over 1,000,000 US unique visitors (the unit most advertisers think in). You can check this by looking at the separate box called 'Unique Visitors' on the Google Analytics dashboard and then segmenting by US.<p>Second: Advertisers usually work with an ad agency who takes care of most of the buying. Ad agencies are usually staffed by 'junior' account execs which are 20-24 yr old females (sorry to stereotype) that generally don't browse the internet beyond Facebook. They usually have no idea that your site exists and like to buy things they understand. They definitely don't understand your site. They don't understand most of our sites. It's the problem we face with 'niche' content that doesn't focus around Twilight video reviews and Lindsay Lohan paparazzi shots.<p>Third: Ad Agencies rely on an antiquated tool called Comscore. Comscore is like a database of nearly every site online and how big they are. Unfortunately, they rely mostly (this is changing nowadays) on panel-based metrics, which means that they call people on the phone, ask them if they would like to take an 'internet survey,' and then have them install a plugin on their machine to do so. You can imagine that most of your viewers probably won't be up for this. Most of our sites show up at 1/10th of their size on comscore. For example Gameriot.com, a site I worked on for a year, showed 800k unique visitors in Google Analytics. It showed up as 30k, 80k, 450k, then didn't show up. These are 4 consecutive months. I would try to find a friend to see if you show up.<p>Fourth: Advertising is alot of work. If you want to enter the true 'ad industry, you need to get used to what are called RFP cycles. Advertisers send out things called 'RFP's (Requests for Proposals) every few weeks that require you to do a TON of work (build a powerpoint deck that sums up your 'pitch') and fill out an excel spreadsheet in terms of 'media dollars' which is a convoluted way of saying ""convert all dollars into banners, break it out by page, then give me a bunch of free stuff because I'm an advertiser and everyone else does.""<p>Fifth: Advertising is all about connections. There's a reason that most sales people are given salaries that are directly based on their number of contacts. If you don't know anyone, you're going to have a hard time getting meetings. There are rumors about people buying football tickets, strippers, etc... No comment.<p>Ad Networks will go out and sell your site 'directly' (good ones at least) and pitch custom plans that your audience wil be excited about. Granted, sometimes they sell a load of shit and everybody hates it, but the best sales people sell campaigns that the site loves so users write positively about the brand.<p>The Ad Network model is to 'rep' a site 50/50 until the site becomes big enough (traffic-wise) to sell direct. At that point, they will offer you large sums of money NOT to sell direct :)<p>You'll also have a great idea of what sells on your site, what ads do well (use their campaign monitoring tools to see which advertisers keep buying you and what the click through rates are), so you'll be educated once you do start buying direct :)<p>Finally, if read all that and REALLY don't want to sign up for an ad network, you might try signing up for Google Ad Manager (Google's free ad server) and dabbling in ad exchanges. They use real-time engines to allow advertisers to bid against each other on your inventory. You can see rates of $2-6 this way if your site is popular.<p>If you have any questions about what ad units you should run (728x90, 300x250), how you should pitch your site, how ad servers work, or which ad networks to reach out to, I'm happy to help.

For some reason, we decided to connect the metal parts (don't remember if there was a motor attached) to a nightlight (we moved the bulb). There was a spark and the house went dark. I quickly said goodbye to my friend's parents and learned the next day that we had managed to make the entire suburban block go dark. The teachers at our school heard about it. To be honest, I felt it gave me some sort of notoriety.<p>But in retrospect it was a really stupid WTF episode. I think my parents didn't let me play with him much\nafterwards. I should try to look him up on Facebook. He probably won't remember or will claim not to remember. Stupid childhood mistakes that you survive.

I had also been preparing for 6 months to pass a very hard networking certification (CCIE), when my boss decided that he could hire a cheaper engineer and fired me.  I had no idea what to do next but I had lots of free time on my hands. So, when my gf, who was into handmade crafts, asked me to set up a wordpress blog for her, I immediately decided to help her (even though I knew nothing of HTML or web development) because my self-confidence was going down in a spiral to the ground.<p>The blog made $500 in the first month from Adsense. A year later, close to $1000 a month. I created a few more websites around the same concept and now I make close to $2500 a month in passive income, which allowed me to spend a year studying Python full time (and web development in general) and also lets me work full time on my startup. I'm not rich, but I make my own time, work on my own projects and it's a nice sum of money for someone living in Brazil.",1278986988

That's the conclusion that was drawn by researchers at Harvard from many postmortems of companies who tried (occasionally successfully) to create spinoffs to address disruptive innovation.  Their strongest finding was how over-funding the spinoff killed it.<p>The key problem is that if you've been given $10 million by investors, you're going to be unable to go after a $5 million opportunity that you find.  By contrast if you've bootstrapped up from $100,000, that same $5 million opportunity is very tempting.<p>It is in the nature of disruptive innovation that those $5 million opportunities tend to grow over time.  But by the time they do that, it is too late for the over-funded startup.<p>Back in the startup world, when you start you have no idea what your potential market is.  At the beginning you're generally wrong about <i>what</i> the market is.  You generally can't even judge to within an order of magnitude.  However if, along the way, you find it clearly enough defined that success becomes about acquiring large numbers of customers on a fairly well defined value proposition, then you're in a great position to go look for funding.  And if, along the way, you find a comfortable business that makes you happy, you have the freedom to go after it without having to justify to anyone why you're not going to generate decent returns on a large investment.",1278986658
