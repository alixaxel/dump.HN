(This must be a little awkward in reading pages of mixed text, surely?) Nomura found that meaning was extracted faster from kanji than kana words, and thought that kana pronunciation was data-driven and that kanji pronunciation was conceptually-driven. Morton &  Sasanuma (1982) also claimed that evidence supports the intuitive belief that kanji can give direct access to the meaning of words, but that kana always require translation into a phonological code when they are being read, and there is no development of automatic visual recognition of the kana symbols.""<p>I believe Japanese uses the ideographic kanji for nouns, plus some adjectival and verbal roots, and the phonological kana for the rest, e.g. grammar words. In English, these same words classes (nouns, adjectives, inluding adverbs ending in -ly, and mosts verbs, except the most common ones) are the words we stress when speaking. Is this the same principle at work in both Japanese and English, where the content words of a language are stressed and easier to remember semantically, and the grammar words and morphological inflections are unstressed and easier to remember phonologically?<p>Is this also why in written German, the nouns are capitalized (as was Dutch until 50yrs ago and English until a few hundred years ago), because it helps if they stand out?",1279014978

If your database has no schema, any mistakes you make can accumulate subtle damage to the integrity of your data that you don't have any way of going back and fixing. I saw this happen in a Notes shop. Over time, some of the documents had been updated by many different versions of the code, until they were in such bizarre and unintended states that not even the developers could say what the correct app behavior should be anymore.<p>If you are not migrating your data to your current schema, it will decay to garbage. If you are, you already have the old and new schema in your mind, so why not write them down and get some help from the tools?<p>The other way out is to keep the authoritative version of your data in a store with a schema, and maintain a summary of it in your low-latency store that you can regenerate at need.",1279014871

1510860,comment,1510709,1510792,0,0,Kliment,,,"Watching 30fps stereo on a DLP projector running at 60hz is a pleasure. It's not so much the framerate as the fact that an LCD screen does not update the entire image at once, but scans through it one line at a time. This way you don't have a single time point where the entire image is just left or just right. Updating the entire screen at once, at 120fps, is what 3d televisions (and DLP projectors) do, in addition to providing an external sync trigger signal for shutter glasses to latch onto. That is what makes a display device 3d compatible, not the frame rate in itself.<p>That said, if you have a high enough framerate on an LCD you can simulate the global screen change effect by just showing each frame longer, for example running a 120hz screen at 30fps stereo (60 fps total), and showing each frame twice, giving the screen time to update.",1279013798

But after the favourite scored a goal, the odds for draw moved up (since it is now less likely that the game ends in a draw). So no matter what will be the result, you win (it's exactly the same principle as with stock trading or forex, where you sell when the price is high or buy when the price is low).<p>Of course, it might happen that as the match going on, the draw is more and more likely, so the odds for a draw is getting lower. Then at some time, the trader can still bet on a draw (like in the first example), but this time he will have a loss, but a lot lower loss as if he would place just only one bet and lost.
