In general I still think most apps probably need some kind of relational database (and generally I consider a relational DB a nice hedge against changing requirements), but I'm also spending quite a bit of time on optimizing my own app and it's amazing how certain alternative data stores offer primitives to billiantly pick off real world bottlenecks cropping up in a traditional SQL DB.<p>So for me the best way to approach it has been by looking through the prism of real world problems.",1279608684
1531369,comment,1531004,1531188,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"DCF is a really problematic thing. I completely understand where you're coming from and we've had people close to us under false investigation from family services and it's a pretty bad gig. They act like everything you say is such an absurd lie and that you're just waiting for them to walk away so that you can start slamming your children into the floor again. It is really sad that they can't use common sense.<p>But at the same time, we've had people close to us exhibit a constant pattern of abuse with their children, including using and dealing hard drugs with the children present and leaving things like syringes lying around. We called DCFS and the investigation, as far as I know, has gone nowhere.<p>The woman still has her children because every time the agents show she happens not to have anything particularly incriminating in plain sight. The woman is a serial liar and manipulator and uses people wherever she can. She has many medical problems incidental of her drug use and the way she has treated her body and uses them to her benefit, playing the persecution card. We believe that she is constantly on the edge of sanity and has issues with schizophrenia. She is regularly beaten by her partners, and the children see this.  She is always cracked out on legal prescription drugs, which she has a valid prescription to use, because as above, she has abused her body for years and now has serious problems as a result.<p>Her son has a disability that requires special attention. If he gets injured, he must be administered a booster immediately or he may die. This child is frequently unsupervised while his mother sleeps until 2pm and he runs around outside with kids who don't speak English, jumping off of balconies and stuff. He frequently misses school for a week or so at a time (she makes sure he appears at least once every 10 days, because the school people don't file a report until 10 consecutive absences). But apparently DCFS can't do anything unless they happen to appear at a time when the mother has drugs in reach or sight of the children, and the story is that heretofore they haven't seen this.<p>I sympathize that it sucks to be falsely investigated, but if you consider that there are people like those described above, who have become expert manipulators and liars to conceal and feed their habits, and DCFS has to investigate them too, you can understand some skepticism on the part of the agents.<p>Either way, it's a pretty horrible system. I don't really know the answer, but the current setup obviously doesn't work; this woman still has custody of her children six months later (the last time we had contact with them, her boyfriend, who speaks almost no English, called to say that the woman had been away for two days and asked us to take the children so he could go to work) and innocent people get harassed for years because of pettiness and retaliatory reports. Someone should try to fix this, though obviously it's a pretty intractable problem.",1279608680

Would you agree with that?<p>Some people don't think it's normal to want to photograph children naked. Others do. Some may not think it's abnormal, but on the other hand think it is not wise. Clearly, you think it's okay to do. Or you just think it is not unwise, or should not be banned. Those are each distinct nuanced states of mind on the matter. That's fine.<p>I don't see where all this ""being terrified"" angle is coming from actually. I guess I have a different understanding of the word terror and terrifying.<p>Having an awareness of the state of one's society is a useful thing. To be aware of possibilities, and make choices accordingly I'd argue is a smart thing. It's not being fucked up, it's being wise and pragmatic. As was shown in the OA, in theory everybody is innocent until proven guilty. But in practice, especially regarding this particular issue, it's effectively the opposite. Clearly we want to change that. But the world is not like that at the moment. Should we try to make it better? Yes. Can we make it better? Possibly not. Should we do the wisest thing in the meantime? You'll probably have a happier life if you do, but it is up to you whether the tradeoff is worth it. From my perspective, there's almost no upside and therefore no tradeoff to consider. YMMV. But do not be ""terrified"" of my position. Be terrified of a giant flying shark in the night or something. But not something like this. :P",1279607811

This is not an invocation of Godwin's law, but the closest possible analogy, as these bureaucrats make the exact same repugnant decisions someone like Eichmann made. They fully well <i>know</i> they ruin the lives of many innocent folks; at least half the cases turn out to have been nothing. The problem is not 'the government' or 'society'. The problem is our neighbors: citizens like you and me, not realizing they have to question what they do in the light of each individual situation, not thinking for themselves or not having the moral fiber to act according to those thoughts.<p>These horror stories are not solely an American problem: there are plenty of similar European stories. However, the American stories are by far more extreme, as both the punishment and the immediate social consequences are worse. Not only the bureaucrats are like concentration camp guards: the teachers that immediately distrust you and the neighbors that won't let their kid play with yours anymore are equally guilty of 'guilty until proven innocent'.",1279606265

No company can consistently outdo its own hype, let alone Apple; while the new phone/OS has proved anticlimactic (especially after the great launch of the iPad), it's hardly a disaster. The only end I see is to their having the smartphone market largely to themselves. They'll lose a bit of market share over the next year, between increased competition and an indifferent response to the new iPhone.<p>The biggest challenge I see in the immediate term is how to differentiate their next offering from the competition. Of course they can further reduce size and weight, but this is an area of diminishing returns. The current generation of smartphones are not much more bulky than a wallet, which is Small Enough for most people. Speed is kind of limited by the quality of the carrier, so I think the next gen fight will be all about battery life.",1279606258

Not to defend Apple, but before the iPhone, you had to buy an entirely new phone in order to get the latest OS. I think it's incredibly impressive that I can ""upgrade"" the iOS on my phone to a new whole number release. Twice!
