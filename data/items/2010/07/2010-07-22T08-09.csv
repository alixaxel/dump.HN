The first has been mentioned — slurping data from the local address book and feeding it to any site.<p>The second I can't test, but looking at the screenshot, it appears that Safari actually fills in the text field with the contents of the auto-fill, before you actually choose that auto-fill, and it highlights that text so typing something overwrites it, which is a standard way of doing autofill. However, using script to ask the textbox for its contents then exposes sensitive data. In contrast, other browsers display the sensitive data in (inaccessible to script) browser chrome, so no data is exposed.<p><pre><code>  Safari:    R|*obin Message* (in the textbox itself)

1537700,comment,1536946,1536946,0,0,phaedrus,,,"1.  Instead of the ability to directly call and be called by C/C++, include a really kick-ass Foreign Function Interface that can JIT the hookups and wrappers.  And more important than <i>call</i> compatibility IMO is C++ object ABI compatibility.  (I realize there is no universal C++ ABI; just pick one and be compatible with it.) If you can declare a struct or class in the language and make its layout match a C or C++ class/struct to the point of being able to pass them back and forth, that's the important feature.  The other important thing is some C API's use callback functions, without passing a user object that you can use to implement a closure out of it.  A language with the ability to dynamically emit new functions (built in JIT) would be able to build a new C function just for one object to receive a callback.<p>2. Fuck the C preprocesser.  An architecture based on #include files is a joke; you will never make something better than C++ if you stick with that compilation model, you'll only make another C++ (corollary to the phrase, those who don't understand Unix are doomed to re-implement it poorly).  Here's an idea:  sandbox the god damn shit preprocessor and parse its output to provide input to the FFI (foreign function interface) JIT compiler.  Under no circumstances allow macros defined in an #include to spill into the language proper.  <i>This</i> is not negotiable.<p>3.  No, mark-sweep garbage collection can be made to coexist with C++-style memory management.<p>4.  If you aren't going to include built-in threading or some better form of concurrency, why bother?  Unless you have a time machine and intend to go back to 1980 to introduce your language there.<p>5.  I don't think it's that clear cut (about requiring (or not) a standard library) but I won't argue this point.<p>6.  I think you're right in the sense that if you <i>do</i> include dynamic typing it is going to lead to creating something completely different than the stated goal.  I'd say it would be a <i>better</i> language, but it would not be the <i>correct</i> language for replacing a statically typed one.<p>7.  I think exceptions are an important language advance, but I can't dispute that they can cause a mess of problems when it comes to cross-language (or cross-thread) boundaries.<p>8.  If you look at C, it is not too verbose for coding the types of concepts which it supports (function calls with a small number of control-flow statements).  But it does not allow you to define new concepts.  Of <i>course</i> C is terse for calling functions:  <i>those are C's atoms, it's fundamental language element!</i>  So IMO comparing to C code based on how easy it is to call a function is the wrong thing to think about.  True improvements would come at the macro scale from better organization of groups of functions (e.g. into classes) or at a semantic level, by not needing to specify a function explicitly at all (e.g. operator overloading).",1279788983

(It's not just HN.)<p>The net lets us see all the great output from the most talented writers, thinkers, doers of their fields -- including people who we could imagine to be our peer group. But what we see is not an accurate sample -- it's dominated by the most remarkable, outliers by both skill and luck. (That is, there's massive survivorship bias; see Taleb's <i>Fooled by Randomness</i>.) Still, if we choose to look, it's in our face every hour of every day, in our news feeds, our Twitter streams, our Facebook statuses.<p>(Compare also: the quality of social networks whereby for almost everyone, your friends will have more friends than you [1]; the Matthew Effect, whereby small changes in initial endowment of power/fame/success can compound [2]; and how viewing top athletes can actually decrease someone's coordination in following challenges [3].)<p>In the plant and insect world, sometimes as one organism thrives, it sends off chemical signals that suppress the growth of its siblings/peers/neighbors, in an effect called <i>allelopathy</i>.<p>Information about others' great works and successes, transmitted by the net, may sometimes serve as a sort of memetic negative allelopathy. The message is: this territory is taken; you can't reach the sunshine here; try another place/strategy (or even just wither so your distant relatives can thrive). This can be be the subtext even if that's not the conscious intent of those relaying the information. Indeed, the reports may be intended as motivational, and sometimes be, while at other times being discouraging.<p>What to do? Not yet certain, but awareness that this mechanism is in play may help. You can recognize that what you're reading is not representative, and that comparing yourself against prominent outliers -- or even worse, <i>vague composites of outliers who are each the best in one dimension</i> -- is unrealistic and mentally unhealthy.<p>Actual progress for yourself may require detaching from the firehose a bit, picking a narrower focus. (HN's eclectic topic matter can be inherently defocusing.)<p>And remind yourself that despite various reptilian-hindbrain impulses, most interesting creative activity today is far from zero-sum. The outliers can win, and you can win too (even if you don't achieve outlier-sized success). Their success can expand your options, and they may wind up being your collaborators (formally or informally by simply participating in a mutual superstructure) moreso than your 'competitors'.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundamentalist/200911/why-your-friends-have-more-friends-you-do"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-scientific-fundament...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect</a><p>[3] Can't find the reference at the moment, but the study I recall showed people video of a top soccer player, and subsequently they performed worse on tasks requiring physical coordination.",1279788674

1537689,comment,1534905,1535678,0,0,dejb,,,"> One shouldn't think about legal issues in quantitative ways.<p>What about evidence? Presumably the copyright 'deriver' isn't just going to honestly detail how they stole the work. Surely an important part of the evidence is going to be what process was used to derive the work? If it can be established that an existing software package would produce an identical derivation surely that would be an important part of the evidence. Without understanding the processes of transformation (i.e. the spinning process) it may not be possible to accurately gauge the likelihood of the work having been derived versus a coincidence. This all seems to be firmly in the realm of quantities to me.<p>> It's this technocratically warped world view that lies at the basis of the bigger part of misunderstandings about the legal field and how it relates to technology.<p>I think the 'technocratically warped world view' is based on the notion that the function of the legal system is ultimately to serve society - not the other way around. Given that technological change is the major driver of social change it will necessarily also drive changes in the legal system. Situations where ancient laws and ignorant judges determine cases represent failures of the legal system and the more it fails the less relevant and powerful it must become for society to flourish. Inevitably it will be the legal system that needs to 'warp' itself towards the technocratic one rather than the other way around. Of course what I'm talking about is a medium/long term trend. Anyone expecting this to happen in any individual legal case would be making a big mistake.",1279788119

Finishing and shipping is a skill, like any other, you have to do it a lot to get good at it, but it's totally learnable. As is entrepreneurship.<p>Oh, and take all these people here as a challenge, not a reason. You aren't competing with them. You're the only person who will ever be ""you.""
