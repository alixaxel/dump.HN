Denial is spin, PR.  Hesitation is having less R&D resources to do anything about it.  It's well known Apple has a smaller headcount than Microsoft, and values certain things more than others.<p>Mr. Winer and you are totally entitled to your opinions, but mentioning the axes you have to grind in your criticism of Apple aren't great ways to be persuasive.<p>In order: OSX and Apple's hardware, because its worth owning, and nothing else.  ChromeOS(via Hexxeh, at this point) can't adjust screen brightness.  Ubuntu can't support 'proprietary wireless chipsets' on first boot - like it should matter. Vista was difficult to use for everything, it was disrespectful anyone got stuck with any of the 7 flavors of that turd.

It makes a lot of sense if your orders are 100,000-200,000 (or more) shares at a time. Individual traders (most often) only do the 10-20 shares or so... Check to see if  your broker has limits on the number of shares/order.<p>High frequency algo trading, as presently committed to by the big banks, relies (as others have noted) on advanced notification (if only, at times, milliseconds in advance...) which, as an individual, you probably won't get. But that just means you can't make use of the same algorithms as the banks.  You'll want to derive your own algorithms to exploit some specific pattern(s) that are different from those that rely on advanced word.  It's possible, but unless you're already in possession of some wealth, unlikely that you'll be able to design, implement and tweak your algorithm to profitability in anything like a year or so.

  - Should I build the perfect product and use a salesforce
    to push it on customers that does not happen to 
    know that we have the best product (ref. inc article),

Install? Thats a silly legacy concept anyway. Browsers DO sandbox code though, which is a good thing, but an OS could do that to ""native"" apps too.<p><i>Old versions aren't as much of a problem; updates can be just a refresh away</i><p>Desktop apps could be developed in ways that solves this too. Though the browsers ""refresh"" button is certianly a lot more convenient than anything we ever see used on desktop apps.<p><i>A browser is a consistent/familiar interface - people generally know how to interact with them</i><p>Hah, hardly. The <i>browser</i>, sure - but honestly, how much of the web really uses the browser interface? We have some basic navigation (switching apps, essentially - the address bar, bookmarks, back, forward) and a selection of currently executing apps (tabs, windows). The rest is done inside the browser as HTML - and this is HIGHLY inconsistent between websites/webapps. There is absolutely nothing consistent or familiar about them.<p><i>Runs on your iPhone, Android, PC, Wii, PS3...</i><p>Maybe one day the ""standards wars"" will settle and this will be completely true. Regardless, you could, conceptually, do this with traditional apps too. It would be a lot more dificult though - browser definitely shines here.",1279191754
