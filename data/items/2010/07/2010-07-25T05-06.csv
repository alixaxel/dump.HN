1545050,comment,1543935,1544279,0,0,jacobolus,,,"The problem is that education must be at such a massive scale that it's hard for one person to make an impact beyond locally. Just designing a curriculum doesn't work, because if teachers don't understand the pedagogy it won't ever get taught. With the current trend away from critical thinking and towards high-stakes testing, with the scary ""anti-elitist"" (anti-science, anti-empiricism) tendencies of broad swaths of the Republican party fundamentalist christian base which exert tremendous pressure on primary candidates & the textbook choosers in large influential states &c., and with the increasing involvement & influence of very large businesses in education whose bottom line is not necessarily closely related to the quality of instruction, it’s hard to see where proper science education is going to slot itself in.<p>One of the big reasons I spent a year working as an intern for One Laptop Per Child is that I strongly believe that getting as many kids as possible even a bit of exposure and experience with programmable computing environments (and ideally then also with some simple hardware hacking such as plugging various sensors into the audio in jack) is a sure way to plant the kind of approach to problems that is required to understand modern technology or work in science.<p>* * *<p>It's somewhat off the subject, but I've been reading Darwin’s <i>Voyage of the Beagle</i>, and it’s truly wonderful to see his mind at work. Not only is he constantly carefully observing the culture, geology, weather, flora/fauna, fossil record, etc. that he comes across on the trip, but also for nearly every observation he provides at least a speculative hypothesis and references various other people’s theories which are supported or contradicted by the observation in question, and also usually suggests further experiments or observations which would test or corroborate the hypothesis. (Occasionally there’s even a footnote explaining that his hypothesis at the time was later shown to be false.)<p>It’s the scientific method as clearly and purely as I’ve ever seen it working, and the result is that nearly every page has some kind of insight. I’m left with tons of my own questions in response, even in subject areas I’m not especially experienced in and don’t usually think much about, and the reading is quite exciting, even apart from the amusing situations he finds himself in.<p>I don’t know what the best way is to provide that kind of spark to children, but I’m completely sold on the notion that it’s desperately needed, and the most important thing a school could teach.",1280036831

You don't need that much romantic history to know that men have a strong appetite for sexual novelty, and that highly desirable men are not monogamous, that women know this ahead of time and are willingly complicit in their non-monogamy.<p>Ok, I guess for the type of guy who would write these critiques, some things need to be spelled out on paper.

1545044,comment,1543366,1543366,0,0,arocks,,,"I'm sorry if this might be slightly off-topic, as it focusses on the 'new BASIC' part of your question. However, the points outlined might be helpful to understand why Javascript isn't the best first language for pedagogy.<p>Compared to most languages, Python is possibly the best contender to the title of 'new BASIC'. It has an implementation that is more consistent than Javascript's and can even scale up to larger code-bases. The latter, I learnt in my early days, will soon become a necessity when it becomes difficult to keep track of your 20K lines of BASIC code!<p>Python could be a gateway to both server-side and client-side programmer. The latter could be useful while learning programming and can provide instant gratification with full-screen graphics say using Pygame/Pyglet. When the young programmer becomes confident enough that he wants to let his friends play with his creations, he can create web-apps using Python (say using Django), which seems to be the distribution mechanism of choice, going forward.<p>I agree that having an IDE is perhaps not a necessity compared to a REPL. There have been IDEs like Turbo Pascal which have near instantaneous compile times, but the learners tend to become overly dependent on IDEs. They are often unable to distinguish between the IDE and language, which is clearly undesirable.<p>Python works well with modest requirements. It has several REPL implementations (for e.g. the excellent ipython). On the other hand development is breezy even with simple syntax highlighting editor (for e.g. Notepad++).<p>Javascript has several gotchas which might confuse or dissuade a learner. I think this is a hangover from its early implementations than a language flaw per se. However, it prevents me from recommending it to a beginner.",1280036469

Here are my two cents:<p>1) The reason online Analytics (like say Google) works so well is that there is one time setup and you forget about it and just look at the results. But, in this case, it looks like the user will have to input it every time and that takes quite a bit of patience on the user side, day in and day out. Of course, your product should reduce work, not create more for your user. For example, maybe have a coupon scanner and let that be an indirect measurement for tracking where that customer came in from.<p>2) Please take a look at <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/</a> If you are going for a video intro, keep it clean and keep the surrounding interface simple. The interface, in my opinion, reminds me of Microsoft Frontpage template - at least the blue font is. And you should visit a color picker website (like Adobe Kuler) to at least get some better color themes.<p>3) The video - if you are selling this product primarily in the U.S, you should perhaps use an American accented voice simply because when a new prospect lands on your page and listens to the video, you don't want them to think that your company is abroad and that dealing with you will may seem like a hard thing. And the resolution of the browser in the video seems too low i.e. don't make it scrollable.<p>4) The homepage - it's too cluttered. again, see Dropbox for a simpler theme. In fact, I recommend that you take a good look A/B testing here - <a href=""http://www.abtests.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abtests.com/</a> The SAP example could be said for yours as well. Have the video, then at the right have a HUGE button for demo/signup.<p>5) Icons - they feel too generic. Definitely spend some time looking for some better ones or consider contracting your frontend to a designer.<p>In general, I left feeling that what you offer can be easily replicated in Excel or even Bento. I can see that this can be valuable if done correctly, but this manual data entry can be tedious when it has to be done for all customers.",1280035183
