The people who like C++ just silently <i>use it</i>, and feel no need to write advocacy blog posts for the language.  Even if they were to blog about it, it would be about as compelling as someone advocating for their favorite brand of screwdriver.  Like it or not, C++ is the incumbent, and it's neither interesting nor fun to read someone advocating for the status quo.<p>Whenever you find yourself arriving at an opinion about a programming language solely from rants that you read on some dude's blog, please keep in mind that you're probably being most heavily influenced by the very people <i>least qualified</i> to teach you anything useful about the language.

In general, the realization that death is, at least currently, inevitable has helped me deal with them.<p>If your suicidal thoughts are rooted in personal suffering, the realization that you have control over how you perceive events can be helpful. Instead of having to walk in a blizzard, you're getting to feel stuff you normally don't.<p>I'm not a spiritual person by any means, but I think that realizing that desire and suffering are intertwined is a good thing to realize.<p>If your suicidal ideation is caused by a more existential type of angst, I can recommend ""The Myth of Sisyphus"" by Camus. It helped me come to terms with the absurdity of existence more than just about anything else, but what worked for me may not work for you.<p>Other than advice already stated in this thread, that's about all I can offer without knowing you or your situation.<p>One more thing: your life will change.

Take what applies to you, and leave the rest.<p>I would recommend immediately reaching out in person to friends or family that you trust. If you have nobody that you trust with this, reach out to a suicide hotline. There's a national one at 800-273-8255. If you forget the number just google ""national suicide hotline"" and it should be a google-supplied first search result.<p>After reaching out for help, I think you should focus on treating the underlying depression that is leading to the suicidal thoughts. Here are a few things you might try:<p>1. Get your vitamin d level checked. This might sound like a funny thing to do, but many studies have shown links between vitamin d insufficiency/deficiency and depression. The specific test you want is the ""25-hydroxy vitamin-d test."" Some 60% of Americans have inadequate levels, and that number goes up the darker your skin gets. For hackers and other knowledge-workers, my guess is that the number is much higher, because we are inside all day. <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/vitamin-d-why-you-are-pro_b_585311.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dr-mark-hyman/vitamin-d-why-yo...</a><p>2. Exercise. Even if it's just walking around the block with your girlfriend, or brother, or dog, or mom, or alone. If there's a sport you used to play but don't anymore, pick it up. Climb rocks, or fence, or box, or ski. Dance, or fly kites, or garden, or whatever. But whatever you do, get physically active. Your body needs that, especially when you are feeling down. You would be surprised how much better you feel after some good physical activity.<p>3. Take things off your plate. You are not a machine. Shoot, even machines need rest. Don't take too much on your plate. Remember that even (especially) the most successful people take breaks and prioritize.<p>4. Remember that you aren't alone and you aren't crazy. Life throws us crap like this to make us stronger, and so we can relate to others' suffering. Remember that there is purpose in all your suffering.<p>5. Love your life, poor as it is. The journey is 9/10 of the fun. Laugh at it when it sucks, and realize that it's not as bad as it seems. Also don't acquire the ""if only"" disease. ""if only i had this, then I'd be happy...."" Acheiving milestones is awesome, and feels great, but then you go back to the journey -- the 9/10. Enjoy it all, and live in the now.",1279246560

I find it hard to believe that I'm able to be safe. I cope ironically through how my suicidal thoughts manifest. For me, they are normally about self-destruction and obliteration, not death, and that's pretty hard to do yourself.<p>Suicidal thoughts are not the whole story, though. It's easy to focus on the big dramatics, and ignore the greater effects. I persistantly have trouble sleeping, and depression and self-loathing have consistantly been a barrier for me. If it were not for my problems, I would have certainly got much more than a pass degree. I'm not coding as much as I would like, as I spend a lot of my free time managing my headspace rather than my passions.<p>Something that helps when in better moods is to remember, though, that I have got a degree. And I worked part time during university, too. I had to act as carer to my ex during that. I ran some pretty amazing student societies, and have done some big things. And now I'm a manager in a huge IT company, working on some impressive things. I'm learning to drive pretty fast. And I'm a trans woman.<p>You see, it's not as simple as saying ""go see a shrink"". I can't go to the NHS with my problems, as if I were to tell them that I see things (hence the throwaway account name), medical assistance for trans matters would be threatened. Drugs too are not great, for two reasons - they don't work, and they don't mix well with reality issues.<p>I hope to be able to afford private counselling soon, as this isn't that much fun. But I am functional at the moment, and I have amazing friends and family.<p>The biggest problem? That these issues just are not talked about. The media says that it's only ""crazy people"" who see things, people who stab others and get locked up, or people who can't work and function in the real world at all. Yet I'm sure there are many more just like me, who like me sit at work, being productive, all the whilst being convinced that they are being physically attacked. I'm having to use a throwaway, as I'm only 26, and have one hell of a distinctive name. We can't talk about this sort of stuff, and this stigma makes it worse.<p>So sometimes, to help with the thoughts, I write about them and share my experiences with others.<p>Other things I have found to help:\n* Stop drinking. Drinking makes me extremely depressive normally.<p>* Call amazing friends. I've got friends that are happy spending hours on the phone just making silly noises at me. It's extremely reassuring, and they have ordered (this is useful!) me to call them anytime I want or need. When I don't touch base with close friends and family regularly, my headspace tends to get even darker.<p>* Safe company. The useful thing about being in a number of minority groups is the easy access to a number of safe spaces and people. Even if I don't talk about these things with them, getting into an LGBT space, or a furmeet lets me feel amongst people who understand. And perhaps, now hackernews might be added ;)<p>* Comfort food. Chocolate, ice cream and cake, need I say more? :P<p>* Exercise. Damn I need to get out more, I love running and it feels amazing. And the fact that I can walk five miles in 70 minutes is something I should be more proud of!<p>* Eat right. Skipping meals really doesn't help at all, and I get grouchy without a balanced diet.<p>* Do something stimulating but not stressful. Having a new exciting thing to work on keeps me pleased for days - and better still, my bosses have noticed this!<p>(email: demonwatch(at)hushmail.com)",1279246121
