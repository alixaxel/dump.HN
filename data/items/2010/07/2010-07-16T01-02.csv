1519921,comment,1519370,1519370,0,0,lisper,,,"> If any of you have dealt with a similar situation, please let me know how to deal with this.<p>For what it's worth, you are not alone.  This happens to a lot of people.  It happened to me.  Still does on occasion.  But it's an individual thing.  There is no one-size-fits-all solution.  You have to try different things and find out what works for you.<p>Here's what works for me:<p>1.  Exercise.  It's amazing what a good dose of endorphines can do.<p>2.  Focusing on the many ways in which life could suck but doesn't, e.g.:<p><a href=""http://www.zoriah.net/blog/2009/04/guest-photographerphotojournalist-gmb-akash-child-labor.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zoriah.net/blog/2009/04/guest-photographerphotojo...</a><p>(If by chance you live in Bangladesh, then I'm afraid I am at a loss.)<p>3.  This is kind of hard to describe without making it sound like new-age bullshit.  What you want to do is to induce a sort of deliberate schizophrenia, to separate out two parts of your brain: the part that feels depressed and wants to stop the pain, and the part that recognizes that you can't or won't do it because the depressed part is not really thinking straight.  For some people, simply going this far is enough.  Just recognizing that emotional pain is something that happens <i>to</i> you, just like physical pain, can sometimes be enough to get through it.  If not, then you have to engage in some deliberate mental exercises to help your deliberative self gain enough control over your emotional self to keep from hurting too badly or doing yourself physical harm.  The key is to recognize that being depressed and/or suicidal is not an indication of any kind of personal flaw or failure, any more than having a backache.  It's just something that's gone wrong with your wiring.<p>All this assumes, of course, that you don't have some legitimate reason to feel depressed, in which case you need to figure out what that is and deal with it, or that you don't have some physiological problem that needs pharmaceutical help, in which case a doctor can help.<p>Good luck.",1279244875

1519914,comment,1519370,1519721,0,0,anonymator,,,"In 2008 I attempted suicide.<p>I have dealt with suicidal ideation off & on since I was around 7 years old. My brother committed suicide, and mental illness (including depression) runs in my family. I'm not crazy though, I swear :-)<p>I've read a number of people say things like, ""It's completely normal. You just have to deal with it like everyone else."" That's wrong, and really, really dangerous advice. Suicidal ideation is very different from feeling 'blue' every now and then. Suicidal ideation is an indication of something more serious, and if left unchecked can get much worse (did you read my opening line?). Not everyone can get out of depression on their own or with 'natural remedies'. Depression is an illness just like diabetes or hypertension. Sometimes medication is necessary to get better.<p>I'm glad to hear that you have an appointment with a doctor. That's an important step to take, even if you don't start medication or therapy. After my suicide attempt I saw a psychiatrist 2-3 times and never took medication or did any therapy, but it was honestly very helpful.<p>I wanted to say that point number 3 above is a huge key to getting better. Remember this: Thoughts lead to emotions, emotions lead to actions. If you don't want to commit suicide (the action), prevent what comes before it (emotions, thoughts). Don't <i>think</i> about suicide and you'll avoid <i>feeling</i> like suicide is the answer. It's hard, but it gets easier over time.<p>What also helped me--which my psychiatrist recommended--was to create and follow a daily routine. I freelanced from home at the time and found myself with a very erratic sleep pattern, I didn't exercise, and I rarely left my apartment. I got a part-time job that got me out of the house, stopped staying up until 2, 3, 4 in the morning, started exercising, and forced myself to do more socially with my friends. Now, I'm happy and productive.<p>As a side note, if you're interested in trying any natural remedies for depression, there are basically three options: 1) SAM-e, 2) 5-HTP, 3) St. John's Wort. I have listed them in the order of their generally accepted effectiveness for treating depression and, how would you say, time before affect? St. John's Wort typically takes 2-3 weeks (IIRC) before you start to feel it's effects. SAM-e is supposed to work with in a few days.<p>Hang in there man. Things are never as bad as you may think, and they will get better in time.",1279244711
1519913,comment,1518298,1518298,0,0,Smerity,,,"The most important detail noted is training over more data gets higher results than using a better algorithm. 
One of the recent pushes in the field of machine learning and natural language processing has been trying to bootstrap larger training corpora from smaller initial sets.<p>As an example, one of my friends did her thesis on trying to use simpler sentences (that you're either confident you have parsed correctly or have gold standard (i.e. correct) training data for) to parse more complex but related sentences (see [1])
This is useful as even if you don't have a huge amount of gold standard training data statistically the parser is far more likely to get the derivation correct for shorter sentences than for longer. Using those shorter sentences you can help in parsing longer sentences.<p>That's why Google is so powerful. I spent a summer internship there and they have two really powerful things - data and the tools and techniques to handle it. In one afternoon a single employee could run through more data than entire companies would use for months.<p>[1] ""Mozart was born in Salzburg in 1756"" vs ""Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on the 27th of January 1756 at 9 Getreidegasse in Salzburg"" (the latter is a slightly modified example from Wikipedia)",1279244658

And since there is no way for any individual to know in advance whether the drugs will be safe or effective for them in the long term, I don't think it makes much sense to recommend them except for short term use in an emergency or as an option of last resort.<p>If you've been tested for every nutritional imbalance, and you're getting daily exercise, and socializing sufficiently, and if your work/family situation is good, and if you're taking the appropriate nutritional supplements, and if you've already tried various therapists, then trying one of the various drugs on the market might make sense. But the fact is that these drugs aren't very effective for most people, are extremely addictive, and have a high rate of causing serious side effects, including ones that lead to permanent disability or death.<p>What's more, the drug makers often lie about the safety and efficacy of their drugs in the clinical trials to get them approved, so the reality is almost certainly worse than what's already being acknowledged.

This is the reference to flash orders.<p>The trick to being a HFT is to be big enough and fast enough that the exchanges pay <i>you</i> to trade. Thus, you don't necessarily have to make a profit on these trades. Then you are really a liquidity provider. Being an HFT is about size, speed and execution mostly, and ideas not so much. My advice is to not go after that market.  It is likely that you are three or five orders of magnitude too small.<p>Other strategies are more interesting for the small guy.

I absolutely believe eating foods you like, especially if they are naturally healthy, can help with depression. I think a reason many people become overweight is they seek something which provides something positive, like tasty foods, to alleviate depression. Unfortunately, they  often choose junk food, which I don't recommend as it can spike your energy level, then bring you back down. Eating healthy can provide a much nicer energy curve, which I think is very helpful. Like others have said, I also believe exercise can help. This is because you take on a positive task (betterment of your health) and feel good for completing that task, in addition to feeling better physically. Here again is something positive which I believe offsets negative energy/thoughts. Chemicals within the body may also play a role, but again, I'm no doctor. I do, however, strongly feel that positive thinking and acts are very helpful. On the other hand, negative thoughts can spiral downward and become even more of a problem, so dwelling on negative thoughts should be avoided.",1279242375
