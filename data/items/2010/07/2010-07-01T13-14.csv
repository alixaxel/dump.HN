The problem really is to condense all of that knowledge about the real world into a form that is computable. As that really famous example goes, how do you tell a computer that water is 'wet'?<p>However, this is still an extremely important development and it shows that sooner or later by leveraging the things computers are good at we will be able to solve such problems. I really don't think that it is something impossible to do. It just requires a new approach that none of us have thought about. After all not too long ago nuclear fission was said to be impossible, until a chain reaction was conceptualized.<p>Perhaps AI will go this way too, the difficult almost intractable problems will turn out to be easy under some new paradigm. Perhaps not. We'll never really know until we try.<p>So kudos Regina Barzilay and her team for pushing the limits.",1277992457

This is actually worse than downvoting, because if a submission gets enough flags it just gets killed outright. At least with downvoting, it just effects the point count, which I use as a shorthand to decide whether an article is worth reading or not.<p>I have only every used the flagging feature for articles that were completely inappropriate for Hacker News (e.g. stuff about politics, jokey stuff more appropriate for reddit, outright spam).
