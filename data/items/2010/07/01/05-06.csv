Very good way to announce the Amazon purchase to Woot users, then they'll have it shipped directly from Amazon.com showing the shipping/speed/logistics boost that Woot is going to get from Amazon.

Love it.<p>I'm guessing the Kindle device is already a loss-leader (anyone know?) at $189, but the extra $40 off is well worth the price when they're paying millions for Woot.

Here's why more money works: not everyone has the same expenses. Some of the best are married with kids. I don't like to spend time away from my kids or my wife, but knowing that when I take two weeks off its to go visit the wife's family that I'm paying to fly to Hawaii makes my life, and hers, that bit more bearable when she hasn't seen me for days. \nYes, a low salary will get you some young qualified programmers, or some older ones with no life. But you will increase your hiring pool by offering more money.\nNo, it doesn't solve the problem of how to tell the good ones from the shit ones, but it does increase the total number of good ones available.",1277961528
