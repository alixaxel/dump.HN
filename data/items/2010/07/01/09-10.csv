1477521,comment,1476723,1477168,0,0,loxs,,,"I disagree. Medicine is not that powerful. Doctors don't have that big power over people's lives. And the ones that do have are mostly edge cases, like it is in programming. Most of the doctors just move you around the ""system"". I can tell you this because I am a doctor myself. And gave up medicine in favor of programming.\nMedicine is a beauroucratic closed society, that is not willing to accept new members. They have the power and connections to make their profession seem ""elite"" and ""important"" and ""dangerous"". And they impose expensive university  education (which is mostly unneeded in order to ""do the job""), government regulations and all kinds of other hindrances in order to hide that their profession is just like the rest.\nFrom my experience so far, programming is much more difficult (unlike medicine, you need to think all the time), changes much faster, and changes are far more radical. In medicine you don't pick a new speciality every few months/years (like we do with languages). In medicine patients don't get released with new versions (incompatible with former ones), every other month. Doctors' tools (pharmaceuticals) don't change with the speed our tools (libraries, frameworks) change.  You don't have to pick different ""styles"" and ""philosophies"".<p>I guess you will now ask me ""why the hell did you choose programming then""? Yeah, I could earn more money with less work, with less thinking. But it would be much less enjoyable. And I guess this is the reason why programmers get paid less. We love our job.
