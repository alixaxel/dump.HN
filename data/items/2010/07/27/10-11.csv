If I could remove alcoholism without removing casual wine consumption, of course that would be preferable, but this choice isn't on the menu of the thought experiment.<p>Any world I choose will make some people better off and other people worse off (that's inevitable), but not in equal degrees (fallacy of gray - thinking that all gray is the same color). While making the choice, I don't have a strict deontological prohibition that freedom of any single person must never decrease, all else be damned. If saving one person from extreme harm requires reducing the consumer options of two other persons, I go for it. It's a matter of balance, you have to weigh all the consequences, not just the ones that affect you.<p>To disagree with my original comment you'd have to believe that a world with alcohol is truly better than a world without. I don't think you believe that. To determine your real opinion, imagine you're given the option of introducing another new addictive substance to the Earth's population. You know in advance that it will spread worldwide, such-and-such percentage of humans will be affected, and such-and-such percentage will lose everything they had and die miserable deaths as a result. To counterbalance that, some other people will have fun using the substance casually. Would you introduce the substance? How is this different from introducing alcohol to a world without it?

That's a huge cost.  Plus, when you're a fast-paced company, the ability to move quickly is invaluable, which EC2 definitely does allow, but dedicated does not.<p>Even without that, managed dedicated servers are still often more expensive.  Rackspace costs $420/mo[1] for their cheapest dedicated, which is roughly equivalent to 2 small EC2 instances (~$140/mo).  The Planet has a similar(ish) machine for $184/mo[2].<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/configurations.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rackspace.com/managed_hosting/configurations.php</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://www.theplanet.com/dedicated-hosting.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theplanet.com/dedicated-hosting.aspx</a>",1280225345

I suspect Stubbornella simply didn't check many numbers.<p>For example, maybe because a lot of women are working in people facing jobs (secretaries, receptionists), it distorts impressions. Meanwhile, the men are shoveling shit in the backyard. At the same time lots of men and women have ""better"" jobs, but they are not as visible. So the impression is ""women tend to become receptionists"".",1280225152

It makes it trivial to create, clone, archive, or upgrade servers, and you never have to worry about drive/CPU/motherboard/RAM failures bringing down your site at 3 AM.<p>As someone who's worked in a data centre before, I can say hardware problems only increase as you scale up. We had around 350 servers with an average of three drives each, and we probably went to the data centre to swap dead hard drives on average three times a week - SAS, SATA, or SCSI. Nevermind the time I spent testing motherboards, swapping CPUs out, etc.<p>Owning your own servers means dealing with maintenance and downtime. Virtualizing 10 servers on one physical server is great until that one physical server's RAM starts acting flaky, and then you have to take those 10 servers offline, or shift the VMs onto your other hardware.<p>Renting your servers typically means paying a monthly cost for the hardware, including RAM and disk, long after the fees have paid the DC back their costs.<p>For Reddit, being able to bring N extra nodes for X purpose (mysql, cassandra, web serving, etc.) with a few clicks in a few minutes is likely a huge draw for them. It means they can grow gradually (instead of having to shell out another $10-20k for a new server), and it means they can dynamically adjust to meet their needs. For example, if Monday is a busier day than Saturday by a significant stretch (and if their architecture allows it), they can bring more nodes online early Monday morning to handle the load. Take them offline until Thursday evening to handle the 'It's Friday, to hell with doing work' rush I'm sure they get, and so on.",1280225084
