My point is that it's not egregiously more biased than any other sample from academia or professional surveyors, and in many cases it's less biased.<p>Do you reject most academic psychology research because it is based on students at the college of the researcher?  Certainly that's a more biased sample.<p>Do you reject political polls because they're based on who answers calls from random phone numbers and then does not hang up once they realize it's a poller?<p>Do you reject most commercial research based on paid volunteers or visitors to sites with much smaller and more biased audiences than Facebook?<p>I state upfront in the article that this is based on MyType users who are on Facebook.  What more do you want?  If you want no bias, just do math and don't believe any data based on people, written by people, spoken by people, anything having to do with people.<p>The bottom line point is, this is much more rigorous than much of the crap blogs and media report on.  I'll take a random example that I googled for the iPad: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/06/ipad-sentiment-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/06/ipad-sentiment-analysis/</a>.  ""87% of tweets indicate intent to purchase the iPad"".  Give me a break.  Talk about bias.  The sampling errors there are horrific.<p>I'm just trying to maintain a reasonable perspective on MyType's data, not hide any facts about the shortcomings of it.  There are shortcomings, they're just not so bad to make the results ""entirely unreliable"".",1280199552

1550100,comment,1549773,1549773,0,0,wtallis,,,"I think that Ars is over-thinking it. The simple fact is that Intel's roadmaps lately haven't been all that well aligned to Apple's product lines. Back during the days of the Apple-Intel transition, Intel was all about killer laptop chips, which was the biggest weak point of the PPC chips of the day. Apple and Intel were a good match.<p>When it came time for Intel to introduce the successor to the Core 2 microarchitecture, they did it with the i7, a high-end desktop chip. Apple doesn't make a high-end desktop. They make small form-factor desktops and they make workstations. It shouldn't surprise anybody that the desktop i7 didn't get picked up by Apple quickly. When the Nehalem-based Xeons were released, Apple was the first to use them, in the Mac Pro. Much later, Apple was able to get the i5 and i7 into only the biggest of the iMacs, which have always (in the Intel era) been MacBook Pros at heart.<p>Things have been a bit different in the laptop department because of Intel's anti-competitive behavior with respect to graphics chips. First, they refuse to grant NVidia the licenses they need to make chipsets for the mobile Nehalem processors. Then, they refuse to release a mobile i7 that doesn't contain their pathetic integrated graphics that to Apple (who is trying to ensure all their customers can have GPU-accelerated video decoding and OpenCL) is just a big lump of wasted silicon. Thanks to Intel, Apple's laptops need to add an extra graphics chip to their already-crowded motherboards. That's why none of the 13"" machines have gotten an i5 yet: they're too small. In order to put an i5 in a MacBook, Apple would have make a major compromise or get really clever during a complete re-design of the internal layout.<p>Ars tries to partially attribute Apple's continued use of the Core 2 to a lack of engineering resources due to a focus on the iOS devices, but that sounds absurd given Apple's recent financial numbers. I think it can be entirely explained by the differing and conflicting interests of Apple and Intel. They undoubtedly are watching each other's mobile strategies, but that's not necessary to explain what's happening with the desktops.",1280199472

Google has become useless to me for a lot of searches -- many things that attract ""MFA"" -- because of the overwhelming amount of search spam.  The problem has gotten much worse over the last few years because of the content mills presumably.

Saying ""PHP is crap because it leaves its functions all over the floor"" is just a mean way of saying ""I vote that PHP should be changed so that it puts its functions back on the shelf before dinner time."" Picture a toolbox where, if you complained enough about your screwdriver slipping too much, it would <i>evolve</i> a new head design right before your eyes. The toolbox analogy seems to break down there, doesn't it?<p>The closest thing I can think of to a programming language that regular people deal with is an apartment/office building. Just by getting the ""user community"" rallied around an issue, you can actually get large changes made to the product itself. Thus, people are always, always shouting about what's wrong with their building, hoping that someone will agree and a mob will amass to Get Things Done.",1280199191

1550089,comment,1548321,1549648,0,0,jerf,,,"You need to try Erlang. (Or Haskell, but Erlang is more approachable.) You and every other Node.js partisan keep making criticisms that simply make it clear that you <i>have no clue what you are criticizing</i> and that doesn't make it terribly likely that you're going to sway me to your point of view.<p>""With a callback-based system, stacks are short, and you explicitly carry that state. You KNOW what state you're storing, and you can see it easily.""<p>Actually, no. You have implicit state carried around in the function closures and you will discover that it is very easy to have a leak in there that will be very hard to diagnose. I say this because I am speaking from experience.<p>(Remember, Node.js isn't a blinding new architecture. The architecture has been around for over a decade and I don't even know when the idea started. The only new aspect is that this time, it's <i>Javascript</i>. I've got a lot of experience with that architecture, and what that experience tells me is <i>never again!</i>)<p>On the other hand, it is very easy to examine an entire running Erlang system, see every process and the <i>exact contents</i> of its stack at that point in time, and the exact amount of memory currently allocated to it, and since Erlang doesn't have any sharing between processes, that state is everything about that process. It isn't always the best about giving back memory if you have long running processes, but I was able to diagnose which processes were consuming my RAM, determine why they were consuming my RAM, and test out a fix for the excessive RAM consumption (since it came in the form of sending a particular message sooner rather than later), <i>all without shutting down my server</i>.<p>You do not have that level of introspection and visibility in Node.js. I don't even have to ask.<p>""Many languages and many runtimes allocate stacks in megabytes, and store every local variable in it.""<p>I'm not talking about ""many languages"". I don't care about ""many languages"". I'm talking about <i>good</i> languages. Erlang can very easily allocate a couple hundred bytes to a process, or less. I'm not actually sure what the minimum allocation is, but it is certainly going to be competitive with a minimal Node.js handler.<p>""Receive a starting event, emit a done event -- you aggregate processes into sets of events, not into function calls. So yeah, it's not going to follow some of the same patterns that non-event-driven code follows, and event-driven code is going to look rather different than callback-passing code.""<p>None of that appears to have any relationship to coding in Erlang, from what I can see. Better technologies don't <i>have</i> to have events. They just <i>code right through</i> things. A loop for a simple proxy might look like:<p><pre><code>    proxy(SenderSocket, DestSocket) ->\n        case socket_read(Sender) of\n            done -> done; %% return to the original caller\n            {ok, Data} ->\n                socket_write(DestSocket, Data),\n                %% go back for more\n                proxy(SenderSocket, DestSocket);\n            {error, Error} ->\n                handle_error(Error)\n        end\n    end.\n</code></pre>\nI don't need to ""aggregate events""; I just tell the system what I want it to do, and it does it, and I don't sit here and specify how to wire functions together. In Erlang, the above will not block any other process. If you don't want it to block your current process, that's easy:<p><pre><code>    spawn(fun () -> proxy(SomeSender, SomeDest))\n</code></pre>\nBam. Separate process and the current process can move on with life. No hooking up events. No code blathering on about how to interleave the events in that process with the events in this process. It's just happening. (There is standard library code to make things even more reliable, but going into the built-in supervisor stuff would take too much time. Also, it's hitting below the belt, <i>no</i> other language has anything quite like OTP.)<p>Erlang doesn't actually use coroutines, Haskell does only upon request, coroutines for concurrency are just cooperative multitasking and I mock them as well, albeit for different reason.<p>You need to try Erlang. If only to know how to argue against it without arguing against some fictional language that doesn't exist.",1280198964
