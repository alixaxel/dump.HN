But you don't try to inhale as much as you can; you don't get sick getting too much of it -- although there is enough air around to inflate yourself like a balloon if you were actually addicted to it.<p>Addiction is when you take too much of something; under 5 cigarettes a day don't give you cancer; 1 glass of wine a day actually makes you healthier. But if you get addicted to tobacco or alcohol (or bad food) these things end up killing you.<p>Incidentally can modern addictions pg's talking about, really kill you? Can you die from Internet addiction? Porn/TV/Farmville addiction? If they can't kill you can they be called ""addictive""...?",1280213882

1550474,comment,1550295,1550440,0,0,_delirium,,,"It also doesn't seem to account for the reduction in gender diversity over the past 20 years or so. Around 1990, women were around 35% of CS majors, and today, they're around 17%. What accounts for that drop? I don't think it can be ""puzzles and very abstract concepts"". If anything, the core theory/systems/PLs areas have declined as a proportion of the overall CS curriculum over that time period, and more applications-focused areas have increased in prominence. Many CS departments now have HCI faculty and classes, for example, which virtually none did in 1990, and there's lots more robotics and other explicitly applications-oriented areas in the curriculum as well.<p>Not that <i>I</i> know why there's been a decline in women in CS over the past 20 years, either. But I think any explanation of why there aren't many women in CS now has to account for why there were more women in CS in 1990--- despite CS not being that much different at the time, and probably actually more ""hardcore"" systems/theory oriented.",1280213716

If you stop reading HN or Reddit or Facebook, you don't die.<p>So, saying that an addiction is about things you ""don't want to want"" makes sense if you add the caveat that it applies to things you don't need to survive as a human being.<p>EDIT: I should add that another way in which the breathing analogy fails is that for addictions, usually we refer to things that you do so much that it adversely impacts your everyday life in the sense it puts you in danger losing your job, your spouse, your friends, etc, or even if you don't lose them, you reduce your productivity and thus your overall chance at success in life.

There's a long-term trend of immigration & congestion supporting the eventual adoption of a rail plan, it's just a matter of time.<p>On the other side, I don't see any trends in California pointing towards sane governance, apart from the possibility of a constitutional convention (<a href=""http://www.repaircalifornia.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.repaircalifornia.org/</a>), which is hardly a safe bet.<p>So there's good reason to hope for Texas, I'd say, despite the history.<p>[1] incidentally, I hear that to get the airlines on board, the new Texas HSR plan terminates at the airports specifically, while the earlier plan focused stops at city centers, which might have been better for TOD, but then this makes for inter-modality.",1280212328

Why rain on someone else's parade?"" There are good arguments to be made for reverse discrimination, but ""can't you be happy for someone else?"" isn't one of them.<p>Other issues:<p><i>I believe CS and Web Development currently select for certain masculine qualities that are largely unrelated to someone’s prowess as a coder.

This is triply problematic--she dismisses out of hand the idea that men are better than women at abstract reasoning and such, but implicitly argues that the qualities of ""good developers"" are feminine and the qualities of ""code cowboys"" are both bad for development <i>and</i> masculine.<p>After all this, she complains that her talents were viewed as better suited to management, when all that supposedly-feminine stuff like teamwork and respecting people <i>are important parts of management</i>.<p>Incidentally, I think the reason for the gender gap is something she pointed out in all of this--women are less likely than men to engage in deeply focused solitary activities.

I love The Economist, but leave it to them to bemoan regulation, but leave out a simple and fundamental fact like that.<p>The article even mentioned how new tracks are being put in for long distance passenger traffic -- which will not impact the freight trains -- but that local traffic has to be on freight lines, and this does impact freight because of freight's erratic schedule. But perhaps with more use freight will be less erratic. Perhaps the best solution is to move freight transfer stations (where rail freight moves to trucks) out from cities, and allow passenger service closer in. This does not help freight that has to go through the city in the first place. But, if we can move off of coal a little faster, then maybe we will have the capacity for increased freight and passenger rail service.",1280211365

The state actually awarded a contract to a private group to build high-speed rail in the Dallas-San Antonio-Houston triangle, under terms like those you discuss, in 1991, but it was killed, largely by Southwest Airlines lobbying, in 1994. I went to high school in Texas 1996-2000, and a new high-speed rail plan was being discussed that entire time too, but the talk never went anywhere. In the early 2000s, it was revived once more, this time as part of an ambitious Trans-Texas Corridor (which would have had freight rail, high-speed rail, car-only freeways, and truck-only freeways), but that died a few years later as well, partly due to a nativist backlash against its role as the ""NAFTA superhighway"".<p>Now there's yet another HSR plan, separated back out from the road plans, which might work this time, but I probably wouldn't put any money on <i>this</i> being the year the 20+-year impasse is broken.
