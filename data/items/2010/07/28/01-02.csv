It's HARD.<p>And all that hard work, while it might help you scale up to the biggest multi-processor beast you can find - doesn't help you one bit when it comes to scaling horizontally to multiple nodes..... I'd wager, depending on the situation, that it gets right up in your face and in the way. But tha'ts back to comparing apples and oranges.<p>""scalable"" is about overall design - what needs to talk to what, how will it scale, will it be a purely shared-nothing environment like erlang where we're passing messages and can scale out horizontally like mad, but where every function call is effectively a full memory copy, possibly over a network?  Or do we nail it down to a precisely crafted C++ threaded app that our expert designers know down to it's finest detail, that's faster than sh*t througha  goose, and hey, it uses some evented stuff as well.<p>It seems the real rise interest in the event-driven nature of node.js is that it makes it obvious to even beginner programmers where the difference is - you are setting up some actions, and letting the OS kernel handle listening for the events for you in the fastest possible way.

Since that already works to distribute across processes on one machine, why bother adding another layer to pool native threads? It just adds to the complexity budget.<p>It could easily get you much lower (1/N) latencies on unloaded systems, but in most cases at high volume the gains aren't going to be very big compared to running another N-1 single-threaded processes per box and it would take more concerted effort to keep the request latencies consistent.<p>It seems obvious that it's worth compromising the model and adding locks or STM to get a N00% gain for a solitary request, but what if that's only a 10% gain when you're pumping out volume?

Certainly not anything like super professional heavy weight printed invites, but they work well enough. However, adding Microsoft Word + Curlz + amateur typography would just ruin the whole effect.<p>In short, I think that home printers can work, we just got to work on the quality of the typography.

With a birth rate of about 3.5 million people per year in the US, assuming everyone gets married once (a rough estimate), and there are two people per marriage (a less rough estimate), that should work out at 1.7 million marriages a year.
