However, this is a very <i>undesirable</i> property for modern software; instead, we want our builds to be exactly repeatable. If you download my software and build it, the results should be bit-for-bit identical to the results I get. If they're not, then how do you know if your build is correct?<p>It is funny how most software today is auto-customized using autotools and then a package maintainer for the software for some OS comes in and un-does all that auto-customization to get repeatable results. It would be much better to just assume there's going to be a package manager configuring everything exactly as he wants it, and avoid autotools completely.",1278654393

I didn't have the same disposable income all my corporate friends had.  I wish I started a company three years earlier when I was a freshmen.  No need to wait four years to write code and start a company, I would practice by building code you can use to make a profit.

1499878,comment,1499447,1499675,0,0,Evgeny,,,"There is not much difference in ""cancer correlation with plant proteins"" and ""cancer correlation with animal proteins"".\nHigh cholesterol is correlated with some cancers. But areas with high cholesterol are riddled with other risk factors. Campbell does not mention that.\nBreast cancer is correlated significantly with sugar, alcohol and industry hazards. The association with animal fats is not statistically significant. Campbell does not mention that.\nAreas with high animal food intake are not correlated with higher cancer rates at all.\nSchistosomiasis is a profoundly strong risk factor for developing colon cancer and rectal cancer. It also happens that cholesterol also correlates with schistosomiasis infection. In regions with close to zero schistosomiasis infection there is no positive correlation between cancer and cholesterol.\nLeukemia correlates strongly with working in industry. In the counties where few people work in industry, no correlation exists between cholesterol and leukemia. Cholesterol is actually slightly protective against leukemia.<p>The mortality rates for near-vegan and higher-animal-foods groups are quite similar, with the animal food group coming out more favorably in some cases (death from all cancers, myocardial infarction, brain and neurological diseases, lymphoma, cervix cancer). This little comparison might not carry a lot of scientific clout due to its small sample size, but it does blatantly undermine Campbell’s assessment.<p>Why does Campbell indict animal foods in cardiovascular disease (correlation of +1 for animal protein and -11 for fish protein), yet fail to mention that wheat flour has a correlation of +67 with heart attacks and coronary heart disease, and plant protein correlates at +25 with these conditions?<p>Why does Campbell overlook the unique Tuoli peoples documented in the China Study, who eat twice as much animal protein as the average American (including two pounds of casein-filled dairy per day)—yet don’t exhibit higher rates of any diseases Campbell ascribes to animal foods?<p>Why does Campbell point out the relationship between cholesterol and colorectal cancer (+33) but not mention the much higher relationship between sea vegetables and colorectal cancer (+76)?<p>Why does Campbell fail to mention that plant protein intake correlates positively with many of the “Western diseases” he blames cholesterol for—including +19 for colorectal cancers, +12 for cervix cancer, +15 for leukemia, +25 for myocardial infarction and coronary heart disease, +12 for diabetes, +1 for breast cancer, and +10 for stomach cancer?<p>Campbell demonstrated that casein promotes cancer in rats. He did not demonstrate that:\n- The casein-cancer mechanism behaves the same way in humans as in lab rats.\n- Casein promotes cancer not just when isolated, but also when occurring in its natural food form\n- There are no differences between casein and other types of animal protein that could impose different effects on cancer growth/tumorigenesis.<p>Results of another Campbells study:<p><i>20% menhaden oil diet, rich in omega 3 fatty acids, produced a significant decrease in the development of both the size and number of preneoplastic lesions when compared to a 20% corn oil diet rich in omega 6 fatty acids. This study provides evidence that fish oils, rich in omega 3 fatty acids, may have potential as inhibitory agents in cancer development.</i><p>Why does Campbell avoid mentioning anything potentially positive about animal products in “The China Study,” including  evidence unearthed by his own research?<p>In sum, “The China Study” is a compelling collection of carefully chosen data. Unfortunately for both health seekers and the scientific community, Campbell appears to exclude relevant information when it indicts plant foods as causative of disease, or when it shows potential benefits for animal products. This presents readers with a strongly misleading interpretation of the original China Study data, as well as a slanted perspective of nutritional research from other arenas (including some that Campbell himself conducted).",1278654305

1499824,comment,1498528,1499381,0,0,kaib,,,"> So by all means, explain to me why the non-gcc implementation (6g, 8g) for Google Go not being LLVM somehow isn't classic NIH.<p>Disclaimer: I know a bit about the background to the choice, I wasn't involved but I've seen the consequences having worked with the 5g arm compiler.<p>The code generation part of 5g/5l is on the order of 10k lines of C, the whole 8g/6g/5g compiler suite is ~115k. I don't know how to break down LLVM but the whole project looks like ~270k lines of C++ so the code generation is probably more than 10k.<p>Now imagine you are tasked with writing a compiler for an experimental language where one of the key features is blazingly fast compilation. The plan9 compilers are fast, you wrote them yourself so you know their strengths and weaknesses. The plan9 compilers are also reasonably small and written in C which you know well.<p>You know nothing about LLVM. It could be good but it would take some time to find out. You also don't know too much C++ and it would take some time to get up to speed.<p>I would be very interested in understanding why this is NIH as opposed to reasonable management of risk?",1278652040

In the end I wrote my own configure script in bourne shell. The shell script suited my needs fine and was much faster.<p>The selling point of the autoconf tools is that writing your own shell script is tedious and error prone.

1499819,comment,1498224,1499034,0,0,Gatsky,,,"The process is amazing. It's a giant highly optimized molecular recognition library. Random diversity in antibody binding motifs is generated by guided mutation of the DNA coding for the proteins in the antibody. This wide repertoire is then screened for antibodies that react to 'self' molecular patterns in the body, and the B cells producing those self-reacting antibodies are deleted. One B cell produces only one kind of antibody.<p>There is also evidence that this antibody repertoire is further primed and refined by constant interaction with the incredible molecular diversity produced from the bacteria that live on our mucosa (that is, barrier interfaces with the environment like the lining of the gut and lungs and the skin).<p>The immune system naturally tweaks antibodies to make them more efficient at binding (Affinity maturation it's called). If you are trying to make a vaccine, you are better off starting off with an antibody which has already had all the hard work done on it.<p>It should be pointed out that the donor they used is actually infected with HIV, the antibody didn't protect him because prior to infection it wasn't affinity matured or present in high enough concentration.<p>If there was a heirarchy of medical treatments, vaccines would surely be at the top. A jab when you are too young to remember and suddenly debilitating fatal diseases that have plagued humans for thousands of years are no longer a problem. The immune system is unique in that you can give information to it, you can communicate with it. It's an information technology, actually. I think this is why vaccines are so fantastic, it is a treatment that collaborates with the body. Pretty much all other medical therapies involved taking a broken system and breaking it even more to achieve some kind of withered stability which is inevitability temporary and has consequences for the organism as a whole (eg giving steroids for rheumatoid arthritis, chemotherapy for cancer).<p>The seasonal flu vaccine is a global immune system in action. It's a molecular rss feed, an app update, a glycoprotein tweet whatever analogy you care to use, perhaps one day an individual's immune system will be part of a greater whole linked via information tech. The immune cloud it might be called.<p>And millions will still die because of war and poor sanitation and exploitation.",1278651946
