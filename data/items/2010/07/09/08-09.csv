1500154,comment,1499926,1499926,0,0,philwelch,,,"Telephone survey taker. Much less. In fact, I hated it worse than being a nighttime post-event arena janitor.<p>Most people assume you're a telemarketer if you call them to do a survey, so they hang up. By policy, anyone who hung up had to be called back because we officially assumed their phone line spontaneously glitched. Anybody who said they weren't interested and hung up <i>before we clarified we were taking a survey</i> had to be called back because we officially assumed they thought we were telemarketers. (They weren't called back right away, but put back in the hopper for future autodialing.) So I'm pretty sure my employer was evil. On top of that, one of our common survey techniques was to mail people a videotape with a terrible sitcom pilot on it, and then ask them about the ads we put on the videotape. On the initial setup call we act like we want them to review the sitcom, and they're like, ""Sure, I like sitcoms!"". I never saw the tape, but I was told the show itself was atrocious, and the technique was simply to get them to see the ad.<p>There were interesting parts (doing a survey for a bank, I spoke to a Texas millionaire who was more than happy to talk, in detail, about how much he hated Smith Barney, and made disparaging remarks about ""yankee banks""; old lifelong female smokers whose gender I couldn't easily distinguish over the phone; drunk hockey fans upset at me for calling during the Stanley Cup Finals; being briefed on the proper pronunciation of California placenames for a political survey, and then listening to strong political opinions and suspicions of bias when in fact I knew little and cared less about the issue in the first place). I had fun using a pseudonym, met a girl at work, lost my virginity. As far as bad jobs go, it definitely had its good parts.<p>In any job where you have to deal with the public, you have a facade of fake niceness which overcomes you. You call everyone ""sir"" or ""ma'am"", talk calmly, try to sound like you're smiling. Well, I was working on Father's Day, and apparently some people <i>get really pissed off about being called on Father's Day</i>. Specifically this one guy, whose voice and tone and anger had exactly the right qualities--ironically, very similar to those of my <i>own</i> father--to instantly piss me off. He started cussing me out, and instantly the calmness and patience wore off, with just enough left of my facade of fake niceness left to vigorously shout into the headset ""<i>fuck you too, sir!</i>"" I was more or less fired on the spot for lacking the mellowness of my coworkers, who by and large smoked copious amounts of marijuana.<p>Epilogue: For the next couple weeks, I went into work with aforementioned girl every Friday to pick up my last paychecks. The managers seemed somewhat displeased about that.<p>Some time later, I got back in touch with the girl (who I had stopped seeing). The whole dialing system was routed through a computer, which also handled timekeeping and statistics and so forth, so if you took a break you'd log that on the computer. She told me someone found a bug in their computer system so you could actually take an indefinite paid break and no one would be the wiser. Shortly after that the call center went out of business.",1278665185

Did I miss any?)<p>- windows software<p>- windows drivers (probably less important for a netbook, but I sure wish my scanner and laser printer and wifi hotspots all worked with my eee PC's xandros).<p>- windows itself is familiar, and people know their way around it.<p>- Microsoft sells windows for OEM notebooks really cheap (like $20 I think). An astute move.<p>- x86 also runs lots of linux binaries (and other OSes), but I don't think this is a big factor since you can recompile (and eg ubuntu has done this for ARM already), and it's not a selling point for the 95% of people who don't use linux.<p>ARM Pros:<p>- lower power consumption (but I believe the display is the main power drain at this point)<p>- cheaper (but Intel mobile CPUs are priced competitively)<p>- to combat ""windows software"": webapps seem to be used more than native apps these days (what % of your PC time is outside a browser? I myself am only outside a browser for compilation and vim).<p>- to combat ""windows drivers"": a netbook is primarily mobile; and if it has 3G, it doesn't even need wifi compatibility.<p>- to combat ""windows familiarity"": the browser is already familiar. If that works, the rest is of secondary importance<p>- linux is cheaper than windows (though I'm not sure if that is true for special distributions with higher usability, eg. I'm sure xandros for the eee PC is sold for-profit).<p>Overall, it seems to be in flux: platform is shifting; price and power consumption must be considered over all components not just CPU.<p>However, there's a larger trend at work here: netbooks are waning in popularity. The eee PC is no longer available in the tiny 7 inch size, and the most popular one is 10 inch - merging closely with 12 inch laptops. The ""tiny form-factor"" space seems to be taken over by touchscreen smart phones (not just the iPhone, but also android and so on.

Requests for demos before you're ready, requests for interviews with the press, requests for information by potential investors all take time, which is time that you should better be spending building your product.<p>Second, we didn't want to alert our competitors to what we're doing. While we didn't believe that any of them could innovate faster than we were, we didn't want them to know what our marketing and technology direction was, and thus try to poison the market's mind to our message before we could give it in our own words. Otherwise, by the time we DID give it in our own words, people would have predisposed to think badly of it.<p>There's also the non-customer competition to think of: recruiters (we're in a hyper-competitive market for talent), who will know what you're doing and target your employees; VCs who will at least ponder the notion of grabbing a team and overcapitalizing them and say ""do that idea and get it to market before the other guys."" This might seem far-fetched, but if you don't have any real benefit in opening to the world, they're definite potential downsides.<p>Finally, we needed to make sure that we had something very tangible to show the world (i.e. customers) when we do come out. If we had made a big display of our story, and then gotten customers interested, and then said ""thanks for your interest; come back in a year when we have a demo to show you"" it would have been a complete turnoff. Most of the people who we think of as prospects will find out about the company now, and we're ready to come in and give a professional display of what we're doing.<p>What we DIDN'T do was go completely dark. People who we knew and trusted we've worked with the whole time. People who we felt could add value we sought out. We didn't just go into a bunker, but we didn't splash our wares out there for anyone in the world to see.<p>Stealth-mode is definitely an option for the right firm.",1278662598

On Mac OSX at least, gcc uses SSE by default for floating point operations.<p>It's like compiling for ARM and forcing codegen into Thumb mode so it looks worse performance-wise.",1278662517
