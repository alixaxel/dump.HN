I've considered myself a hacker of sorts, but most of what I do is simply to satisfy my own personal desires - tiny rails webapps, cool js animations whenever I feel like proving to someone that you don't need flash, and blinding desire to have the cleanest code :) I'd love to have a startup someday, and I spend hours reading and thinking obsessively about what kind of business I'd like to run, what kind of experience a user should be presented with, etc.<p>So I'm doing what I consider a decent, normal plan. I'm current on an L1 visa in the bay area, and I'll look for a job that'll give me an H1. I'm getting married soon, and will bring the wife back here. All's well-ish.<p>But The US is scaring the pants off me. On a daily basis I read about how the government is going more into debt, about rabid tea-party fans, internet kill-switches, racism, police brutality, California's financial misery. It's enough to make me reconsider moving back to India, but I'd REALLY like to work with some of the companies I admire so much.<p>So I have 2 questions - 
1. Am I simply being paranoid? Is it just because I read too much reddit, etc that I feel this way and I just need to relax? Is it worth paying so much to rent in the bay area, and stuff will work itself out?<p>2. If I had to move somewhere, where should I go to? How easy is it to find a great web developer job in Europe/Australia/NZ/wherever? A place that'll ideally help me migrate, and would be a good place to raise  family?<p>I'd love pointers, discussions, anything. Thanks HN.",1278719229

A small percentage of people are suicidal or stupid enough to kill or injure themselves by ignoring or circumventing protective measures  but we don't consider their rights violated as a result; the  ratio of zoo deaths:zoo visitors (or whatever) is so low that the social benefit far exceeds the cost. If people in Mexico felt no particular motivation to enter the US other than for tourism, then we would expect to see at most 21 deaths annually on the Mexican side (~7m border area population/~0.003% suicide rate). Interestingly, we could expect up to 75 on the US side (also ~7m border population/0.012% s.r.).<p>I'm not sure what we do with the bodies in this hypothetical minefield; perhaps leave them there as a warning, because we don't want expensive border patrol agents to die removing them for burial. sure, they could be issued with maps or the mines could be turned off remotely, but as hackers we can all see the potential security pitfalls in such safety procedures. Given past administrative lapses with things as important as nuclear weapons, it's clear that we can't trust anyone - especially not government employees - to maintain the security of our minefield, so it would be better to shred all our maps as soon as we've deployed the things. I gather this is often what happens in a military context. It's true that this might result in avoidable future inconvenience if we ever develop a more comfortable relationship with Mexico, since removing the landmines would be dangerous and expensive. It would probably be better to turn the fence into a tourist attraction - people could buy a ticket to climb into guard towers and machine-gun cardboard targets of border jumpers, say. This would eventually set off (most of) the landmines, and tap into the unexploited commercial potential of historical killing zones.<p>Returning to the possibility of people crossing minefields, economic opportunity is enormously tempting to people notwithstanding the possibility of danger: it is a fundamental driver of history. We have gone to the moon and the ocean depths, fought wars, and died in vast numbers in order to gain economic advantages. About 3% of the world population is estimated have migrated from one country to another for economic reasons, and of course people often migrate within countries - either freely, as in the US, or illegally, as in places like China where choice of residence is considered a privilege rather than a right.<p>The interior German border mentioned above was regarded as one of the most secure ever; it actually had minefields, as well as guard towers with machine guns and so forth, and only consumed about 0.4% of the DDR's annual GDP by the time the country collapsed. Despite this outstanding achievement, people <i>still</i> insisted on sneaking across it, to the tune of about 120 a year. The East German government had a plan to reduce this by adding more security, but postponed it for lack of ready cash. It's unknown how many people died; most estimates are in the low thousands. Not all went across the border on foot; some traveled in hot air balloons, some swam or used inflatables to travel by sea, and some were smuggled inside commercial vehicles.<p>Of course, a key difference is that the DDR was more concerned with keeping people inside while you are more concerned with keeping them out. Whether this will have much influence at the individual level is hard to say. Notions about all men having inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness have been responsible for large-scale subversive behavior in the past, and if anything, the popularity of such ideas seems to have spread since then. Clearly, these concepts  of fundamental equality and inalienable rights need to be curtailed and decisions about their availability placed in the hands of qualified administrators, who can then issue them in projectile form.",1278718827

I was referring to the instance near the beginning where Arrington drove the robot forward, directly into Dan Casner, a few times. That mistake will almost certainly be repeated by everybody who uses QA, as they try to get a better view of the people they're talking to. So, I was commenting on the lack of a hard limit on how close one can get to objects directly in front of the robot. Will this be addressed in the final implementation?<p>I believe there might also be a ROS package that detects ankles (well, legs) in 2D scans, which could help.",1278717621

The highest priority now is monetization.  They need to come up with ways to get paid sufficiently to expand.<p>Here are the things they can do:
  1. Place more ads.  I don't buy the notion that many reddit users run ad-blockers.  Even half of them do, you still get 140M/month page views.
  2. Get Google AdSense, to place content-related ads.
  3. Sponsorship.  Have companies to sponsor some subreddits and add companies promotion and events.
  4. Paid submission, clearly marked so.  Company ad and product/service announcement can go there.  E.g. all the webhosting promotion deals going on now.
  5. Create some deal/coupon/onsales subreddits.  Have companies feed them and pay for them.  Rather than just having user-generated content, have companies generated content as well, and get paid for them.
  6. CPA revenue sharing.  Give redditers some percentage of discount when they go to a merchant's site to purchase something from a reddit link.  Reddit takes a cut.  It's a win-win-win setup, merchant sells a product minus the marketing cost which becomes the redditers' discount and reddit's share.<p>There are so many ways to skin this cat.

Or how inflation drastically changed effective tax rates for many families as it made the personal exemption more a historical curiosity than an effective tax policy for, say, the middle class.<p>As for pay as you go, sure, but not too relevant in an era where Federal spending is generating annual deficits of a trillion dollars this year and last as of about now (<a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/107669-deficit-hits-1-trillion-in-june-for-second-straight-year"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/107669-deficit-...</a>), three months before the end of the Federal fiscal year.

That's impossible requirement. Doing away with GIL means doing away with refcounting, or the performance penality is unavoidable. Doing away with refcounting means major changes of third party modules C API.<p>The issue people have is that Python 3.0 is introducing a bunch of stuff that makes code incompatible in different ways - mostly for aesthetical reasons, but does not deliver stuff that people are calling for again and again - performance and dropping the GIL.<p>Oh, and for people saying ""use multiple processes"" have never really had a problem where the process has multiple gigabytes of state that it needs to do its work. The state that can be easily shared in multithreaded mode, but can be only shared with a great deal of manual work in multiprocess situation.<p>Yes, you then do distribution over multiple machines too, but that doesn't solve your problem that you cannot afford running a separate python process on each of 12 cores, each process taking 10gb of memory.
