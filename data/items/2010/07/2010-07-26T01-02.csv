1546860,comment,1546695,1546763,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>it makes me question why exactly AirBnB was so up in arms about this</i><p>Well, one obvious problem is that losing a big subset of your business is always bad.<p>But another problem, which I just found, is that these fine points of the law, if they exist, are nowhere to be seen on the web. All the immediately obvious Google hits paraphrase the law as ""AirBnB and Craigslist short-term rentals now illegal in NYC"". So that's a first-order marketing problem.<p>It also adds fuel to the FUD fire, as we are seeing right here in the linked article. Suddenly every AirBnB host is being accused of running a flea-infested, credit-card-scamming, fire-hazard rat trap. That's a second-order marketing problem, but it could prove even worse than the first-order one: The law only applies in NYC, but FUD can spread everywhere.<p>Finally, there are the legal problems. This law gives the cops, and whoever tips off the cops, a lever with which to hassle AirBnB guests and hosts alike. Just because you're ultimately going to be found innocent doesn't mean that being hassled by the cops is a barrel of fun. If it happens to any extent it's bound to hurt the reputation of services like AirBnB, especially among foreign travelers, who are probably damn scared of American police as it is.<p>And, of course, to prevent a raft of lawsuits AirBnB must now carefully educate its NYC hosts about the law, and pay a lawyer to draft an airtight agreement for the hosts to sign to indicate that they understand the law, and defend any lawsuits that spring up when people get busted in NYC and blame AirBnB anyway despite all those precautions...",1280109060

1546857,comment,1546695,1546763,0,0,patio11,,,"I don't remember any particular public comment from AirBnB.  Speaking generally, I think any business would react negatively to having a powerful competitor convince the government to rule a segment of their business illegal.  After all, all it takes is a quick amendment to the law later to eliminate ""the loophole being abused by vagrants, drunks, and foreigners"" and suddenly you're guilty of Felony Interference With Business Model.<p>One's marketing and PR posture does not necessarily mirror the totality of one's business.  If I was planting an article in the New York Times, it would focus on a poor Hispanic girl learning at a NYC school which has a number who loves school now rather than on a middle class white boy learning at a suburban Illinois school which has a name who got a candied apple at the Halloween party last year.

Losing one's job could mean loosing health care and losing the place to live. When before it could have been not being able to afford good food, clothes, TVs, a car.<p>Consequently the 2 largest reasons for bankruptcies are : health care bills and mortgage payments, usually as a result of losing a job. (Of course, jobs are often ""lost suddenly"" no long after a ""cancer"" diagnosis).<p>An employer can excert quite a bit of control over an employee if they know the employee has a mortgage to pay, and all of his familiy is on that employer's insurance.  An employee couldn't be ""squeezed"" as much if they didn't have a large mortgage and could walk out and his family could retain the insurance.  This has been postulated is also the reason why per employee productivity has been going up since the 70s -- people simply have been putting in more hours and doing more work because they are afraid of losing their jobs.<p>(I don't have any data to back this up at the moment, downvote if you like).",1280108949

It would complicate things during an investigation if you had information on your hard drive, even if you could document that it had come from an outside commercial source.  With some information, even if it is ""known"" by the public, having access to it through classified channels is a way to vet the information, so if someone posted ""super secret a"" to a website, and you commented ""oh, yes, I've heard of that"", you would actually be corroborating information and leaking classified information.<p>FWIW, nothing in these seems to be particularly damning of the US.

But you can control how much ""concept"" and ""polish"" you'll throw in with it.  If you estimate that it will take you two months working alone to produce a prototype that will interest customers, what is the right amount of time to talk to customers before you write your first line of code?  I'd say a few days--in my view, startups should do this early on, instead of jumping in right away.<p>As for the ""ideas"" part of ""concept""--I've been surprised how easy it is for me to turn on ideas like a tap.  The insight that made me completely rethink what I'm working on now came to me late at night when I had forced myself off the computer because I wanted to start getting to bed earlier.  But even if you can't turn on ideas like a tap, how much time should you spend recording the ideas that do come up and doing research on the internet?  My guess--quite a bit, but it'd be even better if you could outsource this work to a nontechnical cofounder.  (Too bad I haven't been able to find anyone who meets my standards for this and wants to work with me on the product I'm building.)<p>The amount of ""polish"" you should do before serious PR efforts is extremely situation-dependent.<p>- If you're entering an established market with a bunch of small innovations over your competition (Quora), you should do a lot of polish so your product will genuinely be the best thing out there (and they did).<p>- If you're doing something totally new, a moderate amount of polish is probably better--just enough to avoid acquiring a bad reputation.<p>- If your customers are going to be spending significant cash with you, polish is key so you seem (and actually are) trustworthy.<p>""The answer to this question is obviously the former because the latter almost never gets done.""<p>If you know you're likely to irrationally give up on a product idea because your morale is low or irrationally continue with a product idea regardless of whether customers say it'll be useless, obviously those are factors to take in to account.<p>Personally, I wouldn't be afraid to, say, spend a long time building a better version of Ebay without doing any releases if I was convinced that people would switch to my site if and only if it was a significant improvement.  If my intuition changed partway through the development process (without any solid external evidence or new observations--just a change in my gut feeling) then I would say ""well, my intuition now isn't much better informed than my intuition at the beginning of the project--they're equally valid intuitions"" and operate as if the average of my two intuitions were true (say, wrap up what I've got so far and make a solid effort at releasing it.

1546786,comment,1546310,1546625,0,0,jewbacca,,,"Haskell has that exact same definition for its Maybe type here [1]:<p><pre><code>  data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
</code></pre>
After which it defines the monad operations on that type<p><pre><code>  instance Monad Maybe where
    [...]
</code></pre>
This says ""the Maybe type is a monad"", but the Maybe type could exist and be used without this, as I gather you're familiar with from ML.<p>When you use it a bare type, every time in your code you use a Maybe, you have to manually check for Nothing and extract the value in Just.  And you can't compose functions involving Maybe without either letting Maybe bleed into the input types of functions where it is not necessary, or writing some clever wrappers (which will probably actually end up defining a monad).<p>Using Maybe in this way has a common structure:<p><pre><code>  f :: Maybe a -> Maybe b
  f Nothing   = Nothing
  f (Just x)  = Just (do something with x)
</code></pre>
Pass on Nothing from Nothing, apply the internal logic of the function if there's Just something.  We can abstract this out, meaning we can write functions  (a -> Maybe b), and compose them to take care of the Just/Nothing check.  We can also do other things, like take functions with no knowledge of Maybe and ""lift"" them from  (a -> b) to  (Maybe a -> Maybe b).  Here's the simplest expression of this abstraction:<p><pre><code>  wrapMaybe :: Maybe a -> (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe b
  wrapMaybe Nothing f  = Nothing
  wrapMaybe (Just x) f = f x
</code></pre>
... this is bind for Maybe, the dreaded (>>=) that scares people away from Haskell.[2]  It's half the definition of the Maybe monad:<p><pre><code>  instance Monad Maybe where
    Nothing  >>= f  = Nothing
    (Just x) >>= f  = f x
    return x        = Just x
</code></pre>
It's known as a monad because monads are a further abstraction, expressing a structure in common with other patterns than Maybe:<p><pre><code>  class Monad m where:
    (>>=)   :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b    -- (AKA bind)
    return  :: a -> m b
</code></pre>
Just by defining these two functions for a type (in this case the Maybe type), a bunch of higher-order functions, like the ""lifting"" I mentioned, and composition of monadic functions similar to composition of normal functions, and composition of monads to stack the effects they represent, are already defined, derived from these two functions (return and bind/>>=), taking advantage of having the monadic structure in common.<p>What seems trivial with Maybe as a monad is that ""return"", the other part of defining a monad, is just the data constructor Just, whereas in other monads it's more complicated.<p>---<p>EDIT: I had previously defined: (Just x) >>= f = Just (f x) -- this is actually fmap for Maybe, which is also the lifting function I mentioned<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/libraries/base-4.2.0.1/src/Data-Maybe.html#Maybe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/libraries/base-4...</a><p>[2] Forgive me, it is at this point that I realize you may actually know all about monads and were just wondering what's monadic about Maybe.

This is especially true for non-trivial applications, where there are more than two or three callbacks chained together.<p>However, you can counter-argue that the additional complexity isn't endemic to the programming model, only certain languages.  Also, in languages which support multiple threads (read: not Javascript), a hybrid approach that uses events where possible, and threads where necessary, may retain many of the benefits of the event-based approach.",1280106554

But the idea that a Linux desktop is somehow more user-friendly or accessible because it has 'package management' or an awesome terminal is absurd.  I somewhat suspect that sort of dreadful idea is part of the reason why there is no competitive Linux-based consumer OS, to date.",1280106536

You can gain a lot of information about what does and does not work by observing and participating in the process for a while.     Stay at home or live cheap and put some of that decent salary into savings for if/when you commit to your own project full time.<p>Nothing wrong with developing your own product on the side or ""after hours"", although be aware that at many startups most positions have some kind of operational component and/or tight deadlines, which might interfere with after hours projects.  (Not all startups/small companies are like this of course).<p>Make sure that if you are developing something on your own time that it does not compete with the company's product line, you will often have to sign a contract to that effect.   Along the same lines, be sure to have a clear line between things you develop for the company and things you develop for yourself - keep a separate machine for your own code, don't use your employer's equipment or even a personal machine with your employer's code checked out on it.  The same advice goes for freelance projects.",1280106494

Basically, short term rentals are acceptable as long as the owner is present... this means less competition for your average AirBnB user.<p>Given this exemption, it makes me question why exactly AirBnB was so up in arms about this, especially with their rhetoric being centered on protecting the little guy.
