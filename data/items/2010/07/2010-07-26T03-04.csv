1547098,comment,1533384,1533752,0,0,Groxx,,,"You say this, yet the submitter has been here <i>over 1000 days</i>, and over 100 longer than you.  Evidently at least <i>some</i> of the long-timers, from when this was a <i>much</i> more closed environment, do indeed see this as interesting news.<p>So the question becomes: what's the definition of ""hacker news"", if not a user-submitted aggregator?  And where do you define what is and what is not HN-worthy?  It's apparently not age-related, nor precedence, nor community, and I don't know how you'd define what's hacker-related and what's not, barring strict, <i>literal</i> ""hacks"" (and then how about circuit bending to make music?).",1280116756
1547097,comment,1544247,1544247,0,0,zach,,,"There was a very clever hack that econ professor Robert Shiller (of housing-market fame) came up with to avoid having to deal with secondary markets like futures trading.<p>It goes like this: there are a pair of ETFs, with equal amounts of outstanding shares.  Each share in an ETF represents one portion of a claim on $120 (for example).  But the exact amount that each of the two is entitled to seesaws based on some external variable, such as the future market for crude oil.  So if a barrel of crude is priced at $40, one fund (the ""up"" ETF) will be valued at $40 per share and its paired fund (the ""down"" ETF) will be valued at $80 a share. The shares come into existence in pairs and can only be redeemed at the end of the fund's lifetime.<p>As you can see, this offers a nice solution to the horrendous problems seen in the article.  However, when this idea was actually turned into a real product (MacroShares), it ran into real-world problems again and again.<p>Their first oil funds had to be closed early because it was actually based on that $120 figure -- and when the price of oil shot up close to that level, it triggered an automatic termination.  And when they got their $200-a-barrel-max follow-on running, it had lost a lot of the momentum of the earlier funds.<p>But their major problem was that their complexity was all in full view of the traders, and people found it hard to really understand.  Because even though its current asset value was based on the price of oil on a commodity exchange, the ""up"" version often had a very large premium over that price (and the ""down"" ETF a discount).  That was the effect of contango -- people were figuring in the rising future value of the oil.  So in fact, it was actually <i>providing a more accurate price than the commodity market</i> for the storage-free value of a barrel of oil!<p>Now, that's fascinating and all, but investors wanted a product based on the commodity market value, so it made things annoyingly obscure.  Add to that the really complex situation when factoring in the possibility of early termination -- in which case the future price doesn't matter at all because the funds are paid off according to the commodity price at the point of termination -- and things just got to be too much.<p>MacroShares ended up closing their oil funds in the middle of last year, replacing them with a pair of US city real estate index (yes, the Case-Shiller index) ETFs which seemed interesting but were <i>wildly</i> unpopular.  It looks pretty bad for the concept right now, but they are probably just waiting in the wings for the next opportunity since they can provide a way to invest in things that otherwise would never be feasible.",1280116744

Make a reasonable assumption about the product's lifetime - let's say 5 years - project out those 5 years of profit, discount each year using a reasonable rate of return for a similarly risky investment (maybe 5-10%), and add up all discounted cash flows.

You should disregard it, and focus on the paragraphs below. (EDIT ends)<p>However, if you are going to get up in arms about the potential for noisy guests, and require legislation to prevent it in some way, it makes far more sense, to me, to empower apartment owners to kick out anyone who sublets an apartment to noisy guests, and allow legal recourse for the people in surrounding apartments if this does not occur. A system of incentives would thus be created for people renting out a spare room to make sure to educate their visitors about the behavioral standards they are expected to follow, and to enforce these standards. This would create greater freedom for everyone, and the owner of the building has the option of stipulating that short-term sub-letting is not permitted in whatever contract they have with their renters.<p>The problem of actual unlicensed hotels - a set of rooms lived in by no one but short-term renters - is entirely different, and is the problem which should be removed by legislation. It's also the problem which many of the people who are against AirBnB and similar sites are thinking of; there is a world of difference between a group of tourists given free reign in an apartment and one or two tourists renting a bedroom from someone who is living in and present in the apartment. This difference is perhaps why so many of the people who have tried such services are in favor of it; they have been in the latter situation, which seemed quite pleasant to them and which was completely preferable to hotels (all of the stories I've heard of users of such services describe this situation). The people who are angry about it (outside of the hotel industry) without actually coming into contact with it (short-term renting of the adjacent apartment, with whatever results) are thinking of the first situation.<p>Or at least, that seems to be the case, from reading many of the comments on this article. It's quite likely that I'm misunderstanding something, of course.",1280114968

If you present a buyer with well-justified and thought-out reasons for your number, it's going to be hard for them to counter-offer with something ridiculous, unless they're just being an ass.  Not to mention you should always have your base number in mind, at which point you just walk away.  The OP also said the company has agreed with most of his initial estimations, so he's clearly in a better position with regards to the number he can ask.<p>In my deals, I usually take $Well-Justified-Price and then tack on $Extra to swing the deal far in my favor.  Usually $Extra brings the price close to where I think the buyer would walk away.  Then it's up to the buyer to do their due diligence and we can talk about the facts behind the number and do our negotiating there.  Usually it comes down, but that's the point of inflating your own value first.<p>Regardless, I've done this for selling my Facebook apps, vehicles, negotiating job salary, etc.  If a buyer is pulling lowball crap, you basically tell them to cut the BS, reiterate the facts behind the number and make a call-to-action (i.e. ""Buyer, you know everything behind this number is legit, now let's come to agreement"").  If not, you walk away, simple as that.<p>Sometimes the buyer does have legitimate sticking points though, and that's usually where you just have to listen and go into ""understanding"" mode to get to the root of their concerns.  Once you hear them out, you cut them a little slack on the price and then again reiterate all the facts behind what you're giving them (ABC - Always Be Closing)... When you present someone with solid facts, they can't help but agree with you, so it helps to get that final ""Yes"" when you ask them to close with you.<p>For the OP, you really need to do your research and come up with a solid justification for a number you have in your head.  Drew gave one example of revenue * X, which is what I used when I sold one of my Facebook apps.  If you're adding $$$ to their bottom line, then use that to make your argument also.  This is a flexible process and depends greatly on industry.  For websites it can often just be Drew's formula.  Regardless, make sure there's at least some ""science"" behind your wild-ass-guess, and that way it'll at least look like you put in the work to come up with a legitimate price.<p>To be honest though, that's the fun of deals... it's really a flexible process and there's a ton of learning involved, so have fun with it. Don't be afraid to ask for something inflated though, so long as it's well justified and not pulled from your rear.  After that it's the buyer's responsibility to negotiate down.",1280113496
