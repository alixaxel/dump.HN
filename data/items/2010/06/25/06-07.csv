Word of mouth doesn't hurt recent Apple products. The Gizmodo ""leaks"" were word of mouth about this particular phone and Apple sold 1,000,000 phones today.<p>If you will think back a few months, ""word of mouth"" was that the 27-inch iMac had screen problems. That ""word of mouth"" amounted to thousands of posts on the Apple support site. Apple simply fixed/replaced the machines with problems, improving their reputation as a make-good company. I haven't heard any ""word of mouth"" about the iMac lately because the customers are satisfied and the FUD has evaporated.<p>When these iPhone problems are resolved, this entire thread will dry up and blow away in the wind.",1277448041

But we've spent the last eight years training half a billion people (literally) to use tabs below the address bar. Now most of them have internalized that model and think of as natural, or (much more likely) don't think about it at all but are used to it anyways and will be annoyed if it changes.<p><i>(Remember the story about Stuart Feldman in the 1970s when someone asked him to fix annoyances with Makefile parsing? He said it was too late to change the syntax, because Make already had more than a dozen users!)</i><p>Mozilla has been debating this for so long because there are good reasons not to change an existing product. Upgrading is more hassle for users when more has changed.  Changes to the main UI are the worst.<p>But users are much more forgiving when adopting a new product like Chrome (not least because the change is less likely to be forced on them). And now that Chrome is so popular, we can point to it as strong evidence that tabs-on-top is a reasonable default that people will be happy to use.<p>Of course, Firefox still couldn't get away with it without the option to switch back to the old style...",1277447315

Still, you could probably get a spare set of keycaps or just a cheap keyboard and write the glyphs on there with Sharpie for the time it took you to learn.<p>Still, it's kinda neat.<p>Also, opening saved APL files and displaying them correctly (with the modern Unicode equivalents) is probably a good test for anyone writing an editor these days.  I assume it must have used its own high-ASCII codepage to store the uncommon characters.",1277446282
