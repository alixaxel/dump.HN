1396630,comment,1396428,1396589,0,0,MrRage,,,"> Having held an HTC Hero and an iPhone, I'm here to say that they're not wrong. Those cameras suck  as cameras.<p>I disagree. There are two sayings about photography I've heard a few times. 1) The best camera is the one that you have with you. 2) The novice photographer wishes he/she had a better camera, but the experienced photograph wishes he/she had better lighting.<p>Re #1, I have a high end point and shoot that's really nice. But I almost never use it now because my iPhone 3GS is always with me. I find that some of the best photograph opportunities come when you least expect it.<p>Re: #2, most of photography is lighting and and composition. If you have crappy light (that includes using a flash) it doesn't matter if you have some $10,000 camera and lens. If you take photos with good light and have an eye for composition it won't matter to much which camera you use.<p>Now saying that, some phone cameras really do lack in resolution. My iPhone 3GS has decent resolution, but iPhones before that take washed out looking photos. Of course there's other limitations like no zoom, you can't print out a huge poster version of your photos, and it can't do more ""advaced"" things like long exposures. But I and many others have taken decent looking photos on iPhones. It's Good Enough.<p>Edit: One more thing. I like the challenge of taking photos on a simple camera. You don't get distracted by messing with features and have to kinda learn what makes a photo good.",1275439569

Oh, and Bing. Bing is actually great. That's not to say they're going to be successful, but they've definitely been innovating in recent years.

That said...]<p>> <i>Optics is, more or less, a solved problem. We hit hard physical limits long ago.</i><p>This is only true for cameras which are designed around a principle of light passing through a “generalized pinhole” (i.e. go through a lens and are collected as a two-dimensional image in a single frame at the back, without doing any fancy math; the kind of set-up required by, for instance, a process based around film or our current types of digital sensors).<p>Look to biology though for inspiration and it quickly becomes clear that visual information can be captured in all kinds of ways, with all kind of crazy “eye” designs.<p>There’s a huge amount of information stored in the light rays passing through a camera which is currently not captured, and the cameras of a few decades from now will blast through all of those “hard physical limits”. We’re going to get much better approximations of actual light spectra coming in, along with information about polarization and distance to the subject; simulate any lens, any aperture, any focal length in software because all of the relevant data will be captured. (In my dreams, anyway, or even maybe my somewhat-informed guesses; we’ll see how well technology actually advances.)<p>Anyway though, our typical current digital cameras don’t even hit the limits given the traditional/obvious camera design approach: for instance, we currently have three different colors of pixels each of which filters out a different set of wavelengths, meaning we are only capturing a “third” of the information we need to make a metameric match from each point, and just tossing out a bunch of the other photons. That right there is worth a something like 2x improvement in data captured per area.<p>One last thing: even before we get crazier camera designs, improvements in computer processing speed are going to make it possible to create high-resolution images out of an image captured over time (i.e. a movie processed into a still): we can see the beginnings of this already with those panoramic cameras I’ve been seeing TV commercials for.",1275437894

And here my thoughts and tips.<p>- First, I don't find it a crazy lifestyle, in fact it changed my life for good. I can manage my schedule, I've no boss, damn I'm my own boss. I can choose who I work with and I get to meet very cool people all around the world. Unlike being stuck in a office, with people that you probably don't even like. Also, I can work in any place in the world, as long as I have a computer + internet connection. Take that you in-house Senior Software Engineer (just kidding)<p>- However, isolation is your worst enemy, you better have friends you can hang out with at the end of the day, or this can really be a very lonely life.<p>Organization, you MUST BE FREAKING organized, you must really know you. You need to record everything, working hours, projects timelines. To-do lists will help you a lot on this. Always create for the next day before you go to bed.<p>Freelancing is great, but there will be times where you will have no projects and no money getting in. So put aside money enough for you to live for at least 4 to 6 month. Have a network of friends who do also freelance, we trade a lot of projects and it's a great help. You can also create a product but just remember that this takes time, and time is money.<p>Forget bidding boards, really, get the hell out of there. Do you really want to value yourself/compete against to some guy who codes for less than $10 an hour ?
Instead, find job boards, contact clients directly, just don't spam anyone.
If you are good at this, look at yourself as a brand, have a a great portfolio, brand yourself, and price yourself for how good you are. You may not get that ""I need a wordpress ninja for custom plugin"", but if you are good at it  you  can get much more reliable clients, and by reliable I include, awesome connections, work, steady projects and cool apps to build.<p>Last but not least...<p>Instead of trying to be a swiss army knife, focus on what you are really good, and apply yourself, and be the best you can. This will be your turning point after awhile, believe me.",1275437826

This brings in more money (in a harder currency), keeps more of that money in the domestic economy, and also allows the government to inflate away some domestic debt as the economy improves by raising interest rates.<p>None of these options are available to euro members, any more than they are to individual US states. So to repair their state balance sheets in a federal monetary environment, they must make politically unpalatable like raising taxes or cutting services, and don't have much flexibility in terms of repricing their external trade. That means pissy voters and a somewhat slower recovery, because trade gains must come from either reductions in base costs or improvements in quality, both of which are harder to realize than to talk about.<p>On the other hand, these latter things represent fundamental economic improvements, whereas currency revaluation is something of a sleight-of-hand that taxes people indirectly and leads to inflation. But for a politician, that's highly preferable to telling the voters that they are likely to get less and pay more. So, less fun and freedom for euro-zone politicians who have to implement austerity programs and persuade their electorate to deal with financial reality, but (in my opinion) better for their economies over the longer term, as they'll make needed reforms while the Czech Republic and Poland only go through the motions of doing so and carry forward their structural problems.<p>Sorry that 'summary' is so long - not much of a time saving :-/",1275437429
