1428535,comment,1428040,1428040,0,0,waivej,,,"AWS is a bit more expensive but can be cheaper if you use the right size or number of machines.  For example, run 25 machines during the day and less at night rather than buying enough hardware to meet peak demand.<p>Though there are some cool extras that come with AWS such as the ability to add EBS volumes, take S3 snapshots, etc.  This can give you options that VPS or dedicated don't.<p>But a VPS is basically the same thing.  I suggest you test out ""cloud"" instances and see how much load they support and then compare comparable hosting plans at various places based on cost and reliability.<p>We host 200 sites on a machine similar to an AWS small with more processor (2g ram with tons more processor - about 11 compute units but rarely hit 25%)  Though io is 3-4 times as fast. Some of the sites are pretty active.  If you just have a single small site, it would be way more than you need at this stage.  Though a VPS would be great because you can get a feeling for how much power you need.<p>I've considered ""cloudsites"" from Rackspace but based on page loads, I think it would cost $450/month.  That's a bit more expensive than running powerful collocated hardware...but nice since they manage it.  It would be fun because they track your machine usage so you are motivated to write efficient code.  Though I think it starts at $150.",1276476702

1428523,comment,1427870,1427870,0,0,wglb,,,"Ages ago, as a contractor for a BFE, in the early days of the internet there, I wrote something like this for a very specific purpose.  We were tasked with identifying ""non business-appropriate activity"". Make of that what you will.  So I wrote a c++ program to pull the logs apart and generate a static web page with findings.<p>First, I looked for triple X anywhere in the URL.  Then, from the workstations that referred to those, I found other interesting words in the URLs (a pivot of sorts there).  By the end of the week, I could not read the word list over the phone without running foul of the indecency laws.<p>It was an effective effort, and ultimately they installed some blocking software whose site blocks were updated frequently.<p>Further, there seemed to be a lot of tools out there, but tilted to the analytical side of things with pretty graphs.<p>That work was property of where I was engaged, but there was nothing particularly difficult about that.<p>Were I to do this today, I would likely use Lisp and if the set was truly huge, consider getting the Franz triples software to help manage access.<p>This software would take into account time drift, either by synchronizing of a known event, or my manual input for each file or server.<p>I don't see the parsing differences as much of a problem.  They should be relatively self-identifying.<p>The fun part, as you note, is that you don't know quite what you are looking for, so you need to be able to easily pivot on something that you don't know until you see it, and to be able to spot patterns over long periods of time.<p>But this was ages ago, so I would be astonished if this doesn't exist in some form already.  Fun project.<p>As an aside, what was not funny was seeing what some of the URLs were--some were bad enough to turn your stomach.  That is without looking at the site.<p>The funny part was noticing repeat visits, kind of nullifying what I imagined to be the ""banana peel"" defense.",1276476247

Simply believing in doing good things for no reason is illogical, and not much different than the reasoning in having blind faith in religion. And even if you have no problems simply doing good for no reason at all, there will be others who cannot latch on to that reasoning, and thus <i>karma</i> is a <i>practical</i> reason for doing good that <i>everyone</i> can latch on to.<p>Think butterfly effect. That's what karma is. You do something nice it WILL have an effect, even if really small. However these small things will add up. If you're an asshole, I don't care how smart you are, given time = infinity you won't be able to keep it up forever, and the longer you persist the harder it will be to maintain your ass-holeness without retribution. You do something nice to someone else they will be nicer. And if you reason it out, then if you do nice things to everyone, and everyone you do nice things to does the same thing, then it will exponentially spread. It will counteract the people who spread bad things in the same way. But eventually it comes back to you right?",1276476077

Now ink (computer printing) is cheap, but that is no reason at all to start reducing the data-ink ratio. It is a reason to look even harder at the practices of the past that used ink most efficiently. Mainly because that efficient use of ink almost universally leads to more data in the eye-span, which inherently leads to better thinking.<p>Maintaining a high data-ink ratio is probably Tufte's greatest explicit contribution to design.
