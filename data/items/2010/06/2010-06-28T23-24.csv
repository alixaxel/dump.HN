In all honesty, despite what the USPTO might have you think, nobody can own an idea. Lots and lots and lots of people have been independently coming up with about the same exact ideas for centuries. The trick is execution, and timing, and luck, and polish, and firing on all (or enough anyway) cylinders. I have dozens of notebooks full of ideas --- sitting on a shelf, and therefore worthless. There's a very very high likelihood that there is somebody already out there executing on the same idea as you are now. They might be a little ahead or behind, or a little different in various ways, and you will never escape that contextual reality.

Abstract taken from <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/physics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/alo/www/Papers/physics.html</a><p>The quantitative aspirations of economists and financial analysts have for many years been based on the belief that it should be possible to build models of economic systems—and financial markets in particular—that are as predictive as those in physics. While this perspective has led to a number of important breakthroughs in economics, ""physics envy"" has also created a false sense of mathematical precision in some cases. We speculate on the origins of physics envy, and then describe an alternate perspective of economic behavior based on a new taxonomy of uncertainty. We illustrate the relevance of this taxonomy with two concrete examples: the classical harmonic oscillator with some new twists that make physics look more like economics, and a quantitative equity market-neutral strategy. We conclude by offering a new interpretation of tail events, proposing an ""uncertainty checklist"" with which our taxonomy can be implemented, and considering the role that quants played in the current financial crisis.",1277768954

1469853,comment,1467832,1469401,0,0,Dove,,,"Indeed, this is an aspect of poverty often overlooked: when you have no money, everything is so much harder and more expensive.  You can't just hop in the car and go downtown for the cost of a little gas; you have to do something like dig up bus fare and wait at a stop for two hours.  Tossing a load in the washer instead of hauling it to the laundromat, dishwasher meaning a device rather than a person, buying and storing in bulk because you have an extra freezer.  When you're poor, time and money saving devices like these sure would be nice.  And then there's the neglect of routine car and house maintainence that becomes acute and expensive, doctor's bills when you couldn't even afford insurance, late fees for missed payments, credit cards that hike the rate on you when you become a ""risk"".  Seems only the rich could ever afford to be poor.<p>I don't know much about life on the cheap in the UK (which, from your references to nappies and TV licenses, I gather is where you're from).  It sounds to me like you know what you're doing.<p>Over here (in the US), if someone complained they didn't have enough money to eat healthy, I'd be awfully concerned.  Unless you have an exotic notion of 'healthy' that involves concepts like organic food and complex carbohydrates, it really is pretty cheap to eat healthy.  If you're so poor that you're giving up things like spaghetti, potatoes, rice, beans, carrots, cheese, and milk for ramen, and you've been doing it so long that it's impacting your energy and lifestyle, you're in a really bad way.<p>Over here I'd encourage you to apply for EBT and look at local food banks.  No shame in it.  Helping people avoid that kind of poverty trap is what those programs are <i>there for</i>.<p>There definitely is a level of poverty where the money saved starts to be destructive, and it sounds like you're in it.

1469813,comment,1469632,1469632,0,0,wvenable,,,"The problem with Windows is that there isn't a lot of API for very important system tasks.  Instead, everything is held together by convention -- a DLL copied to the system directory, a registry key, shortcut files, etc.  This has made it much harder for Microsoft to adjust Windows to better handle a much more user-hostile world.  It has also made the software more brittle because they simply aren't forced to follow the convention.<p>For example, installing and uninstalling software is broken in Windows because there's no accounting by the operating system as to what was changed -- if an uninstaller is broken the user is pretty much stuck.  If applications were forced to install themselves completely using a system API, then Windows could track the changes and simply undo them itself.  This could be pretty low-level (it doesn't have to be MSI, for example) but if you want to write a file into the /Programs/ folder, you need to use an API that does just that.  And if Microsoft decides to rename that folder again you are guaranteed that every application will continue to work.<p>This can be equally true of setting file associations, adding desktop/startmenu icons, the notification area, and auto updators.  Applications have been allowed to basically spam your computer with icons and background tasks.  This doesn't necessarily need to be sandboxed out of existence but instead held behind an API that empowers the user.  Mobile operating systems already do much of this by asking you at install/runtime what access an application should have and then providing a system control panel for adjusting this access after the fact.  Wouldn't it be great if there was a control panel that listed every background task started by Windows with the program it belongs to, a description, and the option to turn it off?",1277767712

Right now I'm looking into using Google App Engine and python and these are the best resources I have found:<p>-MIT open courseware offers a FANTASTIC introductory course using python with video lectures which are nice since I get tired of reading 600+ page books.
<a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-comput...</a><p>-Another resource that I found very helpful is a book called Head First Java, I'm not really into Java but the first few chapters give a great overview of Object Oriented programming. I wasn't sure what the difference between a class and object were, and I was unsure about other very basic questions. This book answered all of those questions, and it's written in a very entertaining style.<p>-I'm also reading a book called ""using Google app engine"" also starts from the beginning, and introduces all the technologies that go into Google App Engine. I found that book on gigapedia.org btw.<p>-I tried zed shaw's learn python the hard way book. I've only done the first few examples so I don't have an opinion on it yet. But so far I think it's a good resource for short little exercises to learn your way around python syntax, but I definitely needed more of a programming background which is where all the other resources I mentioned above fill in the gap.<p>by the way i would definitely recommend python over other languages I've looked into because at least as a beginner, python syntax isn't complicated to learn. But if you are interested in learning say Java, there is a Stanford online course that might be good, so just look at their online course offerings.<p>A final python resource which I found was Guido Van Robot where you basically control a robot in a maze using python. I haven't looked at it too closely yet but it seems entertaining and helpful for the beginner. If you're familiar with Karel the Robot, Guido Van Robot is the exact same thing, except using python.

It's mostly a category used to describe sites like Facebook, MySpace, or Loopt (previously Friendster and Orkut) so any site or service resembling those would be social networking. (Please refer here for the type of theory I am applying: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory</a>)<p>So far the most successful of those sites is Facebook; Facebook is difficult to use if one is paranoid about one's privacy. None of the other partial or past successes were successful due to their exceptional concern for privacy. One does not join a site designed for sharing things with other people in order to hide things from other people.",1277766228

This is the very worst sort of change to have to make, because you can't do it automatically, and doing it manually is fraught with opportunities for bugs.<p>Not to mention that the natural pedagogical order will change in several cases that a simple ""translation"" wouldn't reflect.  A lot of CS2 books in Java---especially two or three years ago---spent a lot of time and trouble showing how to build a generic linked list using Object, casts and all, and then as a little addendum, introduced ""generics"" that let you use a specific type.  By translating the book from old Java to Java 1.5 without rewriting it, they were losing pedagogical opportunities and introducing confusion.  Or the CS2 book in Java that used .clone() all over the place: wtf, until you realise that it's been translated from an equivalent C++ book that used copy constructors a lot.  Laaaaame.<p>So yeah, the publisher that treats this as an ""incredibly minor change"" is one whose books you should avoid.",1277766180

If they don't have a budget passed by their June deadline, State workers may get paid in IOUs or simply get paid minimum wage until a budget is passed.  They do get their full back pay once a budget is passed, but the state cannot pay them more than minimum wage until they have a budget.<p>Of course, these days California might belong in the ""about to fail"" group.",1277766173
