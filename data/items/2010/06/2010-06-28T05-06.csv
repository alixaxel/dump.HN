I was the second member of the Palantir Government backend team so I've been with the company almost five years. I've seen this place grow up around me.  To describe me a bullish about this place would be an understatement.  <p>I can categorically confirm that this is not BS: we don't have sales people, we don't have marketing people.  This doesn't mean that we don't have people performing those functions -- of course we do!  However, the people performing those functions are all technical folk who have stepped into the breach to do the needed work to grow our business.  As a commenter in the TechCrunch article mentioned, ""I'm the founder at my startup.  Just because I sweep the floor sometime doesn't mean I'm the janitor.""<p>I think what we said got a little garbled as it was distilled into the TechCrunch article.  When we said, ""we have no sales people"", what was meant was that we don't have people who know nothing about the product, worrying about their commission and their quota and adding essentially zero value to the process. The people who come up with our marketing messages are not people with marketing degrees -- they're engineers who intimately understand our technology and the benefits that it brings to our customers.<p>Even I've stepped up into that role: along with writing our backend data importer and authoring our XML formats and processing pipelines, I also run our college recruiting program, and write for and edit our tech blog .  Does that make me a recruiter or a blogger?  Not in the sense of the word that most people would use it.  I'm an engineer, proud of it and my technical achievements, and anyone who calls me otherwise better do it when I can't hear them. I'm an engineer that does recruiting and blogging, just like we have other engineers that do sales and marketing.<p>I look back over my time here and I marvel at the amazing place that we've built.  It's an engineer's fantasy land that really exists - I can only think that this is what Google was like, circa 2000.<p>But don't just take my word for it, come and check us out for yourself.  Shoot me an email to ari@palantir.com and I'll set up a visit, a proper interview, or whatever is appropriate for your situation.",1277704423

1467201,comment,1466164,1466164,0,0,daylast,,,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news but, based on the comments you've made in your post, you are most likely a smart fool (as you have so aptly put).  In essence, you don't even know what you do not know.  
I've worked at top-tier Wall St institutions and have had first hand experience working with several of the largest quant hedge funds out there.
Here's my advice: if you truly enjoy markets and are sure you want to take this path, you will be much better served by spending several years working at an established quant hedge fund.  This will open your eyes to the theory, processes, data, and techniques required to earn alpha consistently and in a risk efficient manner.  It's a long road and that road is full of extraordinarily hard working and intelligent people that one has to constantly compete against.  If you can handle this though, you will learn a bunch and at some point in the future you can strike out on your own again.  At that point you will at least have a chance of success.
Good luck!",1277704134

Its not like money is my only motivation. I definitely do want to things I enjoy (coding/math/statistics/entrepreneurship) or at least as close to it as possible. I would never compromise that. But to answer your question ""what can you do with $250k that you can't do with $115k?"" -- I have thought about this for a long time. In fact I use this argument to suppress my dissatisfaction of not making enough money. I guess I'm not a content person when it comes to money and I guess I feel it is a measure of career progress and that I'm moving forward rather than being stagnant. Of course I would be kidding myself, if I say its the only measure of progress, there is always the value produced for obtaining that money.",1277704019

1467192,comment,1466539,1466881,0,0,carsonbaker,,,"No, I wouldn't say pricing is fundamentally an infrequent activity, although analyzing the ""idiosyncratic risk"" may well be. That's not all that's going on though. For example, investors in, say AAPL, do not live in a Plato's cave where nothing else but Steve Jobs' latest keynote matters (believe it or not!). There's the rest of the market to consider.<p>In fact, a lot of algorithmic trading is about quickly assessing the value of a company in the context of a larger portfolio. If you accept that the market index can (and should) fluctuate second by second as the world tuns and news gets reported, then you must accept that companies' stocks will be traded alongside it (usually in rough proportion to the amount of liquidity available).<p>Here's how that can work. If you're comparing two stocks that share fundmental drivers, then you can make ""pair trades"" when they fall out of correlation. If Pepsi (PEP) does really well one day and CocaCola (KO) does terribly for no apparent reason, then it may be a good trade to buy KO and sell PEP on the supposition that the stocks have moved out of equilibrium.<p>This is basic arbitrage, and if you extend the practice across all the traded securities you'll find you need some pretty serious computing power. I suspect this accounts for much of the silicon in the basements of banks and hedge funds.<p>Notice that I'm just talking about the pricing function here. You can price a stock all day long and not have to trade on it.<p>And I'll agree that there's way too much volume, churn, and speculation in the market. I'm not sure, but I feel like it's becoming more and more a behavioral system. I wish people and institutions would better understand long-term risk and the costs of commissions and slippage when making investments. If ""managed"" funds became a dirty word, there may be a lot less volatility in the market.",1277703890

We may have very negative views on the industry, but it exists because it serves many fundamental (and necessary) functions, including:<p>* Accuracy in pricing shares (and it is important to know the actual value of a company for many reasons)<p>* Enable market participation. In many illiquid OTC markets, it is all but impossible for anyone outside large institutional players to participate. More trading = lower transaction costs, more transparency, and ability for the little guy (me) to join the action<p>* Liquidity. And yes, this is very important. It is a common answer because it is a good one<p>* The same security can be worth different amounts to different people. By definition this precludes it from being zero sum (this statement is of course subject to what school of financial theory you subscribe to)<p>* Performance measurement.

1467142,comment,1466246,1466953,0,0,blueski,,,"OK so I've looked into this more. From what I understand the difference is:<p>- Appcelerator transforms HTML and JS (built around its own client library) into native apps with native components.<p>- Sencha builds HTML5 sites using CSS3 to mimic native components and behaviors. These sites can potentially be wrapped with Appcelerator (using a Web View), Phone Gap or similar to be submitted to the Apple App Store/Android Market.<p>Looks like the advantage of Appcelerator is the speed and UI consistency of using true native components - and perhaps a greater chance of Apple including it in the App Store since the output (I think) is entirely Objective C. Advantage of Sencha is getting a HTML5 mobile site ""for free"" (if your main aim is to build apps) and in some cases more flexibility since the Appcelerator libraries don't exposure all the native functionality.<p>In my case I want to build something around Maps. The Appcelerator Maps component is just too limited to fit my needs right now so I'll be going down the Sencha route.<p>Hope this is helpful to someone. Let me know if I've missed/misunderstood something along the way.",1277701887
