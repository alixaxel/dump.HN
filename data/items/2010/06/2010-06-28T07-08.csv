I can't imagine what they're all up to now but it doesn't seem to be the modern Web development industry, that's for sure. Were the late 90's ""new media"" bunch really a wackier, more diverse lot than we are now?",1277708648

The article suggests Python and Ruby provide a better n00b experience and that is far from true. For instance, Ruby becomes a nightmare as soon as you start mixing your own gems with gems installed by the packaging system. That situation is hard to avoid, as distros usually only support outdated Rails gems and the n00b  that thinks 'let me just grab the latest stable Rails version from github' is in for some nasty surprises concerning incompatible combinations of gems. We solved this by moving to Enterprise Ruby and keeping <i>everything</i> local and selfcontained, but it is definitely not very n00b-friendly either. With Python I've had similar experiences: when I was in need of a decent XPath library (mind you, this was over 4 years ago), the best one I could find (4Suite) needed to be installed manually, with all the usual problems of missing -dev libs, install paths and whatnot.<p>A summary of the problem is: the configurations people run are so diverse that it is hard to provide installation instructions that work for all, or even most, of them. As soon as someone wants something not covered by the simplest of tutorials, many of them will run into issues.<p>I think the only solution is documentation. The only thing that works is catalogueing all known problems people have encountered, so that others can easily find solutions to those problems. The largest problem of this solution is that n00bs need to understand their systems and they often don't.",1277708641
