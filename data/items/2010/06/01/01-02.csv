1394075,comment,1393132,1393132,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> There's a lot of it about, attacking evolution, global warming, tobacco research, HIV, vaccines - and now, it seems, flu.<p>One thing that seems strange to me - whenever there's one of these pan-denier arguments, the arguer tends to choose topics that the Starbucks crowd would agree with, and nothing that the Starbucks crowd might deny in the face of evidence.<p>For instance, we know really firmly that there's a larger standard deviation in intelligence and success in men than women - men are overrepresented at the top and the bottom. That is, men reach the highest levels of business, science, and leadership more often than women, but also are victims of homicide, suicide, and are incarcerated more often than women. This is thoroughly proven, but even at Harvard the university president lost his job for saying something like this!<p>So how come these ""look at these idiot deniers!"" arguments never look at denial of the fact that men and women have a different hormonal mix, different cognitive mix, and that leads to different patterns of behavior and results. I mean, that's so bloody obvious just from a casual observation of the world, but it's now also proven, at least to a much higher standard than global warming is.<p>Or hell, the New Scientist article uses evolution/creationism - yet a lot of people who believe in evolution reject the fact that natural selection and sexual selection would make groups evolving in different circumstances evolve differently... that comes hand-in-hand with evolution, but people are often deniers about that, thinking that everyone evolved to be the same in all meaningful ways, and any differences in wealth, aggression, preferred behavior, even musical ability must be due to culture. Which is obviously nonsense - but this kind of denial of something obvious is never mentioned in a pan-denier argument, it's always a bunch of mostly proven things with a vocal, ignorant minority, plus global warming.",1275357547

For example, if I'm looking to pick out a library to use for something, I'd like to be able to filter the listings down to just the ones that build on GHC 6.12. Or the ones that have received an update within the last year. Or, for example, filter out packages with explicit parsec-2 dependencies, since I use 3 now.<p>Maybe there could be some kind of 'gold star' that would show up next to the package name in the listing if your package meets a certain number of requirements. Builds on most recent stable release of GHC, no outdated dependencies, no dead link to homepage, has a maintainer. Maybe not those exact requirements, but I think encouraging the community to meet a high bar of compatibility and portability is healthy.<p>Is there a rule against scraping Hackage?

1394034,comment,1393669,1393824,0,0,mdasen,,,"The point of my post wasn't to bring up the issue of how to gauge whether friends will repeat/copy things.  The issue is that Diaspora is bringing in another layer to the mix: third-party service providers.  Right now, with Facebook, I have to judge whether I want to share something with you.  With Diaspora, I'd have to judge whether I want to share something with you and whether I trust your service provider to be a trustworthy go-between.<p>With Facebook, I have to read and agree to a single privacy policy.  With Diaspora, I might have dozens (or more) policies that I'd have to read and track (if I care about privacy).  Diaspora seems to say that I don't have to trust the other service providers.  They're saying it's ""privacy aware, personally controlled"".  They say that their ""current implementations include GPG encryption"".  They say that ""Diaspora knows how to securely share (using GPG) your pictures, videos, and more,"" and that, ""When you have a Diaspora seed of your own, you own your social graph, you have access to your information however you want, whenever you want, and you have full control of your online identity.""<p>But how is that?  I don't expect them to fix the issue of one of my friends using cut and paste.  However, they are claiming that I'm in control of my data.  If other sites are able to decrypt that data, then those other sites will be able to store that data.  How are they getting around that?<p>From my perspective, Diaspora is adding more privacy concerns since I now have to decide whether I trust my friends and my friends' service providers rather than just Facebook and my friends.  It isn't just whether a company is going to be evil.  Sometimes companies accidentally expose data and sometimes companies are breached.<p>Diaspora's grandiose statements seem to promise end-to-end security; that none of the servers between me and my friend will be able to decrypt the data.  They claim that I'm in control of my online identity making it seem like if I delete something off of my Diaspora account on one provider, it will be removed from the feeds on other providers.<p>But I can't see a way that this would work.  If I have a Diaspora server with you as a user and I go to get your friends' status updates from other Diaspora servers, isn't my server going to be able to decrypt that information in order to pass it along to you as text?  You've elected to trust me with your information, but have your friends?  Couldn't I store their status messages against their will?  Couldn't I make them public against their will?<p>What I'm looking for is someone to tell me how Diaspora is going to keep my information private.  Yes, I could decide which service providers to trust and weed my friends based on that, but that isn't the security that Diaspora is claiming.  They're claiming that they're privacy aware, that I'm in control of my data, that it's being securely shared, that I'm in charge of my social graph and online identity.  I just don't see how they're accomplishing it and their site offers no information on how.<p><i>Here's the base issue: I post a status update.  Your service provider has gotten it from mine and put it in your feed.  I delete it.  Does your service provider just voluntarily remove it on their end?  I don't want it there, but there's nothing I can do about it beyond appealing to their good graces.  That isn't putting me in charge.  If I'm to be in charge, when I delete that post, you have no more access to it (unless you used copy/paste or something else) and your service provider no longer has it in their database.  Diaspora hasn't said how they're going to accomplish this.  In fact, deleted posts would be the best thing to data-mine: they're things people don't want shared because they're embarrassing or whatnot.  Think about it, you tag a photo of me and that gets cached by service providers.  I do a remove-tag request on that photo - that's likely a photo I don't want people seeing.  That remove-tag request gets propagated out, but rather than removing the tag, some service providers just put a date_to on the tag, others might just ignore it completely.  I'm not in control of my data there.</i>  How is Diaspora getting around this problem (since they claim to be)?",1275355945

Maximize your efficiency. Get the best workers, ensure they are the best, and ensure the best results given your merchandise. Ok not quite 1:1 but close.<p>Now how to do this on a national level to ensure the best everywhere!!??! I guess the moral of this story that I got is that once the students were properly motivated the flourished, until then nothing good was happening.

They have made it so simple to set up a new business using Google apps that it's almost unthinkable to me that I would go out and do an exchange setup.    But this is largely still in stealth mode because Google wants to bring its business apps up to the point where they are a alternative to Office for real tasks before they really play this hand.  And that means they have to force their employees to live on them every day, for everything.  If they can't do it, how can they expect their customers to?  And the best way to make it happen is to take away Windows entirely.  Otherwise people will continue to fall back to Office and find reasons to sneak it onto their computers.</speculation>",1275354820

Perl seems more popular than Ruby, everyone uses Windows, OS X, or Linux, and so on.<p>I think the appeal of the iPhone is that it is marketed like a luxury good rather than a commodity, like the Japanese-made cell phones are.  The Apple Store in Tokyo is in the super-ritzy Ginza district, after all.  (Although the same is true in the US; the Apple Stores are always in the high-end retail districts, and the iPhone is a luxury where its competitors are faceless commodities that you ""pay"" ninety nine cents for every two years.)<p>Another thing I see going for Apple is that, it seems, people in Japan are actually willing to pay for consumer electronics.  In the US, we go for whatever's cheapest (go to Best Buy sometime, not a high-end item in sight), but the Japanese seem to be more discerning.  At least in my experience.<p>(I am typing this on a Y30,000 keyboard that was imported from Japan.
