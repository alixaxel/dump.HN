Our store owner seemed to be enjoy being a test-bed for new products or concepts that actually made it out of the labs.<p>Some things our store did while I was there:<p>* Fried Chicken.  Yup, McDonalds fried chicken.  We installed this huge vat in the back of the store and boxed up greasy fried chicken.  And it sold pretty well.<p>* Home delivery.  I'm not kidding, we actually implemented a home delivery concept where the customer would call in an order to some call center, and out popped an order on a special printer in the store.  Someone would box up the order, and drive it over to the customers house.  It was a pain in the butt from a resource scheduling perspective, but a wonderful thing for the hamburger-flippers (tips, and 15 minutes away from the store in the car)",1275411567

To the contrary, if you're able to search vast amounts of content for what is most interesting to you, the value you receive from that content increases with the size of the search space. It's a clear win for the audience.<p>But what about the content producers? Already, most ""real book"" authors don't publish to get rich from royalties, and derive most of their value in the form of personal and professional publicity they receive from their work. If the acquisition of such publicity shifts from big corporate publishing houses who have the business deals in place to get you on The Daily Show to something more democratic, authors benefit from an increasingly meritocratic system, as well.",1275411473

1395494,comment,1393768,1393952,0,0,tptacek,,,"No. In fact, the incentive for attackers is exactly the inverse of what you claim it is. The author of WinAPI malware can expect multiple tens of conversions for every one obtained by Mac malware. That's because, breathless accounts in the media aside, malware infections don't compete in any practical sense. You would need to deliberately eschew all financial incentives to target OSX. The logic here is exactly the same and exactly as simple as Joel Spolsky's article about investing in OSX dev from 2002.<p>As for the rest of your comment: both Windows and OS X are conventional monolithic operating systems written in C with core facilities designed and built in the '90s. Both are multiuser operating systems repurposed for single-user deployments. Both have strong kernel/userland barriers with well-defined interfaces. In fact, if you've done systems programming on both, they simply aren't all that different, even to a software developer.<p>But: for the past 10 years, Microsoft has been getting <i>hammered</i> by attackers, and has the benefit of a decade-long trial by fire. So when Microsoft randomizes library offsets, they don't (for instance) miss the entire runtime loading subsystem.<p>Also: most of Microsoft's most sensitive application code is written in C for WinAPI on x86, which is one of the best-understood application runtimes in the world. Much of OS X runs on cross-platform Objective C, which has received nowhere nearly as much research. Put simply: nobody knows how to write exploit countermeasures for OS X. I think mostly because nobody cares.<p>(Again: I say this as a Unix dev from '93 at a company standardized on Macs).",1275411245

They are saying ""show me sushi stockholm"" which google interprets as ""show me sushi in stockholm"" and as far as google knows (and accurately as far as I'm concerned when I use google), any sort of searches explicitly limited to a known geographic area are best answered by a map of that area with search results shown on top of it. If you search for ""getting sushi in stockholm"" you don't get a map. The language that triggers a map as the first result is very specific and not limited to google. Individuals may find that they don't like the map as the first result for some queries, but as a company every major search engine as decided this is the best way to present certain results. Rail against it as a website owner or user all you want, but it is absolutely a legitimate practice.<p>Of course it is possible to have better results for certain queries. Is it even remotely plausible for google to reliably decide that? To my knowledge, not without solving some very difficult problems, which they may or may not have any motivation to do, but they are certainly under no obligation to do it either.",1275411224

I can copy/cut stuff onto it that I may need at some indefinite point in the future.  I don't have to spend time deliberating whether to keep a record of it; if I need it, it's there.  I can copy a subsequent item without worrying about losing the current clipboard contents.
