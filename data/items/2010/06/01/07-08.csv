So the general loses everytime.<p>One of general's stratagy advisor[2] came up with an idea: Use general's worst horse to race's King's best horse and lose for round one, then use the best horse to beat King's average horse in round two, next use the average horse to beat King's worst horse in the final round. So at last the general wins.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(state)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qi_(state)</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Bin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Bin</a>",1275379094

But ""Freedom"" lies in the effective ability to use it.

As someone who has not read the blog before, and who did hear about the Google/WiFi thing before today, it made me want to close the tab out of disgust. That is a bit more than a little bit of hurt credibility, I think. For someone to rail against Google for their hypocrisy, it's a terrible shame that he has to bend and distort the facts to this degree to do so - and he ends up hurting his case more than he helps it.<p>""Snooping"" in any colloquial use implies intent. I'm pretty sure we can't get away from that, and perhaps I'm being less charitable than I should be, but I think this implication is exactly what the author was going for.<p>After all, saying that Google actively intended to spy on WiFi users would be an outright lie, yet implications are okay?",1275379045

A bottle of Tsingtao is 10RMB. A pack of cigarettes is 10RMB. A 10 minute cab ride is 20RMB.<p>A Chinese teenager can expect to spend 80RMB on a weekend, doing nothing but taking the train to visit friends, having dinner and two pints of beer and a pack of cigarettes. 26% of their weekly income for 2-3 hours of R&R.<p>For comparison, an American teenager with a full time job, making minimum wage at $7.25 earns $7.25x8x5 = $290/wk. Dinner + beer + bus + cigs + movie ~= 10 + 6 + 8 + 4 + 10 = $38. Or only 13% of their weekly income on R&R, half of what a Chinese boy or girl spends, and I threw in a free movie experience at the cinema, something that would break any Chinese teen's budget.",1275375651
