And I found the brief demonstrations / explanations / visualizations to be terse, accurate, and quite explanatory - near perfect.  <i>Not</i> a book you can casually peruse, it's largely a <i>list of algorithms</i>, though it appears to go roughly in order and build off itself.  Where necessary, it goes into a fair bit of detail (sometimes several pages), but truly most of the code is pretty self-explanatory once you know the purpose.<p>Not a book to skim through, but definitely valuable.  Uses C/C++ (minimal C++ functionality, classes + templates) heavily, of course, but big shocker there given that it's largely focused on efficient, low-level code.  I'd rather have functional C than questionable pseudo-code anyway.  A little of a language called GP and a little pseudocode, but very little from a quick skim.  My main criticism here is that the variable names could be more descriptive, often just a single character or two, but most of the code is small enough that it doesn't matter, you can do it in your head easily enough.<p>Definitely a keeper, IMO, unless you despise C.<p>Disclaimer: I write as little code that looks like this as possible, and have not examined it in detail.

This is what Weissman refers to as a ""Problem/Solution"" story in ""Presenting to Win"".<p>This is all well and good, as a hammer without a nail is not much use to anybody, but someone with an actual bleeding neck wound will tell you (if they had the mental clarity) that they are not too concerned about tomorrow, next week, or next year - all consciousness is wrapped up around solving the (admittedly very important!) problem at hand.<p>The issue is that the scene fixates on this form of storytelling to the exclusion of all others. I was trying to make this point to a member of the Toronto business community the other day by rhetorically asking what bleeding neck wound the iPad solved; the person told me with a straight face that mobile device screens were too small and that laptops were too heavy.<p>The ""build it and they will come"" visionary thinking that brought about order-of-magnitude improvements in the way things are done (the automobile, the personal computer, the Internet) is simply, and sorely, lacking in Toronto.",1275770261

Regardless of how many history books you may read, for example, it will not shed the same insight as a profound discussion with a highly-experienced academic in the field. This is true for many aspects of the humanities.<p>Also, if you're really interested in a subject, talking with an expert is <i>fun</i>.

Not, Lopp said, ""seven in order to make three look good"", which seems to be a fairly standard practice elsewhere. They'll take ten, and give themselves room to design without restriction. Later they whittle that number to three, spend more months on those three and then finally end up with one strong decision.</i><p>[Source: <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2008/03/apples_design_process.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/200...</a>]",1275768059
