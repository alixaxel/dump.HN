In contrast, there appears to be no consistency in the output for whois queries, making them infuriatingly difficult to parse reliably.<p>While not the most accurate way, in my own efforts brute-forcing of DNS name space (I was checking every word in my local /usr/share/dict/words file for possible free domain names), I have found that simple DNS queries are relatively effective and don't raise eyebrows, especially if you use your own name server.  Plus, they're much faster than whois queries.  Usually resolving domain.tld and www.domain.tld  will tell you if the name has been registered with fair accuracy.  As an added bonus, you don't have to worry about someone using whois queries to park/squat interesting domains.",1275616689

As part of a system though, like a challenge/response system,  it's important both ends of the system know how to interpret the data they are dealing with - so this is important.<p>At that point, defining the fact that you are sending a big-endian 64-bit integer  It might seem trivial now that we write everything in Java, but endianness caused <i>all kinds</i> of portability problems in the early internet days when we started making different systems talk to each other, and made simple porting jobs difficult.

My wife and I are planning on relocating some time in the next year, probably to the Seattle area. As part of this I've already started to take a look at what jobs are available and just yesterday I came across your craigslist postings. While having spent the last three years working for a marketing company and dealing with some sleazy SEO people I would have normally just bypassed any ad with SEO anywhere in it, but seeing that it was seomoz I actually took the time to read it.<p>You are probably fighting an uphill battle. Last year I had to do a technical integration with another company and it turned out they were actively paying something like $30k per month to an SEO company to keep them in the top five results on the big three search engines. All of that money was going to black hat methods such as link farms, paid links, cloaking etc. These tactics were all working and for a very long time their sites were the number one and two links for dozens of relevant terms with the big search engines. As those tactics worked, my employer very much wanted us to start employing them, ignoring the objections of the design and engineering team. About six months later we were heavily involved in a project for another company that was supposedly run by an SEO expert. His expertise turned out to be having read a three year old E-book on the topic. While I've provided two anecdotal examples, from everyone I've talked to these types of examples seem to be the most prevalent. Or maybe people only talk about their negative SEO experiences. It's not even cut and dry for those companies that appear to be doing things right. Look at some of the backlash on reddit when people figured out that oatmeal used to work at seomoz.",1275614313
