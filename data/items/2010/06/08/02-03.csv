It says they can write code that does X.  I've never been a part of or seen a job where the only real skills needed were syntax knowledge and basic familiarity with common algorithms.  There's things like interpreting requirements, time/task/priority management, bug diagnosis, impact assessment, domain knowledge.  How do you quantify ""Can figure out why we keep getting kernel panics after the kernel upgrade on only some machines?  Oh, the thing the machines have in common are they are the multi-core/multi-processor boxes.  Is it a bug in our code or the kernel?  Are they still acceptable for the position if they can't identify the problem, but can identify that rolling the kernel back is a viable short-term alternative?""<p>The ideal scenario is the applicant mashes a button and gets a list of job they're truly qualified and a good fit for (as in, highly likely to get a phone screen on) and the hiring company can mash the same button.  Everyone keeps trying to find new ways to invent or improve the button.  No filter or screen is going to work until companies can definitively measure the quality of applicants between two postings for the same job (e.g., A/B test job position listings) and candidates determine if they are qualified based on that.<p>There's a lot of problems to solve, but the biggest by far is the fact that 90% of the jobs out there have only ""can breath, assistance to breath is ok"" and ""can show up"" as the hard skills that are required.

1412816,comment,1412650,1412650,0,0,snikolov,,,"I have a feeling that the variability is at least partially modulated by factors such as (lack of) encouragement and gender bias.  Imagine a spinning flywheel (this is a terrible analogy but I think it will illustrate my point) with particles on it that jump off the edge at random velocities.  The added velocity of the flywheel eventually makes them end up at a certain radial distance on the ground.  Regardless of the speed at which the flywheel spins, the average position of the particles on the ground will be at the center of the flywheel.  But if the flywheel is spinning fast, the variability will be greater than if it is spinning slowly.<p>I think in a similar way, encouragement  and bias -- like the speed of the flywheel -- can account for this variability, rather than intrinsic differences in the capacity for mathematical reasoning.<p>That said, it is interesting why the gap seemed to bottom out at 4 to 1 despite supposed programs to encourage young women to go into mathematics and science.",1275965144

1412809,comment,1412781,1412781,0,0,pedalpete,,,"There are many reasons companies by start-ups, and start-ups need to be aware of what they are offering or could offer to be a good acquisition target.<p>1) purchasing the team - I'd put friendfeed and summize in this category. Facebook could have built a friendfeed quite easily, and twitter could have built a tool to search their own databases. Both companies decided to acquire an outside company who had already done a great job and got traction in the space. If you look at the structure of Facebook these days, it seems that friendfeed founders are having a huge impact on the company. Also summize was absorbed into twitter, and I'm very surprised to see that FriendFeed still exists independently.<p>2) Technology/Patents - Apple purchasing PA Semi and HP purchasing Palm are both likely to be considered purchasing of technology which may or may not include patents (though I assume patented technologies increase the valuation of the acquired companies). HP wasn't in the business of developing an operating system from scratch, and Palm had already done that AND had a large number of valuable patents. Likewise, Apple wasn't going to start-designing chips from scratch, so they looked for a company that already had what they needed or had some of the technologies and purchased them. \nThis isn't to say that these companies don't also benefit from the people who are current employees of the acquired company, but as we've seen with some of the departures from Palm since being acquired by HP, there is no guarantee the most valuable employees will stick around.<p>Cheap innovation - as you say 'being a big company gets in the way'. Yes, start-ups can be a cheaper alternative to home-grown innovation. But the start-up needs to offer something competitive and depending on the market, may need to have market penetration. I'd say this is kinda the Yahoo! model of a few years ago when they were snapping up many start-ups and maintaining many separate brands (flickr, etc.).<p>Looking at the above methods, I'd  suggest that there is likely a bit of each in each good acquisition. Take Mint as an example. Intuit purchased Mint.com for $170 million, and instantly got a great and innovative product (#3), that likely has very good technology (#2 I'm not sure of their patents or technology, so I could be wrong), and put the Mint founder Aaron Patzer as the VP and GM of Personal Finance at Intuit.<p>I'm sure there are other reasons, but those are the top 3 that I think of.",1275964925

Is changing your accent like learning a language, or isn't it?  If it isn't, why are you talking about studies regarding language learning?<p>Anyway, as for this age of 13 business, I've met a number of people who came to the US as late teenagers to early 20's and learned to speak West-coast American English flawlessly.

You're reading judgment into my words again.<p>> If you're confused by the fact that people tend to interpret things in this way, then I feel sorry for you.<p>The only things here that confuse me are 1) why you insist on misconstruing my statements repeatedly and 2) why you want to randomly start arguing about language learning after you said it's irrelevant to accents.",1275963834

It would be awesome if you downgraded the germ theory of disease to a kooky religious superstition.<p><i>I studied political-science at Yale, and the professors are in their own world. Their studies had little to relation to the real world of politics, which I had learned about from actually working in Congress.</i><p>So, you chose poorly when it came to grad school. Then you inferred that all grad schools suffered the same problems at the institution you poorly selected. Is that right?<p>Your description of academia does not jive with the academic writings I read at Lawyers, Guns and Money or the Duck of Minerva or the Edge of the American West. Those academics seem pretty realistic. I have not been blown away by the knowledge, let alone the honesty of congressmen and their staff.<p><i>There is no question that the Revolution was followed by a great deal of bad government, political corruption, sectional strife, coarseness in manners, hostility to the arts and refinements of life, assassination, lynch law, and other things which horrified Englishmen and afforded the stock material for the ridicule of such writers as Dickens and Mrs. Montagu.</i><p>Um, are we to believe that before the revolution, there was no corruption in the entire British Empire? No bad government? No coarseness of manners? No assassination? I suppose the British Empire was a very polite place. Unless you were Irish. Or Indian. Or Chinese. Then you'd be exterminated by very very polite British monarchists. But that's OK, their manners were impeccable, and in the end, isn't that what really matters?<p>Honestly, do you have anything beyond royalist propaganda?<p><i>It happens most in autocracies that came to a power as a result of party politics, or a violent struggle between political parties.</i><p>Really? I think the number of autocracies that have their genesis in military coups shows otherwise.<p><i>Elections are the poison, tyranny and civil war are the disease. It's extremely rare in history to find a demagogue monarch.</i><p>So Emperor Hirohito is the one exception? As is Ghengis Kahn? And why are we limiting ourselves to monarchs?

The best tools to facilitate demagogy only arrived in an era where monarchism declined.<p><i>If you already have a government that provides rule of law, and a good set of norms about power sharing, why change things up?</i><p>Because an embryonic state that is developing the rule of law might not be as sustainable as a mature democracy.
