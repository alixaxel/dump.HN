I suppose it's no great revelation that some prefer Ruby syntax to Clojure's.  However, I can say that Clojure works hard to reduce the number of parens that you might find in similar Lisp or Scheme code.  For example, the `let` form in Common Lisp looks like:<p><pre><code>    (let ((a 10) (b 20)) (* a b))
</code></pre>
After many years using CL in school I can sympathize with the idea that Lisp is full of parens.  Common Lisp's `let` is nicely delineated and is easy to reason about... for macro writers.  Experienced Lisp users don't blink an eye at this.  However, Clojure takes a different approach:<p><pre><code>    (let [a 10, b 20] (* a b))
</code></pre>
There are still parens, but they've been reduced leading to (IMO mind you) a cleaner look.  Our opinions clearly differ on aesthetics, but I think it's worth noting that Clojure libraries will strive for the latter over the former.",1276133684

First, SpaceX is a relatively new company which lacks the engineering legacy of Delta I-IV to build on. That they managed to launch the Falcon 9 on day 1 is nothing short of astounding.  Scaling and legacy will reduce costs which he conveniently ignores.<p>Secondly, he claims that the $1.6B NASA COTS contract is more than the stated launch price.  While it is true that a Delta IV launch is similar to the cost of NASA's launch configuration, we must remember that its different LAUNCH CONFIGURATIONS.  Delta IV just shoves a satellite into orbit.  Falcon 9 must dock with the ISS which is a different can of worms. A more proper comparison would be Falcon 9 with Constellation which is horrendously expensive to operate and over development budget.<p>This is before he degenerates into truly unforgivable pile of FUD, asking why couldn't ""SpaceX obtain a contract from either a commercial or governmental entity for the development of the Falcon 1?  Where are the private investors?  It could be perhaps that there is no market.""<p>Quite frankly, that's a load of disingenuous BS that does nothing more than to point to the author's lack of research.<p>One of the principles SpaceX was predicated on was the private development of rockets, not the cost-plus model the author assumes.  Besides Musk himself, they got John Doerr and several other big name VCs.  The fact that SpaceX was develop rockets with just private money is a sign of strength, not weakness.<p>Another nice bit of artifice on the author's part is his loudly wondering where the launch market is.  Looking at their launch manifest, they already have over 25 launches lined up. It will much more once the company has matured.<p>Long story short: this author is full of shit.",1276133212

A lot of free apps depend on AdMob to make money. Without AdMob, those apps will die, and that will be bad for Apple. So, there is no way Apple will kill AdMob.",1276132280
