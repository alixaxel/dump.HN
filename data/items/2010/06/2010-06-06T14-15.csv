In '98, many investors were MBAs who were willing to take VC investment on so-so terms because they wanted to eventually become VCs and they valued the connections. In '10, they want to take a lot less money (because they need less) on much better terms, and VC still hasn't adapted to that change.<p>But I cannot understate the value of having seasoned, risk-accepting, wanting-to-change-the-world investors and entrepreneurs.
