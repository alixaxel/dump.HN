1424894,comment,1424488,1424800,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"No, that solution requires that the client be able to accept gzip encoding. The problem is, the server needs to be able to read the incoming HTTP request to see if ""gzip"" is contained in the HTTP:Accept-encoding header and only serve the gzipped version if the answer is YES (and otherwise serve the non-gzipped version). Apache and most other servers do this easily. Amazon S3 and CloudFront do not.<p>That article ignores this fact, and just always serves the gzipped version with the gzip header encoding, whether the client accepts it or not. This works for probably 90-95% of the time (or more), but for anyone with a non-trivial app, that's not good enough.",1276293402

1424878,comment,1424805,1424805,0,0,byoung2,,,"<i>I'm European. I have never been in the U.S</i><p>That's Nokia's problem as well.  The cell-phone market in the US is much different from Europe and the rest of the world.  It is my understanding that in Europe and the rest of the world people by phones (usually in cash) and service separately (often prepaid), so cell phone makers have only one customer to please: the end user.<p>In the US, where we are addicted to credit, people buy phones primarily through the cell phone provider for a big discount in exchange for signing a 1 or 2 year contract.  Since the selection of phones drives the profit for the cell phone provider (See AT&T and the iPhone for an example), the phone company has a huge stake in making sure the phones fit their image.  So the cell phone maker has 2 customers - the phone company and the end user.  Every carrier has a signature phone: AT&T - iPhone, Verizon - Droid, Sprint - EVO 4G.  These phones become almost synonymous with the carrier, and less with the brand (iPhone being the big exception).<p>Nokia's problem for the last decade is that they have been used to pleasing only the end user, that they have not been able to win over the American cell phone providers.  A good example is the late 90's, where Americans had moved on to flip phones, but Nokia was still pushing brick/candy bar phones.  They are starting to innovate, but they still haven't captured the heart of the American cell phone buyer.<p>The other hurdle for Nokia is CDMA.  I'm not sure if they have CDMA versions of their phones (this is probably because they'd have to work with Sprint and Verizon to do so).  They'd have to retool most of their phones to work in the US, which might not be worth it if the cell phone companies aren't on board.",1276292957
1424877,comment,1424360,1424820,0,0,KennethMyers,,,"You're totally right. As a matter of fact, in undergrad I had a professor (Dr. Robert? Hard) who found even more correlates, some of them environmental, and plugged them into a GIS that would highlight good candidate sites for archaeological digs. Amazingly, he would go to these places, and often find important sites. Foremost among these was Cerro Juanaqueña, where Dr. Hard (at least a decade ago) earned the distinction of finding the oldest use of corn north of Mexico.<p>So yes, there comes a tipping point where agriculture becomes the most attractive option, and when that happens, humans begin the sequence that causes them to lose a few important things and gain a lot of great things.<p>And strangely, it looks like we're getting some of the things we lost back.",1276292945

Discovery is also a problem if this becomes an open standard.<p>Setting up an open SparkleShare server that can bridge traffic between two NAT'ed clients might be able to solve the problem.  It'd be a plus if there was a way to take the bridging server out of the loop once data transfer starts (I don't know if that's technically possible though).  The same SparkleShare server could be a default discovery server for new users, so they get a ""it just works"" experience (e.g., run the setup on two machines, with the same login credentials they find each other through the discovery server).<p>Designed correctly, the server-less and the hosted scenario should function the same - in a hosted scenario you just happen to always have one client online.",1276292841

It'd be great if remote users could ""subscribe"" to some of the folders, so they could work with files more quickly and offline.

Let me quote you:<p><pre><code>    Where I part ways with mathematicians is the intuition\n    we should ascribe to Cantor's argument.  They say that\n    ""almost all"" real numbers are irrational.\n</code></pre>\nAs you know, that claim does not arise from Cantor's argument at all, it comes from measure theory.  Cantor's argument about the uncountability of the reals (or of the set of subsets of a countable set, or the fact that the power set is always strictly bigger) says nothing about ""almost all.""<p>If you want to talk about ""almost all"" then you have to go to measure theory.<p>Having said that, certainly if you color all the rationals red, and all the irrationals blue, then there are more blue than reds, and the amount by which it's more is a lot.<p><pre><code>    What Cantor's argument says is that ""at least one"" is\n    irrational.\n</code></pre>\nNo.  Cantor's argument says that for every countable set of reals, at least one is missing.  Cantor's argument actually says nothing about rationals or irrationals.<p><pre><code>    I know the arguments about measure and probability and\n    such,\n</code></pre>\nOK - I'll take that as a true statement.<p><pre><code>    ... there is also the fact that for every two real\n    numbers, there is an infinity of rational numbers\n    in between!\n</code></pre>\nSo?  What do you think is the problem with that?  Why does this cause you difficulty?  In particular, it's only a small infinity.  Between any two rationals there is a bigger infinity of irrationals.<p>Your problem seems to be that you are trying to visulaise this in terms of finite collections and finding inconsistencies/contradictions.  It's like being confused that the set of even numbers is the same size as the set of integers, when it should be ""half the size.""  It's pretty much the same type of confusion, but at the next level up.<p><pre><code>    So that makes me (personally, not mathematically)\n    not like the ""almost all"" intuition, instead of an\n    intuition of there always being at least one more,\n    in a particularly slippery way.\n</code></pre>\nThis doesn't make any sense to me - it communicates no knowledge or understanding of your position.  You will need to expand it substantially before I can try to help you adjust your intuition to be more in tune with mainstream mathematics.",1276292124

If there's nothing more onerous than a port-forward it might be useful.<p>But either way I doubt the guys at Dropbox have anything to worry about. To hurt them this doesn't have to appeal to the average Dropbox customer. It only has to appeal to the average paying Dropbox customer. There's a big difference there, but probably not big enough to matter.",1276290648

I'm doing sales for a medical product I built, and the time it takes for a doctor to get back to me just kills me. A lot of follow-up and waiting is required before I finally get the sale.  I often wonder, is there a better way to do this?<p>So HN, what methods work best for you when following up with a slow-moving organization or person? When waiting for a person to do something, do you just fire an email and forget about it? Or do you find it worth following up from time to time with reminders? How do you do that without getting annoying?<p>Has anyone experimented with hiring a virtual assistant to do the follow-up work for you? Are there other tools or hacks out there to make the follow-up process easier and find out why a person's taking so long to get back to you?<p>Your tips are appreciated! (And don't make me follow-up on that! ;-)).",1276290615

I know you're depending on word-of-mouth, but it would still be visible enough (and less stupid) at 80-90% of its current size.<p>One thing that I'd <i>love</i> to see, though, is anything with the depth of text-based MUDs (i.e., where you have different puzzles or quests to discover). I do realize that you're aiming at more casual interactions, but maybe there would be a spot for games where you have basic, casual-styles encounters most of the time but can also launch on an hour+-long quest that will make you discover some more of the world. (And I realize, too, that having a big world means that you need more graphics and stuff - but that's something that you, and not I, would figure out. If you think at Farmville scale, the expenses for the graphics of MapleStory and the likes seem relatively minor).",1276290501

1424741,comment,1424117,1424117,0,0,nopinsight,,,"After playing with it a little I am reminded of a lesson that holds true for many Web apps as well. Assume the user has zero patience to learn about your app. They have a zillion other tabs opening and the moment they get a little frustrated they will simply close your app and move on to another thing to do/play with. So focusing on first-time users is a very important investment, just because every user has to be first-time once, by definition.<p>In this particular game, I think the UI & communication with the user can be improved quite a bit. In Mafia Wars and almost all of the top-hit games, first-time players can easily find out how to do important things in the game, like fighting a given enemy. Here, when I click on the enemy, I see a button which says 'continue', which does not say much. It seems like sometimes 'continue' does nothing, sometimes it starts a fight.<p>Try looking closely at the new tutorial for Mafia Wars (or other top games), it hand-holds the user through all the key steps to understand the basic game mechanics. Also, all their wordings are chosen carefully and have clear meanings to any newbie.<p>Another key idea: give the new player the sense of victory and other positive reinforcements as often as possible. People play game to enjoy the experience: if you fail to defeat your opponent too many times at first, you wouldn't bother to come back. It might also be useful to clearly lead the user to how he can increase the chance of defeating him next time.",1276290151

It's so easy to think that such a thing sounds idyllic when you're clothed, bathed, have a secure food/water supply, all your teeth, are not currently dying of any diseases, and are not subject to the whims of some village strongman who will kill you if you step out of line.<p>Personally I believe that a portion of the Australian outback (and any other country with room for it) should be set aside for people who want to live hunter-gatherer lifestyles. The primary purpose would be to stop the Australian Aborigines from complaining about the whole European-settlement thing (as in <i>""fine, you want to go back to the way things were before? Here ya go!""</i>) but it would be open to anyone of any race who felt like living there. Only two conditions:<p>a) Nothing goes in except the people who want to live there, who can take nothing except a loincloth and one day's food supply.<p>b) Nobody comes out <i>except</i> by giving two months' notice (this stops people from being able to leave to get medical treatment).<p>We could start with a few thousand acres and let it grow if it actually becomes popular.",1276290096
