NT ACLs have actually been more sophisticated than standard Unix permissions for at least ten years.<p>The problem on Windows is the defaults and the behavior of third-party developers. Windows developers worked for a long time with the expectation that the system was single-user (Win9x) or that the user had administrator privileges, making doing anything else annoying at best. XP defaulted to making everybody an administrator, at least in the home edition. That has changed with Vista and Win7.<p>[0] I think some versions targeted at home users do not expose the full ACL functionality.",1276225190

My name is not a secret, but I barely know who you are.<p>You're still using the passive voice. It's not as if ""product managers"" are some well-defined group of people. For that matter, neither are ""bona-fide security researchers"".<p>When I used the word ""researcher"" in scare quotes before, I wasn't trying to say this guy is quack. He obviously isn't. But using the word researcher is overblowing things. In reality, these guys are inspectors. They find real problems, and that is important, but very few of the problems they find are novel in nature. We do continually get the same types of defects reported, so something is wrong, but it has nothing to with reporting strategies. Change the way we write software--that would be actual research.<p>The disclosure trade-offs you describe sound plausible, but don't account for the fact that an inspector may find an issue no one else has discovered.

Every metasearch site out there uses essentially the same interface:  given an origin, destination, departure date, and arrival date, return a list of itineraries in order of increasing price.<p>Needless to say, the number of combinations of these variables precludes doing any kind of exhaustive search (especially since you're being charged per query).  And availability is constantly changing, so your results are potentially out-of-date the instant you receive them.<p>Given these restrictions, the only way to support such broad-ranging queries as ""where can I go for less than $1000?"" is to cache results from previous searches and attempt to guess at the answer.  Which is why, when you start narrowing down date ranges and choosing more obscure airports, the results quickly become so sparse as to be useless.",1276224895

1422596,comment,1422453,1422552,0,0,tansey,,,"Yeah, that's complete bullshit.<p>The ""smart guys"" have been working on Wall St. for decades. Maybe there weren't as many high-profile funds, but they were there. They were there (and blamed) when LTCM collapsed, they were there (and blamed) when the dot-com bubble came, and it should be no surprise that they are still here and being blamed for the current crisis.<p>The notion that smart people are to blame for the financial crisis is like saying tobacco farmers are to blame for lung cancer. The quants aren't the ones making the laws in congress that have torn down regulation for the last 30 years. They aren't the guys demanding huge increases in leverage (even in the case of LTCM, where a few of the high-profile quants did get excessive, it still wasn't their call). They aren't the guys who lowered interest rates or started the housing bubble. They're the guys who just see an opportunity to make money and they take it. If a guy cuts off your leg, throws you in the ocean, and you get eaten by sharks, are you really going to say that your death was the result of a vicious, man-eating shark?<p>The people to blame are the usual bunch. It's congress, the white house, and the executives-- most of whom are not the ""smart guys"" that are being blamed.<p>Quants are a scape goat for a bunch of people unwilling to accept that what happened is not easily traced back to a recent event, but rather requires a longer look back and a more nuanced answer. It's a lazy answer to effectively say, ""Wall St. gave $70 trillion to a bunch of mathematicians who were just too darn smart for their own good, dontchaknow."" Washington got hooked on Reagan-era deregulation, where each time they let the banks go a little further, they got a little more campaign funding, and around and around we go.<p>There are tons of bubbles and crashes in the history of stock markets. Each time people think things are different, and they're always wrong. This is no different than every other time: greed and corruption.<p>(Disclaimer: I work for a hedge fund.)",1276224580

They're vehicles couldn't cope with the cold, so in the winter months, they were bombarded by Soviet bombers but couldn't get any of their own planes in the air.  They couldn't move vehicles because the ground turns to mud (they ended up using dead bodies to gain traction).  At one point, the Germans were very close to Moscow (within visual distance IIRC) when winter hit.  That winter, fresh troops from Siberia who were specially trained for winter warfare arrived in Moscow to push the Germans back.

How many perfectly fine relationships would have been written off by either side if they had a profile to read about the other person beforehand?<p>Which isn't to say that filtering is bad, but rather that the ""scan profile, decide if you want to contact"" idea is by its nature encouraging users to set bars that are too high for their own good.<p>If their match algorithm was good enough, I'd be interested in seeing a dating site where you don't get to view the other person's profile.
