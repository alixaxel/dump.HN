Unskilled players are much more likely to bluff, call bluffs with weak hands, and over or underestimate their hands. In a low stakes, beginners game, there's enough variability that one player with a little more skill won't have much of an advantage. In a professional tournament, the best players show up in the top spots time and again.",1275879593

Most of our developers are one location with a 1/6 minority in another.  The larger group of developers loses the advantages of face-to-face communication for meetings in favor of equal footing for everyone. Is that a net improvement on quality of communication?

That said, I know a great many more people who have sold web businesses and never have to work again than those who are reaping millions in profits via the same. Honestly, I'm amazed at how many people I meet who are financially set based on some obscure web business they sold to a non-traditional acquirer. I'm not even that plugged into the startup community and I've met a couple dozen folks easily. Heck, among YC alums alone I bet you would find a bunch, even the under publicized ones.<p>Are the odds long? sure. Are you more likely to become wealthy spending a few post college years doing a funded startup rather than working at Google? Hell yes.<p>I really liked Rework, and like the ""Profitable and Proud"" series, but there are opportunities for people to fill small product niches and ""sell out"" quickly.
