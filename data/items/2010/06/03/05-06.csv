I was one of four or five high school students chosen to represent the USA at the IOI (international high-school programming competition, akin to the math olympiad).<p>In college, I did the ACM collegiate programming competitions, and we placed eighth in the world.<p>These competitions are useful to me now when I look for jobs, because I have a Ph.D., and people assume that Ph.D.'s can't code. (This is actually, sadly, true more often than you would expect.) So I can point to my programming contest experience to demonstrate my ability to quickly determine the correct algorithm and deliver correct, bug-free code under pressure.<p>Additionally, in the ACM competitions, you get one terminal for three team members. The general strategy is that you code on paper when you don't have the terminal. At USACO training camp, we were did exercises coding on paper.<p>In general, an undisciplined coding instinct is to bust out code quickly, favoring typing over thinking. This can lead to a lot of pain when you need to change things, or need to debug. Coding on paper encourages good design, by privileging thinking over typing.<p>Coding on paper is very useful. I won't dwell on the job thing, but since a lot of job interviews involve coding on paper or on the whiteboard, it's a useful skill. The more important thing is that coding on paper enforces a certain programming disciplines, and teaches you to design things correctly the first time. By ""correctly"", I don't mean ""comprehensively"", but rather in such a way that if you do need to modify your code at a later date, or change your design in some way, that it doesn't involve a lot of pain.",1275542888

Let's try to use it for something constructive.<p>I was reading about the current Oil Spill crisis, and noticed that Google's special discussion page was shut down even though the problem isn't solved! (http://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=68c8&t=68c8.41) In fact, recent news states that all plans so far have failed, and we're reverting to an older solution (that didn't work). Any developer knows what that means -- we're <i>really</i> in the gutter now.<p>Call me naive and hopeful, but I think YCombinator forum's superior simple interface w/ the creative minds here can help solve this crisis.

Don't underestimate the health impact of the lifestyle stuff I suggested.<p>- The projects/surprises angle is my version of mild psychotherapy, and if combined with some vigorous physical exercise and good nutrition will put his emotional system in tip top shape.   At best, this will help his body heal itself, at worst having the conditions he describes would be very depressing and it would help with that.  Planning nice things for others is a surefire way to cheer one's self up.<p>Generally when you go to a doctor and are otherwise young and healthy and you present with bizarre symptoms they take it VERY seriously.  So unless there has been some very poor medical decision making going on he's probably failed all the diagnostic tests for the most severe possible culprits known to his doctors.<p>And, if I had three months to live I could think of worse ways to spend it then with a few good books enjoying surf and sun, and rewarding my physical body with the sort of pampering few of us ever take the time to undertake.  Also, it's generally not all that hot right near the ocean.<p>Finally, I thing it's important to realize that medical science is just not very good and most medical treatments are scarcely better than placebos.  Also, medicine is often very narrowly focused and very rarely advocates nutrition or exercise because typically the 70 year old with a heart problem isn't considered able to make significant lifestyle changes.",1275542010
