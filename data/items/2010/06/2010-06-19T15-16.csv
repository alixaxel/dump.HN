Works for me.</i><p>I am also a programmer and it also works for me.<p>But grandparent was addressed to OP, who has already self-identified as a PHB, a totally different audience.<p>When another programmer talks about ""implementing some things"", I know exactly what he's talking about.  He's going to dig down at his terminal and make things happen.<p>But when a PHB says the same words, it has totally different meaning.  Why?  Because these are ""fluffy"" words which infer different things from different sources.  A PHB ""implementing some things"" probably means project plans and meetings, not coding in the trenches.<p>I think that the most important thing for OP to do is to stop thinking like a PHB and start thinking like a programmer.  In his case, this means focusing on specific details and digging more than 1 level below the surface, 2 things at which PHBs are notoriously weak.  If he continues to think ""some"" and ""implement"", he'll never shed his PHB skin and grow the new programmer persona he'll need.  That's all.",1276962573

I never understood why developers accept 10% for building the whole thing, when they could work on their own ideas. I understand the need for someone who can sell, but it has been by experience that if you have a working product you can find someone to sell it, you only need someone who can sell, when you have something to sell.<p>Now in saying that there is value in finding a co-founder that has domain knowledge of the market you are targeting and if they can sell great, I personally would not go into a ""I develop the whole thing"" arrangement without at least 30% and 50% if there are only two of us. Anything less than that and they have to start ponying up a salary, it is just not enough equity to take the risk, when I can go build something myself with that time spent.<p>As well it sounds like you are dealing with people that feel that there is value in ideas. It has been my experience that those individuals (and their lack of experience, in start-ups) can feel like they did all the work they need to in coming up with the idea.

It's OK if you have incidences like this in the past, as long as there are mitigating factors such as passage of time and circumstances in which the incident occurred.  The investigators just want to make sure you cannot be blackmailed in exchange for secret information.<p>For example, say John has a drug addiction, but he failed to disclose this on his application.  He is eventually granted the clearance, but now he has to keep this secret for the rest of his life.  Someone could easily blackmail him for secret government information.

Like the author, I also agree that this is the real deal and will only continue to get better as technology improves and end users get fatter pipes. I, for one, am looking forward to giving this a go.<p>I might even venture to say that at some point in the future as the platform matures, OnLive will be the preferred distribution platform simply due to the fact that there is no way to resell a game by the end user. Resale is a major problem for publishers who are desperately trying to eek out every last cent from their investments.",1276960617

Not sure why that didn't contribute anything, but that's what most rational adults do in that situation. It certainly wasn't part of the thread until then.<p>In my experience, a two word response containing an obvious course of action that everybody is overlooking like that would have either been downvoted to -4+ or upvoted to 30. It's a crap shoot.<p>Not sure how suing somebody who owes you that kind of money requires a long exposition to explain. The subsequent comment asking for alternatives was upvoted into positive territory that same day it was posted, without adding anything else and with no responses in the form of alternatives.<p><i>edit</i><p>similar, newer comments <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1432131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1432131</a> <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1432131"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1432131</a> <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1432612"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1432612</a> <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1432133"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1432133</a> were not similarly downvoted (and a couple were actually upvoted) yet add no more to the discussion than mine (since they came after my comment and recommend the same thing, by definition, they do not add anything ""new"") and probably should have just been responses to my original comment in the form of adding specificity or methods.<p>It's not the downvotes per se that I mind. People can feel free to disagree that a lawsuit is a bad course of action when somebody owes you $126,000. I think they are wrong, but whatever. It's not like any of the 10 people who hit the little down arrow could be bothered to type ""I disagree with this because..."". But that people continued to downvote long after my suggestion hit -4 shows that allowing downvotes after hitting -4 doesn't work. At that point, I'm just being targeted. Particularly when essentially the same comments were untouched or upvoted. If the thread hadn't moved off the front page rather quickly I'm sure I would have taken more hits.<p>Okay HN community! I got it! I should have provided half a dozen words telling them to sue instead of 3! Clearly that's the community standard as the linked comments demonstrate.<p>I now realize I'm now edw519 or patio11, where every 3 word comment gets half a dozen upvotes.
