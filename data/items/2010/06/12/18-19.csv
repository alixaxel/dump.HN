This calls for a data structure that can efficiently deliver the smallest keyed object from the total set.""</i><p>with this statement, where he defends his claims that the Stoopid Computer Scientists have it all wrong:<p><i>""Did you just decide that my order of magnitude claim was bogus, because it is based on only an extreme corner case? If so, you are doing it wrong, because this is pretty much the real-world behavior seen....Creating and expiring objects in Varnish are relatively infrequent actions. Once created, objects are often cached for weeks if not months, and therefore the binary heap may not be updated even once per minute; on some sites not even once per hour.""</i><p>So, maybe I'm reading this wrong, but it sure sounds like he's going out of his way to find a scenario that results in an ""order of magnitude"" difference, simply so that he can write an article with a big claim.  The only justification for this is left as an exercise in critical thinking for the reader:<p><i>""At this point, is it wrong to think, 'If it runs only once per minute, who cares, even if it takes a full second?'  We do, in fact, care because the 10 extra pages needed once per minute loiter in RAM for a while, doing nothing for their keep—until the kernel pages them back out again, at which point they get to pile on top of the already frantic disk activity, typically seen on a system under this heavy VM pressure.""</i><p>(that sound you hear is the frantic waving of hands)<p>Basically, the claim is that if you build a binary heap for an exceptionally infrequent operation, and make that heap big enough to require multiple pages (about 8 MB, in this case, on a machine that is presumably managing a <i>multi-gigabyte</i> resident web cache), then <i>do absolutely nothing</i> to ensure that it stays in memory, then <i>pick the worst possible runtime scenario</i> (touching every item in the heap in a pattern that results in repeated page faults) you can get pathological behavior.<p>I think I speak for dopey CS professors everywhere, when I say:  Duh.<p>Don't misunderstand my point:  it's not that the article is <i>wrong</i>...it's just that it's so arrogantly written that it's hard to forgive the fact that the situation described is contrived.

The reason for the secrecy was to keep them out so they don't complain.<p>The problem, of course, is that it's too generic and overarching and nobody wins except Big Copyright. When a country is worried about a treaty affecting generic drug manufacturing, IP laws have gone too far.",1276366323

At the time I was not exactly a naive babe in the woods about SEO, and I knew that would be helpful, but I had <i>no clue</i> the extent of how helpful.

For many / most applications, memory is so cheap that you CAN effectively ignore VM. Where some thought about the relative latency of memory is useful though is in parallel applications on NUMA hardware.",1276366228
