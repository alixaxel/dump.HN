SEO is in fact directed towards more effective communication with search engines. Using web analytics, and intelligence we optimize content to be more direct towards users, and search engines by using keywords etc that users are searching for. We're basically improving communications just like quality CRM does only with search engines, and users. Link farms are highly transparent and easily flagged by Google. They have extremely sophisticated algorithms to determine who the spammers are.",1275602388

People who finish big and hard projects are obviously valuable to the entire company and Unicorn rewards this.

Was it somebody new and insane and serious? Was it really about Kathy Sierra, or was it just bad luck to be chosen as the object of attention, a la 4chan?<p>The threats spread outside of the site, got more specific/direct/ violent, and Kathy Sierra cancelled a major appearance (the reason I know this story kinda of well is only because I was attending that event, etech, and it was very special occasion/big deal for me, and I paid extra to attend a tutorial by her :D)<p>People who never specifically admitted to being involved in the initial trash-talking, jumped in to pish-posh the fear/concern over the events, and defend free speech.<p>As far as I know, they never figured out who sent out the death threats, but did figure out some of the horrible trollers. Possible, but unproven that they were the same folks. Possible, and hopefully not true, that the initial stuff was garden-variety trolling, and later stuff was a seriously dangerous crazy person.<p>Some people have dismissed the incident as overblown, blending the off-site death threats, with the initial forum trolling.<p>I personally think they're two separate conversations. I think the initial trolling was horrible and depressing, but somewhat normal. But that the later threats were too disturbing and rare of an occurrence to be dismissed.<p>sidebar:
Though the death threats did lead to a talk cancellation, and curtailing of her blog, it did not make her retire.
She's given many talks since (duh, the top of this thread is about a recent great one).
And her recent departure from Twitter is not the result of anything gnarly happening.<p>sidebar ps:
Almost any post about a Kathy Sierra talk/essay/quote ends up being about missing her/ the unfortunate death threat incident.
This is totally understandable.
That said, I hope nobody misses the opportunities to learn from and benefit her transformational philosophies.
Elsewhere in this thread I discuss the actual video, and how her ideas are as important as Lean, in terms of how they should influence what we do.",1275601474

doesn't work.<p>For the record, regarding 0 in pointer context the C standard has this to say:<p><pre><code>       An integral constant expression with the value 0, or such an
    expression cast to type void * , is called a null pointer constant.  If
    a null pointer constant is assigned to or compared for equality to a
    pointer, the constant is converted to a pointer of that type.  Such a
    pointer, called a null pointer, is guaranteed to compare unequal to a
    pointer to any object or function.

Those were definitely diagnosed and treated as they came, but I had an underlying cough that would not go away. Everyone blamed the cough on lingering effects of the bronchitis and blamed the runny nose on the sinus infections and general breathing problems on the fact that I had just had (insert infection here)...so everyone treated that and just gave me way too much narcotic cough syrup so I can sleep at night.<p>What it really was was that I had all of those, but they weren't as severe or as lingering as everyone thought it was as the runny nose was primarily from allergies and cough from asthma that I thought I had ""grown out"" of years ago. Mind you, some of the drugs to treat the symptoms were still the same, but everyone was so focused on the obvious and on the past (that I had had asthma and it was successfully treated with primarily Advair) that nobody thought to realize that maybe, just maybe, it was back and triggered by something and that all these issues were also overblown as a result, and the same drugs wouldn't necessarily work this time around. Someone at some point suspected the right thing, but Advair used to work for me, and it didn't work this time around, and more than one had put me on prednisone at some point or another and that should have done <i>something</i> but it didn't make a big difference either, so that came and went off the list a couple times. On the flip side, they weren't so cavalier about antibiotics, as I kept on getting switched to new ones as the old one would either stop working or wasn't effective after a few days.<p>So with a fresh slate and with not making assumptions based on even as-recent-as-a-week-ago past, my House thought the infections were related (had enough antibiotics and more to mask the symptoms, but probably not gone altogether) and that my asthma was probably back and bothering me at the same time since if he ignored all the symptoms clearly and only associated with my infections, it was exactly asthma, rather than shoehorning that into ""oh it's because of the bronchitis"" cause that's what happens to ""most people"". In the end, one month of Levaquin seemed to work to obliterate my then-sinus infection, and the rest of it disappeared into thin air when I started a combination of Symbicort, predisone, Xyzal and Astepro. Unfortunately I doubt that would work well for you as half that are steroids :S<p>Soooo...I know when I had the sinus infections from hell, my neti pot was my best friend (every hour, if I could get away with it...), but I don't have any suggestions beyond that :( My story is more of a ""people made assumptions and they were wrong about something so obvious"" than a rare/hard to diagnose one.",1275600367

Why even make a piece of art? What's the point?<p>While it is interesting to view the creation of art through the lens of an engineer, any attempt to criticize the work through only this lens is not going to stand up very well.",1275599378
