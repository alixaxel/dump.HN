And because you don't know the particular tricks I learned, it indicates some sort of deficiency in your knowledge or character.  Hmm...  Nah.<p>> You admit learning about PHP made you a better C++

I would rather be out cycling, rock climbing, or being with friends.<p>> a novice asked<p>You're effectively talking about a student.  Students get a sampling of a lot of ideas.  Experienced software engineers are expected to have mastery in one or more areas.<p>> And that's why it's important for Dick to learn to develop for Linux.<p>That's an absurd conclusion.  Perhaps, ""that's why learning Linux <i>may</i> be important for Dick.""  There are a lot of things in the world to learn.  Perhaps Dick will benefit vastly more from learning some other platform, API, language, or entirely unrelated skill.<p>My point is that this guy comes off as superior and snarky because the MS plebes are discovering what he's known for rh so long.

And the danger of it being a virus (diminishing, but applicable). And etc etc etc.<p>Downloading is asynchronous. It may cost some computer resources, but probably not any which you would not have used anyways.<p>You're missing the point. It's practically free, certainly much freer than the retail price. And usually finding the illegal version something (that's worth it) is just a matter of time.<p>People illegally downloading don't care about <i>authenticity</i> because it's practically free and is worth it to them. Obviously if the time it takes to acquire it illegally over legally is more than its worth to the person, he/she wouldn't do it (or shouldn't do it), but for the majority of people it isn't true.",1277323101
