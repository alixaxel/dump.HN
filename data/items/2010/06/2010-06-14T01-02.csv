When other parents say that they ""have no time"" yet seem unable to answer questions about what they were actually doing, they're not lying or covering up. Time ""disappears"" like crazy yet also feels like an eternity. Days pass by full of chores, cleaning, and calming a screaming baby.. but like with any form of exercise, the painful aspects are somehow forgotten over time.<p>I certainly share the sentiment that having the demand of a child in your life can help you ""focus."" If you know that baby monitor might be going off in 1, 2, 3 or 4 hours (and you have NO clue when!) you start working in a way that's quite organized or that is easy to dip in/out of. This works out for the better. With no such demands, it is very easy to rationalize procrastination.<p>It helps a lot to have everything solid with your partner. I'm NOT a natural parent at all and while I love her, my daughter still bugs the crap out of me and I find it hard to ""deal"" with her for more than an hour or two at a time. I recognize this as a flaw in my personality, but also know I'll be crazy over teaching her things and talking to her when she gets older. This isn't a ""man thing"" as such, but it certainly seems common (my dad was exactly the same way.)<p>As such, my wife is far and away the primary parent. As a nightowl, I tend to my daughter through the night when she wants feeding, etc, but during the day it's 90% mom. I do a lot of chores though, but the arrangement is that I'm the breadwinner and she's a full-time mom.
