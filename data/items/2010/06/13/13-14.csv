1427442,comment,1426830,1426830,0,0,edw519,,,"I love posts like this!  Great answers, pg.  Here are mine:<p><i>1. What are some qualifications of a computer programmer?</i><p>The two most important qualifications are a love of details and a simultaneous appreciation of the bigger picture.  You have to understand the landscape that your software will fit into.  Then you have to be willing and able to dig down deep and be comfortable building stuff at the lowest level of detail.  This takes a great deal of logical thinking, attention to detail, and personal focus.<p><i>2. What is the best part of being a computer programmer? The worst? The most challenging?</i><p>The best part is getting something working for the first time where nothing was there before.  For me, this is so exciting that I still I do a ""happy dance"" every time.  The worst part is the long hours alone.  There's really no way around it; good software takes time and almost everything is done by someone alone at a terminal.  The most challenging is finding a project big enough to not be boring but small enough that's it's too difficult to make good progress.<p><i>3. What’s the salary range in this career?</i><p>As an employee, $35,000 to $200,000.  As a company owner, $0 to billions.  Either way, the range is very wide and depends on many factors, some outside of your control.  Like any other profession, you should be a programmer because you love to program, not because of how much money you'll make.<p><i>4. What is a typical day in the life of a computer programmer?</i><p>I bet there are as many typical days as there are programmers, so I just share mine.  My day starts at my terminal, making changes to my current program based the mark-ups I did to my hard copy in bed the night before.  I spend most of the day at the terminal writing code, changing it, trying it out, and taking occasional notes.  I avoid interruptions as much as I can.  I have a regular lunch and dinner and some social life, but not too much.  Every day ends the same, in bed with whatever I worked on that day, reviewing and marking up.  Incredible attention to detail is required and this is how I do it.<p><i>5. What is some advice you would give to young computer programmers?</i><p>Just build something.  Nothing can be more important.  Whenever you need to learn something, find a way to learn it, whether it's a class, friends, or more likely, a book or website.  It you want to be a programmer badly enough, you'll find this approach natural.  If you don't, you won't.<p><i>6. Is it easy to find a job as a computer programmer?</i><p>If you're good (and can prove it), yes.  It not, not so much.<p><i>7. What was your most exciting project?</i><p>A computer program that wrote other computer programs.<p><i>8. What skills do you think young programmers need for the job?</i><p>The ability to think clearly and logically, good written and verbal communication skills, the discipline to keep working when they'd rather be with other people, and the determination to see something through to completion.<p><i>9. What improvement does computer programming give for human life?</i><p>Computer programming makes software that frees people up to think about and do things that weren't possible just a few years ago.  The possibilites for those people are endless.<p><i>10. What is the future direction of computer programming?</i><p>This is always hard to predict, but I'd guess the direction will head away from writing all of your own software toward connecting a lot of already written software to accomplish the same thing.<p><i>11. Would life be a lot worse without computer programming? How much? Why?</i><p>Just compare life in a country with advanced technology to one without.  Computer programming doesn't have everything to do with the difference, but it does have a lot to do with it.  Much of today's advanced lifestyle has resulted from modern technology.  Much modern technology came from software.  All software came from computer programming.<p>[EDIT: Changed ""Most software"" to ""All software"" in #11.  Thanks sundarurfriend.  Duh.]",1276437311

It's unbelievably helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off of.<p>Secondly, don't rule out working for someone else before you start your own company.  It's very helpful to figure out what your strengths and weaknesses really are on someone else's dime.  Of course, there are plenty of reasons <i>not</i> to work for a big company, but this is one reason <i>to</i> work for a big company.  In a big company, you're forced to work with a variety of different people you might not work with on your own.  This gives you an idea of what types of people you work well with, what kinds of people you don't, and will also make you appreciate working for a smaller company (at least it will if you're cut out for a smaller company).",1276437003
1427436,comment,1427137,1427273,0,0,elblanco,,,"Most every South Korean wants reunification at some point. But the truth of it is that the current generation doesn't really think about North Korea much. Those that do cite the the German experiment as an example of a very cautionary tale about reunification.<p>This of course despite the fact that many older generation Koreans would feel compelled to have some kind of punishment for the ""communists"" (in quotes because the word is abused in South Korea by the older generation to the point of being meaningless) and their various crimes against the South. Of course this would further complicate reunification.<p>I think beyond just hearing what South Koreans say, look at what they do. The Kaesong Industrial Area is cited in the South as a way to try and drag at least some portion of the North's populace into the 21st century. Because if reunification of any type did happen, the consensus is that they are virtually without any useful skill to the South. Ultimately, reunification means that the Northerners will <i>have</i> to become productive, job holding, members of society. All of the BS they spend time drilling on in school, like the great works of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jung Il and learning how to perform in mass games and create propaganda ballets about dam construction, are absolutely meaningless in a modern industrialized world. If the two Koreas reunified tomorrow, they would have to figure out what to do with 20 million unskilled laborers.<p>The bright side is that the pragmatists see this as a way of perpetuating the cheap labor pool requirements for an export driven economy. South Korea has started bringing in labor from places like Indonesia, Nepal, Vietnam, etc. because they can use these laborers on low waged manufacturing jobs. If 20 million North Koreans suddenly became available, it would greatly simplify things (in theory) for the manufacturing chaebols in the South. They'd simply bus in Northerners at $10-20/day to build TVs and Ships and Construction equipment and all the other odds and ends that South Korea needs to produce to stay wealthy. Kaesong is supposed to be laying the ground work for that eventual day.<p>I think likely, if the regime collapsed in the North, they'd move to keep the two countries in place, but with very close economic ties, (perhaps like the U.S. and Canada, with a lax border) for at least a couple generations and use the North as a cheap labor pool and industrial center very similar to how many countries use China. Once the standard of living increased in the North to the point that the South could reasonably absorb the North, and/or the Northerners were demanding wages too high to keep the export model afloat, they'd probably reunify.",1276436987

The tablet isn't the hurdle, it's the lame network infrastructure and ridiculously slow internet connections. Most the imaging companies have viewers that are nothing more than glorified jpeg viewers. The pain points are accessing the data and how it's stored. Doctors often have extra image studies performed simply because getting the images from previous studies performed at another imaging center is such a hassle.",1276434246

The math just doesn't work.  If an individual contributor is going to get 1%, what do the founders have?  What do the investors have?
