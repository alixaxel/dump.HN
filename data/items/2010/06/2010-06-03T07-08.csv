The difference though is that you probably wouldn't enter into a home loan situation unless you already had a job -- going to university is supposed to be the groundwork to get you a job. There's a much higher uncertainty there, so much bigger risk. But I mean I always think it's a good idea to have a backup plan -- I did a major in computer science too, and worked in industry as a programmer, and though I'm pretty poor (out of practice) at it and don't particularly enjoy it, I can always do it if I ""get stuck"". :)",1275551781

This is true of most things you buy. How much can you buy a steak for? How much can you sell it for after it's cooked just right? But the price is determined mostly by the cost of production and its intersection with the market's willingness to pay.<p>The real solution is to remove all special protection from college loans. Bankruptcy should cancel them like any other loan, and they should not be especially easy to get, especially not for poor people (who, despite all hopes for an equal world, will probably be making less on average after school and thus be in a worse position to pay back).

Recently I have lost a close family member because the doctor who first visited him overlooked some symptoms that could potentially lead to the discovery of his disease (a cancer). Time passed and the cancer developed to a stage that was impossible to cure.<p>Following this experience, I've started playing with the idea of a world-wide user generated symptoms database, managed and moderated by real doctors and experts. The main issue with such database would be the enormous amount of ""false positive fright"" triggered by casual users just checking out basic symptoms (for instance, a sudden high fever can be a symptom of a cancer initiated infection <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16257792"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16257792</a>, but can also be a symptom of many other less life threatening diseases).
I'm not a doctor so I'm not aware if something similar already exist - probably it does, on a country specific basis maybe? I know for sure that some doctors use Google regularly to double check their diagnoses. In most European countries, the majority of initial diagnoses are done by General Practitioners, who are doctors assigned to a patient by the national healthcare system. These doctors actually redirect patients to specialists or to hospitals for specific analysis based on - often very quick - assessments of the patient's symptoms.<p>I'm not sure how the healthcare system works in other countries, but I believe that there is always some kind of initial medical routing based on symptoms. 
I wonder if the precision of this initial assessment could be improved through this database and some statistical algorithms? Any doctor, biologist (and of course, regular HNers) care to share his/her catch on this idea?",1275550503

Camera callbacks need to be implemented conditionally based on whether autofocus is available and selected.  EXIF orientation data isn't reliably recorded on some devices, and the EXIF interface class isn't available in older SDK versions.

Of course others exist but those are two big ones. Each has its own benefits and disadvantages.<p>- For bug tracking, JIRA has a starter package that is $10 per app for like 10 users. Some people like JIRA/Fisheye/Greenhopper etc, others don't so use your judgment. I think for the price and the functionality you get it's a decent deal. Beware though if you grow past the number of users it's a little bit of sticker shock.<p>- Look into either Agile type strategy. I've used it on several projects and it has served me well.
