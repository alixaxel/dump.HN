1454680,comment,1454509,1454509,0,0,nailer,,,"Anyone know if 0MQ (or similar) can have multiple publishers send to the same queue? Some context:<p>- I currently have an app where users submit content to a single machine, which is then queued (using Python's inbuilt Queue object), and processed and displayed by threads that run on the queue.<p>- In future, I've been thinking about using a network queue to easily publish from a single source to multiple display servers, with a load balancer in between them. This neatly handles my 'view only' users.<p>- But what about if I wanted to allow users to submit from any server, ie, spreading the load for contributing users as well?<p>I'm guess I'm looking for a multiple publisher / multiple subscriber queue. Does anyone know if they exist?",1277294290

This is, he says, akin to how many biological systems work (e.g. individual cells/neurons are pretty simple, but a human is very complex).<p>He also - correctly - observes that the explosion in computational power afforded by modern computers make certain scientific investigations possible that were previously infeasible (e.g. the proof of the four-colour theorem relying on exhaustively testing some 1800 possible scenarios, or numerical simulation of some very complex phenomena).<p>He then combines these two passions of his and asserts that therefore, computation based on simple systems gives insight into the secrets of life, the universe, and everything.",1277293863

1454659,comment,1445519,1452827,0,0,nunb,,,"> Making super-bold claims like ""Metabolic syndrome ... is the ""best"" predcursor/predictor for cardiac mortality"" .. example of over-interpreting.<p>That is an unfair charge, the claim is not based solely on that study. Taubes reviews  50+ years of observations and research on this. Besides, that claim is my hypothesis, which is yet to be tested.<p>I in no way present it as anything other than a theory.<p>> In conclusion, your level of belief of well-established science (such as statin trials; >100,000 people, total)<p>Citation?<p>> is too low, and your willingness to extrapolate from very small studies (50 people, total) is too high.<p>I will grant that this is the case. It's because the large scale studies for the hypothesis I put forward do not exist yet. I would like to see NIH funded diet-intervention studies at the same scale, even n=200 would be a great thing.<p>> each study, instead of in proportion to your desire for the study to be true. It's hard for all of us to do, but it's the hallmark of the scientific approach.<p>Nice burn in the last sentence!<p>While I agree that my hypothesis has not been tested, it has not been negated either.<p>I would like to see well funded and well designed studies to settle the issue conclusively, therefore the charge about the scientific approach is a bit off the mark: I am not holding on to a belief in the face of overwhelming evidence against it, I merely postulate an alternative hypothesis which has the potential to neatly (in the Occam's razor sense) explain several inconsistencies in the current model (and should be tested for merely on that basis, if for no other).<p>The ApoB issue was raised as there were some pubmed papers that discussed the test and what advantages it had over others in predictive power. I cannot find the ref. right now, but it should be easy to search for. In any case, that was a tangential point I made and you spend a lot of time addressing it, while not addressing other tests like homocysteine levels etc.<p>MS is a catch-all term for several coincidentally occuring symptoms, as far as I can tell. IR is one of them, abdominal obesity is another, prevalence of LDL and high triglyceride counts are yet more markers. For all I know, IR is the major symptom, that's why at one point I refer to IR and then say ""aka MS"". Again, this point is tangential.<p>When you said ""Cholesterol"" I naturally assumed ""Total Cholesterol"". I note that you have clarified that. Also, LDL-C I presume includes the VLDL counts? That raises another possible issue: what if the symptoms observed in these studies actually indicate that VLDL is highly correlated with mortality, and that due to some confounding factor, the subjects in these studies have very high VLDL? In that case LDL would be unfairly blamed. Do you agree?<p>> Looking at coronary calcification is no better than looking at lipoprotein fractions; both are intermediate endpoints. I see no reason to trust calcification if you don't trust LDL. Reduction in LDL correlates so well with ... FDA-got-bought-out-by-pharma sort of problem.<p>You did not address the Agatston score point, which iirc was the main rebuttal I'd made to your earlier comment. As this discussion is threatening to run off on another tangent, I will end here.<p>> To reject the overwhelmingly data-backed LDL hypothesis, I'd need to see something much more compelling, I must say.<p>Perhaps GCBC may itself be compelling?<p>I will state that most of my stance is covered in GCBC (to the extent that you could say I got it from there) and it should be quite easy to test the alternative hypotheses laid out in that book. Perhaps we can revisit this thread when the issue is settled to our satisfactions and marvel at the different positions we took.",1277293694

Lucida Sans Typewriter and Bitstream Vera Sans Mono are also somewhat heavy, as are Menlo and Mensch.<p>I find Andale Mono to be the perfect blend of legibility, distinctive character forms, and lightness, for black letters on white background.  With its shorter and rounded letterforms providing a sense of white space between lines, I suspect this font is reminding me of highly legible daisy wheel printouts.  This is my font of choice for both coding and plain-text email.  It's not as widely known, but people who use it become somewhat fanatical.<p>In Terminal I use amber on black, and find Monaco 10pt. better because of the line height and old school terminal feel.
