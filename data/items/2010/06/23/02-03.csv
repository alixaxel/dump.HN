Otherwise, its at best 1/80th of a chance they are running your ads, but probably worse as each app is not created equal. If yours is a ""killer app"" that is use most often, its more than likely not ad-driven unless a guy likes playing iChess on the shitter.<p>All of the data you provided is great - but none of it ties to money paid. 10.2 billion ad requests means dick if there wasn't any money exchanging hands. You said yourself there's no definitive evidence of people making a lot from mobile app advertising, so I'm not sure what point you were defending in the first place.",1277259392

I and other friends have drunk (or better said tasted) wine and beer since we were kids (less than 10 years old) and we haven't become alcoholics. Sure, I know a couple of people who drink a bit too much at parties, but still, I don't think that forbidding them to drink until they were 21 would have avoided this.
