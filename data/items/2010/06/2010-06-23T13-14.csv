Does he keep his fusion reactor surrounded by tons of water all day? The article mentions this reactor is perfectly legal, but i know radiation sources are a very regulated thing. On one hand, his reactor probably only produces afew neutrons a minute, and so probably wouldn't be regulated or be a danger to anybody. On the other hand, im just speculating, how do i know the neutron production of this guys reactor? Has anybody measured it to determine it is safe? Why was the BBC so lazy in researching this article?",1277301588

1454922,comment,1454551,1454781,0,0,lukev,,,"I feel your pain - I struggle with the same thing. But I think it's possible, to some extent, to have the best of both worlds.<p>An ideal of <i>clean</i>, <i>logical</i> design actually satisfies both #1 and #2. You don't write any more than you need to, but you architect it sensibly so if you need to modify it in the future, there's a natural way to do it.<p>A case study: you are responsible for maintaining a moderately sized mailing list.<p>Type 1: Maintains a comma+newline separated list of name/email pairs in a text file, parse it with a 3 line perl script that sends an email for each regex match. Done in 15 minutes. YAGN anything else.<p>Type 2: Builds a fully relational model in a database with seperate tables for names and addresses, backed by Hibernate with a complete class hierarchy including AbstractRecords (in case you want to store records other than name/email pairs), RecordFactories (In case we need to generate lists of records from another source), AbstractRecordDAO (in case we need to use a different Database or ORM framework), EmailFactories, AbstractMailerImpl, etc, etc, etc, planning in the architecture for anything anyone might ever want to do with a mailing list.<p>Both of these are wrong, IMO.<p>The correct solution is to write <i>one</i> database table, or one cleanly formatted file, with a program with perhaps two classes that abstract apart the data loading and the mailing tasks. One class loads the data into a simple Map structure, and the other that handles iterating the map and doing the mailing.<p>It only takes a bit longer to write than #1, and is infinitely simpler than #2. It doesn't anticipate every future need, but when one comes, there's a logical point to start adding the functionality. If I have to do something new with the list, I don't have to completely rewrite my program (like #1 does), I just write a new class that uses the existing data structure. Just as extensible as #2, with a tenth of the work. And easy to see what's going on.",1277301493

For example, moving patterns in most automata can only travel in certain preferred directions (like gliders in Conway's game of life). And patterns that can move in multiple directions usually travel with different speeds in each direction.<p>In the real world, we don't observe any anisotropy in space, so none of the cellular automata I've seen proposed up to this point can model real physics, even in principle.<p>Lattice gas automata use hexagonal grids instead of square grids to alleviate this problem somewhat, but the anisotropy never really goes away, it's just reduced.",1277300868

1454890,comment,1453005,1453005,0,0,mbubb,,,"I think about this all the time. 2 boys 3 and 6 yrs old. I cringed a bit when I saw the title because it made me think of the term 'alterna-dad' and of a style of parenting in which children become accessories and 'buddies' to their extended adolescent parents. Sport matching mohawks, etc, etc.<p>But the article was nothing like that. It is short but the feeling I got was of true exploration and of forging a real relationship. (Another HN post of the past few days talked about how you have +/- 10 yrs to connect with yr kid). It also reminded me (as other posters noted) of that SouthPark where they all play WOW and meet Randy in game. Or the classic 'Chinpokemon'. Two really well done episodes - in both cases parents wade through unfamiliar territory to meet their kids and understand them better. Not simply ban the game.<p>There is danger in letting your chidren do certain things. The impulse to bubblewrap them is strong. I catch my breath everytime they do things like walk with me out on our balcony (17th floor), ride the scooter in the skatepark, climb on the rocks in the park across from our apartment, etc. But I consciously hold myself back - watching them but not rushing in to stop them. This week end my 3 yr old got punched full in the face by a 5 yr old. I held back for a count of 10 to let him deal with it as he wanted to and then comforted him a bit and broght him back so he could feel safe playing around this kid.<p>The point is to show them experientially that you trust them - and that you are in the background to help them if things get scary. I felt that vibe from this writer and applaud that.<p>In truth  I have no idea of what I am doing. I use my intuition as a guide and hope I am right. What he says about the ESRB is spot on. If - as a parent - you need a school, govt agency or rating agency to tell you what is safe for your kid - then you are screwed. You need to go through it with your child and see for yourself.<p>You can get good advice from individuals - teachers, other parents, certain writers - but not from agencies and bureacracies.<p>As a parent dealing with impact of media in general is a challenge. For the past 2 yrs we went off cable tv and started to rely completely on the internet/ public library/ netflix for movies etc. I have held off on getting Wii/ x-box, etc in favor of PC based games. They have both watched tons of anime and comics (particularly stuff like Miyazaki Hayako (sp?) and the Avatar series). They both love Futurama - which might be too adult at times for them. I will have to explain 'death by snoo-snoo' one of these days.<p>My older son has learned to really enjoy some of the games that an Ubuntu distribution has to offer - things like Wormux, OpenSonic, BattleTanks. He has looked over my sholder as I have played some of the Doom emulations on the android or the Quake-like games on Ubuntu.<p>From hacker news I found out about the Wolfire free bundle and he fell in love with the Samorost series. He cried when it was done and drew a big picture of what he thought the next episode should be.<p>More recently on my wife's computer (WinXP) I downloaded Steam and setup the free version of Portal and bought a Tower Defense game to play.<p>Every time we take the subway or wait somewhere my wife and/or I whip out the gPhone and let the two of them play android games.<p>We try to limit this to certain times of the week etc. because of the vague fear that media will completely saturate their lives.<p>It is not the violence alone that gives me pause. I knwo experientially how absorbing a good game is (thinking of days past playing Half-Life or Diablo, etc).<p>I want them both to enjoy good media and I am loosely overlapping anime, movies and games because I feel like there is power in the imagery of soemthing like Half-Life or Miyazaki's ""Princess Mononoke"" which affects you deeply.<p>What often pisses me off are crappy movies in which the point is simply to sell a lifestyle. I hate movies like  ""Shark Tales"" or ""Madagascar"" and I cant say exactly why. There are funny bit parts but the whole thing feels like it is in the service of  what the philosopher Adorno referred to as the ""Culture Industry"". I find those movies more disturbing than somethign with more overt violence.<p>In a very interesting way I think this goes back to Plato and his fear of 'poetry' by which he included dramatic arts. It was the fear of the power of images. We have reached the point where video games and anime have reached a complexity and depth of imagery that they have a life of their own.<p>I know myself that these things affect me differently. I am trying to see through my sons' eyes to see how they are affected. At times it feels dangerous - like letting them speed ahead on their little bikes on the city sidewalk - but what this guy is doing is right. Watch them in the background, ready to bolt after them - let them know that you trust them and that you are there to help deal with the scary parts - let them experience it and learn from them as they reflect their experience back to you.<p>Plato on images:

1454815,comment,1454551,1454687,0,0,jemfinch,,,"> So what's wrong with using a switch statement if all you have are 3 operations?<p>Because you won't always have only three operations.  What about division?  Exponentiation?  Square root?  Factorial?  Arbitrary user-defined functions?  What if you didn't anticipate an operation one of your clients needs?  If you use standard OO principles, your client can rectify that problem; if you use a switch statement, they can't.<p>> Even if more operations had to be added I'd probably let it grow to the point where the method the switch is in was getting a bit unwieldy then look at refactoring it using a pattern if I really thought it would be worth it.<p>Why not just do it right from the start?  It's extremely simple, it's a pattern <i>every</i> OO programmer is familiar with, it's more computationally efficient and has other advantages as well.<p>It's also not nearly as complicated as the linked Strategy code.  The appropriate analogue to the author's switch statement (in Python, since I'm not a Java programmer):<p><pre><code>    class Op(object):
      def eval(self, a, b):
        raise NotImplementedError

    class Add(Op):
      def eval(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    class Subtract(Op):
      def eval(self, a, b):
        return a - b

    class Multiply(Op):
      def eval(self, a, b):
        return a * b
</code></pre>
It's twelve non-blank lines, more than half of them boilerplate; translated into Java it would probably gain a few keywords and a couple lines of ending braces, but would not grow significantly.  Compare this to almost that many lines for the switch version (note that the OP left out the declaration of the enum, the function boilerplate, etc.) for something less maintainable, less extensible, less idiomatic, and with lower performance.",1277298935

XHTML has an advantage here; every data item can be labeled with an id or class attribute to make it easier to find. You can't do that in JSON unless everything is a dictionary value.<p>For methods, browsers support GET and POST, and they can simulate PUT with upload controls. For DELETE, the common approach is to use POST with _method=DELETE as a parameter. That's easy to adjust in your service as the request comes in so most of your service doesn't have to know about it.<p>Browsers are also pretty good about sending other headers, particularly the ones that have to do with caching. That'll force you to deal with them, which is a good thing.<p>Ideally, you'll want to just generate a data structure internally, and use the Accept request header to determine whether to send a text/json or text/html response. That way clients that want JSON can ask for and get it, while generic clients (eg: browsers) will get something they can handle.

Learn a popular web development framework and start building. Today. With or without a job.<p>Then parlay that into your interview process. Do NOT get hung up on ""gee, I have no idea how to scale to ~1 million users."" Almost nobody entering web dev for the first time knows how to do this. Many who've been doing web-related work for <i>years</i> don't know how to do this. Scalability is just one aspect of web dev and for a majority of projects (corporate IT projects with 1 - 100 users) it's a complete non-issue. Nevertheless, they might still say ""experience building scalable web applications"". Do NOT let this stop you from interviewing.<p>You have one huge advantage while seeking a job in web dev as opposed to the desktop world: your work is immediately visible to anybody in the world. Every website you build is a portfolio piece. And if you can discuss these in the interview, and communicate above all your enthusiasm for the work, you'll get the job. Somewhere.<p>Good luck!",1277298694

1454800,comment,1454642,1454642,0,0,jasonlbaptiste,,,"I've wondered this in some ways too, but then I'm curious whether it makes sense in the long run.  Normal people can't understand the risks associated with investing in startups, even if it might be very small amounts of stock purchases.  The risks are significantly higher if they only invest in ~5 companies, which many might do.  From what I've read, angel investing starts to even out when you hit upwards of 20 companies.  You would also have to start dealing with intense regulation.  < sarbox+being a normal public company, but something way more than a traditional reg d filing.  One alternative MIGHT be:  Start a small angel fund where people can get in with a small buy in (500? 1,000?).  Then you'd have 500 investors and I don't know if you can legally do that.  (Saying that in the I have absolutely no f'ing clue sense).",1277298613
