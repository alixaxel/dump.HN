1444503,comment,1444384,1444384,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"First of all, congratulations-- looks like you've got a nice site and product.<p>Second, even more congratulations-- the fact that you are measuring the CR the way you are from the beginning shows some understanding of the process.<p>I think that trying to make judgments based on 500 page views is premature-- right now, it is good to figure out your baseline numbers, so that you can start doing A/B testing to improve the various ratios.  If I were in your shoes, I'd try to spend a couple weeks trying to increase the traffic, and then go to work on the CRO.<p>But: getting one serious user out of every 100 pageviews sounds like an excellent start to me.<p>The lack of paying customers isn't a big surprise, based upon your pricing scheme: there's no incentive for people to  start paying until they reach the limits you've imposed (1000 notes or 500MB), and it's going to take your early users some time to get there.<p>The product looks slick-- personally, I have a bunch of OneNote notebooks in my Dropbox, which gives me the same effect in a satisfactory way, so I'm not motivated to switch to Folderboy-- but it looks like a service I could easily pitch to others.<p>One small thing: when your resources permit, you might want to hire a voice actor to re-do the YouTube video.  I think it would add a ""professional touch"".",1276948538

1444499,comment,1444212,1444465,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> It's cheap to get that salary, too. All you have to give up is your dreams.<p>Don't forget the effect of compound interest: they want your soul as well, and you burn out more every year for as long as you stay.<p>In my early career, a headhunter came after me to interview with his London bank client. I did a few quick sums at that point, and it's not nearly as attractive a package as it looks.<p>I'm in Cambridge, UK, so we have quite a few guys around here who get approached by the big London banks or who choose to interview there; a few of my friends did. Without exception, the ones who took the jobs get up early, commute down on overcrowded trains, work long hours during the day itself, and then commute home on overcrowded trains. By the time they've done that, they are so tired that they often don't want to do much on weekday evenings any more. The only thing that might improve the situation is moving to London, but that pushes your cost of living way up.<p>I don't earn as much money on my decent IT contracts as your £150k+bonus friend, and I've been working a bit longer. On the other hand, by the time you figure out an hourly rate including things like commuting time, I bet I'm not that far off. By the time you factor in the costs of commuting or getting London accommodation, I'm even closer. Oh, and I still have a life Monday-Friday.<p>I can understand people who go straight into that kind of environment for a couple of years after university, when you're young enough to take it and you're basically making an investment of 2-3 years of having no life in exchange for more comfort for the rest of your life. But I can't understand why anyone would want to stay there for much longer, even with all the financial reward: money is only worth anything if you have time to enjoy spending it.",1276948087

1444493,comment,1444480,1444480,0,0,dirtyaura,,,"It's a rather long article, but has good observations by someone who has tried different tablet OSes.<p>I personally believe that we are on the verge of a fundamental shift in computer UIs. And it starts by scaling up from a simpler solution (e.g. iOS UI, Android, Meego), not by scaling down from a more complex solution (traditional desktop UIs).<p>Now the interesting question is that when we need to support a lot of different kinds of actions/tasks in an application, how will this be supported in touch UIs. Russ mentioned Photoshop as a good example of such application.<p>In our upcoming iPhone game, we have played around with circular context menus and at least in that setting they seem to be quite promising. However, you can really only have a few choices (4-5) in circular context menu on iPhone. However, on iPad or tablet, you could have several ""rings"" of actions. Traditionally, in mouse-based systems, circular context menus haven't have several rings because of the Fitts' law, but on the touch based system, I don't see that as a problem.<p>Any thoughts of possible directions, where touch UIs will evolve?",1276947540

1444479,comment,1441701,1442955,0,0,vog,,,"That's exactly what I thought about it, too. The example function is close to spaghetti and needs at least one helper function with a well-chosen name.<p>The previous example (if-then-else with a complicated boolean logic) has a similar problem: Nobody should write such a mess in the first place. Instead, give speaking names to terms like ""a"" and ""!a & (b|c)"". And with ""speaking names"" I don't mean stupid stuff like ""isAandBorC"", but something like ""waterSuppyOutOfLimits"". That way, humans no longer need to think in boolean algebra but in terms of the problem's domain.<p>He is focusing on the <i>structural</i> aspect of programming, making spaghetti code more manageable by easier dynamic investigation of (partial) special cases.<p>However, statements like ""names are just comments"" show that he's completely missing the <i>linguistic</i> aspect of programming. With well-chosen names you don't have to look at the low-level details to understand what's happening. That's what makes abstractions powerful.",1276946072

Apple are a software company, and they make great hardware to drive sales of their software. I love my MBP, but if it was just an expensive windows machine I'd never have seriously considered buying it. I bought it for OS X.<p>Also, I personally think that the switch to Intel was a massive deal, and changed the fate of the Mac.",1276945909
