You can test anything, including entirely different versions of an app.  The idea that you can't test good design is what designers tell themselves to justify their operating on gut feeling and pulling opinions out of their asses.<p>There isn't anything a user does that you can't come up with a way to test, designers are just afraid of actual data showing them they're full of shit.  They don't want their ideas challenged democratically by users, they want their own ideas used instead because of some misplaced sense of taste.

Using the scale every day teaches you to become obsessed with your weight. A lot (not all) make the association of:<p>My weight == My self worth<p>So if they slip up and put on 3 pounds, they feel horrible about themselves. I also think this doesn't promote a healthy long-term method of thinking because at <i>some point</i> you will stop loosing weight. At some point you will have that beach body you wanted -- and then what? If you were obsessed all along with the weight of BF measurements, then you can potentially loose your cause to continue.<p>This happened to me when I lost 30 lbs. I was so obsessed with the weight, I took it off in 2 months, and kept it off for about 6... then gained it all back + 10lbs over the next 2 years due mostly to being ""bored"" once I was ""done"" with the diet and had been at my goal weight for so long.<p>Again, this just happened to work for me.<p>I actually like excercise, but I liked food more. So without giving up the good quality foods I liked (eating fast food for every meal doesn't count) I upped my activity level to compensate and have enjoyed a much healthier method of taking off weight for <i>my</i> personality type.<p>I still have a bit of a gut, but I'm stronger, faster and cardio is much better with better blood work -- and that is what matters to me long-term. These are the type of habits I want to carry forward... needing to work out every day, enjoying what I do.<p>I want to pass good habits to my kids some day, and that all starts with learning to love physical movement I think (unless you are a phenomenal eater, then that's good too... but most of us aren't)<p>If you don't mind playing sports or exercise and LOVE food, then try and play with upping your activity level instead of dialing back your diet.<p>Fight 1 battle at a time.<p>The pride and confidence you will gain from feeling better will naturally translate to not eating so much of the really terrible food (drive thru) and instead replacing it with something slightly worse... maybe a veggie pizza or something.<p>That being said, I'm by no means a guru, I just know for 10 years I've tried everything and this is the only thing that worked for me.<p>Also, if you are the type that likes to push yourself and kick your own ass to see if you can take it -- you need to look into CrossFit, it's awesome.",1277171499
