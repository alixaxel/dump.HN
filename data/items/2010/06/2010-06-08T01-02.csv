They do not simply mean attackers can inject ""random gibberish"".<p>Furthermore, your nonce problem doesn't mean attackers can inject messages; it means attackers can cryptanalyze messages.<p>It would be helpful, before trying to implement cryptographic security for other people, for you to spend some time researching cryptography. A great way to do that is to learn how to attack cryptosystems in other applications. Maybe that should be your next project.<p>Best of luck, Nick.",1275962384

Coincidentally, that was also my last drug test.<p>Now, I don't use illegal drugs;  Hell, I could easily pass one of those 'hair tests' that see if you have used marijuana in the last few years.   Still, as an employee, my assumption is that if you require a drug test or similar, you are not a company that will respect me as an employee.  My assumption if you made me take a 'personality test' would be that your company is run by idiots.<p>The rest seems to be pretty good advice, assuming that you are a company that can't just hire people as a contractor, and then let them go if they don't work out.<p>this is what I do at my company:  If someone looks good, I hire them for a short project.

Some applications, oh, say High Frequency Trading depend on getting the calculation done first.

No. Problems of scale requiring massive hardware or clusters, do they use assembler? Not generally.  Often they use Lisp, C++ or C.<p>So in the context of real-world problems, compilers win, because none of us has the energy or attention span to write it in assembler, something the size of a real-world problem like, for example, a compiler.<p>We optimize small problems by hand, but problems of useful size we don't because the compiler does a better job on problems of true interest than we have the patience or time to do.<p>To put it another way, it is better to put energy into improving compilers than getting into a John Henry type of competition.",1275961608

1412730,comment,1411621,1412624,0,0,nickbw,,,"Actually I really appreciate Weis' comments, because they're actual concrete problems and implementable solutions. (A bit-flipping attack is not particularly interesting by itself, since the server can inject gibberish any time it wants anyway, unless it can be used to insert <i>meaningful</i> content. But I will be happy to add both a MAC and a better nonce.)<p>What I don't understand is why you think any unaudited code is secure. There is no mechanism by which code from an unknown source becomes trustworthy without someone reading it, or <i>being able</i> to read it.<p>Nowhere am I suggesting that understanding the javascript source is quick or easy, but it is in fact <i>possible</i>, which is the difference between encrypting client-to-server vs. client-to-client. Source code you can view is not automatically trustworthy. Of course not. But it is <i>easier</i> to trust than code you will never be allowed to see. Can we at least agree on that much?<p>As far as trustworthiness, I would say: local code > remote code run on the client > remote code run on the server > closed source. This makes (a theoretically fatal-bug-free) bonchat-like system worse than PGP, but better than Facebook IM.<p>It sounds like your real complaint is with the ""marketing"", such as it is. Perhaps I should do a better job labeling it as experimental, or a proof of concept? These would be actual concrete criticisms.<p>Folks complaining of XSS vulnerabilities seem to be under the mistaken impression that it somehow secures you against <i>the people you're talking to</i>, which is not the problem it's trying to solve. Unescaped HTML chat is vulnerable to XSS, which is why you shouldn't exchange raw HTML with random strangers. You wouldn't open an HTML attachment from a stranger, but you'd open one from your good web developer friend.<p>(A very fair complaint is that, although XSS is irrelevant to the intended use, I should've anticipated that people would want to test/demo the basic chat features by broadly distributing passwords. This turns it into, essentially, a plain text chat with two URLs you have to enter. Which is useless, but perhaps amusing, so I've added default HTML escaping.)",1275961352

Its not that I don't trust you, being some random guy on the internet, but there are people who study history and government structure for a living and I'd think they might have more experience with this sort of thing.</i><p>If you want your truth from authority, join a church.   Universities have the same selection method (existing clergy/academics choose the next generation based on whether the existing clery/academics agree with the views of the rising class), and same history (Harvard, Yale, etc were founded seminaries).<p>I studied political-science at Yale, and the professors are in their own world.  Their studies had little to relation to the real world of politics, which I had learned about from actually working in Congress.  The university in many subjects has devolved into the modern equivalent of  scholasticism.  Peer-review can be a tool for eliminating falsehood.  But it can also be a tool for filtering out truth, and perpetuating falsehood.  This applies 10X for politically sensitive subjects.  Universities receive greats amount funding from nominally democratic governments.<p>That said, even a politically correct institutions can't always avoid the truth.  Check out this NYTimes article, it cites a bunch of professors who have studied the link between democracy and violence: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/opinion/30patterson.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1275311050-4oDgrH8preLcMo3dxEf%20%20g&pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/30/opinion/30patterson.html?a...</a><p>I haven't read any of the works cited in the article, so I can't vouch for them.  I came to my conclusions by studying for myself the history of dozens of democratic transitions.  I suggest doing the same yourself, if you are really interested.  Pick five or ten countries randomly.  Trace their history, starting as far back as you can.  Read both progressive, reactionary, and primary sources.  And then examine whether the democratic transitions they underwent increased or decreased the quality of governance.<p><i>Wow. I don't even know what to do with a historical argument this absurd.</i><p>From Sydney George Fisher's History of the American Revolution: ""When we consider that this mob rule was steadily practised for a period of more than ten years, it is not surprising that it left an almost indelible mark on our people. They seem to have acquired from it that fixed habit now called lynch law, which is still practised among us in many parts of the country in a most regular and systematic manner, and participated in by respectable people. The term lynch law originated in the method of handling the loyalists in the Revolution, and was named from the brother of the man who founded Lynchburgh in Virginia....If the loyalists could come back from the grave, they would probably say that their fears and prophecies had been fulfilled in the most extraordinary manner; sometimes literally; in most cases substantially. There is no question that the Revolution was followed by a great deal of bad government, political corruption, sectional strife, coarseness in manners, hostility to the arts and refinements of life, assassination, lynch law, and other things which horrified Englishmen and afforded the stock material for the ridicule of such writers as Dickens and Mrs. Montagu.""

I should have said, the virulent anti-semitism of the 1930's did not exist in Germany in the era of Metternich (first half of the 19th century).  Anti-semitism was prevalent centuries before.  The situation had gotten much better by the mid-1800's.  But with the introduction of universal suffrage in 1870 it got much worse again.<p><i>But leaders in autocracies do the exact same thing as well. So it seems like how widespread the franchise was might not be the relevant variable.</i><p>It happens most in autocracies that came to a power as a result of party politics, or a violent struggle between political parties.  Elections are the poison, tyranny and civil war are the disease.  It's extremely rare in history to find a demagogue monarch.<p><i>Do you have any model societies where a small fraction of the population votes instead?</i><p>Victorian Britain, America before 1820, Rhodesia.  Modern Hong Kong.<p><i>Actually, I have read that book and I think you're misrepresenting Chua's thesis</i><p>It's not her thesis that's interesting, but the examples.  Most of them do involve democracy.  She tries to make her book less politically incorrect by spreading the blame on markets too, but I don't buy it.<p><i>I think the takeaway there is that democracy involves a lot more than just voting: you need to build the rule of law and emplace a whole set of norms about how power is shared amongst dissenting groups. If you ignore all that and just impose elections immediately, then yeah, things can go very badly.</i><p>If you already have a government that provides rule of law, and a good set of norms about power sharing, why change things up?<p>What makes democracy in America and Europe less pernicious is that a) its diluted a great deal by the committee system, unelected civil servants, and a permanent usually unelected judiciary. And b) there is a K-12 education system telling people not to be racist or jingoistic.",1275961310

Eventually these results could be catered based on interests rather than an algorithm that weights websites based on backlinks and only your ""search terms"" (IE: Google). Search terms + interest graph is a very powerful algorithm - especially as Facebook deploys ""like"" buttons across the internet which serve as ""votes"" similarly to how Google considers ""backlinks"" votes for a website. Also, remember that Facebook did announce the integration of Microsoft Office web apps within Facebook.<p>Things are getting interesting.<p>Facebook, while scary from a privacy standpoint, is definitely creating value and will continue to create value.",1275960222

1412683,comment,1412195,1412195,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, I don't think that's so unlikely for the United States - hear me out ;-).  2020 is 10 years away.  By the end of this year, around a third of Americans will be covered by 4G technologies.  4G technologies (in order to be considered such) must have a theoretical peak exceeding 100Mbps for mobile usage and 1Gbps for fixed usage (ie. home broadband).  Now, initially, these 4G technologies won't get anywhere near those speeds.  It will be very much like 3G where 300-400kbps was the norm, but now 1Mbps is more the norm.<p>When talking about what people see in the real world from these theoretical peaks, we can look at Verizon and Sprint who are offering a theoretical peak of 3.1Mbps and AT&T who is offering a theoretical peak of 7.2Mbps.  In real life, tests show:<p><pre><code>            Sprint  Verizon  AT&T
  PCMag     0.99M   1.01M    1.79M
  PCWorld   0.8M    0.88M    1.41M
  Gizmodo   ~0.9M   ~1.3M    ~1.4M
</code></pre>
With that data in hand, it looks like average real-world speeds come out to about 28% of peak theoretical speeds.  If that holds true in the 4G era, that would be 280Mbps of real-world speed wirelessly.  Even if they only achieve 10% of 5% of their theoretical peak, that's still 100Mbps or 50Mbps (and I think that 5% is being very conservative).<p>Now, that is clearly years away.  What wireless companies will be pushing in 2012 will likely be in the 10Mbps range for mobile devices.  However, I think it's reasonable that we might see 100Mbps broadband to more than 75% of the American population by 2020.  Some companies like Clearwire are counting on home broadband as an important source of revenue.  As customers start getting increased choice in home broadband (likely from 2 or more wireless providers), cable companies and local telcos will have to enhance their offerings to stay competitive (or maybe the economics is such that wireless makes more sense given American geography).<p>2020 is a long time away.  4G wireless technology is exciting and is promising to reach very high speeds for fixed wireless.  Wireless companies are much more competitive than telcos and cable companies with most Americans having the choice between at least 4 (and MetroPCS has been coming on strong in many urban areas to create a fifth).  Companies like Sprint/Clearwire are even thinking about making their own microwave backhauls which would eliminate a huge cost in network rollout (fiber to the site).  There's a good decade for 4G to really ratchet up the speeds before 2020 is here.  I'm hopeful.  At the very least, the competition will give a swift kick in the pants to wired providers.",1275960124

Pages like the linked that suggest otherwise are muddying the problem, because they're misunderstanding how printing works by ignoring line screening and halftoning.<p>A 300ppi screen that fits 300 pixels into an inch is exactly the same as a 300dpi printer that can fit 300 dots of its laser into an inch of drum.<p>The difference comes because screens can directly vary the colour of an individual dot. Printers can't -- ink is either present or it is not. The way you get around that is by varying the size of the dot, in a process called halftoning.<p>Halftone dots are very small, and are arranged in patterns you'll recognise if you look at newsprint photographs close-up. You measure the size of the screen in LPI -- lines per inch, the number of lines of dots (at max size) that can fit in an inch.<p>Because of the need to vary the size of the dots, on a 300dpi printer you end up with a very coarse line-screen of about 60 LPI. This looks rotten, and so printers go up to resolutions of 1200+dpi. This means you can have a linescreen of around 150lpi, which is good enough for most printing. Each line roughly equates to 2 pixels, and hence a 300ppi image is sufficient for printing, regardless of the resolution of the image or platesetter.<p>But this doesn't mean there's a difference in ppi or dpi: they're still exactly the same.",1275960049
