1474344,comment,1473844,1474183,0,0,zedshaw,,,"Honestly, it comes down to other languages not understanding how sockets, pointers, and memory really work.  When you do servers like this, that's all you're dealing with (plus parsing).  In other languages they try to hide these things away from you, or just screw up the concepts making them no easier to use.<p>For example, if you want to parse an HTTP header in Python you have to iterate through either integers, or break it up into smaller strings, or use the really bad tokenizer library.  Most languages with immutable strings make fast parsing and ""copy on write"" semantics difficult, so they're already harder to work with.<p>Another example is how they screw up sockets.  In C sockets are simple, requiring only a few function calls to work with, and then a bunch of error conditions.  Everything you get out of them is bytes put into a buffer of your choice.  In other languages you have to work with some badly designed OOP layer that makes no sense, exception <i>classes</i> for each errno, randomly sized buffers with no Chord data structure, or an event system like Twisted that gives no ring buffer or state machine functionality.<p>In the end, implementing the solid core of a web server is just easier in C.  I wouldn't want to implement a full blow web app in it, because doing something like a template system is murder (dynamic languages win hands down there).  But the core is much easier.",1277891461

I'm only having the conversation with you because you're getting it completely wrong, and yet you appear to want to learn.<p>You say:<p><pre><code>  P(blue_head OR red_head) = 1  \n      you said that you're retrying until this happens\n      normally this would be 3/4\n</code></pre>\nThis is an incorrect application of Bayes' Theorem.  The whole point of taking P(X|Y) isn't that P(Y) can be then taken as being 1.  P(Y) remains the probability of Y.  The point is that when we then only consider those events where Y occurs, then we have conditioned our probabilities, and the formula gives us what we want.  Specifically, relative to Y, the probability of X changes.<p>Using ""BH"" for ""Blue coin shows Head"" and ""RH"" for ""Red coin shows Head"" we have:<p><pre><code>    P(BH and RH | BH or RH)\n  = P(BH and RH and (BH or RH)) / P(BH or RH)\n  = P(BH and RH) / P(BH or RH)\n  = 0.25 / 0.75\n  = 1/3\n</code></pre>\nYou then go on to say:<p><pre><code>  P(BH OR RH) = P(BH) + P(RH) - P(BH) * P(RH) = 1\n</code></pre>\nTaking just the second part of this:<p><pre><code>  P(BH) + P(RH) - P(BH) * P(RH) = 1\n</code></pre>\nand adding P(BH) * P(RH) to both sides we get:<p><pre><code>  P(BH) + P(RH) = 1 + P(BH) * P(RH)\n</code></pre>\nSince by symmetry P(RH)=P(BH), and letting x=P(BH)=P(RH) this simplifies to<p><pre><code>  x + x = 1 + x^2\n</code></pre>\nThe only solution to that is x=1, so P(BH)=P(RH)=1<p>Your math is clearly screwed at this point.<p>So I've given you the correct interpretation, I've shown you where your calculations are wrong, and I've explained your incorrect use of Bayes' Formula.<p>Twice.",1277891171

1474326,comment,1473844,1474156,0,0,zedshaw,,,"Bad programmers are the cause of everything you said, not the tools they use.  For example, if you compile a language to machine code and use a linker, then I can inject memory errors and violate your view of state.  Unless you have link time assertions, your carefully crafted ""safe state free"" languages aren't.<p>""State is also a major source of error"" is an unsupported claim.  Show me <i>any</i> usability study that confirms removing state improves a programmer's source and understanding of the solution.<p>The truth is, all of the concepts of state free, type systems, assertions, and design by contract are just specific limited cases of a more flexible assertion system.  Type systems are a compile time assertion that you are getting a type you expect.  Design By Contract are runtime assertions about state of the system.  So is assert in C.  Removal of state like in Haskell is just a <i>very</i> restrictive design by contract alternative compile time assertion.<p>If all of these are specific cases of a general assertion system, then none of them cover the complete set of assertions you'd need to truly make ""safer"" software.  You'd need link time assertions (dll hashes and version required, function prototypes required), compile time assertions more flexible than types, and runtime assertions like design by contract.<p>Unless your language has all of those in an optional way (which would be a pain in the ass to use) then your language is truly no better than C.",1277890952

Foursquare can only differentiate long-term behavior of user A versus user B, and correlate that with ads, but it can't answer: how did a large advertising campaign change the long-term behavior of a large segment of society? The problem is that behavior in that case is highly correlated: the goal with brand advertising is to change general cultural perception of a product, which depends in large part on word-of-mouth and shared perceptions among social groups. You're hoping to somehow intervene into that so that in the 2010s, 7-Up will seem cool to young people (or at least, cooler than if you hadn't launched your big ad campaign).<p>So the A/B test you want can't be something as simple as: we show user A a 7-Up ad and don't show it to user B, and see if that changes 7-Up purchasing habits.<p>Rather, it's something like: in the year 2011, spend $m on brand ads trying to improve the image of 7-Up, so people think it's cool and not the red-headed step-child version of Sprite. Then, re-run that same year 2011 without spending the money, and see how much difference there was in total sales.<p>The problem, of course, is that it's really hard to rerun years. ;-) You can try it in different years, e.g. increase or decrease your ad budget in 2012 relative to 2011, and see if it has an effect. But then you have to find some way to control for the fact that 2012 is different than 2011 in a lot of other ways too, not to mention that it follows 2011 so isn't independent of it, which makes it hard to draw any firm conclusions about which level of ad spending had what effects.",1277890116

Although I do know there are mature and more than capable languages available, I'd really love to learn how to do it and understand the processes involved.<p>I'm just wondering if any one had any suggestions for resources and literature, which would be useful and beneficial for learning this sort of stuff. Also, if you have any general advice or suggestions to help me a long the way, that'd be much appreciated too.<p>As I said, I know that it seems like I'm reinventing the wheel but this is my idea of fun and I'm sure most of you are the same (I'm assuming a lot there though)! Nothing beats getting home at night and having an all-night hacking session in my opinion!<p>Anyway, much thanks for taking notice and thanks in advance for any replies. Also, I apologise for any spelling, grammar and/or punctuation mistakes. I've been up all night playing around in C, so I guess it's understandable haha!<p>James.",1277888482
