1464448,comment,1462680,1464390,0,0,natrius,,,"MRIs are cheap in Japan because the Japanese government will only pay so much for them. As a result, there is less of an incentive for people to develop new imaging technologies since the government will similarly limit the profit that can be made from them. That doesn't mean that innovation in that field will stop, especially since more profit can still be made in other countries. The pace of innovation is just likely to be slower.<p>I didn't say incomes were rising. I said <i>disposable</i> incomes are rising. I can't find data to back that up, especially since the economic definition is different from the colloquial meaning of ""disposable income."" However, it's clear that technology has made both the necessities and luxuries of life far cheaper over time, which leaves more money for us to spend on other things even with a stagnant income.",1277592877

1464446,comment,1462258,1463468,0,0,mkramlich,,,"We agree that rates are weird and relativistic. Myself I've seen $50/hour described as too high, and $100 as too low (<i>head explodes</i>), and I've been treated alternately as both overqualified and underqualified for doing some technical thing that I know I could certainly do. Also seen and heard that bidding low will increase the chance of getting a gig as well as decrease the chance (for some clients), and, and, and... It's just crazy inconsistent and relative.<p>There's also the ""all developers are the same, therefore commodity pricing is in effect"" phenomenon which is annoying to encounter. And the ""just tell me rate, because I know exactly how many hours this will take, and no other factor matters"" phenomenon. Crazy stuff.<p>One good takeaway from the Lee article I had was that if you set a really high rate, even if you scare away a lot of people, all it takes is 1 client to agree to that, billing anywhere from 1 to a few hours in a given month, and you're in the holy ""Ramen profitable"" zone. Well, able to cover food and shelter anyway. But then you'll have <i>tons</i> of free time and energy leftover for other activities.",1277592775

1464436,comment,1464306,1464306,0,0,compumike,,,"This kind of server monitoring is exactly why we wrote and released <a href=""http://www.nerdkits.com/files/notifo/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nerdkits.com/files/notifo/</a> two months ago (although our server monitoring component itself hasn't been released). We don't use it for payment notifications as the screenshot might suggest, as that would get annoying very quickly!  Instead, my co-founder and I get notifo alerts when anything might be out-of-bounds: daemons not running, load averages, memory usage, DNS/web test queries, various queues, etc. This gets tied in with our internal business dashboard, so we can see warnings before they get to the ""failed"" state that triggers a notifo, or usually just see a bunch of nice green checkmarks underneath our sales stats!<p>Honestly, after running it for 2+ months, the problem is that it's been <i>too</i> sensitive, so recently the progress has been in adding logic to make it ignore and/or fix and/or retry without notifying us at all.  For example, if one of our secondary nameservers is unreachable, my script knows that I don't care, but it will let me know if two or more are down -- and only after trying a few times.  And if our Asterisk instance can't talk to our SIP provider, then it will instruct Asterisk to try to reconnect.  Another example is in our Django FastCGI processes restarting after serving a bunch of queries (to reduce the effect of process memory growth / leaks): if our script does its checks at that time, it may notice one extra or one fewer process running, so it will wait a few seconds and then check again.<p>At the end of the day, while notifo is only a small piece of the code at this point, it's a core feature that motivated this ""autotester"" server monitoring script and makes it a must-have for us.  We've had it running for long enough that we have fairly good test coverage for all of the moving parts of our server, and over the last few weeks have been able to write some smarts into it so that the frequency of Notifo alerts is small enough that they're usually worth looking into.<p>From a business perspective: This lets my co-founder and I sleep much better and have our mind off of server operations when traveling.  That's a real benefit.  Thanks, Notifo!",1277592255

As an example, if this was a fighting game, a user could make it such that it's much easier to win against one of these bots than it would to win against another real player. How would you solve this problem? Would you find a way to block bots in the first place? Or, perhaps, you'd look to make the match-ups truly random?

1464423,comment,1464116,1464201,0,0,scott_s,,,"That's a good approach, but sometimes you can't do it in C++. (At least with C++03.) Consider:<p><pre><code>  template <class T>\n  T* new_align_1d(size_t d1, unsigned int align)\n  {\n    void* ptr = _malloc_align(d1 * sizeof(T), align);\n    return new (ptr) T[d1];\n  }\n</code></pre>\nSo, I'm defining a function <i>new_align</i> that takes a size and an alignment. I allocate enough space for a 1-dimensional array of the given size on that alignment, then use the placement operator to construct the actual objects in that place. Then return the pointer. Pretty straightforward. So let's generalize one dimension up:<p><pre><code>  template <class T, size_t d2>\n  ? new_align_2d(size_t d1, unsigned int align)\n  {\n    void* ptr = _malloc_align(d1 * d2 * sizeof(T), align);\n    return new (ptr) T[d1][d2];\n  }\n</code></pre>\nYou can probably see what I'm doing here. So what's the return type? And what's the syntax for specifying it? Since it's a template, we can't define a typedef to help us. (C++0x should allow that with parameterized typedefs.) The answer surprised me - I really had to look at the grammar and mechanically figure out what it was going to be.<p>(Yes, I have to pass d2 as a template parameter - it's part of the type of the array and must be known at compile time.)",1277591704

For simple things, this works kind of nicely:<p><pre><code>    char *foo;\n</code></pre>\nSays that *foo will have type `char`. This sounds good in theory, but famously breaks down when things get more complicated (arrays of function pointers, multiple declarations at once, &c.).",1277590685

Then the data that would pass between objects is encapsulated in its own (very simple) class.<p>Edit:  I didn't parse the ""ouch"" the first time I read this.  Sorry, I'm not trying to be an ass about it.  But when I first started trying to figure out the ""right"" way to do it, I came across something (probably by Allen Holub) that confirmed something I was suspicious about:  There is no sense in having a private variable if you are just going to expose it with public getters and setters (except for sanitation purposes).  The real point was to pass in the data through data objects, and keep the private members unexposed.  This also means (typically, at least for me) a <i>lot</i> fewer getters and setters.  It's completely against the Java Beans ""way,"" I think, but it works well in real life.  I use Java Beans only for persistence, because I like the automatic JB-xml conversion.  That is, I make data objects out of the data that I want to store into a Java Bean, and do the automatic xml storage and read thing.  It took me a while to figure that out.  My first app, I hand-coded the xml.  Ugh.",1277590636

I have a car but don't pay for the insurance (though I do pay for repairs, gas, etc.) so $1500 is definitely doable. Rent for a single person can be had for $300-$400 with some looking, and not necessarily in bad conditions. $500 will get you plenty of space. You will likely need the car, though the town bus system is very good (supposedly one of the best small-town public transit systems in the country). It's a college town so you have a younger population than some rural communities--it's not quite ""truck stop"", in other words, but having a large student population has its own problems. There are quiet parts of town, where families and grad students tend to live, but the ""student ghettos"" have loud parties, crappy apartments, and predatory lending practices aplenty.<p>The next town over, Moscow, ID, is about 8 miles east. It's also a college town, plus it has a nicer downtown (complete with hippie food co-op). Haven't lived there, though.<p>If you like variable weather, where the temperature goes from -10 to 110 over the course of the year and you see wind, rain, snow, hail, and sunshine in the course of about the same week, you'll like the area. Speaking of seasons, summers are a lot nicer and quieter than the school year, at least in Pullman.<p>Not sure I'd recommend living here to anyone, to be honest, but if you want to feel isolated from the real world for awhile it'll do the job.",1277589862
