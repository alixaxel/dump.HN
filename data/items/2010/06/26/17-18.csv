1463988,comment,1463425,1463939,0,0,zephyrfalcon,,,"(Disclaimer: Not meant as flamebait)<p>Not to be a prick, but if you're having ""typing"" problems with Python, you're using it wrong.<p>Types are almost irrelevant in Python. What matters is whether, in a given situation, the method you're calling is supported and does what is intended. The actual type/class of the receiving object doesn't really matter, ditto for any arguments you pass to the method.<p>While this may seem highly unsafe and brittle, it has important benefits. You can just hack up some code that ""just works"" in a few minutes, without having to sacrifice a goat to the compiler first, making sure that all the correct types are specified, subclasses are defined, interfaces are implemented completely, etc. The rigid type systems in other languages often require this and more; making changes to your software becomes a chore. Rapid prototyping this is not.<p>In Python, when used correctly, you don't have this problem. Write a bit of code, write a test, run it, and decide what to do next. Ideal for testing out ideas. It doesn't work? Throw that shit out and write something else; two minutes later you'll be testing your new code again. Yes, you do need to have unit tests, but the same is (or should really be) true for most languages. Just because something compiles, doesn't mean that it does what you want. (Except maybe in Haskell. :-)<p>Interestingly, the quickly-written prototype might well be good enough to become the actual production code, with some additions. Just keep you tests up-to-date, for reasonable use cases, and there's no reason why your code shouldn't work in real life. Sure, that function foo(x) that wants to call x.bar() will fail if you call it with an x that doesn't support the bar() method. So don't do that, then! ;-)<p>Anyway, to summarize, I personally would much rather have Python's flexibility, paired with unit testing, than Java's lack of flexibility paired with compiler checks.",1277574787

That will get you high quality care at low prices today, but the future quality of health care will be lower than it would've been otherwise.<p>If there's too much surgery going on, that can be fixed without a single-payer system. My point about the value we place on health care is that even if we fixed all the problems with health care in America, we'd end up paying more than countries with single-payer systems because those systems force the price down below what people would be willing to pay on their own.

1463983,comment,1445519,1454659,0,0,carbocation,,,">That is an unfair charge<p>No, it's completely fair. We have objective criteria for evaluating ""best"", and expert opinion is Grade C evidence (different groups use different lettering conventions, but suffice it to say that expert opinion is not regarded highly since it is, in fact, not evidence).<p>>Citation?<p>Looking at only those <i>without</i> CVD at time of enrollment, see <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/pubmed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/pubmed</a> (70,000 participants in that meta-analysis alone).<p>LDL is not VLDL. LDL-C is different from VLDL measures. Since this isn't that popularly known, let me explain a bit: people rarely measure LDL-C directly. Instead, they assume that virtually all serum TG is carried by VLDL; they measure HDL; and then they infer LDL-C. It turns out that this inferred LDL-C correlates well enough with directly measured LDL-C for the vast majority of people that it hasn't been worth the cost of implementing a direct test except for research purposes (Canadians will differ on this).<p>I'm not exactly sure where you are going with the VLDL vs LDL discussion, however, since VLDL is the precursor to LDL. It is always a formal possibility that a confounder is modifying or even inverting the relationship between X and Y, but typically one would expect some evidence in support of that. The LDL-MI association holds up in every population tested - so unless this postulated confounder is present in every population, it's not likely. Plus, most people expect that both VLDL and LDL will correlate with MI risk, though the best studied one is LDL.<p>>You did not address the Agatston score point, which iirc was the main rebuttal I'd made to your earlier comment. As this discussion is threatening to run off on another tangent, I will end here.<p>My point isn't that the Agatston score is bad; it's that you're rejecting the intermediate endpoint with the best evidence (LDL-C, which has prospective randomized trials supporting it) and then endorsing an intermediate endpoint that's far less accepted (coronary calcification). I rebutted your Agatston score comment in a couple of ways previously and without actual evidence supporting its importance <i>in the causal chain for MI</i>, I see it merely as a biomarker (unlike LDL-C, which is causal).<p>>Perhaps GCBC may itself be compelling?<p>No. Since the GCBC is a book that expresses its author's expert opinion, I do not find it to be evidence. When I hear ""evidence,"" I expect data, not opinion.",1277574436

I used XStream for it, and started off trying to write the objects the ""right"" way, i.e. with private members for child nodes and getters and setters for them. However, having drank deep of the Python well, I got about 20 minutes into it before I realised that my time was better spent writing the actual logic of the app and did a :s/private/public/g.

When hating on Perl came into vogue on the internet, I said to myself, okay, I will learn Python as a Perl replacement.  It is a decent Perl replacement, what with all the libraries and the fact that it is shebang-able.<p>Now that I've dispensed with background, what I don't like about Python:<p>1. Assignments don't return values. I <i>hate</i> this.  An example.  I would like to write:<p><pre><code>    if (m = re.match(""woo, regular expression"")):\n        do some stuff with match object\n</code></pre>\nInstead<p><pre><code>    m = re.match(""woo, regular expression"")\n    if m:\n        do some stuff with match object\n</code></pre>\nThis obscures the fact that I only care about this match object if it evaluates to true.<p>2. List comprehensions kind of suck.  [(a, b) for a in as for b in bs] is a <i>cartesian product</i> and not a zip?  Really?<p>3. Loops don't help this either: There's no equivalent of the Lisp (loop for x in xs for y in ys do (stuff x y)).  I have to explicitly loop over the index.  This pisses me off.<p>4. I feel that I am generally shoehorned into creating and assigning more objects than I would like.<p>Honestly it seems kinda crippled in comparison to Lisp, which, by the way, <i>runs faster</i>.<p>I would go back to Perl if multidimensional arrays were not so godawful.

1463964,comment,1463425,1463425,0,0,zephyrfalcon,,,"I've been using Python since around 1996. Back then I had used, or was still using, C, C++, Turbo Pascal, Delphi, BASIC (groan) and assembler.<p>Python was so much more high-level than all these other languages that it was staggering. It was pretty weird to use it at first. Where are all the declarations? What are these ""lists"" and ""dictionaries""? You mean I can just stick any old thing in an object or even a class? Etc.<p>Soon it became obvious how much more powerful this new language was, and I enjoyed replacing reams of Pascal/C code with a few lines of Python. I tried to use it at work too, but failed because it was considered ""unmaintainable"" by the powers that were (this was around 1999-2000). Of course, this just fueled the feeling of having an obscure but superior language rebelling against the big evil statically typed empire. :-)<p>Anyway, this used to be some of the appeal of Python. I suppose it still applies to some extent, although since then, Python has been passed left and right by languages that are more powerful, more flexible, more functional, more ""fun"", and whatnot. Nowadays there seems to be a meme going around claiming that e.g. Ruby is fun and flexible, while by contrast Python is boring and conservative. It wasn't always like that. I distinctly recall people discovering Python and exclaiming that ""programming is FUN again!"".<p>Then again, all of these things are in the eye of the beholder, mostly. If you don't like Python, no big deal, especially if you have both lower-level (C, C++) and higher-level (Lisp) languages at your disposal. (Personally, I used to think that Ruby was butt-ugly and uninteresting... these days, I have taken more of a liking to the spirit of the Ruby community, which (perhaps ironically) reminds me of Python's in the 1990s.)",1277573724

When a feature needs to be demoed on Friday morning for the large contract to be closed you do what needs to be done to get something that runs and promise yourself you'll fix it when you have time (yet knowing that that time may never come).  You know what you did is objectively bad, but you know that to do it objectively better would take longer (probably because it would require you to fix some other rushed part of the code produced under similar circumstances).",1277572407

Most people know that it's tough competition on those type of sites.<p>Link with sites that just serve job listings. ex: startuply and others.<p>On another note, allow those who make paid screencasts to advertise on your site. integrate some kind of reddit-type self serve ads that show up on specific screencast's pages. Would be cool.<p>ex: I make ActiveRecord screencasts so i choose some pages on your site which display activerecord screencasts and choose to display my ads only on those pages :) this way you show related content too :)",1277571968
