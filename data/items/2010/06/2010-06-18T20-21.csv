It's a left-wing activist organization.<p>You can't have it both ways. You're either one or the other.<p>The notion that Wikileaks was in some way obligated to ""market"" this material is nonsense. Virtually anyone else in the world could have contributed the ""marketing"" once the material was out there. There was no need whatsoever for Wikileaks to trade its credibility for promotional value. The only motivation I can detect behind it doing so is, again, that Julian Assange wanted to get on TV.",1276894767

What am I missing here? Is it that you think that Greenwald doesn't recognize or understand ingrained and universal bias?<p>Is it that you think Wikileaks should simply not have any opinions and only relay the facts? I guess that might be an improvement in the sense that they don't impart an incomplete or biased narrative? Isn't that called marketing? Should activists not market? Only information-related activists? Which activists are not in the information business anyway? Is activism within the media inherently and broadly frustrating to you too?<p>There's some piece of information missing I think that connects the dots of why humans at Wikileaks having opinions and marketing them is frustrating to you.<p>ITN news from the U.K. used to have a policy of impassive presentation of the facts. I loved it. But not many people watch ITN news, in fact I think they've gone away or changed or something because it wasn't viable or something of the sort, I need to look that up.",1276894478

My main drobo backup is automatically versioned and backed up every 12 hours (to a single external drive, since I don't need to back up everything on my drobo).

And of course occasionally I test whether or not my backup is actually backing up the things I want and that I can successfully restore from it.<p>If I back up bad data, I have older but good data to recover from. If my drobo catastrophically fails, at the worst I've lost data that is probably not going to be difficult to replicate/replace because of how new it is. I don't have to start ripping my hair out at the idea of having lost an incredible amount of data ranging from irreplaceable photos of my life to work and more.<p>In the ideal case, raid should increase reliability, and they do, only for one definition of reliability.
