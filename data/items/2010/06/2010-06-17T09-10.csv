If someone left one off their resume I might ask out of curiosity, but I doubt I would think about it beyond that.<p>I used to run a PR agency. In that kind of work, a person's 'presence' is the most important thing, so I would just talk to them until I got a feel for them. If I were to hire a developer, I would ask what projects they had finished and I would try to establish if 'they code even when they don't have to'. I really think you need to be addicted to something as complicated as programming if you're going to be effective.<p>If I could do it all over again, I would take 1/5 of the money I (and my parents) spent on a largely worthless 'private school' education and start a business. Even if you fail, repeatedly, the lessons you learn would be invaluable.<p>I actually encourage you to drop out of school. Not so that you can follow some completely unstructured path down a beery slope or anything, but so that you truly take your future into your own hands and spend all of your time becoming what you want to become.<p>Good luck!",1276768787

It's just that these factors do not dominate. At the other end of the scale Apple is trying very hard to stop iPhones becoming commodities by stopping cross platform Flash apps, not allowing access to iTunes etc. which prevents similar devices from other manufacturers being swapped in without disruption.

Here's how I did it with a similar service of mine. Define a keyword search (e.g. ""g hello world"" - Google Search, ""s hello world"" - add a note), in Opera it's trivial - right-click the text area, select Create Search, and pick a keyword, I guess in other browsers it's doable too. The POST request carries the name of the page and a note to be added. It might sound simple, obvious, useless, but try it and there's a chance you'll love it.<p>3. List of my pages in the sidebar.
