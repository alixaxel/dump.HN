1410553,comment,1409721,1409721,0,0,kordless,,,"Brad worked for me at Zoto for about 6 months back in 2006 or so.  I found him fiercely intellectual.<p>He moved to Oklahoma from England where he said he had been living with his mom.  Because the driving age is 17 there, he hadn't gotten his license yet.  I took to picking him up from the house and then letting him drive my car to the office so he could log time for his driver's permit.<p>One day he accidentally ran a stop sign, directly in the path of another car.  I ended up shouting something like ""Stop Brad!"" at him, and reaching over and touching him on the arm as we squealed to a stop.  What resulted was something I never had observed in a person before.  He literally shut completely down, and for a about 5 minutes just sat there with his eyes closed, breathing.  I tried getting his attention, but he was completely catatonic.  I pulled the parking brake, and put the car in park because I had no idea what was going on with him.<p>I ended up asking him to leave Zoto a few months later, because of this and other bizarre incidences, which I chalked mostly up to being a young kid coming from a split marriage.  I'm still not exactly sure what caused his strange behaviors, but it makes me sad to see that he went and straightened his life out, only to have all this happen to him.<p>:(",1275919114

Not even after military training.<p>> he took specific oaths to protect his country and his fellow soldier.<p>Couldn't politically sabotaging this war (by leaking embarrassing videos and criminal backdoor political deals) be interpreted as making his country and colleagues safer by sending them home sooner? The invasion of Iraq is totally wrong, messed-up thing that in a reasonable world would never happen. Iraq was a mess before the war, but now it is a huge bombed-back-to-stone-age mess that badly needs cleaning. And I doubt a continued invading force can help with that. What Iraq needs is schools, law enforcement, separation of church and state, a functioning, modern, justice system and, hopefully, in one or two generations they will be back where they could be five years ago had a competent intervention been executed.<p>I am not advocating treason and I am not going into his apparently childish motives. It's unclear if people would really die from his actions. If you leak supply-run schedules for two months in the future, this hardly puts any lives in danger - the schedules just have to be changed (and if it becomes known the schedules were leaked, it creates a good opportunity to expose your military opposition)<p>As far as crimes go this whole war is an endless supply of them. If the US had to invade someone else random for what Afghanistan was supporting, it could as well be Mexico. It would, at least, make shipping tanks easier.

If you have ax^2+bx+c=0 and you use x=(-b+/-sqrt(b^2-4ac))/(2a) then you run into stability problems if ac is very small and ""a"" is small.  Then the sqrt is close to b, so for one choice on the numerator you get the subtraction of nearly equal values, giving rubbish.  Then you divide by a small number and get big rubbish.<p>The solution in this case is to get the root where the numerator is close to 2b, and derive the second root from the first.

1410444,comment,1409721,1410395,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Thank you for the sincere comment and I respect your position - a lot of the usage of the death penalty is really morally questionable in my eyes, things like executing people who are barely mentally competent and making a big dog and pony show out of it. That sort of thing doesn't seem like it'd reduce crime or give any real feeling of closure to a victim, or really accomplish much at all. So I respect your position.<p>If you think the death penalty is wrong, full stop, then I guess it's just agree to disagree because I think there are times when it's appropriate - though, like I said, I respect your position. But if you'll ask the question of, ""If there's a death penalty available for prosecutors, when should they seek it?"" I'm not convinced that the answer to that is just when the person does obviously horrifying things.<p>Put like this - I have an expression that goes, ""Satan urinates on toilet seats."" I don't actually believe in Satan, mind you, what I mean is - I think evil originates less from bad motives like you see in the movies and more from people being careless, reckless, and leaving a mess. Most people are careful in a clean public bathroom, but once it gets a little messy, it gets <i>really</i> messy really fast. So I always imagined that, if there's a Satan, he goes around being the first one to pee on a clean toilet seat. Then all the decent people who would normally not make a mess both have to stay further away from the now-dirty bathroom, and care less if they make more of a mess.<p>So by punishing this man for very casually, unthinkingly sharing very important information and risking lives, I think he's absolutely culpable. If there's any place where the death penalty could dissuade people, or get them thinking more, it's here.<p>So a someone in military intelligence who thinks about leaking classified material has to ask themselves, ""Is this important that I'm willing to die to leak it?"" And thus, I don't think it'd suppress people who come across something really, really bad. But this guy was talking about dumping classified material wantonly on an anonymous server. People <i>were</i> going to die as a result of his actions. I wouldn't be for seeking the death penalty based on just the video of the helicopter incident, but all sorts of material just for the hell of it?<p>And on top of that, he took specific oaths to protect his country and his fellow soldier. He wasn't conscripted. He wasn't a random kid playing around on the internet. He volunteered to join the armed forces, and then he was trained and instructed before he become an intelligence analyst. He would've had a choice if he wanted go into that role in the armed forces, and he would've been instructed repeatedly that sharing classified information could kill his fellow servicemen and women.<p>I agree with you that there could be some much-needed security improvements as a result of his actions, but it's not like some kid was hacking around on servers from the internet, this is a man who carefully planned to bring materials into an area sealed off from the internet and sneak the information out. He's smart enough to steal classified information, but he's either reckless or ambivalent to the fact that people are very likely to die as a result of his actions.<p>If you seek the death penalty for this, you send a clear message that risking a fellow serivemen's and innocent civillians' lives haphazardly for a thrill is considered the highest of crimes and deserves the highest of punishments. I respect your position on the death penalty in general, but if you have a death penalty, I think this is just about as bad of a crime as a member of the armed forces can commit.",1275916021

I mean, if they put in a good cover letter explaining that they recognize that they don't seem to match the qualifications, but explaining why they want a shot at an interview, or something like that, fine.... but they don't.""<p>How did they get an interview?  You don't interview everyone who applies.  And if they don't put in a good cover letter, and the resume doesn't look good, why bother?<p>If they have technical skills that need dealing with, there are other ways to go about testing those technical skills quickly and without an interview process.",1275915663
