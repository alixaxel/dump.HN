There were tons of smartphones available before the iPhone that let you install any software that you wanted.  My first smartphone was the Sony Ericsson P800 and it was released in 2002!  I had to change carriers to use to, too.<p>The original iPhone was a great device with a wonderful interface, but it wasn't the invention of the smartphone.  It did, however, sell the mainstream consumer market on smartphones.

Did some of them have trouble getting their questions answered?  Nobody lost as much sleep over those questions as they did over their thesis defense.  See #1.<p>3. Most student questions are about BS that's irrelevant to learning. What's on the test?  Do we have to read all of chapter 7?  Why did you take ten points off on problem four?  What font and spacing do you want me to use on the write-up?<p>I agree that formal education can change a student's world when it's done right.  I don't think our current system rises to meet that standard very often.  In part that's because it's easy to ignore real problems by thinking about the ideal.  University education can be better than it is now, and competition from less formal learning can help it get there.",1275873693

Debt has to paid off and you can't just take it on endlessly. I wonder what the future looks like if the United States continues to take on more and more debt. Right now we can't really pay it off ever so we're stuck servicing it forever. Seems like we're giving our children a much worse world than the one we were born in. When I was born the debt was pretty manageable and over the course of my lifetime it exploded to something that's basically never going to be paid off.",1275873638
