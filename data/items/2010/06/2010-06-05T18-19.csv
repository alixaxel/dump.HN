He is not sitting around and doing calculations or running analyses with fancy algorithms.<p>Instead, he is amazing at risk management. He knows precisely when to 'go for the jugular' and bet really big.<p>It's a really instinctual type thing, he can gauge the psychology of the market really well and understand when bubbles are about to pop.<p>The other great thing about Soros is that he has a remarkably open mind. There is a story about how Soros went and played tennis with someone, at the time, he had a big trade betting on one direction of the market. The person he played tennis with was vehemently against that position and expressed his concern.<p>The next day the market turned opposite to Soros' trade and his tennis partner called, to see if he was doing okay, thinking that Soros must have lost a lot of money that day. But, he was greeted with a happy George Soros who reported that after the tennis match he totally changed the direction of his trade.<p>It is pretty rare to find people, especially in financial markets, who can quickly change directions and basically admit that they were originally wrong. Trading is a business that is dominated by people with huge egos, but you will notice that most of the best traders are ones that will switch direction without hesitation.",1275764219
1407263,comment,1407016,1407233,0,0,tptacek,,,"You have in reality no such benefit. From my cursory research, taxpayers have consistently lost every case in which they attempted to hide wages as distros. Courts have held that ""wages"" is a term that describes all remuneration for services rendered in any form. Even loans from the company to shareholders can, under the tax code, be reclassified by the IRS as FICA-eligible wages.<p>The only benefit S-Corp shareholders have under the present system is that they can force the IRS to audit to recover this money, which is a game that entrepreneurs often win because very few people really get audited anyways.<p>So, two things. First, the loophole doesn't really simplify your life. For many years after filing one of these bogus returns, you can still be levied for the hidden wages, plus penalties (including a huge extra negligence penalty). Second, there's nothing fair or sensible about the exemption S-Corp shareholders are taking; people with exactly the same skin in the economy have to pay FICA, so why shouldn't S-Corp owners?",1275764203

As for the remaining business income, each shareholder would still owe taxes based on how much of the business they own. This is different than a C-Corp where the business income would be taxed at the corporate level in addition to the owners paying income tax on their salaries. And if the owners of a C-Corp decided to pay themselves huge dividends to avoid normal income taxation, that would raise red flags.<p>In California, S-Corps pay a 1.5% franchise tax on net income (minimum $800).

It doesn't use callables at all. the orig_commute function, the original commute method on class Ref, gets passed a monkey-patched ruby Proc object that implements the invoke method which takes one argument, a list, containing all of the original ruby arguments. Clojure then most likely calls invoke inside orig_commute through reflection. The end result: a bunch of hackery specific to Ruby and Clojure, something JVM-level closures would help eliminate.<p>Again, you cannot pass a ruby function expecting arguments to Clojure!

1407239,comment,1406947,1406947,0,0,looprecur,,,"No. Poverty is overrated.<p>It sounds like his argument for ""poverty"" is that investors micromanage and sink companies. The obvious solution is hands-off VC and more trust of entrepreneurs. In other words, we need to move away from a culture in which VCs are high priests and entrepreneurs (unless they've ""completed an exit"") are seen as unwashed beggars.<p>Also, investors can be a pain in the ass if you're funded; most people know at least one entrepreneur who was sunk or scumbagged by a bad investor. They can also be a pain in the ass if you're not; getting them is a miserable endeavor I wouldn't wish on anyone, and although someone who hasn't invested in you can't fire you, obviously, he can black-ball you (investors talk to each other).<p><i>And a founder is far more likely to drive a company toward profitability if he’s is about to lose his life’s savings.</i><p>Meh. I don't disagree at a 180-degree tack-- maybe 160. I think ""the stick"" is a pretty bad motivator overall, and when people get panicked, they make bad decisions. Everyone's different, but in the aggregate, people perform better if the potential personal loss is reduced; that's much of why limited liability exists. This is true in small as well as large companies. We all know that small companies tend to be more innovative, but that's in spite of the small company's insecurity, not because of it.<p><i>Capital starvation leads to innovation. Slim bank accounts are the best way to motivate sales people. So don’t worry if you think you don’t have enough capital. Instead, be grateful for your sense of urgency.</i><p>Disagree. Bad financial situations and anxiety lead people to take greater risks and make decisions that it's harder to make in a ""cozy"" corporate job, not because comfort leads to mediocrity but because the corporate strings often hamstring or extinguish greatness.<p>Sometimes those risky decisions turn out to produce results that are really good for the person making them, and for society. Sometimes the results are terrible. On the whole and for most people, ""the stick"" is not a very good and definitely not a very productive thing. Exceptions exist-- final fantasies that produce something great (actually, <i>Final Fantasy</i> was so-named because it was produced by, and actually saved, a dying game company)-- but those are rare.<p>Don't get me wrong: startups are great, but I think the poverty and urgency are necessary evils of the game, not benefits. We need startups in this economy, because what was once accomplished by blue-sky R&D (which doesn't exist anymore) is now increasingly done by startups, which are acquired if successful.<p>Also, don't get me started on <i>urgency</i>. Bosses in large companies play the ""urgent"" card with artificial deadlines all the time, so a lot of people work under a state of urgency. Does the OP have an idea how many millions, if not billions, of lines of absolutely terrible code have been written in the name of <i>urgency</i>?",1275763491

Besides increasing tax burden, this bill will also make the tax-filing process a bit more cumbersome for s-corp founders.<p>If HR 4123 goes through, the tax-benefit will be removed for S-corp founders.

That's why despite all the gangsters in LA, they just sell drugs instead of taking over Hollywood by force and trying to profit from the film industry. Even when gangsters take something over in this country, it's through infiltration rather than mounting a physical invasion of the city.<p>African gangsters (better known as ""rebels"", ""paramilitary groups"", etc.), on the other hand, can actually take over a diamond mine or something and collect all of the income relatively quickly. Crush the demand for diamonds, and the diamond-rich parts of Africa become that much more stable just because they'll have to work harder to generate wealth. And then, maybe, it won't be worthwhile for the paramilitaries and rebels to attack it.",1275762116

1407199,comment,1407016,1407016,0,0,tptacek,,,"<i>GOOD</i>. The dividend/payroll split trick that S-Corps play is a huge scam.<p>Normal people in normal jobs --- hell, ace (non-founder) devs at startups taking W2 wages --- have most of their income subject to payroll taxes (most notably FICA). These taxes are a significant chunk of all your withholdings.<p>However, if you and your partners own an S-Corp, you can choose to pay yourself not only in direct wages but also as cash distributions (think ""profit sharing""). Unlike wages, distros are not subject to payroll taxes. You can skip out on your FICA payments for all the income you elect to pay as a distro.<p>In an LLC, <i>all</i> of a company principal's income is paid as distros (you can't formally be an LLC principal and take W2 wages). But that income is all subject to self-employment tax. It's only in the weird little blip between LLC and C-Corp that this tax avoidance trick exists.<p>There is no legitimate reason why an LLC principal should have to fully fund Medicare and Social Security, and a C-Corp director should have to fully fund Medicare and Social Security, but an S-Corp shareholder should be able to carve out some (or even <i>most</i>) of their income to avoid those taxes.<p>To my eyes, this is a loophole in the purest sense of the word, and I'd be happy to see them kill it.",1275761387
