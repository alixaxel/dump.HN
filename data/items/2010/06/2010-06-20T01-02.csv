Have a fully functioning UI that the user can touch and feel before you develop the back end. This will flesh out all data requirements and business logic services that will be needed to support the UI.<p>I am a little leery of not allowing the developer to provide input though.

I read a news story earlier this year about a team which was using that technique to restore old phonograph records that are too fragile to play.  They even used it to successfully reconstruct the audio from fragments a record that had <i>already shattered</i>.  In the article (I forget now whether it was on NPR or Wired) they mention that the software is flexible enough to follow a linear stream whether the line wraps around a flat record or a cylindrical gramophone; likely it'd work on this medium as well.<p>(I can readily imagine 80 years from now, when they want to reconstruct the audio from an old CD, they'll take a picture of it from 3 feet away with a digital camera and it would be able to resolve the pits on the CD into a data stream.)<p>Many engineers have a tendency to ""imprint on"" a certain set of technologies and keep tools in their mental toolbox from early in their career.  Even most brilliant engineers will do this - technology moves very fast and using the tools you know saves time and effort up front even if new technologies exists that are less time long term.  I'd never dream of belittling the hard work they obviously must have done to reconstruct this pallophotophone, but I do notice that in the picture from the article the engineer is not young, and I do think it likely he built a mechanical device only because that's what he knows.  If a millennial were doing this project, absolutely he'd try it with software first.  But my generation can't be too smug because we're not immune to the effect.  Maybe the next generation from now would (to give a random example) first think of growing a piece of biological wetware to do it.",1276998477

If it is set to ""good"", then the morally-correct neural programs are automatically activated, producing a moral outcome, or at least a valiant attempt interrupted by bad luck.<p>""If you think that going to the bank, doing your laundry, and answering emails in a timely manner is some sort of accomplishment or difficult, ...""<p>In reality, the actions of the human brain appear to be directed by a complicated network of multiple pattern matchers that search for salient input.  When one of them recognizes a pattern with sufficient intensity, it produces an output that directs attention and activity toward it.  These pattern matchers vary across the population.  Some people are entranced by music, some by tidiness, some by praise, some by chasing tail, some by financial work that they have been told needs to be done, etc. etc. etc.<p>There appear to be pattern matchers that work on thought itself, sustaining attention to an idea so that it spontaneously stays somewhere near the focus of attention with little perceived effort.  This facility appears to vary <i>a lot</i> between people.  Some people get stuck (obsessive-compulsive disorder), most folks remember the more important things most of the time, and for some people holding onto a thought is like trying to catch smoke.  Studies of twins separated at birth show that this facility is about as heritable as adult height.<p>""Going to the bank is hard?!?!?""<p>Going is easy, but for some people it simply does not spontaneously float into the focus of attention.  If the police aren't about the come asking awkward questions, if the person has enough folding money for food, and so forth, then it readily slips out their conscious mind.  They'd rather it did not, but a weak meta-mind cannot readily fix itself with meta-thinking.<p>I fall on the easily-distracted-by-shiny-objects end of the spectrum.  Somewhere around here I have a $50 refund check that I've had for <i>ages</i>.  The cops don't care, nothing gets turned off if I ignore it, so it keeps falling off the radar.  It will probably continue to be forgotten until it has more value as a collectible.  One of my descendants will euphorically sell it for Federation credits and then promptly misplace their credit chip.  They will feel really guilty, but this will not help them find their credit chip.<p>""I choose to be responsible because my kids can't do their own laundry or buy their own groceries.""<p>Try choosing to be irresponsible for three straight weeks.  Your kids will not be harmed by a few weeks of nachos and slightly-dirty clothes.  I bet you couldn't do it.  The salience detector in your brain would scream and you would be compelled to obsessively fix it, regardless of your previous ""choice"" to prove you could, and your brain's storyteller would then cook up a story about how you really meant to do laundry all along.",1276996020

Drug makers are only required to show that the drug is effective for six weeks, and the FDA lets them wash out placebo responders. Also, the drug companies lie their asses off about the safety and efficacy of the drugs in order to get them approved, and they bury the studies that don't support their position. The number of independent, scientifically rigorous studies on the long term safety and efficacy of these drugs is tiny.",1276995784

1445620,comment,1438489,1442606,0,0,jodrellblank,,,"Don't put me on a pedestal or anything; my so called ""years of experience"" cover my first decade of adulthood, basically being ""a loser"" or at least not developing a lot of potentially good opportunities.<p>It's only in the last three months or so that I've found this approach, which is PJ Eby's work.<p>I don't know what to say about it - I could (edit: will!) write a lot about it, but since I'm so new to it it might not be accurate or present it well, but I'll try and summarize, and I can link you to some more good stuff (see below).<p>Anyway, the main bits are an overview of how humans learn behaviour: we animals have brains to model the world around us and predict when situations are going to be good or bad for our survival. Those parts of our brain signal using feelings - we get alert and nervous at a sharp twig snap, spooked when all the noises around us suddenly stop, pleasant anticipation for friends showing up, anger at enemies showing up, etc. That signalling happens whether a situation is happening or if we just imagine it happening.<p>Along the way in our normal lives we accidentally learn a lot of these {situation -> feeling} links which are unhelpful or tied to really dumb / irrelevant things, and they guide our behaviour too.<p>Things like: once upon a time if we were shunned by the group we would starve to death, so being shunned by people generally is a bad thing. We might bring a drawing to show and tell and the teacher makes a comment and the class laughs. Some people might get a dislike of show and tell, or being watched, others a dislike of drawing, others a dislike of feeling proud of their work, others a dislike of being good at something. (Or you might be fine with it).<p>Now having a dislike of show and tell probably wont affect your life much, but if you get: doing work that you feel proud of makes you feel bad (because your brain is predicting people will shun you), you're going to have lingering problems for a long time.<p>And the worst bit is, we have two problems on top of this. Westerners/western males shun emotions as being childish or girly, and humans have self conciousness which isn't always privy to the causes of our feelings and makes up ""logical"" explanations like ""I don't want to be proud of my work because pride is a sin"".<p>This is one big difference between people who say ""I don't see what all the fuss is about, starting a club is easy - ask people - just do it"" and people who can't ""just do it"" because the very idea of asking people makes them <i>feel bad</i>.<p>This sets the stage for the next bit: a kind of meditative/imagination skill to learn to get from ""I don't want to be proud in my work because it's a sin"" back down to ""if I feel pride in my work people will shun me"".<p>After that, he teaches various techniques to break that kind of learned link, or delve into it further or whatever. I don't want to go into that because I don't yet know them well, there isn't space to do justice and text isn't great for it, I don't feel right to give away his source of income from teaching it.<p>But I do want to direct you to this:<p><a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/21r/pain_and_gain_motivation/1uz6?context=1#1uz6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/21r/pain_and_gain_motivation/1uz6?co...</a><p>Read it as it turns into a discussion between PJ Eby and ChronoDAS, and follow the link to carry on the thread.<p>Also <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/21r/pain_and_gain_motivation/1v0a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/21r/pain_and_gain_motivation/1v0a</a><p>And where I say it isn't difficult because of effort, it's a simple act but difficult because it's mind twisting, note this: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/21b/ugh_fields/1vyj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/21b/ugh_fields/1vyj</a><p>Anyway, that's the kind of thing I was working from when parroting the parent post back. Seen in this light, reading ""recently I've just found out using tables to layout pages is a bad thing"" takes on a different meaning. Yes it's a bad thing, but that <i>doesn't mean you need to feel bad</i>. and taken in the context of the rest of his post it smacks of<p>""using tables is bad therefore I'm a bad programmer therefore I'm not worthy of a real programming job and people I look up to won't respect me now I feel shit :(""<p>whereas someone else might get<p>""using tables is bad, but I'm proud of my site anyway because it helps people swap textbooks. Any real programmer would respect my ability to compromise"".<p>Realising that <i>you could feel that way</i> is hard. It's hard because we think with our brains, and we've just found a bug in our brains, so our thinking isn't trustworthy on that matter, and we get: ""I couldn't feel good about using tables. I could pretend to feel good but deep down I know tables are bad so I would have to feel bad at some level"".<p>If you spent your life believing 1>2 then someone told you it was wrong, and convinced you, you'd get to a stage where you thought ""ok, I could believe that 1<2 .. but then I'd be wrong because 1>2. So all I can do is lie and pretend but I wont really believe it because I <i>know</i> 1>2"".<p>From the outside you can see that if you did change to ""1<2"", you would believe it and it would be real and not a lie or a pretense.<p>Anyway, PJ Eby spent a couple of years trying to summarize his work into a book and couldn't because of this very problem - you think in a particular way and if you aren't getting the right information from one piece of writing then you wont get it right and you <i>wont know how or why</i>, it might take interactive guidance.<p>You might be able to get his half-finished book by signing up to the email list at <a href=""http://dirtsimple.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dirtsimple.org/</a><p>Anyway anyway, what's great about this approach is that his methods are based on methods which work repeatably, and tests you can do that you can prove to yourself that it's working. If you do one of the methods, then imagine the situation again and still feel bad in the same way then it hasn't worked. In that sense it's basically scientific - there's no chanting over crystals of copper sulphite to transmute lead into gold, only methods which repeatably and testably get useful results. Which is why I draw a distinction between this approach and the ra-ra useless fluff and the approaches which work sometimes on some people even if they do include some woo.<p>PS: I feel a bit of a jerk writing this post. It's long, waffly, preachy, proselytizing, I fear the more respectable HN community disliking me for it (I would have emailed you directly if you had a profile address), and you rolling your eyes at me for it. These are all bugs in my thinking holding me back from doing things that I want to fix at some point. Also, sorry for talking about you as if you weren't here, Meric.",1276995712
