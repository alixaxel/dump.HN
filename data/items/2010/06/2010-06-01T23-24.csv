It's also pretty easy to find green technology and resource scarcity investors. This hardly covers the entrepreneurial spectrum, however.<p>How do you find the angels and other VC who don't specialize in these niches? Specifically I'm looking for media angels specifically, but the question is applicable across many other industries as well. In my particular case, it's a product that an organization buys, as opposed to content monetized indirectly.<p>How might I go about finding such an angel? It'd be a very small investment ($50K max), which limits my options further as most angels are looking for $100K min, FWIS.",1275436712

They have customers globally, but are hamstrung by the fact that there aren't enough people available to support their product. Similarly, going ""to the source"" for training is extremely expensive (think six figures to get around a dozen people completely trained).<p>I think there's an opportunity to provide this training through online video courses to the existing customers of this product. Regardless of customizations they do, their staff will need to know how to use the product and potentially how to extend its functionality.<p>I am considering offering this as some form of subscription - either monthly, annually, or something in between. The customer is be able to give their staff streaming access to the videos from wherever (S3 hosted or something), and there can be an additional testing component to be sure that competency has been gained.<p>To me, the ""obvious"" comparisons are to both FTE trainer costs and to sending people to the developer for training.<p>I believe I can get access to the existing customer list for North America at least, probably globally (both directly and through selective use of Google), so reaching the right people isn't a big hurdle, it's the pricing and convincing.

Many of us have no idea how important (and awesome!) our seafood industry is.  Our best shrimp, crabs, and oysters all <i>directly</i> come from the area that this spill is impacting.  All I can say is, this sucks.<p>With <i>that</i> said, reading the article leads me to believe that a good majority of reporters and people being turned away have been done so in good faith or simple mistakes.  Let's not be mistaken - reporters can crowd an area and cause serious safety concerns for people who are working to contain the spill.  And they can also irritate the crap out of workers who are more concerned with getting stuff done than answering lots of questions.  Reporters will climb over themselves to get the latest scoop on a hop topic.  And this is one.<p>On on the subject of TFR's (Temporary Flight Restrictions) as mentioned in the article - Only the FAA issues TFR's, and those are issued to protect operating aircraft in a specially designated zone from outside interference (read: mostly the media).  There was a complete TFR issued for most of south east Louisiana just after Katrina so that air traffic was carefully controlled for rescue operations.  This is no different, there is an enormous amount of aircraft that are working in this area and TFR's are common to protect the working aircraft from non-essential related aircraft.<p>I'm sure that BP has their corporate spin-doctors running at full steam, but I'm quite positive that there is no conspiracy to shut down access to the public regarding this tragedy.",1275436337

I just worked in other areas for a couple of years - construction and cooking, to be specific.<p>The physicality was a nice change from sitting in a chair, and the work brought benefits of its own: improved skill at problem-solving and efficiency (the former more in construction, the latter more in cooking, but with elements present in both), improved people skills, a better work ethic and appreciation of safety (and by extension, responsibility to your colleagues) and better work-life balance - preparing or cleaning & putting away the tools of one's trade every day became a useful ritual that helped to define the border between personal and work time, something that might be difficult when you can do system administration via your phone.<p>Of course I made much less money, not least because I lacked commercial experience or special training. But I learned a great deal in the process, and of course the task-specific skills can save one a good deal of money - for many home-improvement jobs I don't <i>need</i> to hire a contractor, and even if I do want or need to, it's a lot easier to estimate the scope and likely cost of the work. To this end, I'd say choose a job that requires skills and will challenge you, even though you might find it more difficult to get your foot in the door (especially in a poor economy, where employers don't want to hire over-qualified people who may flee at the first opportunity). So while being a waiter might be challenging and might improve your ability to handle customers, you won't accumulate a whole lot of useful skills in most waiting jobs. But many other areas allow you to develop meta-skills that will be useful in any job as described above, and if you like the industry you might well see market opportunities for computers, should you decide to return to hacking at a later date.<p>Also, when you do you may well earn more money as long as your computer skills haven't atrophied. Many employers value diversity of experience if it brings a deeper perspective and if it was undertaken from self-development rather than out of necessity. I found I enjoyed other sorts of work besides the computer-based kind, and when I was recruited a couple of years later to a computer business again, I had to think hard about accepting. Unexpectedly, my would-be employer interpreted my hesitancy as a negotiating strategy and upped his offer by about 10% on the spot. Also, I didn't go back to the same old grind I had felt tired of before, but in a direction that employed some of my newly-acquired skills (more customer-facing and process-oriented) and continued to look for new areas of development - in my case that was learning about multimedia hardware which eventually took me into the entertainment field.",1275435665

I'd double check that this is actually true and start working on building up a social network in a different metropolitan area if this were the case.<p>2) Immigration reasons.<p>Anything else? Options are never a certain ""win"" (think about lack of an exit, reverse splits, stock taking a dive). Worried about what your resume will look like? Worry less about your resume, worry more about yourself. Worried about loss of income? Don't just <i>quit</i> the job, search passively. ""Counted on"" to ship a product?

However, before you make the switch, very carefully think what is that you will be looking for in your next position and how to verify that it provides that.<p>People claim that you should ""work to live"" not ""live to work"".

SQL is a great language and SQLite is a great implementation.  But Mozilla knows what happens in the long term when we end up with a web standard that is actually defined by a single implementation: It becomes very hard for anyone else to implement the standard interoperably, or for the standard to evolve by design rather than by accident.<p>Programming languages are the most complicated standards of all.  SQL is good, but Mozilla thinks it's better to give up the advantages of embedded SQL for a lower-level API that is more standardizable, and doesn't add another language to the web stack.  (The language we have now - JavaScript - is just starting to be truly interoperable itself.)  IndexedDB can and will be backed by SQLite, and the SQL language can be built back on at the JavaScript layer where it will be portable to both SQLite- and non-SQLite backends.<p>ActiveJS already includes a SQL parser/compiler in pure JavaScript for its in-memory datastore: <a href=""http://activerecordjs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://activerecordjs.org/</a>",1275434372
