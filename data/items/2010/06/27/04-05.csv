Lame name I know but I cannot think of anything else that I could call it. I showed this to a couple of guys and they told me that they interested in giving me some money to work on the project full time. After I told them the entire details of said ""reverse auctioning"" idea they were very enthused and said that my idea was pretty ambitious blahdey blah. My question is this, since I do not need money (I do this in my off time), I have free colocation for the one server that everything is running on until I launch it and I am the only developer, should I take money to hire people? I am good at talking to people and I actually enjoy selling and talking about products. I do not want to be a one man band but I also do not want to hire someone that is not willing to work as hard as I have to get this to where it is at.<p>Can anyone else identify with this?\nI know free advice is worth as much as I paid for it but I like this board so far.",1277614642

1464929,comment,1464165,1464847,0,0,xi,,,"I wonder how Clojure deals with ambiguities when dispatching by arbitrary predicates.  Also in this case, the overhead of of generic call will grow linearly with the number of methods, right?<p>In Python, you could limit generic dispatch to argument type only without losing generality since you could override the `isinstance` operator.  For instance, you could define a `const()` type so that `isinstance(x, const(100))` is true if and only if `x == 100`.  Then your example could be written in Python as:<p><pre><code>  foo = generic()\n\n  foo.when(const(0))\n  def foo_0(x): print ""passed in zero""\n  foo.when(const(100))\n  def foo_100(x): print ""passed in 100""\n  foo.when(const(200))\n  def foo_200(x): print ""passed in 200""\n  foo.when(int)\n  def foo_default(x): print ""passed in"", x\n</code></pre>\nThis is not as elegant as in a language with native support for generic functions, but it works.  I wish mainstream languages started to adopt multi-methods; it's conceptually very simple and much more extension-friendly than traditional OOP.  Sadly it doesn't seem to happen.",1277613455

1464886,comment,1464564,1464564,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"The problem with Techcrunch's implicit interpretation of the Microsoft stats is that they mostly are trailing indicators of a business model.  Let's take Office as an example.  Does anyone seriously think that it will still enjoy network effects five years from now?  It was an exciting (at least financially) business model 15 years ago when Microsoft could basically tax the electronic exchange of business information.  Now, Office documents can be at least read, if not written, without paying the tax.  Word is hurt by the cultural shift away from using it as a means of generating pretty pieces of paper.  Better collaboration tools are slowly eroding the Excel as database-synchronized-by-email model that dominates its use (as a percentage of documents).  A large user base is nice, but it doesn't justify a high P/E ratio unless it can be leveraged in the future.<p>Look at the ""smartphone"" numbers.  The implicit message was that Apple doesn't really have all that much marketshare.  Whatever.  But, what's Microsoft have?  Close to nothing, and there's little evidence that it's going to catch up.  No one in his right mind can claim that the ""phone"" won't replace many (more) current desktop/laptop use cases in the coming years.  What slice of that goes to Microsoft?<p>I don't know much about the CRM space, so I can't comment on the Salesforce.com vs. MSFT thing.  But, what's notable is that Microsoft doesn't really enjoy network effects in that space.  It must compete like other enterprise software companies -- again, not a model to justify a high P/E.  The netbook numbers can be counted as a ""save"" against consumer-facing Linux distros, but I understand Microsoft to be practically giving away Windows 7 ""starter"" edition to keep share.  Hardly a great model.  Furthermore, the OS is little more than a platform for a web browser.  Microsoft is doing all the dirty work and making little in return.<p>What if IBM blogged about its huge mainframe market share in the Fortune 500?  Should we be excited about the future prospects of z/OS?  How many mainframe customers would gladly get rid of their mainframes if switching costs were lower?  80+%?  Look at the number of skilled COBOL programmers out there.  Surely such a large development community will continue to propel the platform forward?<p>What's causing Microsoft's stock to stagnate is that the company has failed to maintain the network effects that fueled its growth and pricing power.  They're becoming yet another company competing for consumer nickels and corporate dollars.  While that's well and good, it's not the stuff of hocky stick growth curves.<p>And, Bing?  I started using it because of 15% Bing Cash Back deals.  Forget doing an actual search or clicking an ad.",1277612157

I never tried it myself, but I don't believe they were any less ""creative"" or functional during this time, or that they were doing long-term damage.  So until better evidence comes along, I believe that maintaining schedules like Uberman is possible for the right person in the right place and time, and not trivially a bad idea.  For all I know there are good reasons for most people not to bother with it -- like some gene you need to have to succeed -- but we don't know yet.<p>As drx points out, the author strays into arguments like ""abnormal means unhealthy"".  Another bizarre argument is ""it's not optimal because you're less creative etc"".  Putting aside my own anecdotal evidence that sleep dep makes you <i>more</i> ""creative"", look -- if Uberman is actually sustainable and gives you X more waking hours per day, I'll decide for myself if that's outweighed by hypothetical cognitive deficits!
