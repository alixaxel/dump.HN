Strangely enough, a lot of the things you look back on as being ""silly"" from high-school, really aren't.  From a certain point of view.  You can only <i>truly</i> live in ""the now"" and what seems important right now, really <i>is</i> what's important right now.  Not to sound fatalistic, but we're not guaranteed anything, not even to wake up tomorrow.<p>That said, probably the biggest thing I look back on my twenties and think ""I was wrong about this"" about is this:  When I was in my twenties, I had no conception of just how short life is, and how quickly some opportunities can vanish.  So I was <i>too</i> patient.  I believed ""patience is a virtue"" (and in some ways it is) but I was probably too patient, too willing to take my time and ""wait for things to develop.""  In retrospect, there are times when being more aggressive and forcing the issue is called for.<p>Like Bon Jovi sang:<p><pre><code>  Luck, it ain't enough, you gotta make your own breaks. 
  It's my life. It's now or never. I ain't going to live 
  forever. I just want to live while I'm alive ...
</code></pre>
Sometimes you really have to say ""fuck it, I'm making this shit happen and I ain't waiting.""<p>The kicker is, there <i>are</i> still times when patience IS a virtue.  The tough part is telling the difference. So if I had any advice for  20-something, it would be to think long and hard about situations and opportunities, do some ""scenario analysis"" and really consider when it's necessary to go balls out and go for broke and be aggressive.<p>I wish I could say there's an easy way to tell the difference, but even now at 37, I still don't know for sure.

MyISAM is slow on tables with lots of writers (table level locking). InnoDB is better, but PostgreSQL is even better. Supposedly MySQL 5.4 is going to fix this. Move into big queries with lots of joins, subqueries, using multiple indexes, and PostgreSQL starts to shine even more.<p>You can even turn on async commit (since 8.3), which sends a commit acknowledgement message back to the client before the transaction is fully committed, allowing sync clients to move forward. While this does allow a very small window of time where, if the power was pulled on a machine, you'd lose just that bit of data for the tenth of a second it wasn't written to disk. All the other data is safe though, unlike MyISAM's default fsync=off, which gives it all of it's ""performance."" PostgreSQL also has async network I/O support baked into the libpq driver, which, if the client is written properly, makes this unnecessary. Note that async commit can be set per-connection and toggled on and off.<p>Virtually all of the 7.x releases were focused on durability, and 8.x releases were focused on performance, culminating with 9.0, due out soon, which will bring the much-needed readable slaves. This is the final feature that will tip the scalability gap in PostgreSQL's favor.<p>There are is a situation where MySQL shines: read-only MyISAM tables with simple queries where joins are not used. Virtually all of the write concurrency and data integrity features as well as PostgreSQL's performance using multiple indexes and joins become unimportant at this point.
