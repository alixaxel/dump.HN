A high deductible plan where you pay the first three grand a year of expenses might be a better deal at $150-$160, though.<p><a href=""https://www.kaiserpermanente.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kaiserpermanente.org/</a>   is pretty good and has online quotes;  that's where I got these quotes.<p>Now, if you have had anything wrong with you in the last three years, you simply can't buy health insurance without a job, as far as I can tell, for any amount of money.   This is the situation I'm currently in, and I'm going to end up getting a job for a few months.  The thing is, if you have a job with health insurance, you can continue that health insurance for 18 months after you leave the job (and another 18 months for a total of 3 years, if you are in California.)   you just have to pay the premiums.   Uh, last time I did that my premiums were $518/month for some /really nice/ insurance that covered everything.<p>My CORBA just ran out a few months ago.  (note, you have to do some legwork to get CAL-Cobra.. you have 60 or 90 days from when your first 18 months is up to do so.)<p>what's wrong with me?  a history of ADD and a (successfully treated) detached retina a few years back...  not exactly cancer.<p>Oh, if you really are perfectly healthy, private insurance is often cheaper than CORBA continuation of group coverage.    The problem is that if anything really expensive happens to you, a team of professionals will go over your original insurance application with a fine-toothed comb in an attempt to get you disqualified.   Group insurance, on the other hand, you get no matter how sick you were going in, and they can't disqualify you because you made a mistake on your application. (which is why it costs more)<p>My own personal plan is to get a regular job with health insurance once every three years.   At least until 2014 when the new health insurance regulations go into production.",1276564011

We wouldn't look at a watch that was running slow and say ""that watch is lazy"", and we shouldn't look at ourselves when we don't achieve what we want and treat it as some kind of failure of will.<p>Psychologists have a term for when you overestimate the actions of a person rather than the environment they're in: the fundamental attribution error. We attribute results to the ego even when it's not really responsible.<p>Your mind and body are incredible machinery that you spend most of your life figuring out how to operate. The difference between 20 and 30 is ten years of operating experience. If you've blown it this weekend, it's not because you were lazy, it's because your machinery's not quite running right.<p>The advice given elsewhere in this thread is great, but at the core is an understanding: the results mostly come from your environment. Not just the external (distractions, workspace, tools etc), but also the one in your head, defined by goals and motivations and ruled by systems and working rituals.<p>You can't change it all at once, and if you expect that the next time you sit down on the weekend you'll just have a new lease on life, you'll be disappointed. If you do this right, you'll just slowly start finding it easier. The distractions less appealing, the tasks more approachable. Eventually it will be harder to fail than to succeed. To get there, you just need to stop blaming the watch, and start listening to the machinery. What does it need to run on time?<p>PS. About founders working hundred-hour weeks without breaking a sweat, I think you'll find the number changes significantly depending on how you define work. I'm currently working 168 hours including scheduled rest breaks and group-oriented social activities.",1276563950

All schemes to have private property enforced by non state actors in a <i>modern</i> society are, at best, only plausible (but untried). A total separation of state and commercial activity is thus not possible. Furthermore some commercial activities have negative externalities; some of these are hard to measure in monetary terms; wich, in turn, makes a value judgement from the ultimate arbiter (the state) necessary; etc. This shows the difficulty of separating the state and economy even to the degree church and state are separated today. (I said degree for a reason; right to worship is also meaningless without (state) enforcement, without wich some radical muslim would surely sometimes enforce sharia laws on some unlucky apostates from their religion)",1276563883
