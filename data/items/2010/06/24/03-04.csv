That's abusive and wrong of course, but they're evidently responsible enough with them to be useful to somebody.  And in Switzerland, children routinely take part in shooting competitions at 13.<p>And of course, kids handle kitchen knives and pocket knives from a very young age.  It depends on the household, but six or eight isn't unusual; it can be as young as three in some cultures.<p>Even in this culture, early elementary school kids are taught serious things like when to dial 911 and when not to.  Learning when to use a weapon isn't that much harder.<p>If rape is a serious problem, arm the dang girls.

The average phone buyer has priorities more in line with what a curated app store provides, and that's why other companies are following Apple's lead.<p>Even if Google decides to focus on making Android appeal to a broader audience and starts following Apple's strategy, the market will still exist for open devices.  Either someone will cater to it (which I am confident Google will continue to do), or the market has become so small that no one will bother.

They're working on ways to make publisher approval better (there is an email that is sent to handle approvals; I'll ask the ad.ly guys if there's an unusual error rate).<p>Second, I know they're working on lots of tools to make it easier to choose appropriate publishers.  Everyone wants to use different metrics for how they choose, so it's a tricky problem, but the feedback is useful.  Pricing is based on several measures of influence, and they tend to correlate well with CTR from what I understand.<p>As Gabriel noted, the CPC is usually significantly better than almost any other high-quality ad network.

There's no correlation between votes of any candidate and any other candidate.  The most likely cause?  The reported vote counts are not 100% live.  The votes are processed on a server and displayed via a cache.  Most likely EID is a way to force vote counting onto a specific system, which caused a backup of cast but un-counted votes for Phyllis.  While the backup was being cleared, the rate of voting appeared distinctly high.  Once the cause of the backup was identified and resolved, the backup was quickly cleared out and the rate of votes appearing took a sharp drop as there was no backlog for that candidate and the others still had backlogs to process.",1277348845
