1397775,comment,1396644,1396890,0,0,martinp,,,"One of the things I like best about FreeBSD is the ports collection, since it allows me to keep software updated and current as opposed to pre-compiled packages (only Arch Linux comes close) in the Linux world. At the same time, the base system (kernel+world) stays stable. This is also why I would choose FreeBSD over source-based Linux distros, since the latter updates everything to bleeding edge, even the kernel.<p>Also, sometimes I get the feeling that the FreeBSD world is less about politics and more about getting stuff to work. This makes porting software easier (ZFS for example).",1275483507

1397773,comment,1397342,1397673,0,0,roel_v,,,"That would maybe work for a clueless old lady. The standard for someone with a technical background, of whom can be expected that he should know about these issues, would be higher than for someone who can make a reasonable case of not knowing about these things. At some point it becomes an ""assumed liability"" (that's probably not the proper term in common law systems) - what I mean is a liability for something not arising from doing or not doing something (like punching someone in the face - that's something you actively do), but rather from being in a certain position, like when you own a house, and a roof tile falls off on someone's head, you're still liable because it's your house (again this is technically not correct in tort-based systems but the principle holds). In the same way one could argue, in my opinion reasonably, that owning & using certain equipment (wireless routers) brings with it a certain responsibility, in this case making a reasonable effort to make sure that the equipment is not used to violate other people's rights. It will depend on the circumstances if this is acceptable.",1275483465

We did make a very conscious decision to make REAL DB2 available at no charge and not some crippled version like Microsoft and Oracle ""Express"" database offerings. Why? We wanted to create an opportunity for anyone regardless of their financial situation to be able to get the benefit of all of the DB2 features and be able to use it not just to learn but to actually use in real applications. This means that without paying IBM a cent, you can use DB2 in any and all of your projects. You can even redistribute DB2 as part of your application without paying any royalties to IBM. And, if you find yourself fortunate enough to have created a very popular piece of software that needs more resources (memory and CPU power) then all you need to do is replace the license and you now have more processing capacity. Think of it. No need to rewrite a single line of code; no need to even have access to source.\nBtw. the price to move up to more resources and full IBM 24x7 support is exactly the same as what you would pay for equivalent MySQL support option. <a href=""http://freedb2.com/2008/03/13/free-db2-is-cheaper-than-mysql-again/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freedb2.com/2008/03/13/free-db2-is-cheaper-than-mysql...</a>",1275483166

What position is more reasonable:one guy saying ""I think my rights are being violated, I have proof x y and z of that"" (logs, checksums, whatever); and then another mounting a defense saying ""yes it seems like that from the outside but I just faked all of that as a joke! Hahaha!"" Why would anyone put files with wrong names on their computers ""as a joke""? As a defendant you then have to substantiate your claims, basically because they're so outrageously far-fetched. Let's be honest, it's in the same category as a defendant in a tort suit (e.g. car accident) mounting an ""It's my evil twin brother who stole my car and then parked it on my driveway!"" defense.

1397743,comment,1397232,1397236,0,0,hga,,,"It is ... more than curious.<p>Although I don't quite remember the early '80s as this author does, e.g. a long lag in recovery was baked into the pie when the Congress required a phasing in of the Reagan tax <i>rate</i> cuts (which as I recall also didn't result in tax <i>revenue</i> cuts, since the rates at the time were way past the Laffer curve point of diminishing returns (e.g. maxes of 50% for ""earned"" income and 75% for ""unearned"" income)).  The author also forgets the massive and regressive 1982 Social Security and Medicare tax rate increases which added to the maelstrom that we exited in due course when it became ""Morning in America"" (the theme of the Reagan 1984 reelection campaign).<p>There was certainly some panic, e.g. this was the start of when reporting on the homeless depended on which party held the White House, but Washington was deadly serious about the economic and defense situation, something we just don't see today when unemployment is much larger (the official U-3 rates are not directly comparable due to Clinton changing how it was scored.  Use U-6 and/or <a href=""http://www.shadowstats.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shadowstats.com/</a>) and e.g. Iran is close to getting The Bomb.<p>The other big difference is that the '70s to early '80s economic situation was vastly different.  Back then we had a nasty case of stagflation to cure (high unemployment + high inflation, the death of the Phillips Curve).  And there was a bipartisan deregulatory consensus, e.g. it was Ted Kennedy and Jimmy Carter who deregulated trucking and civilian aviation.  For that matter as I recall Carter started the cutting of capital gains tax <i>rates</i>.<p>Today we have a deflation, and those are <i>much</i> harder to politically deal with (the irresistible temptation starting with Hoover to indefinitely delay the wringing out of speculative excesses).  The Great Depression and Japan's two Lost Decades and counting show one approach that doesn't work, why it's call ""pushing on a string"".  We're trying the same approach so there's no wonder a) it isn't working and b) politically it's ""OK"" (FDR and the Democrats kept winning elections till after WWII, Japan's LDP didn't get turned out of office until very recently).<p>It's not (yet) an existential crisis for our ruling class and the danger they're in is from too much ""government"" (e.g. ObamaCare) and too much (deficit) spending.  And as long as limited government (e.g. Calvin Coolidge following Wilson's WWI excesses) remains a dead and mostly forgotten principle there's always going to be a party of the government, so the Democrats aren't in an existential crisis.",1275482361

From a mathematical point of view, it makes no sense to buy a ticket.<p>There are a couple of caveats. When I don't have a ticket, e.g. because I forgot my wallet, I'm on a constant lookout and the train ride becomes really stressful. If you get caught several times they might press charges against you, so it is not feasible to go without ticket on a regular basis anyway. And last but not least, I'm using a service, so I pay for it.",1275481376

WAY too much Field application engineer time is spent on junior engineering problems that can't be effectively delegated due to this insufficient machine error checking.<p>I mean, half the time you generate something that will simulate differently than run in real life, that's OBVIOUS from the code structure. But no, the toolchain doesn't identify that, bench checking the specification to the VHDL is the only way to find that (or a code review by another engineer).<p>So TLDR: Make VHDL or Verilog spit out REAL errors and warnings when used somewhat incorrectly, or likely incorrectly. Bring the tools up to the standard of sequential coding tools, or even more in that direction instead of the morass it still is today for hardware specification languages.",1275481195

Many online educational projects such as Youtube EDU, iTunes U or Academic Earth have great content but lack social networking features. I believe the ""social"" part is very important in the process of learning things when you can interact with classmates and instructors, ask questions and get answers. So that not only you can browse and watch education materials, but also the community will play an important role in the learning process.<p>Do you know any websites that already offer these features?<p>There are good examples of the execution of this idea for particular areas like italki.com for english learning or www.jamplay.com for guitar playing. But I'm thinking bigger, so it'd be for fundamental university disciplines like computer science or mathematics.<p>I don't want to build another useless social network, I'm more on the way to research what is already available, how existent solutions can be enhanced.",1275480290

The result is that rather than throwing your hands up in the air saying ""it's meaningless to talk about whether something deserves to be a disease"" you can say something like:  ""In a medical context, disease means this' in a research context, disease means this, in a casual context, there are two broad groups of people for whom disease means two different things""  Armed with this more accurate language, you can start talking about actual concrete examples and explore more detailed and relevant hypothetical examples.",1275480128
