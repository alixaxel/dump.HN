1451337,comment,1451125,1451264,0,0,zalew,,,"He forgets about one thing - pro football is not managed by a single referee because it'd be impossible, he has 2 side referees to help. Also, in amateur (edit: for fun, not non-pro leagues) football you usually play without offsides or almost without them; while in pro there is a ridiculous situation where a rule meant to prevent static play (standing in front of the goal waiting for a pass) is often ripping the game of dynamic (halted actions because the side referee saw that one player's foot was 10cm pass the line of defence).<p>Football is scaled down mostly because you don't need expensive infrastructure to play and train - 2 sticks in the ground or draw lines on a fence and you're ready to kick - no equipment (baseball, hockey) besides the ball itself, no need to build anything (basketball, hockey). I think that's a far more important factor in football popularity than the rules set.",1277197101

You're more likely to win a beneficial free kick from it than two yellow cards in a row, so the practice continues.<p>Some national football associations (e.g. Italy) start training kids to do this at a young age.<p>It would probably stop overnight if a player seen taking a dive were to directly receive a red card, or a three game ban.",1277196962

It's difficult to explain. But I will try.<p>Love-Marriage (Name for the ""not arraged by families"" marriage) is still a No-No in india. Which means your parents finds a girl/guy for you. Also,you are supposed to find a bride/bride groom from the same relegion-caste you are from.<p>So, if everyone expects dowry in your relegion/caste,you end up with no other option but to pay the money to get your girl married.<p>Now the amount of Dowry varies according to the bride grooms family status & of course the qualification and job of the bride groom. If the bride groom has moved outside india, specially to US or UK, the dowry paied increases considerably, as it's considered a socially prestegious thing and he is considered a winner in Life.<p>Hence the Guy in question asking to be sent to US.

1451330,comment,1451125,1451125,0,0,pierrefar,,,"Three counter-points:<p>1. FIFA makes a ton of money from the World Cup. The sponsorship and protection efforts of the sponsorship are ridiculously elaborate.<p>2. Even FIFA doesn't scale the game linearly. In the World Cup there are always 3 refs on the field, even though really only 1 is needed. Further, there are many different types of football balls (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_%28ball%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_%28ball%29</a> ), so again, the game played on the streets or school leagues is not necessarily exactly the same as the World Cup.<p>3. FIFA constantly innovates in the making of the actual ball. Every WC we get a new ball that has different characteristics. This year's ball is the most consistent in distance and trajectory in tests (i.e. hit it the same way and you'll get the same volley).<p>With all that said, I don't think ""maintaining consistency"" is the reason FIFA refuses to introduce replay refs. I think it's more about politics: they have always supported the number 1 ref as the final arbiter of play and introducing a replay ref would undermine this long-held traditional philosophy.",1277196851

1451328,comment,1451125,1451125,0,0,Maro,,,"I am familiar with the FIFA's reasoning, and I just don't think it holds up. The best example is the NBA: advanced technical rules at NBA games aren't stopping anyone from playing basketball on the courts or at the High School level.<p>Also, the rules are different anyways. At the FIFA level, games are played on large fields for 2x45 minutes, there are 4 refs, etc. AFAIR HS level games were 2x30 minutes and we were lucky to have 1 ref, and so on. So the rules are already different at different levels, and people can deal with it.<p>Would it really kill soccer if we had video replay? Match outcomes are <i>routinely</i> altered by erroneous ref. decisions, decisions which the whole world except the ref. knows are erroneous because we see the 1000FPS close up 30 seconds later. It's become so nonsensical that at the recent Brazil game, the brazilian players after a bad ref. decision to send off Kaka with a red card were begging the ref. to look up on the stadion screen to see the replay which clearly showed nothing happened, but he couldn't be bothered.<p>I think everybody would be able to accept that at High School level games there's no video replay, and the ref. makes mistakes, while rejoicing that World Cup level games are not influenced by bad decisions avoidable just by having a 5th ref. look at the replays.<p>This would also move the game towards actual fair play in the sense that players wouldn't be constantly diving, lying about who touched the ball last, lying about what happened, <i>lying to convince the ref</i>.",1277196789

There are lots of jobs, particularly on this side of the country (um, the west) where your performance is judged by your work and not the time on the clock (if you're even clocked!).""<p>I've found that most places expect at least an eight-hour day out of you, whether you're formally ""clocked"" or not. I think often that a salaried position is seen as an opportunity for exploitation by bosses. My last job was like that, and my co-workers just ate it up; the bosses demanded ten-hour days and other concessions and everyone just went along because since we were salaried it meant we had to do whatever they said (we were even taken to the boss's house one day to help move furniture) without any prospect of fair compensation, or something like that. I don't really get it.<p>There may be a bit more leniency with breaks and that kind of thing at a salary job, but if you're not there before 9 and you're not still there after 5, and this happens even rarely without prior approval, your bosses aren't going to be pleased.<p>I agree that a job <i>can</i> provide a way for an employee to work on ""his dream"", but such a situation is incredibly rare, and even rarer is the situation where, when this dream is realized through your work, you'll get due credit and compensation.<p>Working for the man is just an all-around bad deal if you're looking to control your own life or do something big. That's just my opinion. If you're OK with a work-a-day routine, OK with even the possibility of eventual bullying from the bosses, OK with getting paid 1/4 or less of the value you actually generate, then working for someone else permanently may not be so bad, but that's not how I am, and I presume that many of us on HN have similar aversions.<p>I say permanently because I think working for other people can be a good experience, and it's nice to get a significant amount of it under your belt; it helps you understand human dynamics and politics, can accelerate your skills and force you to learn new things, introduce you to cool people, etc., so a job isn't all bad, but I have a very hard time with the idea that I would be stuck working for someone else for the next fifty years.",1277196750

1451317,comment,1451125,1451261,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Not really. This concept of ""scalability"", while alluring at first glance, falls flat on multiple counts.<p>First and foremost, it verges on a straw man; Felten argues against unspecified ""Americans"" with largely-unspecified views, when in fact criticism has been quite specific and has come from practically every part of the globe. The things people are asking to have ""fixed"" are not the lack of an official clock or any of his other examples; the things people are asking to have fixed seem mostly to be abysmally inconsistent officiating standards. Which, in an article praising the uniformity of the game at nearly all levels, is a glaring oversight.<p>Second, Felten's concept of ""scalability"" is deeply flawed; we might as well argue for the World Cup final to be played on a parking lot with piled-up sticks for goals -- after all, your neighborhood game doesn't have those big fancy stadiums, does it? Privileging some aspects of the game by allowing them to be radically different at higher levels of play, while arbitrarily requiring other aspects to be uniform at all levels, is frankly irrational.<p>Worst of all, he touches on baseball as a game which ""scales"", but fails to note that while the basic rules of the game are the same at practically every level, the implementation varies considerably <i>and the game is better for that</i>. For example, a local sandlot game doesn't need six professional umpires, instant replay and a strike-zone-tracking pitch-plotting camera system, but a major-league championship game does. This allows each game to have the level of officiating it actually needs, rather than forcing impossible burdens on the local game or false austerity on the professional game.",1277196209

Without looking it up, the top American spectator sports are American football, baseball, basketball, NASCAR racing, hockey, golf, and tennis.<p>The problem is that the best American athletes look to one of top three American sports - if you look at top NBA and NFL players, many of them seem well-suited to futbol, but it's not where the money/popularity/culture is at in the USA yet. As long as the fast and strong American athletes are looking to become running backs, wide receivers, and point guards instead of midfielders and strikers, the game won't reach the height of popularity.

Being a top 5 American sport by 2030 wouldn't surprise me.<p>After that, it'd really only take one charismatic, transcendental American player for the sport to really break through - if there was an American Pele, Maradona, George Best type player, it'd go a long ways, just like Tiger Woods did for golf, Joe Namath did for American football, Michael Jordan did for basketball, etc, etc. So I could see the game trending up in the rankings, and then it's all about if it gets the one dominant, charismatic force that people fall in love with who kids want to follow in the player's footsteps.",1277195113

That's a reasonable position to take, if you don't have to effect a charge.",1277194654

I decided to start from scratch and create something new that sums up those two fairly succinctly.<p>This is only my first attempt after looking at some similar ""un-resumés"" created by colleagues and friends. I'd like to get HN's feedback on it. It's here (warning, PDF):<p>http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/benglert/concept1.pdf<p>I have a couple of questions:<p>a) Do you feel like you got the same amount of information (if not more) out of this document that you would have gotten from reading a traditional resumé containing ""EXPERIENCE"" and ""OBJECTIVES"" and so on?<p>b) Does my dream job even exist?<p>c) Am I at a point where I get to ask for it?<p>d) Does my description of my abilities/interests/experience strike you as honest and sincere?<p>Don't be afraid to be brutal, HN.
