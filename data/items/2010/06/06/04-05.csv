You've successfully demonstrated using a search engine for finding archived posts without demonstrating that those posts reached the front page. Well done.<p>It's obvious that Adobe is a sorry pitiful place that produces slipshod software that blights the Internet and our computers with its presence -- from the 150 slider widgets in Photoshop to Flash. This has been true for a decade or more. You'll get no argument from me.<p>However, Apple also has a lot to answer for. Just because its principle computing platform isn't terribly popular, so it's less likely to be a target, doesn't make it more secure (""we're secure because nobody uses us!"" is not a terribly good selling point). The sec community has long standing grievances with the slow pace of security patches Apple puts out. Jobs has likewise generally remained silent on this matter.<p>You may continue feeling slighted by even the slightest of finger-pointing at Apple even if it's not intended as Apple bashing. A strong and vibrant Apple, as a viable competitor, is good for several industries. Hanging off of every word Steve Jobs says as perfect and without flaw is not.<p>Enjoy the rest of the weekend.",1275800377

Particularly if you look at the early days of Windows, it was unbelievably primitive compared to Macs of the same era.  And yet, because of the number of manufacturers and models of DOS/Windows PC's and the number of sales channels those PC's where sold through, the sales volume for PC's has always dwarfed the sales volume for Macs.<p>If you look at the Motley Fool's analysis, it's clear that Android will have the same advantages of diversity of models, distribution, etc. over iPhone that PC's have traditionally had over Macs.  However, IMHO the situation is even worse for Apple this time, as the quality and usability of the end user experience between iPhone and Android much closer than it was between Mac's and DOS/Windows PC's.",1275797374

I remember when 100 minutes was insanely expensive and now my only phone is a cell phone with enough minutes that I never think about it when I'm talking to someone.<p>Carriers could compete on talk minute price, but they know that few people care.  Those that do have already moved to something like Boost Mobile or one of the other low cost providers (most are owned by the big boys, so you could say they are already competing with lower prices just with a different brand).<p>SMS messaging while a ripoff from a production cost standpoint is not all that bad from the consumer view.  For $10-$15/month someone can do unlimited SMS.  From a cost to communicate with anyone and everyone as often as someone likes standpoint that is a very cheap price.  Also, people don't really care enough to move providers in order to save $5 when they would rather have either coverage, service or a certain phone.<p>Are the carrier prices really artificially high?  I will say they have <i>some</i> wiggle room, but they are walking a fine line of price they need to charge in order to build out the network across the entire US with the lastest tech and still somehow turn a little profit at the end of the day.<p>Net Profit Margin for the 1Q of this year:\nVZ - 8.49%\nT  - 8.36%\nS  - (10.7%)<p>Not exactly price gouging numbers above.",1275797217

I know some great designers but they are mostly busy and/or already involved pretty tightly in some startups. I've tried to minimize this as a bottleneck by trying to work on projects that can be effective with simple designs that I can do myself, at least enough to get launched and start iterating and testing market, etc. Great UI & graphic design seems like something you can add later in a makeover, only when and if you nail the other elements needed and it looks like it has legs.<p>also, the BDNT Meetup is a great way to hook into the startup scene.",1275797159
