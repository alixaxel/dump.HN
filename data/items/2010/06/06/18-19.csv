My ego has very little to do with this, if you think calling me a scumbag is what the problem is.  I get called worse every day, it doesn't bother me.  What irritates me is those preaching about how bad something is without ever being able to offer a better solution other than one that would suit them.  They all simply want more for themselves, it's not this perceived injustice that you couldn't get the domain you wanted is a bigger issue.  It's not.  It's simply your greed.<p>Of course you will want to turn that around and say it's me being greedy.  I've paid large sums for domain names and guess what... I know how to earn more money from it.

1408897,comment,1407464,1407948,0,0,nlawalker,,,"Spot on about reuse - I think it's really the core of a lot of problems people have. Models get complicated because people naturally want to design them for reuse, when in almost every case it's just not feasible. You can't point to something like .NET and say ""look at that level of reuse, our LOB applications should shoot for that,"" because entities in .NET represent things used by <i>all computer programs</i>, regardless of what they do. They model the machine and the network at a level of abstraction appropriate for the vast majority of computer programs out there - not all, but most.<p>Trying to achieve reuse like that - hell, trying to achieve <i>any</i> reuse in a collection of LOB apps - is incredibly tough, and in most cases not worth it. What's an ""employee?"" Height/weight/age? ID number? Location? Skillset? LOB apps are just like people: they have different ideas of what are and what are not defining characteristics of an employee.<p>Software development needs to focus on reuse of ideas, patterns and knowledge (both domain knowledge and computer knowledge), not code. The key to object modeling is making things loosely coupled and encapsulated enough that you can easily modify and add behavior later on, when you realize you actually need it, not throwing everything including the kitchen sink into your model. Even then, you can never be sure that your app or domain isn't going to take a hard left turn at some point and you need to do some major refactoring/remodeling.",1275850124

1408891,comment,1408432,1408753,0,0,rianjs,,,"Yeah, those people DOA are cheaper than surviving, if you ignore what kind of wealth a person is likely to create by being alive. AFAIK, the latest numbers on acute MI survival are ~30%, and getting better in recent years due to the widespread adoption of the CHAMP protocol. Rates go up if things happen in a certain sequence of events, within certain prescribed timeframes. Medicare is beginning to compensate at a higher rate based on how well hospitals perform in cases like heart attacks. (And other common procedures/infection rates.) I'm not familiar with the specifics.<p>I don't disagree on running the numbers on primary care, but any savings is likely to be trivial next to other areas of improvement. ""Fixing"" medmal is likely to be bigger than changing primary care, and the latest numbers on that (Amitabh Chandra, 2008, IIRC) are $50bn/yr. Medmal rates don't keep pace with the rest of health care inflation, so this is basically a one-time discount, and in terms of overall health spending, $50bn is only like 2%. In addition, even in states which have instituted some kind of tort reform, it hasn't changed how medicine is practiced, which is the ultimate cost driver. (Refs available, I'm just not at my primary computer.)<p>It was very depressing to watch ""health care reform"" become ""health insurance reform"" sometime between late 2008 and summer 2009. The two aren't the same, and insurance reform won't due anything in the long run because demand for health care services is relatively inelastic, as you had mentioned, and I had alluded to before.

I know a while back I got some interest in someone buying out prgmr.com.  Well, I listened to them, and they wanted to offer me a years revenue.  I refused, of course, and  broke off negotiations, but then I did some research, and come to find out, in my industry, that's a pretty average price.<p>Why would anyone sell a company that's doubling every 6 months for a year's take?  it seems quite irrational to me.  But, like I said, it's normal for this industry.  Now, knowing what I know now, my answer wouldn't change, I mean, the other party (and the market) obviously placed a dramatically lower value on my company than I did, but if I knew this was fair market value, I'd have said no to their initial feeler before hearing their offer.   Of course, I'll sell, for a price... but my price is so far above the 'fair market value' of the company that for all practical purposes, you can think of me as being completely unwilling to sell.<p>I mean, like everyone, I have my price, but I really, really like my company;  my price is a /whole lot/ higher than one year's take.<p>so, uh, yeah;  I think a lot of times breaking off negotiations upon hearing an 'offensive' offer is the result not of a wounded pride but of a clear misunderstanding of the market value of the good at hand by one or both parties.<p>If I'm willing to sleep with you for a million bucks and no less, if you offer me $100, it's probably not worth my time to try to talk you up.
