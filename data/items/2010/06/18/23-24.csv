I spend all day looking at a lit screen and can hardly stand the idea of settling down to read a book on way in my leisure time. E-ink isn't as good as real paper, but it is far better than a computer screen in my opinion. I wish I knew someone who reads a similar amount as I do and touts the pleasures of iPad reading, so that we could discuss it, but I don't know any such person.",1276905541
1443830,comment,1443032,1443574,0,0,ekiru,,,"There are two ways you can interpret ""users"" when it comes to SaaS applications: Either the ""user"" is the person running the SaaS server, or the ""user"" is the person actually using a client to connect to and use the SaaS application. If the latter, then the AGPL is unquestionably a good thing for user-freedom. If the former, then it still doesn't actually limit the freedom of ""users"" to ""run the program, for any purpose""(or any of the 4 freedoms). It simply requires making one's source available.<p>It's a simple extension of the spirit of the GPL and of free software to software that is ran on the servers of someone else on behalf of the actual users of the software. The GPL has always sacrificed the freedom of creators of derivative works to distribute their derivative works under different licenses in order to protect users. The AGPL is a natural extension of this to software that isn't normally technically ""distributed"" to its users. The GPL fails to protect users when the code in question is used to create SaaS applications. The AGPL fixes this weakness in the GPL. It's not ""RMS really compromising his principles""; it's the FSF really fixing a bug in their implementation of their principles.",1276905527

Otherwise you'd have to redo the exchange each time you made a request.<p>My guess is that the level of caching you'd want TLS/SSL to do is dependent on what kind of content you're serving, the usage patterns of visitors, etc. As an example, Facebook has relatively long user sessions, and would benefit greatly from caching and just refreshing the session keys. Something like Google search, where a user session may only last a few seconds and a couple requests... maybe not so useful.

1443812,comment,1443036,1443627,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"The real problem with desktop Linux is that people don't care. They use Windows because they have to. They use Windows because everything works with it and everything comes with it preinstalled. Everything works with Windows because people make sure that their things work on Windows because that's what everyone uses.<p>I don't think anyone interested in ""hackability"" feels like it's analogous to having ""drain cleaner poured on your face"". There may be ways to make cool scripting more accessible, but there's nothing particularly contrived about it IMO.<p>The bottom line is that people don't care that much about computers. If Windows lets them do everything they want to do, then there's no problem. And all most people want to do is use Facebook, Excel, the proprietary program needed for their profession, and email. All of these work fine on Windows and everyone knows how to get to them from the Windows interface. They know the ins and outs of Excel and for most Excel jockeys, OO Calc isn't going to cut it, because they have to relearn some shortcuts, button locations, etc. to use Calc, but they already know how to use Excel and can hit the ground running, so they prefer Excel. Same with almost all other software.<p>So the real reason the Linux desktop isn't going anywhere is because nobody cares. If you want Linux desktops to proliferate, you have to give people a reason to care; something new and specific that a normal person would think is cool and buy-worthy. For most people, technical arguments like ""The TCP/IP stack is great!"", ""iptables is great!"", or whatever, they don't care about that.",1276904913

Being a valued member of the community is one type of carrot that encourages quality contributions; having high visibility for your comments is a different carrot that encourages fast and aggressive posting.  Being embarrassed by having your real name associated with stupidity is one stick; having your comments removed and therefore not influencing people is another.  The article touched on this (<i>""a more basic question needs to be answered first: Who are these people who spend so much of their days posting anonymous comments, and what is motivating them?""</i>), but didn't really follow through by identifying appropriate carrots and sticks to encourage good comments.",1276902616

My lease ended in Miami and I didn't want to commit another 12 months to somewhere.  There's certainly a need for shorter term housing that isn't an overpriced overabundant extended stay.

Consider this demonstration from the late ’90s by Carnegie Mellon University computer science professor Latanya Sweeney. She took three commonly available data points: sex (male), ZIP code (02138), and date of birth (July 31, 1945). Those seemingly anonymous attributes could have described lots of people, right? Actually, no. She proved they could belong to just one person: former governor William Weld. She tells me that 87 percent of Americans can now be identified with just these three data points.""",1276902186

There are already 13 forks, and the author has been very quick to respond to issues posted there. (Full disclosure - one of the forks is mine. I can't contribute to the jQuery part, but I tried to help out with the installer script when the author mentioned it was a bit wonky.) Releasing a book in this way allows people to add value (if they can), and it's great to see an innovative use of GitHub.
