As this post says, you only need a browser for most of these tasks and if you can get everything but the ""web"" page cheap and in bulk then that's a game changer.

Not a sure-fire solution, of course - it's such a pain chasing after jailbreaks, and you never know if-and-when the magic update happens that'll stop jailbreaking forever.<p>Still, for those curious...<p><i>1: Android can Run Multiple Apps at the Same Time</i><p>""Backgrounder"" will give you basic multitasking.  And ""ProSwitcher"" builds on it to give you wonderful, Pre-like task switching.  Caveat - there just isn't enough memory in anything less then the 3GS to comfortably multitask.<p><i>2: Android Keeps Information Visible on Your Home Screen</i><p>It'll cost a few dollars, but I've been very happy using ""LockInfo"" to provide a useful lock screen.  It's a must-have application for me - it goes a long way to making my iPhone feel like an actual PDA rather then just a toy.<p><i>4: Android Gives You Better Notifications</i><p>Not nearly as nice as the Android's, but ""LockInfo"" does a pretty good job of managing my notifications once I told it to suppress pop-ups when my phone's locked.  Paired with ""Notifier"" to continue pestering me if I miss an important update, I'm pretty content.<p><i>8: Android Lets You Change Your Settings Faster</i><p>""SBSettings"" makes changing settings a snap - just slide my finger across the status bar at the top of the screen to access it.  Though I'm not a fan of the default appearance - do yourself a favor and install the ""Deep HUD"" theme for a cleaner interface.<p>--<p>And while I'm advocated bits and bobs to match up with the Android user experience:<p>""Simple Background"" is a nice bit of eye candy, if you want your iPhone to have the same sort of parallax scrolling wallpaper that Android enjoys.<p>""Inspell"" gives you red squiggly misspelling highlighting and intuitive spelling correction.  It's a <i>fantastic</i> addition.  Honest question - does the Android have something like this?",1275641446

And I can understand that Apple, esp. if they are targeting creative / ad people, are probably aiming for a completely professional look (v. Flash, etc.). Until the other browsers catch up, I suppose they have every justification for doing what they're doing. One could argue, that they don't want browsers that aren't fully conforming which might give a bad impression of the viability of this post-Flash world.<p>On the other hand, browser sniffing, as you mention, is a slippery slope. Maybe all they might do is acknowledge that until other browsers have fully implemented 3D CSS, etc., they are only recommending Safari.<p>ETA: Never mind, I went back and read the page:<p><i>Not all browsers offer this support. But soon other modern browsers will take advantage of these same web standards — and the amazing things they enable web designers to do.</i><p>Good enough I suppose...",1275638763
