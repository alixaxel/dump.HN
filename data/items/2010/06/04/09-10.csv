""Bad"" SEO is snake oil, it's cheating, it's gaming the system for commercial purposes. It's a race to the bottom to see who can screw up their UX and the Internet in general the most to get the most clicks from Google. It's evil.<p>""Good"" SEO, though, is nothing but common sense. Search engines emphasise good structure, semantics, accessibility and practises, and this is what ""good"" SEO takes advantage of. But good developers know if you're doing your job in the first place, there's no need for ""good"" SEO. That's why we don't like SEO; it's a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. If you can somehow stealthily introduce good practises in the guise of SEO, then I guess that's good, but we cringe at the thought of having to label it like that to get acceptance.",1275645176

(In fact the article concludes that the entire agency is not necessary)<p>Most -- not all, but most -- agency-watchers view the congressional hack-job in the 1970s to be the reason for many problems later on. The CIA had done a lot of bad things.

I can note from an organizational standpoint that either killing it or continuing to let it run HUMINT programs is rational, stripping it of all its power and then blaming it later for failures due to what you did to it?
