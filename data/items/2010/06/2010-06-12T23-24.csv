1426727,comment,1426211,1426500,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is a big problem for functional languages, and there've been a bunch of efforts to solve it.  For example, Clojure's default dictionary type uses a hash array-mapped trie, with each level sized so that a typical block can fit in a single cache line.  It's very common for the youngest generation in a generational garbage collector to be sized to fit entirely into L2 cache, so that you know that every write or read of a recently-allocated value will at least be an L2 cache hit.  (Unfortunately, it's usually not practical to make it a L1 hit, lest you be stuck thrashing in the GC, so you're still looking at ~12 cycles.)  Deforestation optimizes out allocation entirely, instead performing the next computation immediately on values that are already in registers.  Many GCs will also try to copy nearby pointers next to their parents, so that the pointers aren't quite random.",1276387053

When we learn multiplication at school, it doesn't have any factors so we tend to skip it, and for the same reason it's rare to encounter it in various problems. This happens also to '7', but '7' is small enough to occur in many occasions such as counting a number of items etc.  So, maybe we are more inclined to pick '17' as 'random' because we rarely meet it.

It's possible to make an argument without calling the other guy stupid.<p>What you're seeing here is really just the usual battle between ideology and reason that seems to pop up on HN on the weekends.  We've got a fundamentally silly article that wants to take all of computer science to task, based on a corner-case analysis of worst-case performance of a single algorithm, in a single, exaggerated context.<p>You're right that the author wants to rely entirely upon the OS cache replacement policy for Varnish and that's fine, as far as it goes.  But this ideology leads directly to the problem observed (namely:  some rarely used things that <i>really should</i> stay in memory are evicted, because the OS has no ability to discern the semantics of memory use by the application).  Rather than acknowledging this limitation, the author has decided instead that the <i>algorithms</i> are all wrong, and that the Stoopid Computer Scientists are all a bunch of short-sighted eggheads.<p>Again, it's not a question of who's right, and who's wrong -- it's a matter of philosophy.  You can assume that the OS memory manager is the all-knowing, all-powerful Wizard of RAM, or you can give it some guidance.  In this case, locking an 8MB heap into RAM is hardly a trade-off, when you're talking about a system that is actively managing several orders of magnitude more memory on a regular basis.  Spending days of coding time optimizing a basic data structures for worst-case memory access patterns is short-sighted, when the alternative is an mlock() call.",1276385801

Since novel deleterious mutations in cardiovascular genes are rare (human mutation rate is ~10E-8 per nucleotide per generation; unpublished data) your family history contains virtually all of the information you're going to get from genetics.<p>Also, we're talking about 101 common genetic associations - not 101 genes. To put this in perspective, <i>APOB</i> itself has over 101 known deleterious variants itself. They didn't test all of these; they just tested 101 common-variant, disease-associated SNPs. So the study is actually much less interesting than it might be.<p>EDIT: Oh, not to mention that traditional risk factors include things like LDL-cholesterol, the best-established causal risk factor for MI. The genetic risk score includes many SNPs that influence LDL-C level. LDL-C is ~50% genetically determined, 50% environmental.

That shit makes capitalists giddy. And when the guys at Goldman Sachs are happy, your political elite smiles too. Would they like 800 million africans to become another china? Yes, they would. Industrialization of a nation does not make it's raw materials more expensive. Africa's cheap labour is of little use to the west (or china) (extraction of raw materials is not labour intensive, africas commercial agriculture is underdeveloped). Growth in africa would not hurt the evil imperialists.<p>Considering the catastrophe* de-colonization in africa has been the smugness of those who dismiss all ideas carrying the faintest whiff of colonialism is nauseating.<p>*Africa is the only continent on earth were falling levels of gdp per capita has been the norm in several countries. THis picture becomes bleaker if you consider the fact that the increase in gdp per capita is from resource extraction that brings little benefits to the people. De-colonization was a disaster on the scale of maos great leap forward.",1276383759
