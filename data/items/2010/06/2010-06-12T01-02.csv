1425386,comment,1423198,1423716,0,0,Dove,,,"Then one wonders what motivates the following groups of people:<p>- The happily married.  Achievement has nothing to do with sexual satisfaction in a marriage; that is either secure or it isn't.  You might as well try to win your mother's love.<p>- Women.  The sexual 'market' looks totally different from a woman's perspective.  Do you see a guy you'd like to sleep with?  Ask him.  He'll probably say yes.  If women acheive in order to get laid, they are trying too hard.<p>- Those who have taken some sort of lifetime vow of celibacy.  Clergy, monks, some missionaries.<p>I think that covers more people than it misses!<p>Ascribing mean and petty motivations to all action says more about the speaker than it does about humanity. Study closely the great men of history--those who had an abundance of motivation--and such explanations clearly fall flat.  You can practically feel the heat of intrinsic motivation, of their pride and conviction and vision.<p><a href=""http://artofmanliness.com/2010/02/26/lessons-in-manliness-from-byron-whizzer-white/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://artofmanliness.com/2010/02/26/lessons-in-manliness-fr...</a>",1276307940

1425376,comment,1425054,1425287,0,0,RevRal,,,"Thanks.<p>I basically have this figured out, didn't see your comment until after.<p>The first hint was when Fs popped up in the first digit, which would make the color pretty red, so I thought F might mean ""red"". Red <i>is</i> the last color on the color spectrum and it was the highest letter that ever appeared.<p>So my first hypotheses was that every successive digit modified the previous digit, adding an amount of a certain color. But that didn't make sense because I knew FFFFFF was white. If my hypotheses were true, then it would be red.<p>I realized right there that I'm adding at least three different colors together. How did I realize this? You add colors to make white. From there I was looking at splitting the hex color into different pieces, and if each piece is at its highest intensity then you will have white (FFFFFF). F being the ""highest"" influencer of a color. I knew the first to be red.<p>I clicked a bunch, taking note of where the Fs popped up and the color. I was thrown off by second ""digit"" Fs. After figuring out which digits didn't influence the color much, I basically had it.<p>It wasn't hard to figure out. I'd like to know how long it takes someone who doesn't know that hex is sixteen.<p>Note: This really only took me about ten minutes.",1276307147

It hasn't got a fancy touch-screen like the iPhone, but I like it better. That's why I forked out money for it.<p>The software is flawed and occasionally a little buggy.<p>There are, as far as I'm concerned, no apps. I mean, there are apps, but not enough, and not ones I care about. An when I do care about them, they are usually unusably buggy.<p>I personally would like to see how Android does on a Nokia phone. Wish I could stick it on my E72, actually. I have no prejudice against Symbian, but right now it doesn't seem to be up to par.<p>Don't forget, Nokia's market share is largely tied to basic phones. The iPhone and Android are flagship devices; they are what gets all the press coverage. Nokia's current position reminds me of Microsoft's a little while back. Apple got all the press and the hype and the hey-isn't-this-amazing, while Windows was actually more widespread and probably making more money.<p>P.S. I have heard it's kind of an awful platform to develop for. It's allegedly more difficult to program, the platform is extremely fragmented, and a general lack of interest means it's not worthwhile.<p>> Is it seen as ""unpatriotic"" because is foreign?<p>^ America doesn't really do this anymore.

I was one of those chomping at the bit waiting for it to finally be released... then it was, with a screen that is too small for the phenomenal resolution, and with a UI that is geared toward (finger input) touchscreen and a touchscreen geared toward the precision of pen input.<p>I'm one of the oddballs that loves the precision of pen input. People I meet are still amazed when they see my aged N800! They are disappointed when I tell them it's not a phone, and even more disappointed when I tell them it hasn't been made in years. Nokia was relying on word-of-mouth advertising for their Internet Tablet platform, but then they changed the platform to something it's not. When I tell these people there's a newer, much more powerful version that adds a phone - called the N900, they get excited! When I tell them that it has the same resolution, but compressed into a smaller 3.5"" screen, they are disappointed. When I tell them that it is not subsidized by any carrier, and that you have to pay full price (or if discounted, is still $550), it doesn't matter that it's ""unlocked"" (never locked in the 1st place), as: 1, the price is too high and 2, GSM limits you to only 2 carriers in the US.<p>I hope the new direction (MeeGo) helps, but I'm not holding my breath.<p>Nokia had a ""design by community"" website not long ago (still up, but now closed for selection), but they guided the input by not allowing you to submit combinations Nokia didn't like! Read the comments on the project's web page and it becomes obvious that Nokia doesn't want to know what people want, they want to tell people what they want. The really stupid part? They didn't even allow people to select combinations that matched up with some of Nokia's most popular products!
<a href=""http://conversations.nokia.com/design-by-community/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conversations.nokia.com/design-by-community/</a><p>Nokia needs to take the MeeGo project in two directions:
They need a larger screen with the resistive input (and a keyboard that can actually be used, a 5-row like the SideKick) for one, keeping the ""computer first, phone second"" mentality. The other should be a capacitive input phone with application functionality. Both could share the same repositories (app stores, if you will), with guidance within the selection based on whether the application being viewed is appropriate for the model the user is using at the time.<p>If they do this simple thing, I'll be buying the computer-first/phone-second product, as that is what I need. I'm tired of carrying the N800 <i>and</i> a phone.
If not, I'll have to settle for a nice Android, as they meet most of my needs. Sadly, the one need Android doesn't meet is the ability to run actual Linux software. Ironic, ain't it?<p>Oh, and my wife and I started with Maemo on the Nokia 770...  and as much as she loves hers, her needs are slightly different than mine. She's considering the iPhone, but I'm fairly certain she would go for the 2nd option in the above paragraph were it made.",1276306591

Swimming?<p>I have been running now for 30+ years, not _quite_ half my life. I took it up in college and liked it at once. When I am in condition, there is nothing quite like a run in the park. Am I sweaty in the summer? Always. Am I uncomfortable summer or winter? Sometimes. But I enjoy it.<p>I mention this only for the benefit of HN readers who do not run, who might be thinking of taking it up, and might suppose from the article that all of sweaty guys are suffering.",1276305464

In fact, on Snellen charts, the letters are carefully designed to reflect this.  For instance, on the 'E', the width of each bar of the 'E' is equal to the width of the white space between bars.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart#.2220.2F20.22_.28or_.226.2F6.22.29_vision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snellen_chart#.2220.2F20.22_.28...</a><p>So yeah, if you drew out a tiny ""E"" (or ""P"" or ""F"", I don't think it matters) on a 326 ppi screen a bit more than 12 inches from the viewer's eyes, where the width of each bar was 1 pixel and the space between bars was 1 pixel, then I think that would match up closely with the standard for normal vision, at least in terms of visual acuity for one eye.",1276305292

Undesirable for the developer perhaps, but nothing compared to the worry that someone's <i>general opinion</i> of your individual app could kill the whole project. The rationale is also pretty much irrelevant if the rule is already published (eg. no cross-compiled code) - you don't need to second-guess it, you just need to follow it",1276305183
