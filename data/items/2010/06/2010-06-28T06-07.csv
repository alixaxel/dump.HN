Cool, oCaml has references? Cool, Haskell has monads? That is true, those things might be a bit different, but the basic concepts of immutability, functions and recursion is all the same, no matter what happens.<p>So, tl;dr? You language is not novel, your language is not new, I have used a language which is similar to your language, I will just be bored if you throw me into Programming 101, because your language is new and I will probably just walk away.",1277707536

My parents said I had to get a summer job, so I got an entry level PR job at a Web design agency (new media, baby!) in London. Somehow, within a few weeks I was attending recruitment interviews. One totally normal looking guy came in, sat down, and after a quick introduction the CEO asked him what his background was. The guy jumped up, shouted ""you can go f!@k yourselves!!"" and ran out slamming the door. Never saw him again.<p>I was only at the agency a month in the end, but just the crazy things <i>I</i> saw there could fill a book. In hindsight, I regret quitting.",1277705252

In my experience most programmers are conflict-adverse and like taking on projects, this might be obvious but it means we often find ourselves over stretched.

If you're only interested in 2D, you could theoretically pass double-rate video marked as 3D, and get a 120Hz refresh rate.  I don't know how HDMI 1.4 signals 3D vs 2D video, though, so you may need a video card (or dongle) that can send the right signal and/or flip the right bits in the HDMI signal.",1277705159

The language has to be quite bad in order to drive programmers away from good libraries.<p>It's the Python problem: I know the shortcomings of Python quite well and I would happily use some other language instead except that Python has almost everything and despite the shortcomings of the language itself, Python is by far the fastest way to code a quick program to solve some random, particular problem.<p>I don't like Java but in the case of Clojure, the heavy machinery in JRE is a critical life-saver.
