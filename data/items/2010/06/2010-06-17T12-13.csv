I am now 27 and if things keep going like they are, I guess I'll reach the target even before I'm 30.<p>Some tips from my small experience so far.<p>(1) Don't take life to seriously. When I was in college, I started a simple business that kept very good pocket money flowing in - like your textbook business _might_. I spent every single cent that business brought in. I reckoned that after I graduated, my first couple paychecks will probably cover 3 years worth of pocket money savings. They did.<p>(2) Being a billionaire by 30 requires something extraordinary. Being a millionaire doesn't. The best way to do it is by working hard, saving money and being really good at something most companies will pay you for doing. You don't even need to be excellent - just really good, That, combined with a disciplined saving mentality will get you there quickly. It helps to live with your parents for as long as absolutely possible.<p>(3) When you start earning real money (after graduating - or maybe before if things go well) then save up a nice little bit. Invest in shares and so on, like you are doing now, but as soon as you can, buy a little house and start renting it out. Then pay it off and get another. And another. You'll hit that million mark pretty quickly that way.",1276777892

As soon as you have more than one person working on the same part of your code, you incur some degree of overhead. I don't see why the numbers 8 or 20 are special. Are you really claiming that a competent development team of 18 people cannot do more than a competent development team of 8 people?<p>To co-ordinate teams of many developers, we divide projects into manageable chunks, each with a relatively small number of developers working on them. This requires good abstraction tools, so that developers can see how their contribution fits into the larger picture, can work with the code written by others without having to know it in intimate detail, and can combine all the components into a complete product. Again, I don't see how this picture differs whether you have 8 people or 20 people, unless you're following some sort of surgical team model where you really are trying to get all of the smaller team working on the same code but most of them aren't actually writing that code at all.",1276777436
