1427090,comment,1427035,1427035,0,0,masklinn,,,"> Of course, not every game was like this. Fallout was one of two games offering this much freedom. The other was Fallout 2.<p>There was at least a third one: Arcanum. If anything, Arcanum gave the player even more choices as one of the choices of infinite graduations was the player's navigation between technology and magic, which had consequences throughout the whole game.<p>Arcanum was also the second game series I've known (after Fallout) where playing ""evil"" throughout the game was actually possible and not a dead end.",1276412178

The author of the article didn't do that work. I won't be seduced into conjecture about the ellipsis, but evidence about the future is not so much hard to find (it's everywhere in fact; it's the present state of things) as hard to interpret. Still, there are lots of smart people working on predicting one or another aspect of the future.

But do people in biotech think that software itself is helping them discover drugs? Googling for 'biotech' and 'programmer' doesn't seem to answer the question immediately. Just curious. I imagine we're nearly there, if not there completely. And that the molecules involved are fairly complex -- but I didn't know that we were that dependent on computers for biomedicine. Any examples? There was a recent article about mapping the human genome being less than a panacea. Maybe there are some good examples though....<p>(Fwiw, the reason I nitpick is that it might be the wrong way to look at it. Software helps researchers discover and produce new drugs. But it's important to distinguish that from software actually discovering new drugs. Seems like a small point -- but it's actually a very different emphasis. One can, for example, lead to an AI winter, if the focus is on producing this amazing self-sufficient software, instead of thinking about it as a tool.
