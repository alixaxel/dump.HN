This allowed me to travel and work at the same time, which I loved. Businesses were desperate for people with good web development skills, at that time.<p>Then the recession hit, and everything changed, at least for me. The remote work vanished. I can still find good paying work in New York City, but its all the kind of work where you have to go into the office everyday.<p>My guess is that the kind of work that can be done remotely has moved to countries that have very low wages. The kind of work that remains is the kind of work that can not be done remotely (or so the client feels, due to considerations of security or firewalls or the need for cross-functional team integration, or for the need of internal training of other workers who are suppose to learn skills from you).",1277827169

1471794,comment,1469363,1470991,0,0,chmike,,,"Water is said to be active when the effect on basophile cells was positive. Basophile cells are actors in the immune system and Benveniste was studying mechanism of allergy when he discovered this effect. Water remained active even with repeated dilution and shaking. When water was heated above 80°C and cooled back again it became inactive, which means it had no more effect on basophile cells.<p>Benveniste also detected the presence of a low frequency (~500Hz) EM emission of active water, which is not present with inactive water. The source of this low frequency EM emission is a problem in itself because it is not compatible with the water molecule oscillation frequency.<p>Recording the EM emission and replaying it back on inactive water rendered the water active on the basophile cells. These are the experimental evidences reported by Benveniste that remains to be explained.<p>Things fall in place when we assume the presence of stable water molecule aggregation with charge movement through them, a growth mechanism by polarization affinity and fragmentation by shaking.<p>BTW it is not true that the editor was willing to publish the ""guy's"" article. Benveniste was before it a well known and respected scientists and he had to insist and debate for his article to be published. It was published because the editor had nothing to oppose to it and justify a rejection.<p>When he came to check the experience with Randi, probably under pressure of the scientific community, they found nothing that could explain the observations which where reproduced at will in front of them in increasingly twisted ways. Randi and the editor went nearly nuts for not finding any trick or error.<p>The result is that they justify the mismatch between their beliefs and the data by undetermined experimental errors. How convenient, but that is not science.<p>Note that I am not talking about homeapathy here and claiming anything about it. I currently have no clue and no beliefs about it. What I say about it is I don't know. And this is the best that we can objectively say a priori without error about it.<p>Back to the Benveniste discovery, the normal scientific process should be to try to elaborate a theory that explains the observations; not to debunk it at any cost. Once a theory is proposed and proved to be coherent and valid with current scientific knowledge and understanding, it should then be tested. My father proposed such a theory, but it has not been tested yet. From what he told me, it should be easy. If the water molecule aggregates are present they should change the electric property of water. Simple direct measurement with conventional EM measurement devices should do it. No need of hard to control basophile cells reaction test. According to Benveniste observation, EM signal could induce formation of these aggregates and thus, according to the theory, alter the EM property of water. If the aggregates are stable, the change if EM emission of water would be persistent and measurable. it would be removed after heating the water which dissolves the aggregate structures. How hard would this be to test and explore ?",1277827050

I think you are underrepresenting the advantages of having a car.<p>If I expected to be earning and living on less than perhaps $12 an hour for an extended period of time, I would probably choose to go without a car, likely by moving someplace like Dallas TX (where I live now, and where the local wages vs. cost of living seem reasonably favorable) and renting an apartment very close to a bus line on a major suburban business artery. Judging from my high school experience, from many observations of foreigners living off their science grad school stipends, and from everything I've noticed in my years in Dallas, that'd work reasonably well. But doing without a car would constrain my life in important ways (including job options, education options, and general time efficiency) and I'd be very motivated to find economical ways to reduce the problem, e.g. sharing a car, or getting (and probably learning to maintain) an economical motorcycle.",1277826698

He doesn't code, but he always has a strong vision about the product. Yes, at first I thought that a visionary co-founder was a glorified way of saying over-zealous MBA, but Mark has the ability to see both the forest and the trees when it comes to building a product and developing software on a constrained schedule. The two of us worked extensively on the product, building and scaling it from a simple flatpage app to something that appealed to college kids around the US while handling 22 concurrent req/sec.<p>I left FratMusic for two reasons. First,  I didn't have enough time to dedicate to developing the site. Second, I was concerned with some of the legal issues that the site could be facing. Despite this, I know Mark has been working diligently to find a way to make the site work. If I had more time, I definitely would have stuck with the project.<p>Technically, the site is pretty fun. I wrote it all in Django and it comes with some interesting problems, both tech and systems. From a technical perspective, I spent a fair bit of time trying to better recommend music to users, and to A/B test purchasing avenues through iTMS and Amazon. From a systems perspective, the site has a grown a lot. Last semester, we were doubling our slice's ram just about every three weeks. We switched from Apache to nginx and are now running in a full MySQL / python / fcgi / nginx / memcached environment.

The Small Arms Survey is an extensive series of research publications from a UN-funded research group in Geneva. And according to them, the single strongest predictor of small arms violence is wealth inequality. The #2 factor is poverty, in absolute terms. My take on this is that inequality creates resentment, and poverty in absolute terms (going hungry) creates desperation. Desperation+resentment is a deadly combination. After that, social attitudes about violence play a big role (For example, Japan since WWII has developed cultural attitudes that inhibit violence, but Latin America hasn't.) Another predictive factor is males ages 15 to 30 who are ""unemployed and not in school."" Drug trafficking is also a strong correlate with small arms violence. In some parts of Mexico today (cities like Juárez that directly border the US) you can see all these factors at work: higher inequality than the US, higher poverty in absolute terms, weaker cultural attitudes inhibiting violence, and serious drug trafficking, with young unemployed male sicarios.",1277825600

This has obvious advantages if you want to use an immutable style, but is not strictly necessary.<p>Proof: It all ends up running on assembler anyhow, which isn't functional or OO or logical or any other paradigm.
