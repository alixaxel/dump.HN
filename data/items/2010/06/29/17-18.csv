I like backpacking. We were bootstrapped for 6 months before closing serious angel money and once a month I left friday night and came back sunday evening. Once a month I couldn't work on the weekend. And even though it was expensive at the time, it made me sane and filled up my gas tanks for a month.<p>Working 12-14 hour days is fine as long as you do something that makes you happy and refuels you when you need it. If 1 hour a day is what you need, it's an extremely small price to pay for peace of mind. Additionally, my bet is that you'll actually perform better at work.",1277834265

The current lifetime earning difference between someone with a bachelors and someone with no degree was close to a million dollars last time I checked, that is strong monetary motivation to get the degree.  I do not have the figures to compare for someone with a bachelors and someone with a PHD, but anecdotally it seems fairly small.<p>More than that, there are a great many non-research career tracks that are only open to someone with a degree, and a great many others that don't technically require a degree but go much more smoothly.<p>It only makes sense to pursue a PHD if you have both a passion for that field and at least enough money to handle the necessities.

I run a vacation rental site and many property owners in the VR community are not happy with AirBNB.<p>It's not because they don't want the competition.  They are all used to competing with other properties in their area.  It's because they want a level playing field.<p>Many areas require vacation rentals to be licensed and/or charge a tax on their rental fees.  These VR owners don't like competing with AirBNB room owners because the VR owners presume - rightly or wrongly - that the AirBNB room owners are not properly licensed or collecting the appropriate taxes.<p>I think AirBNB is a great idea and this proposed NY law goes way too far.  They shouldn't be legislating innovative ideas like this out of existence.  They should be finding ways to equitably welcome the AirBNB model into the existing fold.",1277833888

Toshi was working on the mezzanine level of the apartment while we were there, and there's a shower with a window out to the living room, which isn't particularly conducive to rentals...<p>It was a way better experience than using a hotel. He actually double booked the room for a couple of the days, so he gave us a different apartment in Manhattan for those days.

I'm surprised NYC landlords aren't more up in arms about this.<p>I don't agree with making it illegal outright, but I actually am kind of in favor of regulating and taxing this better, for the issues the OP talks about as well as the sublease issues.<p>Edit: After thinking about this a little more I realize the OP goes 90% of the way but doesn't quite cross the finish line with the argument.
