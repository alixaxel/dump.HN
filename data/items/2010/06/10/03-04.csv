When I boot into the BIOS my mouse cursor appears, and I can use it to go into the different menus and make changes.<p>For some reason, seeing a modern GUI in VGA mode on a 1280x720 pixel screen annoys me a million times more than a more BIOSey interface. The new BIOS gives me the same information, and I feel I can accomplish the same tasks in the same amount of time, but the pixelated check boxes, mouse pointer, and buttons piss me off. They don't add anything to the interface. They're just there, looking jagged. If it's not broke, don't fix it. Don't try to render curves on a 640x480 display.<p>Anyways. Enough ranting.

1419051,comment,1417596,1418857,0,0,rbanffy,,,"By themselves, stored procedures are not going to prevent SQLI. You will also have to lock down the database. You should also use parametrized queries to call those procedures, or else you would be able to inject something to get some information you shouldn't have access to or, at least, do something that can bring down the server (like looping around the stored procedure in a DoS attack).<p>My problem with stored procedures is that when you go that way, your business logic will end-up inside the database or, worse, scattered through layers of application and database (ever tried to do version control on stored procedures?), something really bad when you need to know what is going on with the server or when you need to move to a different database.<p>If you check your ORM thoroughly (I never did that as thoroughly as I wish I had with Django) and you never, ever, write SQL in your business logic (something you really should go for) you will be in better shape than if you write SQL code that calls stored procedures. It's easier for the DBA to slip up in a your-business-specific way than for the ORM maintainer. Also, with the DBA, only a few people will have access to catch the mistakes whereas lots of people read (and abuse) ORM code regularly.<p>I think the most important point you mentioned is not the stored procedure, but the lock down. If the app isn't allowed to mangle the data it should not mangle, you are mostly good. The best part is that locking down the database can happen without touching the ORM and is more or less portable across different databases.",1276140725

That price probably is the cost of the rocket anyways, not the mission. And no, I don't think the two craft are truly comparable because their missions are different, but I'm just arguing SpaceX's rockets won't be dramatically lower in price all things considered.<p>Second, looking at their launch manifest (<a href=""http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spacex.com/launch_manifest.php</a>) most of those flights are for the Falcon 9 with the customer being NASA (the government).  How many of those customers are purchasing the <i>low-cost</i> Falcon 1 rocket? 1 maybe 2?  8% of their manifest is low-cost flight.  The rest are for (probably) market-cost flight.  Do you have any links to suggest that the market for low-cost spaceflight is booming?<p>My point being:  Most people think SpaceX is the future of spaceflight when it looks like they are just another NASA contractor.  What's horrifying to me is how they were able to <i>win</i> the NASA COTS $1.6bn contract with absolutely no record of mission success.<p>EDIT:  Another interesting tid-bit- NASA reportedly spends about $114m per a Soyuz mission (<a href=""http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=13441.0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=13441.0</a>).

As far as I can tell BP only leased the rig to drill it new wells, I believe (although I could be wrong) that their staff weren't operating the rigs. So I really have no clue where the liability will ultimately land.",1276139119

How does your Starcraft 2 rank matter, at all, in World Of Warcraft? This is a genuine question, since I haven't played either game.<p>The only tie-in I've heard of deals with SC2 Collectors Edition.  Purchasing it gives you a rare ""Mini-Thor"" pet in World of Warcraft.",1276139057

The input text would give a clue to the innermost wheel as to what universe of random words to choose from. For instance inputing Blue might produce berries, bird, feelings, ect., vs stop sign or school bus on the inner wheel. It seems like it would be more interesting to ""play with"" when someone is bored too, which could translate into more sales.",1276138970

For starters, they probably realize that vernacular allows for you to 'google it' or 'bing it' or 'yahoo that', but not to 'microsoft that'. If anything, 'microsofting' something probably involves putting it out of business with predatory business tactics.<p>Alternatively, it could be a judgement call on MS's part based on their knowledge of the Colbert audience.",1276138836
