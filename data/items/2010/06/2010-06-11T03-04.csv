Morally lazy. Many are unwilling to employ intellectual rigor evaluating the morality of their own actions, or the actions of their industry en-masse -- inellectual rigor that they so effectively employ looking for trading opportunities.<p>The ""I'm acting in an economically rational fashion with an invisible group of trading partners losing on the backend of my trade; this is capitalism, what's your beef?"" attitude combined with willful ignorance when it comes to industry-wide ethics or morality actually does have a lot to do with what's happening in the market. The CFA Level 1 exam doesn't even have a ""Duties to society/the market"" concept in it. It's just not part of the industry.<p>Compare how hedge funds today act to JP Morgan in the early 20th century.<p>Hedge Funds: ""We have billions of other people's money, and no market responsibility whatsoever. None. That's not what we do. What we do is  arbitrage and thereby create goodness. Why do you not see the goodness we create by moving this money around in a way that makes us rich?""<p>JP Morgan: ""Oh, shit, the economy is going down. I am sitting these MoFo head bankers down in a room until we get this fixed. And, I'll do it again in a few years if it happens again. DO NOT LEAVE THE ROOM. WE ALL MUST FIX THE MARKETS.""<p>Being able to move the market just because 'someone else gave us leverage' does NOT remove one's own responsibility. Spreading out blame among industry partners for market crashes does not absolve one's own responsibility for participating in actions that might have made the crashes worse.*<p>Anyway, I encourage you to think more broadly and consider societal outcomes in your (possibly) high influence job. You mention nuance -- a more nuanced approach to your own industry's role might do you good, both career-wise and personally. As an example, your tobacco farmer analogy is specious: a poorish Virginia family weighing public health against survival is one thing, but the analogy would have us imagine these poor quant fund managers will be starving if they aren't allowed to play with their computer models and deploy billions using them -- this is the only skill they have! Society weeps. (And covets their jobs..)<p>Perhaps the best thing to do would be to imagine you'll have to answer to JPM in heaven someday for every trade; I wonder what complaints he might have for each of us. I may announce my WWJPMD bracelets on Zero Hedge soon; I'll keep you posted.<p>* I don't particularly blame hedge funds for the last few years -- that would be silly -- although it's also pretty hard to say that HFT had nothing to do with those little 'hiccups' a few weeks ago, just like it's pretty hard to say that unwinding debt leverage issues had nothing to do with the commodities death spiral in 2008.",1276228446

It does not take raw materials like copper and sand, and apply labor, capital, and innvotation to turn them into products worth more than the sum of their inputs, creating real wealth.  It doesn't mine or farm those raw materials.

Among other things, it assumes that asset returns are normally distributed random variables, it assumes that investors have homogeneous expectations about the return of an asset (aka everyone has the same info at the same time and observes the same risk and expected return of any particular asset), and it doesn't explain variance in stock returns. In other words, it doesn't accurately mirror reality.<p>Secondly, while I agree that most people shouldn't be picking stocks, my hair still bristles when I hear someone say that individual investors can't beat the market.

The foundation of just about all business is the capital markets - without them, the big dollar buyouts and IPOs don't happen.  Understanding financial markets is understanding the foundation of society, and understanding the history of financial markets is a better roadmap of 'how did we get here' than, say, studying the personalities of kings and presidents.  Sitting in front of your computer, literally everything you touch and look at is the product of the organisation of finance through capital markets.  Without it, factories don't get built, shipping doesn't happen, nothing would get done.<p>Once you understand financial markets, you realise your startup is actually two products : one is the product that people buy, the other is the company as a product, which means the company as an investment opportunity.  If you understand what capital markets want from companies, you can design that into your company to make it more saleable.<p>Also, any decent undergrad course worth attending should at least cover finance and economics, even if at 101 level.

After 6 months to a year of responsible use of the card (i.e. buy a stick of gum every 3 months, pay after you receive the statement) they will graduate it into a standard credit card and unfreeze your linked savings account.<p>You can build credit history fairly fast this way.

The fact that my income is double my living costs and I've never had an account go to collections doesn't figure in and I have less (and worse) options available for credit than someone who has been running up credit card bills or other lines of credit and missing payments, defaulting on loans, etc.<p>Then again, this is an outlier group and the actual problem with the system is that while it's massively efficient and accurate nearly all the time, we're so dependent on them that there is no mechanism to override the system when it's appropriate.",1276226802

So step one is to pick an area where you want to improve.<p>If you don't know where to start then just start anywhere - come up with one or two concrete objectives to work towards.  The most important thing is to start.  Pick something that looks achievable over 2-3 months and go for it.  By the time you have achieved those objectives you will have built up some momentum and also learnt a bit more, so you'll be in a slightly better place to pick your next objectives.  As you get better at this you can start picking bigger targets and doing it over longer time frames.<p>If you're really stuck then try picking an open source project at random and commiting yourself to contributing something to that project in the next two months.  That could be programming, it could be documentation, it could be something else.  If you're not physically active, then pick some kind of physical challenge too.  Completing a  5 kilometre/3 mile run/walk is achievable for most people in that time frame.<p>The more you do, the more you'll know what to do (and the more you'll realise how much is still undone).<p>And on a more specific level - if you want to get into a top grad school you will most like have to do well academically.

What follows is old advice, but not many people seem to follow it.  If you're studying a technical subject, then make sure your maths is up to speed.  If you are bad at maths it will make any kind of numerical/equation type of exam much harder (and also many things in the real world).  During the exam, do three passes through the paper - on the first pass just read it, look for easy questions.  On the second just answer stuff that you know reasonably well, don't waste time on difficult stuff.  On the third pass go back to the questions you couldn't do and do as much as you can.  Even if you can't answer the question write down stuff that you think is relevant, you might pick up a mark or two here and there (but don't go overboard writing down irrelevant stuff, your marker won't thank you for that).  And practice, practice, practice.  Get hold of old exam papers and do them (timed).  Get hold of the answers to the old exams if you can and study them.  Often the questions are set by the same person each year and often they aren't very imaginative at coming up with new variations.",1276225484
