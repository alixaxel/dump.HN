1445152,comment,1444949,1445110,0,0,bradleyland,,,"Core difference: the request processing model. Nginx uses the ""hot new"" event-loop model. It's a good model, but I find that most people overstate the performance difference and resource usage.<p>The bigger problem is that Apache comes configured ""out of the box"" on most distros with a whole slew of options that you probably don't need. Even having said that, most people <i>think</i> that Apache is using more resources than it is. They see all these processes floating around in `top` and they freak out. See my post in the other thread (linked in parent) for more info on that.<p>Most of the concern is driven by ignorance rather than deep understanding. I can feel the searing burn of Nginx fans' glare, so let me qualify that. YES, Nginx is a fantastic web server. YES, pound-for-pound, it is more resource efficient than Apache. The catch is, if you trim Apache down to do only what you need, the margin between it and Nginx becomes much smaller. If you really know Apache well, then you don't necessarily need to switch to Nginx, just because it's hot and new.<p>If you don't know Apache well enough to scale it, or if you're really, really tight on resources (you can't afford a 10% bump in VPS RAM), then you should probably learn Nginx straight away, because it's a fantastic web server. Hell, every Apache admin ought to learn Nginx, because you will no doubt learn something in the process.",1276973901

1445149,comment,1444212,1445115,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's easy to raise wages when times are good, but it's hard to drop wages when times are bad, because it results in the whole office getting demoralized and productivity dropping.  So companies will resort to laying people off entirely when revenues drop, because the morale hit from cutting people off entirely is less than the morale hit from dropping everyone's salary.<p>Finance presumably solves this by paying out the majority of compensation in bonuses, which are explicitly tied to the firm's performance.  If the company does well, you do well, if the company does poorly, you knew ahead of time that you'd be taking a haircut, so it doesn't feel as much like a broken promise as when wages are cut.<p>They're not <i>completely</i> immune from layoffs though - when a firm goes under entirely, most of the employee base is let go by the acquirer.  And financial firms tend to blow up completely more than other types of firms, because they operate with more leverage.  That's why luxury businesses in NYC took a big hit this financial crisis.",1276973768

1445139,comment,1444212,1445022,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is basically what every investment banker does.  Virtually every investment banker has ""their number"", the amount of money they need to quit investment banking and go do whatever it is they want to do with the rest of their life.  Very few of them ever actually meet it - or rather, they'll meet their initial ""number"" early in their 30s, but by then their number will have grown by a few million more, as they realize that sticking with the job for just another year or two will give them another half a million more or some insane amount.  It gets to be a treadmill - every time you're about to quit, there's another carrot dangled right in front of you, and it takes a lot of willpower to say ""No, I'm done"" and leave.<p>The head of BizDev at the financial software startup I used to work at was one of the lucky ones who got out (and he told me the above observation).  You occasionally see other ex-financiers in the startup world, eg. Jeff Bezos or Joshua Schacter, but in general you don't see very many ex-investment-bankers.  Most of them seem to still be working on Wall St.<p>BTW, this applies to other professions as well.  An engineer frequently will see ""just one more technical challenge that needs solving before I can get to the good, world-changing stuff.""  (I'm dealing with that now - I keep getting distracted from the ideas I really want to do by the various low-hanging fruit.)  An experienced teacher will think ""Just one more year with the kids, then I'll retire.""

They will work best when the choices are adequately represented by an icon or single word, the choices are hierarchically flat (no drilling through submenus), and when the menu is accessed so frequently that the user can quickly map those choices to muscle memory.* Outside of these conditions, they don't work so well, because their advantages in terms of Fitts' law are greatly outweighed by their lack of readability.

Well, soon after AT&T bought McCaw Cellular my friends in the cellular phone communications research area were asked to work up an explanation of why such a thing can't exist and isn't likely to exist any time soon.  It turns out that after AT&T bought McCaw they (McCaw) was very unhappy to learn that the wrist-phone was a figment of a marketing person's imagination and not something actually being developed at Bell Labs.  Ooops.  I hope they didn't let themselves get bought by AT&T just because they thought we had that product in the wings.",1276971783
