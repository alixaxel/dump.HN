Hi all, I have been trying to enable core dumps for windows, and it is suprising that there is virtually no documentation for this. All I could find was 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb787181%28VS.85%29.aspx
but seems to not work on windows 2008.
Any Windows hackers around here that could help me?<p>Also, does anyone know a good forum for asking windows related questions? The Microsoft one really sucks.",1277777947

You don't want to use mutt's built-in IMAP support because it has to load a message (if it hasn't already been read) each time you to move to the next one. So rather than being able to zip through 1000 new messages in a mailing list every night without any delays, you have to sit there waiting a half second for each one to load as you read. Doesn't sound like much until you realize that's adding 10 minutes to a routine that would otherwise take about 20 or 30.<p>The setup shown in linked article is ok. But there's a better way.<p><a href=""http://wiki.github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.github.com/jgoerzen/offlineimap/</a><p>Creates a maildir from an IMAP account. Syncs read/unread, new messages, IMAP folder moves both ways. Supports filtering, renaming/mapping, and more. Has a special Gmail mode. I run mine on a cron job to pull new mail from various accounts every few hours, and then go through all of my mail once every couple of days when I feel like it.<p>I can run it on multiple computers to keep them all in sync. Unread/read status is correct and synched across multiple machines, messages aren't deleted from the server when you fetch them, reading messages is super fast, I can still use other IMAP clients if I want (like GUI clients, or my phone). Love it to death.<p>It's not updated very frequently anymore (at all?) but it still seems to work.

I suspect that they're either wrong or creatively fudging things.<p>After 100k your FICA payments taper off to nothing.  That's money off the top, right into your pocket.  Additionally, the capital gains taxes are only 15% compared to much higher for income.  This means that the wealthy have a hugely advantageous tax situation.<p>Although, I thought that the bottom of the top 5% was higher than 137k.  Another wiki here:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States#Quintiles"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_...</a> puts it at 157k, which is probably high enough to tilt the math towards what I was saying.

The said ""This judicial direction has resulted in substantial economic, technological, and societal benefit because software patents promote innovation both within and beyond the field of software"" and had a footnote to elaborate on that point.<p>The footnote said:<p>""Without the benefit of patent protection, software companies would be forced to rely on secrecy which limits the public’s ability to learn from software innovations, since patent documents are a significant source of technological disclosure. See, e.g., In re Alappat, 33 F.3d 1526, 1571 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (Newman, J., concurring). Given the reality that software source code is human readable, and object code can be reverse engineered, it is difficult for software developers to resort to secrecy. Thus, without patent protection, the incentives to innovate in the field of software are significantly reduced. Patent protection has promoted the free sharing of source code on a patentee’s terms—which has fueled the explosive growth of open source software development.""<p>Another interesting brief was the one from the FSF. They spent <i>13</i> <i>pages</i> on their ""Interest of Amicus Curiae"" section (where the submitter explains why they have an interest in the case). That's something like 40% of their brief.<p>In this 13 pages, they talk about how Linux should be called GNU/Linux, the 1992 US Air Force contract with NYU to produce a GPLed ADA compiler, how RMS is a genius, and much more. It reads like a press release.<p>For comparison, most of the rest manage to state their interest in a page or two, and then get on to their argument.",1277777056
