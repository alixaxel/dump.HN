1437694,comment,1437447,1437654,0,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I did a fair bit of research on the technical details of the Deepwater Horizon disaster. I, too, wanted to know why ""they"" didn't do X, Y, or Z, so I decided to find out. :-)<p>The first thing you need to know is that it's 5,000 feet from the surface of the ocean to the ocean floor at the well, and then there's another 18,000 feet of shaft below the ocean floor to the oil and gas reservoir. So, there's no clear position from which explosives can be used to ""seal"" it. If explosives were used, there's a pretty good chance it would blow up in our face, so to speak -- not only would the gas ignite (making the process somewhat unpredictable), but it would also likely create a huge number of microfissures that would lead to an even bigger oil geyser.<p>How catastrophic is it? It's ... well, not to be dramatic, but if this doesn't end up being one of the nastier long-term natural catastrophes of the next few decades, then I shudder to imagine what's coming next. Not only is this killing seabirds and mammals, it's also de-oxygenating a large portion of the Gulf rather nicely.<p>If BP does stick to their commitment to pay for the whole thing, I expect that they will file for bankruptcy next year. (In large part because their market cap is dropping like a rock.)<p>This particular incident is sort of the perfect storm of conditions for an oil disaster: it occurred at challenging depths, and when efforts have been made to stop the leak at those depths, something has gone wrong each time to stall or defeat the effort.<p>For further perspective: the US Navy's Seawolf class submarine has a crush depth of approximately 3,000 feet. At that depth, you're dealing with around 2,000 psi of pressure, but that's not the nasty part: the gusher is estimated to be at around 12,000 psi.<p>So, yeah. Explosives are probably not a wise idea here.",1276739611

1437691,comment,1437447,1437670,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Umm, is it just me or aren't they already doing IVF treatments between rhino species to use the more prevalent species to recover the virtually extinct species to aid in re-population efforts.<p>Why is it such a hard leap that the DNA of recently extinct (as in holding the last one in your hands) cannot be recovered and used to perform similar methods. If you've got the species you can harvest the eggs and sperm and produce thousands of offspring.<p>It's exceptionally naive to say ""no amount of money can bring back extinct species"" because you just have no grasp of what money can actually buy. If I can harvest the complete DNA of several animals from one species, including their mitochondrial, you can easily reproduce the species by emptying one of the species native eggs and filling it with the harvested foreign material, by all standards that I've read it should survive until gestation (assuming regular IVF failure rates for the species) and resurrect a species.<p>You don't need an African Elephant to give birth to African Elephant babies, because an Asian Elephant will do a suitable job. In fact it's believed an African (IIRC) elephant would be a suitable enough host to resurrect a mammoth (mitochondrial DNA would be required due to its specializations).<p>Please any amount of money can do virtually anything. It's currently engineeringly feasible to construct a gigantic nuclear powered mass driver on the moon to turn it into a world ship . . . or alternatively a massive billiard ball to explode mercury with. It's far, far, <i>far</i> from practical, but screw radiation shielding and deploy a few gigantic RTG's onto the moon and your money is getting what you want.<p>Money is a direct equivalent to resources, which is the entire point of why we use it as a common currency instead of arguing over how much steel a bar of gold is worth and how many bars of gold it would take to turn said steel into a car. If you have the money/resources, you can do anything physically possible.",1276739564

I'm working on a side-by-side comparison of RestBackup and other services.<p>RestBackup receives the data from the customer via HTTPS and submits it to S3 also over HTTPS.  So the data is encrypted in-transit but remains in S3 as-is.  This is the minimum viable product.  I'm considering encrypted storage as a feature for the public Beta.<p>RestBackup has per-request charges for the same reason that S3 and CloudFiles have them: to avoid losing money on high-volume request loads on small files.

The only reason (seemingly) that she got the job was that after the collapse of the previous government the new leftist coalition needed someone to pass the buck to, and she was pretty much the only uncontroversial figure they had.<p>Her coalition government's only redeeming quality has been to suck less than their predecessors which facilitated the giant ponzi scheme which took down the economy. They're wasting a lot of effort on the equivalent of rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.<p>One shining moment of incompetence was the press conference right after the president announced that the Icesave debt repayment bill would go to a public referendum.<p>She announced (well, mumbled actually) that the government was ""disappointed"" in the President's decision to bring the matter to a vote in a rushed international press conference hours after the announcement.<p>What they should have done is explain calmly that this was part of the democratic process in Iceland, and how the result might affect any future debt repayment.<p>Examples like these and countless others have shown that her and her government can't think two steps ahead, manage PR and foreign diplomacy horribly, and generally seem more interested in their pet leftist issues (which they can finally shove through, now that they're in power) rather than solving the problems facing the nation.<p>But what do I care, I moved abroad shortly after this all went down.",1276739360

1437637,comment,1436785,1437336,0,0,stephenjudkins,,,"Well, for a big enough project something like Guice will become necessary sooner or later.  However, for smaller programs traits are simpler to use and get one 80% of Guice's functionality--and it's all built into the language.  Traits are relatively easy to understand that any reasonably competent developer should be able to easily reason about.  I don't see why a Scala-native DI framework wouldn't be able to leverage this existing, simple solution to build the last 20%.<p>Guice is the result of smart Google engineers who had probably tried all sorts of DI frameworks before and finally developed something nice.  It's the result of more than a decade of painful experiences with existing solutions to a real problem.<p>In conclusion, I think you can hang yourself when using any language.  In Scala, when I needed to mock out a dependency for a project, I settled on a fairly simple trait-based approach that was simple and elegant.  In Java, I could have rolled by own Factory scheme that would be ugly and unmaintainable, or picked a DI framework that hopefully wouldn't have sucked.  In this case I was presented with many fewer opportunities to make a mess than if I had been using Java.<p>(BTW, you can use Guice in Scala programs right now!  And, when you do, it looks way nicer and easier to use than in Java.

1437635,comment,1436625,1436625,0,0,grellas,,,"From reading this fascinating piece, I (as one who is not technically proficient in any of the relevant areas) would conclude that AI-based approaches to computing can work well in the following areas: (1) you can program something in accordance with a strict set of limited rules and achieve amazing results, such as in computer chess, where today the advanced machines can basically outdo humans in playing that particular game, e.g., Deep Blue; (2) you can program something to use layered algorithms to find high degrees of probability that a particular objectively knowable fact is correct in response to someone inquiring about that fact, e.g. I.B.M. Watson; (3) you can custom-program something to enable someone to determine other forms of objectively verifiable relationships (such as mathematical comparisons or outcomes), e.g., Wolfram Alpha; and, (4) you can (at least theoretically) hard-wire a database to yield objective facts drawn from a vast body of custom knowledge manually programmed into a machine, albeit at an enormous cost in time and effort, thus gaining the benefits of mass storage, instant retrieval, and rapid replication but without drawing on the iterative power of computing devices and potential algorithmic solutions to the problem.<p>To me, all such approaches appear to throw in the towel on the question, ""can AI-based computing ever achieve the equivalent of exercising human judgment?""<p>For example, in law, all sorts of questions can arise to which there is no ""mechanical"" answer - what is the best strategy to employ in a particular legal fight or litigation? what, among an array of complex alternatives involving tax, business risk, liability risk, and human factors, is the optimum way to merge two companies? or even the simpler but still judgment-based decision, is it best for me to set up my company in the form of an LLC or a corporation or some other form and what domicile should I choose? or involving personal decisions such as what techniques do I use to raise and train my kids in terms of education, morals, setting life goals, etc.<p>Are there AI proponents out there who believe that AI-based computing can ever handle such issues? To me, it seems evident that no algorithmic approach will ever be able to rise to the level of addressing such problems but this may just be based on my ignorance and lack of imagination.<p>Going back to law, for example, the article suggests that IBM may one day capitalize upon using a Watson-type machine to help people answer bureaucratic questions. I wonder about this if the approach is based purely on probabilities because, no matter what the data set, no one could ever know for sure that the answer is the correct one. At most, the AI-device could say, ""this likely is a good starting point"" and, beyond that, you are on your own to confirm whether it is accurate or not (which, of course, could make for a tremendously helpful resource in itself, as long as it is used properly).<p>I would think any such method would become hopelessly confused, though, in dealing with some knotty tax question, as for example, ""determine my unrealized built-in gain in my C corp so that I know how much tax I have to pay on converting to S-corp status"" (see here for the methodology on this, which is mind-numbing for all but CPAs steeped in tax minutiae: <a href=""http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Treasury_Regulations,_Subchapter_A,_Sec._1.1374-3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.taxalmanac.org/index.php/Treasury_Regulations,_Su...</a>). I could imagine a custom-programmed approach dealing with such questions but only one that is very specific to the problem at hand.<p>Don't mean to go on - I truly found this piece quite intriguing since, before reading it, I would (out of ignorance) have laughed at anyone who would have claimed that an AI-based machine could play ""Jeopardy"" in any meaningful way.<p>So my question to those who are knowledgeable in the HN community is this: are there other conceptual approaches that, given sufficient time and resources will potentially be capable of rising to the level where they can address the higher-level (judgment-based) sorts of issues I identify above or is this basically it?<p>For anyone interested, the Hollywood view of this sort of thing appeared in the 1957 movie ""Desk Set,"" where a ""Miss Watson"" administered a machine called EMMANAC, which could give instant answers to questions expressed as normal people would ask them. This clip highlights the view of AI-computing as depicted in that movie: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdl9ynODxbk&feature=related"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rdl9ynODxbk&feature=relat...</a>.

Therefore attempting to cap it will just cause it to leak out the sea floor below anything we can reach.  The only choice is to let the oil out and try to catch it.
