How would consultants make their money if this was easier to figure out?<p>It's natural for any smart person to ask ""Why would someone who sells energy want to drive energy efficiency?.""<p>The short version is utility spending on energy efficiency is largely driven by 2 key factors - one is regulation and the other is capital deferral.<p>On the regulation side, it's 31 flavors... E.g. you have decoupling, renewable portfolio standards which have efficiency components, efficiency portfolio standards, mandates to target all cost effective savings (e.g. WA), etc... Some flavor of this applies to about 35 of the 50 states.<p>On the capital deferral side, it's more about a utility getting more rate payers on the same capital assets. Turns out it's not easy to permit a new coal based power plant. So more users on existing plant may mean less revenue but more profit depending on the circumstances.  In some markets (e.g. FL) the utility commission lets the utility charge consumers for conservation programs. So in these case, the utility has effectively marginal CGS/OPEX on a program which drives up profitability.",1276724339

Now, the simplest thing to do is move rapidly back & forth between 2 viewpoints, but there are other things one could do. For example, move the viewpoint <i>smoothly</i> from one point to another and then back. Or you could move the view point smoothly in a small circle. Etc. Want to reduce flicker?
