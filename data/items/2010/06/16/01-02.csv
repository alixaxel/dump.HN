I've been doing it since I was 6 (I'm 26 now).  I went to the bowling alley as often as possible, I'd ride my bike down after school whenever I had money.  In high school, I bought monthly memberships and would bowl 10-15 games a day, every day.  I just couldn't get enough of it.<p>The past few years I've been averaging in the 220s, which is great, but not professional great yet.  In the next few years, when I'm more financially stable, I'm going to try out the PBA Tour, if for nothing else but the experience.<p>I bowl so much that I developed bone spurs in my elbow that I had surgically removed a couple of weeks ago.  I haven't bowled now for over 4 months, which is the longest break I've ever taken.<p>Moral of the story is, you don't decide to practice something, you do it because you can't imagine not doing it.",1276653301

We (meaning normal, functional human beings) all have the ability from a young age to sympathize with others. We have a strong desire to be part of a group. We feel guilt when we do something socially wrong. Intimate relationships release endorphins that give us pleasure. Language itself is only necessary in a strongly social species.<p>Honestly, I can't fathom human society as it is today beginning from small, isolated groups of people who are strong individualists. Only a select few of us can survive happily by ourselves, and I suspect that's been true for millennia. Our ability to cooperate and evolve socially, as opposed to biologically, is what has allowed us to become the most dominant species on Earth.",1276653249

Good teachers will often work on this with students by asking how the student thought something went (""Was that better or worse than last time? What was better about it?"") before offering their own feedback.  This isn't easy, but it's critical.<p>When I'm practicing, sometimes I'm just doing something wrong.  If I can't fix it or I can't even figure out what it is, but I know it doesn't feel right, sometimes I just stop that practice session.  That's when I know I'll be practicing improper technique.

1434447,comment,1433460,1434433,0,0,cheald,,,"Yes. MongoDB doesn't ensure a write to disk before returning on an insert operation (it is what is called ""eventually consistent"") in order to maintain high write throughput. Because it uses memory-mapped files, it can't address anything larger than a 32-bit pointer on a 32-bit system, and so you would execute an insert, and when the DB eventually tries to write it to disk, it would fail due to lack of resources. Because the write is asynchronous, the client doesn't realize that the data has not been serialized to disk, and you end up with effective data loss. Fixing this would require either a) not using memory-mapped files, or b) ensuring full durability on writes, both of which would massively slow down the data store as a whole.",1276652907

Human spaceflight can continue with Soyuz for now and with SpaceX if and when they are ready. The Dragon can also ride a Delta. Also, the Orion was not canned, AFAIK, so, it too can ride a Delta IV to LEO, as soon as Delta IV's get man-rated. As for the freight capacity, a Delta IV Heavy can carry as heavy a payload as a shuttle (not sure about dimensions), so, there is no loss of capability. A shuttle is a 100 ton vehicle with 30 ton payload. That's 70 more than you need.<p>If we are to escape Earth, we need something much better than chemical rockets. We may need them to reach LEO, but, from then on, we need to perfect more efficient ways to move. The shuttle is a dead end. We need modular systems that can be assembled in varied ways to suit a given mission profile. The shuttle is perfect for one thing and one thing only - to bring truck-sized payloads back from LEO. For all other uses, it is much more expensive than its competition and the only thing that kept it in operation was an absurd determination that prevented development of other vehicles.<p>Don't get me wrong - it's a beautiful machine, but it should never be the only system available, for it is unsuitable for just about every real usage.",1276652346

1434425,comment,1433729,1433729,0,0,alecco,,,"There's some really good advice on this thread. FWIW, here's  my take.<p>You are <i>living two lives at the same time</i>. It's possible to do it, but you have to sacrifice and avoid traps. You have to acknowledge you will be vulnerable due to tiredness. Your main pitfall is falling into depression, despair and alienation. Here are some very simple techniques I use. It is vital to achieve a good mindset and excellent health.<p><i>Master your time</i> and in particular your sleep. Every day <i>sleep at least 8 hours</i>. Don't moonlight if possible. Wake up very early in the morning, 5 or 6am maximum. Go for a walk or a run, then have a very quick healthy and filling breakfast (avoid boxed cereals!) If you have time, work some on your project. Get to work before anybody else, get sort everything you can in the morning as everybody else is drowsy and slow. Exploit that. Master the ""wally reflector"", perhaps preemptively.<p>For lunch time, have something very light like a sandwich or salad. Push meetings to the afternoon, if possible. Focus well on people talking to you, don't multitask on meetings. Avoid the water-cooler gang, don't waste your time even at the office, remember you are worn out more than your co-workers. If you need to <i>clear your mind, go to a quiet place and rest</i>. Do the same at lunch, if possible.<p>After work, avoid the pub and go straight to your project and put as many good hours as you can. If you work at home, get rid of any possible distraction, in particular <i>avoid time sinks like TV, social sites, and chat/im</i>. Hold dinner until you are done.<p>Drink water all the time, perhaps a glass every hour. Avoid any other soft drinks. Eat healthier, get enough nutrients in particular good proteins (milk, egg whites, soy) to help you recover. Also don't neglect good oils (sunflower, algae/fish.) A healthy lifestyle will help you save money, too.<p>Stay away as much as possible from coffee because it will give you insomnia and stomach problems while in the long run you end up with a dependency and without the buzz. Avoid alcohol (and soft drugs), its effects will cascade into the week because you are vulnerable. Avoid heavy and unhealthy foods, it will give you indigestion and get you drowsy. Stop eating sugars, candy, chocolate, and soft drinks.<p>When you are feeling bad at work, visualize your goals. Repeat to yourself often, perhaps in a mirror: ""this is just a stepping stone and I'm moving forward to my dream life."" Or something along the lines better fitting your situation.<p>Keep completely to yourself either Saturday or Sunday, zero work. Have a good time.<p>Now the hardcore tricks. In just 2 weeks you can clean up from the typical western sugar addiction. Hang in there with your cravings. Only when you are completely in control, you can have a little bit of <i>sugar as last-resource remedy</i> to help you get by when you reach very low points of the week. Drink lots of water with it to even out the effects from 15m to 45m. Don't eat or drink anything else. Sugar is a strong stimulant and an occasional shot can help keep discipline, but it works only if you don't have resistance to it. (There are several studies on this subject.)<p>Another trick is to schedule properly the work that wears you out. Put it all together and finish it as soon as possible, then resume your normal schedule.<p>And the best trick is to go to bed early on Sunday night, perhaps get your doctor to prescribe your some light sleep inducing pills. Some people swear by herbal remedies, too. When you start the week with the right foot it tends to have a good inertia.<p>And the top trick, <i>write a log</i>! Even if you write a single line it will help you keep focus and will help you become aware of progress. Write it even on bad days, highlight what  went wrong. It takes just a minute.<p>Even though this is a hard life, if you manage to do it right it will be among the best times of your life. Things will change sooner than you expect.",1276651837

Many good teachers know that grade systems cheat students out of serious educations. (And incentivize them to become cheaters.) Yet few win enough power to teach as they think best and neutralize this whole class of problems.<p>Coincidentally, I'm taking an ungraded class. Though I didn't really notice until now. There is homework, but doing it is completely at our discretion. It could only possibly work if we're self-motivated, and it works fine.<p>Come to think of it, it's unlikely that my viewpoint is shared by only a tiny minority. After all, commenters here cite astonishingly high rates of plagiarism, like ""literally... more than half"".

But it begs the question, how does one practice the ""proper"" technique (I mean after all, doesn't everyone want to follow the correct form of shooting hoops/strumming a guitar chord, but most people don't have a dedicated shooting coach/guitar teacher to watch their every move or they do know the right technique by heart in theory but can't carry it out in practice for various reasons).<p>The best protip I've received in learning an instrument (and actually doing anything) is when you are stuck at a particular exercise, move onto the next hardest exercise anyways. When you stumble upon the simplest guitar lick on the first page of a guitar book,you might say ""are you crazy? I can't even play the first exercise."" But if you play the next hardest lick and stumble upon it for a couple of days, then try to play a third lick even harder than the second lick for a couple of days, and then go back to the very first lick. You might find that you can now play it pretty well, or suck much less than before.<p>Yes, practicing is all about hard work and all that, but it is also about momentum and keeping things fresh and new. If it's not fun, you are doing something wrong.",1276650493
