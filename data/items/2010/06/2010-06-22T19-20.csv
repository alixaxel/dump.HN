Hundreds of high-caliber scientists and engineers chose to avoid working for the Nazis or the Fascists and fled elsewhere.</i><p>But the point is you can't for certain say that (statistically you probably would have ended up doing it, or be dead, one of the two). Who knows if we'd have seen it coming in time, or been privileged enough to get out, or not made a decision to stay and try to protect your people, etc. Hundreds of thousands <i>did</i> work and fight beneath the Nazi government (some by choice, some by default). At what point do you stop being a victim and it turns into making a morally wrong choice?<p>EDIT: it's worth pointing out that we can assume any rational man with a knowledge of history would choose to run for it. But that's cheating :)<p>It's hard to make an outright judgement on this guy. I agree he made a very wrong choice to stick with the Nazi's - but we do not know how he viewed things, what he saw etc. Partly because we were not there (generally, at the time) and partly because he doesn't seem to have told anyone his decisions/feelings (that I can find).<p>And <i>this</i> is my gripe; discussing the fact he made a choice (that we consider poor) to work for the Nazi government is one thing. But the insinuation was much wider than that; and <i>that</i> is very wrong :) The implication is that he was on-board with the sick things that they did; and <i>that</i> is disingenuous (my gf just pointed out that a modern equivalent could be saying a Mr Joe Bloggs, by working in a US science lab, is in support of the Guantanamo Bay detentions).<p>One of my German friends made a very important point to me once. Which is basically that it is easy to forget that the Nazi's were an elected government prior to the war - and that they were viewed quite positively for a short while. The descent into war was swift (as these things go) and pretty brutal. It's easy to sit here and make claims about what we would have done, or judge those working for the government but really it's bunk to do so. He also points out that there was a distinct difference between the Nazi government and the Nazi party - the problem was they shared the same crazed leadership.<p>(interesting discussion btw)",1277236294

Google voice to the rescue.<p>First apparent problem (not so bad). The speach to text is horrible. Maybe 40% of the voicemail was correctly transcribed. maybe less.  But never really useful. Ever. I only got the gist of if I should or should not listen to the voicemail, which really is good enough for me because it solved my voicemail problem.<p>Second hidden problem (maaaaaaaajor, the reason I quit): Calls are not instantly forwarded. This might sound like I am picky, but check this out: If for 3 out of 4 rings the call is being forwarded, I only realize someone is calling when they hang up. (this feature was necessary so that people calling my regular cell would immediately get my google voice voicemail vs my regular voicemail). Actually often the forwarding would be so slow that the person already got to voicemail by the time my cellphone rang. People mostly thought my cell was off.<p>So overall until their speeds SIGNIFICANTLY increase I can't use gv. And I am not even doing this as a business. So their little graph of how google voice revolutionizes telephony is kinda bs. Wait 5 years and the pudding will tell.<p>What is nice is if I DONT use my gv number, then I can switch away from it without problem. If people start only calling my gv phone number I will be trapped in the crappiness of google voice. I am glad they let me use my regular phone number vs gv phone number.",1277235746

What seems clear is that the federal government has been pressed by what happened on the Deepwater Horizon into an otherwise sweeping confirmation that all Gulf deepwater drilling activities put us all in a universal threat of irreparable harm. While the implementation of regulations and a new culture of safety are supportable by the Report and the documents presented, the blanket moratorium, with no parameters, seems to assume that because one rig failed and although no one yet fully knows why, all companies and rigs drilling new wells over 500 feet also universally present an imminent danger.<p>On the record now before the Court, the defendants have failed to cogently reflect the decision to issue a blanket, generic, indeed punitive, moratorium with the facts developed during the thirty-day review. The plaintiffs have established a likelihood of successfully showing that the Administration acted arbitrarily and capriciously in issuing the moratorium.</i><p>As a matter of law, I suspect the judge does know what he's doing.  And we are, or at least aspire to be, a nation that lives under the rule of law, not men.<p>Also, as he notes: ""no one yet fully knows why"", which is very different from ""no explanation why"".  We know <i>quite</i> a bit about how this happened, probably enough to prevent it from happening again with the current state of the art.<p>BP wasn't following industry best practices, wasn't listening to its subcontractor, saw a bunch of large red flags as previously noted in in submissions to HN, etc. etc.  Prior to the inevitable new regulations, we can have a reasonable expectation that other drillers will pay sufficient attention to all this and avoid another nasty blowout anytime soon.<p>After all, the last one was 30 years ago (Ixtoc I); the real danger will be when people become complacent again.",1277235412

It's important to be clear, as you pointed out. (Btw, when I say ""high cholesterol,"" I mean elevated LDL-C.) The correlation coefficient between ApoB and repeat LDL-C measurements is high enough as to make the (more expensive) ApoB not worth measuring except for research purposes; though I'd be happy to measure ApoB directly, doing so would change very little. It's certainly not ""much better."" There is actual research, and then there is clinical junk like taking ratios of different lipoprotein species; that doesn't help you get to the heart of the problem.

There are subtler deviations from the simplest random models, too; for instance, if you just pretend that each number n is (independently) prime with probability 1 / log n, you get what appears to be the wrong answer for the density of twin primes (pairs n,n+2 both of which are prime).<p>So no, ""random as far as we currently know"" is a pretty terrible description of the distribution of prime numbers.",1277233576

Choose supporting professionals that match your risk tolerance.  The self-employed can be very aggressive regarding taxes, litigation, and financial engineering (and likewise accept more risk of audits and penalties.)  If you want to be aggressive, choose an aggressive CPA and an aggressive lawyer.  If you're more conservative, do the opposite.  Don't expect that a professional will be conservative just because she works for a larger firm.  In fact, the opposite is often the case.<p>- Get a business checking account and a business credit card.  Many banks offer free checking and no fee credit cards to small businesses.  Try to be good about using the business accounts only for business expenses and you'll be much better off at tax time.<p>- Open a high-yield money market or savings account.  Don't let your cash sit around in the checking account.  Even with today's crappy interest rates, you can make a few bucks each month.  Your bank might have good rates or you can look at Everbank or Capital One.  (Costco members get a rate bonus at Capital One.)<p>- Set up a retirement plan.  A solo 401(k) or SEP-IRA is simple to set up and you can save a ton of money for retirement and help save on your taxes.  A solo 401(k) lets you contribute the most (up to $49,000/year,) but it's a more of a pain to maintain, especially if you plan to have employees.  Talk to your CPA about which is right for you.  T. Rowe Price, Vanguard, and many of the other big financial firms offer cheap or low-cost small business retirement accounts.<p>- Talk to a CPA and ask them to explain how to pay yourself a regular salary, withhold taxes, withhold retirement contributions, etc.  Actually doing the payroll yourself is not hard, but there are plenty of companies that will administer your payroll for $30 - 60/month if you don't want to do it.<p>- The more clients and expenses you have, the more you need some sort of accounting package.  If you have one or two clients and few expenses, a spreadsheet is probably fine for bookkeeping.
