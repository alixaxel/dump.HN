Why not just negotiate for that yourself?<p>Because certain portions of our field have jobs that people are willing to be whipped and beaten for if they can get the jobs (entry level game programming, I'm looking at you).<p>There isn't anything about programming that makes it reasonable to require unpaid overtime exemptions, etc, unlike most other fields have. It's merely poor management demanding it.<p>Game programming, especially, would be nice, as there is no reason to make games come out faster, they're <i>pure entertainment</i> without just recompense for hours worked. A heavy preponderance of unions would deescalate the field, making everyone do less over a given period of time (or pay people much better than they do for the overtime they demand).",1276113537

In the freemium scenario, it would be like charging extra to be able to access the website from more than one computer.

Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 (a game I have not interest in, personally) sold 4.7 million units in it's first day. That's 3 times as many units in 24 hours as the entire year of StarCraft sales you quoted.  Over 5 million sales in it's first month in the US alone, compared to 9.5 million over 10 years worldwide for StarCraft.  Was StarCraft a big deal in it's heyday?  Sure, no one is trying to deny that.  But compared to the modern gaming industry, it's a drop in the bucket.  Modern Warfare 2 apparently has approx. 25 million unique players as of March 2010.  We live in a world now where a video game release can outdo a major motion picture in openning weekend profits.

Again - reality is that most of the people can not read code and sourcode or even executable binary is almost equal to 90% of the population. Biggest advantage of SaaS is that it can provide value that normal ""behind the firewall"" software can not match. What kind of value? I.e. cost reduction (thanks to consolidation effect).

We don't have that program on our computers at all, and in fact the issue of free software versus proprietary [only] arises for software that we're going to have on our computers and run on our computers. We're gonna have copies and the question is, what are we allowed to do with those copies? Are we just allowed to run them or are we allowed to do the other useful things that you can do with a program? If the program is running on somebody else's computer, the issue doesn't arise.

(Not <i>all</i> of it has been bad: I've known a few good ones from India and Uruguay, but they were the exception rather than rule.) I chalk this up to several factors. One, most so-called developers are bad, period, regardless of nationality. Second, in the low-cost developing nations that folks most associate with offshore development (India, the poster boy) the average years of experience is much lower. Third, there's the language, cultural and distance obstacles. And fourth, and possibly not least important factor: low prices mess up the quality-is-price signaling mechanism. Is a particular offshore developer seeking a low hourly rate purely due to geographical/economic effects? Or is it due to them being lower skilled or having less experience, or needing to take more hours or developers to do the same task? Perhaps it is a mix of these factors.",1276112524

This is a bit different than the photovoltaic cells which I believe this map is referencing; It involves capturing heat and turning it in to electricity rather than light. This is mainly just research right now, but if it pans out it could potentially be much more practical than photovoltaic cells because it doesn't require as many precious materials to manufacture and stores energy at night.

I'm sure getting kicked out of Apple was devistating, and cause much soul searching. The 'what would I do different next time' theme had to have been there.<p>He went on to found NeXT which never became a smashing success, but was likely another huge learning experience. If Jobs was so infallible and could lead any tech company, why did NeXT not have the same success as Apple did initally?<p>Then he went off and worked in a completely (or mostly) different industry with Pixar. That must have been a HUGE learning experience. Now he not only had media contacts, but really new the inner workings of that industry.<p>With Pixar, Jobs was now working with more artists, learning more about aesthetics, animation, etc. All the while, the technology industry was still growing in this area, and the core of these technologies was not yet available to the personal computer.<p>THEN, he goes back to Apple. He's got a better understaning of aesthetics, and character development, and he leads with some really innovative designs. I wasn't a huge fan of that first iMac, but that lamp base type one was truly a character and a computer all at once. Much more personable.<p>Then he gets into music with the iPod. Now he's able to better use the expertise he's gained from all his previous experiences.<p>iPod goes into movies, media and technology are blending faster than ever before.<p>I ask, if Steve Jobs hadn't been ousted from Apple originally, would Apple be what it is today?",1276110588

Only one project was what I would consider at all successful, and in that case, the US company was owned and managed by several people originally from China, and some development work was outsourced to China, to a company owned by the president's brother.  How that managed to work, I'm still not completely sure, but it actually did, for the most part.<p>In the other cases, the costs were much greater than expected, both because the companies we outsourced work to did not perform as expected, and because we had to spend extra time managing them and correcting their mistakes.  The poor quality of work by the company we outsourced to was the main reason I left one job - I just did not believe the company could survive given the quality of the product.  Plus I was tired of putting in 60-80 hour weeks trying to make up for the crappy job they were doing.",1276110557

If I make a typo and try to save it, it'll tell me this variable isn't declared and ask me how I'd like to declare it.<p>Using the wrong variable, I just never seem to have that problem as well named variables make the code just look wrong when it happens and secondly because I'm writing the code while the code is running in a live environment.  I see immediately when it does work because the first thing I do is execute it on a live object to make sure it does what it's supposed to do.  This handles the null issue as well.  Incremental live development just side steps about all of these issues, and is something static languages just don't let me do.<p>More often than not, I've found type systems to prevent me from expressing what I want to express even when the code would work perfectly fine simply because polymorphism isn't granular enough.  In dynamic type systems, polymorphism is based on method signature alone and is not bound to any kind of class/interface/type class which gives me the most flexibility in expressing myself.
