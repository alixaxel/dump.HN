If you don't take the plunge now you'll end up leaving a perfectly good career at 31 to do it anyway (most likely after reading a pg essay like myself).<p>1. Hackers learn by doing. If you enjoy tackling problems you're 3/4 of the way there. If you have ideas, you're 3/4 of the way there. Combining those two will fill in the other blanks for you. What language you use would depend on the problem space. When you pick a problem, you could always poll here for suggestions.<p>2. Don't worry if they're better or worse than you, just seek out people who love doing it. They'll eclipse everyone else in short order anyway.<p>My only add on advice is I would assume you have more college options than what you've stated. If you do like programming, you really can't go wrong at this point in history with a degree in it. I would look for less time consuming options.<p>Seriously, start your new life today. Pick a problem and start hacking away at it. Start hacking away at college options and start seeking out hacker meetups (you'll have plenty of options in NY).<p>Above all, enjoy it. Good luck.",1276657152

1434549,comment,1399956,1399956,0,0,lukelockhart,,,"This is (IMHO) how you should go about doing it yourself:<p>1)  First of all find out who your looking to speak to.  Airlines are huge.  Who in the airlines owns the process/es that your solution addresses?  Who in the organization would benefit on a day to day level from your solution?  
- If you can't find this info from secondary research your going to have to try to speak to someone in the industry who can help you figure this out.<p>2)  Contacting People 
- Try your best to get an introduction from someone (Anyone - friend of a friend, in-law's cousin, alumni, whatever) in your network to someone in the airline.  They don't have to be the right contact to begin with.  Sometimes they're just contacts to get more contacts.  
- I agree with what others have said about big companies being harder to break into.  People at smaller companies often know counterparts in larger companies.  So this can be a good first step.
- Cold calling probably has the lowest success rate (you will have to make a ton of calls to even speak to someone useful)
- Random LinkedIn messages are better, but will go mostly unanswered.  
- Join their forums, groups, sign up for their blogs.<p>I could go on, but I have an incubator interview myself tomorrow I have to prep for.",1276656993

I've never done any programming before and so armed with Google I tackled the program. I ended up with an Access Database written in VBA, that barely functioned, and how I could not have completely said.<p>I loved the process. The problem solving, the designing of the interface, the whole thing was just extremely fun. After that I started learning vb.net and rewrote the whole program. It still needs a lot of work and I am now learning c# and planning on rewriting it again. This whole thing has inspired me to become a developer. Technology and business was something I always enjoyed, I've been reading Gizmodo and TechCrunch for a while now, but now I see the creative process and analytical skills that software developers use, and I really want to do this as a career.<p>I have been reading Hacker News and talking to people who work in the field as to what it is that I should be doing now, and the general consensus is to just go out and do something. While this is something I would love to do, (I have a ton of ideas I would like to work on) and on some level I feel like I need to do it, (i need to make some money, nothing major more like 1000 a month, and I want to keep motivated to keep learning) I run into two main problems:<p>1) I do not have knowledge required to execute my ideas. 
I have been programming for only about 6 months, (at most, depending on what you consider programming.), and the languages that I know are limited to vb.net and c#. These are not exactly high level languages themselves, and my knowledge of them is mediocre at best. I don't have the knowledge to execute any of the ideas I have.<p>2) I do not have any friends who share this particular interest. I don't know any code gurus or anyone I can rely on for advice or as a co founder, and I have no way of meeting anyone who would fit into that category. And if I did meet someone, I don't know enough to be able to tell if they where actually good or just better than me.<p>I have the opportunity to switch to Columbia University's engineering program  on a 3 - 2 program with my college. Which means I do 3 years at my college, and will major in math and get a degree in mathematics, and then do two years in Columbia and get a CS degree from there. I feel like this would solve both my problems, but it will take 4 more years of school, and I will have to pay Columbia tuition.<p>I really want to start something but I feel like I can't. I've seen other people ask this before on Hacker news and most of the responses are ""Just do it anyways."" but that is really not helpfu in any way.<p>I was wondering if you can please give me advice on what to do. 
Thank you very much",1276655726

Mentally it's a really shitty experience and I'm not in a position where I have to settle for that. If I needed to do it to put food on the table, obviously I would.<p>You're also creating this false dichotomy between getting stuff done and documenting your code. I've never been in a position to have to choose between the two. If you have time to write a good program but not enough time to document it, I would question whether the program you wrote is actually good. If I'm writing a paper, sure I can spew shit out on a page for a couple hours and produce a ""paper"". But realistically if I'm actually going to produce a paper I need time for outlining and proofreading.<p>(Note that ""documentation"" isn't really what matters, it's that the code is understandable. If the code is self-documenting or the program is small enough, I consider that documented code.)",1276654250
