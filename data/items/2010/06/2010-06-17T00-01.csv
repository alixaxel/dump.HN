the decentralized nature of the Internet makes it nearly impossible to shut it down 100%. Perhaps we'll get to test
this empirically in a few years when the predicted increase in Solar storms fries a big portion the World's electronics.<p>However, I'd bet dollars to donuts that there exists a highly classified plan to shutdown the majority of the Internet if truly necessary

But now that iPads and iPhone are spreading all over the place like a blown out BP oil well, and the entire mobile industry is playing catch up to reach or emulate Apple's tight UI & design in software, it's time for Apple to throw AT&T to the Feds over something.

They've previously indicated that they'd be thrilled to have me show it off, and I'd be happy to write a ""how I built this"" or something for my blog linking to the results.<p>Fair warning: it is marketing material, in much the same sense that one of the NYT's data visualizations is marketing, except they have a business model which benefits in a more direct fashion than the NYT does.",1276732964

The Java 7 JVM will have the 'invokedynamic' instruction, plus a new Java API to manage it. Perhaps Scala will extend the language syntax at that time to allow dynamic typing, with that API underneath, for those few cases where dynamic typing's better.<p>A language that was dynamic first, then added the static, is Groovy and Groovy++.",1276732845
