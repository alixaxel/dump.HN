I'm not persuaded.<p>(a) Some of the colonial powers were small tribes or collections of tribes themselves. England is one example, as you say, but Belgium and Portugal are surely the poster children for this. Spain is <i>still</i> a vast collection of tribes more than anything else.<p>(b) Some of the colonized regions had strong central government, notably the Inka empire Tawantinsuyu.<p>(c) Forms of strong central government have existed in many times and places in the past (Carthage, the Roman Empire, arguably the Roman Catholic Church before Westphalia, ancient Egypt, Axum, China at some periods, Tawantinsuyu, the Maya empire) without kicking off an industrial revolution. Indeed, the argument has often been made that it was precisely Europe's lack of strong central government, together with the current state of philosophy, that permitted the Industrial Revolution to begin.",1276563256

Load current JVM on all of them and connect them to a network.<p>Then write a program that uses Hazelcast (<a href=""http://www.hazelcast.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hazelcast.com/</a>) that gives you a pseudo-distributed JVM cluster. It actually gives distributed Maps and Queues.<p>Then mount a bunch of Jetlang (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jetlang/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/jetlang/</a>) Fibers into the distributed Map. The Jetlang fibers provide thread-less concurrency.<p>Then develop a simple function-independent task framework, to which you can pass a function and a parameter map as two arguments, which calls a Callable and returns an Object.<p>Now create a bunch of tasks, mount them into fibers and mount the fibers into the distributed map.<p>Finally write a simple countdown latch based task runner, you can safely run four per core, and run them on each mac, sit and watch.<p>Be careful, you can easily destroy a few database servers..",1276563230

There are quite a few tricks the dedicated server market plays to keep costs inline when over-selling. Small hard drives, slower processors, overloaded routers, limits on usage (like how dreamhost won't let you use your 500GB of storage as backup), multiple tiers of bandwidth (I wouldn't be surprised if these servers are put into a specific prefix where all outgoing bandwidth from that bandwidth is sent over a mixture of low-end providers like Cogent/HE/Bandcon, and creative prefix announcements send most of the incoming bandwidth over one of those three providers as well).<p>There are at least a dozen things an operator could do in order to make an offering like this cost them nothing on the books, and on the same note they would still sell these servers in their closeouts/specials section, or use them as freebies in larger deals.",1276563021

1431463,comment,1430825,1430825,0,0,etal,,,"Oh my god, I hate journalists.<p>1. This is not an article about career opportunities for STEM (science, tech, engineering, math) majors -- of which there are plenty. This is about the <i>very specific</i> problem of there being a massive glut of Ph.D. students aiming for tenure-track academic jobs. The article makes no distinction here.<p>2. The problem of academia's imploding pyramid scheme is not at all limited to science. It's worse in the soft sciences and humanities -- picture the same situation of tenured professors overseeing teams of cringing graduate students, but without the NSF/NIH/DOD grant money to hire postdocs. Now, where do you go when you graduate? (Hint: you don't, unless you already have a job lined up.)<p>The article mentions the rules of supply and demand, but not in relation to tenure. Academia's cultural problem of deterring students from any career other than academic research gets a couple paragraphs near the bottom. <i>But that's the problem!</i> Regardless of the field, too many students are pushed into academic careers, but the world just doesn't need that many professors.<p>Lots of people love their job. It takes the arrogance of a professor to state that everyone should want yours.<p>3. Visa issues -- smart, talented students come from outside the U.S. to attend grad school on a student visa that prohibits non-academic work. They stay on as postdocs after graduation because every other kind of job is prohibited, unless some benevolent employer wants to lend a hand with the work visa application process, which probably won't happen. If they leave academia, they have to leave the U.S. Market distortion, anyone? Anyone with U.S. citizenship is clearly better off with a Master's or other professional degree; industry misses out on talent while academia suffers a labor glut.<p>4. Why does all scientific research have to be done by universities? If labs are funded with government money anyway, it's just as efficient (or more) to directly hire lab techs and researchers at government labs... assuming the research really is important. Academic labs are optimized for publishing journal articles, in absence of a better metric. Could we measure progress better by bringing the research work closer to the customer?",1276562159

So yes words are simplifications of reality, they encode the essential aspects of some part of reality - but their definitions are right or wrong depending on the truth or falsehood of the condensed observations. Rand observed that biologically developed men were autonomous agents with the ability to perceive, reason and conceptualize (ie. conscious, self-aware individuals) and proscribed an ethical theory accordingly. She declares her definition so if you want to invalidate it you need to refute those observations or the manner in which they're integrated into a single concept.<p>Individuals are extremely easy to recognize, we do it all the time. We just don't know exactly <i>how</i> all the systems supporting our individuality work, but then we don't know exactly how <i>all</i> the systems supporting <i>anything</i> work either. Quantum mechanics, anyone? Humans are rational animals: that means as animals they have all the usual biological considerations of growth/development/decay but the end product of that growth/development (when successful) is always a being with the type of consciousness (ie. awareness) that allows him/her to not only respond to the environment and act autonomously, but also to abstract, conceptualize, and reason.<p>Also I think you misinterpreted my last line - Rand is only addressing or 'trying to reach' life-forms who choose life. Of course they could choose to follow some other advice and still choose to live (although not wholly consistently, Rand would argue)",1276561974

But the exact number doesn't much matter.  You can set two instances of the visual angle equation equal (one for the unknown distance and one for the definition of retinal, an inch long at 11 inches distance), and simplify to give you what similar triangle ratios would too.  A length, s=D/11, for the side of the similar triangle opposite the eye, which by the operating definition of ""retinal"" has 300pixels along it.  So, we can use s as a scaling factor, 300ppi/(D/11)=""ppi you need at distance D to be retinal"".  Solve for D instead if you wish.<p>That might not even be clear with the diagram, sorry.",1276560866

1431419,comment,1427668,1430761,0,0,pbhjpbhj,,,">And I found it - they assumed a load factor of 100% for trains, but 72% for airplanes. When actually in the real world airplanes are pretty full and trains are not - but they run them anyway. And trains will probably use more fuel if they were full, so their entire study is worthless.<p>Fair enough, I can't be bothered to check your analysis, just like I cherry picked the citation. However assuming that the trains are full and aeroplanes aren't isn't really a problem here. Most long distance trains I've been on here are standing room only (except in 1st class). I've been on a few half full flights though most of the budget airlines are pretty good at getting full capacity.<p>There is a lot of competition in internal flight routes here but none on train routes. Train routes are monopolies. They do very strange things with train pricing - sometimes my MiL can get to us cheaper (via London, about 750km as the crow flies, 1 ticket) than we can visit the next town (about 20km, 4 tickets). Flights are priced using a scarcity model that makes early bookings almost the same as the taxes and later bookings as much as traditionally priced airlines.",1276560464
