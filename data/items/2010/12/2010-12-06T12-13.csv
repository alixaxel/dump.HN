If some critical thing gets missed, or I think the code isn't going to do what it's supposed to, I speak up.  (That includes syntax, but also logic.)  I sometimes (rarely) make suggestions about refactoring or tests that need to be done.<p>I will admit, though, that for a while we jokingly called it 'peer programming' because you were just peering over someone's shoulder.  We had a cowboy coder that taught us a LOT of stuff in the short time he was here and 'peer programming' was a large part of that.  His time here was disruptive, but I think the whole team is a lot more productive thanks to his short employment.  (And his disruptions were mostly him trying to convince everyone to do things a better way.)",1291637527

They would be equally simple to implement, yet DNSSEC would be hugely more beneficial.<p>I've never come across anyone using the SPF record type. nearly everyone just uses TXT for that.<p>I think DNSSEC was just an oversight on Amazons behalf.

This would allow links submitted days ago to end up on the front page if they were recently upvoted a lot. The new algorithm could be put on an alternate front page (similar to <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/classic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/classic</a>) until it was tweaked to get the desired result.<p>Since detection of duplicates and content mirrors is currently done best by humans, I think another aspect of the solution is cultural.
