2041287,comment,2040835,2041250,0,0,z0r,,,"I enjoyed writing Scala more than I enjoy writing Python, but there are a few undeniable advantages that Python holds over Scala. The motivation to port from Scala to Python was to avoid the lengthy build process that had been slowing down development to a crawl. There may have been other ways to alleviate this, but by the time the port was completed, it took a good 15 - 20 minutes to get the build machine to compile and package the entire project so it could be deployed to production. At this time rapid fixes were critical.<p>Also, the team as a whole prefers Python to Scala... I took pleasure in learning how to express my code in increasingly functional and compact ways, but my coworkers found struggling with the type system to be too much of a headache. In particular, there are rough edges when you are integrating Scala code with Scala types and data structures with Java code with Java types and data structures. In any case it will be easier to find programmers who write in Python than those who might write Scala.<p>Scala gave me more personal pleasure to write in, but Python isn't bad either. I miss the type system and the many classes of errors it could help prevent at compile time, but I appreciate being able to change Python code and put it to the test immediately.

Jeans, sweats and t-shirts are the new class separator, indicating which of us have earned the freedom from having to wear suits.</i><p>The key thing here is that there is a difference between aspiration and ability. Clothes unsuitable for labor merely indicate a commitment to an information occupation. Suits, expensive clothes that look good and are unsuitable for labor, also indicate a social commitment to the organization, a social commitment necessary to advance within the ranks.<p>In many, if not most, software firms, the way to success is upward through management. For a while, it was through stock options or stock grants. In the latter two scenarios, no social commitment was necessary, so come-as-you-are became the norm.<p>Come-as-you-are seems to survive for two other reasons. Firstly, the class distinction between partners & the board vs the line-level programmers has to do with ownership, and no amount of coding, whether performed in jeans or in a suit, can help you over that barrier within the organization. Secondly and consequently, the route across that social divide, for the line-level programmer, is via a start-up effort undertaken as a side project, outside the social structure of the worker's organization.<p>These trends are not heading in a direction that portends an infinite ocean of denim and sweats, but rather for a re-emergence of business casual or even smart casual in the workplace for programmers, and again for suits in the managing establishment. Suits are a signifier that someone is adept at controlling other humans and getting them to perform work for them. The ability to get computers to do useful (capital-capturing) work has upended this temporarily. As this algorithmic market commoditizes, or at least as the exploitable niches fill, the ability to control people instead of machines will become more important again. Even without commoditization and niche-capture, the fitness advantage of being able to control and manage an organization still portends a crystallization of an owning class, complete with ownership regalia, the suit.<p>The short of it is this: If you program for another organization and don't have an amazing side-project, you might consider the slacks-and-jacket smart casual look if you want to move ahead.",1293402178

But I decided that the big elements need to have a certain familiarity in order to make the app's purpose more obvious at a glance.

2041276,comment,2041154,2041154,0,0,mbm,,,"This reminds me of a quote I read from a lecture a few years back by a history prof at Colby:<p>""How long will you need to find your truest, most productive niche? This I cannot predict, for, sadly, access to a podium confers no gift of prophecy. But I can say that however long it takes, it will be time well spent. I am reminded of a friend from the early 1970s, Edward Witten. I liked Ed, but felt sorry for him, too, because, for all his potential, he lacked focus. He had been a history major in college, and a linguistics minor. On graduating, though, he concluded that, as rewarding as these fields had been, he was not really cut out to make a living at them. He decided that what he was really meant to do was study economics. And so, he applied to graduate school, and was accepted at the University of Wisconsin. And, after only a semester, he dropped out of the program. Not for him. So, history was out; linguistics, out; economics, out. What to do? This was a time of widespread political activism, and Ed became an aide to Senator George McGovern, then running for the presidency on an anti-war platform. He also wrote articles for political journals like the Nation and the New Republic. After some months, Ed realized that politics was not for him, because, in his words, it demanded qualities he did not have, foremost among them common sense. All right, then: history, linguistics, economics, politics, were all out as career choices. What to do? Ed suddenly realized that he was really suited to study mathematics. So he applied to graduate school, and was accepted at Princeton. I met him midway through his first year there--just after he had dropped out of the mathematics department. He realized, he said, that what he was really meant to do was study physics; he applied to the physics department, and was accepted.<p>I was happy for him. But I lamented all the false starts he had made, and how his career opportunities appeared to be passing him by. Many years later, in 1987, I was reading the New York Times magazine and saw a full-page picture akin to a mug shot, of a thin man with a large head staring out of thick glasses. It was Ed Witten! I was stunned. What was he doing in the Times magazine? Well, he was being profiled as the Einstein of his age, a pioneer of a revolution in physics called ""String Theory."" Colleagues at Harvard and Princeton, who marvelled at his use of bizarre mathematics to solve physics problems, claimed that his ideas, popularly called a ""theory of everything,"" might at last explain the origins and nature of the cosmos. Ed said modestly of his theories that it was really much easier to solve problems when you analyzed them in at least ten dimensions. Perhaps. Much clearer to me was an observation Ed made that appeared near the end of this article: every one of us has talent; the great challenge in life is finding an outlet to express it. I thought, he has truly earned the right to say that. And I realized that, for all my earlier concerns that he had squandered his time, in fact his entire career path--the ventures in history, linguistics, economics, politics, math, as well as physics--had been rewarding: a time of hard work, self-discovery, and new insight into his potential based on growing experience.""",1293401978

I've been a bash user for well over a decade, until recently when I switched back to zsh.<p>During my switch, I learned a few things.  First, it really wasn't particularly painful to switch all my personal scripts to zsh.  I guess I probably wasn't using that many bashisms, and the few I was using were easily convertible to zsh syntax.<p>Second, day to day use of zsh does not feel all that much different from bash, and it really takes very little time to get used to if you already know bash.  Of course, learning and getting comfortable with using some of the completely different zsh features will take time.  I'm learning them in small bites.<p>Third, despite bash's ubiquity, I now wish I'd just used zsh all along, as they're really not different enough to hamper the use of bash when you need to use it.<p>Fourth, (depending on what you want to do) getting in to the nitty-gritty of configuring zsh is not always easy.  zsh is thoroughly documented, but at the same time the documentation is not very user friendly, and there really aren't enough well-written introductory tutorials to quickly get you up to speed on doing more advanced things like writing your own completion widgets (or even editing existing ones, as they're so poorly commented).  So if you want to customize zsh's more advanced features, be prepared to spend a lot of time with the man pages and user's guide.<p>On the other hand, there are some really helpful people on freenode's #zsh channel.  With their help your transition to zsh should be pretty painless.<p>As to your particular concern about debugging existing bash scripts, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  The shells are really not so different in syntax that you'd be completely lost when you wanted to debug some bash script.  And if you do run in to problems with them, you could always ask for help on freenode's #bash.",1293401966

And I like to think I am (or, better, have the privilege to be) able to appreciate just a little bit of their complexity. Yes, repression is terrible. In our eyes. And, yes, it is <i>good</i> to try and change the view of other cultures to understand our own view. But showing someone they are wrong is very different from telling them they are wrong.<p>I believe as strongly as you that, for example, repression of women is terrible. But I wouldn't walk in guns blazing with that ideal, that is the way wars begin. Instead, bring the ideal to the right people and without the zealotry, take the long view. And with luck when we quit this world we will have set in motion serious change. It takes power and dominance we can never again see (and, in fact have fought to remove) to change the entire world in one generation. Some of our forefathers fucked it up big time; and though they ended up with the right result it was not by their planning; let's learn from those misfires.<p>And I strongly encourage you to travel to these countries, learn their language and customs.

This, although you perhaps do not realise it, is your strongest argument. The way it was won was drastic action which encouraged change within the ruling elite (let's not delude ourselves there is one in every country). But it was won over time, regardless of the approach taken. The ""problem"" with the internet is that results feed back instantly. Will China ever be democratic and similar to our country; my thinking - yeh probably. But it will take time, a lot of time. Which sucks for our generation in China, and I feel for them every day. Look at Russia, you could argue (quite rightly) that is <i>still</i> not ""fixed"". What are we doing about that? In 250 years I suspect things will be radically different.<p>All we can do is do our best for those alive today, and hope their descendants have it better.<p><i>The sentiment behind this is just utterly stupid. I suppose you'll follow up with a nice parable about how the railroads were built. People don't want to HAVE to work long and hard, especially unnecessarily. When you look at wealth distribution, it's apparent that the majority of people are getting fleeced.</i><p>I hate to say it but this shows a terrible misunderstanding of the Chinese culture and my argument.
