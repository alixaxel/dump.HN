I got my first personal app written to control my Denon 3808 remote.<p>Admittedly it would have taken me a fraction of the time in either C# or Java ... square bracket central is something that is hard to get used to.<p>However, I find the whole experience of developing on iOS very well documented ... this is not COM development with MFC, it is much more approachable. It is a pleasure to have a language that has its roots in Smalltalk and having a fairly comprehensive yet-not-gigantic set of support classes is great. Objective C delegates are nice, the evented style it offers is nice. Auto release pools take away a lot of the pain of memory management. I am sure that after a few months of development in Objective C I would be quite productive. However I still prefer C#. Also, I prefer Ruby over C#.<p>When I first learned WPF a few years ago I could not believe the bloat of the base library, it took weeks to really understand how all the XAML stuff works, building custom controls was tricky business.<p>Today, Silverlight (which has its roots in WPF) is much more polished. As far as I can see if you use the toolkit and controls that ship with WP7 development is quite seamless. However, my understanding is that the iOS set of APIs are more comprehensive due to the huge first to market advantage they have.<p>There are lots of very subtle advantages to each of these platforms that only and expert in all 3 could point out. That is an article I would love to read.",1293749616

2053830,comment,2052521,2053411,0,0,mkramlich,,,"I agree that dividends are a healthier and saner way to earn money from investments. The problem is that as a little guy I have no control over whether some company makes a dividend distribution, or even whether they make a profit or not. I <i>can</i> control whether I buy that stock in the first place, and control whether and when I sell that stock. Therefore to make money in this latter scenario, the stock price <i>must</i> change (usually up, but if you're shorting, down can work too) in order for me to make a profit. Thus it's in my best interests for a stock's price to fluctuate, regardless of whether that fluctuation has any relationship to the fundamental health or profitability of the company. It's weird. It's dumb. But that's the way it is.<p>And that's just the incentive for the little guy who's an outside investor. Imagine now you're a big guy with a lot of financial clout, and inside connections, especially as far inside as being on the board or one of the executives. You not only are incented to cause distortions to the stock price, regardless of merit, but you also have greater power over the ""upstream"" numbers (how to define profit, when to book profits/costs, etc.) and over the media presence and general public's perception of the company.

I use Spotify a fair bit, despite having a fairly crappy UI (not that it's too bad, just annoying in places), but there's no way in hell I'd pay for it unless at least one of the following things were true:<p>1) The premium version cost just £5 a month - The £10 it actually costs would cover a new album each month, which is a permanent asset worth more to me than being able to listen to their selection for a limited period. There is a £5 a month subscription, but it doesn't have mobile or offline mode, so it's near useless. Ironically, I might not feel that way if the premium option simply <i>didn't exist</i>, but putting them side-by-side looks like naked profiteering.<p>2) I could search for something and expect <i>at least</i> an 85% chance of finding it. The current 50%-ish is nowhere near good enough to pay that much for. I listen to a fair bit of European techno/rock/metal/industrial and those seem to be particularly weak areas. If you can have a conversation with a random person in a pub about a band, there's a good chance they have it I guess, but even then there are a lot of surprising gaps. For a random example, my last search was for something (anything) by Arcade Fire, but no joy.<p>As you say, it is technically very well designed - very responsive, and even without offline mode it buffers well enough that the frequent dropouts in my crappy ADSL connection haven't caused any problems I can recall. I just feel that it's overpriced for such a limited selection.",1293748977

2053814,comment,2052521,2053210,0,0,mkramlich,,,"I personally think ""double taxation"" does not exist.<p>Taxes/fees/whatever are taken out when money changes hands. Whether it moves from one individual to another, or between an individual and a company, or between two companies, etc. It doesn't matter. It's just ""single"" taxation. But there might be a series of them with N hops.<p>Consider this: consumer A pays out money to buy some good from company B. Out of that money, some is siphoned off in the form of sales taxes. The company gets the balance of that. Company pays some portion of their earnings in taxes. Company also pays some portion of their revenue to their employees. Out of the money paid by the company to their employee, some is taken out as tax. Employee gets the money. Out of that money, he uses some of it to buy some product. Out of that total purchase price he pays, some is taken out in sales taxes. And so on, and so on. Repeat with other sorts of transactions and money flows. Thus, there is no ""double taxation"" just taxation. If you argue there is double taxation, then, in reality, there is also triple taxation and quadruple taxation and infinity taxation.<p>Double taxation is code for ""I just don't like that particular tax and want it reduced or eliminated"". It is not a factually valid criticism in and of itself, by my reasoning.",1293748798

It involves political parties, speeches, elections, debates, making compromises with the opposing party, and finally resolution.<p>What we find over and over again is that when folks try to just use the courts and the legal system to implement change, it always results in a lot of friction. There are still people mad in the States about Roe v. Wade, and that was many decades ago.<p>So the way things change makes a difference. Perhaps the lawyers can browbeat the society into changing. I kind of doubt it -- especially for something this big.<p>Theoretically yes, anything is possible. We could easily live in a world where publishers charge many times for the same material based on all sorts of random factors like format, time of use, etc. But in reality I just don't see a change of the magnitude taking place without all of the political paraphernalia associated with such changes, no matter how many people they stick in jail or sue.<p>It's a shame, because just like in the net neutrality issue, the companies could have avoided this by using common sense in their licensing and distribution policies, instead of fixating on the letter of the law (which nobody cared about anyway until mp3s came along)<p>The minute my grandma can't treat an ebook like she did her old paperbacks the publishers have lost the game. It might be another hundred years (so it wouldn't matter to the publishers and probably be considered by them a ""win""), but the laws will eventually catch up to where the people are.<p>I imagine this will play out like pot legalization -- long and difficult, with a generation of politicians having to pass from the scene before the posturing stops and common sense takes hold.",1293747377

The lines would alternate between a green and white paper color. Along both the left and right edges were rows of holes, needed by the printer mechanism. The code itself was highly highly verbose plus was probably >50% comments, both inline and in section delimiting blocks. I later got into BASIC programming myself as my first language, then 6502 Assembly, then C.

They were hundreds of millions of dollars in the red. I can't speak to MOG's profitability (I don't have info for them), but I guess as someone who lives in the States where people get sued over music, I look at Spotify and then at competing services like MOG and just sort of shrug my shoulders over $5/mo to get unlimited music onto all of my devices.",1293746632
