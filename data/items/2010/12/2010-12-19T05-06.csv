2021222,comment,2020775,2020775,0,0,jonpaul,,,"I use both Ruby and C# daily. I love them both. My only complaints about Ruby and the Ruby ecosystem are these:<p>1) Minor versions of Ruby are incompatible with each other. 1.9.1 to 1.9.2 requires some code changes.<p>2) Developers of non-popular gems often lose interest and stop maintaining them.<p>3) WPF is truly a remarkable UI toolkit. I wish there was an equivalent.<p>What I love:<p>1) The Gem system makes moving your app from system to system trivial.<p>2) Most Ruby devs use Git/Github.<p>3) Ruby's expressiveness.<p>4) Metaprogramming.<p>If you use both languages, what are your opinions?",1292738307

2021214,comment,2020815,2021083,0,0,petercooper,,,"Interesting to know! (UPDATE: Looks like I'm wrong ;-) See last update.)<p>It seems this issue was raised in 2008 and a solution (of sorts) suggested: <a href=""https://rspec.lighthouseapp.com/projects/5645/tickets/504-warning-free-rspec-a-solution-for-useless-use-of-in-a-void-context-warnings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://rspec.lighthouseapp.com/projects/5645/tickets/504-wa...</a> .. David Chelimsky seemed to think Ruby 1.9 would lose this warning but it didn't and he reopened the ticket (and it's still open 2 years later) :-) The ""check"" workaround seems generic and viable, if noisy.<p>But I thought I'd see what actually happens when you try a super simple example with RSpec itself:<p><pre><code>  require 'rspec'

  describe ""a number"" do
    it ""should be equal to itself"" do
      1.should == 1
    end
  end
</code></pre>
Running with warnings gives some warnings in <i>diff-cls</i> (oops) but none for the <i>1.should == 1</i> - the mystery gets a little deeper (RSpec masking it somehow?).<p><i>UPDATE:</i> I think I found the reason after scouring RSpec 2.0's source. Based on your example but putting <i>should</i> in Kernel rather than Object:<p><pre><code>  module Kernel
    def should; self; end
  end

  def omg
    1.should == 1
  end

  omg
</code></pre>
You get no warning in this case. Curiously, though, if you ditch omg and just run the 1.should == 1 direct, you <i>still</i> get a warning. Confusinger and confusinger.<p><i>LAST UPDATE:</i> I'm leaving the above for completeness but it appears the result is not such a useful one (see tl's response ;-))",1292738056

What about when another runway is needed, and another after that? The best thing to do is to plan for the airport to take up an enormous amount of space beforehand, and probably, in this case, to build another airport. (NYC already has three, but I only know of two in London off the top of my head.)<p>* Roads and railways: I think this is the ""most difficult"" one to deal with. I think it helps to have a more accurate definition of property rights than what most people operate with, which is to say, it's only your property if you actually use it--otherwise nobody is impacting you if <i>they</i> use it, which is the whole point of property. For example, I don't think people should be allowed to ""own"" large, empty tracts of land. (This would be the common problem with building roads and railways in America.) And if you want to build new roads in a heavily urbanized area, I think that's just a bad idea... I mean, that's never really necessary, unless you want to <i>increase</i> the human density of that particular area (which it self is never really necessary). Also, there are options like building underground and building multi-story highways.<p>* Infrastructure: The examples you're giving (power plants, waste disposal) are just discrete ""points"" in the map that don't have to be physically in any one particular place, as long as they're in the general area. Surely someone in a large area will be willing to sell you a plot of land. (If not, just build the infrastructure further out.)<p>Your point about density of USA vs. UK is a good observation, though I don't think it really changes the principles.<p>A lot of times American libertarians (I'm not one, FYI) talk about limited government, and their opponents immediately say things like ""What about roads? Roads only work if the government builds them, and has eminent domain."" I personally don't agree with the latter point of view on roads - but, in general, I don't think it's really an argument worth having. There are more important things to argue about, such as defending property rights <i>in principle</i>. But for a principle to be valid, it has to always be valid. So when I argue about eminent domain, I do so to save property rights, not because I acutally think eminent domain is particularly important compared to so many bigger issues in our culture today.",1292735470
