We figured it was just that the GA was a bit overly proud of its accomplishment, and wasn't interested in improvement.  This is with random strings inside a main() wrapper with stdio, and nothing else.  I forget what their fitness function was, but I'm fairly certain it wasn't too simple, and I think that shot them in the foot near the end.<p>I still boggle at the attempt; I built a maze solver in Ruby that handled changing mazes by ant-trail-like solving (I forget the term...) that only took me a handful of hours.  Then I spent another 10 to make modifying the maze as simple as possible, and I made a dozen or so wildly different mazes with moving walls, transporters, etc while doing my presentation to demonstrate that it worked.  I think <i>that</i> may have won me more points than the functioning code; lots of people's barely worked, and nobody else had anything they could run in reasonable times during a presentation.",1292299018

2003008,comment,2001736,2002487,0,0,vorg,,,"> ""the only reason you would now use yacc is parsing speed""<p>Wikipedia says another advantage of LR parsing over LL is the error messages are more localized, and therefore relevant. I wonder whether derivatives in an LL parser (e.g. combinators) would help with that disadvantage?<p>If not, and because derivatives run quickly in practice for correct grammars, but approach theoretical exponential speed for random inputs, perhaps the best use for derivative grammars is giving realtime feedback when typing code into an IDE which enforces correct input and editing (e.g. always producing a corresponding correctly-placed close bracket in the code somewhere when the programmer types in the open bracket), and only allows previously entered source code to be edited within the IDE. Such a use would give decent parsing speed and no need for error messages, the very function parsing derivatives are good at (assuming this research is correct).",1292298046
