They fly the referrers out to expensive resorts a few times a year and in exchange the referrers give HF a heads up on all the cool people and projects they know about. The goal seems to be providing a framework for people who wouldn't otherwise do a startup. I can't leave my family, I need a salary, I'm just afraid, I'm not motivated enough.<p>Whereas YC and the US scene is all about entrepreneurship, Europe (in general--there are lots of great startups there but it's no SF Bay) has more trouble getting hackers to take the plunge. HF seems to take the approach that they'll take a huge equity stake in the idea rather than a specific company and then pay you for a year to develop it. It's not clear that you'd have to do a real startup, they might just get someone else to do that once you've built substantial IP. I think the goal is to basically bring all the people who MIGHT produce something of value into one place, pay them like employees, and be a European Google in the sense that they'll try lots of projects and the ones that succeed will pay for the others.<p>It's not a program I'd ever be interested in, but I'm not European or afraid of risks, and I applied to YC.  It may work really well in that culture, should be interesting to check back in a year or so to see how they're doing",1291218686

The law of the land up to some time before the famine prohibited the purchase of land by Catholics; only about 7% of the agricultural land was actually in the hands of the Irish. This meant the vast majority of them were serfs to English lords and had to rely on small/fragmented patches of land to feed themselves.
