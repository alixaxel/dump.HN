2033947,comment,2033738,2033738,0,0,btilly,,,"Interesting note.  Not only are government pensions officially in trouble, but they also assume that the return on investment for their pension funds are absurdly high, like an 8% annual return.  If we take the reported figures and substitute in the risk free rate of return (which is what economic theory says we should use) then the unfunded government pension liability isn't a half trillion, it is 2.5 trillion.  (See <a href=""http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/library/pension-crisis/public-employee-pensions/research-analysis-reports/unfunded-liabilities-state-and-local-government-employ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/library/pension-crisis/pu...</a> for those figures.)<p>Now how are they trying to address this problem?  Well many pension funds have been engaging in risky investments, hoping that they will generate the returns they need.  But if they fail, they've created a bigger problem.  Unfortunately for all of us, a large piece of that investment was private equity funds.  Much of which went into leveraged buy-outs that should start going south in a year or two.<p>For those who remember the history, private equity is what the junk bond kings of the 80s renamed themselves to.  Back then the Savings and Loans had a similar need for high returns and invested heavily in them.  The deals failed, and we had the S&L crisis.<p>Same story.

2033944,comment,2031675,2031675,0,0,fleitz,,,"Simple answer, to guarantee fuck you money.<p>Long answer, most startups will never be Facebook, Google or Twitter. Hence the economically rational founders believe it is better to hold cash than stock in the company. If the founders aren't rational economic actors then any reason will do. This is where passion, and emotion come into play. You will never sell because you aren't a rational economic actor. (It's ok, almost no one is)<p>You mention selling a compnay when it is not making a profit. Selling a company when it is not making a profit is a really good way to get a crap valuation, the point is to sell the company of the apex of belief in its future to produce profit. A company that is shown to have apex'd is not one that most people want to invest in. You're going to have to sell at that point to a 'corporate raider'.<p>Ideally, you want to sell when investors think the growth curve is going to keep on going but it has actually reached a plateau, and you are selling on a multiple of expected profit in the future.<p>Thats pretty much why startups sell.

While a person does have control over which religion he or she adheres to in practice, I don't think a person has conscious control over what he or she believes, and I think that that's a factor which needs more respect.<p>You can study more and educate yourself and find your opinions changing as you learn, and maybe there are beliefs that you hold which you only hold because you've never spent the time to analyse them. But the number of people who analyse their own beliefs is small, as is the number of people whose beliefs will change when they are proven incorrect or when the evidence supporting those beliefs (if there is any) is cast into doubt.

For example, the API might use OAuth after logging the user in with credentials, so this is a case where things are done differently in the two approaches.<p>In this case, does one simply write two ways of doing things? You might also not want to let the users do things with the api that they can do on the site, or give different permissions to the site versus the API. How do you handle these things?",1293092342

Nothing in its authorizing statute expressly permits it to impose the rules now known as net neutrality. Therefore, it sought to justify its ability to do so under the doctrine of so-called ""ancillary jurisdiction,"" meaning that it had an implied power to do so in aid of its expressly granted powers. Unfortunately, a definitive federal appeals court ruling held that no such ancillary jurisdiction existed, leaving the matter for Congress to decide. Rather than deferring to Congress, the FCC chose to adopt a new rationale for its assertion of this authority. Congress overwhelmingly balked at the idea of any broad assertion of such authority and, in the back and forth, the FCC came up with the toe-in-the water approach just adopted to the satisfaction of almost no one. Even this assertion of jurisdiction will certainly be challenged in the courts in cases that will take years to decide, leaving this whole issue in a pathetic state of uncertainty for all concerned.

2033874,comment,2032743,2033290,0,0,strlen,,,"Functional programming is not just about passing function pointers. In this case, C is functional. It's about expressing your code as series of function applications i.e., no mutable state, no side effects, no differences between statements and expressions (everything has a value). Very few languages are purely functional, so it's rather a sliding scale.<p>Nonetheless, functional programming is not the encourage common style in Python: there are no data structures available, many methods have side effects, it's hard to isolate mutable values from mutable. Not saying it's right or wrong, it's just different.<p>I should also note that Common Lisp isn't all that functional compared to other languages: I'd rate it being just slightly more functional than Ruby. The reason it appeals to some Lispers is due to simple syntax, data structure literals and dynamic typing. These features are common now, are useful for experimental programming (of the sort that frequently happens in AI and ML work) but they originated with Lisp. Lack of syntax, presence of macros and resulting ease of metalinguistic abstraction are not present in Python, but not every Lisp(er) used them: some preferred functional style (e.g., never using loop macro and using higher order functions and closures as means of abstraction), some preferred macros and DSLs, some stayed away from both.<p>Java bashing is healthy: while I personally don't mind Java, many developers were forced into writing Java (having previously worked in Smalltalk, Lisp, C++, Perl,  and others) as the language was heavily marketed to managers. Java hatred and bashing is thus a well understood reaction (although the culprit for verbosity are awfully horrid libraries such as Spring and J2EE: alternatives like Guice, for example, are much less verbose).  However, JVM is now home to Scala, a much stronger candidate for an OO/functional hybrid language than Python (that's not to say Python isn't an elegant and powerful language with many advantages, especially when it comes to tools/automation development).",1293091764

2033858,story,,,42,31,nav,"Awesome email advice from a friend on how to learn programming.",,"Let's start with the first and most important rule of learning to code. Read everything and understand what you're reading.<p>Do not skip or skim words or communication of any kind. Don't read something assuming you know what it means; if you don't understand it, look around, ask someone, or google until you understand what you've just read. Then, you can move on.<p>The reason for this is that programming involves comprehension, not knowledge (more on that below).<p>Failure to follow this will make you a sucky programmer. You'll write buggy code. You'll piss yourself off when you think nobody wants to help you. Then, you'll end up really pissed because everything you thought you knew how to do falls apart, and you finally realize you're a bad programmer. This happened to me about 7yrs ago -- so, I'm trying to save you the trouble. After I realized this, and, after I learned how to program, not only did I quickly become very good but everything was 10 times easier and I enjoyed programming far more than I did before. Bad programming is exciting -- good programming is a party.<p>First, I want to tell you that learning a programming language and learning how to program aren't the same thing. A very simple metaphor to this is driving. You can learn how to drive, but, driving an automatic transmission sports car is completely different than driving a manual 18-wheeler. They both move on wheels and function the same, but, are very, very different. Also, if you were getting started, it would be easier to learn with a small automatic car than an 18-wheeler.<p>Programming and driving, however, are very different. Whereas driving is a mechanical task, which uses one part of your brain, programming is comprehension. When you're programming, you're not the driver, you are the mechanical engineer who invented fuel injectors, or the chemical engineer who invented run-flat tires. A programmer uses comprehension to write logic which instructs machines to create something material and useful.<p>The key when learning to program is that you create; bad programmers only know how to drive while good programmers know how spark plugs work.<p>So, I will share with you several things:
1) IMPORTANT: What NOT to do and why
2) How you should go about learning to program
3) About Java, Microsoft, and Enterprise
4) Failure and Practice
5) About Hacker News<p>1) IMPORTANT: What not to do and why
Often, when we read sites, books, etc., we're interpreting what we're reading and creating a story (perception) or associating it with something we already know. No matter what you already know from previous experiences with computers, learning to program is new -- it's like learning how to write -- you know the letters, you've seen it all, but getting your hand to draw such concise letters, words, and sentences, is a completely new experience. This is how you should take in programming; coding should be elegant, concise, and flow. Programming isn't glueing things to form a collage or mocking what you've seen. Just as you can't pretend to speak in a foreign language, you should never write code unless you fundamentally know what it does.<p>There's a lot of crap out there. Rails, most of PHP, a lot of Java, and most of what Microsoft developers come up with are pieces of crap cobbled together to make something which <i>somehow</i> works. The problem is all the people who are SOOOOO excited and exuberant about their crap. Some things, like Rails, started out awesome and are crap now. Unfortunately, people forget that Rails is just a tool; instead, they use it as a crutch -- even though it's now very worn and rusty. Don't trust or use something just because it's popular -- chances are it sucks. By sucks, I mean, it bites you in the ass a lot and/or forces you to do stupid things which waste your time.<p>Which brings me to my next subject of Tools. There's a saying ""when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"". This is one of the many reasons you should learn a language FIRST and not do anything else first. Otherwise you will end up wondering why you're ""hammer"" isn't helping you with glue or screws. So, remember to use the right tool for the job.<p>Want to write iPhone apps? Learn Objective-C.
Want to write Android apps? Learn Java.
Want to use Rails? Learn Ruby.
Want to use Django? Learn Python.<p>But before you do all of this, learn one language first. The language I'm going to suggest you learn is Python, and there's a really good reason why.<p>The book I'll be referring you to is ""how to program"" and teaches with Python. As per the rule above, don't skip the introduction; read and do exactly what it tells you. I picked this book because it's excellent at teaching you how to program, and it's modern. The fact that it's free is just a perk. This is why I picked Python -- this book is awesome.<p>2) How you should go about learning to program
i) Start with Python. Learn Python by using this book: http://learnpythonthehardway.org/index
ii) Learn how to write a basic Objective-C or Java program
iii) If you learned obj-c, install the iPhone SDK, If Java install the Android SDK
iv) Write a mobile application
v) now, you're prepared to explore other languages, platforms, etc. (java, jquery, rails, databases)<p>Unless it's required (for classroom or work), don't touch anything else to do with writing code until v).<p>Regarding steps ii) and iii)
This of course, is the hard way, but that's a good thing! You can't use Python with the Android or iPhone SDK (Software Development Kit), AND you'll never be able to create a web application with them. However, the Android and iPhone SDKs don't suck and are VERY pragmatic (pragmatic is a good thing!). These SDKs make it easy for developers to create mobile applications -- this is an amazing thing because mobile phones have limitations which servers and desktops don't have. They have limited battery life, a slow network connection, less memory, and a slower graphics processor.<p>By learning how to develop on one of these platforms, you'll learn how to do something with requirements and limitations, and, you'll learn how to apply you're knowledge of programming to a new language. Best of all, you'll write something you can use on your phone, anywhere -- way better than a web site.<p>Once you can work through writing an android or iphone app (which isn't that difficult, trust me!), then anything to do with web applications will magically become a no-brainer for you.<p>3) About Java, Microsoft, and Enterprise
The way you're going to learn how to program is completely different than the world of Java, Microsoft, and enterprise systems. It's different because these worlds are built on ""information technology"" and not on productivity. They're built to provide solutions, not solve problems. As a result, everything in these worlds are convoluted, complex, or expensive. Learning to program without these technologies will equip you if you ever need to work with them. In which case, you will better at understanding how the IT components in Enterprise are separate from the programming components. In short, you'll be able to see the forest from the trees whereas others do not. Most just get lost and try to find a corner they can hide in.<p>4) Failure and Practice
Programming is trial and error. You have to LEARN. Last, if you don't have good comprehension skills, it might not be for you. That doesn't mean you can't learn how to program well or be productive, but, you may have to work harder and might not enjoy it as much -- it could take some time for your comprehension to get up to par. This of course, is what practice is for (which is also covered in the book).<p>5) About Hacker News - http://news.ycombinator.com
If you want to program and develop software you should follow Hacker News. It's kind of addictive so be moderate. Hacker News has become a sort of ""pay it forward"" community where it's discouraged to put people down and you should always try to make positive contributions.",1293091262
