1996272,comment,1995708,1995708,0,0,CountHackulus,,,"I work in compiler development, and have worked on a C/C++ compiler. Let me first say that these side by side comparisons are excellent for pointing out the weakpoints in compilers, and showing where extra optimizations could be made, they are, as presented in this article, not very useful.<p>When's the last time you saw a program that was just a single function? In real production environments, you're going to be running programs with hundreds of modules, thousands of functions, and millions of instructions. Optimizations like inlining, partial inlining, partial redundancy elimination, and inter-procedural analysis become much more important.<p>When you're a compiler developer looking for more performance, the typical process starts with profiling an important benchmark (like SPEC2006) and looking at where the program is spending most of its time. Then you take a look at the offending code and see if it can be distilled down to one of these microbenchmarks. There you can decide how best to optimize this. Without this context though, these type of microbenchmarks are nearly pointless. They show some optimization that could be done, but who knows if it'll be worth it, or even make any sort of impact on the final performance of a production workload.",1292122459

1996253,comment,1995525,1995599,0,0,nickpinkston,,,"1.) I agree with your argument that a free market with some govt intervention is the proper system for solving such market inefficiencies (i.e. coordination problems amongst infrastructure providers who have different interests than the general public in emergencies).<p>However, it's not a binary decision between the Wild West and nationalization. The scale goes from:<p>* Standards (""Here's the minimum."" - building codes)\n* Checks (""Ask us if it's okay."" - gun background checks)\n* Certification (""Tell us, and we'll make you more legit."" -  LEED [non gov't I know])\n* Licensure (""You must tell us."" - Liquor License)\n* Incentives (""Do this and we'll help you."" - Tax Credits)\n* Nationalization (""Only we can do it."" - Post Office)<p>You gain coordination of public interests and lose long-term innovation as you go down the list. Looking at how many disasters are handled with WalMart, Home Depot, FedEx having better response times - due to their economic incentives.<p>I'd propose solving this market inefficiency via standards, certification, and perhaps incentives - primarily because this will align incentives without the government needing to know the business and without the moral hazards politicians controlling companies brings. Think of building codes: builder's incentives now are ""build cheap, but safe"" - not just ""build cheap"" like 100 years ago.<p>2.) Most people can see that constitution has been largely deprecated and is more of a talking point than real power restriction. It doesn't mean we don't keep fighting for the new laws to be defined as open as possible (as you mention).<p>3.) Very true, but this doesn't automatically mean they should nationalize. There are lesser powers that will accomplish the same goal and more efficiently.",1292121636

If the demand is inelastic, the restaurants can raise prices to cover the tax. If demand is elastic, they can't.<p>What that suggests is OpenTable helps the restaurants that are oversubscribed with reservations all the time, since they can pass along costs, and it helps them manage things more efficiently, keep tables filled, send email reminders so people remember to cancel. Also if you're Internet savvy there are good marketing opportunities. It probably doesn't help the others much. So they feel they are being dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century and saddled with a cost and something they have a hard time using and complain about it.<p>This seems awfully like a startup seeing a need and filling it. It's hard to see evidence of a nefarious monopoly and market failure, unlike Ticketmaster which locks everyone in with anticompetitive agreements.

However, consider: Logically, ""you're telling people what they want to hear"" has no relationship to the merits of what's being told. What people want to hear might be false, or it might be true. For example, if I told my mother ""your son loves you very much,"" it's true that I'd be telling her what she wants to hear; I'd also be telling the truth. On the contrary, if I told that to Rashida Jones, it might be what she wants to hear, but it wouldn't be the truth.<p>I might also add that a lot of what Paul Graham writes could be classified as ""telling smart hackers what they want to hear."" After all, the message is: you can get rich and be respected, yes, you; there are few downsides to trying and massive upside, and you need never toil for a big, slow company with a big, slow boss. That's all very much what smart hackers want to hear. But it's also, I think, totally true.<p>It's wise to be skeptical of advice that conforms to the hopes of its audience. But it's equally wise to be skeptical of advice that doesn't so conform. What people want and what happens to be true don't bear any necessary relationship. If what Tim Ferriss is selling are books full of untrue things, then that's a fair criticism; but it's the only criticism that really makes any sense. And it's not one that I tend to hear.

To put that in perspective, consider that the average profit margin, before taxes, for a U.S. restaurant is roughly 5%. This means that a table of 4 spending $200 on dinner would generate a $10 profit. In this example, all of that profit would then go to OpenTable fees for having delivered the reservation, leaving the restaurant with nothing other than the hope that that customer would come back (and hopefully book by telephone the next time).''<p><a href=""http://incanto.biz/2010/10/22/is-opentable-worth-it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://incanto.biz/2010/10/22/is-opentable-worth-it/</a>",1292119657

The culture is different and absolute clarity is preferred over terseness.<p>There's a lot of infrastructure behind MapReduce and I bet you any implementation is going to have a lot more code in it than what is in Data.List.<p>Once things are in RAM (say, less than 1 GB), quicksort is the fastest algorithm (Edit: or some other optimized in-place variation on the theme such as introsort). You can parallelize across cores all you want but all that is going to do is crap up your caches and cause bus contention, making your code more complex and slower. The bottleneck is your databus not the CPU, after all what is the cost of a compare in clock cycles? This is also why mergesort is slower and parallelizing is not going to fix it.<p>If you want to see things that are parallelizable check out vectorizing libraries such as Thrust that run on massively parallel GPGPUs that have the bus design and RAM to handle that kind of parallelization. They are written in C++ and both the implementation and the code to use them looks almost the same like the code I posted. The compiler technology of other languages is years behind and currently can't even target these kinds of architectures.<p>I've seen GPU massive parallelization in Haskell and all it did was to generate C code and then invoke the CUDA compiler. This was in a research paper. In the meantime you can fire up nvcc with Thrust and sort bazillion of keys with less than 10 lines of code in C++ using a well-tested library.<p>Edit: BTW, anyone (and I really don't know who would be doing this) who is even <i>thinking</i> of running a MapReduce Haskell cluster must have lots of free time and $$$ to burn on wasted CPU cycles.",1292119297
