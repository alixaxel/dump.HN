1996362,comment,1995361,1995361,0,0,WillyF,,,"I didn't particularly like the way this article covered the topic, but it's probably just sour grapes because I wasn't included in it. I did exactly what they're talking about, so here's my story on how it happened and how long it has taken to actually be a suitable replacement for a job.<p>I graduated in December '05 (a semester early) from an Ivy League school with a degree in Industrial and Labor Relations. I had interned in HR for two summers with a company that I was really excited about. Because of relationships I developed there, I had multiple job offers, even though I didn't go through the on campus recruiting process. Fortunately, during my internships, I realized that HR wasn't for me (I'm sure the HN community can understand that). After committing most of my college years towards pursing a career in HR, I felt a little lost when I decided that I wanted to something—anything—else. I felt a pull towards entrepreneurship, but I didn't even know the startup world existed when I graduated.<p>So, I took a contract job for a few months while I stayed on campus for the Spring semester. Then I moved back in with my parents and took some time off to ""think."" And some more time off. And then a little more. (I also had a girlfriend who was still in school, which played a part in my unwillingness to commit to a job. We're still together, so I'm happy with my decision to ) When I finally started searching for a job, I realized that I didn't really want one. I wanted to be an entrepreneur, but I had no idea, no experience, and no clue of what was possible. So I looked for jobs that might prepare me for entrepreneurship in the future.<p>From December of '06 to May of '07 I committed myself to searching for jobs, while I also spent time learning about industries that interested me. I landed a decent number of interviews, but nobody wanted to hire me. I think that they could smell my bad attitude, and they also figured that someone with a résumé as good as mine but still on the job market after a year must have something seriously wrong with him. I was in a rut, my girlfriend and parents were losing patience with me, and I was extremely unhappy. I just wanted to be a productive part of society.<p>I had wasted most of what I had going for me when I graduated, so I decided that the only way that I could ""get it back"" was to start my own business. Luckily, by May of '07 I had been job searching long enough to know how broken the job search process is for grads who didn't have a clear idea of what career path they wanted to pursue.<p>After learning about Woot.com, I came up with the idea of one job a day, and I took things from there. I learned everything that I could about online recruitment, and I started building my site and my business. I had built websites in the past, but I pretty much had to start over. My parents were still supporting me to some extent, but I decided that I'd only use my own savings. The idea of taking money from someone else to start my business seemed ridiculous to me.<p>Oddly enough, I landed an interview with a startup in the job search space just as I was starting my company. I was surprised to learn that CEO would be interviewing me, and he didn't seem to like it when I told him that I was in the process of building a startup in the same space. (I needed to tell him something about how I spent the previous year.) He kind of got angry at me, and I obviously didn't get the job. Three and a half years later, his company's ad platform is one of my main revenue sources.<p>So, I started One Day, One Job - <a href=""http://www.onedayonejob.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.onedayonejob.com</a> - in late May of '07 and launched it in November of '07. I had to bail on the idea of selling daily job postings, and I instead decided to write about them from an editorial standpoint. It was the only way that I could build an audience without selling aggressively with nothing to sell.<p>After two years the company was ""profitable."" Three and half years in, I'm finally making enough money to cover all of my personal expenses. If things keep up, next year should be great. I get calls from VCs occasionally, and I've had multiple acquisition offers. More importantly, I've reached hundreds of thousands of college students and helped quite a few of them do what I couldn't—land an exciting job straight out of college.<p>I made a lot of friends who were doing the same thing along the way. Most of them failed and eventually used their experience to land a full-time job. I stuck things out, and it's finally starting to pay off. I couldn't have done it without a supportive girlfriend and family—I guess they're my ""investors.""<p>To make a long story short, I'm a graduate who made his own job. The added twist is that my job is helping other people with their job search. Maybe that makes me like the people who make money teaching people how to make money. I often get called a ""job search expert,"" but I'm really just an entrepreneur who uses the lessons he's learned from starting a business to teach job seekers how to improve their approach.<p>I wouldn't say that creating your own job is as much of a trend as the Times makes it out to be, but there are people like me who have made it work. Missing out on a salary for 3 years is really hard, even if you know deep down that the equity you're building is valuable. The quickest return on investment is in the form of experience. Even after a year of running my business, I knew that if I quit I could have jumped into much better job opportunities than I could have right after I graduated.<p>I'd certainly recommend creating your own job to any graduate who isn't happy with his or her options, but I'd also make it clear that it can take a long time to make it work—and for many it never does.",1292125741

1996349,comment,1995525,1995599,0,0,gojomo,,,"I prefer the 'shadow' authority of presidential suasion. In a crisis, the President makes reasonable requests, and infrastructure operators will cooperate with authorities and collaborate with each other, out of common interest and reasonableness.<p>But, as the crisis passes, operators then have the freedom to adjust their cooperation, without a permanent obligation that could be abused. That's flexible and includes natural checks on abuse in the diversity of citizens' opinions and decentralization of decisionmaking.<p>No explicit language can achieve the same broad flexibility; when it tries through vagueness, it opens the door to both abuse and paranoia. And it encourages clumsy ass-covering overbroad orders from overreaching politicians, given in a dictatorial spirit, rather than considered requests offered in a spirit of community coordination.<p>In practice it may also be better for the government to exceed its proper bounds temporarily in emergencies, then be snapped back by calmer minds shortly thereafter, than to enshrine in law the maximal authority that might ever be needed. Lincoln, Wilson, FDR, and Bush-43 <i>all</i> overstepped their legal or constitutional authority in wartime, and then pulled back (or were pushed back) by the courts and public opinion later. Preauthorizing what they actually did would have made it harder in each situation to return to normalcy afterward.",1292125434

A third-party, back-end agnostic reservation portal would be better for everyone. The best portal would win, and the best reservation management system with the lowest prices would win. It is a market failure, though it will probably resolve itself eventually.",1292124395

1996315,comment,1994998,1995402,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"What a great comment (Thanks Sizzla) Lots of wisdom in it. I agree with most of what sizzla says, especially<p>""You're looking at a year or two of full-time college-like preparation during which you will learn lots of math but little to no ML. Only then can you begin to really learn ML.""<p>(In my experience) This is completely true. I would go so far as to say ML <i>is</i> applied math.  It took me more time than a year, but it could be done in a shorter period of time by someone doing it full time/ someone brighter than me.<p>""The books by themselves are simply not enough to learn this stuff. One needs to literally go through as many lectures as possible in the relevant coursework online, and do the labs. ""<p>This is also true. Thankfully most of this(courework/lecture/papers) is online and  (most) professors are glad to answer (well structured, focussed) questions by email. If you are saying this is not as good as doing a PhD in say, CMU, full time I will be the first to agree. If you are saying it can't be done at all outside a formal PhD program I will have to respectfully disagree.<p>""Truly understanding anything written by Bishop or even going through ESL completely is something that is going to take an enormous amount of time (on your own easily a year, if you have the background) and mathematical skills that are typically way outside of what a Software Engineer deals with in any of the projects.""<p>This is true too :-). Most software engineers shouldn't try.  The time commitment required is enormous and the whole idea of my rant was to try to discourage people from taking shortcuts like ""being mentored"".<p>That said, perhaps where we disagree is the idea that something taking a large amount of time is a <i>bad</i> thing or that such understanding can <i>only</i> come with formal education. The difference in our opinions may boil down to or opinions about ""you can't do this on your own"".<p>""I definitely found several moderately complex projects with an ML ""flavor."" And that's already way better than most people who try to get into this by themselves and shows Ravi picked up on a bunch of stuff.""<p>Thanks,  but (a) I don't write much about the work I do on my blog or elsewhere except in the most general terms (for many reasons I won't go into  here). Judging the quality of my (paid for) work  by referring to my very infrequent blog articles/website is a little naive.  (b) More importantly I made no claims to be a professional  ML  <i>researcher</i>, who should be approached by people who are or want to be fulltime researchers.<p>I am ""just a programmer"" working on ML projects. My output (that I trade for money so I can put bread on the table)  is code , not research. I don't try to hide that or give a false impression of being a professional researcher.<p>At <i>best</i> I am an amateur dabbler in the research bits of ML, just like some people dabble in astronomy without being professional astronomers. It is just something I like to fiddle with, so please don't take me seriously.<p>""In the spirit of the blog-post's advice I was trying to gauge whether to take the author's advice seriously, but after some short searching I could not come up with publications in ML.""<p>You could not come up with publications because I don't have any!. And <i>you</i> should not take my ""advice"" ( I was just ranting, not really giving advice!)  at all :-).<p>That post was written for people who write to me asking for mentorship and so on, who presumable have made the (wrong!) decision to ask me for advice. It was not written for serious researchers trying to gauge whether they should take me seriously . You shouldn't, for the simple reason I am not a researcher, just a  programmer doing ML work!<p>My initial goal was to do interesting projects/get away from the enterprise outsourcing world. That is fairly hard to do in India but that is now done and sustainable.<p>What I do <i>now</i> is convert research results (from professional researchers)  into well engineered systems. <i>To do this</i> I need to able to consume research, not generate it. So yes, you are <i>completely</i> (utterly, unequivocally) right when you say I don't have any publications/research credentials  and should <i>not</i> be treated as an ML researcher.<p>At some point, I think I will try to  publish. It is a decent challenge for someone like me with no formal education in  math or CS. I like challenges.(Tangentially  a <i>lot</i> of published material is rehashed minor incremental stuff, with  irreproducible results and no proofs. The really good papers are somewhat rarer.)<p>All I'll say for wrt publishing now is ""Watch this space"". Publication is on my agenda. Not a very high priority but it <i>is</i> a goal. People tell me it can't (in practice) be done except in a formal PhD(ish) program. I might even do a formal PhD one of these days  - I like the idea of working with smart people - but meanwhile I am not going to wait around to be ""given permission"" to learn/do things.If at some point I have some published papers so I an be taken ""seriously"" by others, that is great. If I don't, that is great too. Life is too short to go around satisfying other people's expectations.<p>I've never listened to people who say I can't do this or that because I was too old/too young/too uneducated/born in the wrong place/living in the wrong place/don't have the right educational background/whatever.<p>If I can't bypass an entrenched system or pick the locks of doors slammed in my face, then what kind of hacker am I? We'll see someday if people can get published outside the formal ""system"". I am not daunted by the prospect.  And if I do get published, I will post here on HN.<p>""I'd also take a risk and say that traditional mentor/student relationships in India are quite different from the less formal ones in the West. My experience with colleagues from India is that they are much more likely to observe the authority ladder.""<p>This is <i>very</i> true so you are not taking a risk at all by saying so. I've been reprimanded before for ""thinking like  a Westerner"",""not respecting hierarchy"", ""not having asense of patriotism or nationalism"" (!),   and ""treating superiors as peers"" (all actual quotes).<p>There are <i>some</i> really good profs here who treat their students like colleagues and one of them recently reached out to me with an offer of doing joint research in an interesting area. So maybe I'll end up being professional researcher after all. I am trying to work out the logistics now. Wish me luck.<p>(PS: I am completely embarrassed that a rant I dashed off in twenty minutes or so is getting so much attention on HN, Blush! Run away and hide!)",1292124285

The second vendor did just that, took time to show me their value and that is why I chose them. You learn a lot of valuable information about people in negotiations and that was really the point I was trying to drive home, that some times people don't negotiate just to get the best price. Sometimes they see it as a path to insightful information. It's the reason I always negotiate.

He does it as a way of rationalizing reducing his tip, he is very cheap and he is a multimillionaire. After several occasions I refused to eat dinner with him, unless I paid and covered tip. He is disconnected from the fact that not everyone has buckets of cash and that that money is a lot more valuable to someone on waiter wages than his principals should be to him.

And throughout, you're bullied into docility and submissiveness. Even modern liberal refinements don't really help. So you're called an underachiever instead of a dummy.
