Get a compass and <i>look</i> at it. That will tell you. A flux meter will tell you all you will ever need to know about the magnetic fields around you.<p>Our eyes and ears are high bandwidth and using custom made sensors that output images and sounds that we can interpret we can enter a very large amount of information about our environment without so much as a drop of blood.<p>To literally have a 6th or 7th sense is very interesting but it really is just another low bandwidth channel that can easily be simulated using some tech and our existing sensors.",1293764367

Even with a fast computer and gsl/rb-gsl it still takes 10+ hours with my 1,000+ posts. Anyways, having a super fast site is going to be a breath of fresh air.

I can't even keep up on the libraries people are creating <i>around</i> Clojure, much less the pressure the core must be under.<p>It's hard to do both new dev + maintenance on any big project, much less a language so many of us feel personally invested in.  Looking back to this time last year, there is a lot more infrastructure in place and on the way that builds a base for managed growth.  I'm hopeful that once process stuff gets smoother it will be easier to streamline and offload some of that work.  If Linus can do it, Rich can do it too.<p>The patches I've contributed to core have gone in (or been bounced) appropriately in reasonable time frames.

Computers are not 'better' at chess than humans, they are simply faster and have access to more and more perfect forms of memory.<p>Humans learn a few simple rules and combine that with a motivation to win and suddenly 'know how to play chess' with some ability after a few hours, days or weeks. To become a master at the game takes a lot more study but in general people can learn how to play chess with some ease.<p>You are the one who is taking it seriously! Games are meant to be enjoyed, not to be taken too serious and even the big 'names' from chess play the game as a way to pit their wits against others. The way they arrive at their solutions is totally unrelated to the way computers arrive at theirs.<p>Imagine if you showed up to a chess contest armed with a veritable library of chess books, a history of all the grand master games ever played, their openings and evaluation of the mid games that came out of those openings and a near infinite number of assistants that are willing to play your current board position through large number of variations to see the possible outcomes of potential moves.<p>I think the key to continued enjoyment in spite of the fact that computers are 'better' at this is that they indeed arrive by a way that between humans would be considered cheating.<p>Be impressed by how much resistance our humble brains can put up in the face of such an onslaught and realize that we are the ones that are 'better' at it because no computer that ever got 'taught' chess was any good at all. It takes the combined elements of vast pre-programmed storage and brute force to make it to the higher classes in chess and that has nothing to do with 'playing chess'.",1293762377
