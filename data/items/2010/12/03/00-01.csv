The economic impact is far more complex than the simplistic analysis that you have presented.<p>The Social Security Administration also projects that the situation will stabilize. They suggest that, instead of complete Social Security reform, the payroll tax simply go through a graduated increase ending in 2081. Krugman's main criticism with this math is that GDP growth projections are needlessly pessimistic, meaning that the revenue projections are also pessimistic.<p>Either way, he is not arguing against all change to Social Security, he is arguing against the loudest voices that are constantly screaming that Social Security is a giant disaster that will tear the govt down in flames.<p>When I asked for context I wasn't asking for what the CBO is, I was asking for what the economic assumptions (of which there must be many) the CBO made. I was also asking for the context of the outlay in respect to the rest of the government debt and budget.",1291337965

I agree that one should use a library that lets someone else deal with the inevitable bullshit of browser compatibility. The question is then, ""what language should I use""? I used GWT for example, since I know Java, and I assume there are people who will find noloh easy to pick up because they already know the language. However, javascript <i>is</i> a high level language, so references to assembly and C are straw men. Noloh and GWT add yet another layer of abstraction on top of an already complex system.

I was a huge Gran Turismo fan and thought GT2 was the paragon of what was really possible with the hardware at that time. But it all went downhill starting from GT3. The reason, I suspect, is that the makers of GT were too caught up in its own ""The Real Driving Simulator"" spiel. Specifically: the gamer has to take part in an actual 24 hour endurance race, similar to the 24 Hour Le Mans. Games are supposed to be fun, first and foremost. Going around the same circuit for 24 hours at a stretch is not only bad for the gamer's health, it's also bad for the environment (since you can't turn off the console and have to leave the game paused should you have other matters to attend to). It makes absolutely no sense since the game does not simulate the other aspects of actual endurance racing e.g. team strategy, unexpected mechanical failure etc.<p>Like you, I tried Forza and haven't looked back. Sure, there are far more realistic driving sims on Windows, but FM is really easy to get into and it is FUN. Which is what gaming is all about.",1291336611

1964310,comment,1962846,1963974,0,0,Archaeum,,,"I guess I tend towards thinking of astrobiology as the subset of biology dealing with life beyond Earth--a convenient and arbitrary definition, perhaps. In any case, under this definition, with no validated extraterrestrial life, astrobiology would be a largely theoretical science or a line of philosophical inquiry. But if that's too narrow an interpretation, maybe this indeed is an example of experimental astrobiology. Hence, I may have overstated my position when I said this is not astrobiology.<p>At this point, however, I fear I'm drawn towards philosophical digression. It seems the motivation of the scientist comes into play because she could end up with the same results whether she is a) looking for insight into how life could exist elsewhere in the universe or b) studying life in extreme conditions on Earth. The impetus and interpretation become the categorizers (in practice, I don't think it's too cynical to link this to funding source). On the broader question, I should perhaps defer to the epistemologists--does the nature of knowledge change depending on why it was sought or what is made of it?<p>Back to the question, what would I consider astrobiology? Well, if life or its precursors were found on Mars or a comet, that might work for me. But what happens when it falls to Earth? I don't know; I've never been particularly comfortable with the blurry divisions between disciplines anyway, so if I consider the dividing line between, for example, psychology and sociology to be tenuous, how am I supposed to feel in this instance? The thing is, knowing what to call it doesn't really affect our ability to understand or use it, it just changes the way we talk about it--which may be important, I grant. But this brings me back to the communication aspect. And as far as that goes, I feel like I've gone through a lot of words without saying much. Therefore, let me summarize like so: I understand why they call this astrobiology; I probably wouldn't call it that myself; most importantly, I think many people will be expecting something else.",1291336479

Then I research it and discover that it simply can't be done.  Easy to learn, but unusable.<p>Android, on the other hand, trades discoverability for usability.  I have heard that some Android users don't even know that they can pull down the notification bar.  But once you learn to do that, it's a wonderfully usable system.  (Same for long-press.  What to do something with a thing you see?  Press and hold.  Works every time, but not something you would necessarily think to do.)<p>I think when people say ""Android is unusable"" they really mean, ""Apple's icons are prettier"", which is absolutely true.  iOS devices look stunning on billboards and on TV.  Android devices?  Meh.  (I blame the tastelessness of the carriers, though.  A big fucking robot eyeball as the background?  NASCAR and Sprint logos all over the place?  Fuck off and die.  AOSP is nice looking, though.)<p>(Want to see the biggest software disaster ever in the history of humanity?  The Nook Color with Android.

Examples: you can select text and choose ""copy"", but they removed ""paste"" from the long-tap menu on text fields.  You can copy, but not paste.  They also made their own ""buttons"" that work like Android's; Back (which is an undiscoverable gesture, not a button), Menu, Home.  But sometimes, you also get the normal Android buttons.

I'd never hack from a restaurant table. My wife would rather me not be there than be hiding behind a laptop.<p>Plus, it shouldn't happen that often. If you're canceling plans and ignoring your SO on a frequent basis, then <i>you're doing it wrong</i> or you simply shouldn't be in a relationship.<p><i>""One of the best ways to combat this is to get involved yourself.

They've been hard at work on all of this ever since.  It's part of a clear detailed long-term vision and they've just been putting the finishing touches on it and everyone acts like it just happened all by itself.<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Between-Two-Ages-Americas-Technetronic/dp/0313234981"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Between-Two-Ages-Americas-Technetronic...</a><p>>""The technetronic era involves the gradual appearance of a more controlled society. Such a society would be dominated by an elite, unrestrained by traditional values. Soon it will be possible to assert almost continuous surveillance over every citizen and maintain up-to-date complete files containing even the most personal information about the citizen. These files will be subject to instantaneous retrieval by the authorities."" (This was an excellent prediction although it is slightly worse now.)<p>>'In the technotronic society the trend would seem to be towards the aggregation of the individual support of millions of uncoordinated citizens, easily within the reach of magnetic and attractive personalities effectively exploiting the latest communications techniques to manipulate emotions and control reason.""

[Whose] ties cut across national boundaries ...It is likely that before long the social elites of most of the more advanced countries will be highly internationalist or globalist in spirit and outlook ... The nation-state is gradually yielding its sovereignty... Further progress will require greater American sacrifices. More intensive efforts to shape a new world monetary structure will have to be undertaken, with some consequent risk to the present relatively favorable American position.""",1291334624

""me"". She did mention she worked with a team, but the ""I""'s were more abundant than the ""We""'s. I also caught a ""myself and my team"" instead of ""my team and myself"". She also talked a bit too much about herself.<p>I understand that she was the leading scientist and the one who had the idea, but still, I don't think you are supposed to act like that as a scientist, it makes you look bad. Besides, she also seemed to kind of take it personal that the chemist wasn't entirely convinced yet. Oh and she also looked a bit frustrated when the journalist asked over the phone line a question that made it look as though it was discovered by chance.",1291334617

If we can't afford to put air marshals on every flight, that's a weakness.

That may be true, but I'd like to see some evidence.
