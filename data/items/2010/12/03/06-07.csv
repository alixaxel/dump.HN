1965032,comment,1956497,1964811,0,0,okmjuhb,,,"The argument ""well, passing by reference gets compiled to passing a pointer by value so really there is no passing by reference"" is silly because passing by reference is a description of language semantics and function call evaluation. Your argument applies just as well to the statements ""there is no such thing as lambda functions"" or ""there is no such thing as garbage collection"" because those language features also get converted into representations that don't have either of them present.<p>The Java code you give isn't an example of passing by reference because, while you can change the value that x points to in Java, you can't change x to point to something different. No java function can change its arguments; the example you gave has the java function changing something that its argument points to.<p>Your argument that Java people can call language features the same name as distinct language features is: a. dumb, because it's just ""words mean whatever anyone wants them to mean"", and b. doesn't come anywhere close to applying here; the quotation at the end of my last response: ""there is exactly one parameter passing mode in Java - pass by value"" is a direct quote from 'The Java Programming Language'. <i>The authors of Java disagree with you</i>.<p>More from them:\n""All parameters to methods are passed 'by value'. In other words, values of parameter variables in a method are copies of the values the invoker specified as arguments. If you pass a double to a method, its parameter is a copy of whatever value was being passed as an argument, and the method can change its parameter's value without affecting values in the code that invoked the method.<p>...<p>You should note that when the parameter is an object reference, it is the object reference - not the object itself - that is passed ""by value."" Thus, you can change which object a parameter refers to inside the method without affecting the reference that was passed. But if you change any fields of the object or invoke methods that change the object's state, the object is changed for every part of the program that holds a reference to it.<p>...<p>Some people will say incorrectly that objects are passed ""by reference."" In programming language design, the term pass by reference properly means that when an argument is passed to a function, the invoked function gets a reference to the original value, not a copy of its value. If the function modifies its parameter, the value in the calling code will be changed because the argument and parameter use the same slot in memory.<p>...<p>The Java programming language does not pass objects by reference; it passes object references by value. Because two copies of the same reference refer to the same actual object, changes made through one reference variable are visible through the other. There is exactly one parameter passing mode - pass-by-value - and that helps keep things simple.""<p>Your last few paragraphs are beside the point; the question is not about which languages offer which levels of abstraction; the point is that different abstractions have different names and Java doesn't offer the abstraction named ""pass by reference"".",1291359079

But there is a big difference between something floating around as a rumor (or conspiracy theory) and having it confirmed in a diplomatic cable.<p>Take, for example, the cable about nuclear weapons in the Netherlands. We always suspected those were there, but neither or government or the US government confirmed it. A lot of Dutch citizens are rightfully enraged now, we deserve to be told those things. \nWe had to help the US find those WMDs in Iraq in their 'war for freedom', but it seems we're sitting on WMDs ourselves without knowing it.

If you don't know what it means and you pick up books about Smalltalk or CLOS, you won't really have a good grasp on the corporate C++/Java/C# environments you might be thrown into, and if you get a job interview that asks ""explain OOP to me"", they won't have any fucking idea what you're talking about, because by ""OOP"" they mean Java and by ""OOP"" you'll mean Smalltalk or CLOS. Likewise, if you pick up a Java book, it'll take you awhile to figure out what Smalltalkers, Lispers, and Rubyists are on about.<p>Unfortunately, the C++/Java conception of OOP has had a much better sales team since the 90's or so, so you can get sucked into that universe and never find your way out again.
