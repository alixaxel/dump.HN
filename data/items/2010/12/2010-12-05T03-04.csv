     I think you need to get over yourself.<p>When you say the types of things you say, and behave the way you do, the internet will react in a very predictable fashion.<p>It's nothing personal. It's a reality that I think you need to accept, and it's clear that you haven't because you still say things like 'keep hating on me...I love it'.<p>You don't. You are just saying that.<p>Saying things like that, makes you look like the kid on the playground that bullies everybody and when one day he gets kicked in the balls pretends like it doesn't hurt and goes above and beyond to show that it didn't hurt, but goes behind the locker and cries.<p>Not cool.",1291521504

What if someone's domain is totally abandoned?

1970986,comment,1970743,1970977,0,0,jrockway,,,"Exactly.  Remember when file-sharing first became popular?  Everyone used Napster, which had one centralized indexing server.  If someone wanted content removed, they could just ask Napster and it would be gone.<p>This wasn't good enough for the RIAA, which shut Napster down completely.  This caused the programming community to come up with an un-blockable alternative, and now everyone uses un-blockable encrypted BiTorrent with DHT.  If you want something gone, there is nothing you can do short of shutting down the entire Internet.<p>(It wasn't un-blockable initially, but some greedy ISPs tried to block it, so now it's encrypted UDP instead of cleartext TCP.  Now the ISPs can't block it reliably, and they waste their own bandwidth because UDP has no concept of a window size.)<p>So oops... now it's super-easy for people to distribute child porn, all because the music industry got greedy.",1291521276

The re module's ( <a href=""http://erldocs.com/R14B/stdlib/re.html?i=0&search=re"" rel=""nofollow"">http://erldocs.com/R14B/stdlib/re.html?i=0&search=re</a>: ) regular expression handling is pretty decent, and it takes binaries, iolists, and of course normal strings (just lists of ints).<p>Erlang strings are just lists of ints, but it's important to know the speed consequences with dealing with the ++ operator, or lists:flatten (which is supposed to be pretty slow, or so I've heard - never personally benchmarked).  Binaries, on the other hand, are more like typical strings in other languages, and don't have the same performance penalty.<p>I'd say: play with it, do some benchmarks, and see how it fits for you.  It's pretty easy to tinker with things on the Erlang Shell (like any REPL) so go for it.  If it doesn't work well enough for you, ask the Erlang Mailing list, which is pretty good at ferreting out speed improvements (recent relevant optimization thread: <a href=""http://www.trapexit.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=19541&postdays=0&postorder=asc&start=0&sid=1f3dad84c9fa26085ca2b631425fae34"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trapexit.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=19541&post...</a> ).<p>And if all that fails for you, then you at least know you gave it a shot and can rule it out.<p>Personally, I think the language is freakin' awesome.",1291520947

I tend to find that people that are extremely passionate about things, do/say incendiary things that tend to attract attention (both good and bad).<p>I respect him for having the balls to say what he really thinks. Not many people do. However, I don't believe that he really believes everything he says. I think he has reached the point where he realizes the pay off (lots of attention), that it becomes naturally for everything he says to come out like that.<p>I am sure that many people would be pushed, but you can push people (and get the most out of them) without being a tyrant.<p>For instance, I played the violin for many years (save the 'he is a pussy for playing the violin' comments...kthnxbi) and had several teachers. I had a mix...some that were clearly doing it for just a paycheck (not pushing me enough), others that pushed me tyranically (a la Calacanis style) that I rebelled against and didn't perform like I knew I could, and my last one that was absolutely amazing at pushing me to leaps and bounds in a much shorter time than I had ever thought I could reach. So much so, that even though I spent an aggregate of 6 or 7 years with the first 2 or 3 and only progressed let's say '2 or 3' levels, with the last, in the space of 2 years, I progressed 6 or 7 levels and actually became a teacher myself - learning those same techniques of learning how people learn and how to get the best out of each individual and pushing them to achieve their best using a mechanism that will work with them.<p>So I say that to say, that every manager/leader wants the best out of their people. Some take a blanket approach (like Jason seems to have done) that, in my opinion, don't work in the long-run and in aggregate...and more importantly would never work for me.

1970953,comment,1970554,1970554,0,0,tomkludy,,,"I had the waveform surgery 3 yrs ago and it was one of the best things I've ever done for myself.  My vision was not terrible before (-1/-1.25 + astigmatism) but afterward I have 20/15 in one eye, 20/20 in the other.  The biggest aspect of the correction was that prior to the surgery, I had very bad night vision - halos and glare - that made it very difficult for me to judge distance or speed of oncoming traffic.  Afterward, my night vision is very good, and those problems are corrected completely!<p>The surgery was, I have to admit, a very frightening experience though it did not hurt.  The recovery was very quick and easy, and I am happy to report that after one month I never experienced dry eyes again and have had literally no negative effects from the surgery.<p>I used to wear contacts until my doctor said my eyes were growing blood vessels they should not have to compensate for the contacts blocking the eye from being exposed to the air, and that those might eventually lead to serious problems.  Then I talked to a family member who had Lasik (non-waveform) and they loved the result, though it caused night halos for them.  So I did the research and decided on the waveform procedure and I am really glad I did.  I would definitely recommend it, but spring for the waveform procedure.<p>Another thing to mention is that my doctor told me that Lasik does not change anything about age-related vision problems, because those are more due to the inability of the eye to change focus than a malformed cornea.  He says you are just as likely to need reading glasses at age 50 after Lasik as you are without it.  The only thing they can do for older patients is an alternate procedure where they change the focus of one eye to nearsighted, and the other to farsighted.  Apparently your brain soon compensates for that and biases to one or the other eye so that you see both near and far things in focus.",1291519821

1970948,comment,1967650,1969616,0,0,marcamillion,,,"Jason,
    I have a theory, based on what I view as the most optimal way that labor markets work.<p>Based on the system that we live in, everybody tends to benefit, when (in aggregate) everybody looks out for their self-interest. If they are not allowed to, there are distortions which actually impairs the benefits to both parties.<p>For instance, if employees look out for their own self-interest, they will do everything to get the best benefits. Likewise, if the company looks out for its own self-interest, it will aggressively try to attract the best talent. By doing that, they force existing employees to look out for their own self-interest by being the best they can be (i.e. as good as, or better than, incoming employees). Also, when companies aggressively try to attract the best talent, they tend to do things like listen to what the talents want and employ those things (more paid sick time, cafeterias, the best development machines, reasonable working hours, etc.).<p>When employees are the best they can be, and their employer is not doing everything they can to retain them, they can leave. That forces the employer to become better at retaining employees - which forces other employers to do the same and creates a perpetuating cycle.<p>So when a company undermines that, by for instance cancelling sick leave, or forcing 80-hour work weeks into perpetuity, the short term effects are that employees will leave (if they are the best they can be at what they do, which we can assume they are otherwise they wouldn't be at the company) to greener pastures and if the company self corrects, they will once again attract and retain the best talent. If they don't self-correct, they will die. Perhaps a slow, long, death. Or just exist in limbo with lots of D class employees providing mediocre service.<p>We see this phenomena playing itself out in the Valley now between Google and Facebook. But it's not new. Before it was Yahoo and Google, Google and Microsoft, Microsoft and IBM, Apple and Microsoft, etc.<p>That's one of the reasons that I think that unions are a bad idea - because they distort this mechanism and allow employees to get lazy and not make sure they are the best at what they do (or add significant value in some other way).<p>Based on my theory, I think you are missing the idea. Forcing your employees to live through hell, but spraying their face with mist every now and then (with chefs, and laundry service - which were, quite ironically, forced on you by your other successful competitors) and telling them they are cool, doesn't make hell any cooler. At the end of the day, it's still hell. And they know it.<p>I don't believe that you would have a chef, laundry service, car washing, etc. if Google, Facebook, et al. didn't have similar services and you weren't competing with them. That, however, is just based on what I have deduced from public statements that you have made - so that could be wrong.",1291519664

1970936,comment,1968611,1970795,0,0,bh23ha,,,"Thanks for the thoughtful response.<p>Let me first clarify that I'm not talking about education as a type of technical school that will teach you what ever skill is hot at the moment.<p>Rather I think the original point of this discussion started with the claim that good design is not just how things looks but rather a deep understanding of how the whole thing works. Knowledge which is <i>both</i> wide ranging <i>and</i> deep is a prerequisite for good design.<p>That is something I strongly agree with.<p>A liberal arts education was suggested as <i>the</i> thing which provides both deep and wide ranging knowledge. And obviously I am bit sceptical of that.<p>For example:<p><i>I view college rather as a place for people to learn more about themselves, and to have the freedoms to discover things they would never discover on their own.</i><p>Exactly! Except I don't quite agree with <i>never</i> discover on their own. College happens to coincide with the time of your life where you are learning the most about yourself.<p>And if you decided to travel the country (or the world) on a motorcycle, I bet you would learn a lot about yourself and have incredible freedom, and discover things you'd never even dreamt about.<p>But I don't mean to disparage college. College also brings together other students and professors and it's very safe, so an absolutely great experience.<p>However, I do find that often people who defend liberal arts education imply that self discovery without it is just not as good. I strongly disagree with that, I don't think you even need college for self discovery. Curiosity and a sense of adventure is just as good. Add travel to that mix and I think few colleges can beat that.<p>The other unfortunate implication is that people who don't have a liberal arts education are a bit shallow or narrow focused, or not quite as well rounded. This I find frankly offensive.  But never mind how I feel about it, I think it's plainly wrong.<p>Science and engineering don't sap student's souls. Scientists and engineers are not all boring, grey people, with no sense for art or music. I recall the Ad Council commercials with a boy telling the street musician to get a job, and a little girl asking her dad to read to her from the Federal Reserve meeting notes.<p>Actually, if I had to name the one area of study which saps people's souls with overbearing work loads, it would be medicine. And MDs aren't exactly known to be shallow or not well rounded.<p>Scientists and engineers love music and art too. I mean how can you look at the Millau Viaduct <a href=""http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/01/wonders_bigdigs/source/3.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/01/wonders_bigdigs/sour...</a> 
and not see the art and beauty in it?<p>Your paragraph:<p><i>For a creative mind, all of these things aid both in specific studies — I could reel out a list of scientific discoveries formulated by scientists who were inspired by an utterly different line of thought — and in the more important study, which is: realizing that the world is interconnected in a lot of ways, and that those connections tend to mirror other connections elsewhere, and that studying all these other things will lead to a richer and deeper education/human being.</i><p>Is a perfect example of implying that scientists and engineers are just not as aware of the nature of the universe, the subtle connections in it, the beauty in it. That scientists and engineers just aren't quite as ""creative"".<p><i>College isn't about me getting a job. It's about me becoming a better person. Liberal arts is geared towards making me more diverse and thoughtful than I would be otherwise. It's working.</i><p>And amazingly science and engineering work in exactly the same way for science and engineering students.<p>I mean literally no one wants to hire software engineers right out of collage. So yeah, pretty much exactly like a liberal arts degree :)",1291519258

Its continued distribution is not the primary problem, the fact that it was created in the first place is.  So the solution to child porn is to find it, use good-old-fashioned police work to find who made it, and use the legal system to remove that person's access to children.<p>No need to break the Internet and restrict free speech for this very-special case.  Let's spend the money we want to spend on censoring the Internet on more detectives, so that child abuse can be eliminated!<p>The same goes for ""counterfeit goods"" or whatever the DHS used as rationale for seizing domain names.  Don't break the Internet; just buy one of the fake watches, ask UPS where it was shipped from, get a warrant, and bust the guys!

Consider the person who was mailed a box of comic books that depicted ""under-age"" children in a sexual context.  The government wanted to put him in prison for 15 years.  For receiving a box of books.<p>""Sexting"" is another example.  It's doubtful that one can abuse one's self, but the government still wants to put people in prison for it.<p>What I find most amusing is that all people look pretty much alike when naked.  I don't understand why naked pictures are such a hot-button political issue.
