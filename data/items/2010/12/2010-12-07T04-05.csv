Chicken Littles like me simply don't want to be quoted by “an idea guy” who wants to “make the new Facebook” in a pitch to a retired plumber.<p>Because anyone know of to use the web and most can sketch a couple of revenue models, a fraction feel like they can invest - that is to say, way too many people. If you say to external investors that high valuation for such or such company is reasonable, they won't be able to make the difference with another project that look very similar to them (both would be bunch of geeks in a garage). I worked for a dishonest guy, helping him pitch: fascination for the billion-dollar idea was alive and well a year ago, and thanks to Sorkin's movie and Groupon financial revelations, they are getting worst.<p>Quick test: if you were not shocked that, in my last sentence I mentioned an “idea” that was worth a lot because ideas are nothing, execution is everything, do <i>not</i> invest (and think hard before working in a start-up).<p>The economic specifics of Silicon Valley (namely signaling, Schelling-type salience) change the assumptions that you need to have a bubble: if a company raises a lot of cash, it gets attention — and that's usually what is decisive to attract talent & revenues.

It was low-enough level to have decent performance and high enough level to be used to quickly do some complex stuff with some runtime protection.<p>I'm curious, the JCP didn't exist until quite a while after Java got going.  There are tons of documents in various states of completion and with various levels of support.  To me, JCP has sort of given java a terrible look to the non-java coder.  It looks fat, bloated and incredibly Byzantine.  I've actually heard developers have conversations about JCP<number>, that just seems like a bad thing to me.  Meanwhile SpringSource has done some great and wonderful things.   Even newer JCP specs, like JPA (if that's 'newer') were sort of done outside of it all and  then backported in to the JCP process.<p>I don't know,  C has been pretty much ""dead"" for decades,  there is  very measured and limited change in that language.  Putting the Java language in a similar place, adding some dynamic support to the JVM and maybe focusing on cleaning up the class libraries and interop with higher level languages might be the best thing for it.<p>I don't know,  it all looks bad, that's for sure but i can't say the JCP was the end all be all either.",1291695765

There are no  technical issues that jeopardize the Java language's future or the JVM's future. Oracle understand the significance of the Java developer community.

Mail addresses are frequently really long and sprinkled with non-alphanumerics. Name kanji are a pain too - there's lots of homophones, so if someone tells you their name you often need to check with them which kanji it is.<p>Basically: it's almost impossible to convey your contact details verbally, so without IR, you usually wind up just swapping phones for a few minutes (luckily, in Japan you can be pretty carefree about handing your multiple-hundred-dollar phone to a stranger).<p>Contrast with the situation until recently in the west, where it was usually just a person's name (that you probably knew how to spell already) and a number, and you can kind of see how IR would be a big deal in Japan and not elsewhere.<p>iPhones have seriously broken contact exchange for young people in Japan, since almost everyone has one, and thus no-one has IR anymore.

I agree with this.<p>You state that a Dynamo-style key-value store wouldn't be that great for a financial institution's accounting system. I agree with this. Dynamo is terrible for ""log"" data.<p>This doesn't change the idea that these system as a whole aren't ACID, and do not require ACID semantics. Financial systems are often based on networks (in the conceptual sense) with varying degrees of trust, and are batch-reconciled logs of transactions. I'm talking about stock and commodity markets, electronic transfer systems, and traditional banking. They may be built from ACID building blocks at the low level, but that does not change the fact that systems that manage my checking account, credit cards, and stock market transactions are not functionally ACID or that they even need to be ACID. Dynamo itself is built on ACID databases, but it is not ACID itself.<p>The balance of an account can be calculated by adding all credits and debits, which is what makes a financial account radically different than say, a Facebook profile. Each transaction is essentially immutable. Even if the transaction must be reversed, it's reversed as an additional credit (or a unique reversal transaction), not a deletion of the original transaction. While transactions against the account are almost always immediately available, they aren't ALWAYS, and this is alright, because the bank's customers understand this. Banks still reconcile accounts on a nightly basis, using batch processes. This is when accounts are officially settled and consistency is applied, which is why it's eventual. However, financial accounts are somewhat unique because their date-sorted, log-structured nature makes them quite suited to eventual consistency.",1291694644
