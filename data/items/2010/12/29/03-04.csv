At all.<p>I disagree with this, and it was Eric Meijer's ""Fundamentalist Functional Programming"" lecture that really changed my mind.  The point isn't that Haskell prevents side effects.  It's that it requires you to be explicit about them.  Indeed, some advocates say that Haskell is ""the best imperative langauge"".  I don't know that I would go that far though.",1293595122

Dave Arnold at the French Culinary managed to make extremely high-quality flavored vodka out of pure food-grade alcohol --- an industrial supply! --- for a couple bucks a gallon. So there's an easy counterexample.<p>In the US, by law, flavored alcohol is not ""vodka"".  Vodka is a tasteless, colorless combination of ethanol and water.  (Trace quantities of various things are allowed.)  Furthermore, vodka with additives is illegal in many jurisdictions.<p>This necessarily leads to a shortage of distinctive vodkas.",1293594943

2047827,comment,2047568,2047568,0,0,tobtoh,,,"One of the things I was taught was that when leading/managing a team, the six things (in order of importance) you should focus on for ensuring a high performing satisfied team are:<p>1. Clarity - ensure your team understands the end goal and what they are trying to achieve<p>2. Standards - ensure standards are set (standard for quality of work, behaviour etc)<p>3. Responsibility - give employees responsibility, trust and hold them accountable for their actions<p>4. Flexibility - give employees control over their work day, don't spoonfeed or straitjacket them<p>5. Recognition & Rewards - positive feedback etc<p>6. Teaming - ensure a team spirit is developed<p>As someone who has managed technial teams from 4 to 90 people, I've found these 6 factors are a pretty good guide. Most people focus on #5 and #6 when discussing how to have a productive team, but you seldom see #1 to #4 mentioned - they may be self-evident, but I've seen more teams suffer from the first four factors being absent or neglected than not.",1293594399
2047826,comment,2047639,2047799,0,0,kjksf,,,"""Ever"" is a difficult time frame to bet against.<p>There are good reasons it won't happen anytime soon.<p>First, there are 2 kinds of Android programming:\n* majority of programs are written to Dalvik VM using either official Java SDK or with clever cross-compilers (I believe C# can be used with mono-based compiler)\n* for performance sensitive programs (i.e. games) code can be compiled to native ARM assembly. There's official NDK from Google based on gcc. However, those programs have very limited access to the system, pretty much enough to write games but you can't access majority of the OS libraries, since those are written in Java and compiled to Dalivk VM.<p>Go already has an ARM compiler so it wouldn't be hard to make it generate native ARM code compatible with Android, like NDK's gcc does.<p>Go, however, has a feature (concurrency based on goroutines/channels) that is fundamental to the language and just doesn't mesh well with traditional runtimes, which are provide good support for threads. Making goroutines/channels work on Java/.NET runtimes is either impossible or would have terrible performance.<p>Again, it's not inconceivable to e.g. modify Dalvik VM to also support goroutines but that's not easy and no-one is even talking about that being a possibility. Go is still a very young implementation, it'll take a year or two before the basics are worked out and then esoteric use cases like supporting Android will invade implementor's minds.",1293594398

They still outsource all manufacturing and fabrication, battery tech, display tech, and storage tech.  They're just integrating enclosure design, chip design, OS design, media sales, and carrier sales.  Of those 4, Google and MS only do OS design.  RIM does OS, enclosure and carrier sales.<p>Importantly, Apple is very easily able to disintegrate when needed.  They're doing their own chip design now, but if someone comes out with an off the shelf chip design that's better than the A4, there's nothing stopping them from building it.<p>Your point makes sense in theory, but I don't think it applies here.",1293594218

As if design was somehow beneath them, or as if it's wallpaper that you can plaster over a project once the code is written to ""pretty it up"".<p>To answer your questions:<p><i>Why are you interested in learning more about design?</i><p>Because I want to spend my career making people feel the way I felt when I first used an iPod. I picked the iPod here because it seems to  be the stock example that gets trotted out whenever someone needs to reference good design, but you can replace it with whatever well designed product you like. We've all had those experiences in our lives where we use something new, and it makes something that was previously difficult easy. That's the kind of stuff I want to spend my time creating, and a sound knowledge of design is a means to that end.<p><i>What have you found confusing about design?</i><p>When and how to break the rules. I'm a fan of Robin Williams' <i>Non-designers Design Book</i> (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Williams/dp/0321193857"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-Robin-Willia...</a>), but as a consequence my projects can look a little sterile because I follow the rules exactly as she lays them out.<p>In contrast, if you go and look at something made by Jason Santa Maria (an outstanding web designer at the top of his game) (<a href=""http://jasonsantamaria.com/portfolio/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jasonsantamaria.com/portfolio/</a>) you'll see he breaks a lot of the rules, and it doesn't matter. In fact, it often times makes the work better.<p>Perhaps you can't codify or reverse engineer that. Jason has design talent. Me, not so much.<p><i>What is one blog post/book/movie, etc. that has helped you better understand something about design?</i><p>I'm fond of <i>The Contemporist</i> (<a href=""http://www.contemporist.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.contemporist.com/</a>) for its great photography of great architecture. It's a great place to draw inspiration. My favourite post so far: <a href=""http://www.contemporist.com/2010/05/20/chicken-point-cabin-by-olson-kundig-architects/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.contemporist.com/2010/05/20/chicken-point-cabin-b...</a><p><i>What software tools do you find useful when designing?</i><p>For HTML/CSS/PHP I tend to use Espresso (<a href=""http://macrabbit.com/espresso/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://macrabbit.com/espresso/</a>). I never mock up web pages in Photoshop. I go straight to code.<p>For desktop software, I'm a big fan of Microsoft Visual Studio's IDE.",1293592152

The house I grew up in would have been < 100 square metres, and the block about 1000 square meters or so. This meant loads of backyard; we had a large workshop (loads of wood, tools etc), a chook run, a few fruit trees, some trees for climbing, paved area (concrete slabs) for bikes, some grass and a veggie patch. Now most houses are well over 200 square metres, and land much smaller. Many new housing developments near us call anything over 500m2 'large'<p>And beyond the house... when I was a kid there were large areas of natural bush land to play in/explore. Now they're pretty much all gone, replaced in part by (what we call) ovals - a grass playing area for footy/soccer and with perhaps a swing and slide in the sun. Not much fun.<p>Roads are busier too. We built a go-kart (non motorised) and my parents had no problems letting us tear down the local hill road in it. Street cricket or footy was also very common, but again, just not possible now",1293592137
