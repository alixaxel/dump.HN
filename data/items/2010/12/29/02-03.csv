2047746,comment,2046849,2047726,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"I get that Groupon wants to be a strong brand, and it is probably rational to grow big quickly before other competitors establish themselves. However, I don't see how its valuation is defensible given how relatively defenseless it is against competition.  It enjoys much weaker network effects than Facebook, and consumers' cost of using multiple services is much lower than, say, using both Google and Bing for every search.  Also, how will they maintain high margins when competitors will likely offer up their services to businesses for a fraction of the margin?",1293591538

2047735,comment,2046849,2046849,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"The guy who owns the salon where I get my hair cut probably wouldn't do a Groupon deal because of adverse selection effects -- he would be worried about attracting a bunch of cheap people who wouldn't pay full price for his premium-ish services and, by virtue of buying into a Groupon, don't have loyalty to their stylists.  However, he is willing to discount services to customers who are likely shopping for a new salon.  A few years ago, he signed-up for a service which would send an elaborate snail mail invitation for a set of heavily discounted salon services to people who recently bought homes in certain high income zip codes around his business.  He owns some pretty sophisticated salon management software which can track conversion rates (and therefore lifetime customer value).  I think he wasn't getting enough conversions to justify the price (a few dollars/invite), but he'd be interested in other such services with the proper selection biases.<p>Could someone compete with Groupon by offering very selective discount offers?  How much would it be worth for Grocery Store A to target those who shop primarily at Grocery Stores B?  Could Visa use its credit card data to build-up such a list?  Could it legally use that list to drive such marketing endeavors?  Would consumers opt into having their purchasing data used in that way if it meant being offered amazing deals from time to time?  How else could one offer up to businesses highly selective campaigns?  The problem with Groupon is that it attracts customers who aren't especially valuable, and businesses have to hope to pick up the minority of those who represent profitable new business.",1293591085

I don't know the details of how PG gets the money he invests, but for what he does there isn't a requirement that he have millions to begin with. He could simply be manager of a fund.

I had just completed my last course that used the IBM 370 with Modula-2 (the base language for UND at the time).  The Internet for me was mostly mailing lists and USENET.  I so wanted a NeXT cube but there was no way I could afford it.  My last papers were completed on a Mac SE/30.  No class I had touched a GUI.  The one class that had Lisp was a nightmare because the VAX had too little memory so the REPL became batch processing with 2 or more students working at the same time.

And, since most salon owners can push the risk downward to their commissioned (paid by the job, really) staff, there's even less disincentive.

The economy isn't zero-sum, but zero-sum is one extreme, with each individuals available raw resources being independent at the other extreme. For available raw resources to be independent, there would need to be infinite land, water, and fossil fuels close to every individual, with no possibility of environmental damage. In reality, the situation is somewhere between the two extremes - the more one individual consumes in absolute terms, the less there is available to others, but it is still possible to grow the pie slightly through innovation. Making developing countries more developed might grow the pie very slightly, but the only way people in those countries will have a developed world standard of living is by giving others now or in the future less in absolute terms.

There's a public Google Doc named ""What I learned from Farmville so you don't have to play it"", really good read on its viral pressure mechanism!
