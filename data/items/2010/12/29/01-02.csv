It's easy to hide flaws in beer, but very difficult to do that in liquor.<p>The time to market is also very different in the two fields. With modern brewing equipment you can go grain to glass in as little as 2 weeks. With a whiskey you're talking at least a couple months of aging.<p>When making beer there are 23 major categories of beer. As a brewer you can make mist of those with just different ingredients. When distilling you're focus is usually on only one type of spirit. In that case it's all or nothing.",1293587863

What we call a smartphone today is a rather different than what was meant when the term was first coined.<p>The first smartphone was pretty much the Nokia Communicator back in the late 90s. It had data connectivity and some limited ability to run applications, and that pretty much what a smartphone was at the time. Today we take it to mean handheld wireless computer that happens to have a phone, but back then if you send a few packets you were a smartphone.<p>I was hired by RIM in 1999 just before they began work on their first phone and spent a good number years writing RIM proprietary protocol stacks that layered on top of the then new GPRS. Coming from a two-way pager background, RIM decided that phones should have two-way push synchronization of pretty much everything that Exchange provided along with a limited WML browser. The general thought was that phones would never have sufficient power density or radios sufficient bandwidth to allow anything more. That was incredibly predictably wrong, but it's how things went down.<p>Along with RIM was Ericsson, Palm, Motorola, and Qualcomm. Motorola came from a similar background as RIM and went on to build very similar devices. Both Nokia and Ericsson had come from phones and had decided feature phones should have far more sophisticated PDA functions. Palm started with PDAs then moved to the phones, but adamantly dismissed ideas like wireless synchronization for years making their first attempts at smart phone far more like early Nokia Communicators than early Blackberrys. Oddly enough, though Nokia made the first smartphone, which was followed by two more with RIM and arguably Palm in 20002, it was Ericsson that popularly coined the term in the mid 2000s.<p>So the point is that all these companies were fighting over what amounts to overgrown PDAs with phones and wireless stacks strapped on. Everyone assumed power density was no where even close to what was needed for general computing, that a full featured browser and heavy duty Internet services were impossible due to bandwidth and latency. Take a look at how our Java expert groups named standards, how people at the time talked about what features smart phones should have, and its clear that no one thought an iPhone was possible. Even Danger, which eventually went on to work on to create Windows Phone 7 and Android, was just working on a better Blackberry.<p>The iPhone did many amazing things, but what stands out in my mind was how it proved that these assumptions were flat-out wrong beyond any reasonable doubt. Apple pretty gave everyone the finger and said, ""Fuck you guys we can build your distant impossible future today.""<p>I left RIM back in 2006 just months before the IPhone launched and I remember talking to friends from RIM and Microsoft about what their teams thought about it at the time. Everyone was utterly shocked. RIM was even in denial the day after the iPhone was announced with all hands meets claiming all manner of weird things about iPhone: it couldn't do what they were demonstrating without an insanely power hungry processor, it must have terrible battery life, etc. Imagine their surprise when they disassembled an iPhone for the first time and found that the phone was battery with a tiny logic board strapped to it. It was ridiculous, it was brilliant.<p>I really don't think you're giving Apple enough credit here. They did something amazing that many very prominent people in the industry thought was either impossible or at least a decade away, and they did it in a disgustingly short time frame.</i>",1293587450

2047606,comment,2047386,2047560,0,0,Rusky,,,"Think of monads as a design pattern. The reason they're named in Haskell is because that language allows you to name a lot of abstract things that most of the time are either ignored or not made explicit.<p>A monad is a type that keeps some value contained, which is like you said a big part of object-oriented programming. Monads are the use of objects for encapsulation, but a bit more extensible than in regular object-oriented languages. The Maybe monad, called Option in the article, is a type that can hold either some value or Nothing. You have to do a null check to get the value, but because it's a monad, you can use the generic function bind to automate this check.<p>The IO monad is just another application of this idea of containing something - all IO operations have the world as their input and output. This is implicit in most languages, but in Haskell it's explicit. Any value you get from the outside world is hidden inside an IO action, but you can use bind to automate the required passing around of the world.<p>One possible reason for confusion is that you can explicitly do null checks with Maybe but you can't explicitly thread the world around with IO. Maybe's method of direct access is public, but IO's is private. Because the /only/ way to get a value out of an IO operation is with bind, you are guaranteed to have all side effects contained in IO actions.",1293587015

I went looking to buy an iPhone the other day, but they are all sold out in my area.  So instead, I bought an iPod Touch and am using a beat up old Nokia - but it annoys me that I need to carry two devices.<p>What the iPhone bought to the table (or rather, massively accelerated - since apps were available before but not in great demand) is convergence of things that we never would have actually carried around before - like a compass, barometer (weather forecast), pocket games etc.<p>Another example that comes to mind: when in London I used to carry a ""Pocket A to Z"" guide, which is basically a book that is a high level map of the city.  It was my top priority purchase on arriving in the UK.  Now though I would simply use an iPhone or Android phone instead.<p>And it is in this area of <i>convergence</i> that I think RIM is falling behind and their lack of vision and bad products (storm etc) are most telling.",1293586267
