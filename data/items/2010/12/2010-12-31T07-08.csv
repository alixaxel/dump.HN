2054875,comment,2054847,2054854,0,0,bugsy,,,"At a place I worked a few years ago we had to individually retest every single unit of our products. This involved opening up packaging and repacking and reshrinkwrapping afterwards. In between unpacking and repacking there was testing and finding about 1/3 of them always had problems. Some boards could be fixed by diagnosing to the component level, replacing components and even resoldering incorrectly wired interboard connects. This work was done by asian immigrants of uncertain immigration status. This rework quadrupled the cost of the products but somehow it was still cheaper than just manufacturing locally to begin with, something like the exact same product was costing $20 per unit from asia, but $200 per unit to build in the US. Apparently the big cost difference was due to the effect of environmental laws regarding not being able to dump toxic waste in a river in the US.",1293782296
2054874,comment,2054449,2054810,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Marx wrote a brilliant critique of capitalism<p>Not really, because he makes a fundamental mistake. He thinks those that hold capital use violence and oppression against the masses.<p>But he's got the cause and effect wrong - the people who use violence and oppression wind up seizing capital.<p>What's the difference? Well, look at history. It's not the merchants and traders and inventors and builders that oppress people - it's the people with swords and guns. Marx's prescription to that is that the oppressed people grab swords and guns and raise some hell, and take over, and then... whoops.<p>The accumulation of resources (private property) and voluntary exchange (capitalism) aren't problems. Violence, coercion, oppression is the problem. Unfortunately, Marx gets the cause and effect backwards. He sees violent people holding capital, and blames the capital instead of the violence. He then says the people without capital should use violence to seize it... with predictably bad results.<p>Marx didn't understand capitalism - he never did productive work in his life. The cause of oppression stems from violence and coercion, not accumulation of resources and voluntary exchange.",1293782290

(This is in both firefox and chrome, on a macbook.) I tried copying the 2d array function and renaming it different things, and found different times, which often caused major differences in its relative order against the original function.<p>Also, running the test multiple times gives different enough results that orderings change.<p>Finally, I think the timing code needs some work. I remember John Resign had some posts on this. This is one of them:<p><a href=""http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-benchmark-quality/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-benchmark-quality/</a><p>But I can't find another one where he talks about the fact that with very small times, timing functions in javascript give wildly varying values, because they depend on some sort of interrupt (maybe?)...",1293779023
