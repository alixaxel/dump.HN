Tcl's lists, for instance, are maintained internally as C arrays of pointers to the element objects. The roundtrip through the string rep can happen, but only if YOU treat the list as a string (more generally, as a non-list).<p>As to ""deep changes to an old language"": Tcl is actively maintained and still evolving.

Clicks lead to revenue, but you need clicks first.  In order to get clicks you need to be competitive.  With Google just a URL away they need to be nearly as good, if not better (due to name recognition) than Google to get a large share of the pie.<p>So the problem is that they must effectively spend (or outspend) Google on search (data centers, employees, etc...) pretty much all the way to the point where they reach parity and beyond.  All the while they bring in a lot less money than Google.<p>If Bing can continue at its current pace and couple it with some real marketing strength, I think they have a real chance of flipping quarterly income from a $500M loss to $500M in earnings.<p>The two wildcards in this space are social (Facebook) and mobile.  I feel like mobile is a bigger deal than social. IMO advertising is the current and future business model of computing.

I think it's approximately just as likely that, at least in some cases, piracy can and has INCREASED income, by increasing hype and interest in a given movie or recording, which drives more awareness of it, which then eventually leads to some sales. Anecdotally, speaking only for myself, I'll admit to having pirated some media, gotten very interested, and then purchased that same media, either to reward the creators, or because I wanted a legit copy or a higher-quality copy, etc. I've also pirated some media, gotten interested, and then recommended it to many others, some of whom have then purchased it.<p>Why do you think it's obvious that piracy will always reduce income?",1293551330

In the ""hello world"" web server example above, many client connections can be handled concurrently. Node tells the operating system (through epoll, kqueue, /dev/poll, or select) that it should be notified when a new connection is made, and then it goes to sleep. If someone new connects, then it executes the callback. Each connection is only a small heap allocation.<p>This is in contrast to today's more common concurrency model where OS threads are employed.

""He's a Nazi!"" is ad hominem.<p>""Has anyone noticed the Jews have an awful lot of banking jobs?"" ""He's a Nazi!"" is, if true, <i>very</i> relevant. The first statement is likely not just a mere observation that may be true or may be false but is historically associated with antisemitism and is probably being used as the thin end of the wedge and not a neutral observation. It's relevant here because it expands into an argument where the origins and motivations of the arguer are in fact very relevant.<p>Similarly, when you see a new physics theory coming from a known crackpot, while the fact they are a crackpot may technically have no effect on the truth value of the theory, when it comes time for you to evaluate the theory you are justified in noticing it's coming from a crackpot.<p>Bayesian logic lets you express it even more cleanly; in Aristotelian logic the motivations of the speaker are irrelevant to the abstract truth of the statement; in more practical Bayesian logic, as you personally examine the likely truth value of somebody else's statement (with no presumption of access to the abstract truth) their motivations can be very relevant. ""ad hominem"" is over-weighting their motivations or falsely weighting their motivations, and under this formulation you also get <i>reverse</i> ad hominem, in which you <i>under</i>-weight their motivations, which is every much a fallacy as the original ad hominem, and which Zed talks about in his post.<p>All things considered, people being hyper about ad hominem is probably better than letting it slide too often, because it is certainly true that on average it is not a valid attack.

You'd have to be a masochist of the first degree.<p>On that note, one of the enormously revolutionary things that Apple did was to break the choke-hold that telcos had over the handset manufacturers.  On an iPhone, you always have access to the App store and iTunes stores... on a Blackberry it is up to the telco whether you get App World at all.<p>In any case, RIM should play to <i>their own</i> strengths, not Apples.  RIM groks business the same way Apple groks consumers.  (But of course business users are <i>also</i> consumers, while this 'should' give Apple a big advantage breaking into the corporate market, they <i>consistently</i> fail to capitalise on it.  I think the difference is they have to fight for the corporate space, whereas in the consumer space everyone else is falling over themselves competing to make the cheapest (read as: least profitable, also in the sense of 'nasty'), ugliest and hardest to use devices).<p>RIM has their own eco-system in the corporate space, mainly revolving around the BES (Blackberry Enterprise Server)... but what does that do?  It encrypts your email and pushes it to you (via Canada).  But is that really such a big deal now?<p>They have a plethora of device models, with differentiation based on presence or absence of things like GPS, trackballs and cameras, and also how wide you want your keyboard to be.  I'm not convinced that having so many options is helpful, but they seem to have a hard time deprecating the old ones.<p>Lately they have been making inroads with the teenage market in the UK because they have a cheap alternative to SMS (one advantage of running your own server infrastructure I guess).  But I wonder how many of those teens also carry iPods?<p>It is easy to look at a Blackberry and say something like ""oh, this is why they're failing, their camera is bad and the browser is worse"".  But that is overly simplistic.  When comparing the iPhone to other smartphones, the iPhone has two killer features: ecosystem and ease of use.  You may put out a phone that physically has all the features of an iPhone, but you get an extra 10% megapixels... and the world is not going to beat a path to your door.",1293549169
2045626,comment,2044040,2044955,0,0,lucasjung,,,"That's very interesting.  Is this happening because fewer women are going into CS, or because way more men than women have gone into the field?  A good way to answer this would be to look at some different statistics: what percentage of women college graduates majored in CS in the early '80s vs. today, and the same comparison for men.  Of course, that doesn't answer the underlying question of why more men than women choose to major in CS.<p>CS was a relatively young discipline in the early '80s, so its share of total graduates has probably grown significantly since then.  I'd be willing to bet that growth is due to both more men and more women entering the field, but disproportionately men.  CS graduates back then were, in a sense, all ""early adopters,"" so both the men and the women in the field were outside of the mainstream.  It could be that men now consider CS to be mainstream, but women don't: among men, the discipline has grown as one would expect, but among women the discipline is stuck at an earlier stage.  Of course, this just leads to further questions about why this disparity in adoption exists.",1293549168

For example, let’s say you have a webpage that has 100 lines of code with 10 database calls.  With a web server like Apache, these 10 database calls must be made in succession.  While running node.js, you can run all 10 of these database calls at once, which makes the webpage load faster.""<p>errr... maybe...<p>""Current web servers must open many connections to interact with their operating system (OS), while node.js only needs to open 1 connection.  Each connection costs the system memory, so using fewer connections is more efficient and faster for the entire system.""<p>there are many lightweight polling webservers like nginx, lighttpd etc",1293549031

After a bunch of lies and general not good things we no longer speak.  It really put a damper on the year.<p>Day Job:<p>Wrote a payroll system for my employer that does exactly what they need and saves them millions annually in software fees.  This was actually a pretty fun project dealing with individual state/country laws and other legal issues that needed to be codified.<p>Learned a lot about Ruby while modifying ECHI converter open source code to work in my employers environment.  Again, this saved a ton of money in licensing fees.<p>Personal Projects:<p>Learned obj-c and a lot about iPhone development.  I made ~$500 from a small utility app.  The rush of someone paying money directly for something that I created is addicting.<p>Other:<p>Deadlifted 510lbs at a bodyweight of 191 lbs.<p>Hiked 5 14ers.<p>This coming year I will get my startup off the ground even if I have to do it completely solo.  I'd also like to hike another 5-6 14ers.  Finally, I will hit my long term strength goal of 500/400/300 deadlift/squat/bench.  I would have hit it last year, but twisted my ankle playing basketball and that kept me from making my squat :)",1293548492

You're not there to do business or woo people - it's all about establishing contact so that you can follow-up with a few and do business and go on a coffee date.<p>What you may find is the simple act of repeated short interactions is the most effective warmup for introversion. The thing is it may take more than one interaction to be warmed up. Five more likely. Any number is better than one.<p>A social experiment I highly recommend: Walk down a not too busy city street and just start smiling and saying hi to people. You'll find most people will ignore you, maybe even give you a negative look. Don't mind them. If you can get to a certain magic number for the environment, you'll find the balance shifting - you'll start to feel energized, fearless, alive and - it is usually at this point that some people respond back in kind. And when that happens, I can schmooze with the best. In a way only introverts can. This might be 50 HIs and smiles later though. Good luck!
