For obvious reasons they don't talk about the details of their software much.<p>The nub of our disagreement: the definition of an embedded system. Per Wikipedia, ""An embedded system is a computer system <i>designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions</i> often with real-time computing constraints.""<p>So a cheap MP3 player counts as an embedded system, because playing audio is what its hardware and software is designed for. A personal computer, in whatever physical form, that runs a variety of applications, including audio players, is not an embedded system. And therefore, no, I don't count smart phone applications as embedded systems software. If you're writing device drivers that are burned into a smart phone's ROM, on the other hand, then I'd consider it embedded software.<p>When you find hardware running Android that's designed to be dedicated to a single task, such as, say, a climate control system, then you can count it as an embedded system. A tablet PC or an application running on it that sends commands to your existing climate control system, not so much.",1292291204

It may seem obvious, but the most difficult time for bees is during winter; almost all hive deaths occur during the colder months.  In a bad winter, some beekeepers will lose up to 75% of their hives.  And hives only ""reproduce"" in summers when they're very strong.

I went there to do Communications and Electronic Engineering in 1981 because it was famous (our own MIT) and hard to get into and I was very disappointed.  Like two other institutions I have encountered, the good people were vastly outnumbered by the bad ones.  I kept having the feeling that we were being taught engineering by a bunch of failed engineers who couldn't hack it in the real world.  That turned out to be true when I worked with some of them later on.  They were bright enough for rote memory and battling fellow academics but they had no real feeling for what they were doing.<p>One of my biggest regrets is that I had an opportunity to move to another uni, less famous but still accredited, after my first year (Freshman) and I didn't take it.

2002767,comment,2000660,2001688,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Record companies work in a similar fashion to the way company store farms and factories work. A typical music recording contract will involve an advance given to the artists which they must pay back via their earnings on a small percentage of the total revenues from their album sales (perhaps 7%). They must use this advance to pay for studio time, music video production, and other expenses. The studio receives a larger percentage of album sale revenues while also ""recouping"" the amount of the advance by taking the portion of revenue that would normally go to the artists.<p>Let me know if you see any issues with this arrangement.<p>Typically, by the time a band has ""recouped"" its advance and has only began to start earning for the artists and has theoretically broken even according to the bizarre accounting of the studios in actuality it has resulted in a return on investment to the studios of several hundred percent.<p>Book publishing is similar but generally not quite so evil.",1292290726
