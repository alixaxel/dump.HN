J2EE 1.4 is more Configuration Over Convention, than the current - more reasonable opposite principle of Configuration by Exception or Convention over Configuration.\nIf I read or hear ""J2EE"" I always have to think about xdoclet with about 50 lines of XML, a Home Interface, Remote Interface and an unrelated Bean class just to implement a helloWorld() method. ...with Java EE 6 a helloWorld() takes exactly one line of code - as it should be.<p>Even JDK 1.5 is End of Service Life and so officially dead for greenfield projects as well. Most of the J2EE 1.4 application servers were not even officially supported on JDK 1.5, so it is truly ancient technology.\nHowever: there is more interests in Java EE 6 - measured in number of session attendees at conferences, blog statistics, number of sold books :-) and project requests, than ever. What also amazed me was the result of my informal surveys after talks at various conferences (JAX, W-JAX, JavaOne and Devoxx). The majority of attendees do use Java EE 5. The minority is using J2EE 1.4. Even the number of Java EE 6 projects seems to be slightly higher, than J2EE. ...and Java EE 6 is only one year young...\nSo J2EE is dead, but Java EE 6 rocks.",1292330420

2003949,comment,2000735,2000968,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"One thing that would really help and guarantee that I use DDG over Google for this kind of search would be to keep your links to documentation pages up to date, or at least give an easy selection.<p>Google is really bad at this. For instance, most links to pages in the Apache docs on Google are for 1.x, which all have a big header that says ""This is deprecated, use 2.x"". I use 2.x so the 1.x links are annoying, and it would be difficult if Apache didn't provide a link right there.<p>Another example is PostgreSQL. Google has _always_ been bad at providing up-to-date links to the PgSQL manual, even now it's usually 8.0-8.2 results that come up (the current version is 9.0.x). It's annoying because Postgres doesn't have an easy jump-to-current link like Apache, so I have to go up to the address bar, delete the older version number, and replace it with my current version number or the word ""current"", which always points to the latest.<p>I know it would be hard to do this for general results, but for official documentation it shouldn't be too difficult since the URLs usually contain the version number in a reliable format.<p>So, if I searched for ""postgresql grant"", as an example, I would like recent results to come up, or at least an easy way to choose which version of the documentation to use before I clicked out. If I have to write ""postgresql grant 9.0"" or something similar that would be OK too. Google does poorly at this even when you specify the version number you want as just shown.",1292329982

2003941,comment,2003567,2003567,0,0,j4mie,,,"I think you might be fighting an uphill battle here.<p>Some developers prefer Python, some prefer Ruby. An individual developer might be able to reel off a list of reasons why one is better than the other, but in the end it comes down to something intangible and subjective - ""Ruby just <i>feels</i> better"" or ""Python <i>fits my brain</i> better"".<p>The concept of ""magic"" is very similar. What feels magical and opaque to one developer might be plain and obvious to another. When you ask what ""magic"" means, you'll get different answers from different people.<p>From my point of view (as a Python/Django developer), even the basic <i>commands</i> that Rails uses feel strange. Compare the very first line of code that you run in a Django project vs a Rails project:<p><pre><code>    django-admin.py startproject mysite\n</code></pre>\nwith<p><pre><code>    rails new blog  \n</code></pre>\nThe former says: ""run the Python script called django-admin.py"" (which immediately tells me that this is just a Python script that I could read, if I were so inclined) and pass the arguments ""startproject"" (which is a clear description of what is about to happen) and ""mysite"" (which is, fairly obviously, the name of the project to start). This reads like a sentence of the form 'use <tool> to perform <action> with arguments <arguments>'.<p>The latter says: ""run the command rails"" (what is this? A Ruby script? A bash script? A binary? Why is it called ""rails"" when the whole framework is called ""Rails""?) and pass the arguments ""new blog"" (obviously this is creating <i>something</i>, but what? In most languages, ""new"" is a keyword that is usually used to create instances of classes - so is it creating an instance of something called ""blog""? Does that mean that Rails knows what a ""blog"" is already?) To me - this is magic. Rails says ""type this incantation and I'll do some stuff for you"". Django says ""here are some tools you can use to do stuff"".<p>You might disagree with me entirely in this particular case - perhaps you find the Rails example clearer - which is fine. The point of this example is to say that framework and language preference is so intangible that the <i>very first line</i> of your documentation can sway someone's opinion either way. Instead of fighting against the ""magic myth"", you should just be trying to attract developers who <i>like</i> your particular brand of magic (or, alternatively, don't see your code as magic at all).",1292329702

Andriod is getting traction (in part) due to some excellent apps. These apps are developed in java that compiles to Android specific bytecode. So, from that, any merged OS would need to maintain the Android VM layer, otherwise backward compatibility would be hard.<p>On the other hand, chrome could be ported to Android quite easily.<p>So I see a Android like OS where Android Apps and Chrome web apps exist side by side (on the same desktop).",1292329517

We might see better survival rates amongst comparatively healthy people.<p>In this case, you don't necessarily need a clean slate. ""All"" you need is a population of cells generating HIV resistant T-cells. AIDS manifests in individuals with extremely low T-cell counts.
