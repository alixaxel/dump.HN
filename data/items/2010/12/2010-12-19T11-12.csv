It took a month to get DSL in my apartment, and every time I wanted to check my mail in that month, I had to go to a coffee shop, or to work. Nobody in my building had an open point.<p>- It's a legal hack: Since my ISP never sees the MAC addresses of the machines connected to my router, there's no way to prove what traffic came from what.

The development process can also be simplified, since you can do much of the development with a browser, compared to re-compiling for each iteration of development.<p>There are of course some applications that aren't suitable for being run in a browser, but in many cases you can, and being able to share codebase between all these platforms seems just great.<p>Arstechnica released their iPad app a month ago, based on HTML5/CSS/Javascript and built with PhoneGap, and they explain very well how and why they did it that way: <a href=""http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/11/introducing-the-ars-technica-reader-for-ipad.ars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2010/11/introducing-the-ar...</a><p>I would definetely learn regular web development, and not lock myself down to a single platform.

You should be proud.<p>>> Well, thinking about the interface and implementing the programming logic was actually fun. And it took 10% of the time. The other 90% was spent fighting with browsers' quirkiness and with Google App Engine (if I skipped GAE I would have fought with sys admin so not better I suppose). And that was teeth-cringing.<p>welcome to programming.  programming is the gentle art of staying sane while dealing with the stupid choices of the programmers that have come before you (when you do this long enough, you will start to appreciate the difficulty in making good programming choices.) the deeper your knowledge of a given stack, the less pain you will experience.  What's that old saying? ""An expert is someone who has made most of the common mistakes in their field.""<p>Some platforms are better than others, targeting one platform is always easier than targeting multiple platforms with the same codebase.<p>However, iOS programming is far less instantly-rewarding than web programming.  It also requires a deeper understanding of the way computers work, because the resource-constrained device does not play well with high-level languages.<p>I suggest that you learn c, obj-c and cocoa because it will make you a well-rounded programmer.  after 6 months, you will then know if you like low-level stuff or web stuff better.  if you want to be doing the next thing for 20 more years, it is worth 6 months to determine what fits you best in an empirical way.<p>Check out <a href=""http://www.phonegap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.phonegap.com/</a> you might like it.<p>p.s.

2021514,comment,1993882,1994085,0,0,psykotic,,,"> HAIFA is a response to MD that (among other things) eliminates length-extension attacks.<p>Sorry to reply belatedly, but after reading the HAIFA paper I'm a little confused. When the message is a multiple of the block length, doesn't HAIFA still depend on padding for protecting against length extension attacks? At the bottom of page 4 the paper says, ""If this value [the number of bits processed so far] is not a multiple of a block, then the resulting digest does not equal the chaining value that is needed to the expansion of the message. If the message is a multiple of a block, then an additional block is hashed (with the padding) with the same number of bits hashed so far."" Later they also mention that they use basically the same padding scheme as in MD: ""The padding scheme used in HAIFA is very similar to the one used in the Merkel-Damgaard construction, i.e. the message is padded with 1, as many needed 0s, the length of the message encoded in a fixed number of bits, and the digest size.""<p>My impression from my admittedly cursory reading of the paper is that protection against extension attacks wasn't a motivating factor for designing HAIFA. The major motivation, at least going by the paper's internal evidence, seems to be protecting against a kind of pre-image attack based on finding fixed points of the one-way compression function.",1292757082

It all depends on what you want to achieve and programming is just a means to an end.<p>Also, under the hood all 'kinds' of programming are essentially equal (in spite of many religious arguments to the contrary), it's in the end just a way to very specifically tell a computer what you want it to do and in that respect any programming will serve as a way to get better at every other kind of programming.<p>The more you do it, the better you get, just like with every other skill.<p>Good luck!",1292757032

It would be nice if someone took this comparative analysis of programming languages a little more seriously and go beyond the tiresome ""should a semicolon be a separator or a terminator"" or the naive imperative-functional distinctions.<p>Take for example ML (prototypical high-level functional) vs C (prototypical low-level imperative). What makes them essentially different? In ML you have the common imperative features (assignment, references) and in C you can write functions including higher-order (via pointers). The answer you are looking for is ""memory management"", automatic in ML versus manual in C. Everything comes out of this distinction, down to the fact that in C you don't have lambdas and currying (because no garbage collection means no closures).<p>What makes ML and Algol 60 different? Both have a strikingly similar set of primitives, imperative and functional. The difference is call-by-value in ML vs. call-by-name in Algol 60, which leads to global effects in ML vs. local effects in Algol 60.<p>What makes Lisp different from Scheme, the misunderstanding of alpha conversion in Lisp versus its correct implementation in Scheme.<p>And so on.
