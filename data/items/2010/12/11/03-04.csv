They tested couples and their satisfaction with marriage, and then formulated type recommendations. This is also how the career counseling angle works. They actually test people in various careers and then find who is happiest and most successful, and this is what forms the basis of recommendations for career counseling based on MBTI results. It's not subjective but based on what tends to work out well in terms of happiness between people in relationships and between person and career in large populations.<p>For relationships the results are sorted not by the most common pairings, but the most successful.<p>As far as INTJ meeting ESFP, it does happen. People meet in bars, get references from others, meet in church. Perhaps INTJ is tutoring math to ESFP who is studying to be an elementary school teacher and they start dating.<p>In a relationship this is a pretty good entrepreneurial husband/wife pairing as well. Husband makes the product, wife does sales and marketing (ESFP specialty) and finds out from customers what they really need. ESFP in this case will help him understand and interface with the bureaucratic mentality, and also provide a front face and extremely enthusiastic explanations of his incredible value to the company he works for, or the investors who are funding him, or whatever he is up to. She'll also naturally bring him into contact with these investors, partners, or mentors and massively leverage his life opportunities, which will lead to a lot of success and happiness.<p>The world is not made for INTJ or INTP and does not understand either of them. The right partner can and will completely solve this problem.<p>With opposite pairings, there is no friction or stress from one trying to change the other because they are so different that sort of change is thought impossible, it would be like an elephant trying to change a giraffe into an elephant.",1292039950

There are a number of things I <i>like</i> about Grails (GORM, domain-first approach, etc).  But there are still some things which bely the Java-ness of it, and I'm convinced most of the Java community doesn't ""get"" the web.  Hard to put in to words, but an example might be:<p><a href=""http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILS-3364"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/GRAILS-3364</a><p>The default in the Java world up to that point (and possibly still is) is to put a session ID in the URL.  That's been frowned on and not default behaviour in the PHP world for... well since almost always.  It's just asking for trouble (intentional or accidental).  But the default for Grails was to have this on, because that's just how Java people think.<p>And the answers?  Configure yet some other aspect of your system (""just change jetty's config""-type answers).  Why not give more control to the framework instead of forcing people to have to learn/manage yet more systems and components.  That particular issue is 'fixed' now, but there's so many moving parts that I wouldn't be surprised if it is broken again in some configurations (hasn't been for me though).<p>As much as I love Grails, Java as a base platform was not written with the web in mind, and makes basic stuff harder than it should be.",1292039385

1994085,comment,1993882,1993882,0,0,tptacek,,,"Well, CubeHash didn't pass, keeping Daniel J. Bernstein (mostly) out of the running for SHA-3. Oh well. Meanwhile:<p>* BLAKE combines DJB's ChaCha stream cipher core with Eli Biham's HAIFA framework; HAIFA, like Merkle Damgard (MD), isn't a hash function but rather a scheme for turning things like the core of another cipher into a hash function; HAIFA is a response to MD that (among other things) eliminates length-extension attacks. I hope BLAKE wins.<p>* Grøstl (meaning ""hash"", in the ""corned beef"" sense) is a hash that borrows heavily from the internal components of AES, and includes among its contributors one of Vincent Rijmen's (of AES nee' Rijndael fame) gra students.<p>* JH is a Singaporean design similar to Grøstl in the sense of borrowing AES machinery, and is optimized for hardware.<p>* Keccak is a hash built on ""sponge model"", which (like HAIFA) is an alternative to the classical MD construction, and was co-designed by Joan Daemen (also of Rijndael fame). Keccak looks like the most interesting design in the contest.<p>* Skein is Furgusen and Schneier's design, based on their Threefish block cipher function (which they designed for the hash). Threefish is said to be similar to DJB's Salsa20 stream cipher; the Skein hash combines it with ""UBI"", a custom version of the Matyas-Meyer-Oseas compression function (which is <i>extremely</i> simple; just Wikipedia it). Skein appears to have more real cryptanalysis results against it than the others, and maybe a little less theory and a little more practicality.<p>Colin will I'm sure chime in with more math details, which go right over my head.<p>SHA256 is widely considered sound as it stands today. The big problem with it is that it's bulky and slow. So the first thing you'd hope to get from SHA3 is speed.<p>SHA256 is a classical Merkle-Damgard design. The MD construction is widely considered outmoded. So the other thing you expect to get from SHA3 is a cipher that uses a different fundamental construction for taking a block function and turning it into a hash.<p>A nice side effect of getting rid of MD is that you no longer have length-extension attacks. It's shocking when this sinks in, but the output of (say) SHA1 is simply the internal state of the SHA1 hash at the point where the input starts. The SHA1 design starts with a series of 32 bit registers and grinds plaintext through them; a SHA1 hash is simply the resulting 32 bit registers, catted together. What this means is that attacks can feed <i>more</i> plaintext to through SHA1, without knowing what the original plaintext was, simply by using the output of a SHA1 hash as the initial values of the SHA1 registers. Bad! This, by the way, is the reason you use HMAC-SHA1 and <i>never</i> SHA1 to authenticate messages.<p>I hope BLAKE wins, but if it doesn't, I hope Keccak wins, because its design seems to be the furthest from what we have today (HAIFA seems like a direct evolution of MD, and Matyas-Meyer-Oseas basically seems like calling CBC-MAC a hash function). But I am not the least bit qualified to hold this opinion! I just break shit.<p>Interesting how likely it is that either Vincent Rijmen or Joan Daemen (or both) will have their fingerprints on <i>both</i> AES and SHA3.",1292038859

1994063,comment,1985596,1985986,0,0,jjoe,,,"Hi there,<p>Keep in mind that writes will always be faster than reads thanks to cache write-back. This is because writes are asynchronous at the kernel and controller level. When your app writes a file, it indirectly writes it to the disk cache. If the data is needed almost immediately after the write, chances are the read is going to be as fast because it's still present in the cache.<p>Now, the reason why reads are generally slower than writes has to do with the fact that the app <i>must</i> wait for the read to complete (to present the data to the user). So be sure to focus on read performance and get a good UPS.<p>I should have asked for a budget ballpark. But let's assume you can't afford buying several 250GB SSD disk (double for RAID-1). That's where I would recommend a stripped mix of SSD and SATA RE3. So if you have, say, 2x250GB SSD and 2x1TB SATA, you would RAID-1 the SSD pair and RAID-1 the SATA pair then +0 RAID across the resultant logical volumes. That's RAID-10 but with manual stripping. You can save quite a bit this way. Also, be sure to choose a small tripe size so each file is split amongst the RAID-10 evenly and improve performance (ex: 40% of the file is on SSD and 60% on SATA).<p>I'm not sure what to recommend as far as hosting because I don't have any info here. Colo has its advantages but it can get expensive. Colo costs can be excessive. The hardware, staffing, electricity, bandwidth, routing/switching equipment, maintenance, etc. Be sure to colo as close as possible to your office/home so you can take care of emergencies quicker. DC staff isn't always to the most competent so you'll either have to learn as you go or hire someone.<p>Renting is interesting (let's say you're getting a fully managed node). You don't have to worry about staffing, 4AM trips to the DC, contracts, hardware depreciation, replacement contracts, or contingency plans when the main server decides it won't boot. It's all handled by the provider. If you pick a smaller provider, you'll be sure to get better service as they tend to have more of a personal service.<p>Renting a multi-TiB dual quad core server with SSD and SATA can be anywhere between $800 and $1200 per month depending on server management and bandwidth. Colo costs are more complex and depend on many factors.<p>Keep in mind that I can be biased considering my role / occupation in the managed server sphere.<p>Regards<p>Joe",1292038030
