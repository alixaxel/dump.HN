Just because more people groupon, does it make competitors less valuable?  Is it a barrier to have emails from livingsocial <i>and</i> groupon arriving in your inbox every day?  Groupon is almost the complement of fb -- fb had huge lockin, but no obvious monetization method.  Groupon has obvious monetization, but no lockin that I can see.<p>I also question in the long run how many businesses have large enough customer LTVs that selling stuff below cost is worth it to hook customers.  Hearing from eg hair salons that groupon people aren't customers but are bargain hunters isn't promising.<p>My prediction -- in 3 years, groupon will regret this if they haven't found a different sucker.

We will be equal when a woman hits a man in the face, and the man responds in kind by punching her, and nobody says anything about ""hitting a woman"".</i><p>There's a reason that social moor exists. Until women catch up in physical power, or men regress, most men will have the power to seriously injure a woman and walk away unharmed, unless the woman is trained or armed. As such, it is a man's duty to take responsibility for this difference, and that is where the taboo on striking a woman came about. There's a partner taboo as well- regarding children- that exists for exactly the same reasons.<p>Would you argue that someone more powerful does <i>not</i> have a responsibility to manage their strength, and using brute force on women and children should <i>not</i> be considered reprehensible?",1291427765

In the first few cases I felt obligated to stay - I'd given my word, right? But the bullshit just meant that I just ended up contributing to the toxic environment by being an asshole out of resentment. I began to wonder if it was just me. Others certainly insisted it was. About six years ago I got a therapist and a psychiatrist. Best thing I've ever done. It was clear after talking to a professional that the situation was toxic. I got myself onto a smaller team within that company with some awesome people and really enjoyed myself. Unfortunately the toxicity remained, our lead quit, and we instructed to do what our lead would not. I'm quite proud that our team said ""no"", and said that the plan we already had was the right one. We were all let go. Ok, <i>that</i> was the best thing I've ever done.<p>My advice, then, if you are up for it, is to imagine what <i>would</i> light you up at this company. What would get you excited about it again? Figure that out, and do it. If you really are that good, then have faith in yourself. Give yourself a shot. Give your partners a shot. And if it doesnt work, quit. Unless this company is curing cancer its just not that important.<p>PS What amazes me about toxic environments is not the number of toxic assholes (actually quite small), but that most everyone else chooses to be enablers for these people.<p>PPS I did go on meds, but as another poster says here, it can take a while to find the right one - one can make you wired, another lethargic. The best thing to do is exercise and eat right; but the meds can help you get started (IMHO).",1291427459

One think you should avoid is being alone and/or trying to bear what you're going through alone. If the root cause is related to your company and if you have friends there, then you should open up with them and solve it together.

PHP based content management systems job are only tangentially related to programming. Drupal (and Joomla, etc.) exist so that companies can manage their websites without a programmer.<p>That may not be fair, but it's how the hiring companies (direct or recruit) will look at.
