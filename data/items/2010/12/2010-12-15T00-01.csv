Well, I could decide to only target the rows with a low work factor. Since your entropy estimate is high for these rows, I can know that it's more likely they'll be 8 characters or longer and use a wider range of characters. I can likely ignore all candidate passwords that are shorter or that do not include non-alpha characters.<p>How useful is this? Let's assume 2 choices of work factor.

The wedding was supposed to happen last year but got nixed because my business had just entered free-fall and I was a ball of stress.  Now the situation is crappy, but well-defined, so I no longer panic about finances.  She would wait again if I wanted, but that's not what I want, either.<p>- I did quite a bit of consulting in the past year, as we were winding down the company.  The positive side was that the pay was fairly good and it helped scrub a lot of debt (there was a point where I was down close to $200k.)  The minus side was that I felt stressed by having what was more of a collection of part-time jobs than a business or a career.  This downside is amplified by the fact that I stopped enjoying dev work, hate doing outside sales, and I legitimately miss having to go to an office each day.<p>- Right now, a steady paycheck is exactly what I crave.  I have a roadmap laid out that includes both a corporate and an entrepreneurial fork, but both start with me working in the PMO or IT PMO of a relatively large corporation for the next four years, then move to Singapore and attend INSEAD.<p>- Thank you for your post.

Actual muscle mass has less to do with being strong than leverage and nervous system development.<p>Leverage is genetic and there's not much you can do about having long arms.<p>What you call ""muscle memory"" is the strength and frequency of nervous system signaling - most strength gains come from changes in the nervous system.<p>That's why there's tons of drug-free power and weightlifters who don't have a ton of muscles but are extremely strong. Conversely, there's tons of bodybuilders using steroids who can't actually lift all that much. This is because muscle mass is mostly dependent on hormones.<p>You don't gain muscle by lifting weights so much as you raise your testosterone level by lifting weights, which promotes muscle growth.<p>So athletes can come back quickly in terms of strength, but not so much size.<p>From what I read about Tim's ""muscle gain"" advice (he posted the story on his blog) it was mostly just water and fat. I bet he started out by dehydrating before the experiment, too. Assuming you start out slim it's very easy to gain 34 pounds in a month by drinking water, eating a ton of high-carb foods and taking creatine (I've done ~20 pounds in two weeks this way to go up a weight class). The only way you're going to gain any muscle that way is with weightlifting (a lot more than 4 hours) or steroids, and preferably both.",1292371814

In other words, it appears to make the model more complicated and less aesthetically pleasing.  Skimming the article, the author appears to make a fairly arbitrary seeming argument about how those constants ought to vary with time which simplifies things a bit, but it's still more complicated than traditional GR with a constant c and G.<p>It's not clear to me how this model purports to solve the flatness problem.  There just seems to be an assertion that because the model predicts a 3-sphere geometry that the flatness problem is moot, but that seems to dodge the question.  The whole point of the flatness problem is that space appears to be flat, and not a 3-sphere or hyperbolic.  If you say it's a 3-sphere, the problem becomes why the universe ought to be so big that the curvature isn't apparent.<p>Similarly, the claim to solve the horizon problem is unsatisfying.  Most attempts to explain the horizon problem require you to assume that the universe was once much, much smaller and expanded very rapidly at some point (inflation).  This model appears to give you a knob to do that (variable speed of light), but doesn't really say why it should have evolved in that way.<p>Finally, there are some red flags to be had here from observing that the author works in the statistics department, appears to have never published any previous physics research, and in 5 months has not gotten this paper published in a peer reviewed journal and has not been cited by any other work.<p>Bottom line: I wouldn't put much weight on this.",1292371282
