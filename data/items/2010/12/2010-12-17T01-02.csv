This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just my observation.<p>a few things I see that I'd kinda miss from delicious:<p>1) instead of seeing how many people are linking to something as a number, it instead has an ""also shared by:"" feature instead. I honestly like just seeing a number of how many people are sharing it more than seeing if a few random people are also sharing something. It also helps me judge whether someone linked a ""big news item"" or something they were personally digging for info on.<p>2) multiple tag filters - i.e. search multiple tags for my personal bookmarks.

The demo mode does a mirror-image reversal of the word to show you that it can detect words.<p>I was using a 4th gen iPod Touch, so lower-res camera and no flash.<p>Unfortunately, I was not able to get it to work as well as I'd hoped. I tested physical copies of a few things:<p>1. Mac OS X Snow Leopard cd case. Black sans-serif text on white background. This worked the best, with the word-reversal consistently getting ""Snow"" and ""Leopard"" reversed with little flicker. ""Mac"" seemed to go in and out. OS was rarely replaced, and usually along with ""Mac"" as though it were part of the same word.<p>2. C++ Programming language book cover (<a href=""http://pixhost.info/pictures/631454"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pixhost.info/pictures/631454</a>). Dark blue serif text on white. This almost never worked. When it did recognize letters, the recognition shifted so much that the word was a constantly moving jumble.<p>3. Throat Coat tea bag. White serif text on Red. At any point in time, about 50% of the words were recognized and reversed.<p>You can take a snapshot, and each word it recognizes is highlighted, which is pretty cool.<p>I would definitely buy something like this that handled non-romance languages to English.",1292550649

Basically, the conclusion they came to was that the difference between a good wine and a mediocre one had to do with the esterification that occurred during aging and the amount of vanillin leeched from the wood barrel.  They indicated that you could probably take an inexpensive wine and add a little bit of vanilla extract to it and it would taste like a better quality wine.  (Wine producers are prohibited from doing this sort of thing themselves, but you can do it at home.)
