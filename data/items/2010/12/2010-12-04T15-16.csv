I wish I could write as clearly and persuasively as Jolie O'Dell, but I can't, so let me just say ...<p>All due respect to those of you putting in time, effort and sweat into your project, but being a project does not, of itself, make it a startup.  I'm not going to provide a checklist as O'Dell does, but a project, although worthy of respect, is not necessarily a startup.<p>ADDED IN EDIT:<p>I should also have said this: I don't care.  The labels people use are largely irrelevant, including the labels you give yourself.  What matters is your drive and intent to make something, and in doing so, to make the world a better place.  I don't care if you are, or are not, an ""entrepreneur"" by whatever system of labelling someone uses.  I also don't care if what's taking your time is a project, hobby, startup or complete time-sink.<p>What I do care about is that people who can should be encouraged to use their limited time to build something that matters: to them, to others, possibly to the world in general.",1291478382

The government can exact capricious petty revenge on your business, so it's not the business's fault for exercising cowardice?<p>It would be unbelievably easy to rightfully Godwin your perspective on this issue, but I won't do it.<p>The United States is a nation predicated on a set of inviolate rights that are supposedly protected by the charter document of the nation itself.  Among these rights are the right to hold property, conduct affairs freely, and speak freely.  The courts have repeatedly defined rights that are derivative of our constitutionally-protected ones, and that among these are the ability to conduct business free from the threat of arbitrary governmental coercion( e.g. absent of a ""chilling effect"" ), with obvious exceptions made where the business has committed a crime.<p>PayPal, Amazon, et. al.  Have not broken the law by providing services to Wikileaks, and are, therefore, not in danger of retribution by the government specified in the US Constitution.  The salient point here may be that the government we have is possibly NOT the government specified by the US Constitution, and these companies ARE in danger of capricious revenge by the government.  And if this is the case, we as a nation are living under the thumb of a truly illegitimate government - and we have bigger issues to worry about than the cowardice of companies.<p>But whether or not we exist in a nation of arbitrarily exacted State power, nothing changes the fact that Amazon and PayPal are corporate cowards, in the absence of an actual, honest-to-god court order.  To say they should be held harmless is, well, an ""interesting"" perspective.",1291478227

The Flash chips in SSDs are already somewhat like dynamic RAM, though not quite as fast and with some extra requirements and limitations.  One could easily give the illusion of a laptop with 256 Gigabytes of <i>orthogonally persistent</i> RAM by using 8 Gigs or so of dynamic RAM as a cache into Flash RAM.  No need for any notion of a separate persistent store like a Hard Drive.  No need to even boot up!  Laptops would only have ""hibernate"" and ""sleep"".

1969349,story,,,2,6,jim84,"Ask HN: How does a founder judge quality if they can't code?",,"I am the founder of a small Canadian based startup which is currently in development.  My background is business/economics and the project I am developing is a social network.  I’m doing this startup by myself and with my own investment 30K.  I’m not a techie so I shopped around for a company which I could hire to do the development. I eventually settled on an Indian company with a good track record of developing social networks. 
So far I’ve been very pleased with the company’s work and they have done an awesome job in the design phase. But during the design phase I have been managing the Indian team, to ensure quality, that they are meeting the project requirements, and make sure they understand what it is I’m trying to create.  But in about a month, starting in January we are going to be finished with designs and move into programming.  
Here is my problem:
Once we get into programming, I no longer have the ability to judge quality and make sure they are meeting the project requirements. I pretty much know zero about coding so if I looked at some amazing code and some awful code side-by-side, I wouldn’t be able to tell the difference.  This is a really dangerous position for me to be in because I’ll be making decisions that I have no qualification to be making.
I’m not going to sit back let the company do whatever they want and I’m also not going to try and manage the technical side either. I’ve been talking to other startup guys and they all recommend getting either a CTO, consultant or a tech cofounder.  The issue of course is money/equity. I don’t like the idea of giving a huge portion of my company to a cofounder or CTO. Plus I don’t know any. I’m favoring bringing on a consultant who I can pay an hourly or flat fee to do some project management for me.
My project isn’t huge, only 30K fixed price (10k design, 20K coding). And all I really need is a tech guy to come in and look at the code make sure it’s good and make sure the company I hired is doing things properly. 
Everyone I’ve talked to says I need to bring in a tech cofounder who is a rockstar to do the coding for me.  But I just don’t get it. I already have development team, and I shouldn’t assume they write shitty code just because it’s outsourced. But I do need someone to check it for me.  I agree I eventually need a rockstar development team but if I bring in cofounders after beta instead of before they will be taking a much lower equity stake. Right now I don't need a developer capable of programing artificial intelligence. I just need good quality programing so I can launch the beta, test it in market and then develop the amazing technology behind it if its accepted by consumers.Because you can have the most amazing technology in the world but if people don't like the product, then there is no point.<p>Am I wrong? Any suggestions how I can fix this without giving away a huge portion of my company to a stranger, or going broke paying a consultant?
Any advice is welcome. Thanks.",1291476153

I doubt they would object to an LLVM front-end, and I'm sure someone will create one in the future.<p>As to why Google doesn't use LLVM, the generated code is simply not as fast as GCC. Google (last I heard) employs about 30 compiler engineers to support gcc internally, so they're not about to switch over to a less mature platform, even though it shows great potential.",1291476089
