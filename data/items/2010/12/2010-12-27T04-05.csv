To say nothing of the pocket paper notebook.<p>Now, thanks to the Kindle app, my <i>library</i> is shrinking.<p>My portable audio recorder's days are numbered. (The stumbling block: when you're recording audio you really want to be able to do it for an hour or two at a time, without stopping for <i>anything</i>, so you don't really want to do it with your smartphone. What if you have to take a call, or tune an instrument, or do a calcuation on your H-P calculator simulator in the middle of recording? But these things are getting so cheap that soon I'll just be able to buy a dedicated one for audio recording. Or maybe it'll just multitask well enough to record audio in the background, with the mics attached by a cord.)<p>The cost of the smartphone is still too high, and the durability too low, for it to quite replace every single one of my paper field guides for birds and animals -- you want to be able to use the thing in the rain, while standing in the mud, with one hand, without flinching -- but that's almost there too.",1293425866

It will be a huge market, so businesses need to get out in front of it. But replicatorblog's point (as I understand it) is that iOS will still own the high-end of that market, and that segment is worth more $$$ than its number's suggest. If you're in control of the high-end, you can exert undue influence on consumer mind-share and developers. That matters for something.<p>Anyway, IMO this is not an iOS-vs-Android issue. New markets are going to open up, Android will be there. iOS will still be a cash-cow. Win-win, everybody celebrate (except Microsoft)",1293424986
