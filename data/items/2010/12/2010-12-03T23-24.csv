Peering with L3 ensures Netflix streams are delivered with decent service levels, which satisfies their customers.

I can't find the citation just this second, but there was an article floating about showing that successful founders tend to be much more successful on subsequent projects than the baseline.<p>I don't think it's chaos or luck. I've argued it before, but there are traits that make successful founders successful. The one that always stands out to me is an absolute laser focus on analytics. These founders are 'obsessively analytical' which allows them to make decisions much faster than others.<p>Starting a company is a race. Your trying to reach profitability (or at least viability) before your current funding dries up. For boot-strapped companies that can be a matter of weeks. For VC companies that can be years. In each of the cases in the article they lost that race.<p>So starting a company is largely about managing that runway. Some people get lucky and just get it right. For the rest of us tracking <i>everything</i> and truly being obsessed with that data allows you to see patterns, opportunities, and problems much faster. I suppose that you could say that data-obsession allows you to achieve hindsight much faster.<p>I have one failed startup (out of three goes).  In that one I failed to keep an eye on my data. In particular, I didn't realize just how slowly our development was progressing relative to the amount of runway we had. In the end we released a product that never found a market fit and simply didn't have an opportunity to pivot. We ran out of money, and with it the business went belly-up.<p>My most recent venture is about 3.5 years old. In that time we've had one <i>massive</i> pivot (think entirely new business that utilized about 20% of the code we developed). We managed that by keeping close tabs on our development schedule and releasing as early as possible. It became clear that our initial idea would work, but the cost of acquiring customers was far too high. We felt like we couldn't optimize that cost down to something reasonable in the time-frame that we had left. We did, however, find a new business model along the way and we've aggressively pursued that all the way to profitability.<p>Now we're looking at different data. Conversion rates, traffic, and ad-spend rule my world now. We track everything we can think of. We've found patterns for our business that have allowed us to optimize our spend while increasing traffic. We've moved our conversion rates significantly. We still have a long ways to go, but at this point we have a nice war-chest in the bank and are at the point that we can aggressively scale. Along the way we've pivoted, just less drastically. The product has changed significantly as we've come to understand our market. We're pursuing a couple of opportunities that we never even thought about during initial development.<p>I feel really good about our business. I think we're going to make it. We've done that not through chaos or luck, but measurement and optimization.",1291419754

Uuuhm. And I don't get tired - I have only experienced being tired a couple of times in my life, it's typically from running the marathon and so I need people who are indefatigable, people who have pretty high stamina. I need people who are intense. I need people who can perform at a high level on a pretty regular basis. And I need people who are able to engage in debate. And so I need pretty strong people. I decided I am not going to work for people who are weak and who are maybe looking for balance in their lives. I do view doing a startup company like an Olympic sport. You have to qualify for it. If you don't qualify for it, then you can't be on the team. And if all of a sudden you get slower, and can't keep up, then you have to leave the team, and be replaced by somebody who can. And if you have a team of people who are all Olympic caliber, and who all are running very fast, it doesn't feel like everybody is running fast, it's just how we run, we are fast runners, or hard runners.  And you just have to hire the right people. So I think I'm intolerant of average people. I am infuriated by people who make excuses. And so depending on who comes to work for me, and if you interview 100 people who have worked for me, if the person was ambitious and hard-working, they would tell you that it's the best experience of their lives, and that they learned more working for me, got more opportunity, tripled their salary. I have had people literally come in, work for me, 30 or 40 thousand dollars out of school, and then two or three years later would be making 100 thousand dollars. That's my value proposition. If you come work for me, you are going to work very hard, not harder than I do, maybe equal, but no harder than I expect of myself. But you will learn everything, and I will teach you everything I know. Calacanis MBA in 3 or 4 years. And if you do, then I will get you a job anywhere you want to work. If you have done 3 or 4 years for me, I will invest in your company if you come up with a good idea. I will come on your board, if you come up with a good idea. I will introduce you to anybody I know, give you recommendation and support you in any way I can. Take the other half of people, who maybe I've fought with, or fired. or they quit, they tended to be people who were lame, not hard-working, looking for balance, not intense, not winners, not looking to succeed, and they would say ""Well, I'm just a normal person"". I would say: ""Correct, you are a normal person. I am an abnormal person. You normal person came to work for an abnormal person. I have abnormal expectations, that are high. You have normal expectations."" It's nothing wrong with that, but that person should have gone to work at the post office, or Starbucks, or IBM, or whatever place where average people can exist without having some insane maniac like me say: ""Why didn't you figure this out? Why didn't you work harder? Why did you make all these mistakes?""  At a big company, no one would ever confront them. They would just hide under their desk, and maybe 9 months later somebody would say: ""What do you do here? Oh cool."" And for people who just want to duck down and disappear, there are plenty of jobs out there. I don't want those. I want samurai. People who come in and fight, and cut arms off and crash through stuff. If there is a barrier and a problem, I want people who can just hack their way through it, and not stop until they are dead or they have killed whatever is in front of them.

We have no idea we're reconstructing -- the governing dynamics of cortical, much less subcortical, interactions are still nearly totally unknown to us -- and memristors do nothing to shed light on that.  Further, neural codes are digital and memristors are analog elements.  There's no property of memristors that makes the job of ""building a brain"" easier than it would otherwise be.  The point that the metaphors are closer because there's no separation between computation and storage is missing the larger issues.",1291417431

1967786,comment,1966927,1966927,0,0,verysimple,,,"My partner and I are both programmers and I was recently tasked to hire our first employee.<p>We have a certain ideal environment in mind that we would like to create for other programmers. In short, the plan is to hire the right people, trust them with their responsibilities and respect their freedom, time and space. We rely on our own past experience and other niceties straight from Peopleware. Some of the key criteria we want to go for are curiosity and interest in programming (what have you done in the past, what do you like about it, what's your next move, etc),  problem solving ability (puzzle, maths, etc), autonomy (do you teach yourself, can you improvise, etc). Language choice and experience give some weight, but are not our primary interest.<p>We believe it might provide the right ingredients for a well balanced culture within our team.<p>But that's only one side of the coin. Somethings can't be ignored and during my exercise in finding the ideal hiring process for programmers, I was made aware of some legitimate concerns by HR people from various types of companies: 
- training someone involves losing money with the promise of seeing a diamond in a rough blossom into a jewel. Can you afford it? 
- programmers, especially Y generation, can be very unstable. You hire someone today and there's no guarantee that he'll be with you 6 months from now. But in your mind, you're grooming him for at least the next 3 or 4 years.
 - there are deadlines. sometimes you need somone right here and now that can land with wheels running. That means having to pass over some really nice resumes.
  - you have a small team and lots of work. Each needs to pull their own weight, there's no time holding newbies' hands.<p>In my opinion, the ideal candidate for your company depends of your short and long term goals with him/her. If you're a startup, with only one product with dependencies on a framework and other tools that aren't likely to change much in the next couple of years, it makes much sense to hire someone already up to speed with said tools, even more so if you don't have the budget to train someone. If on the other hand you provide various services likely to span multiple horizons, betting on people that have the general ability to grasp this stuff is more appropriate. If you're google you can get the best from both worlds.",1291417349
