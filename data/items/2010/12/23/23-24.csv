However, I, too, find there is something worth celebrating: The christmas truce of 1914.

Decide you don't like a file and move it out of your main folder, or have to rerip an album for a reason? You now have to manually move the old files out from iTunes, one by one. I might be able to do better if I let iTunes manage my library, but given how much I prefer other software for playing off the PC rather than the iPod, that wasn't something I was prepared to do and it should be able to handle it better than this.\n* Very basic duplicate files finding, which interacts with the above. Does such a simplistic match that it grabs huge numbers of false positives, making it unneccessarily difficult to find where you've actually got duplicates. You then can't see what the file path is or sort by the missing file marker so it's a real pain to remove the old version and leave behind only the new. Back to removing them one by one.\n* I've no idea what it's doing, but it multiplies artists and albums all over the place. Other music library programs I've used were bright enough to tell that BEATLES, Beatles and The Beatles were all the same band. ITunes isn't, including giving some multiples that appear identical in the interface. It periodically does the same with albums too, making album playlists vastly less useful because rather than one seven track album you have seven, identically named, one-track albums with ascending track numbers.\n* Play me my top rated songs within a genre. Can't do. Show me my top rated songs by a particular band or even within an individual album. Can't do. \n* Podcasts resume part-way through if you jumped out into another part of the software; 'Songs' don't - why? That's annoying with some long classical or prog track, doubly so with a podcast I simply decided not to manage with ITunes (because, frankly, I didn't find its podcast software any better than the rest of it).<p>I could go on... It's one of the worst music managers / MP3 players I've used.<p>ITunes is pretty and relatively easy to use (for simple tasks - anything out of the ordinary is a real pain IMHO) but that's as far as I'd go in its praise. For me they've created an MP3 player which is designed to handle tens of thousands of songs but lumbered it with the software to do a few hundred and left it. That's not good enough. It might have been barely adequate in 2001 (I'm not convinced frankly) but it's an embarrassment by now.",1293146967

This is what distinguishes an investment in a limited liability business (LLC, Corp) from, well, indentured servitude.<p>I'm assuming their investment in startup #1 was made freely and without deception - they took a risk, like many other investors in many other startups, and it didn't pan out.

Assuming everything was above board, they knew what they were getting into, and you don't owe them anything more than your best efforts in that venture.<p>Now, all that is not to say that you should be a jerk about it.

No one is recording, so there is no fixation.<p>2. Someone else hears your poem, goes home, and writes it down from memory. That's not fixation, since 17 USC 101 defines one of the elements of fixation as being by or under the authority of the author. So, the work is still not fixed, so copyright has not yet attached.<p>3. That person starts making and selling copies of your poem.<p>4. You finally write down your poem. It's now fixed, and copyright attaches.<p>I would presume that you can now stop that other person, via copyright law, from making any more copies. Is there any case, though, for damages from the copies that were made and sold before #4? Can you prevent the distribution of the copies #3 has already made by not sold? Can you prevent the people who have bought copies already from reselling them, or does first sale apply? (First sale only applies to copies that were lawfully made and so usually does not apply to works that were not authorized, but in this case the work was not under copyright when the copies were made so I would think they would count as being lawfully made).",1293146522

In a double blind study) the people interacting with the patient don't know who gets which either - so they aren't deceiving the patient, they genuinely don't know.<p>Secondly, in this case, what if the placebo is not genuinely inert? The 'placebo' was cellulose (dietary fibre) in a gelatine capsule, and apparently fibre is the standard treatment for irritable bowel syndrome.<p>Thirdly, showing that open label placebos might be better than controls is not enough to justify using an open label placebo in a clinical; instead, they would need to have compared an open to a closed label placebo. If a closed label placebo works better than an open label one, then a drug which is not efficacious could be accepted by a clinical trial because it was an unintentional closed label placebo and did better than the intentional open label placebo. In addition, closed label placebos are not just for the patient - they also play a role in double blind clinical trials of keeping the doctors dealing with the patient / assessing results from knowing.",1293146338
