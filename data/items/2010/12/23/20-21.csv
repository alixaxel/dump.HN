The ability to get that done is called ""political power"".<p>Of course, normally it doesn't come to that, but the threat has to be real otherwise those naughty people will just go right on selling coffins.  (My goodness, they might even be <i>unsafe</i>.)<p>Yes, people often seek political power in order to maximize their economic power.  And people with economic power can often gain political power.  Nevertheless, the two types of power are distinct.  Political power is the ability and willingness to initiate force against others.  Economic power is the ability to deploy capital in production.  Just because one can be used to pursue the other does not make them equivalent.",1293137991

The Groupon offer is thus better viewed as a heavily discounted gift certificate.  Otherwise there is little difference other than the scale.<p>As to whether you are too cheap to buy a coupon?  Unlikely.  More likely you are insufficiently cheap for the idea to hold appeal, as you are OK with buying the product you want when you want it, rather than jumping through all sorts of hoops and advance planning to save a few dollars.  You are welcome and possibly correct to view this as 'wise'.",1293137796

When he says ""teaching C in practice,"" he doesn't mean teaching C-isms in a C++ book — he means C as it is (incorrectly) used in practice, such as teaching implementation-dependent assumptions and pretending that they're part of the standard, as well as simply wrong code that might appear to work right ""in practice"" in certain situations.

The reason was his experience with the Difference Engine. Because the D.E. would be useful for accurate, error-free charts for the British Navy, he felt that the Government should pay for it. And he did get an agreement with the Gov, but getting the money out of them was like getting water out of a stone. He was so disgusted by the whole process, that he resolved neither to finish the D.E. nor to even start the A.E.

Certainly a market with government handouts or regulations that bias the interests of some players over others is less free than a market without such interference. I think we can say that the transportation market was ""more free"" after competition killing regulation was removed from the trucking industry under the Carter administration, for example[1]. (People forget about Carter's libertarian streak, but libertarians don't. You can also thank Carter for deregulation of air travel[2] and delicious microbrewed beer[3].)<p>Rather than lobbying to bias the market in favor of our preferred people, as you suggest we do, it is perfectly possible to lobby in favor of less special-interest rules. In fact there is a significant minority of people in this country who do just that.
