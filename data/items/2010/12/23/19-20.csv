I can mostly agree with the arguments for the model, but don't see what particular advantage Groupon has as a company that would justify its proposed valuations.<p>As a merchant, I've been in contact with Groupon and have looked closely at their system.  Everything makes sense to me about it other than the cost.  To use them, I'd need to be selling something at a 70% discount (their take is half of the discounted price), which for me means selling for about 50% of my cost to produce.   For some businesses, this is a justifiable marketing expense, but for me, I think there are better ways to benefit from giving away things for free.<p>While there is considerable consumer loyalty to Groupon, I don't see any such merchant loyalty.  As soon as someone offers me a Groupon clone that offers to take only 10% of the sales, I'm there.  Why doesn't Google put its $Billions into attracting merchants to a new site rather than buying an existing site that looks extremely vulnerable to future competition?

If you're going to have to pick your battles, pick one that's worth winning. If the US became a nation of engineers and designers and businessmen, that would do more to support a middle class and a high quality of life than if the US went back to being a nation of factory workers and coal miners. And it turns out the US has a lot of things--a vast, high-quality higher education system, a relatively free market, a culture amenable to entrepreneurship--that give us competitive advantages in these fields. What competitive advantage do we have in manufacturing?<p>Maybe the one thing holding us back is a lack of appreciation for great design. Apple is truly an outlier in that respect.",1293133013

In established markets almost every deal tips.<p><i>many merchants are not sophisticated enough to structure their deals properly such that it is economically beneficial to them</i><p>One of the services that the margin on the deal pays for.  G wants the merchants to have a good experience (95%+ report that they do) and continue to use G as opposed to other deal sites.  Deal makers here structure the deal to maximize benefit to the business.  That's why you'll get $20 for $10 to a sandwich place, $10 for $4 at an ice cream shop, and $50 for $25 at a steak house.  This is with the insight of all the other deals made in your city.<p><i>Merchants must give blanket discounts, and have no ability to segment or run comprehensive campaigns. In particular, merchants can not do things like target existing customers with reward programs, and new customers with enticement programs</i><p>This is true for the ""Daily Deal"" which gets the most exposure and are outsized deals.  These are basically a marketing budget spend, but the money goes to G and the customers instead of advertising media.<p>New personalization and deal feed features (currently out in limited markets) let merchants put deals at will to previous and interested customers completely outside of the daily email.<p>Also, G's intention is to get customers <i>to the business</i>, not to take over the business relationship.  Businesses should have their own rewards programs, etc.<p><i>We have three problems to solve; 1) long term economic viability for merchants through assisted program creation, 2) segmentation and campaigning for merchants, 3) relevance for customers.</i><p>#1 is already something we do.  #2,3 exist to a limited extent but we're working (a lot) on improving them)<p><i>What if we had a ""personal fingerprint"" for each consumer that is subscribing or consuming from a stream, as well as the attributes of merchants and their individual campaigns? If that fingerprint contained rich information about their interests, demographic information, and so on, then we could both assist the user in subscribing to only those promotions that meet their interests, and assist the merchant in very fine grained segmenting and targeting.</i><p>It's like you read our mind.  But just as most small businesses aren't good at or interested in marketing, it's the same for segmenting and targeting.  I think as a data-head, Bradford is overestimating how much merchants want to do that.
