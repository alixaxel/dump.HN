We don't memorize facts in order to build intuition -- we explore, discover, and synthesize. Formalism is an impediment to the early stages of this process. The most blatant example is set theory. Nearly everyone has a basic grasp of naive set theory and hardly any layperson has a basic grasp of formal set theory.<p>Just as an aside, many of the most interesting things in mathematics are extremely counterintuitive. It also turns out that our intuition is broken and leads us to say crazy things. Again, set theory has clear examples.<p>Back to the point, the things you memorize help to organize your untamed mathematical data.

However, as far as I can tell (and I have actually done significant research and thinking about this type of business) they are far more lucky than anything else.<p>Not to say they didn't execute well, clearly they did, but there have literally been hundreds of companies both before (restaurant.com, 1999, val-pak, Entertainment Book) and after (Facebook, Google, Yelp, FourSquare, AOL, LivingSocial, DailyCandy, Zip2Save, + thousands you've never heard of) doing nearly or exactly the same thing.<p>IMO Groupon was indeed crazy to pass on this deal. I agree with others saying that there is a high risk that they will be worth far less in a few years.<p>Why?<p>Their model is not strategically defensible, and there are very few barriers to entry.  Look around, anyone with a mailing list or customer base is entering the deals space.<p>Besides that, in the end, Groupon makes money by giving away other people's money. It's great work if you can get it, but this type of business gets very hard to scale past a certain point. While it's great for certain kinds of businesses, it also incites a race to the bottom. I think that over the next few years businesses will get wise to the model and revert to more sustainable discount levels for the majority of situations.<p>In the meantime Groupon will continue to print cash but in the long run there will not be one winner in this category, it will end up very fragmented and very competitive (read: high costs and low profit margins).",1291436761

They have a ton of telemarketers pushing onto every business with a phone number. This reminds me a lot of the ""local directory"" space (which the WSJ article claims they're occupying, but from the POV of the small business owner and the consumer it looks like a very different product). There was a lot of excitement and initial signups when things first got off the ground (just a bit before the bubble burst), but the churn can be horrendous.<p>The difference with Groupon is that the ""ads"" are actually accountable and produce sales compared to local directory ones. But there's been a few horror stories about dumb business owners getting fucked over with ""we're losing $1 on every sale, but we'll make up for it on volume!"" deals. Their own fault, but I bet the Groupon telemarketers are pushing it on them like Walmart pushes on suppliers.<p>What I'd like to see is the current churn rate.

If you look at Wee, the user of the framework has to callcc all over the place to make it work.  In Tir I have web:prompt(), which itself does the yielding without anyone having to care.<p>The significance of this is that Tir can provide one API for all three styles without special effort from the user.",1291435649

I'm reminded of an interview[1] with Shigeru Miyamoto and Satoru Iwata discussing the first level of Super Mario Brothers:<p><pre><code>  ""But if you avoid the first Goomba and then jump and hit a block above\n  you, a mushroom will spring out and you'll get a shock. But then you'll\n  see that it's going to the right so you'll think: 'I'm safe! Something\n  strange appeared but I'm okay!' But of course when it goes against a pipe\n  up ahead, the mushroom will come back.\n\n  At that point, even if you panic and try to jump out of the way, you'll\n  hit the block above you. Then just at the instant where you accept that\n  you're done for, Mario will suddenly shake and grow bigger! You might not\n  really know what's just happened, but at the very least, you'll realize\n  that you haven't lost the turn.""\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page4.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/nsmb/vol1_page4.jsp</a>",1291435648

They looked up the numbers and had 7 visitors who'd used Opera in the preceding month. They just couldn't justify the expense for such an insignificant percentage of traffic. I think that's going to be your problem everywhere.<p>The only reason to support Opera is personal good feelings toward Opera. The userbase is insignificant, Opera doesn't further any given political goal as they aren't open-source and they are several more-popular open-source browsers in the market that are tested against. So what's the point of supporting Opera other than just liking Opera and wanting it to be usable with your site? Not that there's anything wrong with that, but rarely is it a cost-efficient procedure.",1291435612

We have a PHP backend, actually the same one that we were using with the flash frontend, and are using jQuery with JMVC, and slickgrid for the huge lists of things. The invisible flash widget provides both music playback and serves as a proxy for getting around some of javascript's crossdomain restrictions (like the fact that you can't make https ajax requests on a page served on http) and talking to third-party services like facebook and last.fm which have perfectly nice crossdomain.xml files.<p>Feel free to ask me any questions, though I don't know details on a lot of the deep workings of the backend - I'm an Actionscript/Javascript dev.<p>Oh and thank you so much for <i>not</i> submitting this as 'Grooveshark switches to HTML5'!! Because it's not. We're not doing anything you couldn't do years ago, except maybe that JS performance wouldn't have been fast enough for such a heavy app.",1291435467
