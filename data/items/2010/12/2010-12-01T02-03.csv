1956625,comment,1955559,1956517,0,0,troutwine,,,"I have no doubt that a government could not function without the ability to keep some data private, hence my assertion that Anarchy existed as the consequence of absolute transparency.<p>> <i>But what about more routine things? A lot of times we trust the government to keep our personal secrets. Consider health care. Most governments provide health care to some people in some capacity, be it the local public hospital or through a single payer system like Canada or even the NHS. How do you run one of these systems without protecting the privacy of your patients--i.e. keeping secrets?</i>
>
> <i>Or perhaps we should consider the criminal justice system. No state secrets means no Witness Protection Program. Sealed juvenile criminal records are generally considered a good thing, as is (in some cases) jury sequestration and the identities of rape victims.</i><p>I think that the conflation of individual privacy and the privacy of a government as an entity is erroneous. I can elaborate further, if you disagree or do not see why I assert such a thing.<p>> * Perhaps we should consider diplomacy, given the recent leak. Sometimes diplomatic negotiations are very sensitive, and the smallest leak can catastrophically queer the deal. Consider the Cuban Missile Crisis--a well-placed leak there could have led to war.*<p>I hope to address this below. Please do let me know if you feel that I have not.<p>> <i>Finally, a government that can't keep secrets can't use cryptographic authentication or cryptographic channels for anything, from running an HTTPS service to transferring funds. Hell, they can't even secure their computer networks.</i><p>There is a distinct difference between degrees of openness with regard to citizens and with regard to external peoples. If we posit a totally transparent government, secure networks and the like <i>could</i> exist if every citizen were granted, on request and without possibility of denial, the appropriate credentials.<p>> <i>We would all have the constitutional right to root access on every government computer.</i><p>I don't believe that this deduction necessarily follows. If we posit a completely transparent governmental apparatus, a distinction may still be drawn between a citizen's right to agency and a right to knowledge. Concerns and further objections may be raised, of course. However, I do not believe that total transparency is a feasible model for a government--hence the Anarchy--and do not believe that elaboration on this hypothetical is profitable path.<p>I am not--and I had hoped to make this more plain earlier-- advocating a state with no ability to keep data private. I do not wish to live in a society so ordered. Rather, inspired by the rhetoric of my State officials in response to WikiLeaks' actions, I have begun to wonder at the ideal compromise point between total openness and total secrecy of data. The current and former US administrations have certainly abused the privileged of classifying documents as State Secrets. Though I am a US citizen of voting age, I have no way to determine <i>why</i> a document is given a Secret classification, nor can I make an informed vote on sitting candidates if part of their actions remain hidden.",1291172279

Those iMacs and iPhones don't look so interesting anymore if you can get a HP computer/phone with OS X/iOS two third of the price, one and a half times the performance. I am pretty sure the majority of the Mac users that I know would've bought HP.</i><p>Apple can easily compete on price with anyone nowdays. They choose not to in (low to mid range) computing, but the iPod/iPhone/iPad are ultra-competitive price-wise with anyone out there.<p>The real reason is because Jobs believes controlling the entire experience (both the hardware and the software) gives the best experience for the user. He may well be right, so long as he is in charge of the experience (cite: any other company that tried the same strategy).<p>Steve Jobs is a genius, but he's also 55.

One issue I have with all build systems, Android's included, is the amount of magic that goes on -- variables defined in other files which are automatically in scope for your Make file, and, worse, variables you define being magically modified by something else.

Both HTH and TTH appear before THT, but in the third case THT appears before HTH. So HTH won't work, you both take one of each other's winning conditions leaving you both with 4. But there are no cases where TTH appears after THT, so you have 4 ways of winning while player one only has 3.",1291169345

If you are a middle-of-the-road voter and really don't particularly care one way or the other which person gets elected or which proposals pass, why vote? If things are going fairly well, why vote? Arguably they're doing us a favor by not casting an essentially random vote.<p>In the past couple of elections there's been a lot more participation, broadly from the Left in 2008 and broadly from the Right in 2010. Because not caring has become a lot less rational.<p>Humans aren't rational by any stretch of the imagination but groups of humans are frequently far more rational than supposed, if you take the time to figure out their <i>real</i> incentives and not just the immediately obvious ones, or the ones being loudly claimed. (And yes, I agree there are truly apathetic individuals. But most people read ""apathy"" as simply a variant of ""lazy"" and I don't think that's necessarily as true as it pleases some people to believe.)",1291168936
