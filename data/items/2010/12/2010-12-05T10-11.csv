As you mentioned, attempts are made to fudge the protocol and make it hard to recognize that the BitTorrent protocol is being used.<p>It does not, however, provide any encryption or anonymity for your traffic. All packets are sent in the clear, your real IP address is still shown to all connected peers, etc.; do not rely on an ""encrypted"" BitTorrent connection to save you from a packet-sniffing fiend because the content you're downloading is not given any extra encryption by an encrypted BT connection, because the connection is not really encrypted in the classical sense, it's just obfuscated so that ISPs can't automatically detect BT traffic and disconnect/throttle/filter. ""Encryption"" was a bad thing to call BT encryption.",1291546735

1971396,comment,1971163,1971163,0,0,floatingatoll,,,"""A Transition to Advanced Mathematics"" (0-534-38214-2) at the end of my 6th grade school year, just as summer was starting.<p>I would give this book to myself because it's a bridge between finishing the final class in high school math and learning how to read proofs on arXiv.  The world would be a better place today if I'd known how to manipulate mathematical proofs a decade ago.<p>During fourth grade and fifth grade, i walked across the street to the other school for my math classes.  To this day, people i never knew recognize me on sight as ""that kid from math class"".  When sixth grade ended at age 12, the school ran out of math to teach me (at pre-calculus).  I was offered a choice: bus to the high school miles away for math classes, or take music instead.  I worried that the bus would ostracize me further from my peers.  I would be someone else today if i had chosen the bus.  Fluent in math, certainly!<p>In the years since, I've harbored a desire for a textbook that will teach advanced mathematics to someone with my experience.  I've had this dream of understanding how to consider and construct equations with Hilbert spaces.  I know it sounds arcane and weird, but it's just a few steps away from cosines and bitwise operators.  You can reach into an equation and ""flip"" things over into this weird space with dimensionality that is not constant, enabling solutions that cannot be had simply from high school algebra alone.<p>Two months ago, while surfing a used bookstore's Math section, I came across a textbook with the singularly direct title ""A Transition To Advanced Mathematics"".  It is amazing.  I am reading sections, doing the exercises, checking against the teacher's guide, redoing until I get a right answer or at least ""get it"".  So far, I can handle one section a week, which means I will complete the book in 39 weeks.  (Coincidentally, 39 weeks is precisely 75% of a year, just like American school years.)",1291546432

Typically in a bubble you'll see prices go up and up and investors with little or no idea of what they're doing are lining up to buy stocks that have very little intrinsic value at prices higher than seems reasonable / responsible.<p>If the companies that they invest in commit fraud then that's going to make matter worse but a bubble can happen without any action on the part of the companies invested in, it is mostly an investor issue, fraud is mostly a corporate issue.",1291545965

1971363,comment,1971321,1971321,0,0,iuguy,,,"As a self confessed Martini nut I can tell you two things, one of whom was told to me by Allesandro, head barman at the Duke's Hotel, London where they have a special Vesper Martini that's as close to the original as you can get.<p>In the old days people didn't mix vodka and gin in cocktails as they were much stronger than they are now. In Casino Royale Bond acts a particularly flashy, arrogant show-off type gambler. In the early 50s when the novel is set (although please do bear in mind that the story was heavily influenced by wartime events in the Naval Intelligence Division) people never mixed Gin and Vodka in a Martini, and a Martini was always stirred with a special spoon to avoid chipping the ice.<p>Bond, being the flashy type ordered his Martini with Vodka, which would then need to be shaken in order to avoid the oilyness that came with the potato-based vodkas of the time as per the wikipedia article. The act of it being shaken would've aroused much interest from people who would have asked what the gentleman was drinking, to which the response would seem incredible in a kind of 'who does this guy think he is' type of way. The casino is supposed to be a high brow csaino that will have seen better days, Bond was breaking etiquette to show off how big his balls were and to attract Le Chiffre's attention.<p>The other thing on a more technical point is that a modern vesper cannot be made with the same ingredients as the original (as the formulas have changed). In order to get something close you need a strong but fairly easy drinking vodka (at least 43% ABV), a neutral Gin as close to 53% as possible, Lillet Blanc (a white vermouth) and either a tincture of quinine or a dash of orange bitters. My personal recommendation would be for Berry Bros No. 3 Dry London Gin, Potocki Vodka, Lillet Blanc and Orange Angostura Bitters. Stirring takes longer to cool the drink down to the right temperature (around 1-3 degrees C), whereas shaking takes considerably less time, but you'll get ice particles in the resulting drink. As the drink cools more water melts into the drink, diluting the cocktail. Thus a shaken Martini is generally slightly stronger than a stirred one. The oxygenation of the mix also gives the drink a sharpness that you don't get in a stirred martini, but most people wouldn't be able to tell the difference.<p>The TL;DR for all of this is, vespers should be shaken and not stirred, or poured and layered (as per the Duke's bar), no other martini should be shaken - unless it's pure Gin and Vermouth in which case it can be gently shaken to waltz time.",1291544240

Do you know enough about the industry? Do you know what you're selling? What it's worth to the client? Strengths, weaknesses? Would you spend your own money on it? Why?<p>I've been in your situation before, where I barely could get a word in edge-wise even though I was expected to given my position. It was always my comfort level with the subject itself, not the setting. Imagine being in that same room and the client asks you a question about something you're intimately familiar with (your favorite topic, whatever that is). Could you answer confidently then? I bet you would.<p>If I had to guess I would say you need to do your homework more. You need to be able to anticipate questions and have good answers on hand. That will raise your confidence level. Internalize your company's industry and product as much as possible and then build out a plan for handling more responsibility in client meetings.<p>You can discuss your approach to meetings with your boss first. It would help to go over the subject matter in private (especially if it's new or constantly changing) and it would be helpful to decide which parts each of you will present.<p>You can also do this about Q&A: decide beforehand which areas you will cover and all questions on those topics will automatically go to you. Clearly defining your responsibilities will take a lot of the anxiety out of it.<p>I used to do this with my (quite senior) business partner frequently. We'd take the time to do trial runs in our own board room. It's not magic (meetings are still tough) but it helps.<p>If you are struggling, presenting a plan on how to handle meetings to your boss will also give you a lot of credibility. You're acknowledging that you need to contribute more and most importantly presenting a <i>solution</i> that will help you do that. If your boss is a good boss he/she will run with it and you'll both get what you want.<p>FWIW I've been through it before and came out on the other side. I'm a former marketing exec turned software engineer (the latter of which I'm infinitely better suited for) and probably share some of the personality quirks you've inherited. Before I got out of marketing completely I was considered a strong public speaker and could chair just about any kind of meeting successfully.<p>You're partway there by asking for help. Now you need to build out a plan and involve the people around you. It won't take long to improve the situation beyond that.",1291544058

In recent months he has transformed from an awkward wunderkind with a preternatural ability to anticipate where the web is going, into an amicable executive unafraid of laying out his grand plan.""<p>So, Mark has become better at communicating the vision of where the web is going. And what exactly is this vision? It is that Facebook will grow and expand and with one of the largest audience platforms in the world, any move it makes into adjacent domains (places, deals) will be instantly successful. Talk about self-realizing prophecies and stating the obvious.<p>Next:<p>""In other words, the world will be experienced through the filter of one’s Facebook friends.""<p>If you think this is a strength, it is actually not.

We keep hearing about 500MM active users, but last I checked, they had about 130MM visits in a day, which is not too far off from what a Youtube gets at 103MM.

I was happier, more able to be sociable, and I <i>could</i> get along with people.<p>Now, after a further 30 or more years, I can still see the book's influence as I negotiate deals, manage employees, broker agreements, and generally ""do stuff.""<p>It's now out-of-date, but if you can make the effort to read it in the context it was written, and to ignore the obvious anachronisms, it's still valuable.  The more recent versions try to be more up-to-date, but they lose something as far as I can tell, and I return to the original.",1291543481

1971347,comment,1969320,1971196,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Agreed. With $5m in the bank you basically never have to work again. Retire early. However you don't really have enough to be a philanthropist or start capital-intensive startups. Could become|continue a serial software startup guy, since no risk to your retirement. You have a nice house and nice car and lots of savings.<p>With $500m in the bank, you get the above plus you can be a philanthropist and personally fund many sorts of capital-intensive startups. You have a mansion on an island, and a yacht and a helicopter and many exotic cars.<p>The difference between any two orders of magnitude is never inconsequential, I'd argue. There's always so much more you could do at higher levels. And not necessarily talking about self-ish pleasure-seeking things but world-changing, humanity-improving sorts of things.",1291543349
