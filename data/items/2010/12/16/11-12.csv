Just like how Coca-Cola and Pepsi have two-dozen drink products each even though 78% of Coca-Cola's gallon sales come from actual ""Coca-Cola"".<p>This is similar to how I walk into the grocery store and see beef packaged at $1/lb even though I have a relative in the meat packing industry, that actually packages the meat for my local store and he says they (the meat packers) can't sell it for less than $1.50/lb without making a loss.",1292500759

That's a pretty long trip and even though we had two stops planned it still was going to take a lot of time on unfamiliar roads, plenty of the driving at night.<p>Somewhere in Iowa, about 45 minutes past Decorah a deer teleported out of nowhere in front of the car and we hit it hard enough that the deer was probably mortally wounded (it <i>still</i> managed to run off!) and the bonnet lock had crushed all the way in to the valve cover.<p>The car looked an absolute mess and it didn't look like we were going to reach our destination.<p>We limped in to some sleepy town (2:30 am), some gas station right off the highway wondering what to do next.<p>Before we could even ask the guy that ran the garage came out and said he's already called his brother in law and he was underway. We didn't really get what was going on but since we couldn't really go anywhere we just hung out, 5 minutes later a pick-up rolled in to the gas station with a sleepy looking guy in it. He jumped out, walked around our minivan, asked if it still moved or of we needed a tow. The car still ran (but made some pretty scary sounds) so he told us to follow him.<p>After a few minutes we got to an industrial area of the small town, he rolled up a huge garage door and we were welcomed to his car repair service.<p>In the space of 4 hours he took the front of the car apart, straightened out the pieces that had taken the brunt of the impact, fixed the valve cover with some of the most impressive epoxy that I've ever seen, found ways to get each and every one of the problems the car had to be fixed in a temporary but very serviceable way.<p>Little by little the car looked like it was going to be a reliable vehicle again and at the end the only tell-tales were the dent in the hood and two tie down straps running across it to hold it down (the lock had gone beyond repair).<p>So, when all was done we aked how much we owed him, the answer was simple: ""Nothing. Could have happened to me just the same, and I'm sure you folks would have helped me out as much as you could too.""<p>Whatever we did he refused payment, so in the end we bade our goodbyes and continued to Texas, from there to Fort Collins, Colorado and from there back to Canada, the 'temporary' fixes held as good as could be expected and when we turned the car in for a proper repair it was in a way a weird feeling because we'd gotten used to seeing the orange stripes across the hood :)<p>There are lots of nice people in this world.",1292500506

I would hope that CS students had some personal integrity.<p>Dartmouth College addressed this in a number of ways:<p>1. Collaboration was routinely encouraged, so long as all work was properly credited. You weren't expected to be able to ace some of the theory classes by yourself, for example.<p>2. Many courses included large team projects.<p>3. Each course began with a clear, unambiguous description of what behavior constituted cheating, and which types of collaboration were allowed.<p>4. When caught, cheating was treated as a major offense: a 9-month suspension and a permanent annotation on your transcript for a first offense, and an irrevocable expulsion for a second offense. I was friends with a CS TA who _always_ took the time to ram through these penalties.<p>Even with those precautions, we had a cheating scandal in a non-major course. Unfortunately, it was hard to identify the cheaters, and the usual penalties couldn't be enforced.<p>Still, I do admire Dartmouth both for encouraging collaboration and for ruthlessly ending the academic careers of students who lacked personal integrity.",1292499642

Produced content is better than un-produced content -> This holds true on the internet. Hackers News itself is successful because it is produced.  Even though the community produces the content it is still produced. I can also find a million @pg - ""I focus on the content"" comments.<p>2.) Scheduled release of content -> One of the good things about being 12 hours ahead in beijing is that I wake up and all the content is ready for me to consume in the morning the rest of the day, provides little new content allow me to focus easier on my daily task then be interrupted by this tweet or news article. Sure you want to watch what you want when you want but we knew then 30 years ago when the VHS recorders came up.<p>3.) Large screens are better than small ->  This is definitely true, watching content on little screens isn't that enjoyable, neither is watch horrible quality videos on youtube. Online content catchs up in terms of quality people will watch it on large screen TVs.<p>4.) 500 channels and nothing on ->  I browse about 10 websites out of the Millions on the internet, compare this to TV where I watch 20 channels out of the 500 that is on my TV.<p>Seems like TV and the way it works is being ""Copied and Localized"" to the internet.",1292498853

I don't see them here. I'm considering starting the New Year by resigning.<p>1. You learn a lot: Yes, I'd agree although what you learn might be a lot of internal architectures an systems which aren't applicable outside. I'd agree that you need to experience a big company to get a proper perspective on the rest of your career though<p>2. Smart people: kind of, though there's maybe 10% of the developers here who even touch a computer outside of work... far less do any sort of personal programming projects or reading.<p>3. Large community: true, I've made good friends here and some international contacts though I'm not sure they will come to anything. I came from a fairly lonely road of research/PhD studies and wanted the experience of working in a team. Unfortunately, my ""team"" is now mostly remote and, no matter what anyone says, it's not the same as working with the people in the cubes around you.<p>4. They have lots of perks: No! Our company doesn't even provide tea or coffee. We get health insurance but that's standard for most/all software companies here. Bonuses are small enough that you can effectively forget about them. There's no training budget or internal courses (except on internal processes).<p>5. You learn the art of politics: No, not necessarily. I've had a lot more office politics in the small companies I've worked for. And regardless of the company, I don't play politics. I'm friendly but not fake, I say what I think and I do what I say.<p>6. Time to reflect: That's part of the reason why I'm still here. The work is easy, standards are low and hours are flexible (and bosses generally ignorant as long as the job gets done) so I can work on side-projects in my spare time. The problem is that the lazy work and general depression at work spills over into your side-projects. So even though I have the time I've recently lost the motivation to do much in the way of proper side-project work.<p>7. You get a baseline: Exactly.
