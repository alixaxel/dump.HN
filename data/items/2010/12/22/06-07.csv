The impression I've gotten is that the net neutrality debate has been focusing on the consumer end, not the server end, because there is typically only one or two choices for consumers for broadband internet access.<p>On the website side of things, if you don't like the rules of your hosting provider, you can choose from hundreds of alternatives. Hence, there is much less need for regulation.<p>For home wireless access, there are usually more choices than for home wired access, with at least 4 choices available in most decently populated areas. With 4+ choices, plus open platforms that make it easier to switch carriers, we may not need heavy regulation--the market might be adequate.<p>For home wired, an open system like Linux makes no difference for two reasons:<p>1. As I noticed, not many use it, so even if Linux somehow made it easier to switch wired providers, it would not have much effect, and<p>2. Linux doesn't make it easier to switch wired providers.

With any luck, I'll be able to stop boot strapping in the next 6 months, and leave nursing behind for good.<p>re: sleep apnea<p>The problem with Sleep Apnea, is that you adjust to how you feel.  I thought that one of my biggest problems was the shift work that I was doing.  I would have jags, where I would sleep 4 hours, and then be up for 12 to 16 hours.  Turned out, after a couple of sleep studies I was waking myself up after 4 hours because I was suffocating repeatedly while I slept.  When I woke up after 4 hours it was because my body had jolted itself awake with a surge of adrenalin, because I had desperately needed oxygen.<p>Sleep apnea is correlated quite highly with nasty long term diseases like pulmonary hypertension, heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, and obesity.  Your whole cardio vascular system is over worked because it struggles with oxygen deprivation for 1/3 of each day.  It also messes with your endocrine system (stress hormones, insulin production, adrenalin production, etc...) because your body isn't able to get a full 8 hours of rest and recharging.  Instead, it's is constantly stressed ( releasing adrenalin and cortisol) throughout the night, and it leads to things like constant hunger throughout the day.<p>Since getting treatment, I've lost about 30 lbs, my blood pressure has dropped 20 points.  A bigger personal benefit, was that I found that I was able to get into programming flow a lot easier (not as fuzzy), and I was able to program for several hours at a stretch longer than I was able to 2 years ago.<p>And, I find that I don't need to have a cup of coffee to get myself through the day.  I don't drink caffeine at all, now.",1292999615

And I wanted to ask all the hackers here: should the newest comments arrive on top or on the bottom?<p>It seems to me that, despite the fact that we read books from top to bottom, and most chatrooms have newer messages on the bottom, that the other way is better. Here are the pros and cons:<p>New messages on top:\nThe textbox can be on top of the webpage, encouraging people to submit a message more than if it's somewhere on the bottom, because of its more prominent (and fixed!) position.<p>Using pagination with this style would bring the most recent comments naturally on page 1.<p>Blogs often sort comments this way.<p>Email threads are usually shown this way, for example in gmail or on the iPhone mail<p>It seems this style is more suited to slower, asynchronous conversations<p>Comments on the bottom:<p>Mobile phones typically have the textbox right next to the keyboard, such as on the iPhone<p>People tend to read from top to bottom and they can just keep reading the messages chronologically<p>Pagination would be a little weird though, with this style<p>When uou produce a list of items that is autoplayed, such as a music mix, you want to put later items on the bottom, as there is a very strong precedent for autoplaying or numbered lists to have the numbers increase in the downward direction.<p>Personally for user engagement reasons I would want to favor the newer messages (and textbox) on top approach, which is what email threads, facebook posts and twitter streams do.

The prosecution and law enforcement is playing an iterated prisoner's dilemma and the accused is only there for a single game.  If law enforcement or the prosecution lies then they may get away with it, or they may get caught.  If the latter they can face fines, loss of the status that allows them to practice their profession, loss of pension, and even imprisonment.  If the accused lies and gets caught they are unlikely to face any additional charges beyond the ones that brought them before the court in the first place.

Java ""protected from decay and dilution""?<p>Witch the exception of SUN never liking native interface linking, Java was ANYTHING BUT protected from decay. Java went about adding and adopting stuff, from Swing to generics to annotations to functional stuff, to remoting, to various EE fads of the day, without ever thinking about whats best about the core language and how to keep it clean and agile.<p>I would have liked it if in place of Java we had a purer language, like, say, Smalltalk.",1292997868
