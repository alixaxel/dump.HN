4) Nonsense, all software DVD players I've worked with support straight decrypted VOB playback.<p>New variations on intentional errors regularly disrupt previously released DVD ripping applications. This is a known fact as evidenced by the assortment of results you'll find if you search for ""dvd update arccos"". It's also why a few of the more popular rippers in the past are no longer popular since they haven't been updated.<p>Intentional errors on CDs would actually demonstrate my ""theory"".<p>And in terms of it being a theory, I have anecdotal evidence that multiple people I know were annoyed at the inability of a ripping program they used/purchased to handle a new release and therefore gave up on ripping.

Verbose 'how' code comments usually assume one path through the code, and it only matches my actual path 0.1% of the time. The remaining 999 times out of 1000 all the verbosity just gets in the way.<p>The best idea to come out of literate programming, IMO: order code in the best possible order for reading and navigating, and let the computer figure out how to compile it. That's one thing we've largely gained from more dynamic languages like python and ruby, and from AOP. That's about it.
